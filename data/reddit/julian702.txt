It depends on your outlook and expectations.. If you would like to play around, learn something new, and possibly buy something with them, then certainly!
If you're trying to make a quick profit on the upswing here and are only short sighted... then use extreme caution.
If you understand bitcoin, see the potential benefits to society, and have some excitement, and time to watch some expendable money potentially grow to ridiculous value, then perhaps you can feel a little more comfortable throwing a little more dough at it..
But if you do throw *any* money at it, then please try and spend some of it.

go with any pool that is no where near 51% of the total network hashing power. 
Value in bitcoin is created by demand for its properties: store it in your brain, move it anywhere in the world instantly, no chargebacks, etc. Then there is the demand for a scarce resource.
Bitcoins *are* literally created out of thin air - but through a method of work that is capitalistic, democratic, and totally transparent and fair.

@_date: 2012-11-30 01:55:25
Specifically, [Insta]( They use a shared wallet accounting system. They give you a deposit address and record your deposits in an internal accounting system. When you spend your bitcoins, they don't come from that specific deposit bitcoin address private key, it can come from any other key in their shared wallet. This has some particularly awesome benefits, specifically anonymity. However, by doing this, any bitcoins "returned to sender" will not go towards the balance in your specific deposit address.

Everyone is on their own time scale of saving, investing, emergency spending, and daily consumption.
The hoarding I've done in the last year has resulted in Bitcoin valuation over 200%. When I spend those bitcoins now, I effectively get a discount on what I purchase now. My point is, eventually hoarded bitcoins dont do a thing for anyone unless you spend them. Fortunately, everyone randomly on their own cycle keeps bitcoin circulating just fine.
I've personally bartered several thousands of dollars worth of goods and services in the last year.

I don't see a key export feature in qt 0.6.3 so doing it from the qt client seems unlikely. 
[this script]( will export private keys from your wallet.dat file. It must be run from a commandline and it requires Python (a programming language/interpreter). Once you have exported your keys, you'll need to import them with the bitcoind.exe command 'importprivkey. There may be a lot of keys to import/export, so figuring out how to do this with a batch script will save you tones of time. Alternatively, you can send me your wallet files to me and I'll do it for 1 BTC in two snaps lickety split.
edit: Your best bet is to just open each wallet file and spend the bitcoins to another/single wallet. That's the easiest, safest method.

1) grow your network of friends that are like minded. I've spent several thousands of dollars worth of bitcoins for goods and services between friends. example: I have bitcoins and I need a hotel room and they want my bitcoins. they get my room on their credit card, I give them bitcoins. there's tons of ways to barter like this, like with wish lists, etc. If you're ancap, you'll look for ways to get out of the system like this.
2) dollar cost averaging is the way to go and go long. I purchased from .06 USD through $32, through $2, through $12. So far, I'm ahead - and I dont even regret the purchases at $32 it's a 10 year investment for me.
3) pros - ridiculous potential for valuation, can't be debased by the state, encourages saving, rather than spending what we don't have; cons - people better learn quick to have safe computing habbits or they are going to lose their shit. there are real concerns about malware attacking wallets. I think bitcoin has the chance to become a world reserve currency, but they better stay offline for the most part, waiting for investments and emergencies - just like the gold bugs do it.

I'm all for having options to benefit competition. But it's no security blanket for participants if the manager of that currency can debase or fraud you from your holdings in it because of lack of transparency. 
And Bitcoin isn't just for people who want anonymity. You can, in fact, tell everyone everything about you at every transaction if you like. It's very easy to not be anonymous with Bitcoin.
Go ahead and support your central authority if that's what you need to do, but eventually, people will be educated about the benefits of transparency, and those markets that are not will not survive.

Another benefit is that you don't have to wait for the blockchain to update. You should probably try blockchain.info/wallet for a more mobile wallet. This way you can keep your savings on electrum in a "brain wallet", a "checking account" on your desktop, and the blockchain wallet for when you're out running around. Diversity is good because if any one breaks or gets hacked, you dont lose everything.

You can't actually add an "actual Bitcoin" to your collection as they are virtual. You can, however, add the casascius coins to your collection because they are real.

It just depends on your friends and your level of trust. If I trust them, they just show me a screen print that they purchased the items, they disappear off my wish list and I know the stuff is highly likely to show up at my door step, so I immediately send them their bitcoins. Otherwise, if its someone not trusted, then I'll make them wait for my bitcoins until I receive the goods from the postman. I figure at that point, there's not much chance amazon will claw them back, especially if I dont sign for anything. Then all you need to do is agree on the exchange rate... perhaps you do a 7 day weighted, depending on shipping, etc.
I think this is a great way to ease friends, neighbors, coworkers into Bitcoin... because they already understand the concepts of online purchases and registries/wish lists... then you help them set up a wallet and send them the bitcoins, holding their hand the whole way. shit, you can even offer to buy back your bitcoins next month and let them see how much they've valued in that time (if they dont want to keep them)

URL is BitAddress.org - not .com
You can absolutely spend bitcoins to addresses created/printed at BitAddress.org. Those bitcoins are now pretty safe offline. However, your two vulnerabilities are 1) now people seeing or recording the QR codes or bytes of the private key and 2) some kind of malware running on your computer at the time of printing/generating that captures key strokes or intercepted keys being transmitted back to an attacker.
To prevent  immediately keep printed keys in a sealed envelope and store in a secure place. To prevent  use a live CD to visit the bitaddress.org site. verify any checksums on the downloaded page, disable your internet connection, and THEN generate/print your pages. that is, you do not want to be online when you generate your keys (page works fine like this).

Personally, if I have $100 to buy a contract, I've got a $100 to buy Bitcoin on the market right now. If I believe bitcoin will be worth more by next year, I want all my $100 converted to Bitcoin right now - as opposed to receiving it back over a year's time while the value increases over that time.
That being said, I see this as being a potentially welcome type of service (with hopefully many competitors) to help secure the network against collusion. As long as the services maintain complete transparency as to their ownership and loyalty to the Bitcoin community and founding principles. Since it is now impossible for the average joe to contribute "honest" CPU cycles to the network, this might be the next best thing. Perhaps it can evolve into branded operations like wikileaks mining or ron paul mining projects where the organization combines ideologies, function, and bitcoin advocacy into one easily supported package.

When the price was $30, we had 6.5 million bitcoins for a market cap of $196m. We've got 10 million coins now at ~$12 for a market cap of $120m. Right now, we only need a price of ~$20 to equal last year's bubble. And in 4 years when we have ~15 million bitcoins, a price of only $13 will equal last year's bubble. As services and adoption continues to grow, I think we'll easily pass last year's bubble market cap.
And we're about to see if miners are saving or dumping real soon. When the reward  cuts in 2 months, we'll know real soon if they are passing their freshly mined bitcoins to the market or savings. If they are saving, the market price won't be affected much. If they are passing current coins to the market, the price is going to rise again as the market consumes a decreasing supply from the miners.

mining is like buying a lottery ticket. The more dollars you have (hash cycles per second), the more lottery tickets you can buy. Each ticket that is bought (hash performed by all the CPUs everywhere in the world) has an equal chance of winning. But statistically, the more tickets you bought (hash cycles you can perform), the better your chances of winning.

As it stands, Bitcoin is already very adaptable to new features and has a relatively large following. A simple fork isn't going to bring enough to the table to interest anyone.

.027 BTC in a few years will buy you a house. But I agree, for us 1st worlders, it's more cost effective to just buy the stuff.
I imagine the prices will adjust as time goes on -depending on a lot of factors. It just started and nobody has published any metrics on how often jobs are being filled.
It is an amazing demonstration of the possibilities Bitcoin affords us though.

with your offline wallet, copy the .dat file to a backup file like "electrum.2012-12-25a.dat", temp file. deseed it with 'electrum -o -w electrum.dat deseed'  # -o makes it work in offline mode
then copy the deseeded .dat file to an online computer.
open the .dat wallet with electrum and let the transactions sync. when it's done copy it back to the offline computer, reseed, and replace the original file. hit me up on IRC if you want some live help

If you want to truely experience the essence of Bitcoin in a most profound way, do this:
Go to instawallet.org and bookmark the URL you're redirected to. Something like " You will need this exact URL to get back to your wallet.
Note the bitcoin address you're assigned. It will be a long string of characters that begins with a '1'. Something like "1DE9EQUdfSZSTSPVnyCsuuaQxuuW9HpHn2".
Now go to CoinWorker.com. Submit your Bitcoin address and select a job from the list of available tasks. Once you complete the task, you'll be paid an amount in Bitcoins - Instantly.
Now this is an important point... Take a good 5 minutes and consider what just happened in the last 5. If it doesn't change your perspective on what is to become of this world, then Bitcoin is not for you.

Because... I want the exchanges to bend over backwards to appease fraud concerns. It is a crucial component of the Bitcoin economy. If it gets shut down by a government because of some people using it to launder money (or what ever), it will bring the entire thing crumbling down. Exchange your BTC privately on OTC if you're that concerned about privacy.
If you're not doing anything illegal, then why dont you just hand over an ID? It has just as much reputation in our community as Bank of America has to the rest of the world. You'd have to provide a state ID opening a regular bank account, so shat is your concern? What do you think they will do with that information?

Yes, I believe the we are better off on a gold standard. It keeps everyone (more) honest, specifically the government because they can't devalue out holding through inflation, nor tax us on the interest for creating that money out of thin air.
But I still have no faith in those that control the government and I choose the "bitcoin standard" because we're all accountable to the mathematical laws of inflation written into the protocol. With Bitcoin, everyone is playing the same game on a level playing field. Bankers no longer get a "handicap".

A currency is an asset/capital and a store of value. You receive some for a good or service, hold it for awhile, then spend it on other goods or services of similar value. While you're holding it, it's store of value. While you're spending it, it's a currency. Because all currencies and goods/services float in value against each other as supply and demand change, it can be used as an investment too.

The thing is with bitcoin... only the person in control of the private keys of a funded address can spend the bitcoins. You can share the private keys, and let other people spend those bitcoins, but then there is no limit to what they can spend, up to the balance at the address.
The safest way to do it is to let the game system create a wallet they manage that allows you to deposit bitcoins. They control the private keys of that wallet to make withdrawls, and have a system that lets you make desposits to fund your gaming and withdraw your balance when you want to close out.
@_date: 2012-08-01 17:54:16
Your question has already been answered, but here's a little more info...
Transactions are made up of inputs and outputs. Fees come from overpayments in the inputs. The miner gets to create an output to himself for any remainder not spent in an output.
For instance, if a person X creates a transaction to Y in the total amount of 5.001 BTC and only signs 5 to Y, the miner gets to throw in another transaction of .001 to his own address. Same thing happens with the block reward. It is an additional input (with no source address) that the miner gets to claim.

Bitcoin addresses are one "key" in a pair of "keys". This keypair are mathematically related/tied together. The bitcoin address you're use to seeing is called an address because it's a destination for other people's money - a place to be sent. It looks like an account number because it's a very unique string of characters. This is the (public) key because anyone can know it. The other (private) key in this keypair is what allows you to spend your money to someone else.
A wallet can have any number of keypair - depending on the client. Some online wallets only have one. Desktop clients can have millions+. Some clients randomly generate these keypair, some are created in a predictable sequence such that you can delete your wallet and recreate every key you had, and will have in the future, from a passphrase.

I'm not so sure it would be as bad as you think. First, only half of the users that were involved in" rolled back" transactions would lose faith because they didn't receive their money. The other half would be OK with their unspent money. Then there's the unknown percent of transactions that would be re fulfilled by honest people. And this number of people involved in this fiasco would be limited to the number of transactions that happens in the attack window.

You don't get to pick the passphrase AND bitcoin address. The math doesn't work that way. Use vanitygen to create custom bitcoin addresses (the private keys will be completely random).
Use those web pages I posted earlier to turn a passphrase into a bitcoin key (the address and private key will be random, but restorable via the passphrase).
The trick to doing this securely is to save the web pages to a file on your computer and open them while your computer is not connected to the Internet.

The other factor that is nearly impossible to gauge is new interest in Bitcoin. That is, people that had only previously heard of Bitcoin and are now "buying in". Aka network effect.

Bitcoin is infinitely divisible. The network just has to agree or split for it to happen. Also, if everyone did decide to split, the inflation engines would kick in again as the current idea of a satoshi would not be the smallest unit of currency after the change. If, for example, everyone magically decided that bitcoin needed 9 decimal places instead of 8, instantly everyone's number of available satoshi would double and every block would again generate new bitcoins until once again the reward reached that new lowest unit of currency.

The collapse was completely due to initial negative events in bitcoin - services lost their customer's bitcoins through negligence, services simply stole their customer's bitcoins, and services were hacked and customer's bitcoins were stolen. These events all happened within a short time of each other and caused the hive mind's first reality check. Eventually, people began to understand that these thefts and losses were not in any way related to the underlying protocol of Bitcoin, but due to misplaced trust in a 3rd party. Since the bitcoin protocol has never been disrupted, we see a continued growth and trust in what really matters - the protocol. Since last october, thefts have continued and people dont even bat an eye any more on the market because they know its not related to the protocol.

I use the heck out of LocalBitcoins. Being in a tourist town, I get a lot of traffic. I have one neighbor that earns bitcoins at their business (graphic design) and I buy a lot of theirs too after meeting through LocalBitcoins.
Meeting in a public place is the best idea. But after establishing relationships with some people we've become pretty casual about it like agreeing to a price on the phone, they send the bitcoins, and I'll pickup the cash on the way home and drive it to their house. Let people know where you're going though, in case you don't show up for dinner ;)
I usually request or start the BTC transfer first, wait for at least one confirmation, then wave the magic hands and the cash appears. Alternatively, on more than one occasion, I've asked that they deposit the bitcoins at instawallet or easywallet, then give me the URL and I spend my own money. It's a very quick transaction then. I have done key sweeping but it's a bit of a chore to make sure you're spending from the right key to your own address. I don't recommend this unless you know what you're doing.
Oh yea, I only do cash-for-bitcoins face-to-face.

You could find someone that wants Bitcoins and ask them to pay for your shipping in return for some of the bitcoins. 
We dont need to depend on merchants and service providers to start accepting Bitcoin for the rest of us to start using it too. The chicken/egg problem isn't that big of a deal. 
At least one of your friends should be interested in Bitcoin. Tell them what you're doing, need dough for shipping, they give you cash for delivery costs, you share some of your auction bitcoins with them. everyone is happy.

It absolutely does function as a currency. I've bought and sold many things with Bitcoin. Granted, there's not a lot of acceptance as of yet, but there's no arguing that Bitcoin functions as a currency.
As Bitcoin becomes ubiquitous (it may take a few years), you wont need to get in and out of local currencies because it *will* be ubiquitous. Trying to get into Bitcoin at that time will take a far bigger investment to make as much as an early adopter. I'm not advising you either way, but thats the hard fact of it.
Hoarders will start letting go for these two reasons: 1) holding them forever will demonstrate a decrease in value as you stated. But it's going to be a matter of individuals deciding on how much they hope to make and how much they need to spend that store of value. Nobody knows that the median outcome will be. 2) people are already starting to realize it's easy to start distributing bitcoins locally to friends and relatives for lunch loans and personal purchases and quickly replace those bitcoins at an exchange. The more bitcoins individuals spread to other individuals, the more ubiquitous it will become.
I'm successfully doing this with coworkers all the time. We go out to lunch, they buy, I give them Bitcoins in return and replace them from an exchange within the week.
I even pay my kid their allowance in Bitcoins. For the most part they are hoarding too, but when we're at a store and they want something, I'll buy it and they pay me in Bitcoins.
It's definitely working as a currency, it just will take all of us to advocate it's use before it become world-wide ubiquitous.

You might be learning this lesson the hard way, but every good disaster recovery plan includes testing your restore procedures BEFORE you need them.
If you have incorrectly recorded your recovery seed, you're going to have a bad day.
What version of the software did you use when the wallet was created? What version are you using now? I would attempt to get the same version for the restore. (it would be ridiculously stupid, but) Perhaps something in the dictionary has changed between releases.

Are all journalists ignorant nincompoop shills for the establishment? How is it that not one major media outlet has discussed the truely innovative properties of Bitcoins - such as 
* your money cannot be destroyed or stolen because it is digital and thus can be backed up, 
* The world has never seen a truly deflationary currency - even gold inflates as more is pulled from the earth or manufactured in nuclear reactors. People are always going to lose their shit over lack of backups and forgotten passwords - making Bitcoins disappear long before and long after the Bitcoin protocol reaches the 21 million limit.
* Bitcoin puts digital keys, available for signing all types of non-reputable digital transactions, in the hands of every day folks - the applications for this are ENORMOUS. 
* Smart property 
* Scripted transactions
For ONCE I'd like to see a major news outlet speak to these incredible points.
Davey Winder and all the others like you, sit the fuck down, and shut the fuck up, you nincompoops.
@_date: 2012-10-25 12:16:15
yes, but because Bitcoin inflation is predictable, this may have already happened. The main question behind supply is: "Are miners hoarding their coin, or immediately releasing them to market?". If they are hoarding, then the supply really isn't going to change much. If they are releasing them to market, then yea, reward halving will cause a shortage in supply and the price will go up. The next question is, did the economy already see this coming and has already adjusted for this from the last steady period we had at $5.
But another thing to consider is that the exchange is an exact current indicator of ciruclation. Individuals and the likes of BitInstant go to market to obtain the currency to buy things. In the case of BitInstant, they are buying to meet demand of their customers trying to buy things. Then you have the BitPays of the world pouring bitcoins obtained from merchants into the exchanges to pay those merchants in their local currencies. Most merchants need their expected value and will not simply do a market order to cash out, they will hold their asks at the rate their goods and services were sold at so there is less loss from volatility. Thats where some walls come from.
It is a beautiful mix of Yin and Yang.

there is a command within electrum that allow you to make the "stuff" of a transaction(mktx).. it's just a digital signature forged by the private key.. it's exactly the same thing as a PGP signature... except its got transaction information... thus, it can't be tampered with... so anyway, once you get this string of text that is the digitally signed transaction, you get it over to a networked computer and inject it into the memory pool. There are a couple of tor/hidden services that will do this for you too... and you don't have to trust them because the bitcoin are sealed up in that tamperproof digital signature.

Basically you hash your passphrase and use that as the seed.
Not much trust needs to go into the electrum servers. Your transactions are digitally signed so they cant tamper with them. The only real vulnerability is getting an incorrect balance for your keys.

nonsense... someone may have been holding the bitcoins for a bit and earned at a lower price. Perhaps they dont want to wait days or weeks to withdraw through an exchange. there are lots of reasons you may be offered a discount on the coins. not everyone needs exactly market rate and the most certainly are getting it back in convenience from a cash/anonymous deal. And you'll never know if the coins are "tainted" until after you receive them anyway.

No, there will be transactional security because the incentive to mine remains in the aquisition of the transaction fees.
The problem I'm concerned about is mining cartel collusion. If we as individual, free traders allow big cartels to form around the mining process, then theoretically, they could collude to choose which  transactions to confirm and do some nasty things.
If we as individual, free traders contribute our distributed "honest node" computing power, we're adding so much computing power to the network individually, that no entity could possibly over-power the network and control it.
To me, it's the same thing as the US replublic. If we remain active in politics and stick to our guns about the principles about how the system works, we can keep it pristine. Let our guard down and "let the government take care of us", then it corrupts itself. Same thing for Bitcoin. Individually contribute our "bitcoin integrity" computing power so that it is impossible for a cartel to take over.

Put up an ad on localbitcoins.com and state you're willing to buy anything at a local store for their bitcoins. It shouldn't be too hard. People already want to meet in a public place to do exchanges. Once the payment has been made at the register, they send the bitcoin and by the time you've helped them load up the goods in the parking lot, you've got a confirmation and ready to say your good byes.

I dont agree with the notion that pools create centralization. People do not join pools and sign contracts to continue mining under any circumstance. Everyone is free to move around as they please. If a pool does something against the community, they can reduce the pool's influence by removing their hashing power. It's already happened.

Name one challenger it's happened to. Liberty dollars? Those were not challenged because they were an alternate currency - it was because Von Nothaus was committing conspiracy and counterfeiting.

What incentive is there to buy a house? Well, how about shelter? That's a pretty good incentive in my book. I'm saving in bitcoin, but i'm also spending and enjoying discounts along the way as my old bitcoin purchases at a low value and buying me more for less now. Even the hardest core saver needs to spend money on consumables, maintenance, and emergencies. Everyone is on their own timeline of saving and spending. Eventually someone every day each year will have reached some threshold and switch from "hoarder" to consumer.

What the hell are you talking about. Obviously your "fundamentals" have not accounted for virtually limitless demand, and extreme scarcity. How many people do you think even know about Bitcoin? (beyond "oh, i heard you haz bitcoinz. whatzit?") My best guess is 1 million people who really understand its potential towards society.. There are 7 billion on the planet and my guess is that if they understood the value of being able to backup their money, transfer it anywhere without cost or delay, and protect it from fiat shit inflation, they'll want a piece of that scarce 9million bitcoins. the "fundamentals" support a price on bitcoin in the thousands of dollars.
@_date: 2012-10-04 15:26:36
mining coins takes processing power. He who has the most computing power has the potential to earn the most bitcoins. its as simple as that.
Bitcoin presents a problem that takes a variable amount of work. If someone jumps on the network with more computing power to solve it quicker than anyone else, the participants of the network all agree the problem needs to be more difficult. If people give up and take away their computing power, everyone left agrees that the problem must be made simpler. the purpose for this is to "regulate" the inflation of the currency into existance and a known and predictable rate. Bitcoin is regulated, but not by politicians or banks, it is done through math.

If I lived in Europe, I'd still reference everything in dollars instead of euros because I am comfortable with using the dollar value of exchange against products and services. And bitcoin doesn't function inside an inflationary framework, it functions along side, competitively. And so far, it's performed thousands of times better than any fiat or precious metal in the same time frame. So enjoy sucking on that big fat cock you can't do anything about.
I'm glad you love bitcoins and follow it so closely, and even that you're getting some laughs from it. But make no mistake, I'll be the one laughing at you in 20 years when it's still around. In fact, I'm laughing at you and your ignorance of its past performance and future potential right now.

Because the "change" spend back to yourself is a new, unconfirmed transaction too.
In other words, if you have 5 bitcoins in a single address in your wallet and you spend 1 bitcoin to your friend, there are two transactions created. One, in the amount of 1 bitcoin to your friend, and 4 bitcoin to an address in your wallet. Both need confirmations before they can be respent.
To get around this, pre-spend some bitcoins to other addresses in your wallet so the cleint can select confirmed inputs for one transaction, and if you do another quick transaction, the client has other confirmed inputs to use.

Hmm. Gartner projects $171.5 **B**illion in mobile payments.

So many people miss the fact that Bitcoin has been a nerdish small community from its beginning.. But as it becomes more established and infrastructure built, more people are going to hear about it and want to try it out too.. There are 7 billion people on the planet who eventually may want to dabble with Bitcoin and there is only a limited number of them to be had. That means, the price must go up as more and more people want some.
Edit: Until there are tens of millions of people using Bitcoin, the price *has* to continue to go up...

blockchain is sounding real good now. To practice with sending some bitcents around, use these online wallets:
* blockchain.info/wallet (recommended for your normal wallet)
* instawallet.org
* easywallet.org
The key to the last two is bookmarking the URL of your wallet so you can get back to it... there are no usernames or passwords for these wallets.. you must bookmark the URL or you will never be able to get back to the same wallet and your bitcoins will be unretrievable.
Perhaps someone else can offer you some mac client advice.

Electrum wallets allow you to generate bitcoin addresses based on a passphrase you remember. Create a wallet from a passphrase, spend money to you those addresses, destroy the computer/wallet file. Your bitcoin keys can never be stolen because the data doesn't exist in any form that is copyable. At any point in the future, you can regenerate that wallet file from the passphrase stored in your brain and make those bitcoins spendable.
This is not science fiction, you can do this right now and it's fucking insanely awesome.

You're leaving out the part where he does millions of computations to create a hash that beats the target. There is a lot of work that goes into solving a block and earning inflation and transaction fees.
It is true that Bitcoins are "created out of thin air", but so are trees as they consume carbon from the atmosphere to build their structure. Point is, there is a lot of work that goes into creating a Bitcoin. A miner doesn't just get to say "50 BTC to me" and propagate it to the network with blind acceptance.

You're absolutely correct... A key point to this is the the argument of anonymity with Bitcoin... From the beginning, it has been touted as god's answer for libertarians because of the freedom it grants through its pseudo-anonymous properties.. but those same keys that allow this type of financial freedom can also be the thing that potentially removes ALL anonymity from the system if a government requires people to digitally sign transactions with a government registered key.

bitcoin's value is based on exchanges that match people up that are buying and selling. Just like any forex or stock market. 
you have a private key that is used to sign off your bitcoins to a hash of a public key (a bitcoin address).
The blockchain contains addresses, but it's more accurate to think of it as an accounting ledger that lists every transaction. basically, a from address, a to address and an amount. The blockchain does not contain every possible bitcoin address - only the ones used in transactions up to now. 
Bitcoin would not work without a blockchain.

no worries. as long as you only keep a few bitcents in a couple wallets while you learn of the vulnerabilities and how to mitigate them, your scepticism will eventually fade. Just take your time.
Start off with an [instawallet]( or [easywallet]( and transfer a few bitcents between them. patience is key because you'll have to wait for confirmations between transfers. Dont forget to bookmark your URLs with these type of wallets or you will lose your shit. Keep the URLs private or you will lose your shit.
Once you get the hang of moving money around, you can consider getting a more secure wallet like [Electrum]( [CoinBase]( [multibit]( [blockchain]( There are many others. research and eperiment with them. bitcents at a time. There's no rush.
From there, make sure you have a good backup strategy and understand taking bitcoins offline with [bitaddress]( or [brainwallet]( And finally, meet someone from localbitcoins.com and buy some bitcoins. They will be very helpful in showing you other things and I promise you'll have some great conversations and sharing knowledge.

There may always be "mandatory reporting" for employers. But if they are accepting bitcoin as payment, and paying their employees with Bitcoin, there is a LOT of room for "fudging". What I like most about bitcoin is NOBODY can just decide they are going to print more money for themselves and gain from its first spend while simultaneously devaluing everyone else's holding. Additionally, everytime someone forgets their password to their bitcoins, or doesn't backup that hard drive and it crashes - those bitcoins are immediately taken out of circulation and increase the scarcity of all the other Bitcoins potentially making everyone else's holding more valuable.

Just a matter of time before the network effect of Bitcoin makes it ubuquitous. It IS a valid method for the storage and transfer of value. There is nothing anyone can do or say to dispute that.
The larger network of people using it, the more stable the price will be - except its rise to a higher value against other currencies and comodities due to the increasing demand and limited supply. My point is, the bigger the network, the more confidence people will have in its long term store of value and savings.
When that happens, Bitcoin will have taken its rightful place right along side all other established currencies. It can never defeat them because of the technological requirements, but no one will be able to ignore it either.
As long as we can maintain (and increase) our current lifestyle requirements such as Internet access), we'll always have Bitcoin and it will be, in many ways, much better than any government solution.

Correct, and I'm betting we have a long way to go before the price stops growing. My point was that I have a lot of faith that this will happen and I'm not hoarding for some "i can retire now" value and then spend my bitcoins. I spend my bitcoins in spite of "knowing" they will continue to rise in price over the next 20 years and the market cap is in the billions.
As for the growth - information tends to spread as long as it has value. I believe the information regarding bitcoin and all its features are very valuable, thus information will continue to spread. We maybe have 1 million users at this point that there's another 7 billion people on the planet to go. That kind of demand, or even 1%, on a well defined scarce resource means there's a lot of growth for bitcoin over the next 20 years.
If you don't subscribe to my believe and philosophy, good for you. But, personally, that's what I'm betting on.

OFFLINE. I recommend using bitaddress.org to create a paper wallet as the easiest method.
If you want real super duper security, use the electrum client. Write down the wallet's seed (that is used to generated all the addresses for that wallet. Fund the wallet and then delete the wallet file.
The only way to recover the bitcoins would be to restore the wallet from the seed you wrote down. (it's 32 characters long.)

If I understand the argument correctly, "money is debt" because of fractional reserve lending and how the government borrows the currency from the FED. Thus the money is created out of debt.
But when there is no fractional reserve or government borrowing to create the currency, I don't see any way how it can be considered debt money. With Bitcoin, every person has to perform some work to obtain it. The work is done in advance of obtaining the Bitcoin, therefore it is NOT debt money.

The addition of increased computing power will not increase the supply of bitcoins. The network will adjust the difficulty of the required work so that it continues to crank out blocks every 10 minutes no matter how much computing power you throw at it.
ASIC hardware only makes the network more secure and forces the expiration of less efficient hardware.

The way you're suppose to use bitaddress.org is to save the html file to your computer, make the browser 'work offline', and open the file locally. That way, the browser is unable to transmit any generated keys back out to the internets.

You just have to hope Instawallet is not the FBI/DHS/DEA/ATF/CIA/NSA or that they keep records that can be seized.
When you make a deposit at Insta/Easy wallet, watch the blockchain address. As soon as you see the wallet service make the next transaction at that address, you can withdraw and you're almost certain to get all new coins. (You'll want to check though). Rinse and repeat if necessary, but probably not.

blocks are blocks of transactions. with each new block comes a reward for solving its problem. The reward starts out with 50 bitcoins and gets cut in half every 210,000 blocks (which turns out to be approximately 4 years). This just happened and now each block reward is only 25 bitcoins now. In 4 years from now, the reward will get cut in half to 12.5 bitcoins. This keeps happening until the reward can't be cut in half any more and bitcoins will max out at 21 million bitcoins (in about 140 years). About 90% of all bitcoins will be generated in about 8 years from now.

* Bitcoin is basically comprised of two things: 1) a distributed ledger of accounts and balances. This is called "The Blockchain". Everyone gets a copy of every transaction that has ever occurred. 2) Asymmetric crypto keys used to receive and sign transactions. Their are two types of keys, a public key (the bitcoin address used to receive bitcoins) and the private key used to sign off bitcoins to another address.
* Blockchain.info/wallet is a good example of a client that lets you access the same keys/addresses on different devices. If you have the android version of this wallet, you can access your bitcoins from the phone or desktop computer via the web interface. It's all the same bitcoins.
* Bitcoin has value because of its characteristics: you can send it anywhere in any amount, it's not seizable, you can duplicate (but not double spend), it's scarce, etc... these features, and the proven security are what bitcoin value.
* There are different types of clients with different requirements and thus offer different levels of convenience and security. The QT client you're using is not the best for a new person, nor people in 3rd world countries with limited resources.  A new person is better off using a 'lite' client that doesn't need to maintain a copy of the blockchain. Instead, it communicates with another computer that does maintain the blockchain and requests current balances and processes digitally signed transactions on its behalf. There is another type of light client that only keeps headers of transactions, but I'm not familiar enough to talk about it. I HIGHLY recommend the [Electrum client]( for a light client because it also allows you to do some ridiculously cool stuff like brain wallets.

it's a matter of determining what's more important to you.. getting in fast or getting in cheap. each has some risks such as if you get in slow, will the price fluctuate past what you thought you were saving?
I pay a $50 wire fee when I send to mtgox, so it really only makes sense if you're buying a couple thousand worth and it takes up to 18 hours from cash to coins.
If you want to go slow and cheap, dwolla/mtgox only cost .6 % plus $.25 but it takes 3-5 days and that's not counting the 30 day setup time (ridiculous, but a one time thing).
BitInstant.com is a good medium solution, but is expensive up to $500 or so.
Coinbase is rockin and SUPER easy for amounts up to $100. Takes 3-5 days if you have a major bank. If not, add another couple days to setup your checking account.
BitMe.com allows for free cash deposits up to $500 a week (US) and it's super fast and fees are less than 1% to trade there. warning: low volume.

8 million bitcoins times the current $6 value means only 50 million dollars in total market capitalization. As more people want to take part in the currency, the demand for bitcoins will rise. It really comes down to the pace of demand, how fast news of Bitcoin spreads between people, and the inflation rate. MTGOX just released some data stating they have 120k account holders. if they've got 80-90 percent of the people trading, that 50 million dollars must only be spread across a relatively small number of people. 200k? 300k?
What happens when the other 7 billion people on the planet want to have a piece of Bitcoin too?
Another thing to think about is how much market capitalization do you think a world currency would have? billions of dollars? trillions? Since there will only be 21 million bitcoins, that means the price would have to be upwards of $50 per bitcoin for a total market cap of only 1 billion dollars.
I dont know when that will happen, but those are the numbers to support a billion dollar market.

because the first rule of blockchain consensus is longest chain is the most desirable reality. Clients stop processing shorter chains once they are made aware of a longer one. A client working a longer chain would not pay any attention to a shorter one. There is no way for them to understand why that other chain is shorter (reconvergence, or hacked chain). Imagine the DoS if every longer chain client tried to validate or otherwise investigate shorter chains. impossibru.

the math problem is like trying to pick a random number between 1 and 16 billion, but is yet less than a target value. Lets say the computing power of the network is X and the target value is set to 1 million... You pick random numbers between 1 and 16 billion possible numbers, but it has to be less that 1 million. if it's over, you pick another random number and check if it's less than 1 million. If it is less than 1 million, then you win the block prize. As more people jump on the network with their computers to "guess the random number less than the target", they will on average guess it faster than once every 10 minutes and the network will decide you now need to guess a random number between 1 and 16 billion that is less than 100,000. This is very difficult, or popularity of Bitcoin fades, or the price drops below the cost of electricity and people decide it's not worth it to mine... now it is very difficult for a block to get solved with the current level of computing power and the network makes the problem easier. Now miners have to guess a random number between 1 and 16 billion that is less than 10 million.
Now, a computer just picking a random number is a very easy and quick task... Imaging that instead of simply picking a random number, you have to do some very computationally difficult stuff to arrive at that random number - and there's no cheating, there is no way to pick a random number without doing this computation.. that is the ELI5 version of mining.
Bonus: the computation a miner is doing is related to information in the previous block, current transactions, and a "freebie" transaction from nobody to the miner in the amount of the block reward. That is how inflation happens - money from nowhere. But as you can see from the example above of difficulty rising and lowing based on the networks' computing power, you can't just make bitcoins really fast AND you have to compete with everyone else.

Lets not forget that Bitcoin requires power and Internet. What happens to the blockchain when geographical areas get segmented or isolated? The blockchain will fork. What happens to the blockchain and regional forks/transaction groups when/if those geographical areas "come back on line"? I *THINK* the most active bitcoin collective simply continues to exist and all other forks just go away. That would be pretty bad. Effectively, everyone in those lesser collectives that spent their Bitcoins after the fork would get to spend them all over again after reconvergence. (longest blockchain always wins)
Correct me if I'm wrong. This really is a doomsday scenario though... it would take a massive catastrophic event for this to happen and we would be fighting for survival if it ever happened.

Everyone is in it for the money. It's a currency.
There are believers in the technology and so believe that it will be a significant technology in the future and thus extremely profitable to hold now.
There are people that see a short term financial benefit to mining. Their honest efforts help secure the trust in the protocol.
There are agnostics the simply like the idea of no fees (etc) and get in/out as required to effect trade.
Another truth is that Bitcoin almost requires a high price so that largish trades don't make the rest of the market volatile. 8 million coins in circulation at $6 is only 48 million dollars. Someone wanting to move $100k around has the potential to upset the apple cart. If Bitcoin was $100, no so much.

An overhaul is not necessary to overcome its issues. The protocol has already developed new functions and features while maintaining backwards compatibility.

I think you're on to something here. I've always been worried about large pools of evil computing power that could destroy or force a bad change to the bitcoin protocol...

1) giving a single address to a bunch of people distributes the correlation of that address and you to many people. They all know you and they can see all the other addresses you do business with (blockchain and all it's transactions are public knowledge). It is better to have a single address for each person you deal with, and ultimately better to give a new bitcoin address for each transaction.
2) To mix your coins, you can pay 1.5% to blockchain.info to mix them for you. Alternatively, you can 1) deposit coins at InstaWallet.org and let them sit for awhile (its a shared wallet system so...) When you withdraw them, you'll have different bitcoins. or 2) meet with a stranger on localbitcoins.com and exchange them 1 for 1. Just remember that you may be leaving some information about your identity at each transaction (coordinating emails, SMS messages, video evidence where you meet up, etc).
The best way (IMO, for now) to manage an anonymous wallet is to use one of the online wallet systems over TOR.

There is no fee to receive bitcoin. So setting the fee in electrum will not affect this specific transaction. But you should set it to a minimum of .001 for future transactions you create from your electrum wallet. This has the ability to save hours of pain and costs almost nothing.
I think the thing you might be waiting on is Bitfloor actually releasing the funds even though the interface says it's complete. It looks like it's been an hour already by the time of your post, but I'd send support a email in another hour or so if you dont see anything.

Bitcoin anonymity requires separate wallets for each identity you use. Otherwise change from illicit transactions will contaminate future transactions from other accounts. Also, funding each identity account from a real-world identity will give you away.

51% attack actually needs to be a sustained attack of at least 75% of the current network hashrate. It also doubles the network hash rate. In 2000 blocks, which will then happen in less than a week, the hash rate will begin to normalize into 10 minute periods again. With a call to arms, this will happen even quicker.
The defense at this point would be to analyse the attacker and blacklist them from the network.

Paypal took about 5 years to take off. I think Bitcoin could do it a little faster for a number of reasons... 1) we're all a lot more connected socially than we were back when Paypal got started; 2) the benefits of Bitcoin, when it is ubiquitous, make Paypal look like a retarded step-child.

That's exactly what I mean.. With a deflationary currency, it's easier for people to save for the things they want to do in life. Everyone can't just hoard or the currency becomes useless and loses value. So they save until they can achieve their dreams of home ownership, capital ventures, their own business, whatever. And niche markets are driven by passion - usually, money has little to do with innovations.

As much as you'd like to fantasize this is how it would play out in your feeble, short-sighted mind, it doesn't ever work out like that (unless you fit the mental state listed below). 
You see, learning about bitcoin from someone you trust and are familiar with comes with a sense of trust that you'll be able to resolve fraud (as opposed to learning it from some random stranger on the internet that you'll never be able to find and break his neck.
As a friend, coworker, neighbor, you're able to see their willingness to try it out. You have the time and familiarity to explain things to them and let them see over time your use and trust in the system. Only a sociopath would inappropriately continue to press people to try something if they already expressed they were not interested.

How do people deal with potential MITM attacks where an onion address "changes"? No way in hell I'd trust a url some "regular joe" published saying "oh hey guys, they changed their address". 
The only way I might trust a "change of address" is if a new one was published on a popular directory and signed with a trusted PGP key.
Additionally, I'd be constantly paranoid that a server got seized, the hidden service keys swipped and used in the next sting operation after they collected a months worth of buyer's addresses.

By the end of the next 8 years when inflation stops nearly entirely, bitcoin has immense potential to be worth several thousands of dollars.

Bitcoiners have come to understand the different between services being hacked and bitcoin being hacked. Some people/businesses need to keep assets in MTGOX for extended periods of time due to the nature of their business and there is just no way around it (until bitcoin is ubiquitous and those businesses don't need to cash out). But there will always be business models that require a stay of assets in an exchange. The average joe, if they can't do their business with the likes of localbitcoins.com, should "get in, get out" as fast as possible at exchanges to reduce their vulnerability to a 3rd party.
As for mtgox being evil, I've broken bread with these guys and they understand their role in the community. They are not evil and they are doing what needs to be done. They are enforcing their AML/KYC rules because they know men with guns will kick in their doors and shut them down at a very critical time in bitcoin's expansion if they don't play by the rules.

Mining serves two purposes... Inflate the currency into existence and secure the network (protect transactions from modification or deletion). Every time a block is solved, transactions in previous blocks are secured by the computational power required to solve the block. Each time a block is solved, the miner gets a reward. The reward starts off at 50 Bitcoins. Every 210,000 blocks, the reward gets cut in half. This works out to be about every 4 years. This is how inflation is controlled and how Bitcoin becomes the world's first literal deflationary currency - it is impossible to create more bitcoins once the reward goes to 0 and we are certain to lose access to Bitcoins through mismanagement and mishap. Once we get to that point, the supply will ever be decreasing.
Bitcoin's rate of inflation is literally and simply a function of time. Electricity costs and network computing power are irrelevant because, as a part of the protocol, the difficulty of solving blocks fluctuates as more or less people participate in the act of mining. Simply, the network will do whatever it can to maintain a block rate of one per 10 minutes.

You need to use the Electrum client. It has command line operations that let you sign a transaction from your offline computer which can then be safely transported via QRCode or USB key to an internet connected computer and injected straight into the memory pool. The commands are 'mktx' and 'sendtx'. Play with it, it's really bad ass. You can use [this]( to export your private keys from your wallet.dat and then use the electrum 'import' (one key at a time) to bring your keys into your new offline electrum wallet.

It doesn't matter that everyone find bitcoin useful or not. It only matters that a good percentage of the people that don't yet know about Bitcoin find it useful. If we're currently at "1 million people on earth find Bitcoin useful" then it is a fact that more people are going to learn of Bitcoin. It is a fact that some are going to ignore it because it is not useful to them (you are right there). But it's also a fact that some of those people are going to like/want it. These are the people that will drive the price up. It won't be 7 billion people. It may not be a billion people. But it will certainly be a much larger number that what is today.
Short of a massive shift in our standard of living (we still have electricity, etc) or a catastrophic problem with the Bitcoin protocol, the price will go up, on average, well into the foreseeable future.

Anyone **who believes Bitcoin will be a globally accepted currency in the next 5 years** should be dumping all their disposable dollars into bitcioin while its under $500/USD. That's a minimum where it would need to be if it was used on that scale.
In 5 years, we'll be at about 16 million bitcoins in circulation. Multiply that by $500 and Bitcoin will have a global capitalization of 8 Billion dollars.
If there's 7 billion people on the planet and even 10 percent of them use Bitcoin, that's 700 million people - That's just a little more than $10 per person using Bitcoin.

inflation reduces your buying power - not increase it. Bitcoin is inflating at its greatest rate right now. close to 33% inflation. In december that inflation will get cut in half. this means bitcoins will become a bit more less accessible/scarce as they aren't being generated as fast. Consumption/demand, however, is increasing. With a limited number of bitcoin, demand requires the price go up.

Also, running the client 24/7 exposes you to some attacks. Electrum solves this problem by allowing you to run your own server and copy of the blockchain with no actual keys being used to store bitcoins. Your electrum client then connects to your stratum server for balance information and injection of transactions into the memory pool.
@_date: 2012-11-08 14:30:31
Electrum and Stratum need help developing their clients and protocol so that keyless webservers can securely receive payments locally without any payment processors.

This could happen if the servers were hosted anywhere in the world. The point is that storing encrypted backups else where, the exchange could " refund" its clients before a judge could make them reveal any keys.
Alternatively, the storage wallet can be multi sig'd with an "unknown" third party, so that even if the exchange revealed is keys, without being able to identify the other required signor, would be unable to seize the bitcoins.

Right, but at any transfer to another Bitcoin address, you have plausible deniability that it was you at that point.
Buy Bitcoins at an exchange. Transfer them to another bitcoin address. buy drugs. police come knocking at your house. you tell them you bought the bitcoins at the exchange for friend X.

Yet. But you seem to be refusing the idea that people will always have reasons to spend at some point. Nobody hoards until death, and even if they do, the money is freed up to windfall the next of kin.
If I bought 100 BTC at $1 three years ago, that means I have $1250 in "free money". Most people could easily justify spending fractions of that value, while maintaining their initial investment value of $100 and watch it continue to grow and build more "savings" to spend that free money value in another 3 years.

You cant use a static password as OTP. My suggestion is that OP use GA for 2factor authentication because 1 device can be used in multiple locations like blockchain wallet, and some other exchagnes.
Then use the yubikey as an "entropy assist" for static passwords. Example, set up the yubikey to so that short press keys 'jurpEcbyepKiavyosghi' and long press keys 'esDisvorrikBuHytutok'. Now you can do all kinds of funky things with strong passwords. Lets say you use it for work and home and at home you additionally have an off-line computer for super secure wallet.
Your password for home is short press + 'barney' (pets name). your password for work is boss's name 'george' + short press. So your passwords are easy to rememeber and hard to guess like 'esDisvorrikBuHytutokbarney' or 'georgeesDisvorrikBuHytutok'. You can even do shit like 'barney' + short press + backspace 3 times. For your super secret offline computer, only use the long press plus some other scheme.

Bitcoin is not a replacement currency, but a competitor. It has some very specific and useful use cases, but it is not likely to replace any government issued currency any time soon.

In my idea, the blockchain doesn't need to contain any links between money and user. The correlation is by a digitally signed receipt the merchant maintains in their own records. If the government wants to do an audit, they can look at the Bitcoin address used to sign the receipt and compare it to it's list of registered Bitcoin addresses. The merchant might have a duty to verify the existence of that Bitcoin address on the government's list of know registered addresses before allowing the purchase.

It's highly adaptable! There is a process called BIP that lets developers evaluate, coordinate, and develop changes to the protocol. I believe this is similar to RFC for the Internet.
With each transaction, scripts get processed to make interesting things happen and enforce requirements for that transaction. There are several standard scripts currently available that enable "wierd" transactions like require multiple keys to sign a transaction. What can be accomplished with this scripting function is limited only by our imagination and ability to negotiate it into the protocol.
Another part of this adoption process is acceptance by the node community. 51% of the nodes must "vote" on the changes by adopting a client that agrees with that new protocol change.

You can't unless that person ignorantly or indifferently reveals information about themselves through transactions with other people/systems. Bitcoin is anonymous. People choose not to be. Even if you do reveal information about yourself at a transaction, it's decentralized information. Someone has to know that person you transacted with and ask them who you are. There are ways to do analysis on transactions and guess who's who, but if you're doing it right, there's always plausible deniabily - especailly if you're using specific wallets for each identity you're trying to maintain - that is, your drug user identity, your meatspace identity, and your animal porn identity.

You are correct, but a person's problem comes from the security of the private keys during their manufacture (specifically) and storage.
In the future, there could be "blockchain aware" malware that looks to see that web page open and record the screen, new files created, or save print jobs, and send the data back to the attacker. If you create a wallet, it MUST be done from a live distro. That is the safest, most paranoid way to do it. Then care must be taken to only print the key to a printer with no long term storage as xgw44535435 says. If you save the pdf to a usb stick for transfer to a live printer, you need to be paranoid to wipe disks afterward, make sure you own the network and the data can't be sniffed, etc.
The level of paranoia you apply to key generation is directly proportional to the amount of value you think you'll be storing in this system.

Anarchy is all about volunteerism and non-aggression (except in self-defense). I dont see how this could be more closely related to that golden rule. As far as governance, subscribing to someone's security service for your protection against those who would violate your anarchist prinicples is basically paying the state through taxes to do the same thing, except, you're not also supporting the state to make up all kinds of other bullshit arbitrary morality rules for you to follow.

I meant assisting the circulation of user's bitcents as upvotes. i.e. they could either have a wallet you could fund with bitcoins and pay other redditors everything you clicked the upvote button, or enabling a way for redditors to register a bitcoin address and display it when you click the upvote button so readers could tip them.

Create a wish list then post the wish list and ask someone to buy the stuff for you. you negotiate on how to repay in bitcoins... for instance, if you have never transacted with them, then you promise to pay bitcoins upon receipt of the goods. negotiate what price to pay before hand... like if shipping is going to take a week, then you might choose the 7 day weighted average exchange rate. if you trust them, then you can send them bitcoins immediately at the 24 hour weighted average excahgne rate.
@_date: 2012-01-13 21:15:51
ugh... you're not signing any receipts with random bitcoin keys. You're required to sign with the one that you registered. How would they know? The government publishes a list of "registered" bitcoin keys (no identity links required). If the signature doesn't match any on the list, its invalid.

as hazek has already explained the why's. I'd like to reinforce the idea of using a light client for new people. Such as electrum, multibit, blockchain.info/wallet, and even the coinbase.com startup as most funds are reported to be kept offline and they make it super easy to get in/out of bitcoin. For small amounts, it should be a safe bet. With these light clients, you'll always see and be able to access your funds immediately since you dont have to wait for the blockchain to sync.

@_date: 2012-06-25 11:59:17
I dunno brother, I think you should look into electrum a bit more. Much less system requirements (RAM), no blockchain to maintain. Electrum actually supports the idea of "brain wallets" so you dont need to store anything on disk. Simply "restore" the wallet to a ram disk from memory. Even spending money can be done without a network connection. You can create "watch only" wallets by removing the seed data.
For offline wallets, not having to maintain a blockchain is F'ing hawt sex because it by nature should never connect to the Internet. So having to update the blockchain after long periods of being offline sucks because it's that much longer to be vulnerable to attack. Electrum is the only client I know that can permanently operate completely off-line at every step of the way.

I really dont understand you people that cry bubble at the slightest increase. You MUST have some notion that our community is small, perhaps one million people?.?. You MUST have some notion that our currency is scarce. You, as an individual, seem quite happy paying your $12 for bitcoins right now. You CANT have any notion about how fast and far bitcoin might spread to people who haven't yet learned of bitcoin. What do you think will happen when that information spreads and people just like you want a piece of that scarce commodity? How is that a bubble? It's a freaking market driven price and you have no control over how fast other people in the world are going to adopt your same demand for this commodity. Upon some great, massive awakening, it could be $4000 over night thanks to the virility and speed of the Internets.

This is a work in progress. There are at least two strategies to make this happen. 
 - Individual network effect: you tell a friend and get them addicted, they tell a friend, and so on. Eventually one of these people is a CEO or someone empowered to make this kind of change in their organization.
 - Advocacy campaigns: start writing letters to businesses to inform them of their options, your desire for an additional payment system, and encouraging them to accept bitcoin.
 - Both 1 &amp; 2 at every opportunity. 8D

This is exactly how we do it. Network Effect. When the number of merchants grow and demand this payment option from Etsy, they will either take the couple of weeks to develop and test the integration, or some other shopping platform will and all those merchants will migrate. Some of us are already playing Shopify against Etsy to get one of them to market first. It will be a big news day for that first one, for sure.

Set your buy price a few pennies above what was the last price. This way you're sure your order will go through at the lowest price possible but still go through if the last prices goes up due to other traders. The system will only buy for you at the lowest possible price even if you said buy at a higher price. This is mostly useful if you're purchasing a large quantity like $1000 or more.

My view is this.. The potential valuation based simply on the demand caused by network effect is greater than the loss of interest of those already involved.

From my understanding, a 51% attack only has a 51% probability. It's more like a sustained 80% attack to be successful. Nobody should be accepting a significant amount of bitcoin without multiple confirmations so this is really only a problem for small amounts. While much more probably than a straight up duplicate key generation, an 80% attack is not anywhere near a plausible attack with todays network hash rate - not even thinking about october's hash rate.

I've been working this gold shop near my house in vegas. First time I went in, I dropped off some materials and got the standard "thanks we'll look into it" response. Second time, I took in some silver coins to get appraised and had a conversation about Bitcoins. It took the owner about 5 seconds to say "no interested. I dont know anything about computers". I thanked him for the appraisal and told him I'd get a second opinion and return to his shop if the second was reasonably close.
On my third visit, about a month later, I went back in and they reappraised my coins and offered me about $140 more than before (sweet!) and had the discussion again. I got the same response from the owner, but there was an old guy who started asking some questions about how it (virtual currency) works. Not so much the protocol, but how it exchanges and is used. I showed him my phone wallet and described the exchanges to be just like a gold exchange and he got it and said he'd google for more information. That's a bit of a scarey prospect with all the fraud press out there. But I plan on returning in a week or so and seeing how it turned out.

Because they are leaving their Bitcoin at these services. I am potentially out some of my USD I had stored at BitFloor waiting for a purchase. I usually never leave Bitcoin at another service unless I'm willing to see it disappear (like blockchain so I can send/receive bitcoins for lunch/beer/etc). I felt OK leaving dollars at an exchange because of the traceability, but I've learned a hard lesson that those funds might go to people who lost bitcoin because of some bankruptcy laws.
Bottom line is, with bitcoin, you're responsible for your own money and should trust a 3rd party as little as possible. I keep most of my savings in bitcoin in an off-line brainwallet, backed up with shared secrets so my family can rebuild my wallet in the event of my death. My bitcoins will not be stolen unless my family, friends, lawyer, and employer colludes against me.

Bitcoin is absolutely deflationary. Bitcoin can't stop governments from inflating their fiats, but it absolutely gives individuals an alternative for storing their value in such a way that prevents loss of value due to long-term inflation. 
For now. 
But if care is not taken to prevent large pools of miners from colluding and having the power to influence to protocol, that could change. We as participants in the peer-to-peer network need to constantly and viligantly need to protect how we want Bitcoin to operate by voting with our own mining clients - with no expectation of receiving inflation rewards or transaction fees - for no other reason than to apply our personal financial philosophy and democratic vote, as a peer in the network.

Why is "Tangible" so important to us? Because it is easy to demonstrate posession and we have enough faith in physics to know that thing which we hold is somewhat scarce and can't be duplicated. And theft of a tangible item comes with risk of violence or criminal civil action.
Bitcoin, while intangible, still maintains these properties except the feely part. You can exercise your control over bitcoins by hiding them or giving them a way. They cannot be duplicated in any meaningful way (double spent). Cryptography and secure computing protect from theft. And given sufficient evidence in a court of law, the theft of bitcoins could result in a conviction or at least civil action.
"Intangible" isn't a problem if you understand that privacy (ability to keep a secret) and the cryptography behind Bitcoin offer just as much security, if not more, than a tangible valuable item.

Instawallet and EasyWallet are excellent services with a very good track record for security and availability.

You do know that for each of the 21 million bitcions (it's not 23), there are 100 million satoshi, right? A satoshi is the smallest unit of bitcoin and each bitcoin is made up of 100 milllion of them.
As for hoarding, it's not a problem. I have bitcoin and believe they will be worth thousands in the future. But I have no problems with spending the ones I got a year ago because due to their valuation, I'm effectively getting a discount on my purchase now from my money saved previously to the point that its worth it for me.
Additionally, people have unplanned necessity in life. Car breaks down, peole get laid off, sick, etc. And each person is on their random life schedules. These events break the hoarding cycle and cause people to spend their savings.

You're missing the point of signing transaction receipts. They sign receipts with a single key that is registered with the government. These receipts were paid from any bitcoin address but are linked together by the signature from the one.

The difference is targeting... It would be impossible to bruteforce everyone's wallet. But if you're targetting the keys for known lost stuff like the bitomat keys, you have a much smaller job.

You should always be able to tell if a key is yours. You don't need gpg for that - it's in your wallet.
gpg by itself doesn't cut it because anyone can create a gpg key with any arbitrary identity information on it. Web Of Trust or a CA is required to provide authenticity. I like where the Electrum client is going where you can simply pay an email address and the client extrapolates URL information from user to  which is a text file containing a bitcoin address. But not every client supports it.

I would NEVER trust anyone with my bitcoins, so no, I would not "invest" them in anything. I'd be perfectly happy with "investing" them into an unhackable, undestroyable cold storage wallet and let the network effect create all my valuation. Clearly, I understand security and economics.

The deflationary spiral might be true when there is only one currency... But Bitcoin is a better savings alternative. People can hoard their Bitcoin as savings and will spend when they have acquired the capital for their venture or pull it out for that rainy day emergency. All the while they can use their government currency for the things they need now or build up their bitcoin savings.

BTW, with electrum, having a truly rememberable passphrase/wallet seed is not very intuitive (yet). By default, the seed will be a random string of words or an interchangeable 32 character string. To make a custom passphrase into a seed, you'll need to learn about hashing.
As an example, find a "sha256 online hash generator" and play with typing in different sentences. You'll see the generator make long random numbers out of your passphrases. These random numbers are what you would seed your Electrum wallet with. When you're ready to make your super safe Electrum wallet, you'll need to find a way to hash this passphrase locally on your computer (and not rely on an internet service because you'd be transmitting your passphrase over the Internet).

Every 2016 blocks that are created, there is a consensus across the network nodes that determine how long it took to blast through those blocks. On average, it should be about 10 minutes each, or about 2 weeks per 2016 blocks. If there was sufficient computing power to get through it faster, then everyone decides the problem needs to be harder and they derive a new difficulty level. If there was insufficient hashing power to do the 2016 blocks in 2 weeks, then the nodes agree the problem needs to be made simpler and they derive an easier difficulty. It's all mathematical so there's no arbitrary decisions made by any node. The new difficulty is computed and it's something like picking a number and then all future block hashes must be less than that number.

Contrary to what people say, Bitcoin (the protocol) IS absolutely anonymous. However, we tend to leave tiny bits of distributed information about our meatspace identities at almost every purchase. Bitcoin helps hide this through change (what was payment? what was change?), using distinct wallets for sub-identities (one for drugs, one for groceries), and downstream (faked) transactions add plausible deniability (I traded those coins with some random person on the street).

No it's not and no it doesn't. A deflationary currency encourages personal savings over letting a central bank create money out of thin air and charge you interest for its use. Everyone in life is on their own time schedule to save and spend money. Not everyone is going to be "hoarding" at the same time. People have projects they want to accomplish and emergencies they will need to attend. Their Bitcoin will eventually be circulated/spent. In the meantime, it won't be debased by some "authority" for their own benefit.

There is no such thing as fake walls. They are real walls that can be taken down by anyone with enough resources.
My take is that there are a lot of businesses that post their earnings on the exchange to fund their operations in cash. They must sell those earned bitcoins at the rate of exchange at the point of sale to maintain profitability. Or perhaps, they set their ask a little higher for additional profit.

You can duplicate your private keys that sign money off to other addresses all day long, but you can never double spend your inputs.
You can mind blocks all day long to earn reward coins, but nobody else will recognize them unless you can produce the blocks faster than the rest of the network (as mpkomara stated).

There are two kinds of inflation: Monetary Inflation which is the increase in monetary units in a system, and Price Inflation which you describe above.
Price inflation can be caused by monetary inflation as more units of the currency in relation to a commodity fluctuates. Also, price inflation can happen by shortages or overages of the commodity in relation to the units of a currency against it.

Under what justification are they going to do this? Especially if the exchange is following all AML requirements and business licensing.
If you look at what Bitcoin is, it litterally comes down to a free speach issue. Spending Bitcoins is a digital message with a digital signature like PGP. The US already tried to shut that down but gave up.
And even if they did try, are you going to lay back and accept the government's removal of your freedom to speak? Are you that afraid of them? What else will you give up in your life so that they don't come and kill you and your dog? What the fuck kind of world do you want to live in?

You dont necessarily have to wait an hour. The longer you wait, the more confidence you have. If you're buying a coffee, the cost of doing a zero confirm attack is probably not worth it. If you're selling a TV, it makes sense to wait for one confirmation (or get some id). If you're selling a car, then you'd want 6 confirmations (but even then, a dealer's got all kinds of other identity information to prosecute a fraudulent spend).

localbitcoins.com lets you use tags for market prices and use them in custom formulas so I dont have to mess with my ads once they are created. I charge 3% either direction and I can usually get my value converted back the other direction pretty quickly so that I dont lose any on the price volatility. sometimes this is done through good timeing of locals buying bitcoins from me and tourists selling them to me. If the market is fluctuating much, then I'll either charge a bit more margin or not do the deal at all. I turned one visitor down once when the threat of pirate dumping was going down. A few weeks later the visitor came back to town when things were stable and we did the trade.
when transacting, I only do cash face-to-face in an active public place (easy to find in vegas). The exchange goes in my favor first since I'm the established one - i.e. if i'm buying bitcoins from a stranger, they send the bitcoins first, then I'' give them the cash when one confirm goes through. an exception to this is if they spend their bitcoins to instawallet before the meeting and give me the URL so I can spend them to my own account. then we dont have to wait for any confirmations because I trust instawallet.
for regular customers, I've made deals on the phone, they send coins and I'll drive the cash by their house at the end of the day, etc. Just depends on my level of trust with them.
Oh, and I'll usually lock in a rate from the 12h weighted for another 12 hours.

I think it all depends on the value the world population puts on a Bitcoin. If Bitcoin goes to $100 USD, you can bet many more miners will contribute many more Th/s to the network because the inflation reward is worth the cost of hardware and electricity - even as the reward cuts in half.
Everyone seemed very happy with Bitcoin sitting at $5 while the inflation rate was 33% or 50 BTC every 10 minutes. Everyone now knows that that is cutting down to 25 BTC every 10 minutes in a few months and we've nearly doubled the price of Bitcoin since to cover the same mining income.

It's the most wonderful and graceful configuration of Symbiosis I've ever seen.

The second they say "what if the crypto gets hacked" I say "bitcoin uses the same crypto standards as "real" banks. We are all in for a serious amount of butthurt if that happens".

tails is derived from debian. the package manager for debian is synaptic. run the package manager and see if you can get pip installed. it may not be called pip, so look for python-pip or pip-python if it's not. once you have pip installed, you should be able to run the electrum install command and get going.
however, I've never used tails, or a live distro to this extent so I dont even know if they've rolled in a package manager and the ability install more packages to the live system. That's the direction I'd try though.

Yep, same here. Wallets are AES encrypted in the client by your passphrase before being stored on blockchain servers. The vulnerability is their javascript being hacked to reveal your keys. For discretionary amounts, like lunch money, I feel it's perfectly safe. That's the risk i'm personally willing to take. I've had as much as $1700 worth of bitcoins for a couple days during defcon and my wifi enabled lol... didn't lose a single satoshi.
Since new users are not likely to have hundreds of dollars worth of bitcoins, it should be safe enough to start with and get the hang of things.

Technically, transactions can be signed off-line and transmitted to the network through via proxy/normal node. This would offer the highest level of anonymity. I believe blockchain.info wallets might allow you to do this.

Just an FYI... You can pay rent with Bitcoins in Las Vegas at over 100 residential and commercial properties.
But to your question: I have paid thousands of dollars worth of Bitcoins for products and services just since January. Mostly it is through barter, but from my point of view, it doesn't matter who I'm paying as long as I get what I need.
Examples: Paid for about 5 nights of hotel rooms with Bitcoin for the San Antonio Bitcoin conference. Paid about $1000 for motorcycle and gun parts, and probably $100 in little electronic gadgets/projects (most of this stuff was via an amazon wish list: friends bought it with their credit cards and I sent them bitcoins).

This is why I say that Anarchy is utopian... there's not a chance in hell the state will give up it's power to make arbitrary laws, tax you for their "protection", and otherwise enforce their will up us with their monopoly of force. But if society was to evolve to the point of an anarchist's utopia, "competing judicial systems" would arbitrate resolutions to conflicts of very simple, objective rules of society: dont steal, dont kill, dont fraud.
I would gladly settle for a state minarchy that its only duty is to protect society from fraud and violence.

True now, but not necessarily in the future when transactions will be pruned from the merkle tree.


This was confusing to me initially because I assumed you were talking about the inflation award at each block. It took me until the next paragraph to figure out what you meant.
I'd recommend a slight rewording so that:


@_date: 2012-10-29 17:14:23
Each bitcoin is worth $10.50 at the moment.  That number comes from an open, free market exchange. Not sure where you're getting this "no actual worth of their own" figure. Also, if the economy is so toxic, why not promote the "legitimate" market and entice this merchant to make it more so?
@_date: 2012-11-11 12:30:02
that is not how bitcoins are mined. this kind of "recovery" is not compatible with the current protocol in any fashion.
@_date: 2012-07-10 16:23:22
The difficulty is fundamentally determined by the current computing power. If the current hash rate is 1 terahash, then you need your own 1 terahash (minimum) to do the attack. this doubles the network hash rate and the difficulty will be recomputed in 2000 blocks.
The difficulty absolutely affects the ability to do a 51% attack because it defines how much computing power you need to get to 51%.

@_date: 2012-08-15 15:22:11
Backup your wallet.dat every 50 transactions or so. The number is actually 100 I think, but 50 is safer. The reason is keys are generated as you do transactions, but also queued up 100 in advance. If you have to restore a backup older than 100 transactions, then you'll be missing a few keys that may hold value.
With QT, you'll run into problems if you share a wallet because the keys are created randomly. If you use Electrum, the keys are generated deterministicly, thus the original seed will (re)create every key you'll ever need sequentially.

* I would like to see you adopt a blockchain style system where I have the ability to export my keys in the event your service goes away or is down. This would also include my keys be encrypted in my browser by my passphrase. I think a lot of people need to maintain this kind of control over their money. You getting hacked and losing everyone's money all at once is not a good experience and a huge hurdle for people.

ASICs are coming. It's dumb to argue this right now. My money is spent, I have faith they will come through and all you can do is speculate and spread FUD.. So keep talking shit about this if you must, but it changes nothing. What will happen is going to happen and we can discuss who was right and who was wrong when something official happens.
As for time showing bitcoin is a great way to make or lose money, bitcoiners certainly have the win. It's up $13+ from 4 years ago. The crash from $30 didn't kill it and proves only that speculators didn't have a firm grasp on what bitcoin is and what got hacked. We've been on a steady rise from $2 for over a year now. So, you lose at arguing it is a loser.
There are fraudsters and thieves to a much higher degree in (pick any) fiat currency. This has nothing to do the currency system from which it was stolen. Your logic is fail.

I'd choose a paper wallet for starters... you can easily make multiple copies for a rock solid backup. BitAddress.org is a good start. There are some measures you'll need to take to make sure the key information is no leaked. basically download the page, save it to a file. take your computer off-line (no internet access). open the page and reload it a bunch of times until you feel like you have some lucky bitcoin addresses/keys (lol) and then print them out. I would only print them to a printer via USB cable and only to a printer that prints directly with no internal storage. Print several copies and store them in a sealed envelope in multiple locations. 
now you can send money to those bitcoin addresses on the pages and they are nearly 100% safe from compromise. You just have to maintain good physical security on the paper now.
For online, discressionary spending, I'd shy away from using a mtgox wallet as it is a huge target for hacking/theft. I'd go with a phone/online wallet like blockchain.info but a standalone phone client is probably more secure - like bitcoin spinner or the andreas S android wallet. be careful with the andreas wallet as you cannot backup keys unless you root the phone IIRC.

Not an asshole at all! You're 100% correct. There's a lot of work and some risk for me to do this. Work as in time to coordinate with a seller and the WU agent, driving the cash to the office, and then turning the bitcoins into dollars to pay off my credit card, and take care to make sure the cash gets applied to the cash advance so I don't pay high interest - and risk that the price doesn't drop through the weeks time it would take to get my bitcoins back into cash to pay off the CC debt. Is it worth $100? It is to me, but in the end, that question is really only answerable by you/seller.

Turn on expert mode and increase your gap setting. This will make sure x number of unused addresses always exist.
Note: if you ever restore your wallet from seed, you'll need to remember that gap setting to get access to all your money.
Also, if you just spend money to one of the addresses, the client will automatically generate a new one, probably the next time you load it.
@_date: 2012-10-11 17:28:30
I dont think this will affect consumption, so I think we're about to see just how much "hoarding" is going on with miners. Are they saving their coin, or going straight to market with them?
If they are going straight to market, then a steady consumption will reflect the disparity between supply and demand and the price against the dollar will rise. If they are "hoarding" them, then the inflation supply coming in to fulfill consumption will probably not fluctuate much and the price will remain the same and/or continue its gradual rise due to network effect.

I do not agree with a refund address because of the potential for abuse/money laundering and administrative headache it might cost them.
However, I stand with you 100% that they need to block the acceptance of any funds if anything about the client connection or registration information is suspicious. They know what TOR and public proxy addresses look like, they know what temp email domains look like. If they detect anything like this at any point during the registration process, a big fat red X needs to appear all over the browser and reiterate their policy of KYC/AML. There needs to be a 1 or 2 sentence ELI5 TOS acknowledgement of this specific policy before any funds can be received.

IANA Lawyer, but I would be very surprised if there was not a precedent for ownership of anything of value - including digital goods, including bitcoins specifically or not.
Gox does NOT have a monopoly on the exchange business.. The have the largest volume because they provide, in general, a better service to more people allowing for better volume and stable prices. At anytime, people can freely choose to patronize any number of other exchanges to do their business.
Again, I personally believe that the exchanges need to go above and beyond when complying with any government at this stage in the game. Everyone should already be accustomed to the way it is with our financial institutions and exchanges are just another one of them now. If people are concerned about privacy, get in Bitcoin, wash your coins and forget about it. But do whatever it takes to allow the exchanges to function to keep the bitcoins flowing.

You could export the key from one wallet and import it into the main wallet and suffer no transaction fee loss.
Alternatively, you could check qt's preferences and make the transaction fee 0. It might take awhile for the transaction to clear, but it will happen.

it's all about diversity. Only keep a value at a service for the period of time you feel comfortable risking the complete loss.
I use InstaWallet to store up to $500 worth of coins for a 1-2 hour period while doing a face-to-face exchange. No problems with extending this kind of trust with them. I also use their service to store $1-2 worth of Bitcoins for several weeks while they are stored in Geocaches.

Miners bundle "unconfirmed" transactions into what is called a block. They must solve a cryptographic puzzle (hashing to a specific value) to "solve" the block. The block is links to all previous blocks in such a way that none can be tampered without exponentially increasing computing power. When a miner solves this hash puzzle, he is allowed pay himself all transaction fees and a transaction from nobody to his own address in the amount of the "block reward" - which is currently 50 bitcoins. The block reward gets cut in half every 210,000 blocks until the reward is zero. That's mining in a nutshell.
Bonus material: Inflation is controlled through the value they are trying to hash to... Every 2,000 blocks, the network agrees on a target that is based on the time it took to hash the previous 2000 blocks. If it was faster than an average of one block ever 10 minutes, the target gets more difficult. If the time to hash 2000 blocks was slower than an average of one block every 10 minutes, then the problem gets easier. Anyone trying to not play by the rules gets ignored by the rest.
Hashing to a target: basically, you can't know the outcome of the hash unless you compute it. So you take all the current "unconfirmed" transations floating in the memory pool, add the previous block  add a really really large nonce(random value) and you hash it all together. the difficulty is in guessing a hash that is less than 0000FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF (easy) or 0000000000000000FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF (hard). (essentially)

Ponzi scheme requires incomming money to pay off early adopters and falls apart when there are no more new comers. This is not the case with Bitcoin as it will continue to operate as a system to store and transfer value to another person - whether new people "buy in" or not.
It is the network effect of bitcoin that creates a demand for a limited resource that allows newcomers to make money, but only if they hoard their bitcoins and not use them as an actual currency.
Mining is essential to the security of the network, preventing double spends and inflating the currency into existence. Mining will *always* bare what the market demands. Too much computing power to mine and the difficulty goes up and not worth it... too little computing power to mine and the difficulty goes down and totally worth it. That it is inefficient probably goes more towards our shitty decisions regarding nuclear energy. A LFTR reactor would effectively dismantle any arguments against "wasting electricity on mining".

Once you spend the bitcoins to another address, you have plausible deniability that the funds are still under your control. The problem is, if you're trying to relay your plausibile deniability to law enforcement, you've already failed.
If you want to be as close to anonymous as possible, you need to operate a TOR hidden service and mix your coins. The effort and cost you put into mixing directly correlates to the loss of freedom you would experience if you get caught doing something illegal.

I've spent thousands of dollars in bitcoins over the last year. Most of that has been to friends that wanted bitcoins and didn't mind buying me the stuff I needed/wanted with their credit cards.
I use amazon wish lists extensively so when I want something, I put it on my list and ask people in my social networks to buy it for me. Depending on our relationship, I give them bitcoins right away, or wait until receipt of goods and negotiate what exchange rate to use.
I also have established a good network of local friends that enjoy swapping lunches,dinners,drinks  for bitcoin when we go out.
In all, I've paid for hotel rooms, office equipment/supplies, gun parts,  motorcycle parts, christmas gifts, graphic design, computers, domains... There really is no limit to what you can pay for with bitcoin - it's all about networking.

I appreciate where you're going with this, but Bitcoin anonymity goes WAY beyond using TOR... for each anonymous identity you maintain, you must maintain a separate wallet. When you spend bitcoins from a single wallet, "change" gets created when you call from an unequal input... this change gets spend back into your wallet. As you spend that "change", you're leaking transactions around different merchants and people that can provide identity information about you... to prevent this, you must fund identities with their own wallets. Electrum and MultiBit are perfect for this. Electrum even allows you to create signed transactions off-line, and injected into the network via tor hidden services.
Funding the addresses is a concern to because if somone can identify the funding source (you), you'll eventually get queried as to who you're paying (if you're a big enough target or have done something dumb and are about to get caught). so, you must wash your coins before funding those anonymous identity's wallets. If you spend your bitcoins to a shared wallet service, let them bake for awhile, when you withdraw them, you will not have the same bitcoins coming out. They will have been shared with other users of the system. This grants you "plausible deniability".. now you can fund the anonymous identity wallets with reasonable assurance of privacy. Next item up for discussion, keep your mouth shut if anyone of authority asks you anything about your transactions.

Gap limit determines how many addresses to pregenerate. It is an important number to remember, but I do not believe it is significant to recover the wallet. If it is incorrect, I believe there may be missing funds IF money was spend to those older sequenced addresses.
I just downloaded elec101c, created a wallet, recorded the seed, renamed the wallet, and successfully restored it from the seed. There does not appear to be any bugs.
To me, there are only two options: 1) you have the seed wrong, or 2) your specific seed is corrupt.

No, you're a horribly cheap person...  8D  .0005 for a transaction fee is pretty standard and equates to less than a penny and should be enough to get your transaction confirmed.
When you get more Bitcoin, you'll want to keep a savings "off-line", a smaller amount on an intermediary computer, such as one you do your normal banking from. This is where you bring bitcoins in from an exchange for example and then stuff them into savings or discressionary spending accounts on your phone.

You're right... but its effect is only indirect. At some point, X is "enough" in the mind of the people and additional computing power will not make it worth "more".
My point was, miners will come and go to the point that their cost of electricity is offset by the current or future value Bitcoin holds in their mind - and for some the altrustic price they are willing to pay on behalf of everyone to contribute cycles.
The more significant value comes from people's demand, the rate at which new bitcoins are being generated, and horded/circulated.

This would be the beginning of the end of an anonymous Bitcoin. The government would require you to pay your state ID fees with bitcoin as to register at least one with them that would then be allowed to sign one vote.

I'm up to date with those types of complaints. I dont believe that is gox's fault. I believe it's just a symptom of the f'd up fascism that's going on in america. If gox doesn't go above and beyond transparency with law enforcement efforts, they might suffer too much legal bullying from DAs and such and get shut down. The bitcoin community does not need this kind of attention at this point in the game.
My opinion is, get your money into Bitcoin as soon as possible, and then you'll never have to worry about this kind of BS invasion of privacy anymore. If you're concerned about the traceability of your bitcoins once you get them out of mtgox, there's plenty of ways to create plausible deniability of ownership afterwards.

It's structured like that to cause it to be the worlds first truly deflationary currency. The protocol is hard limited to 21 million bitcoins, and it is inevitable, and in fact already occurred, that people have lost access to their bitcoins so that they have forever been taken out of circulation (forgot their passphrases, failed hard drives, no backups, etc).
As to your other question, when you form a transaction, you put the public key of the recipient and your public key into a message and sign it with your private key and inject it into a live transaction network called the memory pool. A miner will soon come around and verify the signature and inputs of your transaction and bind it into the next block. Previous blocks are tied to the current through a hash. If you change any value in the block, the hash changes. Therefore, all the data is secured by linked hashes. If you change a transaction in an earlier confirmed block, you must recompute that block and every block on top of it - faster than the rest of the network can compute the next single block.

The same way Paypal brought digital payments to individuals (without having to use a credit card machine, etc), Bitcoin does. The only difference is that Bitcoin needs an exchange for most people because it is not ubiquitous. People can't spend their Bitcoins everywhere so most (merchants) need the exchanges (and bitcoin payment processors) to convert their BTC to a "usable" currency to pay their bills. Once everyone is on-board with BTC though, the need for exchanges almost goes out the window for most people - you'll be able to ask a merchant for change like you do when trying to break a benjamin.
I do agree with you that the blockchain needs more utility. There are so many possibilities with Bitcoin beyond just a method of value transfer. The talk of it being the new PGP and things like Smart Property and transaction scripts makes it such a powerful tool. The things that it will make possible in the future boggles my mind.

Blocks in the blockchain are batches of transactions that have happened in roughly a 10 minute period. When a miner solves the hashing problem, they get to include a transaction to themselves in the amount of the current reward. Effectively, the bitcoins come from nowhere to the miner's address. Fortunately, the rate at which this can happen is very regulated by the rest of the network.

@_date: 2012-11-30 03:59:52


Two very different things you're protecting against.


Bitcoin is fully anonymous. There is no mechanism in the bitcoin protocol to correlate real world identity and bitcoin keys. However, you make decisions (ignorantly, or purposefully) to reveal information about your identity to the people you're transacting. This information you leave behind is totally decentralized, meaning only those people have the information that relates you to that transaction. There is no central database for any authority to check and see who owns an address and ask them who they engaged with. If you're not leaving any identity information behind, or leaving false information about your identity. You're anonymous.
Now with that, there are pieces of relational information that do get left behind that can potentially assist an investigator to narrow down their searches for you. Bayesian logic is very good at inferring associations of data, especially data like the blockchain. The more transactions you make, the more potential there is to strengthen inferred data like social networks that can lead to loss of identity. But you have to understand that this is all decentralized information. In order for a merchant to give you up, they need to be found too. If they are using one address per transaction, the difficulty of identifying them gets harder and harder. If that merchant can't be identified, you're not going to get identified either. Additionally, it is very easy to break this link of relational data by simply exchanging all your bitcoins with a random stranger in meatspace. If someone comes calling about those transactions, you literally can't respond with who you traded with. Link broken.
To close out this topic, if you want to remain anonymous, here's what you need to do: maintain a bitcoin wallet for each identity you wish to keep and no not spend bitcoins between these wallets. Find a way to fund these wallets in a manner that breaks the associations between them - there are LOTS of ways to do this, use your imagination.
You're on the right track of doing offline wallets the right way. Just be cautious of your sources of software. I would recommend downloading the brainwallet.com or bitaddress.org pages to a file and burn them to a CD and only use them from that source from then on. I would use a client that lets you actually create bitcoin transactions offline. This generates a digitally signed message of your transaction that cannot be altered and doesn't reveal any private key information. Copy this text to a usb stick and ask any number of servers to process it into the memory pool for you. Electrum is F'ing awesome for this.

I'm not real sure on the usefulness of this. If you're easily identifiable in the real world, surely you're not anonymous on TOR. First, if your internet facing service and the hidden service are on the same box, confiscation and DoS by LE is a huge problem. Second, even if you do host them separately, any LE can look at your financials and see money going to a VPS or other hosting account and lead them to the hidden service. Even if you are using Bitcoin to pay for hosting, there are certainly information leaks (email, etc) that could lead an investigator to the hosting service.

Reformatting (and killing MBR) should be the first effort to clean an infected machine. Rootkits are software that hide their existence.

physical bitcoins and paper wallets effectively do the same thing.. you copy the cryptographic keys used to receive and spend bitcoins into physical meatspace.
the public key can be derived from the private key, so it is a bit redundant, but it is useful to have separately so that you can spend bitcoins to the offline addresses. This is effectively like safety deposit box with a mail slot opening.

I was practising this when I ran a online store last year. For me, it made sense because I was strong and long on bitcoin and had the cash and time to invest in product and wait for btc. This is not the case for most businesses.
However, most businesses that could accept bitcoin tend to think "I can't accept bitcoin because I need to pay my light bill and rent". The problem with that thinking is that Bitcoin is a few years off from that possibility. No significant numbers of people are going to crash down their door wanting to spend their Bitcoin for it to be a problem (for most businesses). I recommend they consider any sales in Bitcoin to be part of their savings and investment plan. it's not going to be much in the beginning, but it gives them the chance to slowly build their comfort, knowledge, and infrastructure for this new currency.

Sure it fluctuates up and down, but since it started, it's been generally in the right direction for me - up $10.46 overall. I'm in it for the long term because I believe in the cryptography and network effect from its beneficial properties. Another 10 years and enough people will have come to trust the protocol just as much as email so that it's ubiquitous.
No currency system has ever been created like bitcoin. Decentralization of transaction processing is the difference between it and everything else attempted. And so far, in it's 3.5 year existence, that protocol has never been hacked to mine bitcoins faster than the system permits, allowed money to be lost or stolen, or reversed a payment that someone has made and got confirmed. All thefts and hacks have been against unsecured services built on the protocol or misplaced trust in fraudulent companies and individuals. The money system itself is solid as a rock.

Currently, about 300 BTC per hour (but you'd have to be the only one doing it). when you mine, you do so competitively with everyone else mining. The more hashes per second you do, the better chance you have of earning inflation money and transaction fees. Search 'bitcoin hash calculator' to run your own numbers. But it's really going to be anyone's guess over the next 3 months. Expect total chaos (in the difficulty).

They get to use it too. However, "they" can also easily control most of the relays which gives them a good view of the network to perform timing attacks and better guess where traffic originates. Fortunately, this "they" does not refer to regular law enforcement and is generally not available to them. They'd rather keep their capabilities secret to catch bad guys doing things more nefarious than buying "medicine" on SR.
Also, simply running the TOR software is not enough to keep you safe. You must be keenly aware of how its possible for you to leak information about your identity and location. If you're doing anything other than using TOR to hide from a spouse or corporation, that might lead to the loss of your freedom, you better do a LOT of reading and get very technical or you will have a very bad day/life.
PGP is secure, but you have to question from whom and what kind of bleep you are on the radar of the people with the power to get around it. It is impossible to be secure/private from a nation state if they are on to you for terrorism or the likes thereof. There are mitigations for everything, it just depends on who you're hiding from and why.

Always set your buy rate to (a little) higher than the last trade. Shouldn't matter at that low volume, but if the last goes above your buy price, it stops buying.

bitcoin payment processors can immediately exchange at the point of sale into a currency the organization needs to pay its bills.

You absolutely need to maintain a separate wallet for silk road purchases... DO NOT FUND this wallet with anything you get from mtgox. The only real safe way to fund it is via face-to-face cash-for-bitcoin transactions. But you absolutely MUST maintain a separate wallet for this kind of thing.

Isn't this this the foundation for a double spend? being quicker to broadcast a message farther away on the network than your target?

Nope. It takes awhile. If 50% of the miners dropped off the network, it would take the remaining 50% of the miners to get through 2000 blocks before the difficulty would adjust down. This might take a VERY long time (because you have less computing power still trying to solve a difficult problem). And the target difficulty doesn't adjust to the new computing power - it's something like a square root so it takes about 8000 blocks to truly level out.
@_date: 2012-01-28 16:41:15
A smart hacker would check the transaction history of the compromised keys. If it's pretty active, money coming in, money going out, then you might consider watching the activity for large deposits. If it's inactive, chances are it's a change account and you won't see much more activity - so grab it now.

Network computing power has little to do with market price. Market price is a function of Supply and Demand. Supply will be ever decreasing - through individual fuck ups and decreases in inflation.

Very much so... if something came along that allowed someone to mine blocks 1000x more faster than anyone else, they would own the nextwork for 2000 blocks, but after that, they would again be limited by the 10 minute average because of the adjustment of the difficulty.

The security concern with doing this is that you have to trust the blockchain holder for your balance and to properly and timely hand off your transactions.
As mentioned already, there are numerous clients that do not require the blockchain and function as you described. It certainly does make adoption easier for newcomers - especially those in countries with bandwidth problems and older computers.

and that's kinda my point.. if you're "investing" in Bitcoin, shouldn't you be paying attention to all the innovations and ideas being thrown around as opposed to just wondering what service implements bad security and gets hacked?
The Bitcoin protocl has remained solid through all the hacks, exploits and misguided trust in service providers and continues to be defined by new ways to use and secure the currency. Im my mind, the massive bailouts were completely unfounded and hysterical.

Unfortunately for the courts, all my passphrases are all admissions to crimes. Also, I believe there must be known evidence of a crime before they can force you to reveal it... For instance, in the canada CP case, they saw CP while it was logged in and could then force him to provide it again. But if they are just on a hunt to find evidence, then they can go fuck themselves.

The best, most accurate answer you can get is by searching 'bitcoin hash calculator' and running the current hash numbers yourself against what your hash rate and electricity costs are.

This only lasts so long until they see it around for a long period of time and everyone else starts doing it.
This is why I think the best way to promote bitcoin is to pass knowledge from experienced bitcoiner to family, friends, coworkers, and neighbors - because they trust you, or at they feel they can kill you in your sleep if you rip them off.
This has got to be much more effective than any advertising, corporate sponsorship, stranger on the internet (blog, forum, etc).
@_date: 2012-08-30 11:35:43
Bitcoin keys come in pairs - a public key and a private key. The public key (a hash of the public key) is what is used to receive bitcoins. The private key is a secret used to cryptographically sign messages into the blockchain which states "I'm transferring value X to address z".
The wallet file simply holds these keys in a single place for ease of backup and encryption (if needed).
Additionally, the client uses the wallet to build a balance from all the public keys held.

split-key, a feature that might be available in the .6 qt client will require signatures from multiple keys before bitcoins can be spent. With this, you can require two accountants to sign a transaction, or one accountant and the CFO - just about any combination of required signatures can be designed but I heard that in the beginning, there will be just a couple of scenarios covered like 2-3 person combos.

dont get any large amounts until you are perfectly comfortable with storing bitcoins off-line. There are a lot of ways to do it, so do your research and practice it a LOT with small amounts... take it off-line, bring it back, rinse, repeat. especially if you're going to do anything tricky like encrypted qrcodes. when done properly, you can absolutely keep your bitcoins 100% secure. volatility... meh, over the next 5 years, it's a no brainer easy profit in my head, but I'm a bitcoin fanatic.

Yep, that's it. It's meant to create an urgency to figure it out since 25 other people somewhere might be trying to get it first. If they don't get to it, the bitcoin community (and they) still benefit to some degree by learning something about it during their research on redeeming it. yes, it will suck that they didn't get the bitcoins, but they at least made it to experimenting with some wallets and reading about it.
Last year, I gave out a dollar on each card and nobody attempted to redeem the bitcoins - addresses remained funded at least 30 days past halloween. So this year, I'm funding the wallets with $15 - an amount that should turn a lot more eyes and motivate them to pursue it.

You're on the right track. People reading about bitcoin on their own can easily be poisoned by media idiots who don't properly research the subject and chose a histerical style of authoring.
I believe the best way to promote bitcoin is through word of mouth - between mouths of people that trust each other. As a faithful bitoiner, you've done your research, you understand the technology, and you believe in it. Your social network has the most to gain from you because they trust your connection with them already. You, hopefully, have established yourself as a reasonable person who makes informed decisions in your lift. This has a high value for people when they are seeking or exposed to information.
They are much more likely to "try" bitcoin if you walk them through getting the client, asking them to get your beer or lunch this time around and hold some bitcoins for you "until next time"... use that opportunity to talk about the awesomeness that is bitcoin and let them see how well of a store and transfer of value that it is.
I usually get "it's just easier to use my credit card" type of comments and I counter with my lack of faith in our current currency, and how it's devalued and abused by those in power. and "I choose to use bitcoin because nobody can skirt the mathematical laws behind it and how fair it is to everyone participating" usually makes it easy to understand that it's more than a currency, but it's a protest too.
@_date: 2012-04-04 00:43:39

Have them deposit the Bitcoin into an account (address). Give them a challenge string to sign with the private key for that address. The challenge string should be something very specific like a timestamp, their account number/name, a purpose string, and some salt (random data). Example "2012-06-07 julian702 redditisland pledge fubarabuf"
You can see the balance in the address via the block chain. They can prove ownership of that balance via the digital signature (bitcoind signmessage/verifymessage). This is simply a pledge though... they could spend that money at any time.

here's how you explore bitcoin ownership:  See if you can figure out who owns that address 8D


That type of tracking is mostly only available to law enforcement. some infrances might be able to be made, but only if those peole that receive your bitcoins have well known addresses. In the case of law enforcement, it would involve a significant amount of foot work, prodding, and luck.
And then there's ways to wash your bitcoins so only one other random person in the world you traded with could identify you, but you never left any real identifying information with them either, so, trail broken.
@_date: 2012-07-23 11:41:17
This is a great point (about capital gains). Hoards of Bitcoiners are not going to beat down your doors and pay you in Bitcoin over night. The Bitcoins are going to trickle in. This means a business doesn't need to worry about "paying their electric bill" because of the flood of incoming bitconis. More likely, they will see a trickle here and there, which they could easily consider, and deal with, as a company's savings and investment plan. Save those Bitcoins, learn the things necessary to make acceptance of bitcoin easy and efficient, and watch their value grow over time from just sitting there waiting for the rest of the world to catch up to you!

As holders of Bitcoin, who have already gone through the education of learning how to obtain Bitcoins, all we need to do is start using our Bitcoin to spread them to others and simply replace them at current market prices. It can be done within a few hours now - especially if you're expecting a purchase. And if Bitcoin continues to perform, we shouldn't be sweating the increased value while we're refunding... we're already way ahead of the game. Spread the wealth.

I could argue that it's much easier to launder large quantities of bitcoin than it is to launder cash.
I think the argument to be made is that we have a right to privacy - including financial privacy. Why is it ok for the government to see how much money we have and where? Where is their probable cause to subpoena my data? I understand the government wants this information as a tool to track crime, but this type of intrusion sh/wouldn't stand in any other aspect of our lives. ("Show me your papers, citizen.

How is it unlikely that information of Bitcoin will not eventually spread to every corner of the world?

I believe things will balance themselves out... as deflation decreases, fees (or volume of transactions) will need to increase to create the financial incentive to mine.

Blockchain doesn't store your bitcoin keys in plaintext and doesn't know what your keys are. They store your bitcoins encrypted while the client processes/signs your transactions. There are some risks that their javascript could be compromised, but there are mitigations to that, such as a browser plugin that loads locally and verifies the javascript is correct. There is some risk, but its mostly mitigatable. I keep bitcoins in a variety of clients, but I was just recommending blockchain because it is the most easiest to used and most secure implementation of a 'web wallet'. Oh, also, the blockchain wallets are exportable/importable to QT and other clients so if they go down or out of service, you can still access your funds.
@_date: 2012-12-01 03:41:28
Example: 
Network isolation causes branching into A and B. Over time, branch A gets longer than branch B.
As miners in branch B work, and transactions gets confirmed into their version of the blockchain, the transactions are removed from the [memory pool]( and thus would not be rebroadcast to branch A miners upon reconvergence of the network.
The network reconverges...
All branch B miners are made aware of a longer chain and abandon work on their shorter chain and thus all transactions confirmed by branch B miners, from the start of the branch between A and B get lost/forgotten.
Unconfirmed transactions as seen by branch B miners (in their memory pool) get rebroadcast to branch A miners when the network reconverges.

My 7 billion people comment is not subjective at all. (Edit: except perhaps a hyperbolic 7 billion. In this case, you may insert any other large number you think is realistic)
* Fact: Bitcoin is a limited resource.
* Fact: Currently, relatively nobody even knows about Bitcoin. The community is small.
* Fact: Bitcoin has properties that make it very useful and desireable.
* Fact: Information spreads from a vacuum to knowledge and is almost impossible to stop as long as the information has value.
Ergo, As people learn of bitcoin, they will demand a piece of its limited resource which will cause an increase in value.
Proof: Bitcoin was nearly just as useful 3 years ago to the 100 garage hackers mining it. A value could be stored and sent anywhere. They were worth almost nothing - but it was a method of storage and transfer and it worked. More people learned of it and demanded it and believed it its usefulness. Today we have maybe 1,000,000 people believing in it and causing its value to equal $6.50. "Tomorrow", there may be 100 million people that have realized the utility of Bitcoin. What in the hell do you think will happen to the price? Is it possible in your mind that it could go down? If so, you are insane and/or not connected to reality.

mining is a competitive effort. your ability to make money is dependant on how many other miners there are trying to mine the same bitcoins. it's really difficult to gage because miners come and go from the network all the time. as more people start mining, the difficulty goes up. as they drop off, it gets easier. there are calculators to help you figure out your profit based on your hashing rate, electricity costs, etc. but again, it's highly subjective to what everyone else is doing.
as an example of the power of these new miners, GPU miners would do something like 800-900 megahashes per second. the smallest ASIC will do 4 gigahashes. midrange does 60 gigahashes. and the high end will do something like 1 terahash.

but there is no mechanism for you, as a miner recognizing the longer chain, to see the difference between what you're already aware of, and what some other group of miners see in their smaller chain. And when those miners give up on a shorter chain, there's no mechanism for the transactions from the branch up to be rebroadcast to the clients working the longer chain. Remember, there is no authority so your view is just as valid as anyone else's and your view of the network is your own, but due to network breaks, not necessarily the most accurate or agreed upon view.

The idea is that sites aren't hacked most of the time. So you "take your chances" and store the certificate on your first visit. At some point in the future if a site does get hacked, your app will detect the different fingerprint and warn you it has changed so you can investigate or avoid. This is how SSH works.

This is how Bitcoin is the world's first TRULY deflationary currency and we will, already, never see 21 million bitcoin in circulation. At some point, after a hundred years or so, we'll start to see the deflation kick in. The rate of production will be less than the rate of loss by people not taking good care of their keys. At that point, it will be a deflationary currency until the end of time.
Fortunately, Bitcoin is extensible and can be reconfigured to account for this in a fair way. They will simply extend the decimal place from 8 to something more and we will be able to maintain enough units of currency for a global market.

Not all of the bitcoins received by Bit-Pay were sold on a single exchange and I'd even go so far as to say a lot were sold outside of an exchange for this same reason.

Just use multibit or electrum to maintain wallets for each identity. For all intents and purposes, these wallets then act as separate identities and prevent "transaction change" from leaking identity information between these identities.
Transfer Bitcoins from your real-world wallet to your anonymous identity wallets through InstaWallet. Leave them there for several hours. When you remove the Bitcoins, they will have different addresses that what you put in. Do all this over TOR.

Before being an exchanger on localbitcoins.com, I was always chaffed, like you, by "middlemen taking their cut". But now that I've been doing it for awhile now, I see it as absolutely necessary to keep bitcoins moving. It costs me money to go meet people. It takes time out of my day. I have risk of loss holding $1000 in my savings account waiting for someone to come and sell me their bitcoins. I have risk of loss holding 100btc waiting for someone to come and buy them from me. You're giving me an incentive for that risk by offering me some profit to stuff my own money in a holding pattern while you come around to needing/wanting some of it.

My understanding is that only as good as their word, even if they put it in writing and can be retracted without any penalty - other than credibility the next time they want to offer it to someone.
The main point I'm trying to get across is "dont talk to the police" when being questioned about a crime and let your lawyer decide what you should respond to - or at least let him buffer the information. If you haven't seen the "dont talk to the police videos on YouTube, I highly recommend it.

 The money I'm investing is an acceptable risk compared to the potential gains.
 I disagree with your position that Bitcoins have zero probability of becoming a viable currency. It already is a viable currency as demonstrated by it's existence for several years now - and suffered through countless attacks and unrelated exchange hacks.
 The only reason it is high is due to supply and demand - speculators or not. Being that it is a depreciative currency, it is a pretty simple bet on speculation because after they are all generated, the number can only go down. (see supply and demand above)
 Goverment crack down on Bitcoin? For what? They are not illegal. As a matter of fact, correct me if I'm wrong, but as long as they are traded at less than $1k per day, they are perfectly legal and defined as "stored value" (can't remember the goverment entity that stated this). And as long as people report capital gains, trades over $1k are even legal as far as I know. So really, the only vunlerability here is people not reporting their earnings - which has it's own set of laws unrelated to Bitcoins.
 The government is pursuing the likes of Silkroad (or arguably, we should make drugs legal) - as they should. And it has not affected the price one bit.
 because of bitcoin's properties combining the best features of gold and cash, there is no reason Bitcoins can't be at the same (or higher) level of Gold - especially given the far higher limitation of Bitcoins that will ever be in existence.
Bitcoin is something the world has never seen before and I'm betting it's something that the new world order and globalization will demand.

I'm not an economist (or much of an entrepreneur) but to me, the biggest problem with the volatile market is people keep listing services in BTC. This needs to stop until the currency stabilizes. If you're in it for the transaction and ease of use, you want to get in and out of BTC as fast as possible. The buyer should know up front what this is going to cost him in his "native" currency and the seller should understand his BTC is probably going to appreciate (and offer some kind of discounted market rate).

To any browser plugin developer that wants to make a name for themselves...
We need a browser plugin that will look at specific locations in a URL for a Bitcoin address and allow you to send coins to it.
For example, if you're at  this plugin would look at /2011/10/, then /2011/, and then / for bitcoin.addr which would contain an address.
The plugin would show you a list of the addresses found and let you send bitcoins.
Perhaps it would even be able to scan a page and highlight addresses and do the same.
The idea being that people offering informative advice in blogs and forums would be able to be rewarded for their time. Thinking specifically about things like linuxquestions.org where people tirelessly answer troubleshooting questions and solve other's problems for free. It would be awesome to be easily able to send a helper (even) a couple of cents for giving me good advice.

Because the foundation of this currency is freedom of speech - your ability to digitally sign a piece of information. Given that the supreme court has already ruled that corporations can't be restricted on their ability to speak with their money, I dont see this happening.

When the site wants to authenticate you, it posts a random challenge string. You sign the string with your private key and post the signed challenge back. Then the site verifies your PGP signature against the public key you signed up with. Voila! You just signed in with no stored passwords or sensitive/reusable secrets and just strong crypto. Shit, you dont even need to provide a username because your account can be identified by its public key id.

Here's how you make money mining bitcoins (IMO).... Be an early adopter, mine/aquire bitcoins while they are cheap. wait. spend a little here and there to help the economy, Talk it up to your friends. when the market to hits $40+USD, retire.
Between July and December I mined about 1100 on my regular old workstations in my house. They were worth about $.06. Now I'm just trying to get more here and there by selling things I dont need anymore. I plan on keeping the bulk of mine for awhile because I truly believe in the possibilities of this new currency with global reach.
Another way to think about it... it may cost more money to make bitcoins than they are worth now.. but if this medium establishes itself as a globally accepted currency... it could very easily be worth MORE than current gold prices. easily. Especially if there's only going to be 21 million of them in circulation by the end of a couple years. Then how much would those bitcoins you paid $40 in electricity for be worth?

You know what? You got me. You're spot on for the first 6 months or so in the life of Bitcoin. But after that, when people started going semi-pro with GPUs, the game changed. I stopped "wasting my time" with mining because I couldn't compete and have always been disinterested in hardware. 
But the Bitcoin bug had already bit me and it was too late to try and get away. I made other investments in trying to make a small business that could earn Bitcoin. Kinda made a little profit, but soon realized that I'm more suited for learning as much as I can, full-time advocacy, and long term savings than entrepreneurship. I still run a bitcoin-only web cart and have my fun coming up with things to try and sell, like you said, mostly for fun.
So, anyway, while I agree early-early adopters didn't have much risk, the people who continued to mine post GPU certainly did. And since that guy dropped like $100k on some ASICs... fugget about it... Tell me that's not risk - but he's literally forging the future of Bitcoin with his own hands (along with every developer that continues to write lines of code for the infrastructure).

I'm a guy that just started selling Bitcoin Tshirts at  Here's a little insight to my philosophy (waiting to see how it works out).
Items are priced in what I feel is a fair price in USD. The card allows you to display the price in BTC which is calculated 3 times a day for the median exchange rate (high vs low) minus a 20% discount if you buy with BTC. Right now, if you buy my (AWESOME) tshirt with cash, it will cost you $15 (plus shipping). But if you buy it with BTC, it will only cost you $2.19 BTC.

Inflation is generally, but incorrectly, associated with the increased cost of goods and services. But this is a LIE/PROPAGANDA/INGNORANCE perpetrated by Keynesian economists.


Inflation is not the rise in prices, but the decrease in value of a currency against those goods and services - typically caused by the increase in supply of fiat dollars.


If you believe that inflation is the "excessive growth of the money supply", then you must also believe that deflation is the "excessive shrinking of the money supply".
Given wikipedia's bad definition of Inflation (your money buys you less as time goes on), it's understandable that their definition of deflation is off as well.

At a minimum they should use a self-signed cert for some level of guarantee it's not being sniffed.

You won't confuse the network by not deleting the old wallet file. But you may confuse yourself. When you spend money from wallet 'a', sometimes you're making change from a larger amount of bitcoins so that the amount you want to spend goes to the destination and the "change" gets sent back to yourself in at a new address. If you opened the copy of wallet on a different computer, it may not have that new address from the old wallet so you wouldn't see all the bitcoins available to you for spending.
@_date: 2011-11-29 18:13:22
The idea of "super-blocks" could remedy the problem. for instance, every 200k blocks, a summary of all the bitcoin addresses and their balances ever seen could be computed and processed just like the normal block chain. Then clients could decide to either process the entire normal blockchain, or start processing at any super-block they wanted and catch up to date with the normal blocks from that starting point.

Nope. They will make you base the value of the car, not the value of the BTC used to buy the car. It has to be reasonable or they will want to use a value from a reference similar to KBB. I bought a scooter under similar circumstances and either had to show a sales receipt in USD or they were going to use some outdated reference book and value it at some ridiculous rate. Ultimately, the tax the buyer is responsible for is based on the value of the vehicle - not any exchange rate of currency used to buy the vehicle.

There is an "alliance" for Bitcoin client/wallet developers to collaborate and implement new features and functions.

No, you're absolutely correct... but I see that as an extremely bad practice and only *slightly* safer than giving someone access your private keys.
The reason this is so freaking awesome to me is that it is now completely possible to maintain your wallet in a secure state off-line. Before, you had to take your wallet online to spend the money (risking someone being able to copy your private keys in the process. This is no longer the case, your keys can remain off-line all the time now.

@_date: 2011-12-29 00:24:13
I believe Bitcoin could become the Reserve Currency of the world BECAUSE it is deflationary... Save it and over time, people will cause attrition by doing stupid things with their Bitcoins: Forget passwords, not backup their computers, etc. This attrition causes the exact opposite effect of governments printing money as everyone else's value goes up through the decreased supply. (discounting the normal, expected, preprogrammed inflation).
Hoarding / spending will be the new speculation for holders as hoarding forever will make it useless and spending it eliminates future valuation profits.
People holding Bitcoin for its savings and online payment benefits would then need to get in and out of their local currencies based on their government's fiscal policies, tax obligations, and local purchasing needs.

I'll still use them for trading when I have more cash available. I dont have an account at TradeHill but I'll probably try both of them when it's time to buy.

It's not simply about one currency inflating or deflating against another. It's about the currency's usefulness. Right now, it's more useful for it to gain value by early adopters. There's an extremely limited number of coins and an increasing demand for them. Once people do start relaxing about bitcoin, the holders will see them less useful for gaining value and more useful for buying goods and services - and start spending them. Oh, and the world has never seen a deflationary currency. They might cut back on the printing, but they've always been able to start the presses up again. There is no way to "print" Bitcoins past the 21 million mark (in 140 years) and it is destined to be in decreasing supply as time goes on as Bitcoins will certainly be lost to attrition like failed hard drives, no backups, forgotten passwords, etc.

Spinner uses BCCAPI, which means a server is responsible for telling the client how much money it has, and processing your sends. You're trusting the server to not be evil..

I'm starting to sell things on bidding pond. One thing I'm uneasy about is listing things with a BTC price. The exchange rate has been fluctuating so much recently... Doesn't it make more sense to list things at a more known/stable currency and accept payment in BTC at the current exchange rate?
@_date: 2011-11-05 02:32:26
Absolutely. but it's unlikely the effects will be felt for decades (after inflation ceases). And the effects of user demand for coins has a much higher probability to affect the value compared to the small percentage of missing/lost bitcoins. That is, are there 7 billion people fighting over 21 million bitcoins? or is it still 100k-200k geeks arguing about their worth?

Lots of room to handle scalability at this early stage in the game. Besides, in the context of this idea, using Bitcoin as a long term store of wealth doesn't require any transactions at all. It just sits there until you have enough capital to do as planned.
Political challenge... yes. But here's the thing, even those individuals in power have a desire to maintain their own individual wealth over a long period of time. Not saying my point discounts yours, but its something to factor in.

Wow you really have no imagination.
Create several off-line addresses. Store equal amounts of bitcoins in each of the addresses. When you need to spend money, import one or more of the addresses until you have enough bitcoins for your needs.
Have a 1000 bitcoins you want to keep safe? put them in 10 wallets of 100 bitcoins each. Need 150 bitcoins for something? import two wallets. The rest stays secure.

I totally understand your concern for the instability in the currency... but it's still relatively new and unknown to the vast majority of the world...  in the time that it takes to inform them of the better properties of Bitcoin, and if the protocol has not been hacked in that time, then people will have a lot more confidence in the currency and it will rally again.

Use has nothing to do with inflation or deflation. Inflation/Deflation are results of issuing or destroying units of the currency. "Generating new Bitcoins" is inflation.
The Bitcoin currency will be inflated (into existence) over a period of ~140 years at a known, pre-programmed rate to a maximum of 21 million Bitcoins.
Bitcoin, overall, is a deflationary currency due to attrition and we'll never actually see 21 million bitcoins in circulation - we've already lost thousands due to lack of backups, failed hard drives, and forgotten passwords. Attrition (deflation) will only increase over time - and can be addressed by increased divisibility if it ever becomes a problem.
The divisibility beyond 8 decimal places is not inflation - it's more like "everyone turn in your 1 BTC and get 2 BTC back". It's a means of creating smaller denominations while maintaining everyone's relative wealth.

Your weakest point has just been solved by the advent of StrongCoin's offline transaction software.
Now your entire wallet can remain on an off-line computer, safe from malware, and still remain usable, spendable state. Stored it on a system using additional layers of encryption, such as truecrypt containers or full-disk encryption and I'd say you're pretty darn safe.

I think we're on the same page then.. I dont believe that deflation/inflation is the only variable to consider to calculate worth... but, IMO, it is a big one that we've all been trained to not see. Other variables can be intangibles such as trust and pure speculation - as well as the other more tangible conveniences such as divisibility, mobility, and acceptance.
BTW, inflation is not just a conspiracy of governments to charge stupid tax on it's citizens, but it's also a tool of war by other nation states. Check out "SuperDollar" for more information on that.

The idea is that you maintain extreme security of your wallet off-line so that nobody has the keys to sign off any money... 
From what I understand, when you create this transaction, it's basically spent money that nobody knows about. When you publish it, then it become fact for everyone else. Once the transaction is signed (offline) it can't be changed... it's a digital signature and all the to's and from's and amounts are sealed within it. It doesn't matter if anyone gets a copy of it at this point because they are suppose to in order to recognize the payment.

You're falling prey to sensationalism, which is actually a very human trait. Consider the vast amount of successful/honest transactions that do take place in relation to the number of bad ones. I dont know what it is, but I'd guess the ratio is probably pretty safe. I've made dozens of transactions, some as high as $5000 USD and none of them have gone bad except less than 1 BTC to the mybitcoin fiasco. And that was all my fault for not following through with a sale and transfering the payment out to my own wallet. 
Also, Pay some transaction fees and you won't have to wait an hour for confirmation. Miners decide for themselves which transactions to confirm based on the monetary incentive you offer.

Yes, I struggled with this one. I'd love to say it's "just as" anonymous, but it is not.
If I give $100 cash to a merchant for an item of value worth $75, the change of $25 in cash I get back has zero relationship to my original $100. There can be no association made between my initial purchase and how I spend the other $25.
If I give 100 bitcoins to a merchant for an item of value worth $75, the $25 I get back is derived from a split of the transactions that made up the $100 in the first place. This means that an association **can** be made between my two purchases.

Early adopters had their own set of risks... investments in hardware, operating costs in electricity, application of knowledge and skill. Bitcoin functions just fine as a medium for transferring wealth in cooperative commerce. 
Additionally, you can do awesome amazing things with this currency like send it to people the government doesn't want you to, back it up, require multiple signatures to spend it, and run conditional, autonomous scripts with each transaction to do things like escrow, good-faith/security deposits, and deathswitch/inheritance payments.

Unless you're willing to drop tens of thousands of USD on video cards, the only way anyone is going to get bitcoins is through selling stuff. This can either be done by selling used items on classified ads or auction sites, selling a service, or as an existing merchant accepting them as payment. If you already have bitcoin, go ahead and keep them until the market is more stable and seems prudent to spend them - BUT, feel free to buy more as you need to spend. This will help increase the BTC value AND let others get into the economy by providing their own goods and services.

Anything to get Bitcoins into the hands of non-techies will help the movement. Once they have them, they'll figure out a way to use them and propagate them further into the general economy. Offer them Bitcoins for covering you at the bar, or lunch at work. Anything. Even if they dont know what to do with them, you can buy them back the next day when it's "your turn".

You can be completely anonymous with Bitcoin but you need to follow some rules. Basically, a wallet for each identity to prevent "change" from being spent in other transactions. Read more here: [BitcoinIntro.com](

Consider this: you can generate a bitcoin address completely off-line on a computer that has never been connected to the internet and have bitcoins sent to that address. The only way to spend those bitcoins would be to import the keys for that address to an on-line computer. It's because the transactions are public knowledge and distributed to all the miners/clients for confirmation. The keys only need to be present/online for sending.

The URL on the flier (with tear offs) will direct them to [my walk-thru tutorial]( on how to retrieve the bitcoins.
**If anyone would like to hand some of these out in your areas, let me know and I'll send you a template PDF that you can then print your own keys.**

I dont think it's a interest they are earning... but a discounted fee at withdraw. I can't figure out what the discount is based on. Perhaps the more merchant transfers you make inside their system, the less it will cost you to take your bitcoins out of their system? but that doesn't really make any sense.
The cold storage is the only way to be 99.99999% safe with Bitcoins, but unless you're doing it yourself, you're increasing your liability by trusting their employees and security methods.

If these mass holders are smart, they are distributing at least some of their wealth to build infrastructure, reward developers through payments in bitcoin, or otherwise promoting Bitcoin. Hording them ALL for themselves does not help their value over time. So do what you can get get as many of them as you can while they are "cheap"... you make money as a second level early adopter and help promote the currency... Trickle down economics kinda do work in a truly free market.

I teach it to a lot of people - who ever is interested in it at the time. I've done it for friends, coworkers, etc. They get it how to use it, but it doesn't stick over time - mostly because they don't use it after that. The problem seems (after I bring it up later) is they can't grasp the notion that the information they have is  worth anything and  there are, at minimum, several hundred people that have access to their information (when you consider isp employees at every hop of transmission or IT workers at their jobs, etc). I've seen people straight up talk about illegal drug use and other criminal offenses in their messages. Most people just have no concept of privacy in the digital realm.
@_date: 2011-12-13 01:20:24
a paper wallet is simply the cryptographic keys used to receive/send Bitcoins printed on paper rather than residing in your wallet.dat file.
Go to bitaddress.org and create some. If you send bitcoins to the bitcoin address generated, then you can "import" the private key into something like strongcoin.com or mtgox.com (free) and spend the Bitcoins.
The purpose is so you can keep your bitcoins off-line and safe from malware  and certain forms of theft. What's awesome about this is that you can literally backup your money by photocopying the keys/paper and storing it in different locations. Use encryption (like mixing up the numbers) to make it resilient to physical theft too.

I'm super excited about Bitcoin too! IMO, the best way to promote bitcoin is to let as many people you know personally know that you already actively participate in the economy.

Talk about purchases/trade's you've made and talk up the points about zero taxation and usage fees.

Online wallets are a great way for new users to quickly see how Bitcoin works and instantly begin to use it... The locally installed clients are very difficult for people in 3rd world countries to run because of their limited resources.

Why couldn't you put encrypted bitcoin private keys on a magstrip/smartcard and use the pinpad to decrypt the keys when you need to spend the money?

 I'm sure he doesn't care if it's unethical. It being unethical is pretty obvious.
 who cares, it's not his electricity and he's already demonstrated his unethicality
 (not a windows guy) but I'm pretty sure you dont need admin access to run the software if the binary is in your profile directory and especially if he put the startup shortcut in the local user's startup directory (rather than the system startup folder).
The only problem is that it's highly likely that a sysadmin would find it due to the CPU being bogged down all the time and possibly software audits. And lets not forget the fact that the wallet would be public access. Anyone could send the bitcoins to their own wallet *IF* the computer was lucky enough to find some.
The guy would certainly be subject to some kind of federal (or even local) hacking laws if caught.

Just a little semantics... you're only generating Bitcoins the instant you guess the right hash and the network confirms it. Otherwise, you're mining. The client will allow you to mine, but unless you're doing it with specialized mining software and GPUs, you're not likely to generate any Bitcoin because of the difficulty level and competition.
The other options you have are purchasing them through an exchange or offering a good or service for them (best option for the community).

Bitcoin is NOT overvalued... How many people even know about Bitcoin? 100k? How many people know and use paypal? Probably a helluva lot more than the Bitcoin user base. I'm going to guess 1 million. If those 1 million paypal users wanted to use a free payment service over paypal and all of the sudden wanted a piece of the bitcoin pie to do their transactions... you can bet the value of BTC would continue to rise. Now, extend that to the other 7 billion people on the planet... currently 6.5 million bitcoins spread across 7 billion people... the fight for bitcoin hasn't even begun.

Sure you can use the addresses (and private key data) generated by a bitcoin client... but that information will forever be vulnerable to malicious software that can copy the data to an attacker and spend your coins away. Even if your client uses encryption, it's vulnerable to key logger attacks.
By generating your keys off-line on a pristine computer system, you're avoiding these pitfalls - the keys are safe from malware and can be printed to pdf and stored in a safe physical location.

From what I understand, the Bitcoin forks are the same thing except different inflation properties which is not enough incentive for mass adoption. There very well could be an alternative chain that takes over.
Honestly, I don't see what people are complaining about early adopters.. Even someone buying in right now would be an early adopter. A 10k investment would currently net almost 5k bitcoins. If the world adopts bitcoin in 15-20 years and they get even half way to the value of gold, you'd have a nice multi-million dollar retirement plan. And if you think I'm crazy for thinking BTC could ever get that high... Remember, when BTC hit $30, how many people actually knew about them? What happens when the next phase of interest reaches the 7 billion people on the planet? I think it is easy to think BTC could go that high. It just all depends on the protocol being compromised and wide-spread dissemination of how BTC is better than fiat currencies and commodities.
Go ahead and say I'm crazy, but at least I'm putting my money where my mouth is.

I'm ok with a delay in a rally. My faith in Bitcoin is as strong as it ever was, but development has a long way to go before mass adoption. It's happening, but we're just not there yet.

Speculation buy/sells are no different that any other purchase - you're just buying another currency instead of a "good" or service. There might be some serious problems with BDD though... like, how the clients decide to choose inputs. If it only chooses new inputs over old ones, then it becomes a function of the percentage of bitcoins people spend. The only way to destroy old bitcoins is to spend all your bitcoins to move them. It might still work if it chooses old inputs first.

The client will break down the user and domain name and form a standardized url domain/bitcoin.id/username and perform a get of that url. if an address comes back, it will use it in a bitcoin transaction.
Example: my email is tuxavant
Username = tuxavant
Domain = tuxavant.com
URL = 
(get the URL)
Address = 1TUx7o2FKVfhjko3gNmB3zwVuNdxfHcer
With a deterministic wallet serving up those addresses, it would be easy to dish out a unique address for each request. Using a seedless wallet would prevent the keys from being hacked.

Electrum does a much better job of letting you securely manage your keys offline. There's no need to potentially compromise your keys by swapping infectable media between online/offline computers.
Create an offline electrum wallet using a large number as a gap (pre-made keys). Use a brainwallet for extra nerd points.
Deseed the wallet and transport the master_public_key to the online computer. It's a long number but can easily be transferred via qrcode or typing.
When you transfer this master public key into your online computer, it will update balances for your addresses, but the wallet will not be able to spend any money.
Distribute your bitcoins to the addresses.
When you need to spend some bitcoins, grab an address from your deseeded wallet with the appropriate balance you need. From your offline wallet, export just that private key for that address - again transferring it via QRcode or typing it.
Now import that private key into an online wallet for spending. 
By doing this, you're not compromising your entire private keyring when you need to spend or using infectable media to transfer balances or key data around.

I am going to predict a crash in the mining/ASIC market. If the exchange rate doesn't rise and the difficulty continues to go parabolic, no one will find it equitable to mine past a difficulty of 80 million. Only those with free power will do so.

It totally depends on the miners who mine them. If they want/need USD for those bitcoins, then dumping them in an exchange is an option. But there are many other options too like holding them, using a non exchange like localbitcoins.com, or being "responsible" and slowly cashing them out instead of one giant pile of shit in the market.
Also, the increase any ASIC miner will get will only last for about 8k blocks and then the network stabalizes on the new hash rate as production gradually resumes to 1 block per 10 minutes.

Mike Caldwell, the casascius guy, inadvertently created a pretty good 2 party escrow system using his address utility. Both parties create a confirmation code that is used to produce a public key. Each "burns" bitcoins to the address that have no private keys and can be verified. Then each user reveals the secret used to craft the confirmation code and the other party can spend those burnt coins. I'm sure I got some of that wrong, but that's the jist of it. So with that, you can meet random people in irc and anonymously exchange 1:1.

Bitcoin backed notes don't have to have private keys necessarily... people just have to have faith that those reserve notes can be redeemed for the bitcoin value. This is exactly how bank notes backed with gold worked 80 years ago. yes you will still have problems with counterfeiting and fractional reserves - but that is how things worked for a long time. And perhaps it would be possible to make federal reserve notes with private keys like casascius coins...

Have you ever heard of a seedless, deterministic wallet? It allows a wallet to generate every bitcoin key it will ever need based on a large integer/passphrase hash. The seedless part comes from the fact that this seed (that generates all future bitcoin keys) can be removed from the wallet, yet still be able to generate the public keys.
So with that, you can generate and deseed a wallet on an an off-line computer, move the deseeded wallet to any online computer and it can receive payments and show you as such. This is how the electrum client works.
Now with acceptbit, you have a web/mobile interface for the same thing. Go anywhere, be anyone, and accept payments on behalf of some secure, offline wallet, from any device. Ridiculously innovative. Game changer because of the implications to bitcoin payment processor services.

with electrum, the wallets can literally be stored in your brain. It is trivial to sync it across multiple computers. And it is even trivial to make 'seedless' copies of that wallet on multiple computers so that none of them can actually spend your bitcoins - It's a read-only style wallet.

Stratum servers a nothing more than a modified bitcoind. I run several of these on my tor exits. My electrum client only connects to servers under my control. So, zero trust.

The difficulty and the currenty network hash rate.
If the difficulty is high, that means miners must guess a hash value with a large amount of leading zeros.  This difficulty only adjusts ever 2016 blocks. If the hash rate goes down because it's not profitable to mine, then it takes longer probability to guess those hashes with a lot of leading zeros - and you have to do 2016 of them before the difficulty gets recalculated. Normally, this recalculation takes 2 weeks (works out to 1 block per 10 minutes), but if a hash rate starved network, it could take a month (or more, or less) depending on what's going on.

Two rules a miner must follow to process the blockchain that limit bitcoin monetary units:
1) every 2016 blocks, look back 2016 blocks and check the timestamp. If it's more or less than 2 weeks, adjust the difficulty target acordingly. This controls the rate of block creation.
2) every 210,000 blocks reduce the block reward value by half. this limits the amount of bitcoins that can ever be created because eventually the reward value equals zero.

Not sure I follow, but when a double spend is attempted, one of them will go through and get confirmed (provided they are both seemingly valid transactions on their own merit). There is a chance for either one to get confirmed (your "cheat" spend, or the actual bet you are trying to cheat). It's not necessarily an equal chance because the likelihood is increased with network connectivity and hashing power being applied.

You can't trust a dual boot disk. If the "offline" system has any ability to write your keys anywhere that can be accessed by the online side, you're doomed.
Example: You build your offline computer with a infected version of software xyz. When you boot, it eventually identifies something that resembles a bitcoin key and writes it to the online partition. Then you boot the online partition, running the same xyz software that picks up the data and sends it off.
Any offline computer needs to be considered a data diode where information is treated like a black hole/roach motel. Data can only go in and never get out under any circumstances.

that is correct. By everyone doing the same calculation of the same data in the blockchain, they come to a consensus of that the new difficulty should be. It's like we both read a billboard that has the numbers 2 + 2 and I tell you the result is 4, you can confirm it for yourself and come up with the same number.
The calculation miners do is just a rule defined in the software. 
Honest miners ignore the fraudulent/bad data generated by evil miners. As long as the majority of miners are good, they have consensus and reach the same calculation/result.

You're not looking at the right fundamentals.
Bitcoin has extreme scarcity of 10.9 million bitcoins right now and a user base under 1 million (safe bet IMO). Lots of turmoil in traditional banking systems is causing a huge increase in awareness of the new system.
If bitcoin remains a solid system to store wealth, it will be thousands of dollars per bitcoin. Especially as it starts to take fractions of global markets as a medium of exchange. - Right now, it's less that a billion dollar market capitalization.

I'm sure it is inevitable that some large group like this will cause an actual Bitcoin fork at the development or mining level. That is, some future hard-forking event will occur and will not be resolved due to inability to get unanimous consensus on the "correct" solution.

No it doesn't. Everything has risks and potential for better performance. People want to make more money and pursue their passions. If savings stop performing, then they will invest it in the things they love.

If you use BitPay, their exchange to dollars is instant at the point of sale. The actual time to receive the dollars is then dependant on the ACH transfer times of the traditional banking system.

You could commit a relatively large amount of bitcoin to a merchant into an escrowed transaction ahead of time. Now you use some external protocol that is more efficient at high frequency transactions to accumulate debt against the bitcoin transaction. This is a completely different accounting system the merchant runs, or perhaps an altcoin currency. Then, when service is terminated, the escrow is settled and terminated with the customer credited any unused bitcoin value.

it does.. so if your view of reality is that fork, and some one comes along and tells you of a longer, more reliable reality that does not happen to include that transaction, the transaction no longer appears confirmed (or perhaps less confirmations). 
The thing that confuses most people is that reality can easily and instantly change as your peers learn and tell you of other realities that are more established than what you currently see... this is the product of a decentralized network with no central authority to dictate what reality is.

Two mitigating factors I think need to be discussed are the option to use a 2nd pin to spend and the relative vulnerability of this preference file between rooted and non-rooted phones. It's my (plausibly misinformed) understanding that a rooted phone doesn't sandbox apps and thus this file would be at more risk to malicious apps - but not so much on a non-rooted phone. I would like to hear more about his from someone who is knowledgable.

I totally agree that there are selfishness acts that are perceived as good or bad. But the argument is that we are all selfish because the we will never choose to engage in a transaction where we don't come out ahead by some tangible or intangible measure.

You need to go back and study LTC a little more. You're missing some critical information on this specific topic.
The reason more blocks are required is because the blocks happen faster - 4x faster than bitcoin. So it's a wash and requires the same amount of time for equal confidence. In other words, four blocks of LTC can disappear just as easily as 1 block in BTC due to network convergence.

False. Look at available metrics like increases in favorable news, client downloads, registrations, and subscribers to centric forums like &gt; The natural price of Bitcoin is far, far lower than where it stands right now, probably around the same level it was last summer, after its first catastrophic crash and before its second.
False. Growing user population and their growing demand is exceeding restricted supply.


False. The blocksize is a scarce resource too. This means as it becomes more popular and used more, competition for space in the block will demand higher profits, via fees, for the miners.

This all day long for many things regarding bitcoin. Except, that we're all staring at a free market floating exchange. We all understand supply/demand very well and the market price is a direct reflection of this. There might be a lot of people again interested in bitcoin, buying it up. When that desire subsides, the price will stabalize. Merchants returning bitcoins to the market to pay for their inventory or light bill can reduce that. etc.
But I'm more in line with bitcoin has a lot farther to go in terms of relative price to other currencies because of the small community it is at the moment and its scarcity.

The purpose of "backing" implies a useless thing like a piece of paper can be redeemed for something valuable. The motivation for this was gold was heavy and not very divisible. Reserve notes were created by banks as a promise that the paper could be redeemed for the gold.
Since bitcoins are very convenient in that they are weightless and very divisible, there is no need for any backing.
The only real utility for backing bitcoin is for its use as an offline currency - bitbills. Perhaps a government could mint coins in the fashion like Casascius and get a little more trust behind it and really allow them to be used as an offline, redeemable currency.

Bitcoin is a ledger of transactions. Whe you receive 1 bitcoin, you're receiving a spendable value as if someone wrote $1.00 USD into a traditional ledger.

There are things about bitcoin you can't possibly understand at this point in your life. You just haven't been exposed to enough finance, politics, technology, cryptography, game theory, etc to understand the unbelievable innovation and security there is in bitcoin.
It's not your fault, it is just where you are in life. You have the ability to understand what's going on here, but you need to dig into all of these things and you will understand why we feel it's a safe bet.

Fees help make that first confirmation happen faster as it provides an incentive for a miner to include it in their block. After that first confirmation, it confirms incrementally just as fast as every new block.

It is possible, but not probable. And even if it does happen, it's more likely that the collision will happen past hundreds of generations of human lives. In a thousand years, someone *might* generate a keypair that has a history in the blockchain, but the value previously stored there would have long been spent and the original owner's keys lost/forgotten past any usefulness.

The miner can run off an android device if you wanted - no significant computing power required. Basically plugin your ASIC to your USB port, fire up your mining software and let it rip. The app on your computer connects to the internet, listens for transactions, and passes data to the ASIC for hashing. Correct hashes are identified by the app and then blocks are broadcast back out to the internet peers.

@_date: 2013-07-13 13:47:41
I can't tell from your comments, but you should be clear in the understanding that a bitcoin is not a token that gets passed around. It is a value that gets input and output between different accounts.
When you have 50 bitcoins and spend some, it's just a value that gets assigned to another account.
"how many coins are being traded over X days" can be [viewed here]( This is the total output volume over time.
"And how many are actual in circulation and being used in some manner rather than hoarded." is almost impossible to calculate because the total transaction volume could be comprised of a single person sending a few satoshi between their own accounts over and over. It is impossible to tell the difference between internal account management spends and spends for goods and services.
However, the "Bitcoin Days Destroyed" is our best indicator of hoarding vs spending - but it still faces the impossible distinction between economically worthless spends to self and economically healthy spends for goods and services.

There are 2.1 quadrillion units in bitcoin as each bitcoin is divisible to 100,000,000 decimal places. There are indeed enough monetary units to support a global economy.
We are already getting accustomed to high value bitcoins and names for smaller units. Just today, I spent 29.5 mbits on a margarita at lunch. Perhaps in a few years, I'll only have to spend 29.5 ubits.
@_date: 2013-08-07 23:28:03

You can get apple stocks for like $450 at your broker of choice. You can get Bitcoins right now for about $20. The difference is that bitcoin very well could be worth thousands in 10-15 years. I think people misunderstand that early adopters in regard to bitcoin still have another 15 years to join that club. And even for those unfortuante people that are unable to ride that ship, they will still benefit from the world's first monetarily deflating currency and be able to make use of its never before seen properties like brain wallets and instant global zero fee transactions.

Merchants should want bitcoin for the same reasons we want them. they tend to appreciate over time, your customers actually pay any transaction fees, there's no special equipment to buy/maintain, shit, you can even securely use your employee's phone to receive bitcoins on your behalf. Because bitcoins go directly to you, there is zero risk of employee embezzlement. You never have to worry about chargeback fraud ever again. You don't have to comply with PCI requirements with regard to Bitcoins, so you save thousands of dollars a year on compliance requirements/reporting. You're able to painlessly receive payments from a global market.

unconfirmed transactions are different from missing bitcoins. The unconfirmed will eventually happen. It might take days, but it is unlikely that they won't eventually confirm.
The client might be reporting the funds unavailable while they are confirming, but again, this usually shows up as a balance in parens next to your available balance. example 100.00 BTC (2.95 BTC)   - sorry its not exact, I haven't seen the qt client in awhile.
If your transactions are straight up not there, then it's likely the wallet you're using doesn't have the keys generated from a change transaction.
@_date: 2013-02-07 18:18:57
All the stuff you're asking about is currently doable, but it's highly technical. Multikey transactions require multiple people to sign a transaction for it to be valid, and an external tool called Shamir's Secret Sharing Scheme (SSSS) can be used to distribute a person's private key across multiple people, like a lawyer, next of kin, employer, etc so that n-of-m pieces of the secret are required to rebuild the original secret.
Eventually, these tools will be enhanced and integrated in a grandma-proof software tool and everyone will have access to these ridiculously powerful and awesome features.

You must first understand hashing. Hashing requires an arbitrary length input of data, and outputs a fixed length, pseudo random output. For any given input, the output is always the same, but to know what the output will be, before doing the hashing, is impossible.
Miners are taking transactional data, a link to previous "page in the accounting ledger" and a random number called a 'nonce' and hashing it. The result is a very long number (fixed length, pseudo random output). If this number is less that whatever the current "difficulty target" is, then the problem is consider solved. If not, they change the nonce and try again.
You can play around with the function of hashing with this online utility: 
Experiment with different, similar inputs and pay attention to the resulting output for full effect. Bonus points if you can find an input that results in a hash with two leading zeros (this is my difficulty target for you).

You guys are misunderstanding what "backing" means the problem it is intended to solve.
Fiat currency is "backed" by a hard asset like gold to instill faith that it can be redeemed for the hard asset.
"Back in the day", gold and silver was heavy and not divisible so banks would issue "reserve notes" backed by a quantity of the precious metal because they were easier to transport and use. If at any time you wanted your PMs, you could take the reserve note into the bank and get it.
Once banks realized they could print more reserve notes than they had PMs on hand, shit got real and the theft began.
Bitcoin does not need a backing, because it is very much like a hard asset. It cannot be reproduced at will and it is scarce, it is perfectly divisible into useable quantity, and it is extrememly portable.
@_date: 2013-01-02 15:42:17
It's a permissions thing. When you spend money to another address, you're effectively specifying what *private key* has the right to spend that money. That is, only that public key's private key can write the next transfer. The blockchain doesn't need to know anything about that private key. Only a signature from the private key, that corresponds to the public key that has authority over that input is allowed to spend it next.

I think its a great idea. I did this with my kid's 4th grade class and a presentation and workshop at defconkids last year. It was well received.
You can print out a batch of bit bills preloaded with a small amount of bitcoins. ask them to come up with goods and services they can provide and set aside some time for everyone to manufacture, create, and barter. In the mean time, have workshops that teach how to make brain wallets, bit bills, initiate transfers, and explore services like short urls and online wallets like easywallet.org and blockchain.info

Also: One of the things I did was like an egg hunt and left bitcoins in various formats around the workshops. Sometimes the keys were encrypted or encoded, sometimes they were just URLs/clues/etc. If they found them/figured out the puzzle, they got to keep the bitcoins.

Consider it safe to accept zero transactions for a couple dollars value. And 6 confirmations for buying a house. Everything else goes in between based on your trust of the person you're dealing with and personal level of acceptable risk.

Longer blocks in the context of a single alt-coin always means more security as more work is required to remove a transaction. All the blocks from the time of your transaction must be confirmed faster than the rest of the network can confirm one more block.
Longer blocks in the context of multiple alt-coins is relative and needs to compare the relative ease of confirming those blocks.
Basically what happens is miners working on faster alt-chains create blocks faster than network propagation allows for miners in slower networks to hear about those chains... so soft forks happen until convergence notifies mining groups of longer blockchains... when they finally hear of a longer blockchain from one of their peers, they have to abandon the shorter blockchain they have been working on - to a merchant peering with that shorter blockchain, it appears that the transaction has disappeared (if the longer blockchain has not yet heard of the transaction to that miner and included it in a block).

Since it would be easy to see who's mining blocks with no transactions (an attack to deny service of the blockchain), those nodes would simply be blacklisted and ignored.

The government was worried they would not have the resources to crack the encryption zimmerman was making available to the public. The figured out it would be a lot easier to get at the data while it was unencrypted than trying to brute force it.

To understand the origins of FRB you need to remind yourself of what "backing" means. A long time ago, we used gold as a currency. It was  heavy to carry around. So we let banks hold our gold and trusted them to issue reserve notesthat were redeemable for the gold on store 1-for-1. The notes were "backed" by gold.
Then we were taken off the gold standard and the reserve notes did not actually redeem anything and therefore were not backed by anything. The banks could effectively print notes at will.
Implying that Bitcoin can become a monetary unit in a fractional reserve banking is somewhat true, but it is 100% unecessary because bitcoin does not require any "backing". It is perfectly convenient and easily storable and transmittable in its own form. A new fractional reserver currency could be build and backed by bitcoin, but why? - and note it would be a new currency ontop of bitcoin, not making bitcoin FRB. The only benefit I can it is serving is to allow its use offline. But you're opening yourself up to central banking fraud by giving them the opportunity to print "reserve notes" not backed by actual units of bitcoin currency.

@_date: 2013-06-14 23:27:27
Increasing the confirmation time means that network latencies will allow for soft forks in the blockchain.. that is, there will always be networks out of sync with what is "the longest blockchain". When those slow networks do find out about the longest blockchain, the confirmations their network is aware of will disappear... the quicker you make the confirmation times, the longer these forks can get - and disappear. 
Effectively, the shorter the block confirmation time, the more blocks you need to witness for the same level of confidence they won't go away. 10 minutes is the best middle ground.

It's easy math. Pick any global market that bitcoin has a reasonable chance to take a piece of (remittance, for example: Western Union pushed 80 billion in global payments last year). Now pick a percentage of the market you think it could take of that market. Lets say 10 percent. That's 8 billion dollars. divide by 10.8 million monetary units of bitcoin. Thats over $700 per bitcoin to equal that single market. It's not the most accurate way of doing it because that money is used in other markets before and after the transfer, but you get the idea. the ridiculous scarcity of bitcoin requires that each one be worth thousands of dollars if it is successful in capturing fractions of these markets.
But be wary... a problem could surface in the next 5 minutes that renders it completely worthless and planes fall out of skys and kill people too... bottom line is, it will either be worth thousands+ or zero. Not much in between over the long haul.

It's trivial to argue, and prove plausibilty, that you cannot remember the password.

My friend, "Balldacious", is a pretty devout anarchist and is very frustrated with payment processors. They've finally pushed him over the edge and he's committed to only accepting Bitcoin on his site by the end of the year - you would not believe the regulation and personal information they are requiring of him to process his payments. So I'm trying to get some guys to develop AcceptBit.com into a real solution for self-processing bitcoin payments. If you want to build something that will change the world, I feel this is the project that will help do it. I've got one developer starting to look at is and putting in a few hours during a mini sunday hackathon, and another has said he can put some time into it in a few weeks. If you think its something you'd like to participate in, PM me and I'll get you in touch with the guys to collaborate.

Did you keep the last wallet file before you "restored" ? wallet.dat files can lose keys if you dont back them up regularly. (~100 transactions) If you restored an older wallet.dat over a newer one, you may have destroyed some addresses that contained bitcoins from "change" transactions. 
your best course of action is to restore that wallet file you overwrote and let your blockchain sync before doing anything else.
If you do not have a restore of that wallet.dat you overwrote, then you probably will not be having a good day.

You're not understanding the threats of relying on a stratum server. All you're risking is improper balance reporting and that the node will successfully relay your signed transaction to the network (it either passes it on, or it doesn't, it can't be tampered with, and is easily verified by another source). Don't trust a stratum server for any reason? Pick another one, or run one yourself. It's literally no different that running bitcoind on your workstation.
Considering all the complaints that new users have about running/maintaining bitcoind, using electrum and someone else's statum server is a very valid, reasonable, and secure alternative. You're extending negligible trust to them for providing a service and you don't ever have to worry about an unsyn'd blockchain.

As for filling up the block with your own transactions, they could still be easily identified as the likely higher priority of other transactions in the memory pool would be ignored.

Separate computer is the safest. Disable all networkable interfaces either physically or logically in the bios: ethernet, wireless, bluetooth, IR. In full paranoia mode like this, the only safe way to transmit data is via webcam and qr code (so its possible to verify the data being transmitted over the air gap).
The main idea here is that once your key data goes into this container, it can never escape under any means: portable drives, network interfaces, etc.
Short of this, and you might as well just use an unnetworked VM and copy un/signed transaction data back and forth.

Transaction speed is just fine for bitcoin when you put some things in perspective.
1) The confirmation time of credit cards and paypal is up to 6 months. Even cash has a 24 hour confirmation time while you wait for your cash deposit to clear the next day and the teller determines all the bills are not counterfeit.
2) Just as it is unlikely that someone will counterfeit a $10 bill, it's unlikely that someone will attempt a $10 double spend.
3) Litecoin's 2.5 confirmation time is diluted due to network convergience and generally require 3-4 more confirmations to bitcoin's 6 for full confidence.
The only thing litecoin has going for it is the alternate proof of work system - and even that has dubious value.

point 1) your address doesn't necessarily change, you just get more of them. You can receive money to a specific one all the time, but as you spend from it, "change" (can) go to a new address. This helps with anonymity.
point 2) All day long with no worry of "collisions"
Q 1) like in point 1, yes, most wallets do this. But since all those addresses are maintained in your wallet, it's all still "your money". You shouldn't get too hung up on this and just let the wallet manage your balances.
Q2) yes, you can even receive bitcoins to "change" address, which may or may not make a bad day for a financial forensic analyst.
Q3) yup.

But the immediate threat would be slow confirmation times. If new transactions outpaced the ability of the network to process those transactions... that would be bad bad bad.

One of the problems with TOR is the random domain names like "3suaolltfj2xjksb.onion". With namecoin, you still get to run your anonymously hosted server at that address, but you get a nice human friendly name resolution like HiddenWiki.bit that resolves to that onion address.
On top of that, HiddenWiki.bit cannot be seized or redirected by any government. It will always resolve to the hidden service at 3suaolltfj2xjksb.onion. I don't quite understand how renewals work though or how to replace onion domain keys if they are compromised.
But that's the jist of it.. it's a irreversible name resolution service. It doesn't aid any compromise of anonymity.

The oracle. transactions are just scripts that return true or false that make them valid or not. It lets you do things like have transactions confirm in the future, or simply confirmable based on valid signatures. the idea of an oracle is a "trusted" centralized server that returns part of the variable to be checked in a script.
an example of this is documented in the discussion of smart contracts - the one of inheritance... a inheritance payout is validated when an oracle service says "person X is deceased". Until then, the transaction is not valid and the amount is not spendable.

People lead the value of bitcoin ahead of inflation drops. When it was $5, people thought they had already accounted for the increased scarcity. By the time the halving actually occurred, it was past $10. I suspect the same thing will happen as we get closer to the next halving.
TLDR; prices increases to account for scarcity and miners keep their heads above water.

That's all true, that there's untold amounts of precious metals and gems "out there" waiting to be harvested... but there's the problem of getting them back here to use.
Also, my take on it is that gold and silver and well established and everyone knows how they perform and an expectation of what they are worth. The difference for bitcoin is the potential they have in our existing global economy. Fractions of bitcoin adoption in any/all of our global markets, and their extreme scarcity, REQUIRES that they be worth thousands of dollars. There is no way around this simple math (do it yourself, its easy). The potential valuation is simply ridiculous. 
Why invest in gold/silver/etc, with its static value, when there's Bitcoin and it's ridiculous potential for increase value?

Altcoins aren't something you can simply generate, exchange, and use in a global market. Infrastructure needs to be build to support each individual currency. Not just wallets, but networks of peers, services, storage and bandwidth, etc.  Bitcoin faced these very issues, and still does today. Any Altcoin is going to face a gigantic wall of resistance for lack of network effect. There simply are no benefits for doubling the efforts of building that altcoin specific infrastructure. Bitcoin is far to extensible to not be able to adopt changes and new features introduced by other systems. (edited for clarity)

In a way... Network speed/latency is pretty much the reason for bitcoin's 10 minute confirmation time.
For example, you could find a block and broadcast it, but if it didn't propagate out of your peers faster than some other speedy network, your block could be orphaned and all the work you did erased. But it only really affects you in close calls or lucky rapid blocks.

We will reach that kind of stability when many more than 2-3 milllion people know about and use bitcoin. There is just too volatility from massive spurts of interest in a short amount of time. Stability like you want will happen, but only when bitcoin users reach like 500 million people or more. Until then, its going to be a bumpy road. IMO.

Not so sure about that. Think about all the development that has been done to build up Bitcoin: exchanges, cart plugins, point of sale systems, wallets. All of that will have to be redone for a new cryptocurrency. It's been hard enough to get companies to build their systems to accept bitcoin and change their financial process for Bitcoin. Because bitcoin is so extensible, any new cryptocurrency would have to have some truly amazing benefits that bitcoin could not conform to for it to take off and become accepted along side Bitcoin.

Bitcoin is a protocol. Everyone participating speaks the same language and everything about the blockchain is 100% transparent. If you do something invalid or against the protocol, it's is trivially verified and ignored. So, no. Edit: World class hackers have been pounding their heads against this since 2009 and not once has this process been compromised by hacking. There are vulnerabilities such as a Finney attack, but no computing network has the horse power to pull it off.

Short answer: no.
Only keep online what you can afford to lose under any circumstance. You would not keep the value of your paycheck in dollars in your phsycal wallet because you can get jacked or leave it some place. So you should not keep a similar value in your online wallets.

Actually, it can go up infinitely... The reason is, Bitcoin is monetarily deflationary, and there is no sign that the governments will ever stop printing fiat. All fiats will incure inflation. Stack that against an ever decreasing supply of bitcoins, and you can safely bet the value will always go up.
@_date: 2013-03-29 01:37:28
The dollars you were printing to buy bitcoins dont "all go into bitcoin". They go into people's pockets who give up the bitcoin and will then spend them. Those additional dollars flooding into circulation devalue the dollars already there by increased supply. It is the same for the 65 billion a month bernanke prints. It's called inflation.

Making a superstrong passphrase can be a daunting task, it's not impossible. IIRC, a longer single set is stronger than a shorter multi-set string, in general. For instance, 'mynameisjjjjuuullliiiaaann' is better than 'myNameIsJulian'. dont use dictionary words - misspell things, perhaps use phonetically similar sounds like 'mynaymeisjulianne'. tokenize your passphrase like DOB or '1900-01-01 or use datapoints of your life that only you know about - perhaps list keywords of events in chronological order like 'birth there's a zillion ideas to help make easily rememberable pasphrases that are impossible to crack.

Gold is not a deflationary currency. We mine it out of the ground all the time.
Once bitcoin reaches 2.1 quadrillion satoshi, it ceases. Large sums of bitcoin have already been irrecoverably lost to misfortune and ignorance by not backing up keys, which means the world will never see 2.1 quadrillion usable satoshi. As people keep fucking up and "burning" their bitcoins, their scarcity only increases over time. THAT is (monetary) deflation - and we've never seen anything like it in human history.

Each bitcoin is divisible to 100,000,000 satoshi.
This currently allows for 2.1 quadrillion monetary units.
This is expandable by a software change (which would result in a hard fork).
@ $100/btc, a single US penny is worth 10,000 satoshi. And the total market cap is 1.1 billion (US).
For a single US penny to be equal to a satoshi, the exchange rate would need to be one million dollars per BTC.
If bitcoin completely replaced US M0 ($6 trillion), each bitcoin would be worth $600,000 each. An a single satoshi would be valued less than a penny.

You can post an address on GGB, but you've lost your anonymity because you published an address you claim as your own under your account. This also lets all your competition know how much you make ([LadyBytes](
As long as she maintains the private keys for this public bitcoin address, she can receive spendable bitcoins to it for all eternity. Or she can create/publish a new address thousands of times a day. If one were intent on hiding their earnings, they would have to create one new address for each transaction. However, If they then moved all individual transactions into a 'central account', we'd be able to see that (as a donor) and make the same determination. But this would really only be available to the people who received a donation address and made a donation.
For example... I followed one of the transactions in the address above to an apparent accumulation account containing [5.79 bitcoins]( But it's really a lot of guesswork. A deeper analysis might either show it's someone else's money now, or just a smaller piece of her entire holdings.

I'm not arguing that. I'm saying that 210,000 blocks works out to be "about" 4 years due to the average block time of 1 block per 10 minutes.
1 block per ten minutes is 6 per hour. 6 per hour times 24 is 144 blocks per day. 144 blocks per day times 365 days per year is 52,560 blocks per year. 52,560 blocks per year times for is 210,240 blocks.
Additionally, due to the increases in difficulty, the blocks on average get solved faster than once every 10 minutes, so the halvings will usually occur slightly quicker than the protocol's plan for "about once every four years".
But yes, the hard number for halving is 210,000 blocks.

Bitcoin is absolutely anonymous. Show me where it stores your real world identity in the blockchain. It's not bitcoin's fault you don't know how to break the link when you spend your bitcoins. The fact that you can absolutely be anonymous in some situations (with no extra work), such as paying for downloadable media where you don't need to specify any PII, proves it. All other transactions, you're making a conscious or ignorant decision to give up PII that reduces your anonymity - all of which is outside of the blockchain and bitcoin protocol.
Besides, the section clearly has the word pseudo next to it.

It's a new address for each transaction, but it's not a burden on the receiver because each of the addresses is already "in" the wallet and spendable just by spending it. No importing keys, etc.

You can never be too paraoid, IMO. But you should keep it in check with reality so you dont end up being a crazy. 
You have to weigh the cost/benefits of everything to make the best decisions.
If you use smaller wallets, it will take a long time to withdraw the bitcoins if you need them in an emergency. But if you don't need those bitcoins for 10 years, you may only need a small amount.
If you use a large wallet and dont need it for 10 years when they are *really* worth a lot, then you're risking bringing a very expensive key "online" to spend some a small portion of it.
The risk of a randomly generated key collision is extremely unlikely. The risk of a brainwallet collision is much more likely.

There are a couple things going on here... First, the old school miners with tons of bitcoins have an extremely high potential to disrupt the relatively small value moving in the exchanges. Stability will come from these super rich as they "cash out" their holdings to new users and spread those bitcoins to thousands of new users and create a new "floor" from which those new people will not want to go below.
Also, as the market cap rises, there will be more value available for taking on more commerce around the globe at the same time.

With that, it doesn't matter to me *too much* because my only risk is to other manufacturer devices that raise the difficulty before I get in (again).
As for the "loss" I've taken... It's inconsequential to me because the device creates bitcoins. The 240 bitcoins I paid for the device will be returned to me at whatever the market price will be and I should get the 240 bitcoins back IF they don't release any magic smoke before then.

Clearly, you do not understand the implications of bitcoin. By accepting bitcoin, you can now accept payments from countries that traditional payment processors will not touch with a 10 foot pole due to the fraud in those countries. Then there's the increased competitive pricing made available by cheap transaction fees.


So all 5000+ BitPay merchants are selling illegal goods? You're a moron and a troll.


Bitcoins cease to be created in 2140. Hundreds of thousands of bitcoins have already been lost due to attrition as people lose their keys, failed hard drives, no backups, etc. This attrition will continue throughout the life of Bitcoin.
Deflationary spiral is a myth. The randomness of individual's life urgencies guarantee that bitcoins will always flow. Sure people save for as long as they can, but they also know they can't take it with them when the die - and when they do, their heirs will be hungry to spend them to increase their level of living. And then there's food, emergencies, and life events that require spending like marriage, college, a place to live, etc.

If there is one thing that bitcoin will do, is force moral merchants. Nobody will trust sending bitcoins to a merchant with a bad reputation.
The purpose merchants love recurring payments is because it is a form of extra revenue by forgetful people and often even put up barriers for people to cancel recurring payments so that the revenue stream continues. This is immoral.
Bitcoin is a push transaction, so it it is impossible. The only way to do it is to prepay. This is not a good idea with a deflationary currency such as bitcoin because you'd have to prepay a year of service, and miss out on the increase valuation of your currency during the year.

If it's more global, then there will be significant problems with all types of transactions.

You do if the passphrase contains an admission of guilt for some crime. Also, it is possible to have plausible deniability in knowledge of keys. For example, a large part of the complexity of a passphrase is stored on a yubikey style device. When entering your password to decrypt your wallet, you type in a simple word, then press the yubikiey to add the rest of the complexity to the password. You never have to remember this complex part. If the yubikey ever gets destroyed or becomes lost, there is no other way to recover the wallet because you never did memorize those 30 random characters - you just pressed the yubikey and it did it for you.

If they want to use the money, they will have to somehow import that private key (long number that starts with '5') into a wallet. There are no clear instructions on how to do this or that it is even an important number (especially to keep private). The instructions to import the bitcoin key into a wallet varies depending on what client they choose to use. Blockchain.info is the easiest to use and very safe for discretionary spending, but there are some setup steps that should be done to make it robust. Add to that the actual importing instructions and basic usage, it starts to get kinda difficult.

Not entirely correct. You can spend a partial amount of bitcoins at an address - in whole amounts of an input to that address - you can have multiple unspent inputs into an address that add to the total spendable account.

Thank you for addressing the commission with your concerns.


The commission is very aware of Bitcoin and have been studying it with great intrigue. To date, we have been unable to adequately manage our currency system and may be looking to Bitcoin in the near future to help solve our budgetary issues, by it removing politics and influence from central bankers from the equation.
Legally, we have found that none of the laws we have written to combat drug use have been successful and therefore will soon be removing the burdensome laws from our books. Studies indicate that education, rather than incarceration leads to a better informed and healthy public and also increases individual freedom.


This is a great point. Since the beginnings of government, we have held a monopoly of force over its people and forced them to pay their debt to society at the end of our guns. Going forward, we will be establishing bitcoin addresses for all public services and let each individual voluntarily contribute to those public services they feel are necessary and warranted by their state. We feel this will not only encourage competitve efficiencies of our government agencies, but also remove that threat of force from our good and decent citizens and allow everyone to fell much more content and patriotic in their nationalism.

Electrum can be used as a very safe offline wallet... but, to truly hold the title of an offline wallet, it must be one you never allow to communicate with other devices after your keys have been generated. At this point, you used webcams and qr codes to move un/signed transactions back and forth.
For discretionary spending amounts, I am comfortable using bitaddress.org to generate keys and print ou the QR codes (pub/priv) to paper, laminate it, and keep it in my physical wallet. Then use mycelium to sweep money from the paper wallet into the mobile device as needed. This way, the "slightly higher value" keys are only stored on the phone long enough to top off the online keys and then deleted (which is ok, because you have a laminated backup in your physical wallet!)

Negatron. There are many innovative ways to encode data into the bitcoin blockchain.
As a simple example, create a vanity address never seen before and spend satoshis to this address where the amount equals a byte of the data you're encoding - encoding a space character means 32 (ascii char for a space) satoshi, etc.
The data you encode is a passphrase to a brain wallet, or actual private keys. All you need to do is remember the vanity address you spent to so you know where to find the data.

No I didn't. 
Armory needs a lot of resources to maintain a copy of the blockchain so that it can report proper balance information for spending - You can run your own stratum server and connect electrum to it if you're that paranoid, but the vunerabilities are easily mitigated. The vulnerability of using someone else's stratum server is that they will report incorrect balance information/outputs to spend from AND/OR they can refuse to forward your off-line-signed transaction into the network.
Big deal. If a "evil" stratum server gives you bad outputs, you sign it and nothing happens because the signature is useless. If they give you bad inputs (like spending to the wrong address), this is trivially detectable in the offline signing process. If the "evil" stratum server refuses to forward your signed transaction, you just connect to another stratum server.

They said it has ponzi qualities due to early adopter advantage but even this is incorrect as any new company offering stock has an early adopter advantage but did not go as far as to call it a ponzi. There is no promise of return in bitcoin nor managers to take your money and give you dividends, so sorry to bust your bubble, but Bitcoin is not a ponzi, fuck you very much.

M2 = $4,625/BTC

I had prepared a resignation letter, which was actually just some scratch random text on a page from a printout. Trifolded and sitting on the edge of my desk. I was waiting for my boss to get off a conference call, so it just sat there. He eventually got off the phone and wondered into my office and commented on the $100 per bitcoin event... I said "Yea, about that. Can you close the door for a few minutes?" and he got *that look* on his face. I picked up the folded paper on my desk and started to hand it to him.. He was like "NONONONO I don't accept this!". "My wife and I talked it over and its what we need to do right now. We're retiring". And he sat down to read the letter. A look of confusion came over his face as he tried to make sense of the completely unrelated words on the paper. "What the hell is this?" he asked... to which I replied "More importantly, what day is today?"
Oh, he was fucking pissed BAHAHWHWAHWAHHWHWHAHAAA.

Everything's value is comparable to something else. We compare bitcoin to dollars and euro because they are well known values and stores of purchasing power.
Bitcoin's value doesn't depend on dollars, it's only a relative reference. When it started, 6 pennies would get you a whole bitcoin. Today, 1 bitcoin will get you 100 dollars. Due to scarcity and demand, 1 bitcoin might get you 1 million dollars some distant time in the future. The dollar doesn't get ousted, its relative value just goes down.

Not so. Bitcoins are constantly taking out of circulation, never to be replace, due to failed hard drives, no backups, forgotten passwords... this increases scarcity.

What risk? You can choose to exchange received bitcoins into dollars immediately at the point of sale. There is no volatility risk if you choose there not to be. Your accountant will probably love you for only giving him dollars anyway.
The way I see it, there is no downside other than development time to implement it into your payment system. Think of all those new patrons, free advertising, and reduced payment processing fees.

Not everyone gets to analyse your transactions. If you're only required to show ID to the merchant for KYC, then only the merchant knows you spent to an address and can make a correlation. If the merchant gets served a subpoena, then LE gets to know too. This is no different than how it works today. 
If you're saying the addresses you use must be registered with the government, then the government *should* only be able to investigate your spending with probable cause investigating a crime. This is not public information and is how things work today.

I speak for myself but I think you'll find that the general consensus if you ask around.
The benefits of running bitcoin-qt are strong if you're holding a lot of money in bitcoin because trust is everything. With bitcoin-qt, you're validating the blockchain from beginning to end all by yourself. With this come resource utilization: lots of disk thrashing and time while you build your blockchain. And everytime you shut it down, you'll be spending more time thrashing to catch up with the rest of the network.
To new person who doesn't aways understand the necessity/purpose of the blockchain, and just wants to send/receive bitcoins, this causes lots of agony and further confusion. So given that, it's usually easier for a new person to learn to swim faster by using a client/interface that seems more intuitive and feels more responsive.

Counterfeit bills detected by the bank upon deposit can be confiscated with no recourse for the merchant. Chargebacks in traditional payment networks can happen up to 6 months later. That's quite different from an hour for 6 confirmations and 100% irreversibility.

bitcoins are created by people running mining software. This software validates other people's transactions and links them to previous blocks of transactions. In doing so, they get to create their own transaction which awards them the right to spend an amount in future blocks. these bitcoins come from nowhere - almost like a transaction that says "from nobody, to you, in the amount of x bitcoins". This reward value has a half life of 210,000 blocks (or about 4 years). Each 210,000 blocks, the reward gets cut in half until the reward equals zero. The reward started at 50 bitcoins and will end with zero around the year 2140.
Solving these blocks happens randomly and competitively - that is, the more efficient and powerful hardware you can throw at it, the more likely you are to create these blocks of transactions. Additionally, there is a feedback loop in the protocol that directly controls the rate at which blocks are created. Add more computing power to the network, blocks get solved quicker, and the problem is made more difficult to slow down the rate. Remove computing power from the network and blocks take longer to solve, the problem is made easier, and the rate increases.

Because of the built in scarcity of bitcoin, the relative number of people on the earth that even know about bitcoin, and the likelihood that they will eventually find out and want some of that scarce commodity indicates that the upward trend will continue long term. 
Also helping that notion is the fact that bitcoins are monetarily deflationary - after 21 million are created, we'll never really get to 21 million in circulation because people destroyed their bitcoins, lost passwords, didn't have backups, etc - they continually become more scarce.
Even if demand stabalized throughout society - scarcity will always increase because people die with their brainwallets and don't share their keys with next of kin, computers fail with no backups, etc.

Nope. There is nothing that represents a unique Bitcoin in any way. There is no atomic unit of any bitcoin, not even a satoshi. A value of bitcoin is a an "input" that gets divided into outputs at each transaction. Any "number" of bitcoins is the summation of inputs coming into your addresses.

Worry much about your private keys, yes. Paranoia should be strong for this, good. 
If anyone gets this data, they can spend your bitcoins. Don't let people use your devices that contain your bitcoin keys. If you must, make sure they are only stored in encrypted containers - and even then, a keylogger can get them what they need. Shoulder surfer=bad. Again, paranoia is good.


I don't want to give away what we're looking for to prevent fraud, but yea, that's fine.


If you dont have a bank account, you're going to have to result to localbitcoins.com and find locals willing to buy them for cash.

Yes, the exchange rate is based on supply vs demand - and the difficulty is based on cost of mining vs profitability of mining. 
If the difficulty is ridiculously high, that means miners are getting smaller income for the effort they are putting in and affects their profitability. If the exchange rate rises, then there is more reason to mine again.

Bitcoin as a protocol, which is all it is, functioned perfectly through the exchange madness. Even Gold is exposed to massive market fluctuations by large holders dumping. By the way, look at how fast it can value - and its still way way way up above what it was a month ago.

It still comes down to an individual's perception. Any benefit someone else gets out of a transaction with me is inconsequential because if I didn't find any value in it, whether it was a tangible value or not, then I would no pursue it. Similarly, if the other party didn't find value in it, they would not go through with it. If they get some value out of me benefiting, then they are getting value greater than what ever their part was in the transaction. Feelings, happiness, guilt, etc all count towards values you have. That's what I've been trying to formulate into words for the post above that posed the question about giving one's life.

You are correct that developers could toss in some code to do this, but I would guess that version of software would be summarily dismissed by the community and anyone one adopting it would fork off into their own little unsupported network like most.
Most of us want scarcity because it creates value. The currency inflation model creates stability because we know exactly how many bitcoins come into existence until 2140. With your rule, there's no way for the market to judge when new coins might start to be created again... it could be that 70% of all current bitcoins were abandoned by people who lost hope and in 140 years they start getting created again would cause disruption - or not.
And it's a slippery slope... If that rule can be created, then why not just create a rule that the reward value is always 50 btc and inflates for ever? Fuck all that.

You browsed the Internet (and encountered malware). It is the equivalent to walking around a mall with a wallet so full of cash, a pickpocket passing by can see the bulge on your butt, and swipe your wallet from you. This is why you only keep the majority of your bitcoins in an offline wallet or dedicated computer for finances/banking.
The only thing you can do now is rebuild your operating system from scratch - you can't trust any software on it at this point. Rootkits intercept legitimate (AV) software's requests to detect the malware. The only way to be 100% sure you're not infected with malware is for a complete "wipe the drive" reinstall of your operating system.

If I can qualify my answer, I'll go ahead and say "with near certainty" a single bitcoin will be worth a million dollars (or more).
Qualification: No time limit and bitcoin does not encounter a catastrophic event. That is, it will either work for as a global currency for a century or it will not.
Reasoning: The USD will continue to monetarily inflate over time. Bitcoins will deflate eventually. An increasing supply of USD against a decreasing supply of BTC means an ever increasing exchange rate in Bitcoin's favor.

Yes it does. If you have a seedless wallet GUI, the send transaction screen will allow you to write the unsigned transaction to a file. In the seeded wallet GUI, you **import** the unsigned transaction and it will prompt to sign it and save to another file. Open the seedless wallet GUI and import the signed transaction and it will prompt to send the transaction to the network.

Cryptocurrency is a new asset class with high risk and potentially a (ridiculous) high return. Bitcoin is the most prominent of all the cryptocurrencies.
If nothing else, invest in educating yourself - Get $20 worth of bitcoins and learn how to use it securely. Experiment and have fun with it. You'll learn many many other things along the way. When/if you're done, go buy something with the $20 you learned with - or buy more. Your choice.

Only a small fraction of bitcoins are available at any of the couple dozen exchanges. If someone was to quickly buy up what is there, people on the upperends who didn't get bought up would reposition themselves higher and raise the attention of others who could immediately push their offline bitcoins into the market at those higher rates - but not everyone would. For example, I spend my bitcoins in the economy every day, but my mass exodus exchange sell price doesn't even exist. If bitcoin gets to be that valuable, I won't need to "cash out", I'll just spend them.

All the yubikey does is type stuff as a HID device. There's nothing preventing you from adding your own keystrokes or using backspaces to take some away.
Lets say your short code is "X58-%"   - keeping it short for demo purposes.
This yubikey short code is your "have something".
Your "know something" is some additive keystrokes.
When prompted for your seed, you manually type in "marvborg", then hit your short key, and backspace twice, and then manually type in "rocks!"
Your seed in this example works out to be "marvborgX58rocks!".
Even if someone finds the yubikey, they have to know you removed some keys. For some additional craziness, use your arrow keys instead of backspaces.  Lets say instead of backspace twice, you use left arrow twice. Your seed becomes "marvborgX58rocks!-%"
Now, make your short key press the maximum 33 characters of random shit, and you have a pretty good system.

Any exchange market has an order book of buyers and sellers. Each person lists their qty and amount they are willing to part with. The exchange matches up those buyers and sellers. There may be only thousands of dollars or bitcoins on either side of the buy/sell order book. But what is unseen is  everyone holding cash and bitcoins not in the exchange and  everyone holding cash and bitcoins in the exchange but not listing an order. So if I've got 10000 BTC sitting in my exchange account, with no order, nobody can tell it's there. But in an instant, I can create an order and put all 10k btc anywhere in the order book I like. That is, sell btc at $50 or $0.01. But when I do, the system will immediately try and match me up with someone. If the last order was at $16 and there are cheaper and cheaper btc buy orders at say 100 1 6 15 8 etc... and I drop my BTC in a sell order  then my order will get matched with all orders over $14 until my 10k volume is spent. Basically, buy and sell orders will chew up all volume on the other side if priced right.

Also, the timing was specifically chosen to avoid orphan blocks that are the result of latencies in the network and transmission of transactions and new blocks. Litecoin's "easy" 2.5 minute confirmations are 4x easier to create that bitcoin blocks and have an increased likelihood they can "disappear" as network convergence occurs. For this, you actually have to wait for about 4 times as many litecoin confirmations to bitcoin's one for the same level of confidence.
@_date: 2013-02-12 20:46:51
gold came out of thin air too, so to speak... billions of years of star fussion coming together.
The point about gold, and bitcoin, is that they are significantly difficult to produce. To produce gold would require a large amount of energy to mash together to create more. If you spend the equivalent energy to create bitcoins faster, the network would actually prevent this from happening faster than planned and the protocol would not let you create bitcoins past 21 million either.

The length of time has to do with network latency, block propagation, and soft forking. Too quick and you'd have a lot of fork flopping going on. This is why LiteCoin's 2 minute confirmations suck balls and force you to wait for more confirmations for the same amount of confidence for Bitcoin blocks.

You should become more informed. When you buy firearms online, they don't ship them to your house unless you're a federally licensed dealer. The merchant you're buying them from ships them to a FFL in your area, where you then go in to pick it up. Before you can pick it up, you must pass a federal background check. 
It simply is not the case that you can (legally) buy a firearm online and have it shipped to you.

Clients all over the world are generating unconfirmed transactions and broadcasting them to other nodes. This space is called the "memory pool"... the miners pick and choose these transactions, based on TX priority and fees, to include in this data block.
Basically all the components of a block are:
 Last block height/hash
 new transactional data
 miner gets to insert one single transaction to himself in the amount of the reward value. This is where inflation money/reward comes from - from nobody, to miner in the amout of reward value.
 a 'nonce' which is basically a random number. This is what the miner changes at each hash attempt to get the hash to change in order to attempt to produce the leading zeros.

Fractional Reserve Banking is the process of allowing banks to not keep 100% of customer desposits on account for immediate withdraw. This is incompatible with bitcoin because each person maintains their own balance of bitcoin in their own wallets - there is no need for a bank.
Additionally, federal reserve notes initially were receipts for precious metal deposits at the bank. You deposit gold/silver, you got a reserve note that meant you could take that note in and withdraw gold/silver. Again, this is totally incompatible with bitcoin and unecessary. The piece of bitcoin that allows you to spend your value is a binary code. The scam with a fractional  reserve system is that the banks can easily print more notes that represent the gold on hand. There is no need to deposit it anywhere or have a reserve on hand to redeem it.

Electrum allows for completely secure offline transactions over an airgapped network. No blockchain to maintain. No infectible media - just QR codes and a webcam on either side.
 create your wallet on the offline computer
 export your master public key and send it to the online side via qr code.
 sync your "seedless" wallet on the online side.
 Create a raw, unsigned transaction, encode it to QR code, and transmit it to the offline computer.
 Sign the transaction on the offline computer with your private keys
 encode the signed transaction into a QR code and send it back to the online computer
 send the TX to a stratum server.

The fatal flaw for blacklisting is the time it takes to get a ruling and the number of times a bitcoin can be spend during that time.
I can imagine a large number of pissed off people that received fractions of outputs through legitimate transactions, thousands of transactions later, after some authority says the outputs from a year ago are now blacklisted and the outputs are worthless.

Electrum and deterministic wallets.
Each electrum wallet's addresses are determined from a single seed. This makes it easy to backup and provides you with ever bitcoin address you'll ever need.
To make it ridiculously secure, you can further separate public keys from private keys so that your front end servers do not have the ability to spend bitcoins in those wallets. And all the private keys remain in a more secure back office setting available for accountants to move things around.
@_date: 2013-08-08 17:53:46
Those keep alives would have to be regenerated with each spend, not just when you generate a wallet. The amount of data you would have to push across the airgap would incentivize using insecure mediums like flash drives to push the signed transactions to the online side.

I can't see my bitcoins, but I know there exists a vast and diverse network of machines that hold the blockchain. I know the cryptography behind ecdsa is strong and prevent people from reproducing my keys that allow me to spend my money.
Yes, my bitcoins value is dependant on the internet and a whole bunch of other infrastructure, but i don't believe any of that infrastructure has a significant chance of disappearing and taking my value with it. And even if it does, I'm not keeping so much value in bitcoin that it would affect my life too much.

Faster processing of blocks means they can fork/diverge more often, which means you need to wait for a longer chain of blocks for the same security of bitcoin's 10 minute blocks. It's a wash.
the "lower barrier to entry (mining)" means that all servers on the planet are money making machines for botnets that would like to mine on free resources.
Spending bitcoins to litecoin and back does nothing for anonymity. Any shared bitcoin wallet system gives you the same level of anonymity.

It can only work for 2016 (2 weeks) and then the difficulty readjusts to accommodate their computing power contributions, such that the network only rewards for blocks every 10 minutes - adding more computing power only eventually nets you a larger percentage of the bitcoin booty. And anyone with a sufficiently large computing network can do this.
Also, consider that hashing with general computing is becoming less attractive as specialized hardware becomes more prevalent (ASICs). Google sized computing networks won't be able to compete unless they start using ASICs which is not relevant to their core computing needs.
General computing hardware, unfortunately, will always be attracted to altcoins like LiteCoin as long as they remain somewhat popular.

I was waiting to announce this AFTER I got at least one bar signed up, but it's looking that we're not too far away from that happening. I've got about a dozen guys meeting once a week for a "Bitcoin Lunch Mob" reaching out to their contacts and such to see if we can make other stuff happen. I've spend a couple hundred on marketing materials to show merchants bitcoin is a real thing with a growing community behind it. I have a really good feeling about where we'll take Bitcoin, especially in Vegas, this year.
The biggest issues I'm coming across is getting merchants cash for their bitcoins. We're working on some things to help with that. For example, transportation workers need to turn in cash at the end of their shift so I'm tightening up the relationship with localbitcoin.com exchangers and these hospitality workers to be able to get them dollars quick.
But right now, you can get some limited tour and entertainment packages and local business support and everyone participating is excited about it.

When running bitaddress.org on a local computer, use the bulk wallet option. this will create numerous keypairs all at once.
use zbarcam and qrencode to transfer key data between online/offline computers rather than using infectable media like flash drives.

The monetary units of bitcoin are scarce and limited. Currently only 11 million. Each one is only worth ~$100 for a total market firepower of ~$1 billion dollars to be used for any and all things the owners desire.
This is nothing compared to the potential fractions of global markets bitcoin can easily adopt like remittance, porn, ecommerce, import/export payments, black market, etc...
Since the monetary units are generally not adjustable, we're stuck with 11 million now, and 21 million total by 2140. The only other way to make Bitcoin more valuable to cover these new global markets is for the exchange rate per bitcoin to be higher - several thousand dollars higher. There just isn't any other way.

there is a feedback loop in the algorithm. The more processing power added to the network makes block creation happen at a faster rate. Every 2016 blocks the network makes takes a consensus on how long it took to create those blocks. If it was faster than two weeks, there is too much processing power for the problem being solve and everyone agrees the problem needs to be made more difficult. After four rounds of this, the network will stabalize to the new hash rate. The result is that blocks are guaranteed to only be manufactured on average of every 10 minutes for eternity.
The exact opposite happens if 2016 blocks took too long - every agrees to make the problem easier.
Lots of people are competing for the inflation money by guessing hashes and the market will weed out the inefficient ones. There is indeed a lot of working being done to win the block reward, currently about 25 trillion sha256 hashes per second around the world. That's more distributed computing power than all the known super computers combined.

That would make any reserve currency debt money. Consider asking a bank to hold your gold. They issue you a reserve note as convenience for bartering... no debt is created... the reserve note is just an easier instrument to handle and transfer. Anyone holding the reserve note can return to the bank and recover the gold. There is no debt to anyone involved.

Download the Electrum client.
Create an offline wallet.
Spend some bitcoins to the offline wallet.
Export the wallet's master_public_key and import it to an online computer (use QR code for data transfers to/from the offline computer from here on out)
Open the "seedless wallet" on the online computer. Spend some money. It will ask you to save an unsigned transaction to a file. 
Send the file's data to a QR code and send it to the offline computer. 
Open Electrum on the offline computer and import the transaction and sign it. It will ask you to save the signed transaction to a file.
Again, copy the signed transaction to the online computer via QR code.
Open your Electrum wallet in the online computer and import the signed transaction and click "broadcast to network".

Strings of well known phrases are not secure and thus would not fit in the model of a pro-tip recommendation.
an example of a convenient yet secure passphrase would be a combination of easily rememberable lifetime experiences. The facts used might be available by close people in your life, but the order, delimiters, and other complexities thrown in guarantee safe storage. For example: Brian*%Joseph*%Arthur*%Bennie are the order of my friends through childhood and *% is the delimiter. Easy to remember, impossible for anyone to guess since I would never tell anyone "hey, my brain wallet is the list of friends I had growing up, and I used some random keys inbetween their names".

You should get a blockchain.info wallet. Your keys are encrypted at THEN stored on their servers. Insta/Easy wallets are easily stolen if you reveal the wallet URL or if they service gets hacked, or they close their doors.
With Blockchain wallets, you'll get a backup of your keys, so they are always available, even if their service goes down.
All you need to give someone is your bitcoin address, either in bitcoin address form, or QR code. Optionally, you can setup short bitcoin addresses, called firstbits, or a shortening service like btc.to

So you are saying your bitcoins are gone and your balance is zero?
If this is the case, I fear you have not followed the instructions for use... each time you visit easy/insta wallet, you MUST bookmark the wallet url. If you don't, each visit back to the site will result in a new, empty wallet. The only way back to the funded wallet is if you have somehow bookmarked the url. This is clearly documented on the page.
If you have failed this, then you are going to have a hard time getting them back. Your best bet is to check your browser history for the url, or work with support. Due to the lack of identity they collect, support may not be able to help you unless you can prove you own the ip address that created the wallet.even then, it's going to be tough. Good luck.

Definitely yes. You'll be mitigating some vulnerability of using InstaWallet, but still there are some other vulnerabilities to be mindful of blockchain.
With InstaWallet, the secrecy of the URL is paramount, with a secondary concern for the system being hacked. If someone can shoulder surf your installwallet, the money is gone. If someone can login as you and browse your bookmarks, the money is gone. If someone hacks instawallet, your money is gone.
With blockchain, you don't have to worry about shoulder surfing, but a strong password is required on your account at all times. anyone with access to your backup files can brute force your backup file offline at any speed they have available to them. If blockchain gets hacked, an attacker can inject bad code to steal your bitcoins when you decrypt your wallet.
I consider blockchain safe enough for a couple hundred dollars of value at any time. for larger amounts, I use offline wallets such as bitaddress.org and electrum for ultimate security against malware theft.

I was talking about maying joint payments to an address for payment (something I've done at least a couple times to cause the ambiguity of who's who)... but actually signing inputs in a single transaction... that's a bit complicated and wonder if there is even a mechanism that will enable it without those two people sharing keys in a client to spend them.
@_date: 2013-06-01 01:49:12
I disagree. The mechanism of mining is the first system to fairly distribute new currency over a multi-generational timeframe. It is one of two core functions of mining which ar currency creation and transactional security.

I agree with your final statement, but once the "new users" are in the game, the dynamics change. My worry is the people only in it for the rise will leave when it stops, and begin the decrease. If you don't take the time to actually use the currency, then its going to have a rough time. Simply buying up bitcoins in the market and then dumping them back when you're not getting what you want out of it is damaging to everyone. If those same people were to alternatively say "ok, that's all the profit I can squeeze out of the network effect, I'm going to buy stuff now", the bitcoin economy would be much better off.

Governments would post a bitcoin address for each public works project.
Public works contractors would be obligated to make their subcontractor and vendor payment addresses public record.
People could voluntarily contribute whatever they wanted to whatever project they wanted to support.
Any politician or contractor diverting funds into any other account against the funds intended purpose would result in death. This would ensure the highest level of security for bitcoins held in the public's trust and guarantee they are used for their intended purpose.

secrets. DuPont takes the position that the trade secrets are a form of
intellectual property, and consequently, the company should be permitted to
take amortization deductions for the asset. However, the IRS denies these
deductions. Dupont appeals, and the court upholds the IRS determination,
based on the fact that DuPont failed to maintain secrecy, and therefore the
formulas can’t be treated as trade secret assets. Since there is no asset, there
can be no deduction.

Basically, every time a block of transactions gets created, a reward of inflation money is granted to the miner that does the work. This reward value starts off at 50 bitcoins in the first 210,000 blocks and gets cut in half every 210,000 blocks after. This is how bitcoin is limited to 21 million bitcoins. Now there is a feedback loop in the block generation process that limits it to once every 10 minutes on average. This is what guarantees the inflation rate over a period of about 130 years.
@_date: 2013-01-18 13:50:47
These are all plausible, but nothing is a current real threat. There is nothing on the horizon that indicates any of these will happen - so there no crisis of faith. As a matter of fact, there is a current vulnerability in zero transactions beyond the obvious. The developers are working on it and nobody's panicking while the value grows.
Any currency can suffer a crisis of faith, but there is nothing *real* coming at bitcoin at the moment. Except, perhaps, a government putting bullets in people's heads for using bitcoin. And I'm not even close to being convinced that will happen. They've fucked up their own currencies and policies enough at this point that the crisis of faith is against them now.

Mike Hearn explains it pretty well in his London talk - you make a relatively large single payment to a service provider in the blockchain, and then use a side channel to negotiate micro payments until the final act of settlement, which is a return of unused monies via the blockchain.

Perhaps you are unaware that electrum works perfectly offline and even allows for data to be passed literally across an airgap, via QR codes. Introducing writable media to an offline computer violates the security of the offline computer because it potentially introduces malware that can copy offline keys back to an online system.
With electrum, you have a seedless wallet online (no keys), and a seeded one offline. You created an unsigned transaction on the online side, display the data of the unsigned transaction in a QR code, read it via a webcam on the offline side, sign the tx, check the inputs/outputs, display the signed TX as a QR code, online computer reads it via a webcam and then forwards it on to electrum.

1 - In the context of your question Bitcoin doesn't get harder to mine - there is a production rate that eventually reaches zero over a period of a dozen decades or so. In the context of being a miner and in relation to other miners, it does get more difficult as more minders join the effort.
2 - Governments should serve the people, not the other way around. When it turns out the latter, then the people need to make a hard decision and effort to get off their lazy fucking asses and force the government to back down or change its tune.

Miners are always working the latest block. each time a new block is found, every block before it gets one more confirmation. If you get a reward of newly generated coins, those coins are not spendable until 120 new blocks are created on top of it. that is, if you got new coins from block 252631, you won't be able to spend them until block 252,751.

That's just not how open source works... What happens when it doesn't scale and requires another update to fix things and everyone has to update anyway.
This is not the reason it's closed source right now. It is closed source so that they don't have to release any code before there is critical mass adoption. If they release code before then, then the network effect will help squash any open source modifications that make XRP more fairly distributed and protect the developer's financial interest.

Instawallet is a shared wallet system. Everyone's btc is stored in the same bitcoin-qt wallet.dat file. So if even though you deposit to address '1example...', other people using the wallet might withdraw from that address. But the internal accounting system will maintain your proper balance for your instawallet id. 
Bottom line is, if you spend bitcoins to a bitcoin address listed on an instawallet, you'll see an unconfirmed balance almost instantly and it will be made available for spending after 4 confirms. If you never saw a balance from the instawallet site, then something went wrong. Seeing bitcoins spend from the address you sent to doesn't necessarily mean a bad thing.
Important to note, if someone can see your instawallet url, by any means: shoulder surfing, screen capture, bookmark syncing, keyboard logging (you typed in the url) then you're dead and your money can be stolen.
Contact support with your bitcoin address (do not send them your wallet id) and tell them your problem.

It's not always true, but generally true. The reason is bitcoin is the world's first truly monitarily deflating currency. That is, once we reach 21 million in circulation, they will only become more scarce due to attrition and the fact that all fiat currencies only inflate (because it's a great way to hide a tax on citizens). The increasing scarcity makes them generally more valuable over time compared to everything else.

One thing people often miss about mining is that there is a feedback loop that limits the rate of creation of the monetary units. No matter how much computing power is thrown at it, it only has a dramatic effect for 2016 blocks. When the network sees those blocks created faster than about 2 weeks, the problem gets more difficult to start adjusting to the new computing power. Same thing happens when that network hashing power dropps off - problem gets easier.

Also, accounts can be authenticated by issuing challenges to bitcoin keys. When you set up your account, tell then your bitcoin address. When you need to sign in later, they present you an arbitrary string for you to sign with your key, which they will verify with your public key on file.

Thanks for the kind words Piachu!
When these events come to Vegas, I'm typically invited by BitPay to help work the booth because I'm their local integration partner. This year, Roger Ver invited me first to help them prepare with getting promotional stuff for BitcoinStore.com/Blockchain and work the booth. Due do a snafu with available vendor passes, it was ultimately Fred from Coinbase that actually got me in to the conference. These guys I'm working with are true Bitcoin patriots and doing amazing work for the community. I'm very proud to have the opportunity to work next to people like Nicolas (Blockchain), Gabe Sukenik (Coinapult), Roger/Zlatko/David Perry (BitcoinStore), and Tony/Stephe (BitPay). And it was very fun meeting the new faces like you (ThePiachu), Megan Burton (CoinX),  Damijan/Nejc (BitStamp), etc.

No, we have a completely transparent, deflationary currency called bitcoin now.
Fiat is regulated by the whims of bankers and politicians who don't know their ass from a hole in the ground. Bitcoin is regulated by math and properties we all agree to from the start. Bitcoin is created from competitive work that must adhere to a well known inflation schedule regulated by mathematics  - not "lets run the fucking printing presses and give it to all our banker and financial industry friends to bail them out".

There are two kinds of inflation.. Monetary inflation and price inflation.
Monetary inflation is the increase in monetary units. Deflation is the destruction of monetary units.
Price inflation/deflation is usually the result of units in a comparitive commodity/currency.
Bitcoins are monetarily inflating now, through the year 2140 at which point they will cease to monetarily inflate. At some point before this, bitcoins will effectively deflate due to natural attrition of the monetary units - they will be taken out of circulation by failed hard drives with no backups, forgotten passwords, etc.
Ultimately, bitcoin is the worlds first truly monetarily deflating currency - even gold and silver continue to be monetarily inflated through mining, or imported from interstellar events.

Encrypting after the fact is ok as long as you understand it may be forensically recovered for an undeterminable amount of time while the old, unencrypted file waits to be overwritten by the OS. Not too many file systems guarantee a file can be purposefully overwritten. One way to mitigate this is to create a single large file in your file system that tries to exceed all free space after you encrypt your wallet.

I'm sure there might be some accounting of this asset, but surely they wouldn't call it "Bitcoin investments". Easily hidden.
Google has known about bitcoin and its potential for a long time. If they amassed 100,000 bitcoins (google chump change) slowly over the last 4 years, it's already worth 1.5 million. If google anounced it was integrating bitcoin into google wallet, can you even imagine what the price would soar to? $100 $500 $1000? Respectively, those amounts would be $10mil, $50mil, and $100mil. I would imagine that would be a nice sum to fun the development of bitcoin integration and a few other projects they had.

Gun guy checking in here...
Universal background checks are a ridiculous attempt to curb gun violence. Criminals do not go through background checks before they commit crimes, nor do they obey any other laws while they are engaging in their crimes. All this does is make the *real* law abiding citizens keep their firearms in the safe at home because its too much legal liability. When law abiding citizens keep their guns locked up at home,  criminals can break in and steal them while the owners are away and  criminals are more prone to break in to businesses and hold them up because the law abiding citizens left them at home while they went to work.
We have laws against illegal gun use. They don't work because criminals, by definition, ignore laws. Enable everyday citizens to defend themselves, increase the risk of death to the criminals who attempt violent crimes, and see what happens to crime rates.

It's a little more complicated than that because of how bitcoins get linked together and the distributed clues you leave behind with every transaction. If you want to dig deeper, try and google stuff about ["Baysean Inference"](


Yep. Go play around with BitAddress.org to see the relationship between a "public" bitcoin address, and a "private" key. Basically, the bitcoin address is a receive only account number. The private key is a mathematically related piece of information that lets you spend bitcoins to its corresponding public address. 
A wallet maintains these two numbers to allow you to receive bitcoins into it and spend bitcoins from it.


Yes. The donation address is irrelevant.. the most important part of verification is a picture that doesn't look edited. We're trying to keep dudes from stealing girl's photo collections and earning bitcoins off them.

The way bitcoin distributes the currency is the most fair possible. The author doesn't even attempt to offer any alternative, just complains about early adoptor advantage.


Deflation is not a problem. People can't save it to the point it's worthless or else it will not be worth saving. The random life situations will even out spending. And budgets help people comfortably spend bitcoins now with a discretionary spending budget AND allow them to save with a bitcoin savings budget.


This is not a problem left solely to Bitcoin. It will happen even to the dollar as the government continues to debase it. In fact, the deflationary aspect of Bitcoin helps prevent people abandoning it because of its increase scarcity as monetary units are lost to attrition.

BTW, I think it's much more likely that some big companies are subtly loading up on bitcoins and will eventually announce that they accept them (walmart, amazon, etc) full well knowing that doing so will explode their holdings and give them a bunch of new "early adopter" wealth that can fund the expansion of their business and profits.

Block size is a scarce commodity too.. If transactions continue to increase, they won't all fit in the block. Competition through increasing transaction fees will keep more "important" transactions in the block and push out the less priority ones. This means the transaction fees are pretty much guaranteed to make it worth it to miners to continue their work.

Yes, the difficulty can be lowered by contacting everyone else running a mining rig and convincing them to turn them off.
Sorry. The difficulty is a feedback loop that throttles the rate of block creation. The more computing power everyone throws at the task of creating blocks, the faster blocks get created. The faster blocks get created, the higher the difficulty gets to slow it down.
The only way to lower the difficulty is to remove hashing power from the network.
@_date: 2013-07-22 16:53:18
All it would take is a new transaction script that called a state run oracle that would return true or false. If the transaction hash ever became suspect, the government could black list the transaction and "return false" and the spend would become invalid at any time in the future.
A forkable event for sure, but it would not be that difficult. This would allow some types of transactions (based on their script type) to be revokable and some not to be.

wallet.dat is a database of all your keys for that wallet each of which are randomly generated. If you use a client like electrum, all keys in the wallet are deterministic, which means they are all derived from a single seed/passphrase. If you can remember the seed, or just back up that 256bits of data, your entire wallet is backed up and safe from destruction. You can even "deseed" that wallet after its generated so that the private seed is kept secure offline, yet all bitcoin addresses can still be determined. this is the ultimate in bitcoin security and easily done with electrum. you should play around with it. really fun stuff.

Ripple will have a much harder time overcoming the ponzi tag than Bitcoin did because the developers control all the "money" up front and have sole authority of distribution.

For me, these are the things that influence the price.
 network effect. There's currently relatively small numbers of users. A slightly larger set of potential users that have heard about it but fearful to get started and need to watch it for awhile before testing the water. The upside here is that there are billions of potential users.
 The benefits of bitcoin's features pretty much ensure that information about it will propagate and it will be desired and used by many in the future.
 Think market caps. Bitcoin is about 700 million right now. This is nothing compared to global markets. When you divide the number of monetary units across *real* global markets, you start to begin to understand bitcoin's scarcity and potential value as it slowly adopts fractions of these gigantic global markets.

just a minor correction.. in a stable hash rate environment, you'll burn through 8000 blocks in two weeks. But during a hash rate fluctuation, you really can only go by blocks to know when it will stablize. For example, you're at 20Th/s and all another 10 Th/s. the next 8000 blocks might take 3-4 days at the new 30Th/s. But 8000 is the measure for difficulty recalculation. And I think it's actually like 8016 or some wierd number.

I suppose this could be addressed with a 3rd party service. Basically you authorize a wallet service, like coinbase.com to withdraw from your account, within specified limits, from specified merchants. Merchants could get authorization from you to make monthly withdraws on your coinbase account up to $20 each month and coinbase would honor the withdraw requests. It doesn't seem impossible - but you'd have to trust a 3rd party with the private keys and coinbase would have to have some sort of authentication mechanism between customers and merchants.

As for the protocol itself, a zeroday means that all active transactions are susceptible. But all other bitcoin holdings are safe. Kinda the same thing with exchanges. If you're in an exchange when it gets hacked, you're going to have a bad day. But if you weren't, then all other bitcoins are safe in their distributed locations.
A zeroday in blockchain.info wallets would be bad for all active users until a fix was made.
My point is that a zeroday for bitcoin doesn't necessarily mean the immediate collapse of the entire system. You simply stop using it until the bad thing gets fixed.

It adds complexity you do not have to remember. This is highly valuable to people who demand using their pets name as a password.
This does not address malware keyloggers as nothing is safe at that point.
Additionally, this may afford you some deniability if ever confronted in court and "forced" to reveal your keys. If you "lose" the yubi key, you have the ability to say a large number of bits of your password has gone missing and you CANT reveal the passphrase since you have not committed those bits to memory.

If you are the only one that has access to your computing devices, then you're pretty safe that way. The same rules of access to your purse should apply to your computers. You wouldn't let an untrusted person rummage through your purse, don't let them do the same on your computer. Don't keep all your bitcoins in one place. Learn how to create a brainwallet (bitaddress.org or brainwallet.org) and keep some off-line. Use different clients like blockchain and electrum so if one gets compromised, you don't lose everything. Back EVERYTHING UP securely.


Public keys can be derived from private keys, so, kinda ya. A bitcoin address is a string of characters 33-34 characters long and always begins with a 1. a private key is a mathematically related number represented by a long string of characters that generally start with the number 5. For example: 15gsnQ1syS5ASSr5pSrPkFqpz1FF5SrNRo is tbe public key for this private key: 5KigXf8Ypsxe9D18nyhbiA3QuXnFfzEsEReXkJaCwvyh5EyhLBJ. If someone gets the private key, they can spend your bitcoins. You should play around with this at bitaddress.org. create a keypair and spend a little bitcoins to it. then import the private keys into your blockchain wallet. it's FUN and EDUCATIONAL. Highly recommended.

Controlling hashing power does not mean you can change the existing blockchain record. They could not steal previously generated bitcoins past the point that they started mining. They could "earn" some future bitcoins by created the new blocks - having the option to stall everyone's transactions by not including them in the new blocks. Game theory suggests it is not in their best interest to be malicious and will continue mining new blocks with transactions included.

Its my position that any new user trying to jump in the "lets be anonymous" pool is going to have a bad day. Anonymity is not simply running TOR. Relying on any one's solutions to protect you is not sufficient. You need to know a LOT of shit and be able to do everything on your own. If you don't know what you're doing at any point and do something wrong, you're potentially compromising your life, freedom, and assets. Sometimes, doing stuff "the hard way" keeps your edges sharp and helps you avoid costly mistakes when they might matter.

The purpose of infinite divisibility is so that the monetarily deflating currency will have enough units to support functional values in global markets.
If 50% of all bitcoins are lost to attrition, supply decreases and value increases to the point that .00000001 bitcoins won't pay for your monthly cell bill because it's worth $500. By increasing the number of decimal places, you're enabling the splitting of bitcoins to small enough values for these types of small purchases.

Transactions you submit are digitally signed, so no, they can't mess with your transactions.
What they can do: Misreport balances you ask for that are maintained in your client and refuse to hand off your signed transaction to the network.

A tactical "go" bag is for preppers that need to be ready to bail out at any given moment... it's a duffle bag that's got everything you need to make it a couple days on your own: passport, money, a firearm/weapon, change of clothes, food. Part of any hi-tech prepper's arsenal should include a bitcoin brainwallet. It's no different than a regular brain wallet: it's just something I've adopted for the preppers to be inclined to make use of it in a way they'd understand.

Yep... 1 block per 10 minutes works out to be 210,000 blocks in about 4 years. There are subtle increases in speed between difficulty changes so overall block time is slightly quicker than 10 minutes and the halving happens quicker than 4 years.

The problem with their plan is that by the time the deflationary spiral worries get to be a problem, the market cap will be trillions of dollars at which point, we'll flip the switch that divides them to 16 decimal places and they will all of the sudden be usable to buy sticks of gum again.
Don't forget about the part about bitcoins having to be worth trillions at that point. That is an important, and joyous point to ponder.

Bitcoin has no image problem. In case you missed it, people are going mad for it at $86. People are more angry at central bankers for raiding their accounts either by ridiculous fees or for bailouts - not to mention the lack of prosecution for any of those fucks. People don't give a shit that $2 million a month in bitcoin is being use to buy drugs, while HSBC launders billions of dollars for drug lords and don't receive even a slap on the hand.

yea, it's not a scavenger hunt. passguardian splits your secret passphrase (brainwallet, cryptokeys, anything) into N number of shares where M of those share are required to rebuild your secret. For example, you can split it 5 ways and give each share to a family lawyer, spouse, employer, friend, and in-law. Only 3 of those people (example) need to know to get together after your demise to rebuild your secret. all three of them type in their share of the secret to rebuild your brainwallet key and can then spend your money.

Insta/Easy wallet is a "shared wallet" system. Basically all user's bitcoins are stored in one instance of bitcoind (wallet.dat). There is a separate backend accounting system to maintain balances in your wallet id. 
The effect is that when you deposit money to a bitcoin address, bitcoind may or may not use funds at that particular address to payout other users. There is nothing wrong with this, and has some great anonymity benefits. As long as your wallet id reflects the correct balance, you're safe.
Now, don't use insta/easy wallets for anything more than a very small, riskable amount of money. I've seen people put $2000 in an insta/easy wallet for a couple hours with no problem, but you really don't want to be trusting that much money over significant period of time.
