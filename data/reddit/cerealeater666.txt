Why not just use YouTube  and Changetip? I dont understand how a less functional version of YouTube will gain their market share.  Where is the use case?

Even worse it's all in the subject line which means it isn't encrypted even if you enable encryption. The first step all these exchanges and services (I'm lookin at you bitquick.co, coinbase) should take is to keep transaction data out of the subject line! It's obscene. Nobody wants to complain because they don't want to draw the suspicion of their compliance departments. It's the 'nothing to hide, so make everything public' syndrome that pervades so much of the public debate right now. Speak up, and you are suspicious

Probably safer to start a bitcoin meet up where spontaneous trading would occur, explicit or not. Another option other than LBC is the Mycelium wallet's local trader functionality.

Bitcoin definitely has an image problem. I'd like to see a campaign play into, rather than mitigate bitcoin's bad boy image. A sort of gorilla marketing with street art, bitcoin scavenger hunts, and snappy billboard slogans like "Own it". Some money, and I'm all over it, though I could use a little help. Where da marketing profs and big spenders at?

True and the people responsible for his prosecution and persecution include some others. It is hyperbole to describe MIT as responsible. It is not hyperbole to blame MIT for enflaming the situation, and for leaving a bright young fellow intellectual and world-changing idealist so exposed to the cold metal hand of the post 9/11 state.

Go to a bitcoin meetup or anywhere you can find enthusiasts, and buy some bitcoins. Transact with TOR. Never reveal your identity. It is very possible. If you have to come to the surface to transact with state compliant entities, then use a mixer or create an air gap so as not to taint the trail of all your stash.

Silly question, like "So you think the internet is anonymous?", or "So you think the dollar is anonymous?" Things aren't anonymous, people are. A better, more relevant question would be, "is it possible to use bitcoin anonymously?" Answer: resoundingly, yes.

Did Obama really talk about de-escalating the drug war before 2012? I thought that was a more recent thing. 
I'm with you though. Screw voting, it only adds to their legitimacy. How it is that 30-50 percent turnout amounts to a legitimate representative government is beyond me.

Is a "reporter" the same thing as a "reputation user"?
This all sounds fascinating but the presentation is missing something: a video showing how it works. 
As is, I'm finding it difficult to get excited about, not having any experience, academic or otherwise, in prediction markets.
Show us what it could look like. At least maybe some comparisons to things we might know, or an imaginary walkthrough. 
All the best.

"Attack : Pushing the price down."
Isn't that a good thing? You aren't suggesting that it is possible for a seller to push the price down permanently are you? They would need infinite coins to do that. The most would be a short term swing in price, creating nothing but a window of buying opportunity. You should be cheering short term volatility if you are looking at bitcoin as an investment or medium, long term store of value. The one problem your hypothesized manipulation causes is for its use as a currency. Only time and further adoption can build the confidence necessary to quell speculators itchy trigger fingers and weaken any single whale's ability to move the market. Its true bitcoin is in its early stages. Participation is not for the faint of heart, its for the pioneers, idealists, and visionaries--for now. Nobody knows where this is going, even the scary whales.
@_date: 2015-04-26 15:56:46
This isn't an hypothesis. Can you at least define your terms? What is an attack? And what are big banks speculators? What effect do you suppose these attacks are having exactly? Wouldn't misinformation actually be good for the well informed among us? "The more you know..."

Interesting. I sell through Bitquick and explicitly informed coinbase that I do so. Its been weeks and I haven't received any warnings from them. 
theblacksquid_05, that wouldn't necessarily work. I suspect coinbase follows 3 hops at least, and Coinbase is going to inquire about the source and destination of any high volume buyers, like they did me.

"Why is it so hard for people to answer and agree on this simple question"
Price discovery isn't about everyone agreeing. It's fluid. Everyone gets a chance to name their price. I regularly get 5% above major market value. Does that mean that is the "real value"? I dunno, we could talk about what on earth you mean by that, or you can realize that it's worth what you get, it's worth what you pay--it only matters what it's worth to you and the other person involved in a trade at that time. Free markets don't operate on consensus or by central control, they work by free association, peer to peer. Pick a price, and try to find another person who agrees, just one.

Anonymity is not the main usecase. Peer to peer is. Free association, an enabler of human relations. Consumer products, unless restricted or made ineffective or inefficient by current mechanisms, are not bitcoin usecases. Unless we are talking financial services, but bitcoin makes many financial services d.i.y. rather than consumer services to sell.

Surveillance (cloud, portable options)
Physical security (including friends, kevlar vests, mace, tazer, gun)
Plausible deniability (decoy wallet, hidden partitions)
Careful wallet management (carry only what you need)
There are risks to being your own bank. Think like a bank. Don't brag about your bitcoins.
Edit: I hate to say it but this issue points directly at one of bitcoin's biggest adoption problems. Trusted 3rd parties, whether it be the state, or a bank, are desired entities for the risk-averse and the weak. All this talk recently about bitcoin being male dominated is a real issue, and a sensitive one since the equality police, and marxist-feminist fucktards are the bread and butter of the state these days.

Haha yeah it has. I'm so curious how all this will play out. As soon as the government touches bitcoin's code, we splinter. The government, at best it seems, can keep bitcoin (or decentralized crypto) in the margins. The idea won't just lay down and die unless the need for it does. This kind of currency could exist under the nose of even the most authoritarian control.

I think Reid Hoffman, Co-founder and Chairman of Linked-In, just stated it pretty well on an CNBC interview as I was reading this thread:
"I think marketplaces are kind of the heart of capitalism. It's how you put buyers and sellers together. When you take these internet marketplaces like EBay, Alibaba, like AirBNB...you take out all this friction, all of these complications, and you make a pure play that increases productivity, allows small players to participate, creates better products and experiences. So marketplaces are one of the things that we are going to see transformations. I mean, people back in the day thought EBay and Alibaba, those are my marketplaces. Now you have AirBNB and I think you're going to have more in the future."
He goes on to talk about bitcoin:
"Bitcoin I think is like the invention of the internet, which is an open tech platform that softwares can then build on top of. So I think that Bitcoin presents the first infrastructure layer that financial applications can be built on top of globally. Now, whether or not it happens or doesn't happen, it's very high beta, but if it does happen, it's world transforming."

This is obviously your secret sauce. The process of validating recipients is the absolute key to the social goodness your service will provide. The technology aspect of this isn't actually a huge differentiator compared to other charities. The "what" is basically the same, the "how" is a little different technologically; how different the "how" of your charity works is yet to be determined because your secret process of determining who is deserving or valid will be the only thing that really matters in the end. Matching donors to the needy isn't a new concept by a long shot. Most important would be making it efficient, low cost, and addressing the problem that some of the people most "in need" are going to lack the technology or social connections to take advance of your service.

I'm unclear on your use of the term criminal. Is that a person or group of armed men who steal half my money under coersion and at gunpoint, all the while claiming that I have agreed to some something called a social contract? Is it a cult of personality who indoctrinates children by forcing them to pledge alliegance to an entity made up by a bunch of rich white dead men who claim to represent people they have never met and don't understand?

Why is nobody using Bitquick? No bank account needed. Deposit cash and get bitcoins often in less than 1 hour.  There are 20 btc for sale, pretty much at market value right now. 10 are mine. Buy my bitcoins for god's sake.
