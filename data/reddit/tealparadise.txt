Then the dollar is deflating because it's strong against the Euro and Yen, meaning I can purchase more in TWO countries now.
@_date: 2014-01-12 11:58:46
oh that is just lovely.  Well now I know how I'm getting my $$$ out of here when I go back to the USA.

So true.  If you go to  , you will note that all of these things are also advantages of the furikomi system (bank transfer system).  I'm racking my brain trying to think of something Bitcoin offers that cash transfers do not.  
  
Their currency is currently inflating exactly as they wanted it to, so there is just literally no reason for them to care.  
  
EDIT:  derp.  I forgot the reason I got into Bitcoin myself.  Foreign currency exchange.  The one thing that really sucks in Japan is trying to transfer money outside of Japan.
@_date: 2014-01-22 00:09:25
Is that a Mt Gox rule, or simply logistics?  (e.g. I am fully aware I am unable to withdraw USD through my bank)  I'll have to look into this more fully regardless, but what I hope to do is deposit in JP before moving stateside, and then withdraw USD to a US bank once there.

were you able to give a negative rating?  Or can you not give one if the transaction is cancelled? 
@_date: 2014-01-27 00:36:51
There was about a $50 dip for approx 12 hours 3 days ago...  (yes I bought)
@_date: 2014-01-12 03:57:00
Haha, thanks for this comment.  I feel like I'm taking crazy pills.  They asked for a Japanese perspective, but it seems no one really wants one.
@_date: 2018-05-24 00:45:24
And how would the transactions have been different if it was in BTC?   Paypal is a safety measure that often fails.  BTC has no safety measures and is more similar to sending a money order.
@_date: 2014-01-12 03:10:28
I am in Japan and had no idea it was here.  Does this mean I can do a normal furikomi transfer to it?
@_date: 2014-02-07 01:54:29
But why now?  That's what's confusing- what's driving it?
@_date: 2014-02-06 07:12:38
Check out Bitfinex right now, it's going crazy.
@_date: 2014-01-19 02:45:04
right, but it's the exact same problem that credit cards (would) have- data security.  Only with credit cards you're not liable.  
  
Both bitcoin and credit have this problem.  Credit solves it in the customer's favor.  Bitcoin tells the customer they're stupid.
@_date: 2014-02-04 03:20:17
It's a pretty bad idea.... you can sell gift cards for cash at numerous places on the web already, but this service is charging you a premium to get bitcoin for it.  Last time I was flipping cards, Starbucks was worth about 75-80 cents on the dollar in cash.  I guess if you would convert the cash to bitcoin anyway the cut isn't that much more.  But it's definitely a bigger cut than is taken for card to cash.  
  
It's obvious what this guy is doing- genius as it is.  He is draining the cards and reloading new ones, then selling them for cash to the usual sites &amp; getting more than he gave you.

I don't really know enough to say it's going to/not going to work.  I'm just saying what the reality is right now.  People are not nearly at the point where they're thinking "Hm, better get my savings out of here!  This ship's going down!"  Japan has been slumped for 20 years, if they can get their export economy moving again (I'm not saying that they can- I actually agree with your post below about Korea and China) they'd go back to the 90s.  People are still holding out hope for that.  
  
I agree that this is kind of the last "Well we tried everything, go big or go home" move.  So we'll see whether anything comes of it.  
  
If it did start to fail noticeably, we might see interest in bitcoin from individuals.  If that doomsday "spiraling inflation" thing had come true, we'd definitely be seeing more interest now.
@_date: 2014-01-14 03:23:41
well that's an awful system.
@_date: 2014-01-12 03:49:13
The reason his ratings are plummeting are mostly unrelated IMO.  I think [this article]( states it best- that yes the clock is running out, but he's not lost the populace yet.  The nationalism and state secrets bill were the big waves over his popularity rating.  People understand why and how this economic plan can work.  Japan is not just an import economy, they are an export economy.  If the yen devalues, imports are more expensive but exports are less expensive.  And exports are a huge part of their job market.
@_date: 2014-01-12 03:08:55
What do you mean by "weakening?"  The currency is currently doing exactly what they want it to do.  
  
Edit: I am aware what it means to weaken the currency.  I am questioning the implication in these posts that having a weaker currency is necessarily a bad thing when you economy is based on exports.  It's being purposefully weakened right now, so it's not like people are going to abandon ship.
@_date: 2014-12-10 23:32:50
Said me after trying to use it as a currency.   (should have been the perfect situation for bitcoin too- but the practicalities of working with it were too annoying and fees made it much more expensive than cash)
@_date: 2014-01-28 06:56:24
Exactly.  The only reason I have to use it is the "wild west" aspect- I can transfer cash cross-borders more easily (the same loopholes that are involved in the current money-laundering scheme), and I can ride the waves to profit.  These things are what will kill it.  You can't make money like this on a real currency.  
  
It's like when I was on fucking Neopets and the biggest guild would buy up millions of some stupid potion and drive the price through the roof, prompting non-members to buy and send it even higher.  Then the big players cash out at a huge profit and crash the price while the non-members wonder what's going on.   
  
With no regulation, it's basically the same.  We're trusting that these groups don't want to see bitcoin fail, and thus will keep their CRIMINAL ACTIVITY minimal.  Not even that they won't do it- just that they'll be a little discreet about fucking everyone.
@_date: 2014-01-27 00:43:10
I'm in Japan, is there any way I could help people with this?  
  
Edit:  apparently there is.  If your $$$ is stuck in mt Gox and you're okay with helping me through the process and paying a bit for my time (and the annoyance of having a ton of Yen when I would rather have USD)  
I will take your money out of Mt Gox in Yen, then send you USD via a bank transfer from BofA or Ally (at whatever the current exchange rate is).
@_date: 2014-02-05 00:53:19
I'll sell for BTC and move to fedora.  That one's the most hilarious anyway.  I liked it when it wasn't a real coin though.  That was the best.
@_date: 2014-02-18 01:55:07
This is such a better idea.  
  
Right now, the bitcoin ad is the only Reddit ad I don't want to see.  Usually Reddit is pretty safe to have up on my work computer, but the bitcoin ad makes it look extremely unprofessional.  It's garish and stands out like "LOOK I'M PLAYING GAMES!"  Really off-putting.  
  
Think about that- the bitcoin ad is the LEAST professional, MOST obnoxious advertisement on the ENTIRE SITE.  It also only brings people to this sub, which is not super useful to bitcoin on the whole.  A link to a tipping guide would be way better.
@_date: 2014-02-06 07:33:25
There's a huge pachinko chain in Japan called silk road.  There are numerous restaurants throughout asia with it...   It's almost like the name is based on something....
@_date: 2014-01-14 03:21:52
Right?  I bought bitcoins this way, assuming the person would just transfer once they actually hit the account.  Nope- asked for a receipt pic.  WTF.  The last place I worked at (granted it wasn't a bank) I could print a receipt for ANYTHING if I wanted.  I mean hell, the photoshop on something like this would be so freaking easy too.  Just replace a number somewhere.  
  
Taking pix as proof is NOT safe.
@_date: 2014-12-10 23:38:47
I have had basically the same situation both times I tried to use bitcoin, and my purpose was to simply get my money from one currency to another as I moved around abroad.  High fees everywhere, price slippage during transactions, walking to the bank to deposit cash into some random Thai guy's account hoping he sends the coin....   
  
No way.
@_date: 2014-01-12 03:43:48
Abe was literally brought into office for this plan...  Japan has been in a slump for like 20 years now... they need an inflationary period... this is just basic.
@_date: 2014-02-04 03:10:07
Hey, I started mining doge for exactly the same reason.  I spent hours clicking between bitcoin mining sites trying to make heads or tails of it months ago, and then gave up.  
  
The dogecoin wallet mines for me and installed itself instead of needing me to do something weird to install it.  I just input the info my mining pool gave me &amp; click "dig."  
  
Plus it's way more fun to tip doge.  Bitcoin is srs bsns now.  If I'm gonna tip bitcoin I may as well just buy reddit gold.  It's real money, not fun stuff.
@_date: 2014-01-12 11:56:49
I think from any reasonable perspective the yen works just fine.  Most of the problems bitcoin wants to solve are not problems in Japan.  There's simply no reason for anyone to care.
@_date: 2014-01-28 06:30:53
Yup... I believed all the bitcoin hype until I actually started using it.  The middlemen are WAY bigger than any other method of currency, and they don't offer protection.  I no longer understand what bitcoin offers over credit (protection) or cash (no fees).  
  
I guess because I'm not a "decentralization" believer, seeing as decentralized so far seems to mean "easily and predictably manipulated."  I mean, it's fine for me since I'm profiting on the current predictable fake sell-off, but I no longer actually believe in bitcoin....
@_date: 2016-03-03 22:24:11
A chargeback is an arbitration with the credit provider to decide whether the charged service/product was indeed delivered.  Both sides present their case &amp; the mediator (Visa in your case) decides who is in the right.  It is a buyer &amp; seller protection.  It is not similar to a double-spend.  
  


  
While small businesses may not accept credit, this is not the reason.  You cannot just charge back willy-nilly.  
@_date: 2017-09-22 21:09:16
Right... as an extreme casual who has seen what BTC went through over the past few years.... That's what I don't understand &amp; why I'm not a "believer."  
  
The only thing I like less than big banks controlling my economy, is a handful of self-interested programmers / for-profit mining conglomerates controlling my economy.  
   
     
If BTC starts to gain any kind of traction, why in the world would it not be replaced?  It's shown itself to be incredibly weak to infighting and attacks by petty interests.  
@_date: 2017-09-23 01:21:30
1. it's exactly because of those issues that I sold ages ago and don't dabble in it anymore, luckily cashing out right before Finex shit the bed.  And I'd argue that's why 90% of the people who actually know what it is (which is a small number already) don't fuck with it.  Look around- who is on this forum right now other than people whose belief verges on religious?     
   
2.  I don't want to know about brilliant work.  I want it to function as money.  
  
3. "where you choose to store a significant amount of monetary value." - yeah, which is why people will be much more cautious about storing anything in a currency that branches and has loud public fights about the very nature of itself.  Sure bitcoin "could" adopt new code, but I doubt its ability to do so.  
   
4.  There are hundreds of extinct currencies for exactly this reason.   Thanks for bringing it up.
@_date: 2017-07-28 14:52:50
Are you going to actually refute or no....? 
@_date: 2013-12-26 13:29:08
Huh?  I would guess you mean "your hands are not tied" because either we don't have to use bitcoin, or we can do something about this group.  Not using bitcoin kills the bitcoin.  I don't see what we can do about this group.  So yes, it seems like hands are tied.  
  
And as for blindfolds, for bitcoin to be a real currency people shouldn't need to be keeping tabs on every detail of mining and the different companies that try to control it.  If you wanted to do that, you could just as easily do it with USD and the banks.  
  
If a group can "make" money (for even a few minutes) by double-spending, they do indeed have a different set of rights compared to the layperson.
@_date: 2013-12-31 13:44:18
yep.  I wanted to get bitcoin locally but literally the only people selling are like 3 guys in Tokyo.  Foreigners too, not Japanese people.
