I got this mail by Skrill today.  
Dear xxxxxxx  
 We are contacting you to let you know that we are making changes to some of the [Skrill Account Terms of Use]( that govern our relationship with you and the way we provide the Skrill Services.  
The changes will come into effect on March 13, 2019.  
You can view the new Skrill Account Terms of Use by clicking on the link above. We have also taken this opportunity to provide you with a summary of the changes below.  
1. Skrill Service Fees
The following change shall apply to the service fee referenced in the Skrill Account Terms of Use:  
Your Skrill Account is free for personal use as long as you login or make a transaction at least every 12 months. If you don't do this, a monthly service fee of EUR 5.00 (or equivalent) will be deducted monthly from the funds in your Account.
1. Termination or suspension of your Skrill Account
We may now at any time suspend or terminate your Skrill Account without notice if we have reason to believe that another Skrill or NETELLER account held by you has been used for any fraudulent activity, money laundering, terrorism financing or other criminal activity.  
These changes will come into effect on March 13, 2019 and will automatically apply to the services Skrill provides to you. Your continued use of the Skrill services after March 13, 2019 will be taken as your acceptance of the above changes. Please get in [contact ]( us should you need further information.  
Regards,  
Skrill Team   
  
So, I'm holding crypto currency in my Skrill account but you are forcing me spend 5 euro monthly payment now?!? What a shame.
