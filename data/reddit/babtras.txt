You wouldn't have to overhaul the network to accomplish this. Just update the wallets to display mBTC as the base unit. I think many already have this feature. So if you want your 0.3 BTC to look impressive, set the preferences on you wallet to show balances in uBTC and now you have 300,000.

This was an excellent read. But I only upvoted it after reading your complaint.  
  
The issue is that a trusted player in the bitcoin game appears to have a backdoor that they won't acknowledge or lack the competence to discover and resolve. The possibility of this being done in other, less discoverable, ways with other exchanges and online wallets is truly terrifying.

While I agree (I use a Trezor and even that isn't hack-proof), we need it to be simple for non-technical people to get into crypto currencies. But if my father, for example, decides to get in by opening an account and has his bitcoin stolen almost immediately, he's going to walk away and never come back. He is not likely to ever even get into it if he has to own two different computers to use it (one for banking and one for everything else).
  
Dabbling in crypto is a dangerous game with official sites getting hacked and serving malware, officially sanctioned wallets skimming a bit of each transaction or stealing private keys, web wallets with malicious code to enable theft, etc.

This is a truly concerning scenario. When I claimed and sold my fork coins I also moved my bitcoin because of possible replays, but didn't think about the private key leakage bit.
