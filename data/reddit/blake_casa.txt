Hey, sorry you're having this issue. I'd suggest emailing [help for a response from a dedicated support team member, if you haven't already. Someone there should be able to help you sort this out.

Hi u/forrest_p,
If your mesh routers are just repeaters for the main router, then it should still work. It may be an issue with your node's IP address, and there are a couple of easy workarounds for that. I'd recommend emailing [help with your issue (you could even copy/paste what you have here) and someone will be able to get back to you with specific troubleshooting instructions.
Feel free to DM me any time with questions.

Hi u/v_chan,
With the way our 3-of-5 and 2-of-3 solutions are set up, even if Casa were immediately and permanently unreachable (i.e. destroyed), you can still access your multisig yourself, without need of the Casa recovery key or our app. We also train our Platinum and Diamond members how to use their hardware device to access their funds via Electrum or another open source solution. Were Casa to ever need to shutter, we wouldn't just abandon our users—there would be an orderly transition and consultation. We're a customer-first company, and we always will be! Feel free to DM me if you have any specific questions you'd like answered :)

All are great options, and no matter which you choose, I'm stoked that another node will be joining the network. I can't speak to the nuances of RaspiBlitz, but I can definitely speak to some of what I believe are the advantages of the Casa Node. As you mentioned, it's plug-and-play, and that means a lot to people who aren't as technical or don't have the time to set up and troubleshoot their own node. On that note, the Casa Node comes with dedicated support. Any time you have an issue with your node, just shoot us an email and we're there to help you solve it ASAP—you won't have to sift through forums for a solution.
Casa Node also comes with a free year of Keymaster Gold membership (more on this [here]( which includes access to our 2-of-3 Multisig, a Trezor and Faraday Bag. You don't *have* to use the Gold membership, and either way the Casa Node and all future software updates are yours in perpetuity.
If you have any questions, feel free to DM me. I'm happy to answer whatever you've got!
