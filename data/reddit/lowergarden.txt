That's only part of their salary. Wonder how much more of it is cash.

I first purchased some Bitcoin and litecoin on coinbase a couple weeks ago. Everything was great. I then deposited cash to transfer over to GDAX to avoid fees which was also great. I like how coinbase shows me a portfolio with total amount in each coin all on one page. My question is how do you keep track of how much you invested? I am looking for a wallet to store my coins on that would show an overview of all coins owned.

Correct. Any recommendations?

Use the coinbase app. From there you can use your phone's camera.

When it comes back up, use the coinbase app to take the photo ID picture. It didn't work when trying to use the computer webcam.

Verify through the coinbase app
