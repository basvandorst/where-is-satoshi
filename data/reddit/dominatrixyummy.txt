The crime they are targeting is tax evasion. Many sole traders do cash-in-hand jobs where they can to avoid having to declare that income - typically those in trades, but also IT workers. The government estimates this “black economy” is worth 50 billion.
The ban is only when paying a business or an individual with an ABN, which is required for sole traders  with an annual turnover of $75k (or around that).
*disclaimer: I do not support this legislation, just aware of the details being Australian.

This is a good bit of fun. I only played a few rolls though.
Deposits and withdraws went through without a hitch.

Not to say you're making this up, but do you have any evidence to back up this claim? And by whistleblower, are you implying you are / were possibly involved in the verification of false transactions?

Sorry, I'm not very good at conveying sarcasm early in the morning.
Lets get some custom CSS going on!

How much did you pay?
@_date: 2011-08-26 11:46:41
Hell yeah. I'll be there for sure.
@_date: 2011-06-16 07:32:09
Only use that wallet for receiving money.
@_date: 2011-09-12 07:04:25
Cool, thanks for that :)

Yeah, it appeared in Block Explorer so I think all has gone well!

Wow mooncoin guy, way to totally help the current image problem bitcoin has. Dick.
@_date: 2011-08-16 04:27:21
Right, I've just submitted an order. I'll return when I receive the 1 BTC I purchased. Cool idea!
*Edit:* The BTC transfer has gone through, great job!

I did the same thing for 'Bad Santa' at my work Christmas party this year. Unfortunately the envelope got picked last so I didn't get to see how popular it could have been :(

Here if anyone is interested:

Same situation here. I actually built a working prototype Australian exchange, but never had the balls to actually open it up for beta.
In the end it was probably a good thing, as another dodgy exchange was the last thing bitcoin needed after the 2011 bubble.
@_date: 2013-04-12 12:21:41
yeah definitely in the long run down now
