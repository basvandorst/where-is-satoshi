Do we have a list of subreddits in which changetip is banned? I just tried to tip someone in and it looks it didn't work

That's awesome, thanks for the heads up! Just booked a 4* hotel in Amsterdam for $78 via Expedia US using some of my seals for clubs earnings.

Scene starts at 33:43. Here's a quick transcript. 
Walter Isaacson: *Do you think Bitcoin will be disruptive in that way? I mean now it’s a speculative currency, will it be something that will be what normal consumers will use and will disrupt the banking industry?*
Elon Musk: My opinion on Bitcoin is, I mean I think Bitcoin is probably a good thing.  But it’s essentially, its main thing will be [inaudible] I think it’s primarily gonna be a means of doing illegal transactions [laughs]. But that’s not necessarily entirely bad. You know, some things maybe shouldn’t be illegal.   
Isaacson: *A combination of Silk Road and Bitcoin will save us?*
Musk: Well, it will be useful for legal and illegal transactions. Otherwise it would have no value as a use for illegal transactions. Because you have to have a legal to illegal bridge. I don’t own any Bitcoin.

Just my 2c on Bitcoin adoption in Latin America having traveled in the region in Dec 14. [disclaimer: the below is merely based on a quick google search before I arrived; happy to hear if you've made other experiences]
**Santiago (Chile):**
Was excited to spend my bitcoins at California Cantina, having read [this]( article from Jan 14, unfortunately, staff that day didn't know about bitcoin, ended up paying with CC. 
**Punta Arenas (Chile)**
**Ushuaia (Argentina)**
**Buenos Aires** Tried to exchange via Local Bitcoins: Huge markup to blue dollar rate, out of town. Ended up exchanging a few pesos with a  guy from bitpagos, an Argentinian bitcoin merchant, who went out of his way on a Monday morning to help me out. (say hello to the guys at Espacio Bitcoin when you're in town, great bunch of people)
