I have only seen it on youtube, I don't think there's an official version like that.

To be fair, the same can be done with many sitcoms, like Friends (especially in the later series). Joey is basically just mentally deficient without the laugh track, Ross is a psycho (even more so than normally), Phoebe should be institutionalized, Chandler is just sad etc.
In fact, the only series that I found to be way better without the laugh track (and that originally had one) was MASH, which had it officially removed as an alternative version for a box set and I'm guessing that was edited/cut in a way that it doesn't seem weird.

One small vindication is that they never put a laugh track to scenes in the operating room or in other very serious scenes, even if they had funny moments, so there's at least that.

I'm not sure what the original wording was, but if they said something like "I'm gonna eat my left testicle", they can just buy a pair of bull testicles and eat the left one, right? The possessive still applies, since after they buy them, they are their property and they can just cook and eat the left one, which, however gross it may be, is not that much out of ordinary.

Wouldn't it be more appropriate to compare Bitcoin to a single specific distro? A bitcoin is a bitcoin, if there's a major change, it forks and it becomes a different crypto. Compare some distribution of Ubuntu, Fedora, Gentoo, or even something like SteamOS or Chrome OS. Sure, they are all Linux systems, but they are vastly different, same as different cryptocurrencies - the closer they are to a joint origin, the more similar they are as well. And while you probably can say Linux isn't going anywhere in general, you can't say with certainty that a specific Linux distribution will still be maintained in 10 or 20 years...
