I don't really understand the question. I've been researching Bitcoin for a few months now, so i'm pretty knowledgeable. I just want to clear things up. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 13:44:06
What would that be? 
@_date: 2017-05-08 00:42:43
What other user friendly way do you suggest to buy BTC
@_date: 2017-05-09 23:28:51
PIN's are easy to crack, I want to implement a complex password. 
@_date: 2017-05-26 20:53:27
Lol is it though. I'm not buying BTC right now for 3k 
@_date: 2017-05-25 14:50:11
Plan on it cause thats like my only option... how does the ATM process work? Do you have to wait for some sort of confirmation? 
@_date: 2017-05-25 15:03:05
Is the transfer instant?

Gemini still not available in Wisconsin :( do you know when they plan to expand? 
@_date: 2017-05-25 14:54:51
Milwaukee, WI at a checks cashed place. I'm hoping theres no big fees either 
@_date: 2017-05-09 23:27:41
Even a hardware wallet? 
I still have no idea what a "node" is
@_date: 2017-05-26 04:23:54
If only it was available in WI :,(
@_date: 2017-05-05 20:16:34
Oh? Interesting. Everywhere I look Coinbase is being referred to as a "wallet" 
@_date: 2017-05-26 20:44:42
Lol, fees on Localbitcoins are outrageous 
@_date: 2017-05-09 23:59:26
Have you ever bought BTC through Breadwallet? 
@_date: 2017-05-05 18:31:46
Needed this. Thank you
@_date: 2017-05-25 11:47:50
Do you honestly think theres gonna be another dip? 
@_date: 2017-05-05 19:13:52
Whats another wallet service that is more secure? 
@_date: 2017-05-29 16:43:20
Thats great and cute but its really not cutting edge tech or anything, I mean you could technically do this with paypal
@_date: 2017-05-25 14:58:48
Yeah I know about them :p just confused as to how to use it exacty, and how long it will take for the BTC to get to my bread wallet. 
@_date: 2017-05-05 20:21:21
Alright that makes sense. What wallets do you recommend for iOS? Sorry for all the questions, I just want to get a clear understanding of everything before I put money into it. 
@_date: 2017-05-05 19:54:48
But your wallet is within Coinbase right? I'm hearing that giving information like this to Coinbase is a bad idea due to susceptibility to hacks? Thanks. 
@_date: 2017-05-23 05:22:47
I tried checking out localbitcoins. Not sure if i'm doing something wrong but there are very few users who do card transfers? I think I saw one and he charges $2,400 per BTC, even though the rate is around $2,100.. why is this? 
@_date: 2017-06-07 18:19:32
I'd be careful. This sounds really sketchy to me
