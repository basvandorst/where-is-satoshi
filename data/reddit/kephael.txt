No way are you going to have a problem in this hypothetical situation when you explain yourself to the police. You wouldn't be able to offer a plausible explanation like in this story where someone is trying to fly across the country with it.

Of course $11,000 is not much money in the scheme of things, but you don't carry it around with you and try to take it to a new bank across the country with it in cash form unless you are A) mentally handicapped, B) doing something illegal, or C) A and B.

You're not trying to fly across the country with it in your carry on luggage though. If you are stopped you have a plausible answer to why you have that much money.

Scientists generally don't make that much.

No one legitimate moves $11,000 in cash in a bag. You get cashier checks at the bank or simply open up another account and move the funds electronically.

You should take a picture of his hardware in the basement or provide any markings on it and we can tell you exactly what it is. Mining hardware is worth quite a bit but quickly loses its value.

This site has been obviously broken for a very long time now. It would take hours of very quick confirming coins to show up, and they would never show as pending in their balance tracker.

Mastercard has a similar policy.

I've seen a KnCMiner Jupiter's 6 pin PCI-Express input melt, burn, and become a fire hazard. No idea what their "engineering" team is up to. But lol at shipping this stuff in this manner.

Digital goods and services are not covered by PayPal's buyer protection policy but you are unable to provide any sort of delivery confirmation for Credit Card disputes, digital goods of large value need to be sold using a money order.

No it wouldn't.

I haven't seen your particular theory presented elsewhere but it seems very plausible.

I happened to read this blog posting earlier today and I think it has some very valid points. 
Why would Google let Uber outdo them in regards to autonomous vehicles? Uber's current offerings seem great, but the idea their taxi service warrants these valuations on the possibility they may be an autonomous vehicle leader harkens back to the days of pets.com.

For Coinbase you can do Level 1 verification which allows you to purchase 10 BTC per day by providing your bank account information (Routing and Account number) and a phone number. The last four digits of your SSN are only required for Level 2 verification. Coinbase is generally the easiest to purchase bitcoins at and sell the bitcoins as they do ACH deposits (in the case of sales) rather than international wire transfers like at bitstamp or mtgox. Bitstamp will require much more personal information from you in comparison to Coinbase.

Time to pull all coins from the site, who knows how many were withdrawn which shouldn't have been. I hope everyone read between the lines of this post and figured out to pull their coins.

This subreddit is turning too much into a "get rich quick scheme" or HYIP. Signs this bubble is going to blow, and soon. I have some JDSU if any wants some.

40% swings in the course of thirty minutes is extremely high risk relative to traditional investments.
