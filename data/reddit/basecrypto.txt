The technical term for this process is "scam".
You cannot send bitcoins to email addresses or phone numbers.

Nice link. Unfortunately, smaller mining rewards make no sense to spend anymore once the transaction fee is higher than the individual reward.
@_date: 2019-06-13 08:34:35
Dealing with fees is a huge mess. But also a general problem and not limited to UI.

Do you mind to elaborate? Are there examples of BIP44 wallets?
Would this be like having multiple HD wallets in one wallet?

Thanks, this is great!

Is there any write-up about this? It seems like a big risk and quite counter intuitive.
@_date: 2019-06-07 05:55:44
Minority chains will disappear. Too risky to share the same hash algorithm.

Have been around but don't remember seeing these warnings. Maybe I just didn't care enough about shitcoins.

It makes sense if you want to keep bitcoin small enough to be able to fully control it.
@_date: 2019-06-07 08:26:33
Use Wasabi wallet!

Sure, a new user will probably first learn about mempools and time transactions accordingly.
More likely the potential user will turn around and leave.
@_date: 2019-06-15 19:26:03
You are too poor for bitcoin.

Price is made based on rumors not based on facts.
I am pretty sure halving will happen and is not a rumor.

Is your node mining? Or managing a lot of transactions?
@_date: 2019-06-16 07:27:13
This is great! It is just missing the little charts and recent change.
@_date: 2019-06-11 06:47:52
No, looks like master public key + 1 private key is enough.
@_date: 2019-06-09 06:33:53
Yes, but unfortunately it also requires lower fees on the mainnet to onboard people.
Since blocks are full, LN adoption has been going down.
@_date: 2019-06-05 21:42:42
Same for me.
@_date: 2019-06-10 21:53:51
A common scenario would be that one reveals a private key of an empty bitcoin address to get access to coins on forked blockchains.
If this compromises your whole HD wallet together with the master public key then it is counterintuitive to most users.
At least it would need some corresponding warning whenever the master public key is displayed.

Which means that the opening channel must spend funds and can never receive more than the amount it spends. 
(without someone else committing funds)
@_date: 2019-06-10 22:19:57
I agree that this would be the right thing to do.
But one could be tempted to be careless with private keys of empty addresses.
@_date: 2019-06-16 12:22:26
In other words: how to cripple bitcoin and keep it small enough that everything can be monitored.
On and off ramps are already controlled.
Now we need to make sure it cannot be used by merchants.
@_date: 2019-06-10 23:01:37


"Intuition" by definition means to make decisions on things you don't know all the details about. And I am pretty sure less than 0.1% of bitcoin users are aware that a **public** master key is risky to share. So it should be warned about.
@_date: 2019-06-15 17:14:11
Dollar cost averaging just assumes that the longterm volatility of bitcoin is smaller than the short term volatility.
Just another way of people claiming to be able to predict the future.
