Lost the majority of my btc (a little over 5btc) to Mt Gox this way. I should have known better, but to be fair I did submit the verification info the same day I deposited and never heard back from them on my verification status (this was around November). I still kick myself for that decision; I bought mine when they were &lt;$100 :(
Lesson learned. My remaining btc are stored in a much safer place.

Yeah, with the high risk transactions, I've seen nothing definitive that indicates what qualifies as high risk or not.
Next time I cash out, I'll be switching to Mt. Gox. As far as I know it's a little harder to get cash in and out, but it's worth not having to deal with this BS.

Feel free to downvote it then. I am sorry for posting when there are a bunch of similar posts. This is mostly just me venting, so if it gets downvoted into oblivion I can live with that.

I just lost $200+ potential profits because of this. They say it's to prevent "fraudulent" transactions, but I think they are trying to prevent themselves from losing money.  Which is understandable from a business perspective, but if that's the case, why are they misrepresenting it? If I were to buy some coins now and in the 5-6 day waiting period the price dropped to $200, would they still cancel it? Something just doesn't seem right about it.

Yeah sorry, I should have explained more clearly. I bought 1.4 btc on the 29th, and that's the transaction that was cancelled. I only mentioned the other transactions because I made them AFTER adding my credit card, and they went through fine. I have feeling that has something to do with it. Overall, I should have had ~3.5 btc, now I have 2.1.
After seeing several other similar posts, I'm beginning to think this whole thing was intentional.
They get an interest free loan (that is if they actually give me a refund, otherwise I would just consider it theft) from me to buy coins at $207 a pop, sell them at $300+, and then cancel the transaction, under the guise that it's "high risk". Like I said, I still haven't received a reply, but it wouldn't surprise me if that's their excuse.

I'm in the exact same situation as you. I noticed something interesting while looking at my coinbase transactions...
Here are 2 transactions I started and what happened.
Transaction 1:
-Oct 29th, I bought 1.4 coins @ $207, for a total of $289.95
-My account WAS NOT verified for instant buy according to the updated requirements.
-Fast forward to Nov 7th, price is now ~$330. A price increase of 60%, total $ profit of $170
-Transaction cancelled
Transaction 2:
-Nov 2nd, I bought 2 coins @ ~$209, for a total of $419.52
-This transaction was made AFTER I updated my account to allow instant purchasing (though it still took 9 days)
-Fast forward to Nov 7th, price increase of 58%, total $ profit of $243
-Transaction NOT canceled
Funds for both transactions were withdrawn from my bank account.
If the price differences are only marginally different between the two transactions, why was one cancelled and the other not?
Here's what I'm thinking. Either:
A) they have a system set in place so that, when there's a big price increase, transactions from unverified (unable to purchase instantly) accounts are cancelled to prevent them from losing money, and they conveniently profit from the price difference between when you send them the money and they.
B) same as above, except they just hold on to your cash for the duration of the 5-6 day period, resulting in no profit. I don't see this as very likely
C) something a little more sinister where they are deliberately manipulating their customers transactions to profit off the price increase.
The "high risk" excuse is bullshit if you ask me. Even though I didn't have my credit card linked to my account for the first purchase, I still have all the other verification information, so how can they say I'm high risk? They withdrew the cash out of my bank account; my side of the transaction was held up, so saying it's high risk is bullshit.
It's just shady IMO, and not a very fair business practice.

I'm kind of inclined to believe this theory over the other one, for the reasons you mentioned. However, I'm hesitant to don my tinfoil hat when there could be a less sinister explanation.
@_date: 2013-11-08 16:29:45
Can you elaborate on how this makes me selfish? Complaining, yeah, I can agree with, but I think this is a perfectly reasonable reaction to getting ripped off.

I've had that exact same experience before, I've been buying small amounts of bitcoins with Coinbase here and there since march. So I have actually benefitted from the 5-6 day delay in the past, and I have also lost insignificant amounts money because of it.
You're may be right about it not being intentional though. It's just my tinfoil hat talking. They could have sort of algorithm that prevent transactions from occurring when the price rises this much. The same thing happened to a lot of people, so I wouldn't be surprised if it's just how their system works. It's still incredibly frustrating though and doesn't account for the lack of communication and no refund.
If do get a refund, I will have lost no money. I was just so excited  with the increasing prices and potential profits I was making, and this just kind of ruined my day.
