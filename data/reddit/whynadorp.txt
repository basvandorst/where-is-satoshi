The agents that scammed him into believing he was hiring murderers are in jail. They could be charged with entrapment and that’s probably also one of the reasons why the murder for hire charges on Ross Ulbricht were dropped. If a crime was committed under entrapment it cannot be prosecuted, I think.

Would be fun to see. Trump is already making a lot to discredit the corporate system by having no filter when he speaks. I know he does it involuntarily, but I like him because of that. All the dirt is coming to the surface thanks to him. He thinks he’s making his own interests and those of his rich friends, but actually he’s a kind of Snowden in disguise to me. Imagine if McAfee was the president. At least he’s slightly more conscious about what he’s doing and he’s a real cowboy  ��
If you want stability of the current system, than of course this makes no sense and it’s better a Hillary Clinton or a Bernie Sanders or an Ocasio-Cortez that will give to the peasants some croissants so that the same peasants will be fucked even harder by the next president. So let’s skip the democrats, let’s aim directly to the apocalypse scenario where the people finally realize how corporations are screwing earth and humanity for their own profit. Crypto will be useful mainly in such a scenario. When rich people will have the means to move to another planet they might not give a fuck about earth and finally destroy it. So let’s take power into our hands before it’s too late.
So, McAfee for president! The dick of McAfee won’t ever fall down!

He doesn’t know the consequences of what he’s doing. He’s the proof that American democracy can be controlled by external forces backed by international capital. The elections were clearly rigged with the help of at least the Russians. Trump’s only interest is to increase his own capital. He doesn’t consider himself an American first, he sees this presidency as an opportunity to get richer and more powerful. So if Putin asks him a favor he’ll do that, because he knows Putin is a stronger ally than American electors. In the meanwhile he’s talking like an hypnotoad and saying whatever people want to hear, he couldn’t care less. He defends America’s interest only when it’s interests of super rich American people. Because they’re his close friends in the same way as Putin and the killer Saudi prince is. 
The good thing is that this is really clear to read because he doesn’t make any effort to hide it/is to stupid and arrogant to cover his ass/American public opinion is retarded. But I still think this is better than having a Clinton up there, because she would do exactly the same while giving some candy to poor American people.
If you believe democracy is the way, then yes, Trump is the enemy and you have to hope that there’s some superhero Democrat that fixes things. Obama didn’t change much and what he did is being crushed relatively easily by this administration.
I’m not American but I’ve the impression American people don’t like socialism. The big American myth is the Free West where everybody is free to shape their life (using brute force and new ideas, like those that brought to the current system). 
Nowadays America is a caricature of this. You had brave cowboys who could live out of nothing and enjoy life in the wilderness. What do you have now? An overweight population on drugs who’s voting a retarded clown as president. Today’s cowboys are big corporations. That means that the individual mostly has to live an alienated life.

I never met Buddha or Jesus and they’re both dead. Let’s try to take the best out of the McAfee kid, the boy has a lot of potential and cash and is much funnier and enlightened than Trump. Honestly, who’d you prefer as president at the moment? That fat idiot clown with a viagra addiction (the puppet of Putin, the cheaper copy of Berlusconi, the retard whose best idea is to waste money in a useless wall) or the guy that swore to eat his dick in the name of crypto? ��

Terminal can be a GUI. One component is a graph and the text is divided in a layout and tabulated, you need some library to do that.
He wrote a python backend and a JavaScript frontend. The library to make the layout is called blessed.

If you’re an anarcocapitalist or whatever, you want to see the crash of the system and not socialists trying to paint over all the corporate dirt with some reforms whose best expected result will be to take power to corporations to give it to bureaucrats. But America doesn’t want and will never be socialist, as this presidency is showing. Democrats can nothing against corporations. Democrats are funded by corporations so they must serve them. They’re fundamentally hypocrites.
Maybe no crash will happen if we manage to control the climate catastrophe ahead and if the current system is kept somehow in balance, but honestly I’d be happy to see the corporate towers collapse and love in a scenario where the individual has more control and freedom. But maybe it’ll take 1000 years or maybe it’ll never happen and we’ll end up in a corporate dystopia.

Yes, they scammed him and he paid about $1.5 million to have 5 or 6 people killed: 
@_date: 2018-07-29 21:08:23
Yes, commissioning a murder is a crime even if the murder doesn’t take place. Many say he didn’t get charged for that because he had a double life without parole anyway and the prosecutors didn’t want to add complexity to the trial (maybe technically the evidence wasn’t strong enough, no idea). He was playing dangerous games and thought he was smart enough to get out of it clean. Many people defend him because he posed as the Robin Hood of drug dealing. He was actually taking a 3-10% cut from each sale and actively trying to involve big time criminals to sell more products at lower prices. I can understand some might judge his intentions as good (he wasn’t selling guns or hits, but he was selling heroin and hard stuff anyway, he wrote that weed was a cheap business for him), but I think he lost control and became a plain criminal.

In the chat transcripts one of the guys was threatening Ulbricht to publish customers names if he didn’t get $500K from Ulbricht. Ulbricht writes to the guy to wait and let him think and in the meanwhile contacts another guy and asks for explanations. This guy was the one that provided the first guy with products and wanted to be paid. He says that the first guy messed up and they already found his partner who ran away with the products and the money and killed him. So Ulbricht asks, hey would you mind also killing this guy that is threatening me, how much will that cost? 150K. Ulbricht pays and sends the bitcoin  transaction number. Then the guy sends a photo of the dead guy. After some other chatting Ulbricht realizes he might need another homicide and the guy convinces him to kill 4 people for a discount price of 500K. Ulbricht pays and sends the transaction number. Then he proposes this guy to sell directly on the Silk Road without using middlemen that mess things up and needs to be killed. After a while the guy says why not, but he needs some money to set up this new business branch. In total Ulbricht sends him 1.5 million and actually nobody was killed and the guy never partnered with him directly on the Silk Road. These chats were taken from Ulbricht’s laptop which he left unlocked while at a public library.
@_date: 2018-07-31 12:40:10
how much are the fees?
@_date: 2018-07-29 20:26:23
That’s what I understood. He got a staged photo that confirmed the first hit and commissioned other 4 murders. He also says once in the past he got another hit for 80K, but it might be he was lying in order to negotiate on the price.
@_date: 2018-07-08 05:29:36
He forked English grammar, so “once and awhile” is also ok. But not always, just once in a while.

@_date: 2018-07-29 19:28:40
Yeah, he was scammed into believing that the people were actually killed and paid 650K for the service. This is in the chat logs and was used in the trial to show what kind of person he became while being an admin of the silk road. You might say these chat logs are fabricated by the investigators, I think they look pretty realistic. They found the chats on his pc that he left unlocked in a public library.
