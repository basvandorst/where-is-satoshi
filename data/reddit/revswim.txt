Look at all the altcoin shills.

I have a bunch of old dust / spam transactions from faucets back in 2013. Can I do anything about this? 10200 bytes for 0.0016 BTC. I know its probably not worth it to even think about but its bitcoin so i want that shit and I dont mind waiting.

Says the spamming troll bot.
@_date: 2017-03-22 12:51:10
This doesn't make any sense.

For what? Leave me alone, you don't need to comment broken English in every thread
@_date: 2017-03-22 07:50:44
yeah but free crypto

I deleted my own post. It doesn't say removed. Troll harder. You could help me fix my problem to prove it's nbd or you could just go around saying fud over and over. 
@_date: 2018-06-13 04:50:08
I'm sorry for your loss
@_date: 2018-06-08 12:33:55
Satoshi took extreme caution to hide his identity. No, he's not showing back up to pump some random shitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 23:14:15
If you are worried about the faucet recording your IP you could use tor or a vpn
@_date: 2017-11-03 15:42:15
Bitcoin was created so you wouldn't have to deal with those monsters anymore.

I want one of these but I come from a Zojirushi family.

You have one Bitcoin on both chains. You use a faucet or buy more bitcoin from someone only supporting one side of the fork. Check the block explorer to make certain that you have one bitcoin on one chain and more than one bitcoin on the other chain. Send more than one bitcoin to new wallet. Transaction gets rejected by the chain where you only have one bitcoin. Coins successfully split.

Evidence?

This won't happen to me with a yubikey and authy, right?

I wish I could. If you find one, let me know. Leaning towards Mexico because you can just bribe everyone

Stay up to date with the latest tech coming out for Bitcoin. Lightning Network, Mimble Wimble, RSK. There is a lot of fud right now from people who don't understand that bitcoin is THE cryptocurrency to own. They want to sell you Scrotum Coin or some other junk just because the price is low. They are going to miss the rocket to the moon because they are too busy collecting rocks. Help them if they can be helped. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 15:34:31
I wonder why those guys were banned.

I'll look into it. I learned a weird conspiracy type connection just now. Brock Pierce is on the Bitcoin Foundation, people resigned because of his criminal record. He's one of the subjects of a documentary called Open Secret about Hollywood underage sex abuse. Also connections to the Clinton Global Initiative. Idk if thats too far down the rabbit hole. Sorry for going all conspiratorial, OP. I'll take this to Above Top Secret or something

Oh I think the loss of privacy would be from transferring all your coins in one transaction. In modern wallets it generates a new wallet address for each deposit to protect privacy. If you sent all your coins to a new address, all the transactions previously on separate addresses would all become linked and if any of the previous transactions were connected to your identity, they all could be. This happens any time you consolidate multiple inputs into a single output. With coin control you could pick which wallets to send from if you wanted to avoid those risks.

Bitcoin can be used to make things. Mostly shitty altcoins tho.

Some people have to stay on earth. You can be like mission control.
@_date: 2017-11-03 03:56:53
Thanks, your post seems interesting. I'd love to hear more about your theories. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 19:36:39
Yeah 
It's under Natural Replay Protection. You don't have to use a whole bitcoin, I just suck at examples

Okay, we are friends now. Want to hang out later?

So what is the solution if it's not increased block size? I'm not a technical expert. I'm hoping people smarter than me can figure this out because it's annoying having to look stuff up and calculate fees when I'm sending.
@_date: 2017-05-04 04:41:49
NP, I just wanted an excuse to say "absconded."  I saw someone in another thread say it and it sounded cool.
@_date: 2017-05-04 04:31:41
Exchanges have tons of coins, making them a target. Also some popular exchanges in the past have stopped all withdraws and absconded with customer funds.

I'm doing something very similar. I want to add a receipt printer to print out paper wallets. Maybe a touchscreen and a handheld case for it all.

I'm up over $1k after spending a few hundred bucks and then using some of the crypto. I guess it was mostly from ethereum. I was in for a few hundred bucks in half Ether half btc, now I have over a thousand of various cryptos. Soon hopefully more. Maybe not Lambo money but at least vacation money. I bought in when btc was overtaking gold, an all time high and I'm still up a good amount. This is my second time buying in, last time it paid for a vacation too. People are always discouraging this but I've already almost spent more USD of the crypto than I've invested. It's free money, am I not meant to be ranting about it 24/7? I don't think anyone knows that it's too late to get a Lambo. What kind of gains would we see if crypto even came close to replacing gold or fiat? We haven't seen widescale adoption yet
