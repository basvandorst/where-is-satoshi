I think I was using an outdated version of pywallet possibly.
Use the one on 
This version asked me for my passphrase

Not yet, still working on it. I did manage to recover the wrong wallet though lol. I'll try again when I get home

I bought a BFL 5gh/s miner.. I don't "regret" my decision but I am just glad I didn't buy one of the larger ones. I ordered mine last april and it just arrived like a week ago. It just doesn't make sense to buy one right now at the price they're selling. I'd love to have a bunch of miners running but your money would be much better spent on investing in bitcoin right now.

I actually wrote in last week saying they should do a podcast on it and gave them a few research resources, awesome! It's probably been requested a lot, but hopefully it gave them enough of a push to do it. I'm excited to listen to this one :)

How the hell am I egocentric?
If you payed this guy whatever and it 100% guaranteed you to get a job, that is "buying your way in". But you can't do that. CV's list a persons experience. If you use this service and your only experience is working at mcdonalds for example, and your competition is someone who has certifications, a diploma, and job experience..who are they going to hire?
Why am I even bothering explaining this, lol

Good stuff, I ordered mine last april and they've shipped out upto march 21 for the jalapenos. I am Canadian though and I am really wondering if there's going to be duty. :(

I just signed up with VoS and bought $100 of bitcoin, am very pleased. They will have a bill payment system up soon, looking forward to that.

What the hell?? I just got verified and did a BMO cash deposit on Saturday and I was very pleased with it. This is really disappointing. :(
I hope they bring the bill payments up soon..

I actually have two raspberry pi's, one is a media server and one is just sitting around. Finally, get to put the second one to work!

Vault of Satoshi verified me in a few hours, probably like 5 hours. It was amazing, I recommend VoS

can I catch a rising knife?

I'm kind of new to bitcoin, I'm wondering how do you actually go about paying someone in person with bitcoin? I have bitcoin-qt, I don't understand how I can pay someone in person. Do I need an app on my phone? I have an iphone btw, maybe you can help me learn? :)

Let's just say you could go to wal-mart and buy a miner. By the time this actually happened, the difficulty would be so insanely high that this would never profit.

Are you asking how strong your wallets password is? 
@_date: 2013-11-19 23:48:13
cool, appreciate the reply
@_date: 2013-12-01 19:57:23
That was an excellent explanation, and the number of suns needed is  hilarious :D

I remember someone saying they did a trade in person and the person who recieved cash for bitcoins got counterfit bills. be careful and please educate yourself on how to tell real bills apart from fake ones. Personally, I don't know how to tell the difference but I am sure the info is out there. :)

Applying to a job is a competition though, many people apply for one position and only one person will get that job.
