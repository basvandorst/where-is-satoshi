I shall indeed! It's going to be a few months, right now it's sitting in storage as the blizzard overtakes us. HODL!

Yes, it's a 30 year old Four Winns Vista 315. She's an old boat, but well maintained and in good shape. It's not an extravagant purchase; I'm not buying a million dollar yacht, but it's pretty substantial for me. It's the largest boat I've ever owned, and I wanted to name it something clever that would be a conversation starter and show my appreciation for the technology and community that gave me such an opportunity.

I got my first boat a few years ago and learned the lesson of buying a damn Bayliner (abused 80's vintage). I didn't know you could make cardboard boats, but wow. I've worked my way up, buying old boats cheap in the fall, fixing them up over the winter and selling in the spring for a small profit. Thanks to come hard work and some luck with Bitcoin I'm able to get "a boat that doesn't suck" and that's a pretty big step for me.
If you're ever in the SW Michigan area (Grand Haven) stop on by. You're welcome aboard anytime! :) I'm always eager to learn new things from someone who has gone ahead and made the mistakes before.
Thank you!

Cool! :)
Now, how to get from Grand Haven, MI to Nola without having to deal with an ocean......hmmmmm I seem to remember you guys having a rather substantial river that ends down there. I wonder how close it gets to here?

Aaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh, thank you :)

The weekly limit is a damn lie. They told me $300 for weeks and I ground my way through it. I finally get there, and they say to wait. It's currently DOWN to 44 days. I am seriously pissed about them not telling me up front about it.

Oh I certainly agree. I'm accustomed to painful and expensive learning curves (comes with my day job), which is why I'm smart enough to know that I'm not yet smart enough to do this. Hence the original question. :)
For now I just wanna pop a little wheelie.
