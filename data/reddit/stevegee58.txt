There have been some recent court decisions in the US where the cops need a warrant to touch your car without your knowledge.  This includes GPS trackers and even putting chalk marks on your tires.

The only way the IRS knows you're trading crypto is if your broker submits a 1099-K.  Period.
They only issue a 1099-K if you cross certain thresholds such as &gt; $20,000 gross proceeds or &gt; 200 transactions.
Logically if the broker issued a 1099-K and you didn't report it on your 1040 then the IRS would send you a letter informing you to submit an amended return to account for it.

That's always been my main philosophical objection to LN: It's not real until it's on the blockchain.  Yes it \*eventually\* ends up on the blockchain but I guess I'm just an old BTC fogey.
My understanding is LN consists of a bunch of IOUs (contracts) held in channels.  But until Granny Smith can understand it I'll keep hodling.

Bisq is quickly becoming the go-to for crypto-fiat exchanges.   After all, why take something that's decentralized and centralize it at a KYC exchange?  Keep it decentralized like it was meant to be.

Just because you make money doing something doesn't make you a professional.
@_date: 2019-11-09 21:14:57
No.  Doing something to make money is a job.  Professional implies a level of expertise, specific training, education, certification, etc.
e.g. Burger flippers aren't professionals.

Any US exchange that deals in USD is required to meet KYC rules.  There are no US based competitors to go to that don't enforce KYC.
I guess if you're desperate you can move your BTC to some Russian or Ukrainian exchange. :D

Unless you're running Linux, appimage won't work (easily).  If you're on Windows just download the installer from [electrum.org]( (after making sure you're really on that site!).

Is it in the Coinbase transaction log?  If so, what's the txid?
Look [here]( and you'll see that the BTC network is becoming quite congested with unconfirmed transactions and higher than normal fees.

Assuming you're looking to move BTC from Coinbase, etc don't rush into it.  Figure out your cold storage strategy, then wait until things calm down.  Right now transactions are taking longer than usual and the fees are very high.

Imagine mining a shitton of BTC on a cheap-ass graphics card back in 2012 when BTC was like $20.

Would you sell?

I knew this guy that underwent open heart surgery.  The surgery went fine but he couldn't remember \*any\* of his passwords for anything.  Turns out that general anesthesia and heart bypass machines can cause amnesia.
Luckily he could reset most of his online passwords through customer service calls.  Unfortunately he didn't paper back up the keys for his whole-drive encrypted laptop so for that he was screwed.  Same would go for cryptocurrency wallets.
The lesson is to have keys written down somewhere safe and have a trusted individual remember where they are for you, just in case.

Think about it.  If they have to ask you to divulge information voluntarily then they don't know.

There's more than one way to laminate paper.  The cheap and reliable way I do it is by covering the paper with clear packing tape, both sides.  Then trim off the excess tape.  Works fine, no heat no expense.

Some Electrum servers became a vector for a phishing attack but that's been fixed in later versions.  There was a recent DDOS attack against servers but that has been mitigated as well.

Did you download the client from [bitcoin.org](  If so then it's a full node.  How long has it been running?  The blockchain is currently about 200 GB so it takes a long time to download.  Maybe your node isn't finished syncing so your transaction hasn't been downloaded to the client yet.
@_date: 2019-04-23 16:18:05
Fees are way above average right now.  You should always check what the prevalent fees are before doing a transaction to see if the Electrum suggested fees make sense.
e.g. check here: [ fees are the second graph down.  Also the unconfirmed transaction count is very telling about how long your transaction will take to get 1 confirmation.
If the transaction has 0 confirmations you can cancel and resend with a higher fee.

I'm assuming you're in the US.
* Coinbase is probably the easiest path.  They've been around a while and are well established.
* Moving your BTC off the poker site is a good idea in general.  I suggest a thin client like Electrum.
* To convert 0.25 BTC to USD you don't have to transfer to your wallet first.  When you open your Coinbase (or whatever) account you'll have BTC addresses you can send to.  Just send straight from the poker site to that address.  To be safest, try transferring like 0.01 BTC first to make sure you have everything straight.
* Coinbase and other US exchanges require lots of ID from you to meet their KYC requirements.  You'll have to provide a pic of your driver's license, etc and it takes a few days (i.e. not instant).  You'll also have to link your bank account to Coinbase.
* Again since it's your first transaction I suggest sending a small amount of USD from Coinbase to your bank just to make sure everything's legit.
* Taxes: US Exchanges are only required to report your selling of BTC for USD if it exceeds $20,000.  If it's less than that then the IRS won't know about it unless you tell them on your tax return.  You're still legally obligated to declare the sale of an asset on your tax return.  You'll have to figure out if it's a short-term or long-term capital gain (or loss).  The gain (or loss) occurs the second the exchange converts from BTC to USD, not when it's transferred to the bank.
@_date: 2019-05-11 10:34:57
I understand your sentiment but OP wanted to convert about $1500 worth of BTC and never did it before.  CB is easiest and not a scam.
I hadn't thought of Coinbase banning gamblers.  Do they really do that?  If so OP might have to go the localbitcoins or bisq route.
(Edit) Fuck you're right.  Coinbase specifically excludes gambling.  OP will have to find another method.  Coinbase may even trace the deposit on the blockchain further back than your wallet to see where it comes from.
@_date: 2019-05-01 00:52:36
I don't know if you've ever run a full node before (I have) but it's a hassle.  Right now the blockchain is over 200 GB and it takes a long time to download.  Once the initial download is done you can either leave the client running all the time or just run the client when you want to do a transaction.  If you do the latter you'll have to wait for the blockchain to catch up before sending or receiving BTC which can take a while depending on how long since you ran it last.
With thin clients like Electrum someone else runs the full node and you route your transactions through it.  You just fire up Electrum, do your transaction and close it again, no delays.
