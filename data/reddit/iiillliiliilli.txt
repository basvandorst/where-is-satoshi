nope - look up the bacterial cell wall. not the same as plants, but still called and considered a cell wall.

sure, but one chain can go down or both could go down. or both could go up. or whatever. my point was not about the opportunities in this event. it was that it is a higher risk period (which goes with a chance of more gains and losses). and as an advice for a beginner, I would stay out of those periods until the beginner feels comfortable and understands what's going on.

just as a general advice: if you're starting with investing right now - wait a week or two. right now it's quite turbulent and risky. you could make use of the lower price and earn more, but you could also get unlucky and buy at a high price for a long low to come. nobody knows. but if you're just starting, I would give it a little bit more time and start at not so turbulent times.

yes - no matter what you think of it technically,  lots of people are nervous about it. this could be a great chance to get cheap btc, but could also make things worse in the future. 
people will tell you that you should go for it because you can make more money. they are right. but as it's the nature of investing, more money means more risk. you have to decide if you want to take it. my general advice is: start with low risk trades. learn the system and give yourself time. don't fall for the FOMO (fear of missing out - read it up on wikipedia!) - it is a dangerous path in cryptos (there is always a "great", "one time" opportunity).
