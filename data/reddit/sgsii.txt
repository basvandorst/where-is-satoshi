My company has recently released a easy-to-use mobile payment solution that they could easily slightly change to process Bitcoin payments. After all, my company did help develop Google Wallet. Why can't they do this?
EDIT: I am not only talking about mobile payments either.

Former BofA Merchant Services Rep here... 
Deposit Holds are delays to the availability of a portion of deposited checks. They occur infrequently and if you receive one, you will receive a notice with the reason and the new date the funds will be available. The date on the Hold notice will replace the Credit Pending date for that portion of the deposit. Please refer to the Deposit Agreement for more details. 
Situations that typically cause a check to be held include: 
The check is for an amount larger than you normally deposit 
The source of the check (for example, a personal check is more likely to be held than a government check) 
We suspect that we cannot collect the funds from the account the check is drawn on 
Previous overdrafts from this account. 
ACH just stands for Automated Clearing House which is not necessary to know about, to understand why something has a hold on it.

What I mean is does anyone think the US is going to make a hard effort (more than in the past) to shut down BTC for its citizens. I'm just curious what the general concensus on this is since it is being valued even more recently.

Ask your Lasik provider if they will accept Bitcoin!
