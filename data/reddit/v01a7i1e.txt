Volume during the period the reference rate is determined for the futures contract will very likely increase significantly as professionals with open arbitrage positions will attempt to both replicate and potentially manipulate the reference price. CBOE reference price is auction at Gemini.

It doesn't matter if you think people should because market forces are going to drive them to do that over next 10 years.
Given choice between 2 employers who offer same job for same total cost to them, gross pay, then which will people choose? Because in net pay the untaxed money will be 2x the taxed pay. 
So then after he takes the untaxed job, like working for a DAO somewhere, which merchants will he use if again offered the choice?

My post in r/BitcoinMarkets has some details to help explain what is happening. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 06:18:41
LN seems to have some very very interesting ideas that could potentially scale very well just like IP networks have.
However there are some devil in the details stuff like this which is making me nervous, mostly because I don't understand exactly what the protocol will be but also because I see there being a possibility for permission based links and some potential for harmful feedback dynamics. 
Imagine we have these high connectivity and high value nodes which add some type of custom requirements to open a channel with them, not a public protocol but something else, like a payment, a restriction around public IP origins, a special token you have to present perhaps they issue after your identity is confirmed as a node operator who knows. 
So since the LN fees you collect are effectively like interest payments that are determined by how *useful* your node is in facilitating transactions then I think it will create a feedback loop that will make only highly connected nodes with large numbers of channels to other highly connected nodes the most rewarded nodes which result in the network being very concentrated, simply because the smaller players won't have enough capital to have many channels and won't end up being used in routes and therefore won't earn the LN fees and won't be profitable. A simple analogy would be compounding interest on large deposits but where the interest rate increases the larger your deposit, this will result in a rapid increase in disparity with only a few large accounts as the final result. 
If you combine these two points together then LN might not be a great solution when measured against decentralization and permission-less / uncensored access objectives. I don't know for sure and I am planning to run nodes on testnet early in Jan and also will look into any possible analysis of potential feedback effects and implications for the dynamic evolution of the structure of LNs. 
Thank you for your correspondence and assistance.

My post in r/BitcoinMarkets has some details to help explain what is happening. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:25:37
ok thanks. I might hire some people and just do it because this fee situation is officially a nightmare. Of course how to get people to join in is the big question. 
On a different topic how will fees work? If I run my node I set a fee? or how will competition work to have fees. I'm assuming the channel open transaction needs to be confirmed on chain first and that has a miner fee, but what about fees for lightning transactions themselves?
Lastly related to fees, I was thinking what happens if your channel balance gets lower than an on chain tx fee amount? Then can you can never close the channel, perhaps on chain tx fees suddenly spike after you open it for example. But will the protocol know that or there will be these zombie channels all over in that case. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:57:05
While I absolutely agree with you. It doesn't mean he will never miss an important point. In regards to the futures I have a concern. 
Anyone who has a few minutes I respectfully ask you read my recent post:
@_date: 2017-12-14 19:15:12
Anyone who is a maker not a taker does. Do the math if a company pays salary of $90k+ to an employee the employee end up with around $65K cash in their hand and the cost to the company after paying ALL taxes like payroll, unemployment insurance, medicare, social security, will work out to be about $130K paid out from company cash. That is 50% tax on the most productive members of society, the upper middle
class. taxes on companies is not an argument that is the tax on employees they just use propaganda ro try and say it is a tax on *the company not you*, nonsense people are the company. fwiw know these numbers very well with my experiences as an employer. they are correct. 
But you are correct in that most people are taking net money on income taxes from the government, more than 1/2 the population. US is socialism in disguise or socialism light and along with western europe will be in for a very very rude awakening when the revenge of capitalism strike via cryptocurrencies. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:07:53
Actually that is very very interesting point. Thank you!! 
But does Poloniex has a BTC/USD? I think only USDT maybe which has you relying on trusting tethers.
The spread between the BTC/USDT on Poloniex and the spot exchanges that are part of the futures reference price is perhaps very important to watch! 
@_date: 2017-12-19 00:55:44
I think that was very intentional and I think it wasn't always consistent which suggests to me they attempted to make it look that way and would make mistakes occasionally.

This volume will increase significantly now there is a future but will increase the most at the reference price auction
@_date: 2017-12-13 00:41:38
Do you like paying income taxes? Because part of the idea was if you had censorship resistance on payments side then that reduces the power of government via reducing their effectiveness at levies like income and sales taxes. Of course we are also missing anonymity features but early on the expectation was there could be effective solutions for that on top of the base system. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 13:25:30
As I understand LN currently I think the two big problems with it, when measured against the goals of decentralization and uncensored money, are the discovery or channel initialization mechanism and then the utility feedback dynamic that will organically create concentration.
If special nodes that have high levels of channel connectivity add prerequisites to connect to them for example then they can easily become censorship mechanisms, that is the first problem. 
Because LN fees are like interest payments and your node will earn this interest based on how many transactions are routed via your node, which makes sense, however you can model it as an interest rate percentage that increases with the size of the deposit. That would mean the larger nodes will earn all the profits also when measured as a fraction of their capital, which if that will be true will lead to a concentration of nodes with large deposits and small nodes will not be profitable or serve a purpose.
I have no issue with Bitcoin supporting the operation of such a technology as LN but I am not able to yet understand how it will promote decentralization and censorship resistance which are my preferred goals.
  
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:20:29
Well hypocritically it would clear all the current unconfirmed transactions in about 8 hours at 2x or 4 hours at 4x.
I'm not saying I don't see your points they have validity however for people like me we really need  solutions tomorrow or we will need to abandon using Bitcoin and doing that will mean we will need to liquidate some into other coins. That is probably going to cause price drop temporarily at least. We actually honestly really need an uncensored private currency for real economic reasons, believe it or not. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 15:48:49
But don't you have concerned around how it will create higher reward percentages for higher level of capital? That would seem to eventually eliminate small nodes from being profitable, no? 
@_date: 2017-12-28 16:47:49
Traditionally cryptocurrency cypherpunks don't assume to be able to harness any motivations other than greed. 
What I am starting to think about is could one design a LN inspired network that adds some type of incentives which will work to promote decentralization and censorship resistance explicitly. 
For example redesign LN as an auto mixer/tumbler system where the routing algorithm isn't purely shortest/cheapest path and the fees get distributed in a way that small nodes are rewarded explicitly for providing obfuscation perhaps. This flavor of LN would probably be pretty popular as it would give close to instant payments but also anonymity and decentralization improvements. 
LN feels like it is the tip of the iceberg of a bunch of neat possibilities but yet not currently designed with the objectives I mention as the primary objectives. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:17:20
If they have been acquiring large quantities of coins in spot markets and they simultaneously sell those on spot and sell futures ... you are correct they can cause a panic and crash the market. Having those large amounts of coins is critical and remember they needed to pay on spot with the full amount of fiat, that is a lot of hard fiat cash to hit the BRR exchanges. Perhaps that is what just happened. 
I will add a second more detailed reply to your concerns when I have a little more time. 
I think you MIGHT have reasons to be concerned I need to re-read your comment. However I also think it can fail if we see B &lt; 0 leading markets lower because we can know they don't have enough of the coins. If spot exchanges lead prices lower ... then the moves are more likely to be "real" imho. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 02:57:18


I'm very interested in running these and I am starting to look into it. Here is my basic understanding
1. fund your node with X coins for a max time T by opening a channel to some other node(s). There needs to be an on chain transaction that does this
2. earn some income by collecting small fees on LN transactions that flow through you
3. When you need to turn off your node. Close your channels which will generate a close transaction.
Is this roughly correct? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:40:52




Many of biggest holders didn't acquire their coins via KYC/AML channels like Coinbase. They mined them or acquired them much earlier. Some of those holder probably would be willing to sell some at $18K however exactly your point is probably what is preventing those coins showing up as offers on Coinbase. So ironically these very regulations intended to constrain it are probably helping fuel the rise. Without capital gains taxes and KYC tracking sellers would arrive by now.




Ideally we should keep this somewhat quiet but wtf lets just tell you. 2nd layer solutions will make Bitcoin an unbeatable payment system able to scale well beyond even Visa levels. Additionally they will add massive improvements in anonymity. LNs are embedding full onion routing and anonymity. Bitcoin will go dark/untraceable overnight, perhaps CT or some other upgrades, which don't worry miners will gladly embrace as it will make their rewards and fees even more valuable as untraceable, and yeah ... I don't think governments will be getting income or capital gains taxes in that type of monetary technology. 
So if you are some type of government loving nipple sucker you might want to go suck hard while it lasts because your momma about to get brutally axed. I'm just saying lets slow it down a little so they don't even know it before it is really too late for them to even scream!

Something like this. Do you know if anyone has any source code for bitgold? If we could find Szabo written source code it would help.

@_date: 2017-12-27 03:24:50
Great! Thank you. 
Two followup questions:
How can I maximize the likelihood I get transactions routed through me?
To make this profitable I just need to ensure the LN fees I collect exceeds the open + close on chain tx costs and any operating costs of the node, is that also roughly correct? 
@_date: 2017-12-18 18:23:54
That's what I personally suspect. Also the winXP oddness is interesting. I don't know if we can find source code from Bitgold anywhere because then we can see if it is conceivable that Nick's coding has a roughness like Satoshi. I think he already knew Hal and really relied heavily on his more advanced coding, debugging and testing skills. Satoshi almost seemed to not be comfortable in debuggers and with core dumps from what I have read. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:22:36
I suspect a lot of it is coming from high net worth individuals and family offices and also some hedge funds. 
But those are all very different from big banks and PPT they actually need and want to hold bitcoin most likely. 
Also remember you can't currently short in spot markets by borrowing. We don't have BTC lending desks ... yet. So part of your original idea is very risky because lets say you wire all this money to accumulate spot coins so you can later sell them during momentum ignition. Well you have an average purchase price of all your purchases and potential if the momentum is very strong you might loose a massive amount as the value of your coins drops so fast resulting in a lower sell price than buy price which okay maybe your short futures makes up for ... however just hoping you can hammer futures and everyone will follow is just all around an easier and more straightforward thing. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 22:03:08
While I don't know. If you have a few minutes please read my post in regards to the technicalities around cash fiat settled futures and what implications they have in terms of arbitrage strategies and the potential for large disconnects between spot and futures prices.
@_date: 2017-12-19 00:58:02
But slightly less sloppy than Szabo's probably because Hal was fixing it some in their shared identity. 
Does anyone have code we can confirm Szabo wrote himself? I bet it is in C and a little C++ but with an academic flavored like roughness.

Thanks for pointers so far.
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:31:44
Good post, however I respectfully disagree about cash settlement not being important. 
Cash settlement makes the basis less stable and reliable as it make the arbitrage strategies more complex require more capital and no longer risk free which makes the relationship between S and F less convergent and due to a **lower amount of stabilizing arbitrage generated order flow**. 
Check out my most recent post with links to earlier posts if you want to hear more about what I am saying.
TL;DR when the basis B is large positive or negative then futures price moves upwards and downwards respectfully are less reliable indicators of true market forces. Price moves confirmed by corresponding spot moves are hard to ignore.
 
@_date: 2017-12-15 00:54:56
I was wondering if there is any possibility of building a system where users could somehow sponsor financially a specific upgrade/bip
For example let's say we all *donate* to some type of bounty address that only get's released and payed out on a specific upgrade occurring, let's say the most popular opinion is 4mb blocksize. Then the reward is paid to the miners for the next 100 or however many blocks after the upgrade is "confirmed".  I have no idea how this could be setup but I could see it being a very effective system for users to influence the BIP/upgrades that occur. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 05:10:38

Let's hope he got out as the hackers warned him. 
That's what the hacker said on P2P Foundation (he hacked his account on the website too and used it to publish this) :
"Dear Satoshi. Your dox, passwords and IP addresses are being sold on the darknet. Apparently you didn't configure Tor properly and your IP leaked when you used your email account sometime in 2010. You are not safe. You need to get out of where you are as soon as possible before these people harm you. Thank you for inventing Bitcoin."
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:40:40
The influx of new buyers that decide to buy in the futures certainly might overwhelm sellers and that is the upwards case I explain, where we see large positive B which in a physically delivered futures market can be arbitraged away with a risk free strategy of selling futures and buying spot, but in these contracts will not be risk free and therefore not possible to execute.
But excluding an arbitrage strategy that would in a physically delivered contract be available to hodlers is my concern. This strategy is widely utilized by professionals operators in many many situations and provides upwards buying pressure when futures prices lead prices lower, when B is negative. Normally this strategy is available to holders of an asset or commodity and provides from the perspective of maintenance or growth of a net long position risk free additional income! 
Imagine you own 40,000 bitcoins currently and have decided you will maintain this position or grow it during the time horizon longer than the expiration of the physically delivered future. Then when B is a large negative you simply simultaneously buy futures and sell your coins on spot, you will earn the basis B and eventually post expiration have exactly the same number of coins. **However with these futures at expiration you will only have cash fiat USD according to the BRR(CME) or Gemini(CBOE) reference rates which in order to get back those 40,000 coins you need to wire the fiat back to the spot exchanges and buy them again!**This is both risky and expensive!
**PREDICTION** we will see massive jumps in spot Bitcoin prices in BRR and Gemini immediately post expiration. This will cause losses to any HOLDERs who have attempted this long futures arbitrate trade while using cash settled futures! Sophisticated operators already know this and won't be participating! 
@_date: 2017-12-28 15:47:30
Yeah I don't think it exists in any code currently but discovery and negotiation around channel creation is very mysterious to me currently. If somehow the protocol could build in a permission-less negotiation system that could easy my concerns on this permission based hubs forming.

Any thoughts on my 2 big concerns with LN in previous comment? Thanks for any help in understanding. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:17:35
The big message I hope we can get out is that if everyone blindly follows futures prices assuming they are real or fair then it enables momentum igniting type strategies by those who don't have coins but have fiat. 
I personally don't think big banks or PPT have coins, I think they are late and also getting their hands on real coins requires wiring full fiat to these antiestablishment spot Bitcoin exchanges, whereas getting clearing margins at CBOE and CME is much much easier, but to explain that we need to do a full additional post to explain tier 1 banks, capital ratios, FED and other central bank lending windows, and last VaR risk reports! Nasty stuff but most simple version is not all fiat is created equal and money wired to spot exchanges is more real actually for banks and PPT than money held on margin at the CCHs on the securities side.
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:41:43
Oh I agree that segwit plus LN is absolutely the best answer to scaling. 
However I ask about factors of 2 or 4 and you reply talking about a factor of 100. How is that relevant to the immediate situation? 
I discovered Bitcoin in late 2011 and have been following it and even using it in all sorts of ways since then and something seems seriously wrong with the extreme positions taken in this blocksize shitshow. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 23:58:04
For the meantime, what do you think is the best altcoin to adopt for day to day use as a currency? 
I'm leaning towards either Litecoin. But really any of dash, xmr, ltc, or even eth or etc could make sense. We need something for $5-100 range that can work for now. Bitcoin is kinda broken for what a lot of people rely on using it for, transacting with each other. 
As much as we love Bitcoin and believe in LN we are all having logistical issues here trying to transact with each other, does that make sense? 
@_date: 2017-12-18 18:19:03

@_date: 2017-12-10 06:41:50
With cash settled futures both pure arbitrage trades are no longer pure. The way to understand this is that in a deliverable futures market the arb has 2 simultaneous legs whereas in cash settled this becomes 3 legs with the final transaction occurring at expiration in spot. 
The additional third leg has frictional and statistical risks. It requires execution at exactly the cash settlement reference price in the spot market for exactly the quantity required. This may or may not be possible. 


Here you are closing the arb at time 1. The issue is you are assuming S that you sell the spot at is the same S you settle the future at. With physically delivered futures there is no transaction in spot the arb is locked it. 
The risk is that you will not be able to sell at a better or matching price to the futures settlement price in spot when selling your coins. 
A lot of effort will be put by trading firms to figure out how to execute as closely as possible to the BRR (CME) and Gemini (CBOE) reference prices exactly at expiration.
@_date: 2017-12-13 00:36:29
Can you recommend one that doesn't need KYC? It would be extremely useful actually.
However as someone who did my first Bitcoin transaction in March, 2012. Its pretty depressing to have to seriously consider finding someone to use Visa because one part of the original idea was to route around existing payment networks. The dream was a store of value and a payment system.
Not that I need this because I don't don this. But as a simple example, people could use it for Hookers and Blow, which using a Visa maybe they kinda don't feel comfortable I guess.

My interpretation is that he is giving a clue that he might believe even Core is infiltrated as I do. I think there is a conspiracy and that some of the key players are compromised by western intelligence agencies.

Perhaps trying to cripple it at 7 tps on chain forever is a agenda pushed by these intelligence agencies Andreas is talking about.

So any linear blockchain simply can't scale to Visa level transactions which is what we need but actually even orders of magnitude more than that. So a LN type network of clearing network is clearly the ideal solution because it scales probably almost exponentially I think. 
This quote from LN paper is my favorite to remind people: 
"If we use an average of 300 bytes per bitcoin transaction and assumed unlimited block sizes, an equiva- lent capacity to peak Visa transaction volume of 47,000/tps would be nearly 8 gigabytes per Bitcoin block, every ten minutes on average. Continuously, that would be over 400 terabytes of data per year."
So any altcoin that somehow can do scaling with decentralization and be a store of value that would probably end Bitcoin. 
The issue is what should we do tomorrow. I have actual real business problems currently that relied on having a cryptocurrency to use for payments and up until 8 months ago it was fine but as of today I'm basically stuck. 
I have a feeling the rise in Litecoin prices is directly connected to this issue. Bitcoin believers like myself who are actually "stuck" so we are shifting some amount into Litecoin to use for payments we need to make. The type of payments where an $11 tx fee is simply impossible as it makes the payment non justified economically.

I never said taxes aren't good. Local taxes are what pays for most of what you mention. 
Income taxes are bad. They are to enable the violence of the nationstate and are needed to make the fiat money system sustained at all.
