Haha yea, short but good life

Most of the people in crypto trading have very short memory lol

Once you in, only bancruptcy can stop you ��
@_date: 2017-12-21 14:04:22
If he would say otherwise it would be like admitting to be guilty. Sooner or later this guy will face serious legal problems
@_date: 2017-12-25 07:46:13
Example of idiotism
@_date: 2017-12-24 19:44:55
This is Cryptoooo!
@_date: 2017-03-19 11:46:06
so long? fuk it will destroy the price of BTC 
@_date: 2017-03-14 11:17:38
Can you explain more with electrum? I am kinda newb here
@_date: 2017-03-14 13:15:44
In this case alt coins shoulg go even more higher
@_date: 2017-03-14 14:41:09
Thanks, pretty clear. And how that broadcast is performed technically? 


I assume that the scenario of both coins keep existing also possible as ETH and ETC?
@_date: 2017-03-17 14:09:42
Tried to avoid monotony
@_date: 2017-03-13 12:31:31
Thanks for your review. And what do you think which  option will be adopted in long run: BU or Segwit? I understand that segwit supporters core principle is to make it safe and dont make mistakes, Why BU do not accept their model? Is there any gain for moners in BU? I assume they want the transfer prices to increase to grow their profits?
@_date: 2017-03-03 09:48:35
Yes, solved it thanks!
@_date: 2017-03-10 21:10:07
My advice keep calm, in long run BTC will make those jerks regret this, BTC is bigger and they fear of it
@_date: 2017-03-17 06:43:14
When it will finally happen and will be closed deal and move on with BTC being great again, because currently all those alt coins thinking that they are super better than BTC... 
@_date: 2017-03-14 10:25:38
No i dont have 120 gb... 
@_date: 2017-03-14 05:39:54
Thanks for vert explanatory reply, looks like we are dealing with interesting situation, I hope it will end best for bitcoin irself but not for miners. I think sooner or later it has to get rid of gready miners, it will be best in long run. Greed is aleats first step to failure.
By the way, if HF happens, what happens to ordinary users who have bitcoins? Do they have to do anthing? How to know after the HF on what side you are?
@_date: 2017-03-14 12:01:06
What about hard wallets like ledger, if for example you have bitcoins there, do you need to do anything more than keeping safe your private keys? Lets say HF occurs, there are two coins, and one of them dies after some time, what you need to do then with you coins in ledger? For examplw had BTC and it died and left BTU...
@_date: 2017-03-17 13:57:33
you see it right, sad that there is still more people thinking differently
@_date: 2017-03-15 05:34:59
Thanks, understood
@_date: 2017-03-15 11:06:37
Thanks for info
@_date: 2017-03-03 05:47:23
No chance to cancel? Fuk that
@_date: 2017-03-05 10:04:54
But you have to pay tax only when you sell and get fiat money? For example if i bouhgt some bitcoin several years ago and still hold them so i do not have to pay anything?
@_date: 2017-03-28 16:22:23
Copy down your private keys and try to import them to newly downliaded electrum
@_date: 2017-03-11 09:30:41
Thanks for review, I am thinking to buy it, sounds good
@_date: 2017-03-28 09:25:31
Use electrum, much better wallet
@_date: 2017-03-14 11:56:25
Thats what i am gonna do lol
@_date: 2017-03-17 13:56:31
The same thinking was when it cost 2 dollars. After 4 years you will be able to copy paste the same sentence just replace 2 doll with 1.1k
@_date: 2017-03-10 17:11:01
Decentralized miners became centralized seeking the prices to grow... what a shame... I just wonder did the Satoshi Nakamoto think about this problem at the begining?
@_date: 2017-03-14 20:15:55
Great, first real evidence
@_date: 2017-03-11 07:50:56
It showed that its impossible to kill bitcoin. What can be worse than Chineese blockings and ETF rejection and it still pushing up! Thumbs up for this currency, future is bright!
@_date: 2017-03-05 10:02:46
I think you will always be able to update electrum to newest version and it will not effect your bitcoins
@_date: 2017-03-06 05:29:07
Thats a good question, i guess they will inform users to move to other wallets
@_date: 2017-03-17 06:53:20
that uncertainty is killing me... hope it will be done in a week
@_date: 2017-03-04 20:54:40
But it that sercive stop working you loose your btc and those keys will be worthless?
@_date: 2017-03-14 16:39:29
I did it without spaces, just wrote here with it. Anyway so trying to downaload all blockchain and then will wait for auto pruning. Jus want to make sure I do not neeed to enable pruning via RPC console? 
@_date: 2017-03-13 19:11:14
All those are for bitcoin only or altcoins too?
@_date: 2017-03-14 09:09:12
I assume Bitcoin core is official bitcoin wallet where you have to download all blockchain, and electrum is lightweight third party, so I wanna now are there any difference where I keep my coins. For example if i keep in electrum, will it support Core team and Segwit, or I will be automatically on the BU side? I am having a hard time to understand it...
@_date: 2017-03-11 09:42:30
And you can store in one ledger for example Btc ethereum dash and ect at one time? Or you need seperafe for everyone?
@_date: 2017-03-27 09:51:02
I agree with all except steem, i still have small amount of trust on them.
@_date: 2017-03-11 07:48:40
It showed that its impossible to kill bitcoin. What can be worse than Chineese blockings and ETF rejection and it still pushing up! Thumbs up for this currency, future is bright!
@_date: 2017-03-10 21:26:14
Me too, in next 3 years BTC will grow a lot
@_date: 2017-03-28 09:45:30
If you have your private keys, secret phrases and pass, try completely remove wallet and install fresh one
@_date: 2017-03-10 21:29:28
Cant agree more! Actually I am happier than ever. We will look who will cry on next FIAT and stock exchange crisis... 
@_date: 2017-03-14 08:15:52
So in my wallet, for example electrum, in this case will appear two coins? For examle if you have 1 BTC you will have 1 BTC and 1 BTU? So if you sell them both you will double your invested money? Or I am missing something?
@_date: 2017-03-27 09:44:14
Yes fuk ETF, it threatens to fubdamentals of BTC
@_date: 2017-03-04 07:21:44
So phone eallet is more like online wallet, all btc is not saved on iphone rather in cloud?
@_date: 2017-03-10 17:03:27
@_date: 2017-03-14 20:15:11
Could not say better lol
@_date: 2017-03-17 10:07:24
thanks for advice
@_date: 2017-03-13 09:45:36
One in my list is Charlie Lee, smart guy, anyone else you follow?
@_date: 2017-03-14 10:23:40
lol I dont have so much space on my mac... so i am stuck on third party wallets...
@_date: 2017-03-14 20:19:17
Missed that one, anyway seems like second failure is much more important and really shows whats going on
@_date: 2017-03-03 08:25:20
yes, there is no such option on mac... I will try to daownload electrum, but how to move that transaction now to appear on electrum when its in progress...?
@_date: 2017-03-16 11:55:41
When and how that HF happens? You can wake up and see that it happen? I mean developers agree lets make HF or it happens somehow automatically in the blockchain? 
@_date: 2017-03-14 07:36:56
Understood, but is there any difference on what wallet to hold? Bitcoin core or electrum?
@_date: 2017-03-14 10:19:00
but it uses lost of space... hell a lot, how much at this moment? 20gb, 30 gb? also what happens to those who have their bitcoins on ledger wallet?
@_date: 2017-03-14 15:50:22
Understood, so at first you need o download all and only then its starta pruning right?
@_date: 2017-03-11 09:10:43
Thanks, its more clear now! Also why some wallets suggest (like multibit) offers other tab for ledger nano owners, so maybe you know what it does? Maybe you can send/receive funds between wallet and ledger?
@_date: 2017-03-19 12:39:11
Thats true, btc needs to choose its right path and when its done, i am the first to buy again
@_date: 2017-03-14 08:01:44
So are there any difference what wallet you use: bitcoin core or electrum?
@_date: 2017-03-14 10:27:39
so its possible to enable it before instaling or first have to download all 120?
@_date: 2017-03-10 21:18:59
Sooner or later it will be approved, so long runners will win, and for short runners now its time to panic lol
@_date: 2017-03-17 13:53:35
Actually One hundred and 28 billion dollars
@_date: 2017-03-02 05:44:52
I m on mac i dont have java and multibit works for me so i think java is not needed.. at least on mac
@_date: 2017-03-03 05:28:40
And why is that, what if you lost you phone?
@_date: 2017-03-17 09:07:27
So what happening? 
@_date: 2017-03-13 12:52:08
@_date: 2017-03-19 12:35:20
When the future is uncertaint I do not want even to buy cheap... I sold my 9 btc right after the sec, firstly i regreted but now i feel hapy about it
@_date: 2017-03-17 06:40:59
Yes used it, really works fast!
@_date: 2017-03-10 17:02:55
kraken, fastest way in europe, takes up to 6 hours with SEPA payment
@_date: 2017-03-10 17:33:38
nothing good then...
@_date: 2017-03-13 11:36:35
Can you be more specific why these are bad guys? I understand ViaBTC is for Bitcoin Unlimited to increase block sizes yes? Why its bad? Still do not understand clearly segwit and BU...
Bad guys trying to destroy bitcoin:    
@_date: 2017-03-14 08:42:33
So in what wallet you suggest to hold bitcoins now: bitcoin core or electrum or its no difference? I am kinda missing the point here
@_date: 2017-03-03 07:42:05
I am not very advanced in this, so I tried to cancel my transaction and try again but my wallet do not let to do it... As I sent all my coins I cant do any other transactions... Can you be more specific what should i do? Thanks
@_date: 2017-03-13 10:25:25
Awesome, thanks!!!!
@_date: 2017-03-11 13:50:47
Thanks for info
@_date: 2017-03-11 10:34:49
nice, so for every currency i need different apps (like BTC electrum and ect), or i could use original app for transfering them all into the ledger yes?
@_date: 2017-03-14 19:30:50
Downloading now all, we will see if it will delete those at the end
@_date: 2017-03-02 05:48:25
I think i need to try electrum, but it seams to be very similar to multibit, any there are any difference you know?
@_date: 2017-03-14 13:13:56
Ant clues when it can happen?
@_date: 2017-03-03 08:22:23
yes to one adress, and i use mac multibit wallet and there is no export keys buttons, I hate this wallet...
@_date: 2017-03-13 12:02:51
I understand that, I am not new in exchange markets and investing, I am just new in crypto market, so just want to hear his opinion. Best practise I know is to hear as much opinions as you can, then decide by yourself.
@_date: 2017-03-14 05:34:22
Sure, i check coindesk and cryptocoinsnews
@_date: 2017-03-14 08:36:49
So how to know each wallet's compatibilities? As I understand Bitcoin core will be for core, and electrum for example will stand for witch side?
@_date: 2017-03-03 05:49:11
How i can change the fee if the tteansaction is already on btc network and waiting for the block?
@_date: 2017-03-03 08:05:18
@_date: 2017-03-11 09:33:46
So after setup device gives you bitcoin address where to send them yes?
@_date: 2017-03-10 21:18:19
Sooner or later it will be approved, so long runners will win, and for short runners now its time to panic lol
@_date: 2017-03-02 07:23:13
What do you think to keep coins in exchange market account is safe? For example poloniex or kraken?
@_date: 2017-03-14 11:21:57
@_date: 2017-03-14 10:52:34
understood thanks. And why is complicated if you want to spend, can explain more about this? I assume you can sell one or another but if the coin dies which you have, you die with her, right?
@_date: 2017-03-14 11:49:20
No i dont, but better know when it might come than put your head into the sand
@_date: 2017-03-03 08:03:13
@_date: 2017-03-17 08:11:00
Thanks for info
@_date: 2017-03-13 19:57:13
Thanks, realy good app!
@_date: 2017-03-17 06:47:30
So when HF is possible to happen? How to know exactly? Or no one know, just sit wait and it might happen after 1 week, month or ect or even do not happen?
@_date: 2017-03-28 09:26:39
I believe in privacy in freedom and bitcoin is a good tool for it
@_date: 2017-08-01 14:11:56
@_date: 2017-08-29 13:40:40
@_date: 2017-08-01 14:30:01
So you mean BItcoin cash altcoin wont appear in near future?
@_date: 2017-08-01 14:12:46
oh very nice, thanks
@_date: 2017-08-29 09:32:14
Is it possible from segwit address to send btc to not segwit adress?
@_date: 2017-08-01 14:40:43
Thats what i thought
@_date: 2017-03-03 08:51:41
Solved it, thanks for everyone who tried to help me here!
@_date: 2017-08-01 14:12:31
I am interested, and want to understand more, more or less its a historical event
@_date: 2017-08-01 14:10:36
Thank you!
@_date: 2017-08-01 14:14:09
cool so now its more clear to me
@_date: 2017-08-01 15:06:09
When it will be safe again to transfer bitcoin to exchanges and make transfers overall, cause now it was announced better to store bitcoins where you can hold your private keys
@_date: 2017-08-01 14:37:04
I think the BCC coin will only appear from chain split of the original bitcoin chain. I think you just try to misslead me lol
@_date: 2017-08-01 14:10:42
thanks! so as i understand the fork will happen when more than 1mg block will be mined but no one knows exactly when? right?
@_date: 2017-11-01 14:11:29
Its not the end, see what happens next fee weeks
@_date: 2017-04-13 11:53:51
Imagine he said, I do not have btc, only litecoin... then the charts makes sense lol buy cheap btc and sell high ltc
@_date: 2017-04-27 17:07:58
still far more than enough... I think this year segwit on BTC is not realistic. I wish it otherwise...
@_date: 2017-04-25 13:22:19
Ands lets assume that you bought some coins from exchange, they were clean not traced by any institution, you moved it around wallets. Is it possible after some time for someone to trace exactly when you bought those coins? For example I might lie that I bought it from local guy 5 years ago, is it possible to trace from that point that I bought not so long ago?
@_date: 2017-04-27 17:16:53
Probably you loose, most likely btc wont solve its problem by then and these days price boom is not long term trend.
@_date: 2017-04-15 14:36:30
And how you fight? By selling your coins? They wait for it to buy cheap. Looks like you dont understand whats going on.
@_date: 2017-04-11 17:50:03
When  is possible to happen? I have heard that at the end of summer, am I right?
@_date: 2017-04-25 11:14:50
So those people who buy locally without id risk that those bitcoins are traced for example by fbi and could get themself in trouble?
@_date: 2017-04-25 11:40:56
So you just can move around wallets your coins for couple of years lol
@_date: 2017-04-14 10:33:42
Leave your vote for segwit then
@_date: 2017-04-25 13:55:25
Ok, thanks for info!
@_date: 2017-04-25 11:43:18
so for example in localbitcoins if you buy bigger amount its better to take id foto of the seller? 
@_date: 2017-04-27 17:14:12
This way is much more likely I think, but when we now know all those backdoors, it might be very very risky thing...
@_date: 2017-04-14 13:50:16
Looks like those who want segwit the most just trying to ignore saying its bulshit and taliking shit about the miners. Yes they suck, but doing like this we do not achieve goals. Yes we always have the option of UASF and might be this scenario is more likely, but to activate segwit with miners siganling it would be much safer and faster and easier, so way to go longer road. 
Anyway, segwit is inevitable thats for sure!
@_date: 2017-04-27 17:25:36
I am being realist, I like BTC, who doesnt, but this time it is still sinking to crisis... hope to see it back on track, but segwit wont happen until the end of this year... the only way for btc is UASF but it still will take time
@_date: 2017-04-07 17:37:28
Ok thanks, so private key is those 24 phrases you write down? 
@_date: 2017-04-27 16:23:59
I heard about it lately, but can you explain what is it? I am not familiar with that paritytech... 
@_date: 2017-04-11 17:53:18
Evil never wins, you dont watch movies? Just sit hodl and wait.
@_date: 2017-04-13 12:26:39
thats true, as long as people will continue to act by listenining to their tweets, they will manipulate for a long. Same now, people sharing what percentage segwit already reached and ect. But its just so far nonsense information when new period haven't started yet. When it starts, look how those miners act, are they blocking or no, if not okey, if blocking then its manipulation again...
@_date: 2017-04-04 05:46:55
Looks good!
@_date: 2017-04-04 07:13:42
@_date: 2017-04-14 09:48:57
Wang Chun promised to listen to the voters! Let's vote!
@_date: 2017-04-07 17:38:05
@_date: 2019-01-10 21:01:01
I dont smoke, so no bitcoin for me lol
@_date: 2017-10-21 12:06:18
True things makes me smile lol awesome
@_date: 2017-10-21 07:41:00
Wait for next month on 18-20th, the major retrace is comming about that time, will be 1 to 2 month of retrace, it couls go down to 3k and lower cause it went up from 1k till now with no montly retrace
@_date: 2017-10-07 16:48:17
lol 
@_date: 2017-10-25 05:22:42
So bcg fork already happened right?
@_date: 2017-10-24 07:53:40
Where can we see when this fork will happen? Exact time or block
@_date: 2017-10-25 05:52:50
Please dont teach me i understand that, but i am trading from time to time bitcoin so to know when forks happen its usefull for the price reverals. I dont care about thta shitcoins, just this info is sensitive to short time prices
@_date: 2017-10-25 05:26:35
So thats make sence that the btc price went on small correction, so 2x predition is on 18 Nov, but how really to track that? What block  to follow? Maybe there is a site where it shows?
@_date: 2017-10-08 05:29:29
Ohh yes value it has, but i mean people who are sending and receiving transactions amount are not so big as you light expect,
@_date: 2017-10-07 16:43:36
At the end it was created to be money, so i am not afraid to use it this way. Of course i  put some aside but i also would love to be able to buy anything for them
@_date: 2017-10-07 17:19:27
HODL is good, I always hodl some percentage of btc but 100% hodl is bad for btc. As you can see now btc has very low volume in transactions, it means that it not serving the main purpose so the adoption level becomes slower too. And one of the reasons that it is becoming only a storage of value. If we want to see bitcoin becoming  global money
@_date: 2017-10-25 05:51:16
So is there the pre determined block for 2x?
@_date: 2017-10-07 16:54:20
I have all other things and its the lats thing i need. I will ask you politely just not to comment any more, you said your opinion and i accept it, thank you and have a nice day
@_date: 2017-10-07 17:09:09
No, but it might be a good thing if they see peoples requests maybe they will consider. It would be great for BTC
@_date: 2017-05-27 09:07:10
Hi there, how its goingon with an adoption lol? Still think it was not a bubble? the big LOL
@_date: 2017-05-27 11:30:23
I dont care if you made money or not, but the thing that you say it was adoption and healthy growth makes you look stupid. Cause it was s buble because some big investment funds from china and japan started buying btc. It woould be still not buble if not those idiots who started buying too thinking that it will go like this to the moon... even bilzerian bouth for more than 10mln doll lol and thats how the bubble was created. Adoption do not make such growth, adoption growth is slower and healthier, as a result we see big retrace as those idiots who where thinking about the moon now selling with loss cause were for short investment and quick profit. Those who bought for long will be in profit for sure. 
Also btc is still in scaling crisis where we cant see the end and such boom is just insanity to call healthy growth. Thats the last message, wont reply you any more cause I see you as an idiot not derserved any conversation.
@_date: 2017-05-20 13:50:31
You mean what coutry? Japan? They made it legal few months ago
@_date: 2017-05-27 10:14:23
Yea right lol now you try to think me that talking about adoption you meant the rise from 400 doll, but we all know you meant rise from 1300 to 2700 and said its so healthy its adoption lol it was bubble and now big retrace. You joker lol taliking shit and predenting to undestand things lol 
@_date: 2017-05-20 08:11:04
I mean I love bitcoin and I am hodler of it but whats happening now doesnt make me happy at all, I dont need profits in one week in such circumstances...
@_date: 2017-05-07 10:08:10
I now that vericoin is just a shitcoin and activated segwit just to get attention... look at me look at me i have segwit... fuk off
@_date: 2017-05-07 09:56:41
Who cares about shitcoin vertcoin when litecoin will have segwit and next one will btc.
@_date: 2017-05-20 15:02:48
60 percent of my portfolio are bitcoins but i plan to sell before sec decision again cause it will be a small dump for sure
@_date: 2017-05-25 20:12:36
Chances are very low
@_date: 2017-07-22 06:31:48
Where can i look for what is signaling what? Any page like it was for litecoin segwit?
@_date: 2017-07-22 06:52:26
Thanks, what actually all users are waiting is UASF right? And miners are planing a HF in November?

And how much we need?

Good question, will it?

I meant by saying cheap about transactions not the price of bitcoin. There is good snd healthy price growth with a reason and not like now. Now its just a store of value and nothing more. In this case bitcoin should be proud of its little brother litecoin, it surely might be like a speed bridge between those two

How it can not beva bubble if currently to use bitcoin is pain in the ass? Soon to send money in fiat will be faster and cheaper... bitcoin isint capable to serve its main purpose: to be fast and cheap transfer coin as a substitute for fiat... but now it sucks so much and despite all these awful things price is still going up... its going up because of a pure speculation and not the adoption or its usability... I smell crisis on the corner... when price are going up and there is no technical reason to go up so sharp, be sure something is wrong

Why are you saying me this? I dont care about bcc, i care when to invest in btc... i mean maybe the bigger swings are comming and its better to wait o invest now, get two coins and sell bcc immidiately after hf, i mean its like free money while bcc will still have at least some value at the begining

 What do you think: its better now before fork and get both coins (and sell bcc for btc) or its better after the fork expecting to buy on the dip more btc?
