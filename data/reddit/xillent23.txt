He was talking down to me because I was not in the financial field. A friend had to step in and align his interests again.

Nice! But why does it look like its in a sketch area? lol

It's a risk i'm sure all Bitcoin holders understand. I'm in it for the long run, not just for the time being.

hahaha, I agree.

LOL honestly that is something I would resort to... But now a days too many people get butt hurt over a punch in the face for their words, police get involved, etc. I tried to keep it professional with my business etiquette. Made my statements and listend to his, so I could see what track his mind was on. I am 6'5 210lbs vs 5'8 170lbs of fat, LOL

LOL thanks for the laugh!

I agree with you. I feel as if he was not prepared enough to talk about the things I mentioned or brought up, due to his lack of research on Bitcoin it's self. I used this opportunity while having a conversation with him to increase my knowledge about finance and general day trading terms. Hopefully he will use it as a learning experience as I did.

I agree with you, I don't believe he is a 'finance guy' either. But he did mention some algorithms and previous history of the stock or whatever they do to make profit.. claiming they have 400% profit. Thanks for your input!

I understand its not in their favor, but why dismiss is? I just found it annoying everytime I asked him if his information was factual he would avoid it. I mean like, he honestly tried to represent the finance, economics and accounting from his only experience with day trading, with what he was *trying* to justify.

I openly admitted to him that because of volatility Bitcoin can fall to zero any day. But like any other fiat currency, it has faith and supporters behind it. He also mentioned that Bitcoin can be 'hacked' and takin' over and has no security... I beg to differ... Exchanges can be a vulnerability, but not so Bitcoin its self from what I've learned/read on this forum, correct me if I'm wrong please.
