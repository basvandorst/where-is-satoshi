newbie, sorry for the stupid question: so these cards are plastic like a credit card but with your receiving address? it says "scan and pay" on the card... how would they extract money from you if all I see if your receiving address?

You probably haven't bought as much as I have to hit the algorithms yet. My first purchase was 20 btc at 1,000K a pop back in November 2013, and I mainly margin trade at Bitfinex which require high balances if you want to ride the 2-5% waves. Its been a mostly loosing investment. You dont have to believe me, but I'm not the first if you use the search function or try bitcointalk.

I bought some today at [coinbase]( Its the easiest with a US account. remember that you can buy fractions of a coin, and you can invest what you FEEL you can TOLERATE losing. It can go up, it can go down. I have faith in this project so I but in a sizeable amount today.
If you don't want to use coinbase, there is also btc-e. or you can buy locally at [Localbitcoins]( localbitcoins is in 192 countries. You are trading with people locally so the end result might be more expensive than at a exchange.
1 coin is roughly $1085 at time of writing.
@_date: 2013-11-29 19:38:30
thing is that a LOT of people are buying it with your idea, wait for it to go up and sell. This is why we are all encouraging others to spend their coins in stores, as opposed to speculating in a pump/dump behavior (that way more merchants will adopt bitcoin, it is a form of currency after all). Anyways, with that in mind, since a LOT of people are buying for this particular reason, it might go really high and then pop! We have already seen about 2-3 bubbles popping with bitcoin before, it has stabilize after it popped, and then grew in value. 
My honest opinion? its going to pop again. I don't know when but def. before 2-3 years. BUT if you believe in bitcoin, are you willing to ride that pop out or will you sell at a loss? I can't find the the thread but there was a guy who got bitcoin right before one of the pops, and loss his AND his sister's inheritance money during a mass panic sell at a loss after the price dropped. If he had rode it out, he would have made lots of money. It really depends on your risk tolerance. 
$500 isn't much, so it wouldn't affect you too much either way. Remember if the value goes up even 10%, you can sell, and that's still profit. You don't have to wait for it to reach its "peak". No one knows when that will be.
I don't know much about  maybe you can make a new thread over it...
@_date: 2013-11-29 20:06:05
My advice: Put in what you feel safe losing. Goes up? yay. Goes down? You were okay with losing that money in the first place.

Do you honestly believe in bitcoin or are you just trying to make a quick buck? Bitcoin is volatile and will experience up and downs. You should only put in what you can be okay with losing. 
$200-$500 will get you a fraction of a coin ($500 is roughly .5 BTC) A lot of people here have faith that it will go up to $2K so theoretically you can double your money. There a lot of good sales today using bitcoin so maybe you're best using it getting good deals that waiting for it to double (I have no magic ball here, it might stabilize at this price, it might go down, the future is unknown)
Mining is over with bitcoin. It will cost you more in electricity than what you will get unless you have a super computer of sorts. 
You can buy some today at [coinbase]( Its the easiest with a US account. remember that you can buy fractions of a coin, and you can invest what you FEEL you can TOLERATE losing. It can go up, it can go down. I have faith in this project so I bought a sizeable amount today (I believe today is around $1088).

I hope you were not scammed.
This is the one thing that troubles me about bitcoin, after you sent your coin to someone, it is essentially giving them cash (i.e. no chargebacks exist). 
Now you sorta have to accept whatever they give you, either the same coins you gave or the coin equivalent of whatever cash you originally spend (which will be significantly less).  Keep calling and calling to get your original coins, best of luck.
@_date: 2013-11-30 01:20:34
I guess its true! (at least to you).

I think its easy to fall for those on your phone or mobile device (ipad etc). Before I click anything, i hover on my laptop and can see the fake url. can't do that on the phone, have to click on link and check url manually, which you can sort of skim over since you're not as careful on the phone than on the computer.

you can buy a fraction of a coin for as low as $1, you don't need donations.
**also see community rules:**
Begging/asking for bitcoins is absolutely not allowed, no matter how badly you need the bitcoins. Only requests for donations to large, recognized charities are allowed, and only if there is good reason to believe that the person accepting bitcoins on behalf of the charity is trustworthy.
@_date: 2013-12-23 21:27:35
There are free ones as long as you keep the number of transactions low, you have to do your research.
But do have 2 accounts:
Personal - where your regular job money goes, etc
Business - where bitcoin goes. and any other internet/commerce business
I have learned from this to always dot my i and cross my t's since what we are doing is nothing wrong, but you have to make the big boys on top not think otherwise.

I think the fact that coinbase eliminated fees is helping with the trade part. For example, I gave a friend today the equivalent of $90 (i owed him for various reasons). If the fees were in placed, most likely I would have paid him via cash since it would have cost more with fees. But since no fees today, and my friend has heard of bitcoin, I mention "cash or bitcoin, its free to send today with bitcoin". And he picked bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-11-29 19:23:57
I owe a debt and paid it back to a friend in bitcoin rather than cash (he prefered bitcoin). I replenished and bought more.

No, its in their terms that they can terminate any account for due cause. They just don't tell you what the due cause is but EVERY BANK has this term if you ever read the terms you sign when you open your account with them.
@_date: 2013-12-23 23:07:50
I have talked to banks and the only solution when a bank decides to break ties is to open a business account somewhere else. The system is broken but once you been flagged, you will continuously be flagged by anti money-laundering algorithm when you use personal accounts. This is the only viable solution right now after flagging. Banks do not have to do business with you, in their terms it says they can terminate your account for any reason and they do not have to tell you why. Even if you try to sue, your lawsuit wont go anywhere. The only possible solution is a class lawsuit but a big firm needs to pick it up.
@_date: 2013-12-16 21:33:08
That's because if they gave you an explicit reason, and it turns out that their reasoning is incorrect and maybe even illegal reasoning for account closure, you can sue them. They are vague on purpose.
@_date: 2013-12-23 21:23:20
No charge backs but you have been flagged by lloyds, due to anti money-laundering algorithms, and they deemed you as a "risky" client, so they decided to cut ties with you.
You can go and fight the bank but the decision is most likely permanent. 
You need to open up a business account elsewhere and soon. Never deal in high amounts cash deposits with personal accounts. Personal accounts is for depositing employer checks, etc. business accounts are for business stuff such as bitcoin. Even if you can prove its just bitcoin, they don't care. 
source: same shit happened to me involving bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-11-27 21:43:12
Chase regularly blocks account for whatever reason. In fact, I have a close friend who received a lifetime ban from them due to "large deposits" made. The letter sent to him alluded to suspicion of money laundering which he didn't do, just mining and bitcoining. I think a lot of us will be accused of money laundering by banks because for them bitcoin is not a good enough reason for random large deposits (i.e. if random people deposit into your bank account lots of money, it must be drug related).

I bought my first bitcoin last week on coinbase. Coinbase says "pending" til wednesday, so on Wednesday I will have my first bitcoin! I bought in at $750 I think and deathly afraid it will go down in a depression-era crash. but I am optimistic. The only thing is that in my attempts to learn about bitcoin I opened up a wallet in MultiBit, and now I don't know how to insert that wallet address into Coinbase (does that make sense?) If anyone is reading this, and know how it is possible, I will appreciate it!
