not hard to cash out. I've used bitstamp. That is a decent exchange which has a bank in a good jurisdiction.
Or if you are US based, using a US exchange is probably a decent idea.

you forget that the non-stop pump since the dip to 5500 on November 2 has very likely been huge hedge fund wales who have been buying with the intention to offload it all via selling futures to other dumb insto funds who haven't legally been able to buy bitcoin until now. And these late entry dumb instos are gonna be left holding the bag. I predict 1-2 weeks after futures launch and then the crash comes.

Yep, however, this does suggest 1 thing - That there likely wasn't any large institutional buying waiting on the sidelines for CBOE futures to open to start buying up bitcoin

i work in finance. Yes, technically they are not buying bitcoin you are correct - it is a cash settled futures contract. Effectively though, they are buying bitcoin due to the fact the prices are closely correlated. If you buy a bitcoin futures contract, likely you are buying from a market maker who will then hedge that position in the cash market (on a bitcoin exchange).

that was the website. the exchange itself would never go down. that tech is solid af

There was a line of thought that suggested institutional investors that haven't been able to get into bitcoin legally due to their compliance obligations would be very keen to buy up the bitcoin futures. Due to the small number of futures traded so far, this seems to not be the case.

buy the rumor. sell the news.

So you think the price goes high because nobody wants to sell there because they can't trust the exchange to withdraw their fiat money?
This is what i was wondering - but it still seems very strange that they would do 1000 volume in Bitcoin each day i.e. $2.5 million USD and people still be unwilling to sell there.
