Thank you. I don't think adding decimal places does anything though. That just means a smaller unit of the same thing. Was curious about how missing BTC play into the future of BTC. I guess it's a newb topic around here that gets asked every day or something.... so I'll go back to /b and see if there are any new tranny pics. Thank you for your response though. I appreciate it.

Thank you.

Thanks much. It's more than 2700 - I mean I lost 130 myself. The weird thing is people lose stuff of value all the time.... so at some point, there's a very large percentage of BTC gone... vanished.... it's a neat thing to think about. Thanks for your reply.

I'm well aware of it. Nearly the entirety of my portfolio were CPU mined coins in 2009 and into 2010 when a dev friend of mine simply wouldn't shut his fucking mouth about bitcoin. It was a curiosity, but the budding neckbeard in me found a great deal of satisfaction in both the promise and neato factor. I really never cared about market value. In the last few years, I've done my share of lazy-man's buys through coinbase, and I follow the news generally, but am more interested in value these days - but I'm not living or dying by it. BTC has been extremely good to me. What I've watched develop over the last couple years is simply sad. Whenever there's a value perception, there will be those looking for power, influence, and profit - no coin will be immune from that - as it is human nature.
Today, I view the bitcoin community at large (not this sub) as a massive disappointment that is looking to self-murder itself by losing sight of the "movement's" core values. That core value misalignment is far less present in LTC - therefore, I am more comfortable continuing to support the coin with a balance between purity of intent, and potential value. LTC clearly pushes this button for me, it may not for you. 
It's not a religious argument for me, and this is not a team sport. Watching this all is simply disgraceful.

I don't think you're paying attention, or don't understand what the word drama means. I have no short term or long term concerns regarding LTC - nor do have unrealistic expectations.

No, but you make a good "Hi, I'm Mongo and haven't evolved to the point of intellectual curiosity" type argument. I very clearly pointed out that that the drama is driven by human nature and impossible to completely avoid. i also pointed out that the BTC drama has the potential to be far more destructive. You can do what you like, though.
Arguing with people who enjoy arguing for the sake of it isn't really my thing. You'll have to do better than this. Had I realized you were "one of them" I'd have avoided engaging with you. Have a good day.

huh. I guess I'll have to dig into this too - because I thought since the premise of BTC is that it's largely decentralized, and predominantly anonymous, that there'd be no mechanism for monetary policy related to making 'majority' decisions.
@_date: 2017-07-15 14:13:34
You misunderstand me. I know that the SegWit8x proposal is about power. What I'm trying to say is that the reasons don't matter once the mess is made. Today, BTC is its own worst enemy. If it can't stand as the decentralized construct that drove the value to begin with, it will have no value. There is no opportunity for one side to be right, or one side to win. BTC is now a politicized mess, and completely out of step with intent, if there is no common way forward, there is no way forward. I am in favor of resisting - but resisting isn't winning. So, yes, I am converting my remaining 1131 BTC to LTC over the next week.

This attitude right here is the problem. is right. The folks that have the time to take to "educate themselves" aren't high enough in numbers to matter, in the big picture.
This whole fuckmess comes off like a bunch of neckbeards screaming at each other. If nothing else, it'll just illustrate perfectly why mom's basement is the safest place for them. It's sad when smart people show a lack of intellectual curiosity.
That said, I agree that the decision with the most integrity is to simply resist - but appreciating the reality of what that means is also very important - because in the end, "working and reliable" was really, really important.
A mass exodus to LTC is more appealing to me, personally. In this case, I like the idea of simply abandoning ship and leaving a carcass.
