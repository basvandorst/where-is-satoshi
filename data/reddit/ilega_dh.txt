You have to verify your identity first IIRC

I'll tell you something Mr. Banky McBankface: good luck with that.

Probably the safest thing to do, although if you say that out loud this sub would crucify you lol

They aren't the too-big-to-fail banks. Talking about JPMorgan, Goldman, etc. here.

I love how Roger Ver had that public letter a while ago and signed it as "Roger Ver, CEO of Bitcoin Cash"...
What the hell kind of decentralised currency has a CEO??

All of them AFAIK. But it only shows up after a search with no results and not on the homepage.
edit: jk, I tried a few of them and assumed it was on the original. Can't check the original because censorship, yay.
@_date: 2017-12-25 16:49:39
Note: this showed up after a failed search on several mirrors of the site. I can't check the original, so I'm not sure if these are the proxy's addresses or the real TPB ones.
Edit: someone confirmed this is in fact on the original site!

But that's not what I'm saying. I'm saying people in general are quite stupid/don't care and there are a few very rich and powerful people profiting off of that.
BTC might just shift this power to other people, but it's a start.
@_date: 2017-12-09 14:44:07
If someone invents a computer that can crack Bitcoin, I don't think it will be worth that much anymore :(
I've put my server on it, trying passwords as we speak. I'll keep you updated.

I see the trolls are out of energy and have now started using movie quotes.
@_date: 2017-12-04 13:34:27
Except now they can cheat. They print more money whenever the flying fuck they want, making our money worth less in the process.
We're just levelling the playing field.

I would love to use Gemini! Unfortunately they aren't available in mainland Europe :(
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:34:46
You can use Bittrex! (
@_date: 2017-12-25 17:19:14
Thanks for confirming!

Banks are shady and powerful. I'm don't want to speculate about any conspiracy theories but if I were them, I'd be attacking on multiple fronts.

I don't think you realise how incredibly huge the number 2^160 is. That is WAY more than the amount of stars in the universe. 
Yes, of course there is a chance. But there is also a chance the entire Earth would be quantum tunnelled to the other side of the universe at any time. Which is larger than you guessing a used private key.
@_date: 2017-12-29 01:04:25
Hey now, we all know transactions take longer than 3 seconds okay
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:12:43
No, Bcash wanted to solve the scaling problem by increasing block size which is short-sighted and ineffective. Bitcoin wants to solve it by SegWit + Lightning, which takes a bit longer to test and implement but should work for the foreseeable future. It's a marathon, not a sprint.

If you hodl BTC, you will have enough money to buy popcorn :’)

Me too, but it still has 3x the sells. I wonder if that wipes out the entire buy order book?

Good job my ni��️��️a

It's defamation. It's simple to say "omg look we have to outlaw it only criminals use it!!1!".
The only thing you can't do is snort cocaine through it, which is actually possible with USD. Let's outlaw all paper currency!

Impossible. Apple would never allow such an app in their app store.
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:36:11
Welcome to Bitcoin baby!
@_date: 2018-05-31 16:57:02
Doing it through a website is way easier than through an app, especially on iOS. This isn't even remotely the same.

What the heck? They aren't embracing it, they have to pay it because of ransomware. 
Either you're Dutch and suck really bad at English, or not Dutch at all and Google Translated this article.

Yeah we need to know, for investigatory purposes.

While your message is good, it would benefit both you and the message to not be a condescending fuck. He's here for the first time maybe, how the hell would he know that Coinbase is shit?

Hey I started a node a few months ago and haven't seen any free beer. How does that work???
@_date: 2017-08-23 05:06:18
The people that change the world are the ones that don't listen to all the voices saying "You can't do that!" or "That will never work!".
People should think in solutions, not problems.

Wow edgy. What's the point of this post exactly?
@_date: 2017-08-17 04:43:26
Holy shit, if that's still on there you're going to be a millionaire. Keep us posted!
@_date: 2018-06-14 14:06:59
It is decentralised. You can't transfer money without your bank, but you can always open a channel to your friend and nobody can stop you.
@_date: 2018-06-15 07:17:22
That's a buyer being scammed, not a seller. 
Also, you're missing the entire point of bitcoin. It's not made to be consumer friendly, it's made to not be under anyone's control. 
@_date: 2018-06-14 10:32:13


And this is where I stopped to take your "question" seriously. 
It's not even done yet, let alone released. 
Stop spreading fud by asking fake questions, this is pathetic.

Which is exactly the entire point of bitcoin, no one controls your money but you. 
@_date: 2018-06-14 15:22:00
A seller can't be scammed as long as they only send the product after receiving funds. There is no charge back on LN, all transactions are final. 
@_date: 2018-02-18 19:29:24
It's not like a game which has a release date (and then usually doesn't work but that's another story). It's an ongoing process and while it's possible to run on mainnet, it's very risky and needs more testing. After that, we need user-friendly interfaces for the general public to be able to use it. That's when adoption happens.
@_date: 2015-09-19 22:19:09
That's cute. 
@_date: 2015-11-03 14:57:03
I'd like to know too, looks like we missed something.

Almost every single VPN provider accepts bitcoin directly, I use CrypticVPN and they accept it.
