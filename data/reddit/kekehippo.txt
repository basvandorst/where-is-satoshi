You're looking for sympathy after getting paid less than what you thought you deserved?  Huh, funny that.

It's taxed with the valuation of the sale of property.  How's that "pretty badly" it's not taxed like marijuana sales, which is roughly 60% is the cost.

If Overstock sees success by increasing their margin, best believe Visa and Amex to get up in arms and try to sink BTC as a method of transacting.

Why not just open an account with them and use after tax proceeds to purchase bitcoin with them?  Singapore is a tax shelter. 
@_date: 2014-03-06 17:02:59
Not exactly what I was expecting, but exactly what should have been expected from someone who created bitcoin and as reclusive as he was.

@_date: 2014-01-08 23:12:31
Yes, Stateside.  But and of course I'm speaking in hypotheticals;if you were to pass along money after tax monies to an intermediary in Singapore where they purchase BTC there for you and hold them under your name, I can't see American taxes applying to that.  I of course have limited exposure to the international tax consequences of foreign investments being an American citizen.

You spent more time writing a post blasting Coinbase and complaining to us about it than fixing your own damn problem.  You sir smell like a shill.

Reddit is entirely more popular than you think it is.

Only a guess really.  If he has a particular fear of numbers he may not want to trade BTC.... Just saying. 
@_date: 2013-06-05 08:08:27
It'll be a losing game for you, you think they would just go after bitcoin?  It would be all cryptocurrencies. 
@_date: 2013-12-06 20:21:48
When folks attach a currency value vs other currency its going to be for investing/trading purposes.

Baidu STOPPED TAKING BITCOIN.  There's nothing misinformation about that.
@_date: 2013-12-03 22:43:14
No two analysts on the street can agree on lunch let alone what a price of something should be.  The price of BTC will be decided on the demand, and that demand can rise as high as anything and drop to almost nothing, and it's nothing that BTC folks haven't seen before. 
@_date: 2013-04-13 15:20:18
Doesn't Amazon accept Bitcoins?
@_date: 2013-11-24 20:33:52
We can go around circles all we want but if you look at it back then it was conversion into USD.  Point is that it went down in value, and if you see a bubble or potential short term down turn then prepare for it. 
@_date: 2013-12-03 22:51:57
That's strange because I only get those calls because they are suspecting someone of hacking your account. 
@_date: 2013-05-04 19:04:43
He's money, if dead cats and hobo teeth were a currency somewhere he'd know about it.  Least he's heard about it, this is true, hopefully BTC gets popular enough to warrant his attention, and hopefully...hopefully he doesn't buy all of it.

I should have bought when Mt.Gox had the price at $54...ho hum...ho hum...
@_date: 2013-11-25 20:37:26
I did some research, what's the deal with Mining Contracts? 
@_date: 2013-12-06 20:17:21
Because companies love offering stuff for bitcoin where they can't convert to actual currency that they need to use to operate their business with. 
@_date: 2013-06-20 18:43:22
Oh...well thanks for that then!
@_date: 2013-12-03 13:28:40
You can continue to link a million articles that I'm sure you haven't read nor analyzed yourself.  Bitcoin is not replacing the dollar, the yuan or the peso anytime in the distant future.  I'm having trouble wrapping my head around what exactly it is that you are trying to prove or accomplish.  Linking to an article does not explain your point. 
@_date: 2013-06-14 21:44:56
Are you serious?
@_date: 2013-12-03 20:58:46
Let's stop with the insults right now, exactly what am I suppose to put together?  That's fine that they are distancing themselves from the Dollar it's actually GREAT.  The US has wanted that for the last two years.  China kept the value of the Yuan vs USD low so they could keep manufacturing costs low, therefore propping up their export heavy economy, which the US is one of their biggest importer of Chinese goods.  Now that they are moving away the costs of making things will go up putting companies in positions to relocate their factories.  We aren't talking garments and textiles, we are talking heavy duty manufacturing, technology, computers, cell phones, etc, and there are only certain nations in the world where factories like those can exists and exist for the right price.
Beyond what you may feel this is GREAT for the US, and other countries who want to see tech factories in their countries.  China is looking to strengthen the buying power of their currency, the draw back is that the cost of labor will go up, but their people will be able to buy more with the monies from other countries so their imports will go up.  It's a mutual circle, but to believe that BTC is somehow going end up a reserve currency any time soon is really shoddy logic.
@_date: 2013-12-17 13:44:49
It's time to stop with the circle jerks and posting stupid memes.  I thought I could come here for stimulating discussion about bitcoin and now the market is doing, and what it is doing.  It's come to the point of just unsubscribing and just lurking over at @_date: 2013-06-05 20:48:03
Everyone, who feasibly invests in anything should think of an end game or more commonly known as a exit strategy.  Goldilocks is only gold for so long.
@_date: 2013-06-05 00:55:23
The people you are referring to also make policy, countries will adopt or not adopt bitcoin as a currency-option if it "disrupts" the value of the US Dollar.  I'm not doomsaying, but its not far fetched for the US Gov't to seek to hinder, halt, or completely destroy Bitcoin if it poses a threat to its interest.  For everyone who says it would be impossible, may be just underestimating how powerful of an influence the US is on the world stage.
Having Bitcoin base its value vs the US Dollar is a great strategic idea for currency, as everyone else in the world uses it.  But to move away from it, to say in an immediate future it could be the world's reserve currency is a bit foolish and dangerous talk.
@_date: 2013-05-05 01:06:09
Well if you have some figures you'd like to share, go ahead.
@_date: 2013-11-24 21:10:48
February of 2012 it went beyond 400 and dropped. 
Edit:  Almost two years ago
@_date: 2013-12-07 14:11:14
Yeah because one of few redeeming qualities is talking about how to make money and being very specific about it.  Social BS on the other hand is not my strong suit. 
@_date: 2013-04-20 02:52:11
I would love to see this happen but correct me if I am wrong, but only 22 million bitcoins are in circulation?  That would mean bitcoins picked up additional currencies along the way, or someone decided to make more, how does that work?
@_date: 2013-12-06 18:14:05
Instead of bitcoin being marketed as currency, why wasn't it just marketed as a commodity?  A commodity that goes up and down in value that affords the respective owner(s) secure, anonymous, and speedy transactions?  Oh well. 
@_date: 2013-11-25 19:37:56
Do not do this, the US government is many things, but when it comes to tax evasion and fraud they are not stupid.
@_date: 2013-12-10 18:21:26
Why have a decentralized commodity only to revert it to a centralized location? 
@_date: 2013-11-24 19:51:09
It matters if you see a bubble you prepare for it.  The last bubble saw prices drop down to $118 from $400.  Hedge and reinvest. 
@_date: 2013-11-24 20:51:43
I saw significant drops from $400 down to the lower hundreds.  This wasn't a year ago, more like two+.  I still think if anyone feels strongly about a downturn, they should prepare for it. 
@_date: 2013-04-30 22:23:56
I've always seen hackers as these rebellious kids in a basement trying to get at the man!  Until PSN was hacked, when DDoS became a household name, when I had to stress to my family not to put everything [of] value in the Cloud because EverNote got hacked.

It's also being restricted by their central banks.   
@_date: 2013-12-03 13:22:34
What facts?  Where in that article does it say bitcoin is going to be replacinh the dollar or the yuan? 
@_date: 2013-06-26 18:43:17
That would mean educating their employees as to what bitcoin is and as to why they aren't getting actual monetary bonuses that they can use to buy stuff at the local big box store.

Termites eating paper currency is akin to being scammed out of your bitcoins I see.

Please, someone tell me how this is going to be good news for Bitcoin.  We all know BTC holds value, we all know it serves a purpose.  How long do we keep deluding ourselves that it's more suitable as a commodity than currency?
@_date: 2013-12-17 05:12:43

You're talking about the same government that caused the cultural revolution.  I think your vastly underestimating the capability of China's government to not give any ducks.

Not likely to happen in two decades I would dare to speculate.  It would take a tremendous effort of both social and business sectors to fully embrace Bitcoin.  If Bitcoin is "replace" a currency, it needs to be accessible to all peoples, and not just folks who are computer and technical savvy.

You can go assume all you want, there's no misinformation by saying Baidu won't allow bitcoin purchases because they will not be able to convert it over to their currency fast enough to fill demand and pay bills on their end.
I have my shares of BTC, I've sold them and made a profit and I'll buy more when BTC bottoms out at 400 or 500, or maybe even as low as 200 per USD.  I'll allow you to prop up yourself with whatever belief you have in BitCoin but you're only deluding yourself if you think the larger corporations and businesses will accept BTC with little chance to get their money quickly.

Everything you've talked about, the media, my friends, my family don't relate, nor call them "hackers".  I think you're losing me on what is perceived as a hacker vs. someone who is beneficial / influential in programming, program design, and coding.
I don't see Bill Gates as a hacker, nor do I see Steve Jobs as one.  I know they both coded or something of that nature but the image isn't there.  I see those folks are visionaries, there's a distinct difference here.
