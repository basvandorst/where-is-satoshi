Normal variance. This actually isn't even the worst luck round Eligius (or most other pools, actually) has had. It just seems that way because Eligius's % of the network is relatively low these days.
Big improvements coming to Eligius soon! :)

After nearly 3 years I still find it interesting that people think Luke still runs Eligius... 
Anyway, I added a filter to Eligius's bitcoind that appears to successful filter today's spam attack/stress test/DoS/whatever you want to call it from being included in Eligius's blocks.
There was much rejoicing today on IRC when Eligius mined a ~900KB block that contained nearly 2800 transactions, about 70% by size (about 85% by count) of the ~1300KB worth of non-spam transactions being broadcast and most people's legit transactions that were delayed by the spam attack were confirmed. (take 2, reddit)

This is one of the dumbest things I've ever heard.

As of this writing, AFAIK Eligius is the only pool that mined full size blocks.

Still pretty suspect. lol.

First, I find it amusing that people are throwing money at this address just because someone claims the funds go to Snowden. lol.  I'm surprised with all of the scams out there this one slips by... someone is counting their money right now, and it sure isn't Snowden.
Anyway, no idea on if this is legal or not either, but as the operator of Eligius I will inform you that I have no issue responding to legal requests for information about connections to the pool regarding specific addresses, as stated in the FAQ.
As a request, I would ask kindly that Eligius not be used for this purpose.  I prefer to avoid potential legal nonsense when possible.

You'll note there have been zero coinbase notes, no mining of scamcoins, etc while I've been managing Eligius.

Also, I assume you, like many others who are just against Eligius, assume that making sure everyone knows about this little patch would mean people would stop mining at Eligius.  On the contrary, the majority of the people I've spoken to on IRC approve of the change.  Several high hash rate miners have specifically switched to Eligius from other pools to support the patch.  So, IMO, I'm probably gaining less by slacking on my news updates than I would if I made a big deal out of it.

Makes little sense to bash Eligius.  I'll point out for the sake of completeness that Eligius has been under new management since any of the allegedly negative actions have taken place.

It doesn't really affect miners. They're still paid the same. 0% fee CPPSRB for bitcoin and 105% NMC PPS for namecoin.
No need to go out of my way with a notification campaign for it, since most of the latest information really is just posted to the bitcointalk thread.

I'm grateful Luke keeps an eye on the thread and helps folks out.  The address reuse patch was applied after much discussion about it. (inner monologue: why am I on reddit?)
@_date: 2013-11-24 01:15:56
It doesn't.  This is just anti-Eligius FUD. :-\
