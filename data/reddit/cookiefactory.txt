It's an ABC corrective sequence. Read a book.

I look forward to seeing if this plays out as it's certainly a plausible scenario. That said, the two circled areas are not all that similar - the first contains a lower low while the second circle has a higher low. Personally I think we're in Wave 4.

Yeah, we will just agree to disagree on counts then.

Get educated, peasant.

Y’all people dumb as fuck. I’m no Coinbase fanboy but what were they supposed to do? The alternative was they refuse to support BCH and silently swallow all your coins (can you imagine the uproar then?). They gave customers their BCH and then provided a market to trade them (again imagine the criticism and logistics of providing the former but not the latter). Could they have executed a bit better? Sure, but let’s not mistake (relative) incompetence for malice.

Someone’s taken an econ 101 course and thinks he’s big man on campus.

That’s a gross simplification and not accurate model of how the world works. Reserve currency status is neither a get out of jail free card nor an invariant of the world order.

Because instead of a tight-rope walk on inflation, you have guaranteed hyper-inflation. 
If all that extra money is “spent into the economy” you now have a huge influx of money chasing after the same amount of goods - the very definition of inflation. 
The thinking is giving the money capitalists *who don’t need to spend it all on necessities * will lead to capital investments, R&amp;D, etc which will lead to long term economic growth.

“My guess is they’ll have more to show for it in the next 6 months then ETH has produced in 3 years”
Textbook example of self-sabotage via hyperbole.

That’s storing it. Not keeping it.
@_date: 2018-07-07 02:25:10
But many do. In fact that’s one of the primary use cases.

I’d encourage you to become educated on the subject. You should start with learning about fractional reserve banking.

Yes it does. Your analogy was in rebuttal of a primary use-case of Bitcoin using items which are not stores of value.
@_date: 2018-07-07 01:18:06
False analogy. You didn’t buy those tools to use as a store of value.

I think you're confused or replied to the wrong person.
@_date: 2018-07-07 13:44:25
That’s not the argument. The argument is against your statement that banks do not conjure money out of thin air, which they do. That it’s possible via Bitcoin as well is red herring, intentinal or otherwise.

Given the choice would said hammer manufacturer prefer a warehouse full of hammers or their equivalent (saleable) value in dollars?
