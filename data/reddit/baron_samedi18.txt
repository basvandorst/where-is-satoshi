"Futures contracts give traders a way to bet on bitcoin prices and earn profits without buying the actual cryptocurrency."
I guess we won't be seeing a change in the average price of Bitcoins or other alt currencies?

So I read that the company dealing in futures will procure or sell off coins at the end of every trading day. If it works like that,  then I have my answer.

I'm noticing that the media is becoming more positive about bitcoin and blockchain technology. Whereas a while back you only heard about them when devaluating, mixed up in scandals or used as ransom currencies. 
If more people start thinking for themselves it's only a logical alternative. Don't you agree Spock? ;)

Agree.. forced move to crypto is not necessarily a good thing.

War on cash has been ongoing for a while . Because there is still cash/ paper money they can't put a negative interest rate on your savings account, or there would be a bankrun.  There is even talk about devaluating cash in comparison with your plastics and digital funds( The 1s and 0s in the banksysteem...Don 't know the English word) money. Because paper money or cash would dissapear doesn't mean crypto will take over. I hope that crypto will co-exist in the naar future, not replace.  If it would replace the current system entirely. I think we have heavier things to worry about than money.

Check the videos of Andreas Antonopoulos. Only invest what you can afford to lose. How to hide you hoard.

Already lost my interest in this article after this sentence: "The company hopes to have its own distributed ledger network go live in the second half of 2018."
Isn't this just like a company digitizing all their paperwork by having interns scanning all their paper documentation? 
Maybe the article gets more interesting later on, but all these hopeful headers turn out to be totally bogus and in the end have very little to do with the whole bitcoin/ blockchain philosophy.
