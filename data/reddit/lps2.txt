@_date: 2017-12-26 05:28:18
Those DMCA C&amp;D are because you are connecting to servers owned by the IP owners which is why a blocklist helps - your ISP is simply passing it on from the IP owner. Thats beside the point anyway as the argument was that the traffic amounts we're large enough to trigger interest from your ISP which isn't true. Many people, including myself, push through a lot more data without any notice or complaint from my ISP because as I stated earlier, the amount is still within the cap limits

Correct me if I'm wrong but with LN you can only send to others that are in some way connected to you, either because they are in a channel with you or there is a path between the two so at some point both you and whoever you want to send to has to have some BTC tied up in a LN, no?

@_date: 2015-06-04 21:16:28


Yes, [were]( as in past-tense. Areas were horribly underserved and ultimately roads had to shut down. Agreements for road use so often touted by an-cap / libertarian type amount to a bureaucratic nightmare that would make the IRS look efficient.  


[Just over 90% of Americans drive to work]( and [approximately 70% of freight is delivered via trucks]( Much like other socialized services, spreading the costs out ensures that otherwise underserved areas are still able to benefit from roadways. The alternative would impose heafty fees on individuals living away from dense population centers (much like internet service availability). Socialized roadways are absolutely needed for commerce as well as individuals, the alternative of privatized roadways simply falls apart.

@_date: 2018-08-03 00:02:06
I'll chime in - I haven't seen any evidence that X number of current nodes would fall off the network with a given blocksize increase. All the fears of decentralization being compromised are wholly theoretical. Is there a level of increase where decentralization would take a hit? Absolutely but I can't find anyone who has actually attempted to find that level and it sure as fuck isn't 2MB which is what caused the whole split in the first place

I don't see regulation as inherently a bad thing. It seems that the largest cost of being an exchange is getting bonded in every state. While this is a high barrier to entry, when handling tons of money its absolutely necessary. Instead of relaxing regulation, our legal and regulatory bodies need to clarify their stance on bitcoin so businesses aren't so hesitant to deal with them.

The costs of becoming an MSB don't seem very high. The costs come in from having to be bonded in every state and personally I think this is a good thing.

Also, for under a couple million you could get setup in a couple states like CA and/or NY and cover a huge swath of the US bitcoin community.

So your entire argument here is that there shouldn't be regulation that forces MSB's to be bonded because the insurance company is just going to dick over the customer anyway? You're pulling on extreme examples (like Katrina with home insurers) and trying to pretend like that is the norm. I'm not sure about your experience, but insurance companies pay out all the time and policies are written specific to a given field's standards.  


Again, what are you talking about. You seem to be referring to banks and how they are insured BY THE GOVERNMENT (in the US the equivalent would be FDIC and it covers up to $250k) - that is not analogous as no one is requesting the government back bitcoin deposits in banks. In the US, if you are a Money Services Business according to FinCEN, you have to be bonded in each state you operate in. This is PRIVATE insurance who's participation is regulated (eg. if you are an MSB, you have to have it). This insurance is not mandated to cover all deposits into the exchange but there is a minimum (varies by state [here]( is a decent rundown of how it works specific to bitcoin exchanges).  




The insurance company who issued the bond to the exchange.  
Regulation allows standards to be set for exchanges (and I personally think there should be a lot more regulation concerning HOW bitcoin exchanges operate) which then allows bond issuers to have clearer policies which makes the entire process of determining if an event qualifies for the bond payout or not much easier and less ambiguous.

What are you even talking about? Currently the only option investors have who lost their money on Gox have is the suit against Gox. This will take quite some time and even then there is a good chance they will never see their money (if it is true that Gox no longer has those funds - they can't pay out what they don't have and liquidation won't yield much). Regulation (like what FinCEN has put forward for MSB's) requires money services to be bonded in each state.  
Had MtGox been in the United States and fallen under FinCEN regulation (like coinbase and others) then consumers have more options to get their money back. The company is bonded and insured such that the company bonding them must pay out to customers when a situation like this arises.  


Yet again, not sure where you are getting this - the insurance company would pay out up to the maximum of the policy - regulation does not currently require all funds being held and as such MSB's are bonded up to a certain amount - that amount is what I expect to be paid out. They can pay more and be bonded for more but as far as regulation goes there is a baseline that is required (so a situation like MtGox cannot happen where customers lose their funds and will likely never see them again).  


Please go take an econ course for fucks sake - you sound like a chain email my grandmother would have. I don't think even you have any idea what you are talking about.

Except, you know, this post and like half of the others. I've just stopped using Reddit for cryptocurrency news as the communities just suck. Here if you so much as mention how delayed LN is or raising the block size you get called a paid shill for Roger and on BTC if you so much as mention the benefits of something like LN you get called a paid shill for blockstream - technical and philosophical discussion is snuffed out quick in both places

Having some legal recourse is better than no recourse if you fuck up securing your btc, lose your keys, etc...
@_date: 2019-10-04 15:57:23
You must not be a car person because the Tesla handles like a boat. 0-60 is great but unless you're drag racing, who fucking cares. Similarly, there's virtually no driver input - no manual gearbox (No gears on the Tesla and I have the same issue with newer supercars with dual clutches), steering that is horribly indirect, computers out the ass for every type of assist you can think of. Don't get me wrong, Teslas are absolutely fantastic luxury cars but a driver's car they absolutely are not.
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:54:10
Can we not resort to this petty shit. Different coins have different use cases and if/when one of those use cases garners the same kind of market attention it will raise BTC as well
@_date: 2017-11-09 16:11:56
And keeping your keys in your own wallet is like stuffing your life savings in an unbreakable vault - if you lose your key, you're fucked and have absolutely no recourse
@_date: 2017-11-09 15:34:47
Why is there such a big push in this sub to fully controlled your bitcoin? It seems like a good way to have beginners lose a ton of money because they set up a wallet incorrectly / lose their private key / etc... Being one's own bank is a feature of Bitcoin, not a requirement
@_date: 2017-11-15 16:53:44
With higher fees than BCH, yes (also currently lower than BTC). Why do people in this sub pretend as if the runaway fees and tx congestion isn't a problem just because they don't like BCH or the people behind it? You can both disagree with BCH and still recognize that bitcoin has lost one of its largest use cases because fees are fucking retarded right now
@_date: 2017-11-08 21:54:17
Yeah, fuck me for wanting lower fees, right? 
@_date: 2019-12-31 02:01:32
Regulatory concerns seem pretty damn important IMO. Hell I'd rather have ATM posts than shit slinging at BCH or other cryptocurrencies. It's like the whole use case discussion has stopped and it's all personal attacks and circlejerking now
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:56:34
Well, if you don't you're just stupid and have thrown money into something just to collect. Spending Bitcoin *is* selling, it doesn't have to be for another currency
@_date: 2017-04-30 23:49:28
No, it's not - segwit is a permanent solution to malleability, not scalability. We still need something like LN or the easiest solution of all, increasing the fucking block size
@_date: 2019-04-25 22:33:39
Who said anything about long-term? How is a 2MB limit harmful? I've asked time and time again how many nodes would be unable to handle a 2MB limit and no one ever has answers. You can't claim it kills decentralization without any facts to back up that assertion. Also, calling people idiots or shills (seriously, if you think any coin is dropping money on massive amounts of online accounts, you're horribly misguided) isn't exactly conducive to conversation. It's such a shame that Segwit2X failed after the NYA and the community split into these rabid factions treating crypto like sports teams instead of taking a step back, looking at use cases the community wants implemented, and figuring out the best way to solve for them
@_date: 2017-11-16 20:27:59
Yup, that's my goal. I've got the Elise, now I just need a Macan so I don't have to rent a car to go snowboarding

Jesus it's like you're trying to prove their point. I've been in Bitcoin since 2011 and my god the community has gotten terrible
@_date: 2019-04-25 22:23:21
I'm sure the mempool won't be an issue for thousands of microtransactions /s Bitcoin has the same scaling issues it had 1.5yrs ago and it's getting really frustrating watching the community circle jerk over LN that's perpetually behind schedule rather than just increasing the damn block size.
@_date: 2019-04-26 01:40:58
That's exactly what it is. Instead of actually debating the merits of keeping the blocksize at ~1mb / not increasing to 2MB soon you are saying "the majority doesn't want a blocksize increase now" - that's not participating in the conversation, that's shutting it down without defending your position.
@_date: 2019-04-25 23:51:57
Again, that's the theory but how many nodes are *actually* affected? I would wager that most node operators are doing so on VPSs with large datacaps already and would be unaffected by an increase but until the community moves on from pointless posturing and dick measuring between coins, we will never tackle the real problems. LN development is great and I 100% think it's where significant development should take place but even LN devs and advocates say we will need to increase the blocksize so why not do it sooner rather than later so we don't have a large mempool and $1+ tx fees cutting off a massive segment of the world's population. I didn't get into bitcoin for a digital knick-knack that I hope keeps or goes up in value, I got into it for the  practical uses and high tx fees and stuck txs ain't practical.
@_date: 2019-04-26 00:06:24
That's a bit of a cop out, no? Of course "the time is when we reach consensus" that's the mechanism by which it occurs - the entire point of us taking part in conversation here in the forums is to hash out the pros/cons of changes to Bitcoin. I would like to hear arguments on why we should not increase it and the one argument I've heard I already outlined above - how many nodes would actually be affected by a block size increase and is that enough to outweigh the downsides of cutting out huge swaths of the world from using the network and stifling innovation on chain re: microtransactions.
@_date: 2019-04-25 22:30:43
How does LN solve this issue? How/who is going to open the channels? Honest question as my very limited knowledge of LN tells me it is t the right fit for this use case but I would love to be wrong

Uhh, did *you* read the article? The guy filing suit is claiming there was insider trading with no evidence and is mad because he claims his order executed at a higher value than when he made it. This is something that will be easy to prove/disprove
@_date: 2018-03-03 16:28:24
Bitcoin isn't a security nor is it a company with which someone could have insider info for - if Coinbase was public and they traded Coinbase stock then you would be right but thats not the case. So, again, what law did they supposedly break and how does that entitled the guy filing suit to any money. Please read the rest of the article - this is a frivolous suit and the guy in question doesn't seem to understand how Coinbase/GDAX works
@_date: 2018-03-03 04:34:12
I've been in bitcoin for quite some time now. When I first bought it was the tradehill days when you deposited into a random BoA account and a while later you got some bitcoin. I jumped on board with Coinbase as soon as they went live and the only issue I have had with them was verifying my credit card and they use a third party IIRC. The vast majority of complaints I see from people on here in regard to Coinbase are people who were all trying to join and get verified during the ridiculous surge in interest at the end of last year or people sending wires. Coinbase should have notified people earlier about pulling their BTC if they wanted to keep BCH during the first fork but it was something they still gave, what, 2 week notice over and had been a topic in bitcoin communities for months - so again, what specifically was unprofessional and do you have any recommendations going forward. Jesus this sub has gone to trash when you can't even discuss anything
@_date: 2019-01-30 00:25:49
He's not bashing Bitcoin but rather claiming that Kraken has cash liquidity issues and doesn't have the cash on hand for this person to take out his money. It's a stupid argument for this small of an amount but that's the argument they're making

(as another software engineer) I didn't comment on any technical aspects of the rollout so I'm not sure how you being an SE is relevant. Again I'll ask, what should they have done differently and what laws are you claiming cover how their rollout of a new feature / product must be handled?
@_date: 2018-03-03 04:00:14
How was it unprofessional? They launched it which caused the price to go up and then newcomers saw the price soar and also jumped in and this snowballed to the point of coinbase being unable to handle the load - what was unprofessional on their part?
@_date: 2018-02-08 22:24:35

Attack now means a difference in opinion, apparently
@_date: 2017-10-26 17:53:24
No they won't, they'll just rebrand it as 'blockchain' like they are already doing. Banks don't hate Bitcoin - they don't see it as a threat - they see it as a tool they can leverage to their advantage and are investing a ton of money into doing exactly that
@_date: 2017-10-26 17:55:45
Shhh, get your facts out of here and whip your dick out for the circle jerk
@_date: 2017-10-26 17:48:59
But then you don't get the security that decentralization gives. I think banks will eventually end up piggybacking on an existing chain to leverage it's security. It will be cheaper to use an existing chain than invest/develop their own...

I feel like no one is reading the Twitter chain of comments - it could be that the gov't is blocking SWIFT or just that bitpay isn't setup to be able to use SWIFT. This isn't something they can just switch on with the bank, it can take months to get these integrations setup. I do this shit for a living and banks are the absolute worst in terms of speed of getting anything done. I've had wire integrations take months because the bank couldn't give me an enumerated list of issues with the ISO20022 file we produced so it was a constant back and forth of us guessing what the problems were.

@_date: 2018-02-08 22:52:02
I mean, that's one way to put words in my mouth. Just check my history - I support both BCH and BTC and was sad to see the split in the community. I want both bigger blocks and second layer scaling solutions and was hoping everyone would play nice and abide by the NYA and implement Segwit2X.... But if you want to live in a world where there are only big blockers and core shills you can do that but you'll be ignoring those of us in the middle
@_date: 2018-07-28 13:31:04
People here have some weird hard-on about the average joe giving a shit about private keys and blah blah blah and honestly it's both strange and deluded. Most people will never directly interact with bitcoin and not only is that ok, it's awesome. People will create layers of abstraction on top of bitcoin for the average Joe to interact with and I'm 100% ok with that. If using bitcoin requires one to actually have bitcoin and a local wallet we've failed. I'll say it again - being your own bank is a feature of bitcoin, not a requirement
@_date: 2018-07-08 06:47:28
That's exceedingly rare - the prices the other guy was quoting are what you're going to find 99.99% of the time. Hell, it costs me $60+ to rent a damn Merc GLA to head to the mountains

@_date: 2018-04-27 15:51:36
Because Bitcoin avoiding ASICboost has somehow changed the mining landscape and everything is decentralized now? Yeah, no - it was primarily an ideological disagreement on scaling solutions and there were people on both sides who stood to gain from either decision - that doesn't mean supporters of one side or the other we're doing it for personal gain (or padding the pockets of whoever your ideological boogyman is whether that's Jihan or Blockstream or whoever)

@_date: 2017-05-31 14:00:27


We're already there my man - no one is suggesting stupidly big blocks. I keep seeing small blockers bitch and moan about node operators being unable to afford bandwidth but I've never seen numbers about node operators claiming the small bandwidth increase that a blocksize doubling would bring would cause them financial ruin... it's a fucking strawman to claim node operators can't afford a small bandwidth increase and 2mb doesn't exactly require a fucking datacenter
@_date: 2015-03-19 00:34:36












lololol, absolutely nothing the *average consumer* would know how to do or bother doing. Ignoring bitcoins problems doesn't help us solve them
@_date: 2015-03-19 00:11:50
Which is why regulation is incredibly important. It gives the individual recourse. If I fuck up and someone gets my btc or they get lost I have absolutely no recourse. Putting BTC security on the end user is a recipe for disaster
@_date: 2017-05-02 15:51:01


That's because for most transactions it is no longer economical to use bitcoin
@_date: 2017-05-26 18:21:19
Why would the mempool increase from current volume? Do you believe there would be greater utilization of the network once there is a blocksize increase? Also, I would rather a few people no longer be able to afford to run a full node because the cost to do so slightly increased than our current situation where unless you are moving a large value of btc, it isn't economical to use.
@_date: 2015-03-26 14:27:38
That isn't even close to a fair or accurate comparison. With a 'cancer' it is assumed there is a normal, healthy state that the cancer is keeping the body away from. It is not objective to state that centralized authority is cancerous while asserting that *your* particular alternative is the 'healthy/normal' state. 
@_date: 2017-07-19 20:41:30
Because I trust my ability to sue Coinbase more than my ability to securely store my coins - the push to have everyone hold their own coins is fucking stupid
@_date: 2015-03-09 21:01:29
Not necessarily. If you fund Google Wallet via credit card that would be more expensive (no fee on the transaction but a fee when 'topping up' your card)
@_date: 2015-03-18 23:19:49
Yeah, why would a put my bitcoin in a wallet backed by a multimillion dollar company when I can trust myself to store it properly. Why make obtaining or selling bitcoin for fiat easy when I can get on LocalBitcoin, waste 15 minutes driving to some place to meet them and pay a 10%+ surplus. /s
@_date: 2017-05-26 12:09:21
I mean, with fees this low why wouldn't you!? /s
@_date: 2017-05-26 11:17:17
And small blocks make transactions expensive - I'd rather increase the barrier to entry for running a node (which, c'mon, 2mb isn't going to break the bank) than increase the barrier to spending btc

No, they aren't - they are the vital link between established fiat currencies and bitcoin. I love how people on here will bash centralized services and bash any attempt at regulating them in nearly the same sentence. Do you honestly think bitcoin would be worth anything if it were harder to transact between fiat and crypto?
@_date: 2017-05-26 11:27:48
I don't think ~8mb every 10min is unreasonable
@_date: 2019-05-15 23:59:35
Just as relevant as USD when paying for something on Amazon with a credit card. I've always found it weird that this community wants people to hold and personally secure BTC rather than relying on financial institutions built atop Bitcoin. My vision of the future is BTC on the backend and different front-ends for consumers centered around use cases
@_date: 2017-05-31 13:56:10
HOW? How does increasing the block size sufficiently centralize the network? How many node operators are scraping by to afford their bandwidth vs how many people are unable to use bitcoin because of stupid high fees? It's not like people want to increase the block size to 100mb...
@_date: 2017-07-19 23:15:10
Lol, Bitcoin is a long way from what it was originally intended to be. Fuck, it can't even be used as a currency right now with the retarded fees. Bitcoin *allows* me to be my own bank, it doesn't require it

@_date: 2017-06-26 00:50:05
Sure, it can't scale forever but is sure as fuck can scale on chain now and at a critical time for market propogation, having stupidly high fees ensures massive swaths of the world can't and won't use Bitcoin

Legitimize who? Casascius? because it would set a precedent that would allow for more bitcoin related businesses - it would set a threshold for what it takes to fall under FinCEN (I think we all agree that Casascius is no Coinbase and shouldn't fall under these regulations).  
Legitimize FinCen? If you want to live in a fantasy world like many bitcoiners where if you ignore a regulatory arm of the government and think that means you are depriving them of legitimate authority - be my guest but that is not the world we live in and you are deluding yourself.

The $250 price was never tested though, the second there was a large sell order - *pop!* - the current price however has been tested a few times (and we saw selloffs) and has rebounded each time and has not been nearly as catastrophic as the April correction Not to say it is impossible, but far less likely than in April.

Yeah, hell no, I'm not trusting a USB drive or hdd with hundreds of thousands of dollars. Especially in the us, the legal system is your best bet if Coinbase tries to screw you over rather than trusting yourself to securely store coins.

Yeah, a huge issue IF you don't have a car and don't live near a bank - OP would have the same issue accessing cash, this is not a bitcoin-specific complaint. Is OP honestly surprised it is difficult to do things quickly and electronically while living in bumblefuck?

Nope, but ignoring a regulatory arm does not make it disappear. We elect the officials who write the laws that make these organizations exist. Just because YOU as an individual object to it does not mean it loses its authority to regulate you - you must get a decent enough contingent of people to agree with you and craft legislation to get rid of it. Ya'know - a representative democracy.

I've only had two negative encounters with a dealer IRL both were disputes of quality - of those two encounters, one was dismissive while the other was combative (claiming he would find me downtown and randomly dose me with a large amount for talking down on his quality)  
Much like in real life, the dismissive one was just out to make money and the combative one was a 24 year old stuck with the mentality of a 14 year old - he lost a great deal of business shortly after this encounter from others who disputed the quality of his L.   
roughly 8 years and only 2 negative encounters - as far as percentages go, I've had a higher percent of negative encounters at mom and pop shops (selling legitimate goods that is)

Seriously try out other exchanges - I know MtGox wasn't the only one that got flooded today, but there are much better alternatives
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:25:14
Try out a different exchange that doesn't have such a huge queue of people signing up - I have thus far been impressed by CampBX - while it can take a while for KYC verification, simply trading can be fairly quick (initially fund with money order until ACH is setup as it takes a few days)

There is not a direct way of purchasing things on Amazon via bitcoin as they do not accept it - what you can do is buy an amazon gift card with bitcoin using Gyft. Previously, there was BitSpend which could be used to purchase things from online retailers using bitcoin; however, recently they have had their accounts frozen and have been forced to cease their operations for the time being.

It is only used for a VERY small portion of drug trafficking, money laundering, and gambling. Governments and banks have the first two down pretty well

Yeah, because the free market can solve for things like pollution... not. When we have goods being produced (and their associated harms) in an area isolated from those who purchase said goods the free market does nothing to alleviate that harm - just look at China and their pollution problem, so long as other countries are buying those goods and not the Chinese people affected by their production, it will continue. The entirity of history shows that an unregulated free-market system causes wealth to be concentrated and the poor subjected to abuse (does no one remember the late 1800's and early 1900's when regulation was nearly non-existent compared to today?)

That's awesome! - this little plugin will grab the price for you as well, it also ads the label of 'Coingig'

This is a very rough initial attempt at a Chrome extension to add a QR code that follows bitcoin URI scheme for the checkout page on Coingig to make it faster to pay for purchases especially when using a mobile wallet  
It is essentially just an implementation of [Lars Jung's jquery qrcode plugin]( and appropriate licencing info can be found on github

I'm quite certain you know what I meant by 'remember', one hardly has to go further than the first few chapters in a high school history text book to see the horrible working conditions people were forced to be in, the concentration of wealth in the hands of very few (like Carnegie), not to mention child labor (like what we currently see in less regulated markets in Asia). If you want specifics, where do you want me to start? Specific children dying from poor working conditions or something larger like the strike at Homestead?

You are only looking at one side of the equation - as someone receiving that payment it can be very difficult as there are high fees and the risk of chargeback

I second this - for some btc I could provide some clean CSS that would make this idea more pleasing to the eyes (and I can provide clean, semantic markup for spiders/screen readers)

Doesn't answer his question though - where is the brightline for what is and is not an MSB?

I really wish more people would use CampBX, correct me if I am wrong, but they have thusfar not been hacked, their infrastructure is solid (at current volume), and they are US based (granted, there is a $2 fee for ACH withdrawals - but sending a check is free)

EDIT: The KML file appears to be pulling in correctly in Earth, might I suggest making the icon a bitcoin rather than the default yellow pin?
You can try out Google Apps Script - its server-side javascript so you can have a Google form submit to a google spreadsheet and have your apps script parse that spreadsheet / clean the data / export its KML portion

There is a difference in a website/email and twitter - websites and email are product agnostic, they merely send information over an agreed upon protocol. Twitter on the otherhand is the forced using of a specific commercial product. I'm with you, A notice on their website / 
RSS Feed / Email would be the proper way to communicate with customers

At the expense of those in need - taxes aren't the problem, how they are used is. I happily pay taxes because of the good they do for those in need (I have several friends who went to college on public grants). I understand that the world would be a better place if we did not have taxes and individuals simply took care when they saw a need - but we don't live in that world. We live in a world where the haves stroll past the have-nots and don't lift a finger unless the 'big bad government' comes and 'steals' their money so the family of 5 on the other side of town can eat that night. If you think tax money is being wasted, divert your effort into reforming tax spending not denying the government what you owe

Agreed - there seems to be a collective need among all bitcoin related sites for a PR person, developers are often not the best at this sort of thing.

What? I wasn't talking about Coinbase's consumer functions (eg. buying bitcoins) I was referring to their merchant services. Bitpay has posted great numbers concerning merchants that use bitcoin for conducting sales which goes to counter 's claim that bitcoin is merely a new way of trading stocks. Speculators aren't the only people interested in bitcoin, people are actually using them to buy and sell things globally

Back when the primary (or at least as far as I knew at the time) way for me to get funds was to use bitinstant to do a cash deposit, to get a MtGox code, to redeem and then spend on bitcoins - it could be argued that it was far from mainstream viability. But now that services like Coinbase are out there it is incredibly easy to obtain bitcoins
@_date: 2013-12-04 21:10:46
I'm sure Coinbase and Bitpay would disagree with their volume in merchant services

You seem confused - while both their professional website and twitter both utilize the http/s protocol - delivering messages through a third party commercial product (twitter) as opposed to their professional website, locks users into using said commercial product - this is unprofessional and should not be a company's primary means of communication with their clients.

Because that hasn't been a risk all along? There are and have been other markets - right now the SR buyers are flocking to BMR and SheepMarketplace, the question is where are the SR vendors flowing - the bitcoin drug market didn't get shutdown, just one manifestation of it

Yes, but unlike traditional commodities - the underlying code of bitcoin can change to meet needs - assuming the majority wants it.

The internet. Much like a fax machine, the first person to get one has practically no use for it, its value is extremely low; however, once a second person gets it, it now has more value (as you can actually use it), as more people utilize it, it becomes more valuable - same story with bitcoin. Either it is adopted and its value increases or it goes down in flames like GoogleWave (which I still love)

The volatility of bitcoin makes this practically impossible - for the vast majority of individuals, the only way to acquire bitcoin is to exchange fiat for it - this in and of itself necessitates exchanges. Additionally, due to bitcoin's volatility, it is not a good store of value (the btc I acquire today may not get me as many goods or services tomorrow) and as such trading is encouraged between fiat currencies to better store value
@_date: 2013-12-25 18:20:08
The [FinCEN guidelines]( seem to indicate that the store would be an MSB albeit a small one which is why I brought up the bright line question

They are just growing pains - as btc become more and more popular, coinbase has to have more and more bitcoins on hand to sell. Their api works well, there are just more people wanting to buy btc from them than they have - as the market stabilizes, expect to see them with more an more on hand

Overall rating is horrendous, yes - but people's opinion of their [OWN congressman tells a better story](
We are already seeing a pushback to the gerrymandering that has exacerbated the issue of people not being accurately represented.

I mean, if you are trying to get cash into your account - I'd mail them a check - if you are trying to get bitcoin into your campbx account then you can purchase through whatever means you'd like (bitinstant) and send to your campbx address

Intermediaries are not inherently bad - Just think of a bitcoin bank (online wallet) that always sent from green addresses ( to remove any mistrust until the payment is verified - this would be a good thing for the bitcoin ecosystem. The problem is that currently, there are very few intermediaries so these large multinational banks run everything, they need to be busted up like the telecom companies were
