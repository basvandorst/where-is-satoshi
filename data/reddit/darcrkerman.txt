Definitely test the heat transference of the materials your using. Electronics don't normally hold up in fire safes, they are too sensitive. You should expect it to die if it gets hotter than 80C, possibly lower temps even.

It's extremely easy.   
You just go on aliexpress, contact the seller, give them your design, pay them. Wait a couple weeks and you'll have have a few hundred of them cheaply.   
A lot of businesses use these, it's not a niche product.

that's why you jump on a trampoline...   
You don't just bounce on it, you use your muscles. 
You can even see the the character in the cartoon jumped by how their feet are pointed.
I feel like you've never been on a trampoline.

"87,00" he left out a zero...

i know you're joking. But if he meant $87, he would have made three character mistakes, the "," and the two "0". If he meant $87,000 it's just the one character mistake of the "0". The likelihood of making three character mistakes in a row is very unlikely by comparison.

if it were true it'd be a big deal.Chinese have already popularly accepted digital payment methods (wechat), and hiding income from taxes is popular. I doubt it's true though.
