This is why Bitcoin will eventually replace fiat.  It's yours.  You don't need a bank's permission.  It's easier and cheaper to use.
It really reminds me of email in the early '90s.  I was trying to get everyone to use it, and they were like, "Nah dude, it's weird. Just fax me."  Then they use it once, and they're like, "Oh, yeah, that is better."
Thanks for sharing the story.  It's a small window into the future.

You don't need much technological understanding to use Coinbase.

Even I have to agree that it's dumb.  They're not communists.  They're more like slaveholders.
@_date: 2018-05-06 02:18:20
Well, that will be true in a sense because the anti-establishment roots of it will be dead, but unlike raves, the people who had the real thing, back before it was popular, actually get rich in something beyond experience.
@_date: 2018-05-12 03:19:50
No.  It's a whale manipulating the market, dumping tons of coins, a lot more coins than 8,200.  Probably a banker type.  Definitely someone who doesn't mind losing money and hates Bitcoin.

There's no such thing as a secret Facebook group. Facebook is the scourge of humanity.  Natives sold Manhattan for a handful of trinkets because they didn't understand the value of land.  People sell their souls to Facebook because they don't understand the value of privacy. If I know everything about you, I basically own you. Facebook knows everything about you. 
I really hope there's still something like raves going on, maybe organized on Telegram or the like.

Let's see, that would be a .13 BTC, 13 million satoshis.  That will be enough to retire on in a few years.
@_date: 2018-05-28 18:50:47
Bitcoin has been dismissed by non-visionaries and rivals for much longer than Amazon was.  Bitcoin will probably outlast Amazon too and will almost certainly have a more profound effect on society.  It's hard to see right now, but we are participating in one of the most significant phenomena in both financial and technological history.  You'll see it in just a few years.
@_date: 2018-05-09 11:26:08
I agree and think drugs should be legal.  BUT if you break the law and get caught, you should expect to be punished.  I think a few years in prison and big fines would have been appropriate, not life in prison.

You can't withdraw Bitcoin or fiat?
@_date: 2018-05-06 21:06:48
That's freakin' awesome!
@_date: 2018-05-09 19:46:14
Wow! Look at how low those fees are! Try transferring that much money using a bank.  You'll pay at least 10x as much.
Sorry you lost your money, dude.  Hang on to those other 10 BTC.
@_date: 2018-05-04 19:08:53
My grandmother would have it down in one minute flat if I showed her how. "Open the wallet, hit the big "Receive" button, let the customer scan your code." I don't know, maybe my grandmother is smarter than yours.  My mom sure is; she loves Bitcoin.
Maybe you should reconsider blabbing about things you've never tried.
@_date: 2018-05-17 01:36:24
OK. So what? Has Bitcoin ever suffered a buffer overflow attack? No? What makes you think Lightning is vulnerable? Are you smarter than the ace coders all over the world that have been developing it for years?
Who the fuck cares what language you use? Shit code is shit code.

Do you know how easy it is to accept Bitcoin directly? All you need is a wallet.  You don't need a merchant processor or anything like that.  The fact that they're offering a 20 percent discount indicates that they're doing it in a direct way.
@_date: 2018-05-02 21:14:06
So that money is a truer representation of value and can't just be created out of thin air and given to the already-rich, especially for purposes of mass blood sacrifice (war).  
Decentralized, cryptographically signed ledger is the best form of money ever invented, and it will take over because it's better.
@_date: 2018-05-04 13:07:34
Less overhead in processing the payment, knowledge that nobody will pay in Bitcoin unless they get a discount since the value will always go up over time.
@_date: 2018-05-06 21:09:31
So not true.  The network is fine right now.  I just sent somebody a tiny amount of BTC. Fee was ridiculously small, and the transaction confirmed in ten minutes.
@_date: 2018-05-05 13:11:10
It is easy.  Easier than setting up a credit card terminal.  Just a matter of adoption.
@_date: 2018-05-13 22:51:30
Wow.  Seriously powerful stuff.
I wonder if they've figured out that they're the rats yet.

It will be back there sooner than you think, newb.  
And have you heard of throwaway accounts? They're great.

How would they do that in Argentina?
@_date: 2018-05-04 13:06:12
Exactly right, and this is where things are going.  In the not-so-distant future, more and more businesses will prefer the superior money. In 2021 it will be like $100 or .0000001 BTC for a cup of coffee. By 2023, the idea of selling Bitcoin for dollars will seem absolutely absurd.
@_date: 2018-05-06 02:02:08
Roughly the same... similar.

So you've never actually used Bitcoin?  It's very easy, much easier than a credit card. Honestly, I don't know why anyone uses Bitpay or Coinbase other than to perhaps make accounting easier.
@_date: 2018-05-06 14:28:21
Yeah, it's funny that he's actually right.  He just doesn't realize who the rats are.
@_date: 2018-05-12 03:15:24
Have you ever used Bitcoin? It's been in use for nine years.  It's not a beta test. It's a great way to send and save money.
@_date: 2018-05-06 02:20:30
It's kind of like what Green Day (and the many "punk" bands that came after them) did to punk rock.  It became popular, but it wasn't really punk anymore.
I've been to "raves" recently, and they're not raves.  Raves were underground by definition, hard to find, illegal, etc.
@_date: 2018-05-09 01:49:07
I think he probably did deserve some kind of punishment for facilitating illegal activities, but the punishment he got does not fit the "crime."

Coinbase is pretty easy for people who don't know what they're doing, and they're FDIC insured for fiat and Lloyd's insured for your coins.
@_date: 2018-05-09 23:53:44
Use your local exchanges. Even Nigeria has them, for Christ's sake.  If you can't figure out how to buy and sell Bitcoin, you're always going to be poor because stupid people end up poor even if they start off rich.
@_date: 2018-05-09 15:00:59
Funny you mention your mom.  My mom has some coin on Coinbase.  Doesn't seem to be a problem for her.  She even used it to pay for a plane ticket.

@_date: 2018-05-16 16:07:36
Oh, there are other very legitimate reasons.
@_date: 2018-05-05 01:43:07
Within five years at most.  It's dead simple to set this up and a lot cheaper than setting up a credit card processing rig. 
The other step are the wallets which are already being developed.  Tap-pay is the future, and we're going to cut out the ~~parasites~~ middlemen.
@_date: 2018-05-09 13:14:23
Poor financial decisions? The only poor financial decision I made was not buying more.  Also selling some cheap (albeit with a 500 percent gain)...
@_date: 2018-05-06 02:07:09
That's the beauty of it.  When it goes down, you're happy because you can get more for your fake fiat money.  When it goes up, you're obviously happy.
The "buy the dips and hodl" thing works over time. I'm living proof, and I'm sure there are many others on this sub as well.
@_date: 2018-05-06 14:30:22
He's not a smart investor.  He's a salesman.  He missed all the biggest investment opportunities -- Apple, Google, Amazon -- and just collected mass amounts of money from people to buy blue chips.  He is totally overrated, and he's been wrong every time he opened his stupid trap about Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-05-06 02:04:21
Yup.  "When" is the word, too, not "if."

U.S. tax laws do incentivize long term hodling, but most people are too stupid to understand that.  If I sell Bitcoin at a profit before holding it for a year, I pay normal income tax (30+ percent in my bracket), but if I hold for a year and a day and sell, I pay a capital gain tax of 15 percent.  If my income were lower, it could even be 0.
But most of the dipshits over at don't seem to understand that.  Apparently they like either losing money or paying high taxes.
@_date: 2018-05-06 02:00:17
They do that in Brazil and Mexico, probably other places too.

Do you realize how easy it is to directly accept Bitcoin?  I would say there is a significantly greater than 0% chance, especially since they're offering a discount.

I have the intention of purchasing everything with Bitcoin in a few years.  I never intend to sell it for dollars.
@_date: 2018-05-12 13:36:15
Is this some "beta" thing some kind of anti-Bitcoin talking point? I see it so much that it makes me wonder.  Bitcoin is not in beta.  It's been in fairly wide use for eight years.  Billions of dollars worth of value are transferred using Bitcoin every day.  It's never been hacked outside of one time when it really was in beta in 2010. It's rock solid.  It's ALPHA.

Let's put this "genius investor" myth to rest:  His returns are terrible.  Berkshire Hathaway underperforms most plain vanilla mutual funds.  The only reason Buffett is rich is that he gave himself a bunch of free shares and sold a bunch of shares to his daddy's buddies.  Any monkey could get better returns by buying an index fund.

Put it this way: If I had bought a Honda's worth of Bitcoin 2 years ago, I'd have a couple Lambos worth now.

I'm calling bullshit. It is not "known" that "80-90% of BTC trading is wash trading."

You can call it what you want, but if I OWE you, it is a debt, whether or not there is a written contract.  If the words on the paper are true, all providers of goods and services should be required to accept cash to settle any amounts owed.
