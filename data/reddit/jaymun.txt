Its great that bitcoin and dogecoing have so many people donating, but can someone explain why this is? Is there some benefit to donating with bitcoin that stopped so many people from making donations before they could use bit/dogecoins for it?

Well yeah, but that's just true with any addiction, the rational thought process doesn't win out.
Do you think people who are addicted to crack think to themselves 'man, this could really destroy my life and I could lose all my money to this. Oh well, I've thought it out and the benefits outweigh the risks"?
