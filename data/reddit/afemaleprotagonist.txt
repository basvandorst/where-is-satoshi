Now is a bad time for transactions. Transaction times are waaaaaaaaay up.
@_date: 2017-11-30 02:09:39
That's the way I see it. Bitcoin has only just begun it's rise. As more and more people want in, the value is going to sjyrocket, even if only 2 or 3% of the world uses it, that's still gonna be remarkable.

Also, u/mortimer452 just suggested Blockfolio on the Google play store, it looks promising!

The only good investment advice is only buy what you can afford to lose.
@_date: 2017-11-05 04:37:37
Well, I'm not OP, but thanks! I'm currently using electrum. I actually only bought a few days ago (I didn't have any money back when bitcoin was ~$100...wish I'd had a job in high school). And then paid the damn fees from coinbase to transfer it. And now I gotta transfer it back. 
Thus is why you do your reading ahead of time haha

Whoops, that must have happened as a result of when I was deleting my own information. I'll message you in just a suck with an unprotected and fixed version.

Oh I totally believe in it. I think bitcoin is a revolution that's just getting started.

Can I ask why would it be bad to keep in hardware during the fork?
@_date: 2017-11-16 00:51:44
Hmmmm. Bitcoin, but you mine it by using your tears to generate hydroelectric power and pay for electricity.
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:17:40
Apparently all the miners left bitcoin for bitcoin cash, which means the transactions aren't being processed. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 21:16:24
Same tbh

Kind stranger, you have made my day. Or night. Whichever it happens to be right now.
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:08:42
Oh man I totally get this. I heard about it in 2012 and I was just like a 10th grader. Figuring out how to buy or mine bitcoin was too complicated for me, and I didn't even really understand what the blockchain was at all.

Not intelligence. It has HSI, Homeland Security intelligence, but the majority of other intel agencies are outside of DHS. Most of the intelligence agencies (including the ones in the heirarchy of other agencies, such as HSI with DHS) are also under DNI, director of national intelligence.
And to add, to give a better understanding:
DHS really has a "few" primary offices- customs and border protection (handles ports of entry, airports, land borders, seaports), Border Patrol (Only has jurisdiction within 100 miles of the border), Citizenship and Immigration Services, Transportation Security Agency (TSA does air, rail, highway, and pipeline security), the Coast Guard, FEMA (Federal Emergency Management Agency), and Secret Service (protect the president, but a less known fact is that they handle transnational financial crimes).

Some people have mentioned a site for speeding up your transaction by adding more to the fee (or something), I can't remember the name off the top.of my head though.

I'll admit, I came in like an idiot, starting just before and during the last dip. Since I first bought, I've done so much reading and watched so many videos to take my head out of my ass and better understand bitcoin, both as an "investment" and a currency. I've always supported bitcoins vision since I first heard of it in like 2013, but I was pretty young and couldn't figure out how wallets / mining really worked at the time. I'm glad I know more now.

Or if on the default reddit app, go to the sub and click the options tab in the upper right and click "community information" or something like that.

This is the one I have seen posted, not sure if it's a scam or not but lots of people have referenced it.

People get nervous because of these crashes. They're kind of a self reinforcing thing. They worry that this new all time high is the last all time high and they start panic selling. 
Limit orders are for buying below current price, but also for selling above it. So if the price gets pushed to 11k and there's a huuuge limit order from a whale, a major sell off happens because 1 person sold a lot. But then lots of newer people see "oh no, it's crashing, I'd better cash out while I have the chance."
@_date: 2017-11-05 15:17:57
Ah, thanks.

Do something huge and humanitarian, get our names plastered into every major newspaper, get free exposure for bitcoin AND fight the negative "it's for criminals" stereotype.
@_date: 2017-11-29 13:13:00
Invest in things you understand and things which you believe have a decent competitive edge over others.
Invest only after doing research.
Invest only with money you can afford to lose.
Invest long term, don't fall to emotions. No matter what haooens, HODL.
@_date: 2017-11-13 05:32:43
Either way, I'm glad to hopefully be of service. If there are things my spreadsheet doesn't do that you'd like it to, let me know and I'll see what I can do.
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:20:38
It shouldn't be, no. If you're sure it's sent to the right place, it'll get there eventually. I sent from my wallet probably 4 hours ago, and still haven't got even one confirmation.

Who's mum are you?
@_date: 2017-11-29 13:37:26
The flipside of that is that these new people are less experienced and don't understand that there will be large dips once in a while. That's why the panic in a lot of cases, because they haven't done enough research, so even smaller dips can make them panic sell. 
I'd say that we're going to see signficantly more volatility for the next month or two at least, which will probably involve one or two larger dips. Take my advice with a grain of salt though, I'm still relatively new to crypto (bought in early november, but I've known about it since 2012 or so).
@_date: 2017-11-10 14:56:25
I keep seeing this advice around. Why is it important to have it out of the exchanges?
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:05:08

Something else of note for people reading this thread: if you are interested in government jobs which require security clearances, pay the tax. Fishy financials is a big reason for clearance denial.

Ooo part of the 1 club.

I'm not very diversified yet, but one coin that I've been looking at lately is Dash. Check out r/dashpay, read their faq and read their posts, and do some research of your own on it. Dash is discredited by a large portion of the crypto base, but I think that's mostly because they can see it as a competitor. Dash is more streamlined for everyday use, is self governing, and the miners don't completely control the blockchain lile they do with bitcoin. It fixes a few problems that bitcoin has, both technically and structurally.

This thread went from two people answering different things (one being right) to everyone responding about how someone was wrong �� I wasn't expecting 10 notifications so soon.

What is HODL? I keep seeing this term around.

Not op, but my biggest issue with a Tesla is the fact that they have software limitations despite having the exact same hardware. It's a very scummy approach, imo. I'm buying the same care, it should either be the same price and have the same range.
Edit: just because it's common practice doesn't make it better, in my books
@_date: 2017-11-18 00:12:01
It does make perfect business sense. It's just anticonsumer. It doesn't increase their costs to remove range limits, it just decreases your ability to use the product that you purchased. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 04:44:37
Ooo. Is GDAX as much of a pain in the ass to set up as coinbase was?
