Bitcoin is a protocol, it's not the same thing as an electronic or other forms of tech. Old protocols tend to stick around and be built upon.

You could watch an err.. well an ultra wide adult film lets just say.

I disagree Calerone, Bitcoin has a ton of sex appeal unlike fiat currency. ;)
Seriously I don't expect my crypto designs to be used on a catwalk. If however you want to spread the word about Bitcoin then this is a good option. I can imagine this backpack would also attract a lot of attention at events etc so I think there's some uses.

It's a great song and I encourage you guys listen to the full song. I think the lyrics perfectly symbolise Bitcoin vs the Fiat system.

As you all know the Bitcoin space is full of lots of interesting  controversial characters. I’ve been working on a new series where  influencers, public figures and coins battle it out in a satirical /  over the top video game fighting format.
I will  source comments, news and interesting topics in the Bitcoin space to piece together fun story lines / battles for each episode. At the moment I’ve  already setup several characters and I’m open to suggestions.
* Satoshi Nakamoto
* Craig Wright
* John McAfee
* Max Keiser
* Wincklevoss Twins
* Warren Buffet
* Andreas Antonopoulos

This design is not finalised and I plan to create a dark/light versions too. I think it would be interesting to create some merch for altcoins too. I'm posting here as I would like your ideas.
@_date: 2018-05-02 18:33:53
Yeah I'm already planning to create a design more along those lines too. This bag is more of a Bitcoin promotional tool for events etc, I'll be more subtle/stylish with future designs.

Thanks for your input. I have updated my post just to mention the fact this is not my video. 
I realise I might miss out on important points since I'm no expert, which is why I thought I would post here to get second opinions. 
@_date: 2018-05-02 11:45:08
Do you agree or not that exchanges have raised the Bitcoin prices? I've seen a lot of conflicting views so I'm curious to get some Reddit perspective.
Edit: FYI this is not my video. I'm just trying to learn and see if there's flawed logic/reasoning in the video.

Where did people get the stacks of money? I mean did jobs pay out larger sums of money, was it savings?

Mortgages are a scam, you dont own the property until it's full paid off. It's better to just rent property and have the freedom to move whenever you like.

Why would they remove your blinds when they already scan houses with thermal sensors and night vision.

What's funny is that you took it seriously

Naturally I would research after recieving some initial feedback. Many articles written online are written for SEO, selling a product or have an agenda just as anyone in the community might.

What is Bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-10-06 20:04:23
bitcoininnovators.com is another alternative, I set up the forum before the all these issues but I haven't promoted it yet.
@_date: 2013-12-01 23:23:14
Maybe people have been planning to "cash out" once it hits December. The price will rise soon though, I just wish I had the FIAT to buy more coins. :/
@_date: 2013-10-06 20:34:47
Take a look over at BitcoinInnovators.com, I created the forum before all these issues and it is basically a totally fresh forum with a clean minimal layout.
