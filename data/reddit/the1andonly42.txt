All these who regret not buying probably didn't understand the vision and the risk/reward. Like why would you sell at 100m market cap? Do you not think it will go up and what's stopping it?

I don't know if you misspelled. I mean RaiBlocks(XRB). It's basically a perfect crypto with a market cap of only $500m. Look into it.
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:16:13
Well if *most* people are doing $100 investments, then find out that $30 goes to a fee, I think it would cause some uproar making them do some research which, hopefully, opens them up to the other cryptos.

Seriously the only reason to invest in Bitcoin atm is because dumb money is pouring in to Bitcoin. Bitcoin's a brand. A gateway into cryptos. It will change when the dumb money gets educated more over the time when they start to see other cryptos mentioned on the media. Smart money is also in Bitcoin since they know Bitcoin isn't going to slow down any time soon.

If IOTA will work with m2m, then what stops it from working as p2p? Focusing on the IoT part is a good way to get a strong Tangle set up, since companies involved with the IoT aspect will most likely be running many nodes. Once Tangle is big and strong enough, it can very well be used as p2p as well. Heck if they release the UCL wallet(unless there's still some reattaching thin), you can already use it as a p2p without major complications(afaik).
XRB on the other hand is already working as a decentralised, 0 fee, scalable, nearly instant crypto currency, so imo unless IOTA will remove coordinator fast(and wallet works easily like any other wallet), XRB will be used as a p2p for now.
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:39:24
I'm not invested in Bitcoin. Mainly because it's not scalable aka the more people use it, the bigger the fees get etc. They say Lightning Network will help, but from my own research, I don't think so.
Bitcoin (at the start when it didn't yet face scalability issues)is a good vision on how a currency should be: decentralised, fast, low fees, max supply cap, borderless, you control your money. Try accessing $100k from anywhere in the world within minutes. Only problem for Bitcoin is again the fact that it doesn't scale well. Nakamoto hoped that in the future someone is going to solve the scalability problem.
I personally believe that DASH, XRP, IOTA and XRB(or atleast one of them) will become the main crypto currencies actually used as currencies.
Their will be a crypto currency in the future that will be used as a currency whether you like it or not. Another 2008 kind of crash and people will be even more against the government and the banks.
@_date: 2017-12-27 23:24:44
No one knows the future doesn't mean that future can't be predicted *quite* accurately. 
I see so many posts saying "I wish I had held BTC in 2011, but I sold it because it raised 20x" etc. The guys who held through all of those rises and dips very likely researched about Bitcoin and it's technology and understood why it was an important project.
Now we have new opportunities because Bitcoin is facing scalability problems which Lightning Network can't fix without making it more centralised and vulnerable to KYC regulations(as much as I have researched). Meaning that scalable cryptos like XRB, IOTA maybe even Dash will have a good chance to rise and some day dethrown Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-03 19:22:53
I could see maybe Blockchain technology utilised in voting somehow to make it transparent, but still private, so you can't see how other voted. Like you could be assigned an address(like ID number) and later you can look that address up on the blockchain to see if your vote went were it needed.
I think they can't rig it more by 15% max otherwise it'll become obvious no? Sooner or later the guys managing the systems would spill the beans.

Look up Austrian vs Keynesian economic models. If a person gets paid with BTC and they need to pay rent with a BTC, will they rather hold their BTC knowing it will go up while living on the streets or pay the fucking rent? I can 100% bet that a person will rather choose to buy food and pay rent than to die holding their "money".
Keynesian is a fucked up system, you can't save money, you have to invest it so it would hold value atleast. Try investing 100$. Fees plus the hassle and the risks only to gain a 5% a year meanwhile house prices are up 20% and groceries atleast 2%.
Wages have to be made bigger, which is a whole other hassle.

Are you here to learn about cryptos or just warn of a doomsday and practice ignorance? The characteristics of cryptos I listed is what backs crypto currencies. 
You can warn people about putting their loans into cryptos, but calling every crypto a scam just because you like how the $ devalues every year and is controlled by a Federal Reserve(private company) that can't even be audited, is just being a hypocrite.

Well you can think what you want, but when new people buying in on Bitcoin see the $30 fees, they would probably look at the other cryptos as well.
I'm starting to see other cryptos getting mentioned on the news as well, although rarely, but it's a start I guess.
Remember, that this is the first year where crypto market has grown exponentially and started to really get media coverage. In the past month I've seen more news about crypto than the past 9 years.

I agree, but Bitcoin doesn't have any solutions for the scalability problem while other projects like Ripple, IOTA, DASH are already developing and testing. LN is just too complicated for mass adoption.
What I meant is that new people invest in Bitcoin just because it's going up, not because of it's technological capabilities and future development plans. So my guess is it will take about a year before people start really questioning Bitcoin more.

You forgot the fact that Bitcoin's sole purpose is to be used as money. It's not like a stock since it's not a piece of a company that generates revenue. Bitcoin needs a stable price and the only way I see it being stable is if a lot of people start using it and that won't happen if I can't even buy basic stuff with it.

Yea until there comes a point where the masses realize that btc is actually quite inferior tech wise and they will probably buy a coin that has the tech needed for taking over fiat, since that % rise is going to be yuuuge.
@_date: 2017-11-27 10:35:15
Other thing is that Bitcoins tech seems to be inferior to other coins. Scalability, decentralization(china controlling majority etc), fees. Satoshi's Bitcoin started the vision, but it's likely that some other crypto *currency* will finish it.
@_date: 2017-11-27 17:36:31
The bitcoins were mined. Everyone had the opportunity to mine bitcoins, but many didn't bother because they were probably too lazy/narrow minded. If you are one of the developers working on a revolutionary technology, you most likely mined a lot back then, which is justified, because you worked on the project as well. 
Satoshi Nakamoto, if he even is a real person, has the most bitcoins across multiple wallets that we have public addresses to. The bitcoins have not been moved and I think the "genesis" blocks that he mined, the bitcoins gotten from that can not be spent.
Why does it even matter to you that developers who worked for free own more bitcoins? Do you even care that your bank is holding your money and might gamble it once in a while? You're talking like a Rothchild created bitcoin.

Well there is the fact that it's been used for thousands of years combined with the utility that I mentioned before, the store of value is backed by all of these.

Does btc actually have the tech to scale? I always see in this subreddit "if btc goes to xyz" what will make it go there? As far as I know it needs mass adoption aka stores accepting btc and people actually prefering to use it (not the case because of the growing fees). Just because btc has gone up doesn't mean it will surely continue going up.
I'm not here to bash btc, I really want to know why people think like this.

Gold is backed by it's electricity conduction, jewels are made from gold, it has a history of thousands of years etc. Only thing that keeps bitcoin going is that it was the first.
Since bitcoin can't get mass adoption, it will be overtaken by a coin that can. Once that happens, anything can happen. I just wouldn't see the point investing in btc when there is a coin at the  spot that has the tech to take over fiat.
@_date: 2017-11-27 10:36:47

Please leave your hate against millenials for other subreddits or atleast use "Majority". I can also say that Veterans, Baby boomers were so stubborn that they couldn't see and fix the major flaws in the education system and now we have this outdated system. In reality depends on the person.
If you look into Bitcoin, you can understand it's not a pyramid scheme. It was made to overtake fiat, so we would have a currency that doesn't have a 3% yearly inflation, is decentralized, borderless and much more. Really 8 years of work for a pyramid scheme?
If there will be a coin that has a much better tech(scalability, low fees etc), then we might see Bitcoin falling off if Bitcoin can't upgrade it's technology.
