I know. I wish there was a way of intoning typed text so that it was easier to tell when people are being sardonic.

Yeah why the fuck didn’t you sell at 19k?? No offense, you’d just be rollin’ right now if you did.

Got me good damn. Touché lol. Now you see that I am not much of an Einstein.

I met an old man who is cashing his retirement account and investing in bitcoin. He was totally convinced it would replace fiat and was going to end up running the world economy before his 75 year old ass died. This was back during the endless bull run of the past few months. Talk about a ballsy gamble! He could end up like all those Bernie Madoff ppl if btc happens to crash to nothing. I would never invest my retirement in such a volatile future...

Spoken like someone who didn’t spend 13k in 2017 usd on a medium veggie pizza.

No you spent $25 on a cocktail. I spent roughly 0.7 bitcoins on a pizza delivery. Your brother’s gambling winnings are not an equivalent logical parallel to hyperdeflation, but I get the point you are trying to make.

True that thanks for the moral support lol. I actually was a Gox user so I would’ve gotten screwed one way or the other. I also tried to jump back on the ship when it surged to 800 but panic sold on the crash. Cryptos have not been kind to me. Or I am just stupid. Either way I should’ve hodled.

God damn fucking Silkroad. By 2017 standards I have spent over a million US dollars on drugs at this point. Should have just kept my coins. I remember back when you could spend 3 or 4 entire bitcoins on a bag of weed or some primo acid via DNM. I EVEN BOUGHT A PIZZA WITH A BITCOIN IN EARLY 2010 WHAT THE FUCK WAS I THINKING?!?!

YES! I remember I was a broke ass college student perusing the internet for ways to spend the last .6 btc I had because I thought it was basically worthless e-money that was only for nerds who want to dabble in the black market (like me). I finally found a site called foodler that took my bitcoins in exchange for delivery from local restaurants. I remember clearly that “where can I spend this god damn e-money, I’m starving and I wish I could just flip it back into dollars” was going through my head. 
Each slice of that pizza I bought was worth more than a thousand dollars in present day money. Cue up the Curb Your Enthusiasm theme song because I am a schmuck.
