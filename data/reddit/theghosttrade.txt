Me. In Canada, and since I'm not with a major bank, I can't buy any anymore. I used to be able to do straight cash deposits. 
I wish I could, and I'm verified with Cavirtex now, but as far as I can tell, it's completely impossible. Even with Quickbit, it asks which major bank I'm affiliated with to use my Interac debit card. I'm with a credit union.
And my opinion on bitcoin has changed a little, as in the OP. I was never a libertarian to begin with, but the circlejerking on this sub has turned me off it a little. 
Still wish It was possible to buy them though.

Stop trying so hard to sound smart that your sentences become meaningless. That is partly what I was referring to. 
And there is very much a *'taxation is theft, all government is bad, bitcoin will reach the moon'* circlejerk here.

And [unobtanium]( is trading for millions then. It's 85x rarer than bitcoin, so I guess it's over 42500 times as rare as gold

The first "central bank" was created in 1694, in England. Before that, the concept simply didn't exist.
As for fiat money, oldest recorded use is around 1000 AD, in China, and didn't reach Europe until the mid 1600's. 
Commodity money (gold/silver) != fiat money (usually paper)

I've seen a lot of charitable work done over there using doge, and I just really can't see that happening on this sub, despite people making a lot more money with bitcoins than with doge.

It does actually.
1:  in a literal sense or manner:  actually &lt;*took the remark literally*&gt; &lt;*was literally insane*&gt;
2: in effect:  **virtually** &lt;*will literally turn the world upside down to combat cruelty or injustice — Norman Cousins*&gt;
Literally has been used in the second sense since the late 17th century. And languages aren't (and shouldn't be) static and unchanging.

Much simpler than english. It's grammar, syntax, etc is pretty standardized. And if you speak a romance language, it's incredibly easy to learn.

There is *no* Ebola in Ghana (literally not a single case this year), HIV prevalence is at 0.8%, and Ghana has some of the fastest internet in Africa. 
The Global Hunger Index lists Ghana as one of the least "hungry" places in Africa. 
Stop with the racist generalizations. Africa isn't a singular place where no one has a computer, and everyone is dying of AIDS and Ebola.

Cell phones.
My parents work with rural communities in the mountains of south america, and there's villages where there's no plumbing, internet, and sometimes not even landline phones, but people will still have cell phones.
Not smart phones, but old style cell phones.
Those people don't have bank accounts, most of them are subsistence farmers, and make something like $30 bucks a month.
Not that bitcoin would be of any use to them either.

Gold also has a 6000 year history of being a valuable metal.

Still not great sometimes. I got something like 20/80 up/downvotes once for saying I wouldn't use bitcoin for tax evasion, and got called a statist pig.
But it's better.

Everything? It's literally impossible for me to buy bitcoins, and I live in Canada.

How much did you make? 
@_date: 2013-12-19 20:56:54
when I checked yesterday it was the 13th biggest altcoin. After reading an article where it was the 24th biggest.
*number 8 now.
*back to 13. doge is in freefall
Bigger than megacoin and feathercoin. Implementation is similar to Litecoin.
1 Doge is worth very little though, as the max number of coins will be 100 billion.
@_date: 2013-11-22 22:44:29
I don't see the value of bitcoin dropping to *zero*. Cryptocurrencies will always have black market uses. I think they're currently overvalued though. 
@_date: 2013-10-21 01:45:57

fair. I could see bitcoin being replaced by some other cryptocurrency. 
@_date: 2013-10-15 02:48:38
deflationary is also not good as is disencourages spending. 
@_date: 2013-12-21 06:23:58
Bitcoin doesn't have any intristic value either though. Neither does gold for that matter. All those things only have value because we think they do.

But if the market cap goes down to the value of say, craftcoin, then they're essentially worthless. Or not quite, but $0.007 a bitcoin. I'm not even arguing it will go down that much. I don't think it will. I don't even know if it will go down to double digits again in the foreseeable future.
But Bitcoin isn't inherently more valuable than any other crypto. The coins are only worth as much as they are right now because we think they're worth that much.
*Just like dollars.*

yes it is. The price of nearly anything bought with bitcoin is pegged to another currency. 
if you actually use it as a currency, you essentially have to spend them immediately or else you risk losing money.
