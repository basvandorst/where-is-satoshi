So, I finished up a webinar for this company after attracting me with an off-world transaction method.
Why it interested me so much::
I learned that customers will securely access their data and perform financial transactions in their satellites from their Internet enabled mobile device, tablet or laptop.  
This will be accomplished by a ConnectX device that plugs in to a wireless router.  The system transmits data in an entirely new and highly secure method.
No data is ever stored on any server or device on earth eliminating the use of the Internet entirely.  The system gives the customer the ability to do financial and smart contract transactions with unparalleled security.
One example for a "use case" would be International Commodity Trading. ConnectX has created a Demo Product Module called Exportly.IO.
Exportly uses the blockchain as the intermediary between international buyers and sellers of commodities reducing costs by 15-50% by eliminating traders, brokers and banks.  Trading goods between countries is a $12-15 Trillion per year market.
Using their "S1W" Secure Digital Wallet Storage -
Vital to Exportly is the ability for customers to store their digital currency wallets and other information related to the international commodity trade transaction.  ConnectX coin sale participants will also use this application to store their digital wallets and purchase ConnectX coins.
