Usage will pick up, the benefits are too great not to. We think it's an investment tool, but for a large portion of the world, it's financial freedom. Once the scaling problem is addressed and we can get to reasonable transaction fees, usage will pick up, price should really be a backseat to the freedom benefits.

I didn't even realise bitcoin was mentioned until after I got into crypto. The signs were there from season 2, meaning there are probably quite a few people who make the show that invested early and probably bought at sub $1000 prices.

+$3,000 in 24 hours is ridiculous. The rest of the world must be looking at this like a complete joke, a bad joke that they're not in on.
I predicted 20k by christmas a week ago, I didn't expect it to actually happen. I'm just gonna hodl my very small amount (less than 0.1) and wait for all this to blow over

The sentiment from my original post is one from first hand account. I bought a few copies of the Zeitgeist Movement Defined to give to friends and family. Similar in fashion to what OP is doing. 
Years later in casual discussions I find that no-one read any of them. No one wanted to know about a Resource Based Economy, which coincidentally is very in line with what the future of bitcoin/blockchain could lead to

There is no logical way this would work right now without a complete financial breakdown in the interim, which would mean a lot of deaths and a lot of stress while the whole structure is rebuilt. A nice concept but so far away from feasible.

My rule is I only buy 1 a month, the last Friday of each month (if I remember to). I'm not looking to win the numbers, I'm going for the raffle. Every ticket has a guaranteed Millionaire raffle which is much higher odds than ever matching numbers. I sometimes forget to buy most months if I don't find myself in a shop around the last Friday, so I'd say I buy maybe 10 a year. (£2.50 a ticket)
£25 a year is a price I'm willing to waste for a slim chance of changing my life

It's not about the use, although it really is as easy as sending it to an address. 
It's about everything it stands for, it's an alternative to conventional fiat, which may not be important to a guy in America, but to a guy in Venezuela or any dictatorship is immensely important.
Financial freedom, backed by a powerful array of decentralised miners securing the network and making it nigh impossible to game or hack with current technology. Another immensely important feature
Broaden your perspective to the implications this has, fiat is rife with inflation and the debt cycle is running its course. Be glad we have this as an alternative
