He was talking about light clients!
@_date: 2018-01-30 18:54:16
LukeJr said Litecoin is a scam, reference:
@_date: 2018-01-19 05:10:46
but looks like hub and spoke :( 
not very decentralized.
@_date: 2018-01-31 18:28:21
High fees kill ATMs
@_date: 2018-01-10 15:22:40
Is there a roadmap for LN?
@_date: 2018-01-10 16:38:13
Do I also have to pay fees when I close the channel, how often do I need to close it?
If its 20 usd to open, and 20 to close it. Fees could add up very fast.
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:25:33
I bet each girl made a small fortune
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:21:20
Fuck Coinbase , they mother fuckers pumping Btrash cash. Les reduce the blocksize now and show them value of decentralization. I vote we recude blocksize to 250Kb/.
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:45:51
ok sorry
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:34:33
no, but girls in video very probably
@_date: 2017-12-03 06:04:37
Fees are very high righ now, try to use Segwit addresses to minimize the effects. It will be better in 2 years when the Lighting Network is fully deployed
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:14:00
Bitcoin Debit cards were priced out by fees.
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:35:48
yes, I think is good example
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:28:03
yes, fuck Coinbase shit. Like famous indian movie Two girls one cupe we fuck them. Why price Bcash Btras goes up so much?
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:26:27
LukeJr is very smart, he wants to reduce size. I think 250Kb is reasonable but we can go lower.
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:31:05
pay with Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:33:58
yes, fuck them like in famous movie two girls one cup./

his smarter than you
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:24:53
No  big blocks stupid, we decentralize. Better make blogs smaller. I vote we reduce block to 250Kb. Price will go 4x to the Moon my friend.
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:46:29

@_date: 2017-12-20 05:23:02

@_date: 2017-12-20 04:54:13

this is possible? How much
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:17:08

@_date: 2017-12-19 20:12:59
Ok so first they need to finish Lighitng Nework, then make many test to lower hacks. Then Wallets need to update, then service providers need to update. This is going to take some time. Wallets and service providers havent event update to Segwit. Not even Core wallet supports Segwit!
@_date: 2017-12-26 22:53:00
great, now we just need wallets to support Segwit.
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:33:08

@_date: 2017-12-20 04:24:02
yes pissed shit, like famous movie. Google Two girls one cup we fuck Coinbase like this my friends.
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:35:36
make them watch famous movie two girls one cup.
@_date: 2017-12-17 05:04:22
I´m sorry but your post is very stupid. The wallets service can be hosted (like Paypal). So there is no need for each user to open a payment channel. Only the service provider (Paypal) opens one payment channel to cover all users. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:48:51
not understand, my son didnt sell I sold.
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:20:46

sorry, trying to be funny
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:19:56
Yes, lets boycott my friend but also fuck them, fuck them hardcore. They will like. Fuck Coinbase motherfuckers.
@_date: 2017-12-03 06:19:21
I agree, its precious GOLD. I get this. we must HODL to the MOOn, to need to sale, so why move it. JUST HOLD IT 
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:14:50

@_date: 2017-12-20 04:49:54
yes, mother fuckers, why they pump Bcash, they need to pump bitcoin. I want to buy Golden Lambo
@_date: 2017-12-03 06:41:53
no you are a troll. Get ready for smaller blocks and more decentralization. People that run nodes decide what bitcoin should be.
Good, cuz I dont like soup.
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:50:25
yes, like famous movie, two girls one cup
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:37:55
smells very shity, like famous movie two girls one cup.
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:34:04
Golden Lambo
@_date: 2017-12-03 06:14:53
its ok, if you need to make fast payments you can use Litecoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:15:12
I understand, this is for old people joke. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:20:24
a double spent?
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:49:27
why you move, just HODL 
@_date: 2017-12-06 14:45:08

exactly, even fees at $1000 or $10000, you have the most secure network in the world
@_date: 2017-11-15 06:32:58
yes, small blocks. More security= more value to our gold. Luke says he wants to reduce them, I fully support them.
@_date: 2017-11-15 06:56:51
much better, we can do a user activated softfork with hats and everything.
@_date: 2017-11-13 21:00:48
you dont understand, you are moving GOLD on the most secure network of the world. It will have some cost.
@_date: 2017-11-15 06:16:43
HAHAHAHAHAHAH, but take this talk to other place please.
@_date: 2017-11-15 07:23:52
I think you are adopted.
@_date: 2017-11-12 10:18:01
my transaction is stuck for 3 days now, I did use very small fee. $5 USD
@_date: 2017-11-15 05:59:54
exactly, just take the shitcoin discussion somewhere else
@_date: 2017-11-15 07:20:04
they are slightly stupid.
@_date: 2017-11-15 06:02:16
because is GOLD, just keep it secure. Why use it? 
@_date: 2017-11-12 04:33:12
This one may backfire
@_date: 2017-11-15 07:24:43
trully stupid. Never mind congratulations, golden lambo Awaits. to the Moon.
@_date: 2017-11-15 05:12:16

@_date: 2017-11-15 05:45:24
user research team, you mean there is more than one person working on this?
@_date: 2017-11-15 06:47:52
no, more people running nodes.
@_date: 2017-11-15 06:59:23

@_date: 2017-11-13 19:52:12

People bitching about fees just dont understand the importance of security. Who cares if we have to pay $50 or $100 fees, we have the most secure network in the world.
@_date: 2017-11-15 07:04:27

@_date: 2017-11-15 07:04:08
because is good for security.
@_date: 2017-11-15 01:16:04
this is likelly long term, but keep in mind you are holding gold that will become more and more valuable. 1 or 2 years from now the Lighting Network will make payments fast and cheap.
@_date: 2017-11-15 05:32:47
why sell them bro, just HODL forever.
@_date: 2017-11-13 19:50:57
stop posting stupid stuff if you dont want to get it remove. You may end being banned at the end. JUST STOP NOW
@_date: 2017-11-15 05:13:06
remove BCH and you will get more support
@_date: 2017-11-15 05:44:20
how are things for LN; do you know how long will it take to be ready for everyone to use?
@_date: 2017-11-15 06:55:40
FUCK off to talk about scam coins somewhere else, no bitches here.
@_date: 2017-11-15 07:24:30

@_date: 2017-11-15 05:32:04

@_date: 2017-11-15 05:39:33
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:28:16
Shitcash dies now!! finally. Everyone knows Bitcoin is Gold, who cares if transactions are 10, 20 or even 100 dollars. You are using the most secure network in world to move money.
@_date: 2017-11-15 07:25:37
ok. that is f!"·!"· perfect. now I have to deal with international shit. I dont get paid enough.
@_date: 2017-11-15 06:26:22
that is stupid, who cares about fees when you have high levels of security.
@_date: 2017-11-15 06:13:31
MOOOOOOON!!!!! YES!!! BUY AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE ; BUT THE DIP , BUY THE TOP
@_date: 2017-11-15 06:14:09

@_date: 2017-11-15 05:33:46
hahaha is a dumbass, what a shithead
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:31:47
Coinbase is scared of Blockstream, they know they are about to lose their business. Give us our Bcash now .
@_date: 2017-11-15 07:01:02

To the MOOOOOON, HODL forever. Golden Lambos for everyone.
@_date: 2017-11-15 05:59:32

@_date: 2017-11-15 06:08:21
Why do you need an exchange, just F HODL.
@_date: 2017-11-12 10:25:56

@_date: 2017-11-13 19:50:16
then just F... wait, do you want something fast, or do you want GOLD.  You sound like B Bch
@_date: 2017-11-15 06:01:27
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHA, TO THE MOOOOOOOOOON, HODLLLLLLLLL, GOLDEN LAMBOS FOR EVERYONE
@_date: 2017-11-15 06:27:17
ok, now about your post. I think is obvious your idea is stupid
@_date: 2017-11-15 06:51:35
no, that is too small. Luke said 250kb.
@_date: 2017-11-15 07:19:15
but, you couldn't use it, fee is much higher. fee is 0.0001 then why have 0.00001 . This is wrong, something is wrong.
@_date: 2017-11-15 04:53:00
is for Bitcoin discussion, you can take your Shitcoin discussion elsewhere
@_date: 2017-11-15 07:01:28
maybe is good idea, just need to keep my gold secure from the HACKERS:
@_date: 2017-11-15 05:02:26
is simple, if you want to discuss Shitcoins, go to a shitcoin subreddit. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 06:36:50
OK; I GOT IT: YES; JUST HODL, dont transfer, dont move, just buy more. thank you.
@_date: 2017-11-15 04:44:14
Amazing read, Im sick of people BCHing about Fees. Who cares if fees are 50 or even 100 dollars. You have the most secure network in the world to transact with.
@_date: 2017-11-15 06:35:38
THE FEES TO TRANSFER ARE OVER $15 right now
@_date: 2017-11-11 01:04:49
good advice, thank you
@_date: 2017-11-10 03:47:50
correct, so bad people. Bitcoin the best Hold to the moon.
@_date: 2017-11-15 06:07:42
That is stupid, if we have a chance we should just destroy the little BCHs now.-
@_date: 2017-11-15 05:43:40
ok. sorry for your loss
@_date: 2017-11-15 06:54:17
hahahahahaha, MOOOOOOOOOOOn, HODDDDDDDDLD, everyone gets a GOLDEN LANBO. Then we take GOlden lambo and pick up some Bitches coins.
@_date: 2017-11-15 06:59:12
is a shitcoin, totally. please dont talk about shitcoins here.
@_date: 2017-11-15 06:39:06
because the idea is slightly retarded in first place.
@_date: 2017-11-15 06:54:53
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHHAHA, MOOOOOON; HODL; BUY TIP, BUY TOP, SELL EVERYTHING; BUY MORE. HAHAHAHAHAH
@_date: 2017-11-15 05:00:17
is about SECURITY, is GOLD, it needs to be secure and security is EXPENSIVE. A $30 USD fee is extremely cheap, I wouldn't mind paying 100 or even 200 dollars per transaction as I know my GOLD is secure. 
Now, you are obvious Shitcoin shill, go away.
@_date: 2017-11-15 05:03:57
Mining hashrate, Dash or Litecoin are even worst than Bitchcoin
@_date: 2017-11-10 03:15:37
the one that is the most efficient
@_date: 2017-11-13 19:48:14
haha stupid noobs bitches.
@_date: 2017-11-15 05:50:32
ehhh,seriously people need to do some reading before writing here
@_date: 2017-11-15 07:00:19
this is double stupid go away, far far.
@_date: 2017-11-10 03:17:23
is this the reason for BCASH to go up like this? Im worried.
@_date: 2017-11-15 06:10:37
Coinbase, buy as much as you can
@_date: 2017-11-15 06:21:45
what you mean?
@_date: 2017-11-13 02:33:30
does it work like LN, need a transaction to open a channel or something similar? How do you connect the 2 chains?
@_date: 2017-11-15 06:58:35
because you lose, just HODL, MOOON AND GOLDEN LAMBO FOR EVERYONE. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 00:29:53
Who pays the transaction fees?
@_date: 2017-11-15 06:08:01
What is this shit?
@_date: 2017-11-12 02:38:26
Please HOLD until January, its ok just hodl for 2 months and then we MOOON,, its ok my friend dont worry. JUST HODL and Please PUMP bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-15 07:26:27
that is fucking wonderful.
@_date: 2017-11-15 06:04:43
YES; BUY THE DIPS FOR DOUBLE GOLDEN LAMBO
@_date: 2017-11-15 04:41:21
What BCH competitiveness, what an A.... BCH is a shitcoin. You sound a lot like a shill
@_date: 2017-11-15 06:00:26
agree, down with BCH coin. GOLD FOREVER TO THE MOOOOON; HODLLL
@_date: 2017-11-13 04:31:32
but Core developers are Blockstream employees. Are we sure that is a good idea? What if it goes wrong. Wish we had multiple implementations like Ethereum
@_date: 2017-11-10 19:07:23
I do now, I sold all my Bitcoin for Bitcoin Cash, much faster.
@_date: 2017-11-12 10:16:19
careful you may get banned
@_date: 2017-11-15 05:42:19
no, im tired of people writing the same about Segwit. It will take some time.
@_date: 2017-11-12 10:26:47
It is, and know you will get banned. Just wait for Mods to be awake
@_date: 2017-11-12 10:19:15
VITALIK ASHOLE; WHY YOU DO THIS:
@_date: 2017-11-15 07:28:44
yes, very smart. You evil genius. Some one should just go ahead and give you that Golden Lambo.
@_date: 2017-11-13 19:51:36
you will be banned for this attitude, maybe a BCH too?
@_date: 2017-11-15 07:08:04
because fee is 0.001 , why we have 8 decimals 0.0000001 
no need.
@_date: 2017-11-15 07:21:36
that is so stupid, I'm having problems typing how stupid that is.
@_date: 2017-11-15 07:18:33
let me have my drinks a HODL; 
@_date: 2017-11-15 06:13:46
HAHHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH, YES, GOlden Lambos for everyone
@_date: 2017-11-15 06:07:14
is the Fees market, is part of security system. Is good for everyone
@_date: 2017-11-12 00:38:45
yes, we are a 1.8 years away for Lighting Network then just neeed to pay a transaction once to open a channel and one to close it. While open you can do lots of transactions for only minor fees.
@_date: 2017-11-05 05:16:37
But transaction fees are over 7 USD. Using fiat will make it a lot cheaper. Maybe it works if you buy A LOT of popcorn.
@_date: 2017-11-15 06:02:49
ITS OK, we MOOON SOOON, 20,000 each bitcoin but dont sell just HODL, to the MOOON, Golden Lambos for everyone
@_date: 2017-11-15 06:14:42
This is the most retarded post all I have read in my whole life
@_date: 2017-11-15 05:28:01
Sorry bro, but that is kinda retarded
@_date: 2017-11-15 07:02:24
Golden LAMBO AWAITS:
@_date: 2017-11-12 00:44:40
yes no pain, just TO THE MOON AND HOLD , please pump bitcoin now please Sir.
@_date: 2017-11-15 04:42:46
exactly, who cares if transactions get a bit expensive. You have the most secure network in the world to transact with. I wouldnt care paying 30 or 40 dollars fee, As I know how secure the transaction will be.
@_date: 2017-11-12 10:19:50
@_date: 2017-11-13 19:43:45
this is very stupid, anyone is free to talk their mind here.  You sound like Bcash shill.
@_date: 2018-02-24 19:31:24
are you aware of UASF?
@_date: 2018-02-12 19:40:05
no he did not.
@_date: 2018-02-20 23:44:27
so I have to trust the other party?  While this may not be a problem I like how on chain transactions are always trust-less. We can always use Litecoin or other ALTs to transfer value with low fees on chain.  
@_date: 2018-02-24 15:10:53
If Jihan dumps BTC and buys BCH we are fucked.
@_date: 2018-02-24 15:06:11
Why is there no mention of Jihan and Cobra discussion on @_date: 2018-02-12 04:48:01
I respectfully disagree, see bellow:
"I believe it'll be possible for a payment processing company to provide as a service the rapid distribution of transactions with good-enough checking in something like 10 seconds or less.
The network nodes only accept the first version of a transaction they receive to incorporate into the block they're trying to generate.  When you broadcast a transaction, if someone else broadcasts a double-spend at the same time, it's a race to propagate to the most nodes first.  If one has a slight head start, it'll geometrically spread through the network faster and get most of the nodes.
A rough back-of-the-envelope example:
1         0
4         1
16        4
64        16
80%      20%
So if a double-spend has to wait even a second, it has a huge disadvantage.
The payment processor has connections with many nodes.  When it gets a transaction, it blasts it out, and at the same time monitors the network for double-spends.  If it receives a double-spend on any of its many listening nodes, then it alerts that the transaction is bad.  A double-spent transaction wouldn't get very far without one of the listeners hearing it.  The double-spender would have to wait until the listening phase is over, but by then, the payment processor's broadcast has reached most nodes, or is so far ahead in propagating that the double-spender has no hope of grabbing a significant percentage of the remaining nodes."
@_date: 2018-02-14 02:07:30
same thing, like it or not Blockstream is Core, and they decide what Bitcoin is. They have my full trust. fuck Bcash.
@_date: 2018-02-20 23:38:23
a watcher service is called
@_date: 2018-02-20 18:19:42
@_date: 2018-02-21 02:27:59
can on chain transactions be hacked? We can just use an ALT to  on chain transactions and avoid these issues.
@_date: 2018-02-14 04:13:40
thank you.
@_date: 2018-03-14 00:06:31
How does LN work if I want to use my phone to send and receive payments?
@_date: 2018-02-14 01:02:08
Shapeshift is against Blockstream and Core, boycott it now. 
@_date: 2018-02-12 19:46:09
came to say same, things look ok now but a spike of transactions changes this. Why are only 14% of transactions Segwit? We should already be over 50% by now. Also why is LukeJr against segwit transactions?
@_date: 2018-02-20 18:19:37
@_date: 2018-02-24 15:08:05
Miners don’t have a say. It’s all about the nodes. So Fuck Jihan we can do what we want.
@_date: 2018-02-14 01:05:23
if not boycott Shapeshift and all Erik Voorhees projects.
@_date: 2018-02-20 18:19:49
@_date: 2018-02-20 21:21:29
so there is no need to be online 24 7?
@_date: 2018-03-13 04:04:50
I went to hypnosis, but now I remember I lost it all at the casino just before the session. Oh too bad. Also I feel the desire to move to another country far away from here and never come back or talk about the hypnotist. 
@_date: 2018-02-12 04:35:46
how is this the future? It actually the pass, we use to be able to do this with 0 confirmations and 0 fees! Plus we dint need to deal with channels, watchers, and such.
@_date: 2018-02-20 21:30:48
so this is when you need a watcher, so that payments can be received even if you are offline?
@_date: 2018-02-20 18:53:08


So, fees are a function of risk. Got it. 
Users that cant be online all the time need to also pay for Watcher service. How do we pay and how much will they cost?
@_date: 2018-02-20 18:19:15
wouldn't fees cost also be a function of risk? That is peoples nodes that provide liquidity risk loosing them to a hack.
Also is there a warranty that payment will take the shortest path?
@_date: 2018-02-21 01:19:54
Because it can be hacked?
@_date: 2018-02-26 23:45:14
Wouldn't fees be a function of security instead of a function of operating costs? If you are willing to provide liquidity and put your funds at a stake,you would want to charge fees that offset the risks, which by how things look now are very high. 
@_date: 2018-02-20 18:19:46
@_date: 2018-02-14 01:07:00
boycott Erik Voorhees and Shapeshift.
@_date: 2017-07-27 02:37:27
It is not decentralized if you need to ask for permission to list a token!
@_date: 2017-07-27 02:35:06
Do you work for it? I  will try it: As per Counterparty and OMNI, both have decentralized exchanges on production. USDt for instance runs on OMNI.
@_date: 2017-07-26 23:46:40
Decentralized Exchanges for the win, time to checkout OMNI Layer DEX and Counterpary, work on top of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-07-27 04:51:42
I'm sorry but if there is a central authority dictating rules, the it is not a decentralized solution and is not different from any other centralized exchange. 
@_date: 2017-07-27 03:05:56
do you need to ask permission to add an Altcoin? and if so, are you certain you can refer to it as decentralized?
@_date: 2017-07-27 01:44:33
Is it a different blockchain? I only trust Bitcoin.
