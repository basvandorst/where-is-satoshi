Why is it completely unsustainable? Because it feels pricey?

It won't go up the way it did on it's way to $265, but over time, as more people start using it, as it exchanges more hands more often, it's worth will grow. The world at large is still not ready for BTC.

Quick question. What is stopping them from using their funds to buy a lot of coins already? Whats to say, considering they are pro speculators and such that they hadn't invest a good fortune in it already, much before the price surge began?
Just questions I'd ask myself.

If you were looking to make some quick money, then sucks for you. But if you are just holding on to it for it's worth at some point in the future, you shouldn't be crying about it. Buy what you will use, or buy to save. Don't buy thinking that $250+ spike that happened is going to repeat. And no one ever said the bit coin prices are going to go up to $1000 in 1 year.
If you are crying, it's because of the misconception you dove in with. I whine about it, but I definitely don't cry because this was bound to happen. The prices should actually be around $50 something, maybe $60 something but definitely not where it was. Someone even showed it with a graph from some economic concept.
Remember, not everyone is a successful day trader. Not everyone makes billions in the share market. And there are always fool who have a distraught look with their hands holding their head every time a financial crisis happens. Don't be that guy. 
Invest wisely. And if you are investing in BTC, keep buying what you can afford and don't look at it's price compared to USD. Think of it as a  long term investment. Come back in 5 years, and we'll see if you are still crying.
Edit: God damnit, you weren't crying, you were just sad.

Some Jackie Chan of the hedge business might have caught the 1500 Btc at $36. What a killer trade.

I hate to admit I didn't get this joke on the original comment. The picture doesn't help make it any clearer. Anyone want to make me feel like noob and explain this?
@_date: 2013-04-21 16:46:49
Ah, that makes a lot of sense. So I guess the answer would be an exponential increase in computing capacity. Thanks for the reply.

Wasn't the Cyprus incident a part of the reason why that spike happened? There were so many things happening at the same time!!
These are indeed cheap bitcoin prices. Totally agree that I'd have scoffed at hearing the prices will be $10 when it was $2. I was just making that $50 prediction based on the 6 month chart available from Mt. Gox. Seemed reasonable at the time ..... no so much anymore.

I use coinbase. You buy the coin at the lastest market price or so I think. Once bought that's that. It comes to your account about 3-4-5 days once they have confirmed bank transactions.
I bought a few coins the other day at $48. Now it's down to $41 but I am still getting the same number of coins.
@_date: 2013-03-21 15:37:10
Jeezus guys, you are scaring me. I have some coins sitting in that site. I am not really worried about it, but from all the posts I've seen about coinbase, I am starting to think I should move it to a personal wallet.

Sell hard!!! Let us know before you do, so we can take advantage of the .30cent drop. (JUST KIDDING)
@_date: 2013-03-12 05:04:55
Isn't that the same idea for most available currency?
@_date: 2013-04-01 23:57:38
My bad. I didn't realize there were other similar posts.
@_date: 2013-04-14 18:14:19
Cute. I still got .5 btc at $212 as it was falling. I could care less but as a user rather than a hoarder of BTC I think this affected me a little more than most others who are saving to be billionaires in 5 years.
I guess what I really want to say is, people! start using it for transactions so the value rises because it is being used and not because speculator are creating a bubble by hoarding it.

Slightly off topic, but would upgrading the network infrastructure to the Google Fiber level mitigate the effects of DDoS? Because you know, the available bandwidth for visitors is so high that DDoS just becomes a huge spike in visitors to the site?
My idea of how the internet works is very rudimentary.
@_date: 2013-03-12 03:40:24
Yeah, that makes sense. I was using coinbase and I thought it takes my order based on their current estimated market value. I thought if i made purchase at 36.5 they'd still honor my transaction. Oh well.
@_date: 2013-03-22 05:44:30
Thanks. I think I will move them to my personal wallet as soon as I can.
@_date: 2013-07-04 14:37:04
I feel you. I've been there myself. I stopped talking to people about this altogether. Sorry if I came off as too harsh.
@_date: 2013-03-12 05:14:59
Lol. NOPE. No drop at all :p Although things are almost back to normal again.
@_date: 2013-03-21 17:22:18
Yeah, I agree. Any recommendations for what I can use? I tried to use Bitcoin wallet. I don't know if there's another name for it. I sent myself some btc to an address on that program. But I've never been able to fully sync with the network. I even left it on over night ... still have 29000 blocks remaining. Not a bad time to finally receive that 1 btc i sent as a test transfer a year ago.

If you think you can manage to hold on to them for a significant amount of time, you could make a very good profit. In the long run prices are going to rise far beyond what it is now. Or so I've read.
@_date: 2013-03-21 13:15:49
Why is everyone so concerned with bitcoin crashing? In the long run, the price is suppose to level out at almost $1000/BTC or so I've read.
Honestly I see no reason for this kind of thought. I've only benefited from these price surges. I buy btc for a price and voila 2 weeks later what ever I need costs a little less in BTC. If you are a small time user, I doubt these price surges does anything but help you. If you are an investor, and freaking out of this risk, maybe entrepreneurial work is not for you.
