So many people fail to realize this. More people having access to the world wide ledger means more people will value it. It doesn't matter if blocks are 100kb or 100GB. The average person is not going to run a full node, period. Satoshi even said so himself. So might as well let blocks be as big as the network can handle.
Now I do disagree with the idea of unlimited block sizes for the simple fact that I like the idea of a "sanity check". If the upper bounds of block size can facilitate exponential growth in accordance to natural laws, then that is plenty. We don't need unlimited block size restriction. I think it's good to have a sanity check to prevent a potential DoS attack vector.
@_date: 2015-12-30 20:48:47
The block size limit is not an anti-spam measure. The block size limit is what is known in the computer science world as a "sanity check". It was implemented to help prevent one vector of denial service attack to the Bitcoin network.
Who gets to define what spam is, anyway? Why should the core developers have the power of censorship and the power to dictate market behavior?
Do we want a system of money that is part of a free market or not? I thought that was the whole point of Bitcoin. Putting an arbitrary artificial cap that constrains transactions in a piss poor attempt of a crude anti-spam measure goes against everything the original purpose Bitcoin has stood for. Go create your own cryptocurrency with a low-capped block size and let Bitcoin grow.
@_date: 2015-12-31 00:10:08
Bingo. The only reason the cap remains at 1MB is for purely ideological reasons. And it's an ideology that goes against what Satoshi had in mind.
@_date: 2015-12-30 21:36:51
You say that you're neutral, but I don't think you realize you prefer one option over the other.


They're doing this to facilitate 1MB blocks. If you don't agree with what core has done here, then you are in favor of larger blocks.
@_date: 2015-12-30 21:20:09
I think you have it backwards. Bitcoin plummeting to $1 wouldn't end people's faith in the system. People losing faith in Bitcoin is what would bring it to $1.
Most likely this would be due to a far superior e-cash technology emerging and Bitcoin failing to adapt.
@_date: 2015-12-31 00:00:04
Right. What I'm saying is bitcoin would effectively be dead *before* it ever gets to $1.

Lesser is not subjective. You can literally quantify which chain has the greater hashing power and market value.
@_date: 2015-12-29 06:09:39
How many times do you have to repeat a lie before it becomes the truth? I forget the exact number.
@_date: 2015-12-31 05:08:35
The problem is someone willing to attack the Bitcoin network with extremely large blocks won't care if they lose money. Heck, it wouldn't even necessarily be the attacker's money being lost. Imagine a hacker or government gaining control of a large bitcoin mining pool and flooding the Bitcoin network with absurdly large blocks that the network cannot handle. If that pool manages to create the longest chain, the network has no choice but to accept the large blocks.
Now, hopefully under such an attack miners could point their hashing power away from the malicious pool, but that would require constant vigilance on the part of miners. Not practical.
I'm not sure what such a DoS attack would actually *accomplish*, but presumably at the very least it would temporarily destabilize faith in the protocol, and at worst, who knows. I'm not technical enough to know what attacking the network with huge blocks would accomplish, but I presume Satoshi put in the cap for good reason.

Great user interface! You know, why can't the devs do something useful and automatically enable that feature when the client detects you have sufficient RAM?
@_date: 2016-01-03 17:49:00
Bitcoin mining centralization has was always an inevitability, and that's by design. All you have to do is understand the fact that the mining reward is winner takes all, there's an abrupt reward halving schedule that weeds out weak actors, and the natural laws of market forces (particularly economies of scale), all equate to favoring centralized mining. The good news is that mining is probably as "centralized" now as it will ever be. There will likely always be 3 big pools, and 4 or 5 pools will control the super majority of hashing power. I guarantee this will continue to be a fact 20 years from now.
Still a better system of money than fiat.

It's an alright experience for long-term cold storage, but this experience fails for anyone wanting to make small everyday purchases. The way around that is to have multiple wallets, one with your large balance kept in long term cold storage, and another wallet with a small balance which you leave on the device instead of erasing. But that's still a bit of a kluge for the everyday person to have to do.
It's really difficult balancing security and ease of use. I can definitely understand erring on the side of security over usability when it comes to Bitcoin, but I feel there's still a lot to be desired when it comes to user experience.

I can't believe what I'm reading. Actually implementing what Luke put in there would doom Classic to failure. It was obviously a move on his part as a sort of protest and to declare his sentiments about the project. Trolling is a perfectly accurate account of what Luke did. To say otherwise is to either live in an alternate reality or to purposely spread malicious propaganda. Which camp do you fall in?

I would love to see one of the small blockers answer your question. But my guess is the best you'll get is "Lightning Network and SegWit will solve all this, big blocks lead to centralization so I'd rather limit Bitcoin so that at best only 1 million people in the entire world would be able to use Bitcoin rather than to have it become any more centralized than it already is, Mike Hearn and Gavin Andresen are evil people working for the CIA, and the Core developers know what they're doing so stop worrying".
@_date: 2016-01-18 19:30:11


Oh, I do. Bitcoin developers work for us, not for themselves, and so I say "fork them, I'm switching to Classic".

Ah, I see your angle now. Your assumption is that Bitcoin is being "propped up" and so today's price does not reflect reality. That sort of argument can be said of many markets, not just Bitcoin. The housing market is being propped up in my opinion. China's stock market is being propped up. It would sound wise to me to stay out of those markets for the foreseeable future, and yet they could still make great returns for the next 5 or 10 years before the bubble pops.
Bitcoin is still new, still being figured out, and still growing. Even if the only real use today is speculation about its future potential, that's still not a bad reason to own some bitcoin. I wouldn't go all in and trade on crazy leverage, but choose a risk tolerance and manage my portfolio accordingly.
You may be right, though, or I may end up being right. It's impossible to know for certain, as time will be the only proof. I chose to take the risk that I am comfortable with, and I do so because I feel the odds are in my favor based on the years of research and information I've gathered. But again, it's impossible to know for certain and I accept the possible downside risk. If only everyone else who invests in any kind of market took that approach.
I think you will find the majority of people to be quite irrational. It happens time and time again in all markets, some markets more frequently than others. I feel confident that Bitcoin will get its day once again.

Easy there, George Orwell. A fork of Bitcoin that creates blocks using alternate consensus rules is just that -- a fork. No need for the doublespeak.
The responsible way to do a hard fork is to ensure super majority approval. That way the inferior fork with low hashing power goes extinct very quickly. In that case it's naive to think the weaker alternate chain will last long or have any economic viability. Calling it an altcoin is completely disingenuous.
@_date: 2016-01-16 23:22:48
He's pro single client. The very same client that has been hijacked by newer developers who are small block idealists. He uses a lot of newspeak to defend his agenda, saying that alternate clients are "altcoins", and by bending the definition of the word "consensus". I don't know why he has this agenda, but that's what it is.

Look at you. Look at you purposely being deceptive. Twice you referred to him as "Mr. Toomim" knowing damn well there are two Toomim brothers. One of them is in charge of Classic. The other one is not. The one you refer to is the one who is **not** in charge.

Wat. Gresham's Law does not apply to Bitcoin at all. Please read up on it so that you understand what it actually is. And what a warped view it is to think that putting an artificial limit on velocity will help Bitcoin. That's no better than a federal reserve banker playing with interest rates. I much prefer a free market rather than a market imposed with artificial constraints. And that's just the thing. Since no single entity controls Bitcoin, the free market will choose the path it wants eventually, be it Bitcoin with bigger blocks or an alternative cryptocurrency with superior properties.
@_date: 2016-01-07 06:12:27
Of course not. Gox showed us that few people pay attention to the obvious warning signs. I saw the writing on the wall with Cryptsy over 18 months ago and responsibly withdrew all my money then and there, warned others to do the same, and why.
I'm not surprised in the least that people didn't listen and pay attention. It's amazing where people will put their money without first doing the research. But never surprising.
The sad thing is, humanity will never learn. History will repeat. There will be yet another Gox/Cryptsy/Paycoin/Moolah, there will be obvious warning signs that they should be avoided, but people will still get burned and stupidly throw away their money.

Great example of anti-fragility.
You know, I've never seen anyone mention this, but one of the benefits of having bigger blocks in Bitcoin is that bigger blocks weed out weak nodes with low bandwidth, and so those who want to continue to operate nodes must upgrade their hardware and bandwidth. I think it can safely be argued that having nodes with higher bandwidth benefits the network and its users more than having nodes that can only handle low bandwidth, even if in the latter scenario the node count is higher.
If we want *more people* to use Bitcoin, we will need more resources dedicated to facilitating that, period.

You're joking, right? The reason NASA exists at all as we know it is primarily because of the Cold War and the space race with Russia. Then once competition loosened up and NASA turned into a bloated bureaucracy, they gave us failures such as the Space Shuttle program. Yes, Space Shuttles were a failure. They were overly complex, expensive death machines that did not serve their dreamed up purpose of a reusable spacecraft very well. The project should have been scrapped right after the Challenger disaster, but it drudged on because we didn't invent a better way to get into space.
How do you know NASA does well without competition anyway? Imagine what advancements we may have today if there was still fierce competition. We may have landed humans on Mars 10 years ago for all you know.

@_date: 2016-01-22 20:32:06
The argument is less to do with whether or not the limit is artificial, but everything to do with if that artificial limit is being imposed on valid transactions and affecting them negatively. A significant number of blocks have been full lately. This affects legitimate, non spammy transactions in a negative way. A bump to 2MB, while still artificial, relieves this problem. Of course 2MB just kicks the can. Ideally the limit wouldn't be artificial at all and would closer reflect reality. But you're not going to get the miners and the community to accept anything but the most conservative approach at this time due to the contention. Maybe once people realize hard forks aren't so scary we can use a more ambitious approach such as BitPay's adaptive limit proposal.
Classic isn't The One^TM solution to end all solutions. It's competition. It's there to disrupt Core's dictatorship and put them in check. In the end, it's the good ideas that will win, no matter what side they come from.
@_date: 2016-01-13 21:44:03
Seriously. But to people's credit, it feel like Satoshi is being really vague even with full context.

And more importantly, he doesn't seem to have a problem with hard forks so long as there is sufficient warning in advance.

So money isn't just for humans!

The problem is, Segwit is not and should not be viewed as a scaling solution. Allowing more transactions is just a perk of Segwit.
Core devs are just needlessly fear mongering over a hard fork. They've been delaying it on purpose and using fear tactics to try to persuade the community. Maybe the reasons are ideological to the point of ridiculousness, or maybe their motives are less pure.

No they're not. And Core aren't the gatekeepers of all complex technical matters. People outside of Core can understand the issues. It's pretty clear to anyone who isn't a shill that Core has stalled raising the block size for ideological, political, and power struggle reasons, not technical ones.

To be fair, most people new to the internet in the late '90s had the same sort of question regarding email. A lot of people (myself included!) thought you would have to have your email program open in order to receive email from someone, or else you'd miss it when someone tried to send you one. Part of the reason for this has to do with not understanding technically what is happening behind the scenes, but mainly it's just never having ever used the technology before and having no idea what to expect, so you just make assumptions. Once you actually start using it you begin realizing how it works without knowing what goes on technically in the background.
I actually think this is a good question to ask, especially with Bitcoin, because bitcoin is money. It shows a sense of caution. However I agree that people ought to have this question answered right as they're deciding which wallet to use. Definitely something to add to a prominent FAQ. And it really should be spelled out before downloading that Core is for more advanced users with more in-depth needs. And let's face it, Core and its cousins are anything but user friendly even for moderately advanced users. Most of the features are only accessible through command line. It just goes to show you how much Bitcoin is still a work in progress.
@_date: 2016-01-08 22:14:52
Because we're invested in Bitcoin right now, it's still not too late to change things, and it's actually easier to work with what we have than to start new when you consider all the infrastructure built around Bitcoin. However should we reach a point where Bitcoin transactions cease to go smoothly and fees reach a point that the market will not bear, then that is where there is no going back and people do jump ship en masse.

@_date: 2016-01-13 07:46:43
You're making the assumption that value cannot appreciate or even be created seemingly out of nothing. Bitcoin is not a zero sum game. There is actual value in the protocol, and to own bitcoin is to own a piece of that. And I would argue that buying bitcoin and holding it for 5 years and selling it for, say, 10x what you bought it for, is not free money. You exchanged one form of value for another and tied it up for a long period of time, speculating that the value would appreciate. You could very much have been wrong and lost most if not everything. Risk is not free.
@_date: 2016-01-09 07:50:20
Would you care to provide some proof of this claim?
@_date: 2016-01-04 18:54:22
I'm really not understanding what you're trying to get at with all your questions. Yes, I trust 4-5 enormous mining operations more than I trust one centralized bank. The miners get paid for securing the blockchain, they are heavily invested in the Bitcoin ecosystem, and they are incentivized to work in their own best interest and in the best interest of the protocol. Yes, they could try colluding with other miners that would do something that is against bitcoin's interest, but not only does that require trusting another party, but it also compromises the faith and trust in Bitcoin itself, which in turn devalues the very thing they are heavily invested in. Bottom line is, miners would rather see Bitcoin do well than to try and destroy it. It's just more profitable that way.
Fiat money is easier to use for the majority of transactions? Ok, then use fiat. But as online markets like OpenBazaar become more prevalent, using fiat won't even be an option. The future of money is digital and online. Bitcoin fits that bill just fine. And there's more to money than just "ease of transactions". I like the deflationary, gold-like property of bitcoin.
As to your last question, more people see the value in Bitcoin and so they start using it. Are you saying you don't think miners will raise the block size limit to accommodate more users and to rake in more fees? Miners are not going to work against their livelihood. If they can make more money by raising the block size, then they will raise it.

Core's leadership has proven itself inept. They've waited far too long and brought this contention and toxicity on themselves. Bitcoin deserves better leadership. I don't know if Classic's leadership will prove superior, but it's worth trying when you *know* that Core's leadership is abysmal. At the very least, maybe taking power away from Core will put those developers in check and they'll actually consider their customers' wishes going forward.
