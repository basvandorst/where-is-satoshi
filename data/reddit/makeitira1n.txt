I guess we might as well ban the USD since it's used for:
Purchasing Illegal Goods
Drug Trafficking
and money Laundering
But I guess I am making too much sense

I'm a bit paranoid as you could tell &gt;.&lt;, I honestly wouldn't have sued unless something happened, but I suppose I am overreacting a bit.
Also I'm not gonna get worked up over .3 BTC (although getting it back would be nice :D) But I am more worried about my SSN and documentation I provided the company.

Bitcoin is considered a currency, because of the fact that it is a different system of money.

I don't think that BTC addresses need to "Go" but having a DNS-like service for bitcoin addresses wouldn't be a bad idea.

I agree with that statement.
Tbh I am still pretty young and haven't invested into stock/bonds yet.  I personally thing that crypto currencies have a high potential of going up in value as oppsosed to a stock, but diversifying wouldn't hurt, esp since I don't have any investing exp.
Also I plan on cashing a bond for $100 into litecoin for now.  It's an amount I can afford to lose

Cold Storing on a blockchain account is a better idea than storing on an exchange. Especially since blockchain gives you your private key and they don't know the key themselves.
I would still prefer traditional cold storage/paper wallets to be as safe as possible, and use blockchain for funds you would plan on spending

I understand your frustration towards these people who kidnap these girls, but "buying" back their freedom will only encourage these kidnappers to keep doing what they're doing. You might free a girl today, but that will only put another girl at risk tomorrow.
You have the right goal, we just need to use a different approach that will stop this trend **forever**

...The whole purpose of bitcoin is to be un-american... in fact no government controls bitcoin.
