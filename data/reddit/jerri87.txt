'Interesting' - another way to say 'unprofitable'
The fact is that they DON'T have anywhere near adequent margins for that kind of spending, and the underlying idea is completely foolish and misguided.
Who would want to go into a physical bank/helpdesk to buy Bitcoin?
Its intimidating to go into such places, especially if you have no idea about what youre buying. Why would anyone go in there in the first place? Because they saw an ad on the football game channel? People have to know why theyre buying before they express any kind of interest in buying.
Anybody who does have an idea of Bitcoin would just buy it online and learn for themselves how to use it.
Plus keep in mind that Cyprus is a tiny country with an adult population of less than 1 million. Even if they attracted 1% of the adult population somehow, and could get $1000 in fees out of each of those people over 5 years, that would only be $2 million/year
Now consider how much they have to spend on buildings, advertising, ongoing services, salaries and taxes. Even with those wildly optimistic figures, they'd barely break even!

Historical support on the chart during the price rise, not market spread

I'm an Australian living in Sydney and I've never heard of 'Forsythe Real Estate'.
As for paying for all basic living expenses with Bitcoin, what a crock!
Hey guess what, I can do the same thing you describe of selling X and buying gifts cards with X being  Runescape gold and TF2 hats - it doesn't mean I can actually use Runescape Gold and TF2 hats as currency, and the same with Bitcoin.
Here's whats really been going on in Australia recently: 
The ATO is going to treat Bitcoin as a good subject to barter and GST rules and subsequently tax 10% GST on Bitcoin both when you barter it and when you sell it for cash. 
So say you buy a burger for 0.01BTC - The Bitcoin is accounted for in terms of bartering credits (as with any other good), and is converted to a dollar value. Say this value is $5. An extra 10% is paid in GST, making it $5.50 total. But then a FURTHER 10% GST had to be paid if the BTC is converted to dollars, making it 20% tax total.
Also note that under Australian law in taxation matters, you are treated as guilty until proven innocent and not the other way around. So if large sums of money start popping up in your accounts, and you can't explain it, then you have to provide the receipts and information to prove your innocence or face tax evasion charges.
This has killed the prospect of accepting Bitcoin for the few small precious metals businesses I know of who have been considering it (their own words, not mine).
Apart from one pub or something, nobody here uses or cares about Bitcoin - except for the kind of people here who foolishly thought they could make a quick but out of it.

Been making these 'troll posts' since the price was at $1200. Was $1200 a good time to buy?
