That's funny, because the guy behind him appears to be dying.

Tell her this:
If the price is doubled in 6 months, you still think I should sell now?

I wouldn't be so hasty. There is still time for him to switch.

The fuck, I was just about to suggest you had to step up and do this verification proper. As always, you are two steps ahead of me
@_date: 2016-05-02 19:31:57
It seems you are right, except he also said


Anyway, at least my reasoning doesn't stand out as a childish rage quit, you have to give me that.
I guess I haven't kept up with the infantile race to the bottom surrounding bitcoin.

This raises the question why Gavin &amp; Co. didn't find Dorian Nakamoto satisfactory.
@_date: 2016-05-02 15:44:25


I think it would be because the fact that for Gavin to claim that Wright is Satoshi is so controversial that it could be a sign that Gavins account has been hacked.
Personally I don't see why Gavin can't say whatever he wants. Has nothing to do with hes credibility as a developer.

Did someone test the same key, signature and block using the method Craig Wright failed to use?
@_date: 2016-05-08 21:42:27
That's about right. It appears he was looking for a drop-in replacement for the existing economic system. Bitcoin is not that.
Apart from that I pretty much agreed with him. Too bad he didn't manage to boot the troika.

That's a good one, here is another:
Craig is under pressure from government to prove he is not Satoshi.
@_date: 2016-05-29 13:47:58
Same here. I believe those who doesn't have kids, doesn't live the square life and those working in technology are the typical exceptions here.
@_date: 2016-05-06 16:58:12
I really don't get all this outage. People behave as if Craig Wright is a fraud, but there is no proof of that. There is absolutely no reason to believe he is not Satoshi. The very same people also loudly claim that we are all Satoshi. If that is the case, so is Craig Wright.
I see no reason to put away the popcorn yet.
@_date: 2016-05-02 15:36:24
I disagree. Gavin has been wrong before, who cares.
The question is, will the value of bitcoin plummet if someone can claim the copyright to the protocol ?
@_date: 2016-05-02 16:01:29
Think about it.
The funny thing is that you have no legal right to abandon your copyrights.


With the banking cartel backing him up, nothing is impossible, legally

He doesn't debunk bitcoin as a global currency. He explains why bitcoin didn't work as an alternative route for Greece in the midst of their crisis. 
He really doesn't appear to understand bitcoin, and there is nothing in that talk indicating that he is able to free himself from the old way of thinking. After all he is an old school economist.
