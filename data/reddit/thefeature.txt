Thanks! I am kind of naive to it all, but even still I trust bitcoin more than any other form of investment or currency.

Thanks!

Can't it serve a dual purpose, especially in the early stages while it is behaving like one? 
@_date: 2015-05-10 17:14:25
what horseshit.

I hate that I keep missing this.

@_date: 2015-04-26 01:57:22
I missed out.

So if they refuse to go to the North Pole is it off to the Gulags or a concentration camp?

I need to spend more time on the new tab.

Stefan did a video debunking the resource based economy.

Thanks. I am looking at maybe getting a miner box. I dont pay for my power right now and have gift money put up, so I wont really be making a huge investment initially.

Computers do what they are told. Unless my mac book is self aware and I am not aware.

Geez, you sound like my republican uncle trying to convince me the NSA is a good thing because only bad people like privacy. 
@_date: 2013-12-06 21:31:34
This was very helpful. thanks! 
@_date: 2013-11-18 15:14:50
How about those miners on butterfly labs? 
@_date: 2013-12-06 21:32:08
Great. I will look into it.  Thanks

Ok, you and I have different definitions of anarchy or you are a statist troll. 
@_date: 2013-11-26 17:33:31
My main concern is intrinsic value and I think that this would make bitcoin or a similar digital currency more than just a fiat currency, but for now, I am pleased with how it's going. 
@_date: 2013-11-18 14:25:16
Say the prices doesn't come down for awhile, that's a huge investment. 
@_date: 2013-11-20 16:07:04
Get out of here with that statist nonsense, I dont need a reason for what I do to remain private. 
@_date: 2013-11-18 15:22:10
I just realized that. Fuck did I miss the bus on this. 
@_date: 2013-12-06 21:20:18
Thank you, I had no idea that sub existed. Ill be headed there. 
@_date: 2013-11-20 20:31:51
So because I don't think it's anyone's business what I do in private, I am using feelings of insecurity to make my decisions and because you want everyone's business out in open forum you are the an anarchist. 
Ok. 
@_date: 2013-12-06 21:19:53
Would mining any of them and then exchanging them for bitcoins be beneficial? 
@_date: 2013-11-20 21:56:51
I don't need a reason.
