I know it's not Bitcoin (although you can pay with Bitcoin), but it has many of the same goals and could do with a bit more exposure.
Of course Bitcoin would be a perfect partner for this, and if it gets funded, I'll be making sure there is a good Bitcoin wallet available.

I'm loving what Purism are doing with privacy/security, so if I were to pay for a VPN, I'd use their librem.one service:

Right, I just found out the easiest way to set a reasonable fee: disable dynamic fees in the preferences, and then you can set the fee at preset amounts like 30,50,70,100 sat/byte, which is still not the most flexible, but atleast you can get approximately the fee you want.

And, now Electrum is at 296 sat/byte for 25 blocks, which that site says is almost guaranteed to get into the next block at that price.
It also doesn't help that Electrum's user interface makes it rather difficult to override that fee too.

Yes, it's working fine. The transaction I just made included moving the rest of my funds to a new segwit wallet. Running on Ubuntu.

To be fair, I'm trying to make a transaction in Electrum right now, and setting the fee to lowest value (within 25 blocks), it's giving me a fee of 220 sat/byte, which for my transaction would actually be around $20.
This is obviously an issue with Electrum's crappy fee estimation, as  shows that 50 sat/byte would be plenty to get into the next couple of blocks, and within 25 blocks is estimated at about 30 sat/byte, which is 15% of what Electrum estimates it to be.

I use unique disposable addresses for everything, and this address was registered at the URL:  and never used anywhere else. Not sure if that domain was linked to localbitcoins.com or not.

Will the app be open source, and will there be API documentation? If this is open, I would be interested in adding support for this payment method into our wallet app directly.

I'm not advocating for or against RBF, but I wonder if this might dispell the myth of 0-conf security.
Consider when Bitcoin becomes more popular, there will surely be more greedy miners that will always accept the highest fee tx, even if it is not marked as RBF.
It seems that people believe this is not a problem if the majority of miners follow the rules. But, even if it's just 10% of miners accepting this, this means 10% of attacks will succeed.
As an attacker, I would simply attempt to double-spend all of my txs. This would essentially mean that I get 10% of my purchases back; it would be like having a credit card with 10% cashback, only the merchants are suffering because of it.
Because only a small percentage of people would be doing this, we can expect the merchants would see 1% or less of transactions as fraudulent, which I suspect would end up being about the same as credit card fraud.
So, perhaps RBF will simply highlight and break the illusion of 0-conf security. I think we can be better than credit cards, and should be aiming for 0% fraud. The only solutions I've seen so far are wait for a confirmation or create a lightning network type thing.
