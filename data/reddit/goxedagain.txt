too late for that.

Just got denied  GMT after using my IP address as evidence. Resubmitted with an estimate of my balance, and a list of some of the temporary addresses I submitted BTC to from my bitcoin client's address book.

I have to admit that the most surprising thing about this whole fiasco to me has been the Mt Gox bootlickers showing up in the forums to defend each delay as if we the customers whose money is completely locked down are the ones being unreasonable. What in the world makes you think they'll be able to get it "all worked out" after ANY amount of delay? They're not delaying to get it "all worked out", they're delaying because *they don't know what the hell they're doing*.
We're literally talking about the return of a financial exchange site being delayed because customer balances are failing to add up correctly and they don't even know why.
Are you really too stupid to realize how incompetent they are, or just so inherently submissive a personality that you'd defend them no matter what?

From the announcement:


Um, this would seem to suggest that some of the older accounts with unsalted password hashes were compromised and that their balances were modified by SQL injections, as previously hypothesized.

Hours ago? People were already stating this was likely in the immediate aftermath of the crash due to the unlikelihood of anyone actually being stupid enough to keep 500000BTC in their mtgox account. Based on what's come out since, it turns out not only was someone(s) stupid enough to do that (why keep more in your exchange account than you could possibly sell without bottoming out the market when you could just transfer coins in as needed?), but their account was old enough to have an unsalted password hash (salts were added later and old accounts didn't have them) AND had a password short enough and simple enough to be bruteforced.
Despite the fact that there really was such an incredibly stupid account holder, the original theory of the existence of a balance modifying SQL injection can't be ruled out in light of the issue that has led to the most recent delay.
