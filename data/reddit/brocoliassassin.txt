Theres a ton of supplements and nutrition to take before during and after use. Plus 150mg of pure MDMA is way different than the crap you get online and even off the streets. 
Every medication is going to have side effects.

MDMA and other psychedelics can cause permanent changes in people. Not all of them are temporary boosts. The severe comedown is due to poeple not supplementing MDMA properly, there is alot you can do to prevent alot if not all of the comedown.
That is what MDMA/Psychedelics can do, is they dont fix your problems but they can offer you new perspectives on how to look at your life and go on about changing it. 
Better living situations and jobs are not a permanent solution to cure depression, in reality nothing is. Believe it or not there are a ton of people with depression that have a job and great living situation. 
These aren’t always about permanent cures, its meant to help people. I’d rather take LSD once a year for my depression than to to be on SSRI’s daily.

I’ve seen exchanges close accounts that SENT to btc addresses dealing with nootropics/drugs/illegal stuff. 
And then for cash out time maybe some people got hit for their btc being traced to their activities.

What about those companies that want to put a tag on "dirty" bitcoins? So if you tried cashing them out they would come up as something used in a previous drug buy or something like that? If that were to ever go through would that destroy a good amount of BTC as well?
@_date: 2018-01-13 17:01:56
If they are already a huge corporation they would of just funded the entire thing by now. I highly doubt they somehow were waiting for years that bitcoin would be a thing and then that would be their money maker to donate. 
Imagine someone out there has something called empathy and doesn’t believe all the bullshit lies on the “war on drugs”. That many of these “illegal” drugs can actually be extremely beneficial to society.
But hey, keep downing that caffeine, alcohol,tobacco, mind-altering meds and were all good....

In the eyes of coinbase they are all the same .

I'm with you 100% on stagnation. I think that is one of the reasons I no longer am getting better, among a few other reasons as well. 
However through research we are seeing Mushrooms can get people to quit ciggarettes for good, LSD can get alcoholics to stop drinking, and in loads of cases psychedelics do help people long term. I've seen it with my own eyes help people. Sometimes it does it in a fun way sometimes it does it in a very heartbreaking disturbing way, or something nothing changes. 
But it's just another medicine to use in order to help people. And compared to the harm our legal meds due, psychedelics are still one of the safest options out there. 
Plus we live in a culture that I think is extremely anti-psychedelic, where its pushed to be a non-stop worker or else your useless to this society, we praise sociopaths, we still love wars, bail out bankers, destroy nature..
I think some of us are depressed cause we are in a society thats ruled by other types of drug users. Imagine if tommorow Caffeine, Alcohol,Tabacco and Benzo's were Schedule 1, no medical use at all. 
How many people would turn into "hardcore drug junkies?". 
That morning coffee to get you through the day ? Gone?? Hey how are  your weekends going to be or your parties, social gatherings with out that taste of alcohol.. No more smoking cig's to take the edge off of things and boy ..if you get caught with any of those... consider your chances of finding a good job out the window.. We may raid your house, take whatever we find , good luck paying your lawyers in court in fighting all this. 
Any type of recreational use is now considered an addiction.
To me it's just sad to see. Lets find study psychedelics, lets find the dangers, see what we can do minimize the risk of stuff getting out of control for some people, lets learn more about them. 
Our bodies are made of chemicals, we ingest all types of food and drinks that are mind altering, it doesn't meant its a bad thing.

Hah I still get this now! The big thing I hear now is it doesn’t matter if bitcoin goes to the moon, you can’t cash them out into dollars! No matter how much I explain that you can cash out BTC people just ignore more.. I know I’m the “Depressed crazy guy” but I just can’t believe that people just don’t want to believe.
I had another friend saying how he doesnt care he lost over 200+ bitcoins cause BTC supports pedophiles,rapists,drug dealers and he’s glad he’s not part of it.. I was going to chime into what he thinks about the dollar being so clean and no criminals using fiat for crimes up until another friend wrote in and saying bitcoin will only be used to pay mcdonalds employees in a few years since it that is what it was going to be aimed for..
SO yeah..i tapped out.I’m glad I didnt get myself into any more facebook arguments..

I'm praying to all the meme lords there are to reach 1,000,000 by summer.

I think for people not in the know for bitcoin it just comes off as a bunch of blocks that draws the viewer away from it.
It comes off as rather hiding bitcoin instead of bringing it to the forefront. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 01:22:59
I honestly think it would. I’ve been a manic depressive my whole life, hard to hold down any type of job, so I’m mainly bored all the time. 
The few good things I’ve done is invest in bitcoin when people told me it was a ponzi scheme(this was coming from an Amway salesman friend). 
Whenever I am happy I never go on the net or chekc fb,insta,etc..
If bitcoin hits 1million or near, I’ll have enough to travel wherever I want,live basically anywhere I want. Only problem is having no friends or joy in life to pursue anything. Almost makes BTC meaningless except for the fact I know my entire family would be set and maybe I could do some good with the money. 
GOod thing I at least know who to stay away from, since I’ve seen so many people especially women reduce your worth to your monetary or even as dumb as what car you drive...

Thats great to see you gave to all these places especially surprised to see MAPS!!! That's awesome!

Sorry that was my fault.. every time i put my money into btc it seems to dip all the time.. :( but im sure by next week the price will be back up again .
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:46:04
if bitcoin reaches 1 million btc im about to hop on one of those space flights that Virgin wants to do. It won't be holding to the moon, but it will still be closer than anyone else on earth. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:05:03
wait, so do you still have the wallet and your saying the wrong password is just for sending out the bitcoins??? If so , if you know its an 18 digit code, can't you just keep trying a brute force technique to see if anything works?? 
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:16:47
Well you can always start now...never know you may get lucky!!! :)
Or just hold on like technotrader said..never know what the future may bring and you may be able to get your fortune back.

aww is that why my meme isn't showing up?? I thought it was decent.. :(
@_date: 2017-12-13 15:22:00
TOR, MAPS, Wikipedia, Wikileaks, Drug Policy Alliance, The Water Project are just a few places that would be nice to donate to :)

If it does get to a certain price and I aquire my riches I”d have gone from a “loser” to a “somebody”. Maybe its just the city area I live by no one really listens to anyone who doesn’t have money.
I really can’t wait to disconnect somewhere nice for a long time and travel.. No more facebook, no more god aweful cringey instagram comedians, not caring whats no the news. 
Just enough money to say fuck you  and live the life I want.

Exactly my thoughts. If she’s garbage enough to not care about her kid and grab that easy money, once that easy money runs out she will def be back to cash grab along with a sob story to go with it. 
If you allow shitty people to dictate the terms of everything and you follow suite, don’t be surprised when they do it again.
On the plus side at least the kid gets to stay with a great father.
