They why say anything at all?
@_date: 2017-12-09 02:19:02
I have heard that you only pay taxes when money hits your bank account not on the exchange. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 04:41:02
Futures was the impetus. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 23:39:49
I was kidding. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:50:05
Is it possible for it to just go to zero? From what I have seen, the exchanges stop trading and people have time to think and calm down and not panic sell or get their money out. In that case only the dormant coins are fucked which is a good thing. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:18:37
Protecting customers is government overreach? THAT IS THE FUCKING POINT OF GOVERNMENT. To protect the people. Why have any law that keeps corporation from fucking over people?
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:46:48


@_date: 2017-12-12 19:55:17
Ye, LTC is a beast while BTC falters. Futures was a mistake.
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:24:58
The dude is doing something good. How is that so hard to believe? So many people became rich off Bitcoin, is it so hard to believe at least one person wants to give back?
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:59:00
How is it good for other people other than poor people? They still have to pay. I guess the poor doesnt matter.
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:04:34
It is suppose to be frictionless, secure and in your own control.
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:38:11
And if you cash out two weeks later you make more money and so on and so on. Why not wait till you are on your deathbed to sell. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:25:30
I would come back in at 200 but looking at the chart it does not look so. We will see. I am content too but knowing you could have had 3-4 times the amount is heart breaking.
@_date: 2017-12-18 15:54:52
No you could send 100000 and still pay 15
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:31:15
That didnt last long and LTC keep son trucking.
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:44:46
How do you see the walls? Depth chart? How to read it?
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:24:27
Nothing changes really. You can try buying everything with btc or sell on Bitcoin locals but any big deposit , the bank will report it anyway. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 15:01:09
Proof? You have none. You are like a republican voter who votes against their own interest because they are voting for a republican. I am done here. You are not listening and your argument is trust the companies they would chose people over thiir own profits. This is the same as the tax bill, take money from the poor and middle class to give to the rich in hopes they piss some money back our way from above.     
I am done here. Just watch this. This idiot Ajit Pi who is a Verizon shill wants to get rid of NN which benefits Verizon. Getting rid of NN is wildly unpopular across america but you and the corporations know best. You remind of the Trump voters who realize after the fact that he could give to shits about the miners, poor people, people of color, or anyone at all and now regret it.

@_date: 2017-12-12 17:42:38
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:49:42
SO how is this good? Why would they speed up bitcoin mining and transactions?    
Right now they should not be throttling anyway so why would it speed it up now?
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:51:46
It is fear, me included. People are scared.
@_date: 2017-12-13 03:00:46
Wouldnt ln solve some of those issues?
@_date: 2017-12-15 16:36:22
Goodluck with breaking the law then. You can use that defense when you are talking to a judge.
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:04:38
So when you sold it, it went directly to your bank account or your coinbase USD account?
@_date: 2017-12-18 15:45:55
But to almost quadruple? That is insane. People were afraid of futures and parked thier money on LTC. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:31:45
Nope, back down.
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:54:18
Normally taking the short position makes more money right?
@_date: 2017-12-14 00:21:15
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:23:54
Damn, wished I knew you back then and we both could have invested. Congrats on your new fortunes and bless your heart for giving back. If I was in your position I would do the same but I just invest a tiny amount mid year.     
Good luck. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:56:34
Okay, it was exactly as I thought. I watched this -    
So basically if it sits in an exchange it is not "Realized Earning" Realized earnings is when money is in an account that can be spent such as your checking/saving or a debit card. Makes sense.
@_date: 2017-12-17 22:52:21
I knew you were trolling me someone can't be that dumb. Good stuff man. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 22:18:18
Because the is no traffic  so lower fees. You can send a dollar, I never said you can't.
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:45:17
Not for people for their competitors then it trickles down to the people. Like netflix, they had to up their price because they wanted more.    
What about startup, they will kill competition so they set the price.
@_date: 2017-12-09 00:35:01
So everyone is expecting btc to drop just before sunday?
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:21:22
If it is depressing you so much and you are coveting other people's fortunes then get out of bitcoin and enjoy your life.     
You are only depress because you are not rich, cry me a fucking river.     
Make a choice, is your sanity more important than the chance of getting rich? I bet you will be here looking at reddit threads in the next minute anyway. You are not serious about it affecting your enjoyment in life. You wrote this because you are hoping someone give you 20 btc and feel sorry for you, that is why your left your address.
You just want to be rich, that is all.
@_date: 2017-12-09 03:45:08

Futures is going to cause a dip?
@_date: 2017-12-12 19:32:32
I lost a lot of money trading and I suck at it. So depressing. I just want to get out. Atleast I would have peace of mind instead of staring at a chart.

Fees will get you. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 22:09:08
No one is ordering a company to lower the price. Net neutrality is stoping a company from throttling data to websites they hate or the competions website.
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:32:29
Ye, I was thinking the same thing. Timing is everything. Goodluck
@_date: 2017-12-13 22:00:30
I think the ideal I believe is to do multiple transactions not just one one. LN is not meant to solves all high fee issues but help take pressure off the blockchain.      
Did you watch this? -
@_date: 2017-12-14 20:53:24
Netflix was not as popular and the internet providers were not getting into being a media conglomerate just yet. Now that they are, netflix is the competition.     
Did you say LTE and satellite? Are you kidding?&gt; There is no way LTE or Satellite is faster than traditional internet or cheaper or more reliable.
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:09:02
I was too but I have no heard one thing about it happening at all. Or even to any other hard wallet. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 04:02:49

No I am not. I have no clue. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:39:47
I have a question about taxes. When do you pay them?   
If I sell LTC and reinvest it in BTC do I pay taxes? The money never left the exchange.    
Or it is when I sell LTC and send the money to my bank account then I pay taxes?
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:51:20
I laughed at all the idiots making farms and spending a shit ton of money on it. I remember a guy used his swimming pool to cool down his crypto farm.

@_date: 2017-12-08 18:54:16
No one knows where the top is. That is why I don't feel so bad that I didn't buy back then because I probably would have sold long time. no way I would have kept it till now.

The baker analogy is bad because in lot of areas of america we only have Comcast available that is viable.

How will this affect BTC?
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:00:53
I never got this mentality. Everyone should have a reason to sell Bitcoin. You expect people to hold until they are 90? Then enjoy what?    
If you have a reason to sell then sell, why wait 10 20 years to sell then can't enjoy it?   
Would rather enjoy my life than just watching a number go up.

So how do people day trade? If you day trade then that means short term gains and about 40% tax rate. How would it be worth it?     
Hopefully someone can be of more help. Thanks for the reply tho. I might make a thread on it.
@_date: 2017-12-12 22:45:02
Look at my post history. Every decision I make is the wrong decision. I feel the crypto gods is against me. If i hold, BTC was crash or stay the same, if I sell, BTC will moon. There is no winning for me.

@_date: 2017-12-09 17:41:49
Don't worry I sold all my LTC the day before it mooned after holding for over 6 months then to buy into btc after it moons and now it crashes.     
They are always people worst off. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 05:00:44
Good. Think of it like if comcast owns raods in america. They can slow you down or stop you from take a road that goes to a bakery because there is already another bakery they own.     
You have no clue what you are talking about and you are talking about Government overreach but this bill is HELLA unpopular by the PUBLIC. this is not just the government trying to make regulations for anything.

@_date: 2017-12-14 16:48:12
I seem harsh on you because I feel the same way and with saying that to you I am saying that to myself. I want to get out of this bitcoin thing. My belly is in a knot all day.     
I knew of Bitcoin since 2010 and I did nothing. I laughed at all the bitcoin farmers who spent tons of money on thier servers. I was pissed off more at the miners for the price of graphic cards going up.      
I wished I even tried to mined back then but I didn't.        
I bought in LTC 6 months ago kept it right until the day before it mooned and bought into BTC which cratered after I bought. I feel sick and I have not been happy for the last week and a half.     
It will pass but it sucks. I do feel for you cause I feel the same way but people who had forethought to buy in should be able to give back to charity or be happy of their fortunes on reddit. There are always worst off people.       
Someday I do feel like selling everything and getting out, my productivity and how my day goes depends on if BTC goes up or down. I watch charts all day, BTC goes up then back right down by the end of the day. What a waste of time on my part. I think I am going to just store every off the exchange and exit this reddit and stop checking charts.
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:42:11
Ye it seems so. Altcoins are going to be pumped hard because BTC is staying stagnant.

What about the poor who can't pay? Fuck them right? Poor people don't matter. The internet was a way for the playing field to be level. You were born middle class or whatever so who cares about anyone else.     
Plus even if you want to brand this as government overreach. But this protects you. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:01:08
If that is your thinking then you will never cash out. everyone has their own point to cash out. Waiting till your are 90 to cash out makes no sense. Cash out when it hist the right number for your like not to see a number go up.
@_date: 2017-12-14 23:06:10
 A classic example, if Comcast sides with bitch ass Republicans which they do they can throttle internet so going to democratic websites are terrible to use.    
They can stop people from coming together online if it someone goes against something they did not like.

@_date: 2017-12-15 04:58:31
You have no clue what NN is. NN says that isp have to treat all internet equally no matter what. If Comcast owns Huffpost and NYtimes is the competitor, they can slow down NYtimes website so people would get their news from other places.      
Comcast can create a Netflix competitor and guess what they will do, slow down Netflix to be unwatchable so you will have little choice so you will go to Comcast Media.    
You are voting against yourself to support corporation that give two shits about you. Comcast hates gays?, they can ban gay centric sites.

Then go pay more. No one is stoping you, when your internet bill comes in pay double, who cares, it is your money. Shit give the access to charity. Simple. This does not affect you because you can afford it but it does affect far more people.      
Even if what you think is true, how does it affect you? The government helping people is bad? Tell me how this changes helps anyone but corporations. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:45:10
There needs to be a support group for people like us that are cursed or just make terrible decisions. I sold LTC the day before it tripled bought into BTC then it cratered to 14k

I feel burnt from LTC and that is where my negativity is coming from. I know my mistakes, I am an emotional investor. I stayed with LTC for a while and I sold the day before it mooned and bought BTC and BTC crashed to 13k. It was a heck 24hrs.    
What worries me is the fees and transaction time. I hope futures helps and to be honest I just learnt what futures is in the last few days.     
I am hodl cause to even buy back in LTC I would lose more than half of the coins I had before it mooned so I am between a rock and a hard place . I hope you are right.

So no more profits?
@_date: 2017-12-12 22:56:36
Yup, you are right. I really hope Sunday is good for BTC but it is tuesday and the market does not seem excited at all.

I agree, no one knew how it worked and if bitcoin would be shorted from the get go.   
Now we are in a new era where LTC got a shit ton of exposure because everyone transfered to LTC, everyone realised the cheap fees and quick transactions and I am afraid bitcoin is taking a second seat now while fees are high and it is taking long. I hope I am wrong tho. Just my perspective. I have no financial background. I really hope I am wrong and BTC moves over 20k.

@_date: 2017-12-14 21:48:24
Your only argument is INTERNET SERVICE IS NOT A RIGHT. And? Does that mean government should not try to make it available for everyone? At least affordable?    
Because in general, cooperation only care about profits. Customer don't matter. So anyway they can make money they will take.

LTC was doing nothing for so long. It was between 90-97 for ages. I was there when it ran up to 90 then the korean ban happened and it dropped down to below $30 and I was still a LTC believer. Seeing BTC run from 10k to almost 18k triggered me and I sold. Time will heal, still sucks tho. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:21:20
You need a hobby or a part time job. Do you have a family? Do you like traveling? Congrats on your new wealth but remember more money more problem. Goodluck. I know I will never get to the point you are at but I am trying and putting what I can in hoping for a better future.

Thanks for the reply
So say I sell and made a profit of $100 after 6 months, I have to pay 40% in taxes. If I reinvest it back into another crytocurrency does it continue? You only pay taxes once on an amount right? If you put it back in you don't pay 20% again on the same amount right?     
@_date: 2017-12-14 22:07:19
That is such a bad analogy.     
This is a better one. Lets say there is a company that supplies your water and you pay 60 a month and the company needed to make more money to make their shareholders billionaires so they decided to add cherry flavor and double it to $120 month. You hate it, okay but they are the only ones that provide water in your area, oh wait you can just buy bottled water, so you start buying that but then the company bought out that bottle water company and did the same, added flavor and doubled the price. What can you do? Well deal with it or start sterilizing your own water.   
The problem with your bakery analogy is that there are many variations of pastries, bread, etc. There are many bakeries everywhere. Shit, you can bake your own bread easily. There are many areas in america that has only comcast internet and people can't do anything.

BTC went up to 18k and crashed down to 13k before Sunday and now it is struggling to stay stable. This opened the floodgates for LTC to moon.

I said the poor would be affect from the decisions of the internet companies. That is the whole point of NN. To control how it is served. Nothing about raising the price. I mentioned the poor because you said you can just buy satillite or LTC which is far more expensive and less reliable. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 22:52:54
So a crash to 14k?
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:39:12
Depends on the exchange and network congestion.

I took a profit too since I was holding since it was in the 30's  but to see it moon like that after it was stuck around 90 for so long. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 17:31:49
I am not sure what you are asking. You have a limit and you take it out. Pretty simple. You think they will hold on to it and not give you? People transact with Coinbase constantly. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 22:22:31
CBOE had a negative impact tho so CME would drive it down to 5k?
@_date: 2017-12-13 21:42:23
I thought so but ltc has LN also.
@_date: 2017-12-13 22:07:48
What are you talking about? You are making no sense. Yes LTC has LN.
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:13:13
Except there was a thread just before it happened.    
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:46:18
It means pay your taxes.
@_date: 2017-12-12 22:41:23
Okay, so BTC mooned in anticipation just before CBOE weeks in advance and it is Tuesday and we can barely hold 17k just before CMO. I don't have faith.

That is not how it works. That left does not like big government to control people or make them dependant. They like government intervention when cooperations run wild fucking people or environment over in the name of profits.   
The right hates big governments because they love cooperations and doing whatever they want until it suits them then they want government intervention for help.

I would hate to think that they would just allow these investors to just fuck shit up as they see fit. Are there rules so shit doesn't go to shit Ina few hours? How can anyone allow them to just run shop and short it as they see fit?

What are you talking about? So you are saying they k ew they were going bailout so they said fuck it and do it?   
Regulation is used so could.oanies don't fuck over everything in the name of profits like destroying the environment. You are making no sense.    
No rules is always bad which is what regulations is.

Look at the bright side, what if you never invested in bitcoin? You would not have enough money to cover the cost.    
As far as I know Bitcoin did its job, it made you a profit that can save you for this situation.    
If you left it in a bank you would not have had enough money.
