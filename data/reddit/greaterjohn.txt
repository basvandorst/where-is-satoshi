One thing I'm CONCERNED with, but which will also drive up the price, is mining. The consumption of energy is enormous. It grows annually by 20%. Countries are going to start regulating this so that it doesn't get our of hand, as far as being a burden on the environment (hence the concern) and infrastructure. Previously, FOMO caused a large part of the price increase. Mining (for fees rather than actual BTC) will cause the price increase in the future.

Part of that problem is because the whole crypto space is fueled by trading pairs and despite use case.
@_date: 2018-05-31 14:24:56
Of course. But then I guess I don't understand the point of the post. Was it just to show the overall market loss? 
@_date: 2018-05-08 11:26:21
I honestly think they spread bad news, then sell off large amounts at slightly lower prices. They have enough of it to do so, triggering a sell off among the more nervous owners (not to be confused with investors). Then they buy back plus more after a few hours, before the market recovers. 
@_date: 2018-05-29 00:45:17
Omg! I see it!
First they both go up. And then they both go down!

I've never seen a single person trading based on fibonacci say that the price CAN'T go below or above a Fib point.
Candle box doesn't take into account FEAR. It doesn't take into account a 51% attack, or new mining tech that drops the price of electricity (which is one of the main sources of BTC value). It doesn't take into account that if you apply this "law" to all coins, some of them should go up, but go down instead only because BTC goes down. The math might be sound. Sure. I'll buy that. I know a mathematically perfect circle is, well, perfect. Mathematics on a graph that shows a single metric (price) can't predict where it will go based only on this metric, as price is the result of 1000 different factors. I've never seen a perfect circle happen in nature, and I never will. And there is a reason for that. Fractals and fibonaccis and zipfs and many other laws all conspire to screw up the perfect contours of pi. 
Just the other day I was told by some math expert that after the weekend, according to candle box "law", the price HAD to go up. Yet here we are, $200 drop in the last few hours. It's just $600 away from this year's ATL. I bet somebody will soon superimpose an even wider circle showing that the arc of the next price gain that "must" happen is a wider circle than the one previously shown. 
Granted, I think the price will increase again, and before EOY, we'll break 10,000, but not because of the necessity of this one "law."
Edit: here is that maths expert post arguing that the price HAS TO go up. You know what? The image is gone. 
@_date: 2018-05-28 15:25:02
I wouldn't go that far. BTC has value, and it has changed the lives of average people. But it can't keep gaining in value without changing demographics. 
@_date: 2018-05-23 16:58:33
Pi... Big pizza pie.
And Fibonacci? Zipf's law? Law of diminishing returns? Fear?
What of these? 
@_date: 2018-05-28 15:34:38
I know. The OP made no mention of candy box. When you chimed in with it, that's where I jumped in. 
@_date: 2018-05-14 12:47:08
Yeah, 6000 BTC is nothing that would create a sell off. If anything, it's some wealthy individual that sees a selloff coming and does so him or herself as a result and as a precaution.

Why MUST someone exit the circle in a specific place? It could be that there are numerous smaller circles, wheels within wheels, all driving this.

Try to avoid insulting people. You seem to have an assumption that people are not smart enough because they aren't interested in your theory. You seem to have an assumption that this is the right place to present such a theory at all? Go get your theory or "law" peer reviewed first. Come here with a different approach after that.
@_date: 2018-05-17 05:49:56
Hodl them. 
@_date: 2018-05-28 11:33:04
Except that the value of BTC isn't going to go up without banks and institutional backers now.  It was always an illusion that they were going away. Always an illusion that the poor masses alone would put their money in at ever increasing prices to somehow break the banks.
The irony here is that this gif applies all too well.

Shrugging my shoulders. Are you new to convincing people of ideas? If your theory works, apply its formulas to your own efforts at engaging with others.

If there are smaller rings, and this is continuous, all the way down to individual buyers, then there can't be a rule that you have to exit the circle where you enter. There will always be a lower level of nuance that modifies that rule on the larger scale.

There is no candle box law. There is a speculative hypothesis.

Whenever somebody says something tastes like shit, you have to wonder if they have actually tasted it. Which brings me to my point. Never mind if he heard BTC, his analogy has me wondering at his habits.

I said the following:
 
"Candle box doesn't take into account FEAR. It doesn't take into account a 51% attack, or new mining tech that drops the price of electricity (which is one of the main sources of BTC value). The math MIGHT be sound. Sure. I'll buy that. I know a mathematically perfect circle is, well, perfect.

I've never seen a perfect circle happen in nature, and I never will. And there is a reason for that. Fractals and fibonaccis and zipfs and many other laws all conspire to screw up the perfect contours of pi."
I'm being generous when I say the math may be sound. 
@_date: 2018-05-23 16:51:03
As I stated. This isn't math. There's no math to "do" here.

@_date: 2018-05-22 06:51:31
The answer is yes, you are just buying hoping it goes up. You are hoping someone else buys higher after you, that mining costs will get more expensive while transaction fees go down, that use cases will expand and not get replaced by other coins.
Please do research before investing. Or you'll back out with a loss as soon as the market quivers.
@_date: 2018-05-23 16:29:58
This isn't math. This is circles superimposed on a graph. You could just add easily superimpose a bigger circle that shows an even further drop. Or why not use elipses? The circles don't account for the peak at top left (i.e., it's not the center of a circle). There's also nothing that justifies the peak on the right. We could just add easily argue that the system will result in a symmetrical pattern, thus a fall after the wider circle.
I'm not saying that will happen, but this diagram is a poor man's weather forecast, as good as sticking a wet finger up in the air.

The guy isn't hungry for drama. He's doing research and it is quality research. He's just showing you something you don't want to see. The promise of the moon is only there for a few whales and lucky hodlers, dependent on late and ignorant buyers at the peak who are willing to buy in because of FOMO.
BTC's value is now price manipulated against magic monopoly money.

Everybody who sells up on the moon (during ANY point in bitcoin's history) sold to some sucker who bought up on the moon. There's no way around it.
