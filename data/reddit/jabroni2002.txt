It's a very gray area. Think of an activist hedge fund like Carl Icahn. Him buying the stock of a company is material to most other investors, but it's not actually material non-public information to the STOCK. 
In the same way, Peter Thiel buying bitcoin isn't actually material non-public information with regards to the technology planned forks etc of bitcoin. It's just him buying Bitcoin.
I personally strongly dislike these scenarios. In the prior example, in theory, activists keep companies from being entrenched and keeps the company on its toes etc. But there's always the thought in my mind that they actually just buy a lot of common stock and then a lot of options as well. Then they'll get on the news with an "action plan", make a lot of noise, sell there options clipping their intended profit, and then eventually sell their common shares saying "there's nothing to be done, management won't cooperate". pump and dump.

For real right now, all HODLs aside, in ANY investment, ask yourself if you are able to lose literally everything. 
Can you realistically lose half of you cash? 
Do you have an emergency fund set up in case you lose your job?
Do you have ample cash flow to have a budget and save money in lower-risk assets?
Don't get my wrong, I'm long and strong in a number of cryptos, but if they all literally went to zero, it would suck, but I would survive. For high risk investments most people recommend 1-5% of your investable assets. I'm above that, but I'm young so I have time, I have a strict budget set up, and I make sure I have emergency funds for both unforeseen health issues and unforeseen employment issues
