Yes you are correct. The seed phrase can be stored on paper however... The fire would destroy any and all record of your paper wallet (and it's contents) however with a hardware wallet, you still have the crypto.  You just need to purchase another h'ware wallet and enter the seed phrase that you stored at another location (crypto security 101) and you can then fully recover your funds.
Let's say you also stored a duplicate paper wallet in at another location, then yes, you could recover them however how many new users would do that.  Every time you wanted to make any moves or changes, you'd have to visit two locations and very few people are going to bother with that.  
For $100 for a h'ware wallet, you can have added security, added recovery and added ease of use.  I always suggest to any new users if they are serious about investing in crypto, then they need to invest in storing it too. ....  All this talk about toast is making me hungry....

I realised I didn't have the stomach to trade when I saw all these traits (and more) in my kids.  The plethora of emotions that work against you when trading start from a very early age.  Maybe its even in our DNA.

First post here so apologies if it sucks...
Another aspect is recovery.  Let's say you have a fire where your wallet is stored. 
If it's paper, it's toast.  However if it's hardware, you can simply purchase another wallet (eg ledger) and insert the recovery seed phrase/s and fully restore the wallet.
Security: If you're not confident about storing your seed phrase in the one location, break it up over three documents where you need at least two copies to recover.  That way, if anyone finds it and knows what it is, they have to figure out where one of the other copies is located.
I've not used a paper wallet so you may be able to do this also however let's be honest, most people using a paper wallet are new to crypto and won't follow all the guidelines on keeping your crypto safe.
