The best part about being depressed is when others tell you to get over it while chomping down their $200 steak dinner.
"Just keep thinking positively."
"Set goals."
"Look what I've attained."
"Take my advice and sell all your equipment and personal belongings."
It just makes you want to say I'm starving buddy, but I do appreciate the sentiment offered between glasses of wine; very comforting.
People don't want to see you die, but then again, if it costs them to see you live... well, the cost of living apparently is a bit too much to shoulder.  Not everybody has the same opportunities that others have.  Especially in this particular ecosphere; one man's gain is inherently dependent upon another's loss here.
But everybody buys low and sells high here, so what do we have to worry about?  This space is largely polarized; you have huge wallets holding and people starving and we're worried about whether Amazon will take Bitcoin.
You're right some people just need the sandwich.  I've bought plenty of them for people when I could in the past.  Now it's my turkey time, and not much going on.  It's hard to keep your head up.  But apparently, it's still my fault.
I think the worst part of depression is guilt and shame.  I don't even want to be a part of this for my personal wealth or well-being; that ship has long sailed.  I just want to be able to provide my brother with a better life than I've ever been able to have, and he doesn't even talk to me anymore.  I think that's the worst part of it all.  That people can become separated by just a small amount of difference in currency.
But with Bitcoin you can be your own bank.  Yeah the fuck right.

Not everybody has a cash infusion to start with, to keep capital influx flowing; comparing quantities over qualities with another is equivalently a palaver with no utility for either party of this conversation.  If you knew me and the people I've supported; the people I've buried, and what hells I've been through, it may be worth discussing like-mindsets over the course of a meal.
I don't doubt that a person with money is driven; perhaps even, should be driven, to acquire more capital and keep the ball rolling.  Why would I fault you for that?  Economies of scale need people with money to keep money flowing, including such avenues of wealth as land acquisition and management.  It took you a few hours to digest this, I suppose, and come back with a less than spot-on observation of what I was getting at.
I care not what your choice of fish and wine will be tonight, and any other.  I do not laud the thought process that a person in poverty, apparently by definition, deserves such poverty, as that must have been their final and ultimate goal.  As somebody with land in Indonesia, I'd imagine you see your fair share of rags stories that really never turn in to riches.  It must be because these people are choosing to stay poor, right?
That thought process is inherently harmful, and I do apologize that I brought out something within you to enunciate your feelings on the matter.  Not sure which is more negative, however; my simple question of whether you had tried to feed a hungry person, or the blanket statement you just made about people who may/not have your wealth in quantities of zeroes in a bank account (or, as you are trying to get into, zeroes in a bitcoin account as well).
We need people like you; that's the unfortunate part.  I suppose, please do us all a favor, and don't change, ok?  With great wealth comes responsibility, I wouldn't want you to have more on your plate than you could handle.

bah looks like everybody is glad-handing and looking for the cookie in the middle.
Appears to me to be a phenomenal waste of resources and seems to be reserved for people who have the time and the coin and an open-ended schedule to attend these.  For the commoner, these look like complete bullshit equivalent to that of no-girls comic book club.
"Look guys, this is how you use money."  "Let's set up a fuckload of tables with little to no employment opportunities to extend to outsiders, and let's all rent rooms in a hotel that we can write off as a business expense."  "lol, another speech about how revolutionary bitcoin is, but we exclude new adopters because basically they're the last ones shoveling in capital to keep the dream alive for us."
I'm with you, Bitcoin is awesome and I'm being a hater I'm not a millionaire from hoarding a few early ones.  But these things look like phenomenal international circlejerks and a competition to see who can be the coolest kid on the block in a conference because afterwards they slip back into obscurity.
Prove me wrong.  Find me one of those booths of people that is actually hiring people outside of their friends or colleagues, and has capital to spend.  I'm guessing that's going to be not many of them.
If Bitcoin was so awesome and about such economic freedom, then why is it not being used to crush the insanity of a trillion dollars of student loan debt that murders the commoner's chances of ever attaining a credit score?  Or where is bitcoin when medical costs are so inflated that it keeps your average single mother working at Stein Mart for 15 years while she raises a child in the ghetto?  You just had that conference in Washington DC.
Go down to a crack ward and see what real people problems are occurring in the world.  People bitching about receiving a Monarch "two weeks late" or if the bitcoin logo should look like a Thai Bhat or not are so fucking dissociated from reality, they may have never belonged in the first place.  And now, they've found a place at these lodge meetings.  How fucking quaint.
Again, appears to be nothing more than glad-handing.  Want to prove me wrong?  Expense out the costs to fly me to a conference, and put me up in a hotel.  I'm humble, I won't order room service, I'll chill my sodas in ice in the hotel sink, and the mini-fridge will stay locked.
I don't think it'll happen, so continue seeing the same people over and over again, who are doing the same non-action and sitting at the same draped-down folding tables in lobby areas, waiting for more people to pour in their money to "invest" in bitcoin.
To illustrate my point entirely, please provide me a list of five (5) bitcoin conferences that occurred prior to January 2013, when it would have been economically infeasible for so many people to be able to waste this much money to do this.

You have disposable income.  Can meet baseline bills and probably afford sodas or drinks with flavors instead of water.  I still see absolutely no reason to bitch.  If you have ambitions to do something greater, than vacate the opportunity for somebody in the muck and filth of entry-level or worse wages to take that position.
Oh, my job sucks, because I can afford my apartment, my car, my internet, my cell phone, my insurance, my water, my electricity, various credit cards, my mmorpg subscription, student loans, and let's not forget the fast food.

SR helped by attributing a value to the face of cryptocurrency itself.  I once was asked 'who sets the price of bitcoin' and quite literally I had not answer except for 'somebody else who believes it is also worth that price.'  Once I evaluated my statement I realized, no shit that is where the hold mentality and everything comes from, all of the current bitcoin adopters believe the shit has immense value and don't want to sluff it off for cheap anymore as before when it used to cost pennies.  The issue here is getting new capital in to the system at a rate that exceeds coins being mined.  Obvious ways to get attention are by pumping market price acutely.  However, it was nearly all of Spring and Summer last year when people started seeing, hey people are selling their illegal shit online and taking risks they normally would never take with cash and 'anonymity.'  It just makes fucking sense once you experience the technology in a situation that doesn't befit cash.  International money transferring is one I could see being a huge deal soon.

Can you elaborate on this positive thinking?  Apparently, you are saying the poor can wish themselves fed, happy, free from crime, disease, malnourishment, and unemployment?  Am I following you correctly when you are saying that people can just think themselves out of a situation positively?
To the man who is hungry, and has less than three figures in his bank account after bills on pay day, you deign to say "keep your head up, you're just thinking negatively; perhaps try thinking positively."  What opportunities will that immediately open up for him?  False expectations appearing as realities?  It may be great that you have donated sums or sizable ones at that, but was it really in altruistic earnestness?  Are we entirely sure that we didn't write such donations off to lessen one's tax burden, i.e. preserving one's own capital, in order to stay ahead of the curve?  Because, yeah it felt good to pay away the poorness, because heaven forbid if the reverse was the case, it may have been you waiting on your own charitable donation, which would've been sparked by the drive to lessen a tax burden, which we should be thankful for.
"I donated hundreds/thousands/millions/billions; I am not bereft of a soul now."  You said enough pretty much when you pocket-checked me on stating you've donated more aggregate than me.  And that's actually great, everything you've donated likely has gone to a good cause, I am honestly hoping.  But it's a lot easier to throw a stack of money at a situation, and say, "there, it's dealt with now, man I'm good."  It may be a waste of your time to interact with any of the less-thans; I completely understand, it wouldn't be furthering one's capitalistic goals.
But I need to ask, perhaps to placate my own ignorance, if you _honestly_ wanted to sell $.5M in land in Indonesia, for bitcoin, why of all avenues with which to do so, did you make a self-aggrandizing post on reddit as if this is the local Greensheet?  As somebody in the land business, are you not familiar with real estate agents, and would you not do your due diligence in trying to find a particular buyer through an agency, or other listing-type site?  Was this an advertisement you placed, or more of a "eh, fuckit, to the moon, 20% off for redditors who read this"-type message that's testing the waters for you?  Why don't you just sell that land legitimate for your $.5M, and purchase steady at the strike price for the next coming weeks?  Why not instead purchase $.5M of bitcoin, right now, and fleece off the land through normal channels and get your fiat investment returned?
Perhaps I don't have so many zeroes in my account, that Wells Fargo tells me "fuck you."  I guess I don't understand the utility of this OP that was made except to say "Hey guys, rich guy here, got some land for sale, trying to catch a grip of bitcoins aggregate on it, before I think the spot rate will go up."
Maybe I guess I'm just too poor to understand such concepts.  I'm thinking positively however, and looking at myself, and my goals, and would like to change my mindset.
Please, enlighten me.  I most pruriently need it, since my situation is dire and apparently, it's because of the way I was thinking.  Help me correct this.

Standard litany of reasoning follows:
- BUT PRICE DOESN'T MATTER IT'S A PROTOCOL
- YOU MUST BE NEW HERE
- QUIT BEING PISSY YOU'RE NOT AN EARLY ADOPTER
- TECHNICAL ANALYSIS MEANS NOTHING
- 300% YEAR OVER YEAR RETURNS
- IT MUST BE THE BEARS BULLING THE WHATCHAMAHOOSIT
- WHEN BITCOIN IS 10,000 YOU WILL BE SORRY
- P2POOL WILL FIX THIS
- LIGHTHOUSE OR WHATEVER
- ETHEREUM OR WHATEVER
- TREECHAINS OR WHATEVER
- COLORED COINS OR WHATEVER
And then the Mr. Bean rollercoaster gif.

If y'all haven't, you need to watch the movie [Belly]( preferably on some sort of time-dilation status.  It's not great, but it's a classic.  Well, yeah, it's pretty good for what it is actually.
Nas plays _Sincere_; DMX plays _Tommy_, before that motherfucker fell way the fuck off.

To be fair that dude is now the richest in the world and is attempting to fund such things as conquering diseases and unplanned births as well as poverty as a whole.  But yeah, he said one thing once, and you remembered it.

Some of us are too poor to be able to nag a business to be able to spend $5000 at it.  Must be nice how you have stuff set up.
But Bitcoin is all about helping the unbanked and remit markets...

This actually happened to me with 10 BTC in 2015.  I returned it and the work he offered me over the next few months with mining and profits from renting hashpower far exceeded that amount.
I also was loaned a small amount from a friend in 2014 and paid the amount back plus 10% in BTC.
Always do your best.

Right?  I think people selling at 17 aren't thinking of those willing to buy at 10 and when it stabilizes out at 20, well, we see the 17 guy being mad.

Are you referring to CryptoWall 3.0?  I know somebody who was infected by it on September 15, 2015 if you want me to ask him if it's ok.

I'm not sure if gaming is the correct term, more so that the difficulty increase made it unprofitable to mine, so it looks like a farm was turned off until it dipped to being less difficult, then immediately switched back on.

Just give her $10K like you did for Ross; I'm sure it'll go further with her than Ross's voodoo magic defense.
