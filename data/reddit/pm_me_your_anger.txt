I got in at $1260, which was about the highest of the highs (bitcoin went down to $1000 and then $800 in the following days) I bought at the absolute maximum, but I'm not even mad. 3-5 years from now I will know if it was a good decision

Are you even replying to me? It makes no sense to draw that conclusion. I bought into bitcoin because I believe cryptocurrency will soon be a huge part of our lives. If the price is $500, $60, $1200 doesn't matter, if bitcoin takes off it doesn't matter if I bought in at $1280. You should pm me sometime, because you seem very mad at something, perhaps it's envy?

It would have been shitty if I was doing day-trading with bitcoin, trying to buy and sell at peaks/lows.
You're the kind of guy who would say getting in at $10 was a bad decision because it collapsed shortly after, and then saying $280 was bad because it collapsed to $50 shortly after. Think long term and about the underlying technology.

You're thinking of bitcoin as stricly an investment opportunity, the general  participant of this forum hold a different view. 
But from an investors point of view: In hindsight we can say this was a local maximum (and in a couple of years we will see if it was a global maximum), but at the time of the decision this was not known. From a statistical point of view; a good or bad decision is not based on the actual outcome, but the probability of the outcome before the fact. Around November-December bitcoin was (and still is) very volatile, this makes it close-to-impossible to predict the outcome. If you believe in bitcoin you have to get in at some point, and there were a lot of people like you talking about $10 being the absolute maximum bitcoin would ever reach. At the time bitcoin was not widespread and no real uses of bitcoin (stores etc) were known, so perhaps $10 was a reasonable guess at the time, but what about now? Can you tell me how widespread bitcoin is in 3-5 years? Do you have anything at all to back-up the fact that the price of bitcoin will never raise above 1260 again besides hindsight? I think you're being fooled by a several logical fallacies (we are all victims of them every day) 
EDIT: I see you talk about people here having no sense of money, I think you're the armchair economist here. In your logic someone who invested in a promising company in August 2001 made the wrong decision because of September 11 2001, but at the time of the decision perhaps that was a good investment, but outside factors made the outcome bad. The point here is not to compare it to bitcoin, but to show how you your knowledge about finance, stastistics and logic is very flawed

Totally agree. The infrastructure bitcoin is building now is a million times stronger than it was just a year ago. Bitcoin would never survive this long if the idea/technology had major flaws. Now that we have several places like Overstock and Gyft accepting bitcoin, our next priority should be to make "ordinary" people use and understand (the basics) of bitcoin.

Yes the memories :) I followed bitcoin from the very beginning since my roommate (who is now a millionaire) was very much into bitcoin. I was a skeptic and chose not to take the time to mine (at that time you could mine a decent amount of whole bitcoins every single day). But I still followed the discussion and the price of it. This happened at $0.10, $2, $10, 50$, $230 just to mention a few. There is a possibility that bitcoin will never go above $1260, but people who argue that $1260 has to be the maximum with nothing to back it up are the same who said the previous tops were the maximums.. 
I tried to get in before thanksgiving 2013 when the price were just moving from the 2-300 level to around 800, but I had to liquidate some bonds and I didn't get to buy coins until mid-december. But again, I think about bitcoin as a promising technology, not only an investment opportunity.
