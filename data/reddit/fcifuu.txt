Thanks, I'm gonna have a look on it as soon as it's available for android.

I think this is no big deal, just a thought.

update: I just did exactly the thing I described above with my wife. After years of trying to convince her to get into crypto she owns her first fraction of a btc. Asking her why she finally decided to try it out, she said: Because it was that easy.
High five guys! ��

That's exactly what I think of it. But this may not fit for those who bought a ath.

I wouldn't call anyone smart who seriously claims to know where we're going

1. Someone please develop a nice, easy to use hybrid mobile wallet &amp; trading app that immediately rebuys the amount of btc and other cryptos when I spend them so that I can easily spend and hodl at the same time. 
2. Accept bitcoins at your store/business if you have one.
3. Everything about buying, selling and accepting bitcoins needs to become much more easy so that EVERYBODY gets the chance to become part of it even he or she doesn't know anything about how this works. 
4. Compare the act of taking a digital photo with a camera, transferring it to your desktop computer, dialing up to the internet, browsing to your e-mail account, logging in, attaching the photo to an e-mail (shit, it's super-high-res 4MB, I need to compress it first) , and sending it to a friend back in 1998 with doing the same thing with your smartphone today if you doubt that crypto is still in it's infancy.

Thank you for this helpful explanation!

Congrats, honestly! Even if the price will drop further on the short term: you've done your own research, made a decision and seem to be confident about it. That's great! If you truely are convinced of bitcoin, never give away all of them.. or just if you need to. Good luck for your plans!

that was even pre-hitler. a  democratic "deutsches reich" has existed before he took over and fucked it in the ass.

I think this could be true and the answer to many questions. Can't imagine that the majority of institutional investors would register an account on coinbase or bitstamp for example.

Can someone explain the "running my own bank" thing in easy words to me? I like the idea of running a node just to support the whole thing, but I always supposed that this would have no personal benefits besides having a "voice" when it comes to decisions
