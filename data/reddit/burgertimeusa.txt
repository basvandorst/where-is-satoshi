I was considering investing in one with my friend. I went through the process and it’s kind of a pain in the ass. Doesn’t accept debit or credit. Cool feature was that it can generate and print out a paper wallet for you. I feel like that could be a security risk though.

As we all know, Bcash was released on Coinbase a few hours ago, followed by a massive spike and subsequent correction. It topped out at nearly $9k, but that’s not reflected in the daily chart. What the hell is going on? It’s almost as if they want to cover it up to present Bcash as a viable coin.

It’s really a crazy psychological phenomenon. If you look at the graph from all time, it hits an all time high and the dips super low and then rises to another all time high and then dips again before exponentially rising another time. Over and over again. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 01:51:46
Oh, ok, yeah, it’ll work. You just need to find the vendor who accepts that form of payment.

There is no standard price for BTC. Price differences between countries is the result of supply and demand, market size, and exchange value, among other factors.

You’d probably have a lot more brain cells as well. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 01:16:04
Most secure thing is probably a paper wallet, but there are going to be inherent risks associated with whatever solution you choose. I’m using a Trezor right now and I never keep anything in Coinbase, any other exchange, or anything that doesn’t grant me control over my private keys. If you control your private keys, you’d still be granted an equal amount of whatever coin results from the fork so long as you’re holding BTC prior to it occurring.
@_date: 2017-11-11 06:54:51
Get a Trezor. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 05:51:06
No... Hell no, man... I believe you get your ass kicked asking something like that.

I thought it was pretty douchey and pretentious when I first heard people calling this area "Silicone Beach," but it's really caught on. So much so that I wasn't even aware I was using the term. 
But then again, Hulu, Snapchat, Google, and a bunch of other tech giants all have headquarters here, so it's not really that crazy. Not to mention the other million tech companies like mine that are in the area. 
I don't really care what it's called. The rent prices are too high now because of all the tech dweebs, so we're going to move the office to the valley. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:28:42
Might get downvoted to hell, but I don’t think that bitcoin will do that, but blockchain technology will, specifically private blockchains. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 23:26:20
But multiple block chains can be linked and interact with one another. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 01:32:49
Yeah, but debit is an instant buy, so if you don’t want to spend the money, you’re going to have to wait.

@_date: 2017-11-30 16:19:54
Depends on the amount you want and how often you’d want to replenish that amount. If it were an long term operation that demanded a high budget, investing in a proprietary mining operation would probably be the most practical method of obtaining coin and establishing a stake in the crypto space. Otherwise, an exchange would be best or even reaching out to miners directly. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 01:33:07
Not sure. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 01:53:34

GDAX is run by Coinbase and uses the same payment processing scheme. If he doesn’t want to a wait a week, the only solution is using a debit card.
@_date: 2017-11-17 04:47:54
I don't know where you're located, but I've seen plenty of job opportunities here in Los Angeles. I work in the Silicone Beach area though, so my view is probably pretty skewed.

I’d say go for it. Just about all my extra money goes into BTC. Sounds like you’re new at this though. Generally, I’d recommend taking a couple days to think about it, but the price could very well be over $10K by then. I took some time to think about it before I initially invested and when I finally made up my mind, the price had raised significantly. Our course, that was back in the day when it was less than $200 a coin. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 04:53:33
Shoot me a PM.
@_date: 2017-11-09 01:28:59

I’ve used it before. It’s been around for a while. Unless something changed since I used it, it’s legit. Don’t take my word for it though, do some research or your own and ask around.

Yeah, that’s definitely a possibility, but would also present further security risks to the scammer. The more transactions they send, the more vectors they present that would allow the movement of funds to be traced back to them. 
@_date: 2018-11-12 17:24:08
It might seem pretty obvious to some of us, but people actually fall for this crap. The scammers address has received 97 transactions for a total of 3.62 BTC so far.

Before you put any more time or effort into this project, be sure to do some research on what's already in development because I've encountered quite a bit of material in relation to what you've summarized in your post. Also, if what you're proposing is based on blockchain technology, it'd probably be best to educate yourself rather than depend on someone else. It's awfully difficult to find anyone with a working technical understanding of blockchain technology. Sounds like what you're looking for would be a function of smart contracts. Check out the Hyperledger Project from the Linux Foundation if you get a chance. I'm no expert, but I have a pretty good understanding of blockchain, so feel free to hit me up with any questions.
@_date: 2017-10-27 05:44:19
Yeah, but if it’s still in development, it’s not piggybacking, it’s competing, and if you have a tenuous grasp on how blockchain technologies function, how do you expect to reasonably compete with an entire development team? Not trying to be a dick, just throwing it out there. If you’d like to contribute to the advancement of blockchain, the best thing to do is learn how it works and get involved in the community. Distributed ledger technology isn’t all that complicated and can be applied to multiple industries outside of cryptocurrency. I think the technology itself is even more valuable than Bitcoin and could even change the internet as we know it.

From u/AtLeastSignificant:
“Blockchain would prevent the data from ever being lost/wiped away for sure.  That's part of the immutability guaranteed by the decentralized storage and compounding cryptographic assurance intrinsic to the blockchain itself.
Blockchain alone is not a good solution for voting though because it doesn't have any identity characteristics.  However, this is not a difficult thing to fix.
I think the simplest way is for a state to create a token contract and give people a private key to an address that has 1 token.  Then they vote by sending the token back to the contract using the candidate-specific function.  You avoid the issue of people accidentally identifying themselves in the case that the token is sent to a personal address already owned by the user, but you do introduce other privacy and manipulation issues.
A Civic style option is the better way to go.”
