This. You pretty much need a bank these days to buy BTC.

But you need the banks to buy BTC

This post made by someone who doesn't know the history of BitCoin and why the name Satoshi is given to respect its creator.

Yes it tastes better if you use a different currency because the ingredients magically change :)

As long as you don't charge a 5% interest rate or anything like that like the credit card companies do.
Just sell the card. The card is what should have value. You should NOT earn any revenue from us using it.

It could also be any other altcoin. What is Litecoin? What is Stablecoin? What is Altcoin?

Stop posting this, seriously, in a few days you're going to get the deposit and you'll be like "oh okay whatever" just like every other time!
Do you really need to make a thread every single time you make a stupid deposit? Who cares? Imagine if everyone did that asking for attention "Please up for visibility!!!"
But of course this thread gets lots of up arrows because they see the "$4000" and think, whoaaaa that's a lotta monay babay, I gotta support this guy cause there's a 0.0001% chance he might lose it! In translation though it's 5 BTC. It's a small, miniscule amount of BTC.
DEAL WITH IT.

What a NIGHTMARE!!
Dealing with large amounts of cash is such a pain, digital currency is the way to go

I'm glad you're not like the OP though, because every single transaction he does on Coinbase, he makes a new thread and goes "please up for visibility" or at least someone does
Ridiculous, every time it turned out okay too

I know that feel bro T_T

yes but BTC transactions are not regulated, people have been scammed because cops won't do anything if someone steals your BTC
