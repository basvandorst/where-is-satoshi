No he didn't or not?
"In 2009, he started a company that he said would manufacture plants from the Belize jungle into antibiotics. His lab was raided in May 2012 by the police department’s Gang Suppression Unit on suspicion he was manufacturing methamphetamine. He says the raid was retribution for his refusal to be extorted by the government. No illegal drugs were found during the raid. He was never charged and the lab was eventually shut down.
The Belize government declined ABC News’ request for comment.
McAfee was catapulted to the headlines again in November 2012. This time Belizean authorities linked him to a more serious crime, naming him "a person of interest" in the mysterious slaying of 52-year-old Gregory Faull, a U.S. man who was McAfee’s neighbor two doors down from McAfee’s beachside compound. McAfee went into hiding, telling ABC News at the time he was afraid the authorities were trying to kill him.
He has denied any involvement in Faull's death.
After being on the run for almost a month, McAfee was arrested in Guatemala by Guatemalan immigration officials for entering the country illegally. He was about to be deported back to Belize when he collapsed. McAfee later said he had faked a heart attack.
“Sure, I faked it"

So how can I run one ? Can I run it on Nodejs?
@_date: 2019-02-06 07:02:40
That's because Jack only owns Bitcoin
@_date: 2019-02-21 21:18:51
Maybe ;)
@_date: 2019-02-06 17:06:41
@_date: 2019-02-20 02:27:52
That's not true! +$85 because you have to download the whole blockchain to run your LN node.

@_date: 2019-01-01 16:28:31
No :'( I'm in Africa, it's banned!
@_date: 2019-01-01 12:06:11
Some people can't buy from coinbase since it's not available in many countries!! So they have to pay more than this fees!! There is no other way around it.
