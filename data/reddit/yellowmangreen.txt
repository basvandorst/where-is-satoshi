Lazy Americans addicted to cheap credit think that's how the world always was and always will be. Hilarious.

It would be insane if countries abandoned their currencies for bitcoin. That's not how it works, different regions have different economic outputs, they can't tie themselves all to the same currency without severely hampering or destroying their economies.
They'll create their own cryptocurrencies once the usefulness of bitcoin is apparent to all. Banks WILL disappear. Lenders will not.

You don't really understand what this is all about, do you?

your mind cannot even comprehend how 99% of past and present humanity has worked without banking/credit.
@_date: 2014-12-29 05:14:36
Are you seriously implying that humanity's progress over the last 300 years is due simply to banks' issuing credit? Are you absolutely insane?

i don't think you understand that banks are not created to be lenders. their first order of business has always been, throughout all of history, as holders of depositors' value. as a side benefit, they have historically been able to steal their customers' wealth to lend to others while they operate a depositors pyramid scheme to fund withdrawals. 
this WILL disappear and IT SHOULD.

Aaah, it is well known that the head of the MoF in Russia is part of the fifth column. It is excellent that the Russians are now mobilizing against the parasites in their country.

That's why I'm not wasting my time over there and I'm posting here. =)

Ask him why there have been recent outbreaks of [Chikungunya]( wherever his Polio vaccination program starts up?

That's not Crimea. It's like saying Florida is Ohio.

Since the Russian sanctions you can't pay Russian companies through paypal. You just get a discreet, "not available at this time" message.

On what? His foreknowledge? Or the poisoning?

You did not read any of the pages I linked. That much is obvious. Good luck in life.

Bill Gates is a convicted monopolist who set back the tech world by 20 years and has spent the better part of the last 3 decades stifling and destroying innovation. He is the fucking anti-christ.

Yes, entirely. Possibly (I highly doubt), without his knowledge.

My previous comment has been downvoted beyond the threshold. More people need to see the evidence for Rotary Club sponsored vaccination drives. They are currently Ramping up in Central America. Someone does not want you to see this information. 
Gates Foundation Polio Vaccination programs work through Rotary Clubs. They are the unwitting boots on the ground that do the grunt work and distribute the vaccines. The following is mostly Panama specific information:

Well, I guess I'll spoon feed you. Gates Foundation Polio Vaccination programs work through Rotary Clubs. They are the unwitting boots on the ground that do the grunt work and distribute the vaccines.
Here it is from the horses mouth of what they're doing in your country:

The enemy of progress and harbinger of technological death. Fuck this coward.

That's probably because people around the world will en mass start murdering bankers. I concur, with his assessment.

You're being ridiculously disingenuous if you're equating the internet to HTTP. If you want to make a VALID comparison, Bitcoin is the same as TCP/IP. Which came about in 1975. Bitcoin's HTTP doesn't even exist yet.

If you want to lose all your money, then store it on NAND memory. Jesus Fucking Christ, what a terrible idea.

He doesn't own it and he can't destroy it like he has done with everything else involved in the OS sphere. Of course he fucking hates it.
