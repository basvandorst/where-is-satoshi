English is not my native language so I might not express myself in the most clear manner. 
Would you mind explaining how Bitcoin et al. is inflationary?

The point I meant to make is something else that does not increase in value and therefore discourages selling it. Byteball is an interesting currency. I think many cryptocurrencies will be able to live in harmony/symbiosis.

That's something I'm not sure of. Why buy it when it has no utility? Maybe a way of storing value (a number) securely, decentralised and with no cheating is enough of a utility to make people invest in it? I mean, the latest price increase is in a currency which practically is only used for trading to other currencies.
Feel free to correct my thinking, I'm just throwing it out there.

I used to believe Bitcoin was the future of all commerce but not anymore. The deflationary nature of Bitcoin is not suited for everyday commerce. 
What I believe Bitcoin will be is where you will save your funds. Like your own bank or gold as it is commonly compared to here. We will then exchange Bitcoin for other cryptocurrencies that are not deflationary and does not have a large transaction fee, like Ethereum or Montero or some other currency suited for what you will be doing.
I'm no economist though, and LN might make Bitcoin for coffee-purchases viable, but this is what I believe at the moment.

No, I believe the wallet will detect a fork. Also, the server would have to be running a BCH-node for that to happen.

And it is currently *by far* the best implementation. The original implementation is abandoned in favour of ElectumX.
All this is is a naming convention. He chose to name the segwit bitcoin fork "bitcoin-segwit" and using "mainnet" for BCH, probably in part because he is a proponent of BCH. This is used in a config variable in ElectrumX, forcing server owners as myself to change the variable from mainnet to bitcoin-segwit if you are on the segwit fork.
IMO he should also have changed BCH to "bitcoin-cash" or something, keeping the software politically a bit more neutral.

There won't be enough jobs for the people that can work. That is the reason for UBI.

Blocks were mined. It's normal.
