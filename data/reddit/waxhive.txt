it's to bad the height of esports has long passed.  They tried and ruined it.  CPL, ESWC, (That china league I forgot the name of), oh to be young again.. I competed at 5 CPL's and played Counter-Strike from beta - 1.6.. Played Cal-M for 7 seasons and never made it to CAL-I(This was before Cal-P existed when CAL-M &gt; CAL-I was the transition I switched to 1v1 games)..  
I also competed in Quake, Quake 2, and Quake 3 @ Quakecon(but never was very good..)
I placed in the money in HALO PC(LOL!) @ CPL.. 
esports today are pretty lame compared to when I was growing up.  It's nothing but a bunch of WoW and MOBA games and that's about it.  CS:GO is pretty lame lol and there hasn't been a good 1v1 game in i don't know how long.. Quake 4 was miserable.

did you not read at all what I said?  I said its nothing but MOBA's.. that shits boring as fuck and takes very little skill at all.  Bring back the 1v1 high speed FPS games that actually take skill.

dont.  start building other things unless you just REALLY want to make apps.  I get just as much enjoyment out of building enterprise level software as cheesy apps that no one much cares about.
One thing i've learned about apps is people don't have much love for them.  They use them when standing in line, or waiting around, but its not something they really care about.  Learn to build websites/desktop apps/etc that's my suggestion.  
The only reason I'd build an app these days is if it compliments some other app i'm working on.  The chance of success in the app space is just to small these days.  THe moats are to small too.  If you come up with something good and this is often the case in the app space, someone will steal the idea, regurgitate it and end up with all the reward.  2048 is a great example of this

You're well on your way to being a developer.. my tip to you is move away from App development.  It's ok, but the race to the bottom has already happened.  To many apps, not enough people to pay for them.
I too started learning to code when I was 14.  It prepared me for a future where I got to start working debt free without needing that pesky college degree.  I'm now 32 and a full time developer.  I have no huge baggage of college student loan debt and all the benefits of being a rock start developer. 
Start building your portfolio now and the sky is the limit for you my friend.  Welcome to the never ending enjoyment of development(if that's what you want to do in life.)  
When I was your age it was different though, everyone told me I was wasting my time learning to code silly apps for AOL.  this was in the mid 90's when the internet first really became a thing.  We did all sorts of nefarious stuff like stealing peoples AOL accounts, etc.  The internet was a true wild wild west.  It was good times.  
Great start! onwards and upward

i do not recommend storing bitcoins in anything related to MultiBit.. See their past history in handling bugs within their software causing users to lose substantial amounts of bitcoins and the owners giving no fucks until the community put their ass to the coals.

I strongly support and continue to press for greater congressional oversight of the Fed’s regulatory and supervisory responsibilities, and I believe the Fed’s balance sheet should be regularly audited – which the law already requires,” Ms. Warren said in an emailed statement. “But I oppose the current version of this bill because it promotes congressional meddling in the Fed’s monetary policy decisions, which risks politicizing those decisions and may have dangerous implications for financial stability and the health of the global economy.”

The developer of multibit refused to fix a critical bug in their original software that was causing users to lose Bitcoins until the community basically shamed them into it.  His near exact words were and I quote, "I can't afford to work on both MultiBit and MultiBit HD, I have one light bulb and don't get paid. I can only run my lights for a few hours a day."
Those are paraphrasing, but that's the gist of it.  His software continued to cause people to lose Bitcoins for a very long time and still has LOTS of bugs.  I wouldn't suggest it to my worst enemy.
I could care less if anyone hears my warning, but I'm telling you its not software i'd trust in the slightest.
@_date: 2015-02-05 11:57:03
here.. is the stupid quote about his electricty...
MultiBit dev here. This is not the way to ask for support on open source projects.
For anyone with a support query about MultiBit please look at the help page on multibit.org. There are a number of articles on 'quick fixes' and then the user is pointed to the github issues page:
This solves probably 99% of people's issues.
The OP contacted me by bitcointalk.org privately. Hmm, if privacy is a real issue then that's ok but github is better as it is more efficient (e.g. searchable). But then the OP just posted all my replies on reddit which is hardly privacy aware.
Generally in life if someone says they are 'too busy' to help it either means:
A) There are brushing you off.
B) They actually ARE too busy.
Let me explain why B) is the case here.
Since October 2013 Gary Rowe and I have been working on the next version of MultiBit (MultiBit HD). It has a lot of improvements. Critically for this thread it has deterministic wallets which makes private key regeneration possible and reduces significantly the chance of private key loss. In addition it has rolling backups, local backups and cloud backups.
It's a big job and it's probably still a month from being in beta. I work on it every day. I mean EVERY day. I cannot remember the last day I had a completely free day (except for last Christmas).
You can only do so much so there are a whole stack of things in my personal life that are on hold to get MBHD out the door.
To give one example: My electricity is run from solar/ diesel, running through a battery store. The batteries are old and need replacing. (This is normal - they only last 1000 recharges or so).
So I need to replace them - this will take a few days to take out the couple hundred kilos of batteries, replace them, wire them up, dispose of them etc.
This job is on hold until MBHD is out. So my power envelope in the evening is about 6 watts. I can have a couple of 3W LED lights on. That's it.
Getting MBHD out the door will help improve the security of a lot (hundreds of thousands) of people's private keys so I don't mind making a 'short term' sacrifice. By short term I mean six months.
I hope this explains why I told you that there isn't personal support for MultiBit at the moment. The good thing with wallets and bitcoin is that generally they don't go anywhere (except when stolen). Just keep your wallet/ logs etc secure.

that's a horrible plan.. making your layout function(especially the landing page which was suppose to sell me on your service, the rest could have waited i guess) is easy enough to do while you're building it out.. In fact its much easier to build a responsive site from the beginning instead of trying to shoe horn in a responsive site.  
I'm a software developer, i've built and launched a few startups, and have a very successful app now(not in the bitcoin space).. i'm telling you from experience.  Instead of selling me, I was laying on the couch reading reddit, went to your site and immediatley bounced probably to never return again..
