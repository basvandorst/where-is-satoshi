Is $1K a lot for you to lose? If not buy now
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:01:41
Could go down for sure.  Don't think so though.  Next ride to $22,222.22
@_date: 2018-01-16 17:56:03
What % of your worth is invested? If &lt;10% don't even think about selling.

As others suggest, don't share any of the info including details such as the bitcoin balance. Look around this sub and the internet to learn more about bitcoin until you feel comfortable retrieving/cashing out any bitcoin. 
I would also suggest that once you cash out to only cash out a very small portion that way you know you understand how it works and you don't mess up. Many people have made mistakes transferring bitcoin and have lost all their coins as some actions cannot be canceled. 
Also bitcoin has taken a hit in the last couple weeks. Don't understand your situation and you may need any money ASAP but it may be worth to not cash all of it out.

Agree don't put all your eggs in one basket but wasn't worldcom a telecom company. Hard to compare that to a world currency. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:22:39
OP should take a personal finance course
@_date: 2018-01-08 23:03:14
People predict the end of the world all the time.  Eventually someone will be right unless they're not. 
Same here. 
@_date: 2018-01-15 22:32:45
Then it doesn't and you lose your money. 
What would be more painful to you. Losing all/most of your investment or someday realizing your investment could have made you a 3x, 5x etc return. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 19:06:15
Really up to you how much you want to put in. But looking long term, it's a pretty good time to buy. IMO
@_date: 2018-01-23 16:43:22
Not sold on that until we start reaching 13K levels 
@_date: 2018-01-15 22:21:43
Yes it's also a gamble. But stocks can be less risky/volatile compared to crypto. Unless you also gamble/invest in single stocks such as new bio tech stocks. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 21:44:43
How many financial advisors actually know about and understand crypto to give legitimate advice? Not too many would be my guess. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 23:00:49
Think right below 10K was the floor. Then again no one knows. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:02:43
If it does go down that low it won't be in a week. Couple months maybe, doubt it though. 
@_date: 2018-05-15 21:02:49
Same. After the fee increase I have switched most of my activity over to GDAX.
@_date: 2018-06-29 00:43:32
What a rollercoaster we are on. 
@_date: 2018-06-29 00:56:56
Good thing this isn’t a literal rollercoaster. 
@_date: 2019-06-26 18:55:13
When I first read your comment I laughed. Now I’m hoping you did start lol
@_date: 2019-06-26 05:06:32
gulp, do we need to get 13K memes cooking?
@_date: 2019-04-03 15:31:32
I agree that coins shouldn’t be left on an exchange IF you are holding long term. However, there are a lot of traders in the market and for that group it doesn’t make sense. 
@_date: 2018-02-18 16:25:42
or just open an Ally savings account and get 1.45%
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:46:07
Should be selective when taking advice from internet strangers. Sure some will hold on no matter what but don't hold just because of the meme. How would you feel if it reaches 2k and doesn't rebound for several months/years? Based on current TA for the last several weeks, it's more likely we are heading to a 2-5K range than we are to bounce back above 10K. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:02:22
@_date: 2018-02-21 00:49:56
What?? ��
@_date: 2018-02-06 18:30:55
TA not indicating this is going to stop going down. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 22:56:33
Couple weeks ago I would have laughed at that sentiment but now it's starting to feel inevitable. 
@_date: 2018-02-15 02:58:45
Almost feel bad for those who take their advice. 
@_date: 2018-02-17 23:45:40
Lol I tried 
@_date: 2018-02-02 19:22:42
Was it a big bad wolf or a tiny cuddly boi?
@_date: 2018-02-02 18:33:38
1M subs
@_date: 2018-02-21 00:51:43
Believe more people sold than bought.
@_date: 2018-02-24 23:44:07
The ultimate FOMO ��
Good luck ��
@_date: 2018-02-06 17:17:47
Just wait and buy at 2K. Sad time. 
@_date: 2018-02-17 19:15:39
Robinhood crypto is not yet available to all. If I’m the US I would vote for Gemini. 
@_date: 2018-02-17 22:28:40
You can but there is a MUCH higher fee if you buy through the app. It’s more convenient but expensive. If you have a Coinbase account you also have a GDAX account, it’s all the same company. I would strongly suggest using the GDAX site for buying instead of the Coinbase app. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 18:32:04
This again. It's like the reverse of FUD. Hope it's right but still.
@_date: 2018-03-29 21:58:00
No worries. Think long term. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:58:16
Christmas 2020?
@_date: 2018-02-01 15:23:43
Alternatively it never recovers
@_date: 2018-02-06 17:15:14
Exactly, he buys well running businesses and allows them to continue running those businesses. Very little micromanaging. Plus blockchain is not just cryptocurrency, there are many applications to the chain. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:03:17
Almost inevitable 
@_date: 2018-02-17 19:21:05
I would use GDAX and add your bank account info. Alternately you should also look into Gemini. 
@_date: 2018-02-17 15:45:07
This stuff is all too new and not enough “advisors” know it well enough to give credible advice. Just stick with yourself. Just don’t be too risky and learn!
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:27:30
Can't say that either, burst doesn't happen overnight 
@_date: 2018-02-24 19:00:08
Just one?
@_date: 2018-02-06 18:31:58
Hope, wish, pray all the above

@_date: 2018-02-24 20:12:58
How much does that refund mean to you? Are you okay with possibly losing most of it and/or be tied away for months? I’m bullish on Bitcoin but it’s always a risk. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:46:45
At time of OP comment it had not gone under 7K. Then I posted when it did. 
@_date: 2018-02-23 23:01:48
I agree that it goes against the Bitcoin philosophy. However, you have to realize that not everyone buying into Bitcoin, especially as of late, have done so because they believe in Bitcoin. 
Many truly see it as just an investment and a way to get quick gains. RH appeals to these investors plain and simple. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 18:43:56
Thought the sarcasm was self evident. Obviously I don't know what I'm talking about, just like everyone else. 
@_date: 2018-04-05 20:12:29
Nice 240!
@_date: 2018-04-25 00:18:41
Grab whatever is close to you and hold on for dear life.
