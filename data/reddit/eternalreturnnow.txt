interesting how you ignore federal, state, and local tax abatements, subsidies, and relocation expenses for these "projects", which have in many cases far outweighed any "investment into the economy."
here's an amazing example, and not a bs anecdote like yours. indiana paid Carrier 7 million in tax breaks to keep a mere 1000 jobs in indiana. [
Those jobs are now gone lol. [
stop defending the entrenched elite and the corrupt system they profit off of.

not in the U.S. lmfao. there are so many shelters, exceptions, loopholes that the rich as a proportion of a country's tax is quite low.
edit: oh, yours was a rhetorical bs question to make people think they do when they don't lol
