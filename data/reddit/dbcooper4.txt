Tell that to the person who bought at $19k and is down 40-50%.

Small difference - the people who bought in at ~$19k are (still) in the red. Hindsight is 20/20 and nobody knows what will happen in the future.

More likely you will just disappear and stop posting here if you are wrong.

If Bitcoin goes from $10k to $1k (90% drop) it would still ‘only’ be where it was one year ago...It’s funny how people only want to make that point on the way up but forget it on the way down.

Nobody can predict the future. Anyone who tells you they can is a huckster. I wish all of the people who are so sure Bitcoin will go way higher would put their money where there mouth is a buy as much as possible at the current prices.

Sorry, but the Bitcoin pumpers don’t have a clever meme for people who have lost money on Bitcoin.

I think Bezos lost like 90% in his Amazon stock value (billions of dollars) when the dot com bubble burst and it took like 10 years to recover. Then there’s the NASDAQ which peaked at 5k in the late 90’s and took like 15 years to recover.

Or saying 10 years ago “Lehman Brothers is a great investment at $25 a share.”

The frenzy in the news stories has cooled now that it’s down 40-50% from ATH. And to be fair, plenty of commentators were calling the Bitcoin price moves a classic bubble.

The hindsight bias thing drives me crazy. Everybody remembers the profitable trades they *could’ve made* but nobody remembers the unprofitable trades they avoided.

Probably real estate.

You can’t. Some people have multiple accounts. That way they can only see comments posted from that account.
