bitcoin is basically a meme, right?
@_date: 2017-12-23 18:51:17
Yeah, none of that would meet my definition for fundamentals.
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:49:38
But bitcoin doesn't offer the best technology, there are tons of alternatives and very little barrier to entry for new coins coming to market. The brand is the product at this point.
@_date: 2017-12-25 02:21:13
So bitcoin is a way to avoid taxation, but what makes it any more valuable than any other coin or a Princess Di beanie baby (sold under the table)?
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:50:47
why does bitcoin have more growing to do? what price do you think it should hit and what is your rationale for thinking that?
@_date: 2017-12-23 17:23:59
Interesting. What are the fundamentals of bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-23 18:46:48
Sort of like gold but why isn't it more like beanie babies? Want to store money in beanie babies? You need to buy bean babies.
@_date: 2017-12-23 18:49:53
Special edition Beanie Babies do have a finite supply. 
Something isn't valuable just because there's a finite supply.
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:39:50
right, but why do you decide it's worth more or less? what goes into that calculation other than media stories bringing in people who have no idea how this stuff works with the promise that it could be worth more?
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:48:04
okay, i would just recommend that you look at the bear case from a non-dismissive perspective.
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:42:24
Does it say anything about the viability of BTC that people who believe in it should 'stfu'? Like, don't criticize it or it might collapse?
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:40:33
It is absolutely a brand.
@_date: 2017-12-30 17:19:38
bitcoin is stupid
@_date: 2017-12-23 22:01:42
It's literally not a strawman. Please read the progression of our conversation as it should help you understand in this situation. Otherwise we can start over at the beginning of the logic progression. This is essential to understanding the bear market position and being responsible.
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:10:56
If the idea is that 'primacy counts for a lot', but there isn't any fundamental argument for why bitcoin should be number 1 (or worth anything at all really) isn't it basically just a brand then?
@_date: 2017-12-23 03:12:58
I get that. I also get that it reads multiple ways. Interesting that you talk about 'fundamental changes' when bitcoin has never traded on fundamentals. There's a lot of cult-like behavior thinking in the crypto scene.
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:53:16
Is this comic equally applicable to regular bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-23 18:54:19
It is not a strawman argument. I would challenge you to really take a deep look at what I'm saying with an open mind.
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:54:10
Why is bitcoin worth like $12k today when it was worth like $19k a week or two ago? 
And if there's not any fundamental reason beyond 'that's what people will pay', then why shouldn't it's price swing from $12k to $1k or $50 or $0 -- especially with so many other coins out there? 
Why is the Bitcoin brand worth $12k when the brand is essentially the whole product at this point?
@_date: 2017-12-25 00:02:16
What is demand for bitcoin based on? Also, we already established that there are limited edition beanie babies that are supply constrained.
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:43:40
why are you basing bitcoin's potential on the earth's population? why does that make sense? even if that kind of model did make sense, why wouldn't a different crypto currency be the beneficiary?
as an example of why this logic doesn't make sense, plug in 'beanie babies' everywhere you use the word 'bitcoin' or 'crypto currency' in your post.
@_date: 2018-02-02 10:25:55
wrong. people have been pumping bitcoin and now the energy is gone. 
bitcoin under $1,000 by end of the year.
@_date: 2018-02-02 13:39:19
oh please, it's the natural reaction to all the bitcoin gloating and 'tfw nocoiner' stuff. bitcoin is also stupid so a lot of us are looking forward to it zeroing. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 10:10:21
it's the end of bitcoin. there's going to be a rush to the door and a lot of people are going to lose their shirts. today's a good day to get out if you can.
@_date: 2018-02-02 12:55:24
that's a plenty dumb statement.
@_date: 2018-02-02 10:15:40
people thought bitconnect was the next bitcoin but it turns out bitcoin is the next bitconnect.
@_date: 2018-02-02 10:21:47
@_date: 2018-02-02 12:00:37
that time was after mount gox. every gain afterwards has been a lucky blessing.
sell your bitcoin and be thankful for what you have. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 12:54:14
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:19:20
the bottom is less than $10 and it's coming soon.
@_date: 2018-02-02 13:12:15
@_date: 2018-02-02 09:37:50
your first problem is calling real money fiat.
@_date: 2018-02-02 13:16:00
get your money out
@_date: 2018-02-02 12:46:04
this is labor theory of value, which is false.
just because i spend $8,000 making a helicopter doesn't mean it's actually worth that to anyone when it can't fly and looks stupid.
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:11:08
he's right though. bitcoin is not going back to 19k.
@_date: 2018-02-02 09:44:37
enjoy it. 
tfw nocoiner.
@_date: 2018-02-02 09:34:03
don't buy into the sunk cost fallacy, get out while you can.
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:12:11
it's not going to bounce back. the dumb money surge already happened. that energy is gone.
@_date: 2018-02-02 12:53:37
bitcoin is done. get your money out.
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:38:06
cry more
@_date: 2018-02-02 10:10:38
@_date: 2018-02-02 11:55:18
sell it today man, save your money, do something nice for yourself or your family. don't sunk cost fallacy.
