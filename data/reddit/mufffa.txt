I have found the whole wallet backup process tedious. Instead, I generated a brainwallet using [bitaddress.org](
I had a TAILs Linux USB stick and saved the web page on the stick (it works in offline mode). Generated an address using a phrase I can remember and printed out a few copies of the public and private keys for safekeeping. I have the bitcoin address bookmarked so I can send coins to cold storage as I please.
I also keep small amounts lying in my blockchain.org wallet and Mtgox - both accounts with 2 factor auth. 
I think this approach is convenient as I do not have an encrypted wallet file anywhere and don't need to memorize the encryption phrase. This also removes threats from malware/keylogger exploits. The only downside I can think is that withdrawing the coins is a bit more arduous.

Yes, but if the price of bitcoins falls, you can still sell your gear. This way you get additional financial security for your investment. ;)

I live in student housing and electricity is included in my rent :) (And I make my half of the rent by mining bitcoins, coincidentally..) :D

Good point. I was mainly talking about GPUs, but failed to mention that. Afaik, FPGA chips can be sold as they have other uses - ASICs not so much. Furthermore, FPGAs can be difficult to sell..
I bought a few used GPUs of my own just a couple of weeks ago, since I have free electricity and I had a few unused PCs laying around. I expect to get my money back selling the GPUs in a few months, or maybe I'll switch to Litecoin mining :)
