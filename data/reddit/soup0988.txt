Interesting. Might be a good time to sell some knowing it will drop then come back up

It's identical to my .0063 Bitcoin lawnmower bought last week at a yard sale

I wish I had the ability to do the same thing. Help make the world a better place while remaining anonymous

I usually buy a little every week but then buy big on the dips

Whenever we hit a new landmark I like to see a decent drop so I can buy knowing that the price will go back up real soon. 
I'd like to see 8300 again before over 10k

I agree everyone should. But worst case scenario though, should we be worried?

Your headed right way for a house and retirement. Unfortunately I got in a little late so I'll need BTC to hit about 100k for my dream to come true

But a car is much less volatile.

Ok hostile. I also can't drive myself to work or my family to go camping in my bitcoin

I use Simple Bitcoin Widget. Pretty simple and easy

Is my bitcoin safe on mycelium?
@_date: 2017-10-13 14:55:26
Thanks! I try to buy a little as often at I can
@_date: 2017-10-24 21:25:17
Elaborate?
