The problem with the Relative Strength Index, just like with all other indicators, is that it's not perfect. We are trying to predict humen (or humans? I aint no native) and they most of the time act emotionally. Most of what I learned about technical analysis i learned at the Trading212 YT. It's worth checking out :)

The Textbook knowledge is btw that, yes, when the RSI is below 30 it's oversold but also when it's above 70 it is overbought.

Here is my counterargument (Kinda):

I am sorry, but I tried to argue that right now there is no bubble poping. Thus I think we can agree on this being a dip, not a crash. :)

You sound surprisingly serious. I've done market analysis in the past and a good advice is to *not* advice people to do something. I usually just say *I* will buy/sell. Otherwise people might try yo sew you if they lost money on your advice.
Regarding the triangle you described: Yes... Markets either move up or down (if they don't stay in range). That's how they work. Kinda sounds mundane if you say it like that.
PS: You deserve all the karma in the world for making the effort to type this out.

Why'd you think DIGs are any different from the rest of the market?

I wanted to make a comment about the hype around "the bubble popping" using the relative strength index. Is that prohibited as well?

I know, I thought about taking that talent to wallstreet. Really I've dreamt all my life to be sell those motherfuckers stocks, alright? You know everybody wants to get rich and the only complaint they are gonna have is, that they don't trust you. You gotta work on that kid! We both will be rich! /s

This is a comment about the current hype around the so called bitcoin-bubble - not a price ticker.
Btw, the RSI reveals one of bitcoins great problems: It's chronically overbought.
Merry Christmas and succesful trading!

Are you guys seriously having a discussin about wether champaign is a wine or not, under a comment about bitcoin-fluctuation? :'D
@_date: 2017-12-24 18:31:17
That's kinda my point :)

I did indeed click the button that made those lines green and red. Not for those squares though. They show the slow decent of humanity into a dark future with paper money and only a spark of hope left! I used an advanced computer algorithm to calculate the mathematically perfect color composition for each bar in order of accurately depicting the slow decent of hope. /s

This is a screenshot from my personal Trading212 account.
I wanted to use the RSI to make my point and I actually have no experience using log-scales thus i don't really see your point due to lack of knowledge and cannot really write an educated answer.
@_date: 2017-12-24 21:54:46
Yeah, but what is your point? As far as I can see we argue on the same side.
@_date: 2018-09-05 17:38:47
Thanks /s
@_date: 2018-09-05 21:41:17
Quality comment right here.
Sorry that was mean. But seriously. This is just... Lazy. At least try to make a point. But thank you for boosting me up the hot ranking. Sweet sweet useless Karma.

The RSI is calculated by dividing the sum of points it moves up by the sum of points it moves down (100-100/(1-Rs), Rs being what I just showed.) Thus by the dips in the RSI you can see, that we periodically have similar dips in the relative strength.
I am sorry if I did not understand you right, but as far as I see you have no idea what you are talking about.
@_date: 2018-09-05 17:32:28
Yeah, propably. I might never truly grow up \^\^'
@_date: 2017-12-24 08:57:53
interesting point. Still - noobs will be noobs :P
Oh and because you asked - Look at the dips in the RSI

Then I shall correct myself into saying, you don't obtain physical wealth by liking ideas.

I absolutely agree, but I'm an investor. I discovered Bitcoin for the very reasons you mentioned but you don't make money off of believes.
@_date: 2018-07-02 19:56:04
Yeah kinda true :D  
I came back to Bitcoin this weekend after not touching it since december and I thought to myself: "Hm. That's convenient"
