I don't think the right word is "hurting". These corrections are healthy and just as OP said they help shake out the uneducated investors and clean up the ecosystem a bit.

I really need a comprehensive guide how to setup a node on the Mainnet. I keep finding ones for the testnet :/

Does anyone have a link to a tutorial of how to setup a lightning node/wallet on Windows?
 I wanna do that and I'm sure more people are interested. (I couldn't find the tutorial myself, so I'm asking if anyone has it bookmarked or sth :) )

Totally agree. Sad to say even in this subreddit we've began seeing "Lambros" posting about moons and "I was told there would be lambos" and shit like that. 
This here is the reality - well said man

edit: wrong link

At least with Bitcoin the growth is more or less linear, ask Uncle Roger about that with his "Scaling" solution :DD

Good question, it worries me that nobody has an adequate answer to this.

I believe they CHOSE not to go segwit. like bitcoinerrorlog said in his interview with Ver, they managed to support segwit on their platform fairly easy having a pretty small dev team so. 
It's a matter of choice, not technical limitation.

That's just dumb, if you have no solid strategy better stay out of the market. 
Don't invest what you aren't willing to lose...

That's all good and dandy, but what's the reason behind it? Low volume? Pretty stoked too, but I'd like to know the reason for the mempool emptying up :)
