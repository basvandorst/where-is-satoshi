you know the technology behind cryptocurrencies? if not, read all you can - it looks like you have that free time.  
Only put more money into bitcoin, if you like the technology AND if you think that bitcoin can successfully establish in modern world.  
and don't invest more than you can afford to lose.
I would not advise you to go all in in btc, if you do not like to work, because btc can fail, so maybe $5k-$20k more. Good luck.

If he also mined with GPUs, he will have enough money to never touch his coins from 2009 (and maybe also his coins from 2010).

is any 1bank* address blocked by this btc version?

The piece of bad news is, that if bitcoin had no value, nobody would support it (poor greedy humanity).  
The piece of good news is, that the greed will catch them all.

I think you underestimate the number of people who care about security/their money.

So then tell me what is the idea behind bitcoin? People should learn how to hold their own private keys. I do not think we need to hold IOUs, that's not the meaning of this huge network.

but is it not better to have anonymity on protocol level (if possible)?

hey, but please regard that the $ price of bitcoin can go down (and/or up). bitcoin is really good to send to other people, but it's also very volatile.

All scenarios can be handled. Bitcoin will not die, but it could be always a niche product if they try it hard enough.

They will learn, that a bank is not a safe haven.  
I also do not understand why a bank should be safe from bankrupting.  
I would love to see a bank without speculation, which only act as money transfer service for monthly fees.

I also have fear that the proposed blocksize is too big. Im running 3 nodes and I think that I will shut them down if the hardfork will come.

had any government a surplus on the end of the year?

what are the odds of deanonymization when I create a tx chain with a lenght of 10 and mixin 4 in monero? will it get harder?

he can hedge without the fee and it's not a nice way, but I would not call it a scam.

darkcoin has probably not the best implementation of anonymity. i don't know if the masternode workaround is effective enough against governments (if you think otherwise, please explain me why, i'm very interested in this topic). i think the cn coins will have a better chance in suvh a scenario.
@_date: 2015-02-22 23:47:22
can anybody explain me, how they know all theses addresses? or are they all suspect addresses?
@_date: 2015-03-14 04:10:02
isn't it possible that anybody could get an random address which 5 first bits start with '1dice'?
@_date: 2015-02-19 14:57:32
probably not the smartest idea
@_date: 2015-02-24 23:18:09
pretty sure government prevents HSBC from money laundering... oh wait.  
corporations do sometimes illegal things (but I don't say that coinbase does it).

your withdraw address gets tracked from every legal exchange. i also think that databases like described from OP exist today.
