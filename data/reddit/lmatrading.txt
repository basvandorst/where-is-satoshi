PEOPLE SHOULD BE PROTECTED??? 
So everything should be centralized and we ask permission. STFU back to the FIATLAND and stay there until u grow a brain. 
Bit harsh but true.

All mixing services are pretty useless, how can't they be? 
Put the coin in the mixer it does what it does, comes out the other side "clean".
Lets say Feds get hold of all the transactions then link addresses to your exchange account. 
GAME OVER.
