Hey, Glad you liked that post.
Not any of the bank you mentioned.
Contact me on telegram to find out more.

What's the advantage of cashing out to a private bank over a normal bank? 


On top of that the banks I work with have been educated to crypto already and are crypto friendly, so the onboarding is shorter.
@_date: 2018-01-08 16:43:12
if your crypto wealth is over 500k to cash out, would definitely advise PB set up.
Yes they might freeze and force you to a kyc, only you would'nt face someone knowledgeable so it will take time.

No. I have to say Monero adopters are faithful to the philosophy of their coins and they don't seek actively Private banking onboarding.
Banks themselves don't want to hear about monero holders.
I had one legit case where the owner sat at the table and eventually agreed to give his public view keys, and we were able to open his account.

UBS, Julius Bär, Pictet are the few banks that can help you with your situation. However you will have to pay capital gains to the IRS indeed.

It should'nt be too hard to check whether it was from mining by the way. Just a bit of digging around the original addresses is necessary. And remember we don't need to corroborate everything to have your miner profile validated.

thanks !
Oh just read your username.
I see what you did there ;)
@_date: 2017-12-31 13:11:42
we actually help structure investments through tailor made SPVs and certificates to accumulate the coupons and dividends and have them accrued to the nav as capital gains.
Way more efficient and less costly than ETFs or index funds.
@_date: 2017-12-24 16:43:09
good point.
A bit similar to me by the way.
I got a huge portion of my crypto stack over the years by helping newbies trade and secure their crypto under the table and taking commissions in crypto in exchange of this service.
It is very difficult in that case...sort of nightmarish situation.

Hey mate. if this new post was not informative enough, I really don't know what more I can do. 
Porto Rico is the only place in the world where US person can get tax exemption. When you apply for the decree, it is retroactive the first day you set foot on the Island. You can set up a B corporation, create a social entrepreneurship as a microlending bank for the island. there are many creative ways to do it. read the pwc paper as a start.
My expertise is not around US banks. Only licensed Swiss Private banks who have the right to deal with US citizen. Again, I am not in the tax evasion business, but I do have the ability to operate a cash out legally if you are tax compliant. There are not many other tricks for the US citizen unfortunately.
The horror stories are for real I am telling you.
People reveal info if they want to cash out. I keep the info confidential. It's not free help. I do charge. I take a risk for every case I work on because if I onboard a bad guy, my business can be shut down by regulators.
Unfortunately, don't expect you can cash out without disclosing info to the bank where you will be deposited.
@_date: 2017-12-25 10:25:53
the strict minimum is somewhere between $500k and 1m

I am trying my best to build this "pipeline to fiat without a freeze."
I have done it in the past.
This post was written to highlight it is not easy, and to set forth the needed steps.
@_date: 2017-12-24 15:09:38
True, but if your official residence is Dubaï, and you have a resident card there, and do not spend more than 6 months in Germany per year, you are all set.
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:40:31
Same as for Switzerland.
We have a relationship with BNP Luxembourg for our traditional clients
Never cashed out anyone there as I focused on my banking relation locally regarding crypto clients, but we could give it a try if it is important for you.
@_date: 2014-01-17 09:23:23
why don't you crowdfund the project by premining a small portion of the future altcoin and auction them ?
It favors early adopter and help you fund the project
@_date: 2014-09-08 08:17:24
Withdraw 10 BTC. 
Wait til it goes to the moon.
Buy the whole city.

Sorry to be that guy, but technically speaking, this would be an ETN.
@_date: 2018-10-15 06:51:02
This is BTC bull.
every other guy holding tether will have to buy BTC to hedge !!! BTC going up will take the rest of the market with it. that's short term.
long term, it looks bad

If you are not a US person, setting up a Swiss bank account is easy for accounts over $200k. just sayin'
@_date: 2018-03-09 15:29:10
well, obviously you have never asked Genesis if they would settle a 40k btc trade.
short answer, they won't. I had such a seller with kyc, they never found me a corresponding buyer.
@_date: 2018-02-22 08:32:39
would be glad to talk you through the process and help you.
Do you mind contacting me on telegram ? 
@_date: 2018-02-27 08:59:02
absolutely. they might freeze.
@_date: 2018-02-22 08:35:19
bitstamp kraken for tranches below 100k  
Cumberland, Genesis, between 100k and 5m  
Altcoinomy for tranches above 5m  
@_date: 2015-09-08 15:52:59
I have already built a trading platform based on Esper and TA-lib. UI is online. I can show you over skype.
The database is redis-based &amp; integration with R has been done for more complex calculation/model.
Which broker do you have in mind ?
Please specify by PM the equity distribution, and your budget for futher development.
@_date: 2017-05-30 17:22:18


I know what you feel. I would like myself that BTC balances appear on current accounts, same way private banks currently report XAU. 
Hopefully the 2nd wave adoption will come soon, but it might takes years.
@_date: 2017-05-30 16:09:13
so yes, typically in Singapour, Monaco or Switzerland, you can claim for a special fiscal status after being granted residency, and in this case capital gains are not taxed in these countries. more in pm. sorry this is sensitive.
also depends if you ever declared your coins to German fiscal authorities or not.

a 20k deposit is not an issue compliance wise. 
Hundreds of 20k deposits will get your account frozen.
If the bank is aware of what's going on, and has validated your account, it is no more a problem.
@_date: 2017-05-30 15:16:50
no, I only recommend structuring because you don't want to trade all your bitcoin at once. It would mean putting them at risk on the exchange and maybe weighting on the price if it is too big an amount.
parceling the transaction is safer. it is not to avoid scrutiny since the bank has already validated your account and they know it will take days before all the wires hit the account. Everyone is compliant in this case, and everyone is aware of the process
@_date: 2018-04-24 13:25:34
I sure can help you.

If you want to move out from the bitcoin ecosystem into fiat, first you need a bank account, and make sure the bank won't freeze your account everytime you deposit $20k. My post is a warning that opening a Private bank account is not that simple.
To cash out, do it partially, on a daily basis. Open an account at coinbase, kraken and bitstamp, and get rid of 20BTC on each platform every day, so that you have most in cold storage during the process.
@_date: 2017-05-30 15:15:18
you are absolutely correct. Some Swiss banks accept US citizen, but not most of them, and in any case the individual has to be tax compliant. My post is definitely not an incentive for tax avoidance.
