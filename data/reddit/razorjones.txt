Ok this stuff is starting to get real. What else can we do here? Could bitcoins held in the voting pool also be linked to a derivative on say bitmex (maybe with the pool holding the cyrptographic API key)? 
Would this allow the hallowed bitcoin held at x/currency's value also. (Note bitmex also has tor connections so all this could be done in secret).
Wow, have been following open transactions for some time but this is epic, looks like they cracked a big one here

Ok, yea, wait and see is a good mantra. More tools in place now, like the bitmex derivatives - this may change the setting no?

So how do I get the coins from mytrezor to electrum, start electrum with my seed?
@_date: 2015-10-04 16:14:29
Ok, that worked, tried to send out the funds though and no its showing nothing and the transaction inputs show nothing.

Fuck, its the trezor standard client, mytrezor Not much I can do about it. Have I lost these coins? Have I lost anything else on the device?
Can I resent everything to get it off the device?
