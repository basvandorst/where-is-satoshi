What fiat currency do you have?
@_date: 2018-05-26 20:41:15
No. What government backed currency do you have. What is the currency you use at the moment? Dollars? Euros? Pounds?
@_date: 2019-03-18 08:47:25

I would like, buy now like. You will like, end up like, never getting a position like, if you like wait for ever like.
@_date: 2019-03-17 08:31:20
Because I have the Fiat to double down and I'm looking for the best entry. Theory dictates that we need to test the 4 year cycle low again. But, this rally has been STRONG, this is why I'm concerned. I'm not buying above 3600. 
@_date: 2019-03-17 07:46:49
I see the irony yes. But when you put your entire future and plan for the next 4 years into something, would you not want to guage sentiment with those around you?
We're mid cycle with another lower high (so far), time is running out for the bulls. Despite this logic and other indicators, I am still susceptible to my own emotions. 
@_date: 2019-03-13 22:10:12
Average Joe doesn't get it yet. He will. 
@_date: 2019-03-03 18:57:11
Yes! I think Bitcoin should be shown in Satoshi by default. Dollar &amp; Cent. Bitcoin &amp; Sat. 
@_date: 2019-03-18 08:42:54
Smart money, right here. 
@_date: 2019-08-29 07:04:17
Forflies is the worst of them. One massive scam. He wins about 10% of his trades. Its laughable. He charges thousands to find this out.

Yes, I know.

Why? The banking for Coinbase in Europe is based in London (UK) and I don't have to go across a border to use the banking, nothing will change for me...
@_date: 2019-08-22 09:26:45
Brilliant. Keep the information coming. This avalanche is only getting started!
@_date: 2019-08-25 07:41:58
There's already more than 21 million. They call it futures. Paper bitcoin used to suppress the market. The traditional banking system do what they want.
@_date: 2019-08-29 06:43:42
This is a bull market. I survived 2018, the markets ready.
@_date: 2019-08-25 14:05:21
Smart. Thank you for explaining that to me. I need to get more Bitcoin...
@_date: 2019-08-30 20:01:52
You mean the plebs. Most of us Brits are respectable people.
@_date: 2019-08-30 20:04:22
You won't find anyone who will sell that much at the beginning of a bull market. The ships sailed, just market buy and take the price to the moon...
@_date: 2019-10-11 19:21:43
Bitcoin. Litecoin will consolidate for a while now. Bitcoin is the market leader for now.
@_date: 2019-08-28 06:51:52
Is it? I've been trading market tops and bottoms very well for years. Learn time cycles. TA based solely on price is a waste of time. But with TA based on time, you're onto something.
J. M. Hurst, Walter Bressert and Bob Loukas didn't become multi millionaires through dumb luck. Market timing is everything. You won't find wealth if you follow YouTubers like Forflies or some other scammer; who only wins trades 10% of the time.

@_date: 2019-08-25 13:43:23
Paper gold seems to be a thing.
@_date: 2019-08-30 19:49:35
I didn't get one. I'm in the UK. Maybe it's because the banking is based in London and it wouldn't matter for me?
@_date: 2019-08-31 09:12:22
Bitcoin is more regarded as a store of value now. If you want an actual currency, we're years away from that. When blockchains can scale, then buy that blockchain if you want a currency.

I ended up buying at 5600 ��
@_date: 2019-02-01 07:19:57
Exactly. It's not ready. 
@_date: 2019-08-30 20:29:15
Lower tax yes, but also because Europe banks in London. New York, London &amp; Tokyo are the financial centres of the world. Somethings will never change...
@_date: 2019-10-22 19:34:29
It's a book store. Aha!
@_date: 2019-02-01 06:59:51
Well yeah. Its still a speculative asset. It's not ready for real world use, yet.

Stop spreading FUD. You drew the lower trend line with the candle bodies and the upper line with the wicks. 
Your trend lines are drawn to suit your bias. It's wicks or bodies, not both...

6,200 is the max retracement now. Buy there if I were you. I made back the difference on the entry price trading. Happy with my allocation on this first wave.
@_date: 2019-02-14 07:55:48
Already have! I've used an exchange with low liquidity as well, so I can catch a crazy wick. ��
@_date: 2019-02-09 16:20:34
Your TA theory is wrong. Don't mislead people. If you drew those trend lines properly; there is still room to move before a rejection. The upper trend line is at 3800 if you use candle bodies, higher if you use the wicks.
@_date: 2019-02-01 14:34:23
Sooo many people I've talked to about Bitcoin that don't own it or know about it have said this: 'Isn't it $3000 for one?'. They don't understand it can be split. They see it as a single unit. It's only because we've gone down the rabbit hole that we understand this. 
With regards to Satoshis, I'm speculating, so I bought one. I'm talking about actual real world use for buying things. 
@_date: 2019-02-01 15:17:10
Awesome! What have you bought with Bitcoin? I've never found anywhere that takes it as payment. 
@_date: 2019-02-01 08:23:44
Yeah, but it's not ready for real world use. Only once the lightning network is fully adopted and the format of account is changed from decimal to Satoshi will it be ready.
Does average Joe really want to/understand that his milk now cost's 0.00000001. No. Does average Joe also want to wait around for 30 minutes for his transaction to go through. No. When these issues are solved I'll stop speculating. 
@_date: 2019-02-14 07:59:04
I've got my buys on Kraken. It has massive wicks on price. Especially if you're not trading in usd! Come load the boat with me?! 
@_date: 2019-02-01 18:43:47
Thanks! I hear Fidelity are launching a platform as well as Bakkt. Etf is cool. However, do we need all of this? Can't we just have another retail bull market? 
@_date: 2019-02-01 10:43:42
Thanks! I reset both of them before I used them as well.
I read about the guy who had his seed created before he got the ledger and lost it all! My seed is in a separate location to my wallet too. ��
@_date: 2019-02-21 06:46:51
Wow. That's intrusive. Send them some sympathy Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2019-06-19 16:50:14
I will hack this into the ground. Who's with me?!
@_date: 2019-06-22 06:26:22
I went in with half my fiat. Still have the other half for a pull back. If that ever happens...
@_date: 2019-02-14 12:03:05
Maybe. However, if buyers are accumulating, then why is the price going down? Volume precedes price.

@_date: 2019-02-01 10:18:10
I agree. However, when new investors look at Bitcoin. They think 'I can't afford it'. Because from the outsider they see it as a single unit. Not something that can be split. 
Wallets might give you the option of viewing satoshi. The exchanges and community need to change the way its displayed to others. 
@_date: 2019-04-09 19:36:29
I got the same message! What a scam.
@_date: 2019-04-26 14:18:45
Buy the dip? There aren't many weak hands left...
@_date: 2019-04-27 09:24:32
Sell-offs just don't bother me anymore. It just gives us an opportunity to buy more from weak hands... 
Time is running out. We need to focus less on price and more on time. 3 years from now we're going to be in a completely different price range. A range that will reward those who hold strong throughout all the FUD and manipulation.
@_date: 2019-04-24 09:35:54
Me too! However, I just bought and I think I caused the price to crash. Sorry everyone!
@_date: 2019-09-17 06:36:58
Resistance is Futile.

Oh great, another teenager who thinks he knows how to trade. Bravo.

The order book doesn't matter. Volume matters. Also if we are using the order book, its empty until 9k.
@_date: 2019-09-29 09:13:04
45% off the top. A generational opportunity to buy Bitcoin and you're worried about 8%? Pull THE TRIGGER.
You only win or lose when you sell.
@_date: 2019-09-01 17:43:49
Aha! This is hilarious. Yeah, I've got an indicator too. It's called heikin ashi. I could teach you a thing or two.
@_date: 2019-09-20 20:47:52

I'm calling a 77-80% Bitcoin dominance cycle top by 03/11/19. Market cycles timing doesn't change. Looking forward to Bitcoin dominance euphoria. That's when I'll be buying large caps for the first time in 4 years.
@_date: 2019-09-08 05:20:43
This is the 2nd wave of 5. The 2nd wave is a retracement wave. Wave 1 proved the intention of this market. Buying at any point until this short term downtrend is complete, is a gift. Don't throw this opportunity away for a few percent difference.
I've been waiting 2 years for this moment. The market has shown its hand and confirmed the beginning of a bull market. The speed and size of the 1st wave indicates something spectacular for those who can HODL through to 2021 end.
Put your emotions in the bin. 2018 was a time to consolidate your position/wait. The timing is right, do not lose your position.

@_date: 2018-04-25 07:12:59
Aha! If people sell in fear of articles like this. I'll just buy the dip... 
@_date: 2018-04-12 18:44:33
Maybe George Soros is dipping his toe in? That reptile broke the Pound in 1992. I hope he buys rather then shorts. He went up against one of the most valuable currencies in the world and made $1billion shorting it!

Aha! That would be foolish. I just invest what I can. Do you like the financial system we have? Crooked bankers bringing down the economy and after getting the bail out money, paying themselves bonuses for screwing the world over... Oh yeah! Lets also not forget the times they were caught laundering drug money and funding for terrorism.

@_date: 2019-05-20 16:25:17
No. No lower than 5500. If the price goes higher before a sell off, this number will rise.
@_date: 2019-05-20 15:57:54
Technical Analysis. Get on trading view, learn how to draw it on the Bitcoin chart. That is your Iron support for the next 2 years. Buy it there everytime. Draw it inverse when the price is in a downtrend (2018). Print your own money for life. Good luck!
@_date: 2019-05-20 16:37:18
Better find a buyer. The cycle low is due in the next 30 days. If not before...

Bitcoin likes to trade from one extreme to the other. 6-3k was the top to the bottom of the current pitchfork channel (pitchfork drawn from 2015 low - 2017 high). As time progresses price moves up the channels. The top of the channel is currently 8.9k. If the weekly candle closes above this level the next stop is 16k! (the next channel top).
All these TA boys on YouTube over complicate trading. Keep it simple. The micro trend had been up since February 4th. The 0.618 Fibonacci was broken early March. From this point it was very clear the macro trend had changed.
Anyone calling for lower lows is delusional. I'm long from 3,900. Until the trend changes (weekly RSI 5 crossing RSI 14). I'll be buying the dip. You all should too.
@_date: 2019-05-25 21:47:47
Hello. It's always a good time to invest in Bitcoin. However, markets need to go down as well as up. We've had a great 2 months of price increases, but a healthy dip in price is due soon. That being said, short term price movements should not effect your investment decisions. Long term, Bitcoin is a great investment in the future of money. We're at the beginning of what could be another 3 years of upside price movement.
I've personally never had any problems with Coinbase and it is really the only safe gateway into the crypto space that I know of. That being said, buy a decent book on Bitcoin and understand what it is first. I would recommend 'Cryptocurrency: The Future Of Money?' by Paul Vigna &amp; Michael J. Casey. Although a little out of date, it sets the foundation of what money is and the origins of Bitcoin.
Good luck!  
@_date: 2019-05-11 14:24:17
I hope so. I said that we would see 4,000 again when the price hit 5600 (when I bought) and fell 10%. Now we're just shy of 7k.
@_date: 2019-05-11 13:57:34
Hey, thanks for the comment. What I don't quite understand is why would market makers drop the price down, to only swing it back up at the blink of an eye. How's that going to encourage people to buy and HODL? I believe in Bitcoin, but I don't believe in how the market is so heavily manipulated.
The break of 6,000 was just a massive bear trap. Now I'm struggling to buy back in. How does that help adoption?
@_date: 2019-05-11 14:15:58
Thanks again. The good thing is, whenever I buy, the price drops. So maybe if I just buy a small amount and wait to buy after then I might be successful this time.
@_date: 2019-05-20 15:43:05
Look for a 0.618 retracement. Then you'll know. This is also how I knew the trend changed below 4k. When the 0.618 didn't resist the price anymore.
@_date: 2019-05-14 09:21:19
My hairdresser is not talking about Bitcoin yet. Bull market confirmed.
@_date: 2019-05-11 00:14:20

@_date: 2019-05-11 14:43:37

Things have only just got started. Where's the 0.618 bounce. I have a wall down there. Come sit on my wall bears.
@_date: 2019-05-20 19:04:49
Yes. But don't just take my word for it:
