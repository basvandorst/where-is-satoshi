i used coinbase when I first bought my btc. I got confirmed within a day. I also contacted support about my btc not showing up, and they replied within a few days as well. 
this was right as it hit $10k though, so I guess I just got lucky? luckily I didn't lose out on anything. I think I'll just hodl and forget about it for right now.

I sure hope you're right. I bought $50 right around when it hit $10k, so I'm perfectly okay with the whole thing tanking if/when that happens, then I'll invest a little more. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:44:38
I'll hold you to that.

I've thought about doing something like this for years.
obviously it's not possible, but still
@_date: 2017-12-30 20:02:58
I thought you weren't required to report something if you made under $600 or something. or is that for the entire year?
@_date: 2017-12-27 03:22:45
that's my plan tbh. I only have like $70 worth

interesting. while moving to a new island may not be impossible per se, the near utopia that's completely unaffected by current society I imagine will me impossible to achieve. 
eventually, there will be some other country that decides to fuck with it. there has always been international conflict, and there always will be. 
my only solution would be to move to an island on an uninhabited version of earth in a parallel universe. 
now *that* is impossible

you've been a redditor for four years and didn't know about this...?
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:24:21
I wonder if I'll even be using reddit at that time
@_date: 2017-12-18 17:35:10
you fuck

half a bitcoin is quite a bit. I'm over with .0049 or something. I think I bought right as it hit $10k for the first time
@_date: 2018-08-02 17:23:20
free money lmao
@_date: 2017-12-18 16:23:22
not bitcoins specifically, just an island away from current society
@_date: 2018-06-11 19:29:45
yup, that's the plan. 
@_date: 2018-06-10 01:15:27
what unit of length would be equivalent to one satoshi? or are we talking area/volume here?
@_date: 2018-06-11 05:45:40
I have 5 mBTC that I bought when it first hit $10k. I would love to use it as a normal currency, but it hasn't been adopted at the places I usually spend money at. not only that, but I'm a student without a steady income, so it's not like I can consistently buy more even if I did spend it. 
but that's just my story.

@_date: 2017-11-30 16:04:49
I'm very well aware I'll lose the $50 I invested. really I just bought some for shits and giggles. 
@_date: 2018-03-17 19:59:08
I still think it's cool to know
@_date: 2018-02-27 16:09:46
they're going straight to 20? I would've thought they'd go to 11, like when they went from 970 to 1070

it's at the top if you've updated the app
@_date: 2018-02-28 13:48:00
I believe you can only upgrade one or two components at a time
@_date: 2018-02-28 13:49:31
install word using wine

see, you have to have a pretty high IQ to understand...
@_date: 2018-02-28 13:49:12
you can do basically all of that already except your game library is more restricted. but you do you man. use whatever works

I feel like it'd be better to design a new hardware product specifically for mining, just how the GPU was created specifically for graphics (originally known as a "hardware accelerator")
but I'm just some dude on the internet, so what do I know
@_date: 2018-02-12 15:15:40
I thought a satoshi was the smallest unit? is that no longer the case?
@_date: 2018-04-16 19:42:59
you should add garlicoin!
