It's more satire than actually speculation.  Does commenting on this send my concerns to the mod?

With all this China crap going on and the price dropping insanely. One thing is certain prices will rebound higher than ever. It may take a year or a month hell one good week and the last month of loses could be forgotten. I'm going to say something crazy but hang in there with me. 
No one buy. Let those prices drop and drop for the next week or so. Get those prices down to the triple digits. One btc is down so say $600 per coin then buy in heavy and quick. 
And I'm not only saying this because I have a $600 refund check coming that I can't cash in for a week.

Another question just for women is " have you had sexual encounter with a man who may have had an encounter with another man?" Plus my new tattoo was a bigger issue to the clerk.

Either way it would bring attention to BTC and up the price.

Hopefully you'll never need a bank account and a Bitcoin wallet is all you'll ever need.

That's not fair. I got $60 plus $10 extra as a student for 3 weeks then $50 - $40 - and finally $25 from then on.  Then I fuck one dude and I can't donate no more plasma.

Bi.  When you donate they make you fill out a questionnaire everytime and that's one of the questions. Same with blood donations.

Why don't you go set up an escrow based system of BTC
