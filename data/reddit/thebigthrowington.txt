I use bitcoin core and all it says is a recommended amount or custom of a btc value per kilobyte

Of course the price dropped and is now rising again.. Eveyy body wishes they did but you lose out over time because we can't tell the future.

So I don't have to make a new thread once u send ur funds to a trezor device and u wanted to sell ur btc like a fool how long would it take and is it straight forward?

How many times does it have to repeat itself before people actually realise. But instead they think no this time is different its crashed, its dead. If ur in it for short term it won't work or be potential big regrets.

Only you can decide. If you lost that 10k would it affect ur life? If so don't do it invest a smaller amount as people have said. Definitely ignore the people who say just do it they don't know ur personal life.

I imagine so with some people, but I think some people are just in it for a bit of profit in the short term I only figure that from last night for example with people saying they are selling when it hit 10.8k £. Might cause people to panic but i believe it going up over time and people will probably regret it like the previous times and wish they'd stayed in. But everybody's personal lives are their own circumstances. I'd only consider selling a portion when it means I can buy another house to rent out because that's life changing to me in the fact I'd have 2 rental properties and wouldn't have to work much or if it at all if I chose not to.

Cheers im verified on coinbase and had no problems and bought through coinbase and coinbase Pro just read a few comments about being getting their accounts frozen whilst checking the bitcoins. I have no intention of selling anytime soon but good to know for emergencys etc

U can't afford to lose any more money so no.
@_date: 2019-06-27 11:21:00
Cheers! I'm not the best at explaining

Can't tax me if I HODL to the grave!
But on a serious note seen people mention about after a year it becomes a long term tax gain or something is that an American thing?
@_date: 2019-06-25 11:43:06
Only you can answer that. It's a risk never invest anything more than you can afford to lose. If that 6k is gonna affect ur life then no. Also people willl tell you to never invest in anything you don't understand. I personally believe BTC is a big thing.
