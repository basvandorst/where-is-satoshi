Was looking at my blockchain wallet. They recommended to transfer to the blockchain specific wallet, so I did it, and now everything is down. 
Just wondering if anyone else is having this issue. Kinda sweating a bit here!

you're original comment seems to go against that.
if you want good, reliable content, you have to pay for it.  you get what you pay for.
Newsweek, as a publication and a business, has more of a responsibility to get it "correct" than a no name who can disappear at any time.
Sure, you can argue they're trying to make money, but that's what you have to freaking do to provide high quality content.
This generation of people who grew up pirating shit, not paying for anything, expecting the highest quality stuff without paying for an ounce of it is so prevalent, it's not even really stereotype anymore.  Can't have your cake and eat it too.
Also, who says this is a lie?

Let's be realistic here.  going from $60 to $120+ in a couple weeks is sky rocketing.  You'd be hard pressed to find ANY sort of security jumping at that price, especially something that has hundreds of millions in market cap
