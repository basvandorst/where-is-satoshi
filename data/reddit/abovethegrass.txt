Probably the most important part of making backups is *testing* backups. Assume an untested backup won't work. And when you test, test from the worst failure scenario you want your backups to protect against. 
You don't want to have 8 sets of redundant backups, only to discover when your hard drive dives that you made a mistake in your encryption and your backups are all unrecoverable and useless. Test early, test often, never rely on a backup that hasn't been thoroughly and *cruelly* tested.

I assume you're using Bitcoin-QT?
If you use [Electrum]( you don't have to synchronize with the network.

If you're serious and the amount of BTC involved is substantial, you should:
* immediately disconnect the hard drive the data is stored on
* make an exact copy of all volumes on the drive using [dd]( If you don't know how to do this or don't feel 100% comfortable doing it, hire a **trusted** professional to do it for you
* only make recovery attempts on the copied drives, or copies of the copied drive
If you don't, there's a decent chance you might accidentally delete or overwrite the very data you're trying to recover. Will post more in a minute.
To get more help trying to recover the data, you need to describe exactly what you did to create the encrypted volume and what you moved there. You should state the software you used and all the steps you remember taking.
Can you find the wallet.dat file? Is the problem that you can't use the file with a bitcoin program, or that the wallet.dat file loads properly but shows an empty balance?

Obviously you know yourself better than anyone else here but almost everything about your story would indicate this statement is not true, or at least not true in the context you have presented it. If I were you I would consider taking some of the comments people have left more seriously.
