This is already reality, in Germany at least:

Of course those pizzas can’t be compared with regular ones from a pizzeria but still pizza is pizza ��

@_date: 2017-12-15 00:02:34
I’ve asked their CEO in their telegram group and he answered that they’re currently waiting on the schnorr implementations from core, that’s the reason why they take so long. Q1 2018 is the eta he then concluded.

@_date: 2017-08-15 17:55:05
Thanks, I found it. So a paper wallet can only store the key that grants acces to the btc but not directly send/spend them, right? How would a hacker then get acces to my btc when he gets acces to the key? Just by typing in the key to his wallet software?

I meant the science as a whole but crypto-currencies are definitely one of the many benefits it provides. "Bitcoin" just happened to be the first one but the name itself is pretty clever if you think about it.

ignore that comment, as I recently learned you can wipe your wallet and then deinstall bread (after saving the recovery phrase) from your phone so your keys can't get into the hands of a hacker anymore, doing that turns it basically into a cold wallet

@_date: 2017-08-15 11:18:01
If you wrote down the seed phrase and then delete the wallet it's essentially a paper wallet. The problem I have with breadwallet is that the seed can be seen from inside the wallet as long as you re-enter the passcode, therefore one could say that breadwallet is "only" as safe as your phone. I think they should change the seed tab so that it can only be viewed 1x to write it down and that's it. Plus they still need to implement a 2FA...
*btw I do use bread on my iPhone.
@_date: 2017-08-14 18:50:27
brilliant 
@_date: 2017-08-15 15:54:08
Could you perhaps provide a little guide on how to safely create a paper wallet? I would like to try it out but every time I read about them, the first thing people mention is a "new computer" to offline print the keys...seems a bit too paranoid for me.

If anything comes out of it, you can expect a similar cash-out feature like with the bch fork on August 1st.
@_date: 2017-10-23 10:00:12
The actual function can be found under the advanced settings in the UI. Once opened, one has to type in an address which supports the bch balance that will then be transmitted.
@_date: 2017-10-24 19:13:37
Will do, thanks!

@_date: 2017-10-23 09:51:23
If one had any btc (0,01 or a full coin) in their breadwallet prior to the 1st of August, it got automatically split into the equivalent amount of bch. Two weeks after the fork, bread implemented a feature which let users claim their splitted bch.
That feature can still be used to this day but as far as I know bread plans on adding full bch support to the wallet.
@_date: 2017-10-09 18:42:08
the world is bigger than good ol ‚merica you know 
@_date: 2017-10-31 16:59:14
Sure but only after some time has passed, if you check the market behavior and buy after a correction the price will be faster in the green ;-)
@_date: 2018-02-25 12:06:12
Haha still props for that sentence ^^ horoscho ;-)
@_date: 2017-10-30 12:14:23
The correction everyone’s waiting for will take place shortly before/after the b2x fork in November.
@_date: 2017-10-30 12:11:57
Just do what you gotta do but don’t get mad afterwards.

@_date: 2017-10-25 00:09:02
I think that the blockchain technology will revolutionize the global monetary approach as far as the internet did with the global communication approach!

Stranger things and it remake afaik
@_date: 2018-04-21 07:14:02
Just wanted to mention that if you find the seed phrase, you could just wipe the wallet from his phone and delete the bread app itself so it becomes a cold wallet.
May your brother rest in peace and great memory.

You've got time until tomorrow, then you should hold your coin.
@_date: 2017-07-29 16:06:18
It's not. The devs already stated that they will support a bcc wallet if the users will demand it enough.
@_date: 2017-07-16 12:26:03
Because information on paper is safer than on hardware (if the paper is guarded well).
