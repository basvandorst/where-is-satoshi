No, i meant the black dots in the diagram. I think it's the delta between real BTC price and calculated price according to the S2F model.
edit: just found out myself: 
S2F multiple = BTC price / S2F model value

Thanks! I actually meant "threat" but I misspelled it... :-/
"Left translated cycle" were the words I was looking for. So he is saying that the top could be shifted to the left in future cycles.

At minute 10:57 - what is the thread called? I didn't get it (English is not my first language). Is he talking about a possible front-running?

How is the S2F multiple calculated?

What‘s the title of the documentary you are talking about? I‘d like to watch it.

I see you are also using TOR. Did you try to connect your Raspiblitz to Zap mobile wallet? For me it didn‘t work :(
@_date: 2019-03-05 05:17:49
You can also activate TOR on the Raspiblitz. Then you don’t have to deal with port forwarding.

No, the randomly assigned tags in Austria have numbers first and then letters. Vanity plates have letters first and numbers at the end.

Interesting Podcast episode about immersion cooling: 
They use a fluid called Bitcool.

You could also buy stocks from Bitcoin mining company “Hut 8 Mining” to get some ₿ exposure.

I thought they discounted it because of declining demand due to the bear market.

Due to a request here the detailed procedure:
Log in to the Raspiblitz and select "X   Console / Terminal"
    sudo nano /etc/tor/torrc
and modify the torrc configfile by adding
    ExitRelay 0
    ExitPolicy reject *:*
Exit nano with "Ctrl-X" and confirm with "Y" to save the file.
Now type
    sudo reboot
to restart the Raspiblitz

You‘re absolutely right! At derstandard.at it‘s very bad but even at technology news sites like futurezone.at they have mainly negative articles lately (ransomware, darkweb,...) They didn‘t even mention Bitcoin‘s 10th birthday on January 3rd.
@_date: 2019-01-15 08:15:20
Yes, it works. I also added ExitRelay 0 just to be sure.
@_date: 2019-01-07 19:58:58
I used those instructions too. But my concern is that after activating TOR my Raspi also acts as a tor exit node. After doing some research i found that if you don't want to be an exit node you need to add
    ExitPolicy reject *:*
in the torrc file. This line is missing. So can I just add it and be sure nobody is using my home internet connection through TOR for any illegal stuff?

Reminds me of the "cat carrier":

Bought BTC and also sold BTC for Amazon.de vouchers multiple times.
I use bitpanda since late summer 2017. No problems yet.

Can you recommend a good book on this topic?

Thanks! I also found a typo in (3): ‘ony‘
