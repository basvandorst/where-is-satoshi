In the very beginning, BTC as such was regarded as a possible replacement of fiat currency. Nevertheless, its deflative nature (and the fact it gained reputation similar to currently viewed gold - not a mean of payment but store of value class of the asset) turned it into a digital gold, not a mean of payment. As well the volatility itself is a problem for using it as a huge scale of payment.
A good example can be presented using the shipyard industry. In that industry, you make orders for ships in few years in advance (and ordering party is paying by installments in accordance with the contract). In this case, if a value of currency changes even by several percent in couple of years - this can put a shipyard in a financial crisis. 
Now, check the volatility of BTC during last 7 days. On some moments it was up to 20% per day.

And on Friday,  FED Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said  during an official  hearing (under a pledge) that BTC belongs to the same category as a gold  - store of value. 
Doublethinking, eh?

Sometimes a single candle can cause panic in the market. Especially in periods where there is relatively low trading volume and we are trading sideways

Yup, it might be thrown away by someone unaware that the true value of a piece of paper is worth $1 000 000

Nope, it was a single 10000 BTC sell order on Bitfinex

Such corrections are actually a great opportunity for investors during  the bull market.
