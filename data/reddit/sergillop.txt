What I don't understand is this: bitcoin does not need to have a high value to be useful, right? So why does it have to go up? I mean a bitcoin could be 1 euro or 1 dollar and be used all over the world, even more easily than if it was lets say 100.000€ (no need for so many decimals in small transactions).

There is a clear patter or reversal with a strong possibility of stability, unless it goes down.

It's false.

Maybe one thing is not related to the other.

That makes sense, thank you :)

I bought 1 imaginary bitcoin at 9,270, difference today, around +1,000 USD in 4 days. I'm using a very simple indicator (EMA 14) and will follow buy and sell warnings from it. Will post how it goes for my imaginary bitcoin.
14/2/2018: bought imaginary 1btc  at 9,270 usd
18/2/2018: +1,000 usd (aprox, conservative)
warning from EMA14: hodl
Disclaimer: I know MA in general will suck for many of you, it's just an experiment.

But you will always buy what you need. If I want to buy a 1000$ computer with bitcoins at 1$/bitcoin i will buy 1000 btc and that can make it go up to 2$/bitcoins, so the next costumer will need only 500 btc, It seems it tends to stabilize, at some point you need just 0,1 btc for that computer and that makes no difference in the btc value.

Which one is going to be gentlemen, the green line or the red line? 
Will we see how deep the rabbit hole goes? Or bitcoin will be a shooting star leaping through the sky?
