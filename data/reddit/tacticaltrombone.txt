I'll send you my address if you want to put a few BTC towards a retainer :)
How are you going to prove damages?  There are so many variables going into the price, that connecting a drop in the exchange price at a certain point to a specific article is going to be impossible.  And what if there are multiple articles from multiple sources?  and how are you going to allocate damages between multiple news agencies reporting the same thing?
and then, what if BTC goes up again a week later?  are you going to try to prove that the market would have been higher but for the news reporting?  remember, you have to be able to prove your set of facts "more likely than not".  Good luck convincing a judge or jury that a price drop is more likely than not caused by a specific news article.
but, I'm happy to send a few nasty letters :)

Every decision you make has possible results and consequences.  When you make a decision whose consequences are out of your control, I call that gambling.  When you decide to go down a path that gives you some influence on the outcome, I call it investing.  Buying a house is investing because you have the choice to get out of the market after you make the purchase.  Roulette is gambling because you can't get out once the wheel starts rolling.

@_date: 2017-12-06 19:11:03
so the left pane is a list of prices and the number of btc currently available to buy/sell at that price.  the right is a list of recent transactions and whether the purchase/sale price was above(green) or below(red) the price that preceded it.  top is the price over time, bottom is the volume available ( Y axis) for sale above/below the listed price (X axis).  So, if the red side has 500 btc (vertically) at 14000 (horizontally), that means that there are 500 btc for sale at 14000 *or more*
@_date: 2017-12-01 22:29:07
You have to decide whether your trust yourself or an FDIC and privately insured entity to keep track of your coins for you.  If you don't trust yourself, Coinbase is probably the most secure option.  I, for one, don't keep cash in my mattress....
@_date: 2017-12-01 22:00:08

@_date: 2017-12-01 22:08:45
the theory is valid, but in order for it to work out with any consistency in the real world you have to be able to predict the range of volatility.  sicne I last posted the 11kusd wall is less abrupt, which probably means that others are watching and willing to sell for under 11k to make the deal

It's ok to be a little pessimistic.  It was at like 10.6 a few hours ago.  just set optimistic low bids and hope to catch on the dip.  high fluctuation is the norm around here, not the exception.  Another drop to that level is only like a 5% change, completely possible, if not probable.  I'd have much more btc if I just played set-it-and-forget-it rather than cancelling my low bids and trying to time the dips by hand.

The best way for AI to do it is to hack every computer in the world and get them to have a consensus on fraudulent transactions.  But why would AI do this?  Why is AI motivated to have bitcoin?  What does AI need bitcoin for if its already at that ability level?  Bitcoin is a means to an end, and if AI can hack bitcoin, it doesn't really need bitcoin to achieve it's goes, right?
@_date: 2017-12-03 03:54:35
Another way to do this is plan for the inverse.  Have purchase orders set up for a favorable low price.  If you trust the technology and think that bitcoin is here to stay, your goal should be to get into the market as low as possible and hold forever.  If you're just trying to make money on the fluctuations, you might as well go to the casino.
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:30:15

Without going into details, when you say "all in" that could mean a lot of things.  If you're 21, living in your parents' basement, have a steady minimum wage job, and $1,000 cash to your name, sure, why not.  If you're $65 with $500k and looking towards retirement, probably a bad idea.
remember, by almost all metrics, bitcoin is a horrible investment.  volatile, unsecured, uncontrolled.  If you have a basic grasp of the technology and think it could be revolutionary, take a leap of faith.  I don't think of it as an investment as much as I think of it as an idealism that requires you to put your money where your mouth is.
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:47:33
well, looks like you made money now?
@_date: 2017-12-01 22:26:11
That's like saying you don't own the cash in your bank account.  Coinbase and GDAX are FDIC insured for your USD, and privately insured for your BTC.  It's just a matter of whether you trust yourself or coinbase and its insurers to keep track of the keys.
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:44:53
you're going to pay a lot in fees.  GDAX is a product of Coinbase, but smaller fees and realtime trading.
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:31:52
Coinbase is a Delaware corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco.  US Currency is FDIC insured, btc is privately insured.  they're also one of the the largest targets for attacks, so you decide where you want to allocate risk.
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:35:35
yeah, but where were those buyers when it was holding just below $12,000?  why did demand jump after it hit 12?
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:50:28
It sounds like you really don't understand a difference between correlation, causation, and proof.  Sure, there may be a correlation between the timing of a news piece and a drop in the market, but in order to PROVE that the article CAUSED the dip, you would have to convince someone that those who sold their BTC at the lower price did so based on the article.  It's not going to happen.  
If you're afraid of market drops, you've made a lot of mistakes.  (1) you're putting your money into a commodity that you don't truly understand, and (2) you've put too much of your net worth into that commodity.  If you understood and trusted the technology, you're in it for the long haul, which should mean that you're willing to hold onto your btc until it's worth enough that you don't need to work any more to support yourself, combined with other assets.  If you didn't put too much of your net worth into the market, then what does a dip in one of many assets really mean to you?
You're seriously off your rocker.  You think the media has an obligation to you?  These are corporations, their obligations are to their shareholders.  Maybe you should be investing in them?
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:45:42

@_date: 2017-12-01 18:38:57
some exchanges cost more because its the only place some individuals can buy btc (based on location, payment type, etc).  Once you buy at that price you don't want to transfer to a different exchange because you'll be selling for less.  There are some exchanges that have a worse history of fiat withdrawals, so if you have your btc on that exchange you better be getting it for a premium when compared to the risk of not being able to withdraw the fiat.
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:51:39
If you have two dollars in your account now, and the price doubles, you will have four dollars for a gain of two.  If you have two dollars in your account, take one out, and then the price doubles, you will have two dollars, for a gain of one.
A two dollar gain is greater than a one dollar gain.  Pulling money out prevents losing that money, but also prevents making more money.  Your choice.

That assumes that the market will fluctuate that amount in the time you're willing to wait, but yes, that's how it works.  If you watch GDAX you'll see huge price walls that gravitate around whole numbers, meaning that there's a chunk of people with limit orders at that price.

@_date: 2017-12-04 23:02:48
You have to do your own risk analysis.  Coinbase says they have private insurance for their BTC.  You have to balance your fear of a Coinbase hack/loss and uninsured event against the likelihood of you losing/destroying your cold wallet, assuming that's not insured.

It has to do with how the position of the moon corresponds to the earth's position relative to the sun.  The only reason we notice the annual dip is because this is the one of 13 moon cycles that's easiest to remember because it corresponds with the beginning of the year.  Because there are 13 moon cycles and 12 months, the monthly market event isn't noticed because it changes depending on the month, but they definitely happen.  This year, the dip is going to happen in the first five days of the year, but its predictability will be affected by the severity of NYE celebrations.  Depending on whether or not Trump is indicted will affect coastal fireworks shows and NYE enthusiasm, so until we know what action Mueller is taking this month, it's kinda up in the air.

not to give away my obvious secrets, but I regularly price above/below number walls by some inconsequential number.  lots of other people do too.  That's why you'll see a little blip at the bottom of the wall.  Same thing i do on eBay.  use a wacko number slightly higher than my whole number purchase price.  Do I really care if paying .68 cents more gets me the bid?

What happens when you no longer have access to your leather wallet?  Money is gone.  
@_date: 2017-12-03 03:33:47
I think you're talking about a stop-limit order.  Think of the "stop" as a price trigger, and a "limit order" as an offer to purchase/sell.  A stop-limit order places an an offer to purchase/sell price once the market hits a certain price.  You can also set a plain stop order which purchases/sells at market rate once the market hits a certain price.
The difference between the two is that with a stop-limit order you get to set the exact price for the BTC, and with a stop order you purchase at whatever the market rate is once a trigger is hit.
Let's say you want to sell your BTC if it drops to $8,000.  If you use a stop-limit order and set the trigger/stop to $8010 and the sell limit to $8,000, the market may be dropping so fast that your $8,000 offer is too high by the time the limit order is placed, and you never make the sale.  On the other hand, if you set a stop at $8,000 to sell at market price, in a fast-falling market you make end up selling for much less than $8,000.

I'm really looking for a graph that overlays the historical price on the different exchanges all at once with one line per exchange.  
@_date: 2017-12-03 03:46:41
You COULD.  You better have the $5k in USD ready to pay if BTC goes to zero, in which case you might as well put that money in now.  Or, if you don't care about your ability to get credit in the future you could just give it a try?  A smarter way to do it would be to max out the card, and set a limit order for a very favorable price, hoping that the market will dip and recover before the debt becomes due.  If the market doesn't dip, then you withdraw the USD and pay back the card.  The risk is that the market will dip and not recover by the time the debt is due.
with 0% APR for a full year you should be planning a year out, not one month out.  by pulling out your $5k every month you're increasing your transaction costs and minimizing the time that money is in the market growing.
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:04:26
When you buy $1k, you're buying a fraction of bitcoin at a certain value.  So if it's valued at $10k, you're buying .1 btc.  If it goes up or down, you still own .1 btc.

Payment by what employer?  How do you show damages if the value later increases past the value at the time of the alleged improper statement?  You still haven't overcome the issue of standing.  These are statements about bitcoin, an uncontrolled and unaffiliated digital asset.  It's not like shareholders in Disney who have some ownership in an entity with a corporate persona, and have the authority to sue on behalf of the corporation.  Bitcoin isn't an entity, it isn't a corporation, it doesn't have standing to sue.

Then use a little money to screw around a bit and make mistakes.  Learn about using buy/sell limits and try them out.  say the market is at 10000, set a buy at 9999 for like .00001, once that fills set a sell at 10001.  After watching the price fluctuate for a few days, weeks, months, you'll get a true understanding for how much it can fluctuate in a day, and maybe set some very optimistic limits and see if the market hits them, which is entirely possible.  It's doubled since mid-November, but the other day it had a severe 20% dip in what seemed like a few minutes.

@_date: 2017-12-06 01:45:06
but, bitcoin is a cash equivalent.  each person has the opportunity to exchange their btc to fiat at any point if the market value is a true fiat exchange value.  so, even if no more cash was used to purchase btc, and holders unanimously agreed to a 1M value, and there were willing buyers (making the value a true value) btc would still be 1/5 of the world's cash value.
if that's not the case, the 1M market price would be inflated, and not the true value.

What he may not have understood is that WE'RE ALL IN THE SAME SITUATION as him.  Whether he got rid of them too early, or lost them, we all decided to buy a cup of coffee, go to the movies, or otherwise spend $5 in March of 2010, rather than buying 5,000 BTC on Bitcoinmarket.
His mental health issues are what caused his suicide, and bitcoin was just the outlet.  The rest of us who are closer to neurotypical have found ways to cope with the prospect of lost opportunities.
What we all need to remind ourselves is that, in the moment, we make good decisions.  In May of 2010, was it a good idea to buy a pizza with 10,000 BTC?  Hell yeah!  It was worthless, and had no quantifiable prospect of success.  Was it a bad idea to sell a pizza for 10,000 BTC?  Definitely.

In order to get bitcoin to $1M, you'd have to have 1/4 of the world's cash in bitcoin, assuming 21M bitcoin, 80T cash in the world, and a universal consensus on value.
I'd say that it's unlikely.  But, even if just one person sells for 1M, does that make ALL coins worth 1M?  Unlikely.  Even though btc are all functionally equal, they don't have equal value.  1btc sitting in a paper wallet in the middle of a desert without access to internet or method of verification is worth less than the same coin sitting in a GDAX account.  Would you pay a stranger $10 cash for a paper wallet he promises contains 1btc? Likely not.

yeah, there's a difference between a Japanese corporation and an American corporation regarding insurance.  But you definitely still have to decide your own risk tolerance on whether Coinbase is underinsured despite their public claims.

Do you see a pending on the other end?  Is it still in the wallet?
lots of unverified transactions now.

No, i understood what you were saying.  I just can't imagine that someone else could have 80% of their net worth in crypto and not be young or have relatively few assets overall.  I'm guessing we're in relatively the same situation.

Coinbase is a Delaware corporation, and has private insurance for BTC and FDIC insurance for USD.  GDAX is a Fictitious Business Name of Coinbase, Inc.  So, GDAX is a product of Coinbase, not a separate entity.  By keeping your BTC or USD with Coinbase/GDAX you're trusting that Coinbase has private insurance that will pay out in case of BTC loss and trusting the FDIC in case of USD loss.  If/when Coinbase goes IPO, there will be more restrictions/regulations and legal safety nets.  But, the purpose of BTC is to go against the grain of all of those protections/institutions, so it's your call.
If you keep a paper wallet you're trusting that the software to generate and print the certificate doesn't make an error.  If you hand write the keys you're trusting yourself to not make an error.  Your also trusting yourself not to lose or destroy the paper.
If you keep a digital wallet (software on mobile, or hardware) your still trusting the companies that make and design those devices and software.
It all comes down to deciding who you trust most to keep track of your assets, yourself, the federal government, private insurance companies, or private software developers.  The choice is yours.

Just leave your computer mining and get a job delivering pizzas.  $850 is a lot for a 16yo, but at your age, not a lot to actually worry about losing.  If you have the forethought to start investing and holding your investments now, you'll be all the better 50 years from now.  Even if it triples, you sell, and you make $1,700, you'll blow the $1,700 on 16yo things like dates and video games.  If I was 16 again and had $850, I'd lock it up and prevent myself from looking at it for another 20 years.  At your age, I was a bigger risk to my financial future than Coinbase getting hacked.

Did you set up an account/wallet to accept the bitcoin?  An app on your cell phone, etc?

I think insurance may be a solution.  "Bank" holds your keys and has an insurance policy with a trusted insurer, just like the system we have now.


That's like saying if you don't have a dollar bill in your hand, you have nothing.  If its in a bank, you have FDIC insurance coverage.  By keeping it in the bank you're trusting the FDIC.  I trust the FDIC more than I trust my personal ability to hold onto paper, so I keep the money in the bank.  And, I don't have insurance coverage against myself.
Edit:  USD funds in GDAX and Coinbase are FDIC insured, and GDAX and Coinbase have insurance for the cryptocurrencies too.  Now, they could be lying, and your BTC could be uninsured.  If it all goes away, you and everyone else would have to sue for breach of contract, Coinbase fails, and you're SOL.  So, you're trusting that Coinbase actually has insurance coverage.  You have to weigh your trust in Coinbase's assertions to your trust in yourself to not F it up and lose your keys.  I know where I stand.
