I think the strength of BTC is just a reflection of the inherent weakness of fiat currencies.

The USD is [fiat]( BTC is not. "Fiat" means that the government forces people to use it for legally-enforceable transactions. No one is forced to use bitcoin.

There was a site called Poolitics back in 2004-2006 where you could bet on political events. I'm guessing they got shut down for legal reasons, but it might have just been a bad business plan. With some research you might be able to find the person who started that and get some advice.

[Fiat]( means either that people are forced to use it, or that people are forced to accept something as having more value than it actually has. The USD is a fiat currency; its value is declared by the US government. The market is determining the value of BTC.

So in other words, it adds $3.95 to the cost of pretty much any purchase I make?

How many KWH and CPU cycles do you think were spent generating all of the BTC that exist?

They don't literally print the money. The U.S. Mint does that.

There are bills in these states which seek to allow, for example, people to pay their taxes in gold, etc. Once the dollar collapses, the states still want to be able to collect their taxes.

How much extra electricity did you use to mine that?

The more people that use it, the less effect each individual action by a bitcoin owner has on the aggregate value of the currency. With more buyers and sellers of a currency, the easier it is to find a buyer when you're a seller, and the easier it is to find a seller when you're a buyer.

Inflation is an increase in the supply of money. Every year, the Fed creates more and more dollars. The economy grows, but the number of dollars chasing the available goods grows faster. With too much money chasing too few goods, you have inflation.
If Bitcoin becomes a significant force in the world economy, it could become extremely stable. Right now, it's fluctuating wildly due to its sudden rise in popularity and the large percentage of Bitcoin holders who are only holding Bitcoins for speculative purposes. If someone discovers a flaw in Bitcoin that allows them to cheat the system (by controlling more than half the network, for example), then Bitcoin could crash to zero overnight.

I think you should say something like,

"Recent"? When have they ever not wasted money that could reasonably be called *recent*?

Okay, so that's a *reason*, but a *good reason*? Isn't this just cluttering up the chain?

Why would you keep this many BTC in one wallet? Spread those babies around!

You can't lose something you don't have. If he bought 50 BTC for 50 USD, he has 50 BTC, not 50 USD. If he sells the BTC, then he has USD. Then an only then are his USD gains or losses realized.

Yes, but you need more and more of them each year to buy the same amount of stuff. If the gov't and Fed really screw things up, they could eventually be worthless.


Except the new Man is controlled by the users of the new currency. There is no central authority with great power to screw people over.


Nothing. Let them try.
