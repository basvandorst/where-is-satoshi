It's almost as if there's a power imbalance...

It's not necessarily common knowledge that the cryptocurrency world has its own robust exchange infrastructure. Just seems like the response might be more useful if the first paragraph was removed, the rest of it was inverted, and references to some specific exchanges were included, like so:
There are many exchange websites that specialize in trading between cryptocurrency and "real" (or what is more often called "fiat") money. These include Coinbase/GDAX, Bitfinex, Kraken, and many others. To see what the market looks like in real-time, go to bitcoinwisdom.com if you want to watch the charts, just like a stock-market chart.
The value is determined by the market. Meaning that people are buying Bitcoin from people for 3.2k currently. If it falls, it means people are not willing to pay that much. If it rises, it means people are willing to pay more.
Your bank account is linked to the exchange (it has to be to buy it in the first place). So after selling the coin, the money is deposited into your bank.

Perfect, thanks so much! I just had to do an "apt install python3-pip" first and your commands and it opened fine.

Sorry to pester, but I've installed the latest version (0.1.6) and I'm getting the following error: 
According to this page it might be an issue between Python 2/3: 
Do you know if I have to install Python 3 to run the recent versions of Cryptop and if so how I specify which version to run it in?

Right, it probably won't innovate that part of exchange business (as far as I know). Plenty of other reasons this is useful though.

No problem, thanks for making it. It's my favorite of all the portfolio trackers I've used. Lightweight and reliable.

Can't you just claim it from Electrum? Pretty sure any transactions after the fork can't produce BCH.

I've heard this before. It sounds like the idea is to lock your money away and never use it, just let it grow. Is the point to retire rich, build an empire for the future, or what?

If you care about decentralization and exchange, that is why.

This is quite the heap of of analogies and metaphors.

Explain the debt part.

Seems more like an issue of relative value in other currencies than deflation per se. They may be connected, but I don't think they're synonymous.

Are you basing those Bitcoin numbers on the USD price?

Betamax feels like a more appropriate format for comparison than VHS, at least in terms of OP's argument. Especially given that Betamax was widely seen as the technically superior format before it tanked.
Just listing some successful things isn't proof that Bitcoin is destined for success too.

That makes a lot of sense. Great points.

This is lovely. Just wondering if Dash is supported. I tried DASH and DRK as symbols and neither worked.

I agree. These fees are incredible and a huge barrier to both the everyday usage of Bitcoin and the usefulness of specifying price in mBTC.
@_date: 2017-07-30 10:16:02
Oh, awesome!
@_date: 2017-06-17 13:54:44
Seconded.
