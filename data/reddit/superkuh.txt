It's like they are scared of saying the word, "Bitcoin" and bend over backward to avoid it.

Right. But they use TCP connections so when the GFW can't see what's going on it'll start sending spoofed TCP reset packets and your VPN will stop being so useful.
A better solution for operating in China is to use full system shadowsocks (redir mode) with KCP/kcptun to go over UDP and prevent that specific kind of attack.

If that's really true then you wouldn't be able to spend this on Steam. With Bitcoin there's a mimimum purchase limit on steam. I tried to buy a $4 game with Bitcoin and it was too low.

No one commenting on how using graphics cards for Bitcoin mining has been pointless for years? I guess I get to be the first.

Maybe in terms of the number of this particular type of incident. But the vast majority of tax fraud is done in the traditional economic networks and currencies by flight to tax havens and the corrupt businesses based there. And by this I mean actual criminal tax fraud, not just questionable ethical abuses of the system. Even with that narrow focus the current estimate is ~$300 billion/year globally.

It's not just Tor tails users that are effected. I couldn't figure out how to get an actual bitcoin address at all with Firefox. So instead I just sent a ticket to my VPS host and recommended they switch Bitcoin payment intermediaries.
About an hour later (now) I've finally found this post on how to extract the address and actually use the Bitcoin network to pay instead HTTP post to your website. But that also means I'll lose 2-3 minutes of my countdown timer every time I want to pay my VPS host who uses Bitpay. Which means I'll have to set slightly higher fees.
Additionally, by not allowing users to simply copy an address and requiring all this copy paste and URL synthesis by hand you're far more likely to introduce errors in payment.

Yup. I went to pay one of my online bills with BTC last week and the merchant used Bitpay as an intermediary. It turns out Bitpay no longer provides a Bitcoin address to send funds to. Instead they want you to send the transaction of HTTP Post to their webserver. It's some obscure BIP that no one uses or really supports.
But for me Bitcoin means sending transactions over the P2P network. So I paid the merchant with fiat using a debit card and told them if they don't switch providers by next month I'm moving.
