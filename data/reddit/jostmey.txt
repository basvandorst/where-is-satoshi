No, the software does not need to be open at the time of payment :-)

The database contains over 20,000 items. It is not quite enough to return decent search results. But, new items are being added weekly.
As for what is next, I have not decided. I may create a live notification system, so that when someone buys something new, it will be displayed in the live feed. But I have not decided on that yet.

I lost two fingers in 'Nam. So does that mean I sell at 8? Or do I average 10 toes with 8 fingers to get 9?

Actually, Disqus has a thumbs up/down button, and the reviews are sorted by rating. That said, if I ever find the time I write my own reviewing system, so that I can grant other websites access to the data through an API. But that is if I ever find the time :-)

I have actually personally talked with them over the phone. They seemed genuinely committed to building the best possible bitcoin store. That said, their service is new, and anyone who has done serious programming knows that glitches can occur.
I know that several people have bought items from them :-)
