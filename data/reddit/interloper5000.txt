It was a nice science project.  You have to give BTC that.

How the fuck do tax savings add to the debt? This guy is a mental gymnast.

Very little of your taxes goes to actually paying for anything. It mainly pays the interest on the debt and very little to the principle. The QRs that Congress has been passing every few months doesn't really increase spending, but keeps almost a steady rate on those programs both sides believe is the most important to their constituents: social welfare programs for the left and military spending for the right. 
Your claim, however, is that less taxes increases the debt. It doesn't. And both parties don't want that because if you actually paid for the fucking debt, not future generations, you would say fuck that shit. So they get around it by having the FED monetize the debt and the Treasury prints into bills. This is what economist call the "silent tax", which is inflation of the monetary supply (M1 and M2).  
@_date: 2018-01-31 02:29:20
Tax savings means you keep more of what you make. It doesn't add to the national debt. 
Also, that is a really bad analogy. The government doesn't hire me. It just uses force to take our money to give to other people.

I use Tor and know how it works. But why is it needed for a BTC mixer? Do the transactions record an IP address? 
How do you know or test if it actually works?
@_date: 2018-05-03 22:29:11
I'm sure that works but way too many steps and the transactions fees add up.

Binance isn't better than any exchange that has fiat pairs.

The price of wood isn't due to "inflation". It's because there are only a few mills, or only a few companies that own the market. In other words, there is little competition. They even close down for weeks at a time if they don't reach a certain order amount.

Judging by your mastery of the English language, you should probably learn that first before becoming interested in cryptography.
If an exchange doesn't have a fiat pair, that then means you have too...? You're going to have to start thinking if you expect to succeed in life.

I don't know about the UK, but in the US this information would be found in court documents. Then again, I wouldn't expect anything from a country the size of Rhode Island and arrests someone for making a YouTube video of his Pug making a Nazi salute.

Friend, I've had dinner with two Russian doctors (they are married) last week that have parents that were communists and party leaders. While they have disagreements with their parents, they said that the ending, while unpleasant, is around the corner. Hang strong and educate people on free markets. Try and hold out as long as possible so these fuck ups don't own.your country.

Why would BTC go up in value when no new money is coming in and there is no real use case for BTC?  Bob and Sally's Yogurt Shop in NYC isn't a good example of a use case.

Bull fucking shit they do. I'm always coaching women at work that bitch and moan they aren't getting a raise but feel "demanding" or "pushy" and never ask their direct supervisor for a raise. I also told them you need to inform them of the value you're creating for the organization.
Besides butches, and women that have a lot of brothers, most women skirt anything they perceive as confrontational, which is a wide net to cast from my observation.
Look, I grew up a horny fucker and lerned things I probably shouldn't have when I was 10 from a girl the same age as I was that lived next door. I've been fucking a lot of chicks through years (not anymore since I'm close to becoming married), and all those chicks were all over the place on the political spectrum, ethnicity and at different stages socio-economically, but they all shunned risk and what they preceived as confrontation.
