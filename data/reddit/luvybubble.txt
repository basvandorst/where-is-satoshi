The size of the network does nothing to slow down centralization of mining.
@_date: 2016-04-07 18:06:48
And here I thought Trump made up data. You can't show a list of 20 chinese miners. And none provable.
@_date: 2016-04-07 18:08:24
Think again. If all the mining is under the control of five people, then those five people could end up threatened or compromised. That is why centralization is bad.

I enjoyed Scaling 1, I attended. I'm looking forward to 2 (wish I could go to Hong Kong). But for my money, [James' little 8 minute video]( is the best talk I've seen on scaling and the block size debate.
@_date: 2014-11-05 13:56:16
He doesn't deny what you say. But he does suggest that number 1 CAUSED number 2. Which makes him right about both one and two.
@_date: 2014-06-09 01:04:04
nope. it was the secp256r1 that was rumored. the koblitz curve is what bitcoin uses and there's no room in there for a back door.
@_date: 2014-11-04 17:26:57
James has a chart 51 minutes in that confirms exactly what you say about partisanship. Its my favorite chart in the video.
@_date: 2014-11-04 17:28:10
He blasts both Clinton and Obama later in the video. On that one data set however (and unfortunately for those who hate those guys), they came out okay.
@_date: 2014-06-08 16:41:55
Its safe to say he sits on the far optimist side of the issue.

Its actually there in the asterix (small print) right in the video. But don't worry he blasts obama minutes later.

Seems cool, but I'm still confused. 'Gentle' says "Upload your nLockTime transactions .zip file", so I repeat. Is nLockTime currently supported by Bitcoin?

Actually he found the 'hack' of congress, the actual source of dozens of problems (inside a 1970 bill). Its really incredible.

Very cool. Glad I asked. Is that currently doable inside of bitcoin? I thought that timelock feature was disabled.
@_date: 2014-12-30 17:20:56
I agree with both of your points. And re-reading your post, you say 'currently'. So you are correct. But lots of bitcoin is being developed to answer both of your problems, and the compelling idea that folks around the world could invest small amounts is true today and novel.
@_date: 2014-11-04 17:25:42
well, that's what I thought, most people thought until James posted this video. The data, now doesn't support your ideas.

hmmm...everything proves its resilience until it doesn't. optimists exist in all times and places. but here we don't need to guess about how iceberg ready bitcoin is. you can do the math on a 51% attack and it really is just too easy to accomplish.

Really. Sounds like you're ignorant. You're talking about the person who's done some of the better work on 51% attacks.

There's no restriction on who can play in the NBA either. There's no restriction on who can develop a driverless car. There's no restriction on who can build a spacecraft. So why aren't you doing all of those? Or do you think?
@_date: 2016-03-04 13:40:59
Not if "a few individuals" create the laws. That would be centralized, and likely lead to corruption. 
@_date: 2015-07-14 00:06:13
lol. If I had a nickle for all the things that were supposedly going to happen in a few years that never happened or took 20 years...
@_date: 2016-02-12 13:56:57
Lets see an enormous percentage of Bitcoin mining is controlled by a small number of individuals in China, and you claim it is de-centralized?
@_date: 2016-02-10 04:18:26
This is painful to read.
@_date: 2017-09-22 07:00:41
I'm confused how does one prove that their exchange is not in China. Couldn't they just keep running while pretending they are from Japan? Or Norway?
@_date: 2015-11-11 23:55:25
The good news (or great news) is that adding identity to mining can allow Bitcoin to scale almost infinitely, immediately.
@_date: 2015-03-20 18:56:37
Bitcoin will eventually be as dark as you need. Upgrades will be coming.

@_date: 2015-11-11 20:59:12
Sounds like you are hoping that to be the case. Folks have been saying the same thing for 3 years and mining only gets more centralized each year, and would likely happen even with 1k blocks.

each bubble creates press, and the press creates bubbles, and so on and so on. but, because bitcoin has real value (features that boggle the mind), the price will pitch and dive, but continue to rise for the foreseeable future.

If there were no police, most of us would commit crimes, so it would become harder to do, and yield less reward. Their protections, strangely, can make it very profitable for the few who do it.
