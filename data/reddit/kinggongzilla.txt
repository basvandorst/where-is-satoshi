Hi! Thanks for signing up.
We want to take the "Wikipedia approach" and fund our running costs (which fortunately are very low) through donations from the community. However we are also prepared to cover the costs ourselves for the foreseeable future.

Good question!
Fortunately we managed to keep a very lean cost structure. So our runing costs are extremely low. Therefore we are prepared to cover the costs for the foreseeable future ourselves. Moreover we will accept donations from the bitcoin community. 
We want to take a similar approach to wikipedia, where the people provide the content (buying and selling bitcoins) and we provide the platform which is financed through donations.

Hi thanks for you question:
Here are the main differences:
* We want to make trading bitcoins easy to use and accessible to everyone around the globe. With Open Bitcoins you don't need to download any additional software. You can buy and sell bitcoins only with a browser and an internet connection. 
* We charge no fees. It is our mission to provide free bitcoin trading to all people around the globe. Even the small fees that Bitsquare is charging can add up over time. In a different comment I called our business model the "wikipedia approach". We want to cover costs by accepting donations.

I just answered this question in a different comment. :-)

Our model is very similar to LocalBitcoins. However we provide escrow protection without charging commission.
