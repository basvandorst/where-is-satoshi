Same, application error for me too.

I'm not sure, but I think CC is just a backup at Coinbase in case the withdrawal from your bank account fails - I don't think you can use it as a primary method of buying BTC. FWIW, I use BoA &amp; Coinbase too and I've sold and bought BTC over the past 2-3 weeks and had no problem (knock on wood). I would follow up with BoA and ask them why they reversed it and then go from there. Good luck.

I'm pretty new to BTC and i don't think I understand it quite as well as others on here but this is my main qualm with what he writes:


Isn't that kind of the point of BTC and what makes it so revolutionary? the fact that there is no person that "put the eggs in the forest" so to speak who can't arbitrarily alter their value or worth? He even mentions in the article about banks issuing notes and kings issuing coins that they did not accept as payments, which caused their value to drop. Doesn't BTC avoid this problem by having a transparent, un-alterable formula that determines how many are created and how often?
To me, it seems like he's arguing that BTC has no value because its issuers don't have the power to decide whether or not it is accepted as a payment and what its value is. But my understanding is that characteristic is exactly why BTC is so unique and so many people support it: *because* there's no one that can suddenly decide not to take it or make more of it. Am I off-base here?
