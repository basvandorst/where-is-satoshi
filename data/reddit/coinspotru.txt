Okay guys, what really happened is the Minister of Finance said in recent interview that they are still working on the digital currency bill and decided not to apply penalties for cryptocurrency users. The "Leader" said nothing and confirmed nothing, he has more stuff to do. Good news anyway.

Simple justice in this case, no policy change. Court decision that caused blocking was not legit from the start and a couple of good lawyers helped to overturn it.

Posted TLDR below.

@_date: 2015-06-21 20:59:40
Yep, it is :)
@_date: 2015-06-11 09:26:54
Just in US, not Russia (weird, but fact)
@_date: 2015-06-11 11:05:03
Bingo :)
@_date: 2015-06-21 21:56:21
Every ISP disables blocking itself and possibly not each of them is prompt to react on Sundays :)

Both tv and russian.rt.com. But yea I meant broadcast in the first place.

TL;Too Russian;DR
Next week CB meets with financial experts;
CB's attitude has changed;
Some of operations can be legal and regulated;
References to regulation in the world and UK initiative;
Brief of “Russian ban” and CB's attitude development;
Need regulation not anonymity (expert opinion);
Legalization is logical step (expert opinion);
Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Economics positions not changed (ban);
Advantages are obvious, bitcoin is currency, cryptocurrencies are future, ban is fail for economics (different expert opinions);
Bitcoins won't harm local economics, not widely adopted, difficult to buy and cash out (expert opinion);
If legalized, official regulated exchange needed, transactions tied to real people, KYC (expert opinion);
Penalties for scammers (expert opinion);
Bitcoin legal in Russia in 1-2 years (expert opinion).

Maybe this how-to-buy-and-sell-bitcoin link should help 
@_date: 2015-06-11 20:33:51
Well it would also be a contender to RUR then and govt won't encourage this. This can also be kind of dont-care-lets-ban position, Mr. P is very offline guy :) And RT does what's told from above, afaik that's one of most pro-Kremlin media out here. 
@_date: 2015-06-11 09:34:21
Sure you're right. I mean no Max Keiser stuff on local RT.
@_date: 2014-11-28 04:53:21
Russians are really into bitcoin, e.g. there would be a conference held in Saint-Petersburg soon: 
Here's what Jon Matonis says: 
It's hard to promote anything actively here when gov-t plans to fine users starting from spring. 
Many BTC businesses are runned by Russians but outside of the country due to circumstances. Here is a good article from local Forbes, hope Google translate is ok: 
Anyway people here are sick of ruining economy, sanctions, anti-US and anti-EU propaganda, Ukraine situation and all that political bs. No one wants war or any aggression. No whining, just facts. Thanks for support!

Yep, realized this soon after posting here, tnanks.

Only 1600 were interviewed, not "most" I'd say:)
@_date: 2015-05-15 15:26:44
Thanks :)
@_date: 2015-05-15 16:58:59
Guys, it's simple fairness and good lawyers. The decision for blocking was illegal from the start, common thing out here. 
@_date: 2015-05-15 17:31:32
I just mean 1600 is not 80% of Russians
@_date: 2015-01-13 15:23:48
Ok, it's 2 more resources, here is the court decision (in russian): 
@_date: 2015-01-13 15:07:24
Hey Reddit, we are top Russian news source, also got under blocking. Luckily our hosting provider (not Russian of course) was notified beforehand and could warn us so we managed to change our domain from coinspot.ru to coinspot.io and inform our visitors about this in time.
So it's not only bitcoin.org and us, it's also btcsec.com (oldest and respected Russian resource), BTC-wiki bitcoin.it and local exchange indacoin.com, maybe anything else, we are looking for information righr now. Obviously the court judgement is fabricated, no one ever contacted us, none of the bitcoin information is legally banned in the country, there were just a couple of bill drafts, critisized by Ministry of Economics btw. Can answer any question in order to avoid wrong interpretation. Thanks
@_date: 2015-01-27 22:25:45
Great. Contact Durov directly for assistance, he is very pro-bitcoin and loves good innovaions.
@_date: 2015-05-15 17:37:39
Yes, but it's been drag on for a year already with no decision. Not sure if it changes soon, not sure if it's good or bad either.

That de ja vu feeling from Jan'15. FYI, they just need to add a mirror domain to bypass the block. Here is a retrospective of last year's blocks

Oh wow. Will spread this, very illustrative.

Thank you, now ELI5 please :)

Doesn't work for NVC and DCR for some reason, maybe anything else.
Thank you for the useful thing, maybe it would be better to set public posting by default?

Can you just convert your btc to neteller usd/eur and use the card? They never offered bitcoin balances as far as i know.
@_date: 2015-02-27 12:56:16
It's not

Our Liberal Democratic Party is the official govt freak show since 90s, nothing surprising :)
