Sorry but non of these domains are premium domains. Premium domains are one word (or one expression only). A premium domain would be:  
Nevertheless, these are really good domains !

Oh well, apparently some other similar account did exist. I didn't really searched for one, I was doing this for fun tonight.  
Sorry about that.

But if someone hack blockchain.info, wouldn't they be able to withdraw all my bitcoins ?

Thanks for your answer, would have prefer a direct link instead of your affiliated website but I understand ^^ (I had a lot of websites like yours a while ago :p) Could you tell me more about dividend ?

Sorry if it sounded aggressive, not my goal at all, I was just curious ;)
@_date: 2013-03-06 19:01:45
Sounds great but looks like I can only buy SLL :/

Really good advice. Bitcoin is still really young and, compared to real currencies, almost nobody knows about it. The more websites/businesses will accept bitcoins, the more the value will go up. I really think that within one year, the bitcoin will be over 100$ (and I think that in 4/5 years, it could really be around 1000$). Don't cash out everything.

And what about just creating a wallet on my computer ? (scare the hell out of me if I break/lose my computer)

That' funny how people troll about BFL/Avalon. I ordered a BFL Single and I'm excited about the latest news. Am I impatient ? Yes. Am I going to post everywhere that BFL is waaayyyy better that Avalon ? Nope and I don't know/care by the way. All I want is mine whenever I will receive my rig because it's a hobby.
I feel like all of these people that says shit about BFL are people that didn't bought any ASIC miner or people doing it for the money (you shouldn't have bought it thinking you would get rich, you won't).
BFL is just trying to ship great products, I'm cool with that.
Bitcoin is about people doing things to help the network, please don't lose the focus. And don't worry, if you get seriously involved in bitcoins, you'll get returns wether you mine with an ASIC or not.

They don't upgrade accounts anymore :/
@_date: 2013-03-24 10:11:45
Sounds great, and do you know how often they pay dividends ?
@_date: 2013-03-24 10:38:54
Sure, PMd you my email ;)
@_date: 2013-04-07 13:48:48
Well... it's "just" $48k, looks like some people lost WAY more than that being stupid ;)
@_date: 2013-03-06 19:01:58
Why not :)

If you are in Paris, I'll buy you some in person for cash. 
@_date: 2013-03-05 22:02:42
Il'll make it every 15 minutes then.
@_date: 2013-03-31 14:58:23
When they start shipping, please don't come back whining about BFL. But I understand why you did it.
@_date: 2013-03-05 21:48:58
Sorry about that, I was really just trying to help :/
@_date: 2013-03-24 11:16:01
I won't forget ! ;)
