Bare with me but, what if, and this is a big what if but, what if Andreas is actually CIA and he is telling us to focus on the technology because he knows that the infighting will actually be what cements btc as legitimate.  He understands that the drama is what keeps people glued to the community and by not calling each other shills and fud spreaders he knows that only the tech will be focused on leading the community to become boring and only technical with the leaders of the community becoming the Adepts of cryptography jargon, thereby single handedly dismantling the community.

honestly I think this whole discussion points to the obvious question.  what good does the government do?  obviously in this situation they are doing nothing but harm to the crypto communities.  this is a slight blow to the community at large and a very large blow to NY. but, sorry for this but, who even cares about NY, isnt it sort of a cesspool?  at what point does this vampiric government that we are bound to become too much to handle?  at what point does the relentless regulations rules laws taxations theft and violence just get to be too much to handle.

it wont be much more accessible in murica.  the federal government will make sure of that.  business that sell bitcoin are mandated by the feds to get all that info.  you think coinbase wants to piss off its customers and ask them a shitload of stupid ass questions?  nope it pisses people off and turns them off.  but, government.

Currently I have the majority of my private keys on my trezor which, honestly, the gen pop doesn't even know is a thing.  Seems safe enough.  I do also buy (throw my money away) on shitcoins and have been thinking about paper walleting them (possible toilet paper later)  If I get a comp that doesn't have a wireless card and has never been online can I just use fucking windows to print out some paper wallets?  My plan is to transfer the paper wallet programs via virgin flash drive to the offline comp and print them there then use a shit phone to photograph the PUBLIC addresses and send shitcoins from the phone.  This is a safe way to store my shitcoins?  I would hate to lose my $30 worth of html5 or my 1.2B cagecoin prolly worth about $30 I'm guessing...
TLDR; Do I have to use ubuntu or linux on an offline comp to print paper wallets?  if so, what is easiest way?  Never used em.

My payouts were for like .00026933~and maintenance fee was .00026932~etc.  like the maintenance fee would always take all the payout leaving a whopping .00000001/day payout.  atleast ol dude has a bunch of nice new red racing cars though.  haha.  he got me, I usually don't fall for this ponzi scheme shit but, they got me.

*Goldbug here.  I doubt there would be too much risk of a gold
confiscation at this point.  Even if so, no government ever has confiscated jewelery.  The reason the gold had to be turned in in the '30s was there was a gold standard and gold in the vault was needed to print more money.  This is obviously no longer the case.  A bitcoin confiscation?  How would they even do that with so many ways to hold/store cryptos?  I guess it doesn't mean they wouldn't try.

Isn't amazing that a pallet of fucking paper would thought to have any value?  It would be one thing, I guess, if it was at least limited in supply.

@_date: 2015-04-01 16:16:05
This is why government should always be limited.  When you start handing out unfathomable power badges, sometimes you'll end up with someone who steals 700,000 btc.
@_date: 2015-04-02 14:17:06

Honestly I was on the fence about buying until I saw that big drop and went ahead and grabbed up another btc.  buy low.

Gold is more anonymous than btc

What if...and I mean "what if", this entire post was actually just created by a three letter agency quantum computer in an attempt to further route out crypto anonymity? 
@_date: 2015-04-10 13:55:21
lol  oh well, its a step in mainstream acceptance amirite?

Is this good or bad for bitcoin?

Actually taxes aren't even enough to pay for all the war.  You have to debase the currency at full speed to be able to have enough dollars to pay for all the war.

Meth affects society moron, Cannabis is one thing but Meth is dangerous to other people too.  If someone wants to kill themselves on heroin idgaf

lol what was this post even about.  also why are the butters such assholes sometimes?
@_date: 2015-03-12 16:07:30
devil's advocate.  It's not necessarily all cornbase's fault.  remember the regulatory/government environment in which they are operating.
@_date: 2015-10-27 17:59:21
@_date: 2015-10-16 22:25:38
I'd buy some at a quarter for sure.

I have had many successful transactions with Provident.  If it's listed on the website, as soon as payment clears, its on it's way (with tracking.)  as a "silverbug" well, we talk.  Provident is one of the good companies, so far.
@_date: 2015-10-27 17:48:24
Silver is probably safer than btc.  NSA can't hack silver with quantum computers...yet.  Plus shit man, $16.  That's damn near a combo meal.  Give up the burger for the silver dollar I say.

for reference I have had many awesome buys from provident.  they also sell the silver dogecoin!  they also were involved in sponsorship of doge-driver Josh Wise.  Texas company.  Give 'em a try.  they take e-checks, credit, btc, ltc, doge, paypal, money orders?
