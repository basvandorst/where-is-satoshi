Look it up, a lot of banks already use it, and the worlds biggest banks are partnered with Ripple, but still have to implement it, it will take a couple of years I guess

How is the price relevant?

I used to be a huge Ripple fanboy and hate on bitcoin, but I realized a couple of months ago that both exist for their own separate purposes, I hold about 50/50 XRP and BTC now, I have high hopes for the future of BTC and I think Ripple is tackling a complete different problem :)

Hey, if it doesn't do anything for you, that's fine. But Ripple has its own use cases separate from Bitcoin, and it made me quite rich, so I can't complain...

Transaction time is 2-4 seconds, fees are low.
You can use the ripple network to transfer XRP, BTC, or any other type of currency.
I can pay someone in BTC without ever having to hold BTC. Ripple can use bridges to convert to other currencies in real-time.
I'd recommend you to do some research and don't take my word for anything ;)

Believe what?

Doesn't this mean that Litecoin is better than bitcoin?

You can run your own server, it might not be as decentralized as bitcoin, but I can transfer 10K in 2 seconds with minimal transaction fee.

That's why its good to invest now, before they do lol

It all depends when you bought/sold... I bought ripple at 1 cent. Does it matter how often I use Ripple? Ripple is designed for banks. I only use bitcoin to invest, same with Ripple. Doesn't matter if I hold XRP or BTC, whatever goes up more is the thing I'm interested in

Bitcoin is bytes on a hard disk. Real money is also bytes on a hard disk. I think they're both equally as real!
