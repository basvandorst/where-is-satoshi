DNC never rigged their primary. This is Russian disinformation and all of reddit fell for it. All of the emails about DNC officials endorsing Hillary, coordinating with here were after May 5th, when she had mathematically won the primary. Bernie wouldn't concede for a whole month.

It's the other way around actually, inflation is the increase in prices of goods and services. 
The title is about depreciation of the Zimbabwe dollar, which is intertwined with Hyperinflation. They can cause each other in a spiraling reaction. 
In this case was caused by printing money, lying about it and All-star level corruption and bad governance.

How is that possible? In 2017, the government of Zimbabwe made inflation illegal! 
At the very least, they made it illegal to raise prices, I think.

No, you’re wrong. The federal reserve is the bank the Treasury borrows from. Only the Treasury can print money, but the Treasury cannot print money it doesn’t have. Treasury borrows money from the Fed to print money, which the Treasury uses to fund the government. Then the Treasury collects taxes to pay back the Fed. 
The congress appointed board of the Fed determines how much money the government can borrow at what interest rates. They choose rates based on maximizing certain objectives like inflation target. This system protects against the horrors of deflation and hyperinflation. At least, it is the best system that we know of to prevent government causing hyperinflation.

The government decides to sell securities to the public to fund itself. Treasury securities are a promise by the government to pay back a loan plus interest. Buying a security is equivalent to loaning the government money. So it's the government that decides to take out a loan and pay interest on it. Important point here, the government's 
borrowing decisions are made completely independently of the Federal Reserve's lending decisions. 
The Fed, if it wanted to expand the money supply as you said, it would buy securities on the open market, from other banks who bought them from the government. When the Fed buys securities, it does indeed "create money out of thin air", i.e. it simply deposits the purchase amount in the seller's account with the Fed. Because of fractional reserve banking, when the fed buys $10B of securities from a bank, the bank gets to loan out $100B to people who want loans. 


No, **the Fed is a non-profit organization**. This is such a simple, easily verifiable fact that conspiracy theorists always conveniently leave out.


At the end of the year, after the Federal Reserve has paid its operational expenses, **"profits" are directly transferred over to the US Treasury**, i.e. the taxpayer is getting this money. It is no small amount by the way, the Federal Reserve handed over $92 billion in 2016. That's net savings of $92 billion for US taxpayers. That means about 2% of the government's budget is paid for by the Federal Reserve's profits. 


That's because you only have a surface level knowledge of the system. Try coming up with a better system of checks and balances for preventing the government from overprinting, defaulting or destabilizing the economy. This is the best system we've come up with so far. 


Congrats for ending your comment with a silly antisemitic canard. Rothschilds have nothing to do with the Fed.

A wildly volatile time series plot looks relatively stable if you plot it on a logarithmic y-axis. Brilliant.
