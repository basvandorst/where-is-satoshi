I think you missed the point. Everyone is going to use bitcoins in the future, it just wont be Bitcoin. 
Bitcoin is the internet CD you used 25 years ago. Do you know anyone who connects to the internet like that today?

Ahh yes, things really changed since 2008. Banks were held accountable and the CEO's went to jail.

Well now that's just pure FUD isn't it? 
On no advantages, Ethereum can perform more transactions than BTC and does so both cheaper and faster. Can you not see an advantage to this? Add then turing completeness and smart contracts and this is why all the fortune 500s are lining up to get involved.
Is it a bubble? Maybe. But then again maybe it's just you living in a bubble.

How is transaction cheapness not a feature and why is the inflation relevant to this? It's not like ETH has depreciated as a result of the inflation and its common knowledge that ETH will have a lower inflation than BTC once it switches to PoS. Want to go over the historical inflation rates for BTC and talk about how BTC didn't work as a store of value? Plus this discussion is bogus as BTC was never meant to be a store of value, but digital cash. 
BTC is used for 'gas' in the very same way as ETH is, or does BTC suddenly have free transactions or can you pay them in USD?
