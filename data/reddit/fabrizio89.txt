I know, but the whole society is structured so that people can take advantages on weakness of things or others. Look at it like an extension of evolution: bitfinex was weak, it had to be attacked. I don't care about philosophy of code and shit, he did what he was good at. Is it fucking people? who cares. Who had to protect my asset didn't do so: bitfinex and me.

The fee only applies if you have shares on LMB Holdings and want to transfer them on Havelock and viceversa, so only between platforms. If you have shares on Havelock and you sell them there, you only have to pay a fee to the site itself which is like 0.4%

Well the first thing I notice comparing this service to Soundcloud is that it's really intuitive and loads extremely fast. It feels fluid and uploading/tagging files is actually a breeze where on Soundcloud it takes a bit of time.
A problem I noticed is that it seems like "keyword search" doesn't search for tags too, but only words that are in the song title, tried with " too.

It is not about volume. It's an order, and if anyone sells 9000 coins at once to fill it, money must be there. Volume is inflated because there are no fees and the same coins swap hands continously everytime the price changes a bit.

If you want to create a safe trustless wallet, you can generate public and private key here: 
Download the html and put it on a completely offline computer, then print it. You can transfer your btc there everytime you want, but be careful that if you want to have access to them using some sort of wallet that doesn't generate another address for your coins, you will have to move them all out of there. If you import your keys on bitcoin-qt the process should be automatic and you can move just the bits you need.

In the coming months basically everyone who has access to his private keys will eventually move its bch to sell them on exchanges. It's an incentive that will eventually become very appealing even at this price. At this point it will be possible to determine how many bitcoins were just dormient up until now and how many are lost, at least we will have a better understanding of the real supply out there.

Considering how many tokens they bought back from people that sold at very low (20 cents if not lower i don't remember and not care looking at it), this is not true at all, it still evident how an unregulated market is just full of ways to fuck people and if you can't see this than you're just lying to yourself.

No, the market cap on Havelock simply indicates the total value in bitcoins considering at what price the last trade of shares took place on the same site.

This is their business plan: 
These are some brief details: 
Strong aspects:
-   low investment costs: only $5 / 1GH/s (4 times cheaper than competing products)
-   low maintenance costs due to low power dissipation of the chip: approximately 0.2-0.3 Watt / 1GH/s (4-20 time better than competition)
-   4 year manufacturer warranty
Weak aspects:
-   chip not tested yet, tape out in 1 month (full mask, engineering run), final simulation results will be posted in 2 weeks
-   deployment of 100TH-mine in July 2013
The proposed project is a 100 terahash/s Bitcoin mine. The hashing hardware will consist of mining boards developed in collaboration with BitFury. Today’s network hashing power is 4 times lower than 100TH/s but this situation will change dramatically in the next 4 months before the deployment of the hardware. The hardware will be located in the datacenter operated by MegaBigPower.com. The monthly maintenance and management costs will be kept at the 5k USD level. Hardware will be produced and assembled in June 2013. Mining will start at the data center on 2012-07-01. Estimations based on a predicted realistic continuous monthly network hashrate increase of 100TH/s (starting from 0TH/s on 2013-01-01) and BTC exchange rate of 17 USD point to a return of investment of 500k USD in 3 months after mining starts, i.e. in September 2013. Total income over the next 4 years after subtraction of the initial investment costs of 500k USD amounts to 2.7M USD. The suggested valuation of the venture is 500k USD (5 USD per 1GH/s, 1 USD per share), which is currently much below the retail purchase price of the hardware from competing suppliers. The venture will be legally operated as a PicoStocks project. No separate legal entity will be created.
The main risk of the project is the delay of the installation of the mining equipment. PicoStocks, legally responsible for the project, will reimburse investors if an income of 1M USD (10 USD per 1GH/s, 2 USD per share) will not be achieved by the mine until end of 2016 due to delayed installation.

You can use [Virwox]( to buy bitcoins with Paypal. First, you buy SSL (Second Life currency), then you convert them to BTC, it may seem clunky but it's quick. Your first withdrawal will take up to 48 hours (then everything will be instant), don't panic, I used them for a while. After some withdrawals, your deposit limit from Paypal will rise from 50€ to 300€ per month.
[The moderator]( of the italian subforum on bitcointalk.org sells bitcoins for Paypal, I bought from him and he's reliable, but he's not always available for business.

Make a wallet with bitcoin-qt (this client will download the entire blockchain, 16gb+, if you don't want to wait you can use electrum or armory) on a hard disk you know you will use just to spend your coins and encrypt it with the option on the client (write the password down, it must be very long, better if nonsensical phrases with random characters). If the day after your bitcent is still there, you did everything correctly. :P
If you want to invest a substantial amount, make different wallets and store them in different devices.
With time, everything will be much easier and regulated companies are emerging everywhere to safely store your savings.

ASICMiner is the only one that is shipping constantly and within days from the order.
There are some resellers like BTCGuild (there's a store on the pool site, yes) and a store in chinese.

Well it is a projection based on past dividends. Go here  and look in the "History" tab, you will see every dividend paid and the projection on the right. The price considered there was lower (1.67), but the deployement of new hardware was just at the beginning aswell. We could very well see higher and higher dividends for the next few months, until new companies (hopefully) catch up.
@_date: 2013-05-18 06:27:33
Actually the annual dividends revenue is at ~50%, they could still be undervalued, it all depends how much risk investors consider acceptable. The main issue right now is hardware safety I think.

1 Yes. Don't trust web wallets. You can download a wallet [here]( I feel comfortable with bitcoin-qt (this client will download the entire blockchain, 16gb+, if you don't want to wait you can use electrum or armory) on a hard disk you know you will use just to spend your coins and encrypt it with the option on the client (write the password down, it must be very long, better if nonsensical phrases with random characters).
4-5  |  &lt;- Beware of scammy people, bring a friend, choose a crowded place.
6 You can use bitcoin anywhere if a merchant is associated with bitpay. If they directly accepts bitcoin they will probably show you a qr code that you can scan with your smartphone and instantly send over the coins. There are services like [bitsumo]( that will let you spend anywhere even if a merchant doesn't accept bitcoins or doesn't use bitpay. 
@_date: 2013-05-24 07:18:20
You can ask the issuer to make your shares real, friedcat will contact you and complete the deal probably before 24 hours. On bitfunder there's a minimum of 250 shares, on btc-tc you can transfer even 1 single share.
@_date: 2013-05-02 11:04:15
Use them on Virwox then. Seems like your government doesn't want money to leave.
I don't think there is any other (quick) option. The first time it can require up to 24 hours for the first withdrawal and you will have a cap of 80€ for deposits. After that it will be instant and your cap will be raised to 100€ per day and 500€ per month. I don't know if at that point it can raise further.

I personally like Virwox, maybe the fastest for small transactions. You can use Paypal and credit card too. The first time you have to wait up to 48 hours for your withdrawal, but you will obviously receive the amount you bought even if market value changes drastically, and your limit for deposit is 80€. Then it become instant and your limit raise up to 100€ per day and 500€ per 30 days.
@_date: 2013-05-18 11:03:11
If you wish to buy few, you'd better using a platform like these:
 (this is safer if you don't want to use google 2 factor, because you can lock permanently a wallet address to your account, and it only requires 3 confirmations for deposits, so its a lot faster)
 (here shares are a bit cheaper, but you have to register to  to transfer funds, don't worry it is safe even if it doesn't look good).
For big amounts, you could consider posting on bitcointalk forum and buy directly from other people.
@_date: 2013-02-17 21:26:23
It is effective in the sense that every purchase is being traced. In addition, Monti's government introduced the so called "redditometro", which is a system used by our internal revenue service to analyze how much a person spends in comparison with his/her earnings. This two measures combined had the result to lower consistently the average low/middle class expenses (and I'm talking about needed expenses, not shopping or irrelevant things, because the average income is really low and the unemployement rate is rising every day), which is a terrible thing for our country's economy.
