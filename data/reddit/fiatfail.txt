Here is what I would do, if I were to listen to myself:
Every week add a limit order 10-5% below the current price, repeat this for 20 week for $125 per week.
This way you will get hit the spikes and you will catch the flash crashes. 
Also use bitcoin whenever it is possible.

There is so much wrong with this story.....
So "David" aka Ali, bought a deactivated gun(on the "darknet"), and then activated it..  that should take a much skills making a gun from scratch if not more skills..  
Ali could just had bought the gun in a theater/dress-up shop without using an id with cash. 
also look into *operation fast and furious*. 
This story stinks of taking the Germans rights to access the Internet.

You could also use coinbase?
There are other places than circle...  at least 5-6 large companies..

no tis a bitcoin trading strategy. 
I would recommend DCA - and just spend bitcoins like cash.

There are different fees! eg. coinbase takes 1%(AFAIK). 
But coinbase is much easier for the common man.

I think it is kind of funny....   If there was a OneCoin event in Denmark I would probably go there just to destroy them(with words).

@_date: 2016-11-02 18:45:07
I guess that it depends on your location, coinbase.com has a recurring buy feature.
But it might be better to use an exchange(depending on your location)
averaging the price is the smart method to buy into this.

Bitcoin quantity in existence is set *programmatically* and it cannot be changed..

I have actually been following this "bug" for some time. 
In the old days people forgot to add a fee and the transaction still got confirmed. 
@_date: 2016-10-26 18:53:33
 100 blocks... sadly that is somewhat 19 hours... 
@_date: 2016-10-27 17:57:54
I actually think that either you or the sender did something strange.. there was a lot of address re-use and a lot of depending transactions..  This is generally not a typical usage. 
But the blockchain doesn't care if you are a fridge. 
I would recommend a mobile wallet e.g. mycelium or breadwallet
@_date: 2016-05-12 07:55:02
You should spell check the seed... 
Since you have already entered it correct one time.
@_date: 2016-10-26 18:23:52
I would like to see the transaction hash... 
It could be a fee problem... then it would take up to days to confirm...

Coinbase is not some small garage project...  It is a fine place to buy coins... and if you are a noob you can use the vault service for long term storage.
You should use localbitcoins, mycelium or purse.io if you wanted something more privacy oriented. 
Would you expect NYSE(coinbase) to not comply with the law?
@_date: 2016-05-29 19:36:37

My guess: 
We will never get to mine the last satoshis...  within 20-30 years there will be a shift to DPOS(or something similar), we could already do it today if the POW would seemed broken, but I think it is important that the POW will give a fair distribution of wealth in the early days of crypto.

I'm not certain that it is an external bitcoin wallet....   
Either bitcoinwallet is hacked...  or this is an internal bitcoinwallet.com transaction. This is most likely an internal transaction and if it doesn't show up on your account you should contact their support.
This transaction doesn't look like a "hacker" transaction...

I recently had this conversation... 
Mining is a hole other game than just buying bitcoins... If you believe that difficulty would drop after the halving... you might as well buy some old S7 if you believe the difficulty would increase dramatically then you should probably wait for S9(two weeks^tm)(But really just buy bitcoins..)
When you think about how rare a bitcoin is....  not every in Venezuelan can own one.
I would argue that bitcoin is surpassed the happy mining days...  for an example: the volume on localbitcoins is higher than the daily production.

So many will say *No*, But there is an educational aspect to this; 
You wouldn't get a good ROI for a long time, but you would know how the system works. 
You could also *just* run a full node... by doing this you would be able to know that everything is correct and you would also help the network propagate transactions.

Why not use a wallet where you own the private-key/seed? preferably on a smartphone. 
mycelium or breadwallet?

Yes! everyone should store their own coins on their on devices.  The centralist will do anything to keep the system going...  even taking every penny from every bank account.
When you deposit money into a bank it is lost - you might get some of it back if you are lucky.
Isn't it funny that when you loan(deposit) money to the bank you don't get any interest. That seems like a bad deal.

Your method seems correct.. 
You might consider/check if QuadrigaCX can use euroes. 
If QuadrigaCX cannot use euros you could buy at a european exchange to send the directly to QuadrigaCX.
1. Buy coins on kraken.com or coinbase.com or circle.com with €
2. Move coin to QuadrigaCX 
3. Sell coin on QuadrigaCX and transfer to the canadian bank account.

Your premise: people will buy ETH when it is dumped. I would not buy it.
Anyways; if you don't hold the private-key you don't own it.
If you don't own your private-key then you might as well put your money in an European bank.

I guess that World war II was inevitable since the Germans couldn't pay for the penalty of losing the great war. 
I have read some history. Did you know that when Berlin was divided in a Russian side and an allied side. the Russians isolated(blockaded) Berlin from the rest of vest Germany. The Russians would lift the blockade if Russia controlled the currency of Berlin.
