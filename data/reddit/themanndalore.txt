Awesome news, my bet is they'll just settle their futures contracts to this rather than bitcoin itself (allows for questions about finality of trade and hard forks to be thrown to the wayside).  But couple this with the etf and we should see some serious players enter the space soon.

Ethereum is setting up private ledgers for these companies. They're doing the same with the bank of canada..so yes it's Ethereum, but not the public chain.

Most bitcoin doesn't move though, so comparing companies (which theoretically could all sell at that value) to an asset like btc doesn't really work.  The vast majority of BTC just sits in accounts and isn't really traded.  You'd blow through just about every order book in the world if you tried to sell off 1% of the supply of BTC

Block 1 - Alice has 1 btc, Bob has 2 btc.
Block 2 - Alice has 2 btc, Bob has 2 btc. 
Fork happens
Block 3a- Alice has 3 btc, bob has 2 btc
Block 3b - Alice has 2 btc, bob has 3 btc
Now with a fork, the next block 4 can choose which block 3 to include as the block 3 (since only 1 is allowed).  Most of the time, the block that does not get included just goes away (like if 3a has one software update and 3b doesn't, 3b will just go away).  But in cases of BCH and ETC, you have a block 4a and 4b and the two separate chains continue.

Be patient!!  It will come...unfortunately the USD to BTC and back options are still pretty slow
