Bitcoin Core is open source and any changes in the technology occur through consensus, such as soft forks, like second layer changes, or hard forks, and thus are not controlled (centralized) like you detail it.

Invest in a HW wallet. In fact, make it 3. And store them in different locations. Fees are calculated based on transaction size, not amount transferred. Set a mediumish fee and it should be transferred within a few days. 
I’d all suggest maybe figuring your total wealth in bitcoin vs other assets and maybe reallocating some gains into fiat. Not saying Hodling isn’t the best strategy for insuring your value increase, but if selling a small fraction of your gains into fiat and using it in your everyday life to accomplish your other goals is possible, I’d seize the opportunity.

This is the real point. Very slim chance that if bitcoin dips for good, any other fork would succeed. A lot are pre-mined “investment” schemes, and the others are hard forks from Bitcoin, from my understanding.

By withdraw, I assume you mean that you can take USD or CAD out. It's as simple as connecting your bank account to that.
If you mean transferring to a cold wallet or paper wallet or another e-wallet, the answer is yes. 
If the first, you can close out your position in bitcoin to a position in USD or other fiat currency at anytime with a sell order for your bitcoin to said fiat's exchange rate. 
If the latter, you can move your bitcoin on the exchange from GDAX to whatever address you want, whether a hardware, or cold wallet, or an ewallet, or a paper wallet, simply by logging into GDAX.com and moving it.

Bitcoin can be a different asset and have a different use for any participant. That’s the reason behind the technology. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 09:17:07
I think it's been explained many times.
People who buy shorts in futures contracts can/perhaps have been buying bitcoin for awhile. And these people can then sell all of their bitcoin at once. And if these people happen to be the whales, their selling pressure could trigger stop-loss signals in non-HODLers accounts that can then trigger more selling pressure. Then you wake up freak out and sell half. And bam.

To expand on this, if you weren’t inclined to allowing each of your partners having full and sole control of their share, then you could have them sent to a wallet that utilizes 2-of-2, 3-of-3, or, if you all trust each other not to collude, a 2-of-3 multisig transaction. This way no bitcoin can change ownership (expenses, payroll, or cashing out), unless the required amount of signatures are produced. 
Personally, I see multisig wallets, even for single entity ownership, as the bitcoin standard for small business. I just think it’s safer to have a hot wallet for daily transacting, and then just like a teller empties his or her drawer periodically, your business’ hot wallet’s transactions could be consolidated into a single, multisig account. 
I just have a layman’s understanding of the possibilities, but I know there are MANY ways to set up different types of business payment structures utilizing Bitcoin, and further out on the second layer, those possibilities can be developed by YOU, curtailed to your business’ unique needs.

Coinbase is as unsafe as every other place on the internet.

A) selling it for your expenses
B) convincing the companies invoicing you to accept bitcoin

All an application requires is for two parties to use it. Bitcoin started off solo. Then one person downloaded and joined. Then another. Lightning Network, despite being developed by more than one person, started the same way. First there was 1 channel. Then 3. Then 5. It expands.
Instead of innovating from the center out, you can innovate from the very edge. From the end user to the other.
