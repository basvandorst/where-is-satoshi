Leftists in Europe aren’t hiding at all, they are loud, they protest almost everyday and damage public and private properties, try to intimidate/bully whoever tries to think critically.
Antifas come from here originally.
So I highly doubt leftists are hiding round here.

What you call bullshit is what is the context of my country for at least 40 years. The reality I live in might sound like bullshit in your ears, I have no idea where you come from, but sometimes reality checks happens. Hey here feminists complain and mob about the sexist air conditionning in the workplace...
9 Millions unemployed, 15 millions of poors, state debt over 2 Trillions, but leftists are more concerned about how to tax the middle class \(or what is left of it\) to give African and Middle eastern who break the law to get in on welfare. 
Immigrants bringing crime and fear to women in some neighborhoods but left wing politicians are concerned about ''mansplaining'' and ''manspreading''.
Every other day there is a left wing mob turning into violence, and damages to public/private properties. \(guess who's gonna pay for that\)
But yeah I'm the one referring to bullshit buddy.

Claiming to be anti\-fascism and acting like fascists is somewhat counter productive. But hey, they are left wing so they are is the camp of ''good'' ;\)

That’s right. I don’t know why that guy want to make it look like the paper printed by the federal reserve has any value since it’s not backed by gold anymore by choice (maybe Nixon was under pressure from the families who own the fed)

The politically correct left, the intersectional feminists, lgbtqiaxyz, the antifas, are all leftists to an extent.
And it doesn’t change the fact wether you like it or not, that in Europe and in France particularly, they are fucking the country up with all there whining and behavior, word policing, thinking policing, bullying, and so on.
Call that misleading all you like but they are still destroying my country.

By the way downvoting won’t change the facts stated above.
