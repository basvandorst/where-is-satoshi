if you can hold it without needing it back quickly, buy bitcoin and then use it to buy an altcoin with high daily volume, and not in a downward direction. think lots of buying &amp; selling. place for sale double the purchase price. walk away and check every once a while. when the sell order goes through, be it days weeks or months, withdraw your 1000 and keep the rest to continue with a new high volume altcoin.

we already made it to the moon. now we have distant galaxies in our sites. patience is the key to profit. quick gains = quick fall. slow and steady is key to success

crypto back loans, such as nexo. loans on securities. that way im borrowing on my balance, not selling. i get cash and keep my bitcoins in collateral. no taxes. you can do the same with stocks

I see an endless future of ups and downs with more long term ups. Just remember this, no one knows what will happen tomorrow. Price could be up or down. In 10+ years from now it'll be higher priced than today, that im sure of. Set a sell price goal, set an alarm for that price and walk away
