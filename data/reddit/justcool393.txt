Coin money only references money that is backed by metals (i.e. your coins). 
The Legal Tender Act of 1862 gave the power to the federal government to create paper money. The constitutionality of this was upheld in Knox v. Lee and Parker v. Davis and more strongly upheld in Juilliard v. Greenman 13 years later.


This isn't a power delegated to the states though (in fact, it's explicitly denied to states). States can't decide what they want to be legal tender, but the federal government can. Article I Section 10 only says that states do not have the power to decide what is legal tender and make their own (aside from gold/silver).
This is a power reserved solely to the federal government.
Some things I also want to clear up:
* [Private businesses/people do not have to accept currency or coins in exchange for services]( unless a state law says otherwise.
* [Foreign gold or silver coins are not legal tender for debts]( This means that not all gold/silver can be used to pay for something.

Beforehand, I want to make it clear that I have no idea who is downvoting you.


I don't disagree, but I'm almost positive the agency that developed a fundamental backbone of Bitcoin knows how it works mostly, even at a simplistic level.


Inflation isn't always a bad thing. For example, take 3 money systems, one with 100% inflation (2x every year), 0% inflation and 50% deflation (1/2 every year).
If I take out a $10000 loan, in the inflationary currency, I will have owed less when adjusted for inflation. 
In the 0% inflation, I would have owed the same amount.
But with the 50% deflation, I would owe more giving me no incentive to invest and just to sit on my money.
Also, remember that Bitcoin is still inflationary, and will be for a while as new coins are created.


It'll effectively squash it like a bug. If "Bitcoin is illegal" were true, it would turn off many, many people to it. Who wants to be in fear of getting locked up in prison all the time, having to basically "move underground"? 


The blockchain, which keeps a log of all transactions. If you get access to the address, then you can get access to a pseudo-anonymous log of all of their transactions.




Who (that isn't living underground or selling stuff that is illegal) would want to use that? Mom and dad aren't going to know how to use Tor, or even really care all that much.
Also, Tor didn't keep out the government from Silk Road when the former came knocking.




There are many more factors to using drugs. Firstly, I will agree that the promotional "drugs are bad" stuff has mostly failed. Though, the thing is none of my peers are pressuring me to use Bitcoin, offering to give me my first centi-Bitcoin for free, etc, etc.




I know you and a lot more people here and around the world do (there are very valid complaints, the government does suck and is largely inefficient in many ways), but a government is more than just a financial system. There are many more components to a government such as judicial, trade, agreements with other countries, etc, etc.




I only thought the part you were actually trolling was the whole "Hail Bitcoin!" and the whole "charred ashes of America" thing. I rescind that. Anyway, I believe someone can be an anarchist and advocate for it, but I just don't see how it is feasible in the long term. History repeats itself, and governments always seem to rise out from where there isn't one.
There are many examples throughout even recent history where after a dictator gets overthrown, they just get another dictator that does largely the same things.
Also, thanks for debating without resorting to attacks. It's really nice to see that. :)

No, I'm saying that Article 10 has nothing to do with the federal government. Article 10 specifically starts with "No state shall".
This article only references powers that states do not have. These powers that the states do not have are given to the federal government.
Since this seems to be hard to understand, let's create an example here. Let's create 2 different entites for example here. Our entites are going to be called "Federal" and "State".
The hierarchy goes top down, from Federal to individual. Now, in the Constitution, most powers are granted to individual states (as outlined in the 10^th Amendment).
States can make their own laws. These laws apply to individuals and to the state, but not to the federal government or any other states.
Federal laws (and the Constitution) apply to all states. Article I Section 10 denies permission to the states to make anything but gold/silver a tender in payments, but this does not bar the federal government/Congress from making something legal tender.

If Bitcoin is going to 'destroy all governments', wouldn't the government do something other than supposedly pay shills to discredit it? 
It would be really easy for some governments to squash bitcoin if they really wanted to. They haven't yet, and I doubt it's because they can't or don't understand it.

Are you telling me that all of the government workers that work in economics, work with money on a daily basis, and know the history of various money systems collectively are too stupid to grasp Bitcoin, but anybody with half a shred of technical knowledge can?


Here is a few ways that I thought up:
1. **Legally.** Make it illegal to trade bitcoin, make merchants not be able to accept it without prosecution.
2. **Technically.** Block access to mining pools, resources about obtaining bitcoins, etc. We could go steps further.
3. **By spreading FUD.** Tarnishing the reputation would be easy enough. It doesn't have the best one right now anyway.


Maybe, but it will be a niche of a niche of a niche that will constantly be under fear of attack. Being a shadow figure isn't something most people would trust.

State laws cannot overrule federal laws. Deny takes precedence over allow (and allow is the default, since the alternative is much worse). If the federal government denies something, the states cannot say "yes, it's legal". The Constitution explicitly forbids the states from issuing their own currency. It does not say anything about the federal government, as said earlier.


They would require to give legal tender (paper money or coins).


You're right. That's why we have a standardized money system in the United States. Because otherwise it'd be a pain in the ass to transfer value from one state to another, and internationally as well. 


Yes they do. This is a "jackdaw is a crow" situation. Do you live in Washington or the US? It's not an either/or, it's both. I live in both the US, Washington and the city of Vancouver. Since my Vancouver, WA laws apply, does the Washington laws not apply? No.

It really is hard to be secure enough; there are way too many weaknesses with people. Plenty of people aren't, and judging by how often a 'my bitcoins were stolen' post appears on here, I would rather trust the bank who employ teams of people to make sure my money is secure.


Except to where you can't exchange bitcoins for goods/services.




But with many currencies, the market is stable enough where exchanging a few thousand units of currency for another currency doesn't cause the market to wildly fluctuate.

The amounts are usually less than the transaction fee. Plus, a lot of people (myself included) really don't want to go through the hassle of linking a bank account to an exchange just to claim $1.
**About tipping in general...**
Personally, I haven't sent any bitcoins to the eater address, but I don't think giving people tips is the best way to curate content creation. Look at reddit now. People are already karma-whoring in the defaults and stuff, and those are just internet points. I can't trade my karma for USD, BTC, stock shares or reddit notes, yet people still want to get those points like their lives depend on it.
When people get in to this mindset of "how can I get the most money out of this", it can ruin a lot of things socially. This is why sites like [the StackExchange network]( have basically said that there is no way in hell that they are going to add tips or any monetary incentives in to the platform.
Imagine you were talking to your friend in person, and you said something that made them think or something they really liked. Wouldn't you think it's insulting if the person opens up their wallet and hands you a quarter?
**On scarcity:**
The amount is so small that it won't matter, and even if it did, no one on an exchange are looking at reddit posts (especially and saying, "yup, just sent 500 bits to the eater address, let's sell for a little bit higher".
Also, if a lot of coins were sent to that address, people would wonder why that address had a lack of faith, and we could possibly see dumping. This is just speculation though.

As I said before, I would report the exploit without the reward, but ultimately that's not my call to make.
\* They should look in to it regardless, but they don't seem to be doing that here.

I think the sell pressure is caused by the positive feedback loop that's been created by the price drop.

Or Circle gets hacked (if I understand correctly). But I admit that doesn't happen often. It has happened though.


Or someone gets the card information. For example, if someone finds the card in the mail or something like that. In fact, many systems have anti-fraud protections in place to automatically block transactions that come from far away places from where transactions usually take place.

This seems very similar to snail mail, which has been almost already superseded by email, because email was superior in almost every way (barring physical objects or other ways of message).
The thing is, what you are proposing would cost less to spam through your email service than through snail mail. If I wanted to send 9,999,999 pieces of snail mail out, it would cost me* $2,609,999.74, which doesn't include the price of the printing of the letters.
10 bits is (at the time of writing) $0.0023569. Sending 9,999,999 emails would cost the company a measly $23,569. This also would spam the blockchain, meaning higher fees for everybody else to include blocks (which would over time raise the price of the mail, but it'd be hard to guess how that would factor in). I shouldn't need to wait 10 minutes to receive a stupid email. I have better uses of my time than just waiting for some computers to finish some cryptography operations. 
Also, if I want to send something to an email address that I haven't sent to before, I shouldn't need to pay someone else for them to receive my crap.
Emails already bounce, get lost in translation and other stuff like that all the time. We don't need more of someone complaining why she couldn't find that company email that has been looking for because they didn't want to use the 10 bit fee to send.
On whitelists, they are in most cases worse than spam blacklists which are already in place and are evolving over time.

But how reddit works makes this not going to work. Unless goes inactive for 3 months or steps down as moderator, the next person in line for this wouldn't be able to remove him.
And reddit admins won't remove him otherwise. There might be other cases, but that's more like privatizing the sub in exchange for a demand or something like that.

Yeah, I don't think that. It could very well stay at $200 forever. It could be worth millions (very unlikely) or it could be worth ~$0 (unlikely, but more likely than the other option).


1. Everyday people call it a ponzi scheme (regardless of the validity of the claim)
2. Someone in the bitcoin space is either shown to be insolvent, is hacked, etc, etc every few days.
3. **People are mostly fine with what works now.**
Those are a few reasons, and if I gave it more than 30 seconds of thought, I can probably think of more.


I would agree with that. There are plenty of problems with using that as a reason, but you're trying to preach to the choir of people that are mostly pro-Bitcoin (obviously, this is the Bitcoin subreddit after all).


I'm confused by this logic. Right now, I don't believe Bitcoin has succeeded yet. I think it's in this phase where we are still needing to see if it'll succeed (obviously the definition of success is subjective, but you get my point).
Also, you can still fail after you succeed.


You might get more (probably the same as this one and the other ones) or better responses if you post this on an "anti-Bitcoin" forum such as or the likes.
But in all reality, there are a lot of rational arguments against Bitcoin (just like there are rational arguments for it, of course). Just because you may not like them doesn't mean they don't exist.

Well, the whole thing isn't in view, so I assume there is a company advertising this or another part of the ad we aren't currently seeing. I think there could be more than one interpretation of this ad, as it could either be saying:
1. "Keep it centralized, unlike that Bitcoin stuff over there!"
2. "Keep it centralized with us, and don't have all of your stuff spread out everywhere."
I really don't think that many people care that much about currency centralization though except for a niche group.
By that ammo comment, I meant to come across as "why say that decentralization is inferior if you want to promote a decentralized method of payment".
But I see what you mean as it is a weird ad. did you happen to capture the name of the company/organization that was advertising this?
@_date: 2015-03-18 21:53:37


Ideally, yes. But it seems that for it to gain a good amount of massive adoption, it's going to require it. Plus, not many people care about having no middlemen.


At the moment. It could go up or down either way depending on miners and it'll probably go up once the block reward halves.

There is a checklist for this. I didn't make it, I just filled it out. So...
Your post advocates a

approach to fighting spam. Your idea will not work. Here is why it won't work. (One or more of the following may apply to your particular idea, and it may have other flaws which used to vary from state to state before a bad federal law was passed.)
( ) Spammers can easily use it to harvest email addresses
(X) Mailing lists and other legitimate email uses would be affected
( ) No one will be able to find the guy or collect the money
( ) It is defenseless against brute force attacks
(X) It will stop spam for two weeks and then we'll be stuck with it
(X) Users of email will not put up with it
( ) Microsoft will not put up with it
( ) The police will not put up with it
( ) Requires too much cooperation from spammers
(X) Requires immediate total cooperation from everybody at once
(X) Many email users cannot afford to lose business or alienate potential employers
( ) Spammers don't care about invalid addresses in their lists
( ) Anyone could anonymously destroy anyone else's career or business
Specifically, your plan fails to account for
( ) Laws expressly prohibiting it
( ) Lack of centrally controlling authority for email
( ) Open relays in foreign countries
( ) Ease of searching tiny alphanumeric address space of all email addresses
(X) Asshats
( ) Jurisdictional problems
(X) Unpopularity of weird new taxes
(X) Public reluctance to accept weird new forms of money
( ) Huge existing software investment in SMTP
( ) Susceptibility of protocols other than SMTP to attack
( ) Willingness of users to install OS patches received by email
( ) Armies of worm riddled broadband-connected Windows boxes
(X) Eternal arms race involved in all filtering approaches
( ) Extreme profitability of spam
( ) Joe jobs and/or identity theft
( ) Technically illiterate politicians
( ) Extreme stupidity on the part of people who do business with spammers
( ) Dishonesty on the part of spammers themselves
( ) Bandwidth costs that are unaffected by client filtering
(X) Outlook
and the following philosophical objections may also apply:
(X) Ideas similar to yours are easy to come up with, yet none have ever been shown practical
( ) Any scheme based on opt-out is unacceptable
( ) SMTP headers should not be the subject of legislation
( ) Blacklists suck
(X) Whitelists suck
( ) We should be able to talk about Viagra without being censored
( ) Countermeasures should not involve wire fraud or credit card fraud
(X) Countermeasures should not involve sabotage of public networks
( ) Countermeasures must work if phased in gradually
(X) Sending email should be free
(X) Why should we have to trust you and your servers?
( ) Incompatiblity with open source or open source licenses
( ) Feel-good measures do nothing to solve the problem
( ) Temporary/one-time email addresses are cumbersome
( ) I don't want the government reading my email
( ) Killing them that way is not slow and painful enough

Is pissing people off a good strategy to get people to want to use bitcoin? Do we want the thought that goes in to a decision maker's mind when they hear about Bitcoin and merchants to be spammers that don't actually purchase anything when they finally get their way, and if they get called out on it cite a stupid reason like "the button wasn't big enough" or "there wasn't a discount for using it"?

Why? If you create a little, no one will notice because the system is so large at this point. It'd also be really hard to rollback the blockchain at this point.

Oh, I agree. I wish bits would be suitable but some people decided it would be useful as a subunit.

That's why we're all running OpenOffice and using the Linux desktop, right?

The first two are practically the same story. That's probably a reason some doubt you. I didn't really look in to it though much.

If I may ask, why? I don't give a tip or whatever and if they want to save it or don't care for it, take it back.

I'm pretty sure credit/debit cards are an innovation.

I really wasn't trying to make an argument for or against the video itself, but rather just say that this isn't the guy you or I really want to associate themselves with.

Man, they should have at least put effort in to it. If there is an almost similar quote, but with the places switched around. *sigh*

Molyneux is also a guy who actually asked the question of "why do women date assholes". I had to force myself to watch that video a while back and it was terrible.

Hey, no problem. I didn't mean to sound antagonizing or anything. Have a nice day. :)

Sorry, 25 cents. Still doesn't buy anyone anything useful.

The thing is, what that user is doing is probably not legal in many places.
[From Wikipedia](


I'm not about to dig up Europe's age of consent laws, but I'm pretty sure it's 18 for this case. Regardless of the legality of it though, I'm pretty sure you forgot to respond to my other argument against the whole 'stealing isn't as bad as murder, so why should you care' thing.

Take it back to @_date: 2015-02-21 17:09:56


No, that's not how it works. Using your analogy, I could justify almost any crime in existence.
"Stealing isn't as bad as murder. Why should I get in trouble for stealing?"
Also, just because you can legally do something, doesn't mean you should.

No, I'm not denying either. It's of little concern to really anyone though. I know it's a tired saying, but if you're not transferring a bunch of money to terrorists knowingly, you really have nothing to worry about.

It is a copypasta. Some guy in during the period where it was a default said something like
"Im not a professional quote maker but...
'In this moment, I am euphoric not because of any phony gods blessing, but because I am enlightened by my intelligence'".

This is where it can be confusing for many people. The protocol is referred to as Bitcoin, while the currency is also referred to in the same way, just with different casing. It's also problematic in titles and in start of sentences, due to how the rules of English and many similar languages operate. Maybe it should have been separated when talking about it, but I don't think there is going to be much that can be done now.
I also get the whole "don't use bit coin" thing, but in the grand scheme of things, I don't think many really are going to care all that much, and people are just going to tell people to stop trying to correct them when they know what they meant.
