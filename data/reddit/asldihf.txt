This is the guy that didn't understand the appeal of Apple for 30 years either.

A buddy texted me this the other day....*"satoshi went into hiding after someone suggested that wikileaks take bitcoin since the gov froze all their assets. satoshi immediately posted that Wikileaks has kicked the hornets nest and they will come for us all. that was his last post before vanishing.  Trump is secretly working with assange even though Jeff sessions says he wants assange as a distraction. I bet he already has immunity, same with Snowden.  assange tweeted the other day a cryptic message and an mia video paper planes which explains in the song lyrics that people have visas that are trying to flee the country. that s why all these planes are being diverted and strange power outages.  it's no coincidence that a lot of famous people and politicians are being outed for sex stuff wait til they get to the pedo stuff 9000 sealed indictments that the media won't cover.   the Fed is going down hard."*...does that qualify LOL?

I don't think they own the tether they just trade it.

No one knows anything but IMHO stay in BTC.  To me the rest of those are like investing in oil before the automobile is invented.   The only exception might be Ripple (again only IMHO) which American Express and some other financials appear to be actively planning to use for settlement.  Ripple should also jump (possibly substantially) when support for it is added on Trezor and on GDAX.  EDIT: Misspelling

They understand that we're 2 years from a new world order in currency and they will do anything they can to try to control it.  I will never ever buy or use that garbage alt-coin.

1) There are only 13m (16-3m lost) 
2) There are multiple ETF's coming that will need to accumulate. 
3) Goldman Crypto desk in early Jan.
4) We're still so far ahead of the curb.  Crypto won't be the global standard for another 24-36 months from now.

I would submit a new ticket every day or every other day on both the website and via support   Call them as well - you'll be on hold for probably 2 hours at least but once someone answers they'll be able to provide you a case # and escalate you to tier 2 support.  Don't expect anything more than that on the phone as their phone answerers are poorly trained and have no authority to fix anything money related.  My experience is they'll take a couple weeks but their real techs will eventually fix whatever the issue is.   I think they've been 2-3 weeks behind since Thanksgiving.

This was LTC not BTC..

Anything you can do for a transaction sent FROM Coinbase to a wallet?   I have had a LTC transaction in pending for 11 days.   No idea why as other LTC transitions have completed in minutes if not seconds..   Or just have to wait 2 weeks?

What were they using before?

I got some transactions through at 140 sat/b in 3 hours this morning.  Non-Segwit account to Segwit account.

I had a bank manager at Wells Fargo warn me that he had been notified that WF was considering no longer accepting wire transfers from Coinbase.   EDIT:  Not trying to spread FUD.   Conversation occurred at a Wells Branch.  Young guy might be BS but he seemed earnest.

Yeah welcome to the club.  15 days now 'pending'.   I've been on the phone with Coinbase support twice now.   They can't explain it or do anything about it.

CashApp is an expensive place to buy BTC and limits total withdrawal amounts you can do weekly, but yes you can withdraw to any other wallet.
@_date: 2019-10-09 13:52:42
This is not accurate

I buy a lot of things on Amazon with bitcoin using pulse.io.

If you could send money to a URL, like redcross.btc or childrenshospital.btc something like that.  Then a name service resolves the URL into a bitcoin address.
