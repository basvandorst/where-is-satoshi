The difference is that if bitcoin is regulated now rather than later, the regulation will likely be much more destructive to the ecosystem and less people will care because they don't use it anyway. If we show that there is no immediate cause for concern, the ecosystem can continue to grow and new use-cases can be discovered without running into excessive regulation.

Interesting what they did with steem is that they put a requirement in the mining algorithm that whoever generates the block also needs to know the private key of the address receiving the reward for the block. This discourages mining pools and botnets because you'd have to give out the key to each end point miner.

It would be nice if there was a hierarchical upstream/downstream workflow for bitcoin vs altcoins (which just fork bitcoin). It's a shame that the dichotomy between bitcoin vs altcoin maximalism basically prevents this.

Most likely all altcoins and bitcoin would benefit from being more collaborative.

Reminder: As strange as it may seem, inflation and deflation are not (always) mutually exclusive.
When people talk about "inflation", usually they are talking about inflation in the prices of consumer goods. This means things like cars, tv sets, food etc.
When people talk about "deflation", usually they're talking about deflation in the prices of capital goods. Examples of this would be machinery, houses, land etc.
The relationship of the prices of these different types of goods depends on the amount of savings in the economy and people's time preference (e.g. the amount of time people are willing to wait for a return on an investment vs spending everything in the here and now).

There are plenty of instances where imitating something can devalue the original but that isn't considered stealing. For example if someone where to open a donut shop in a town without any donut shops, he might have a lot of success and customers. If a second person were to see his success and decide to open a second donut shop, is he "stealing" his idea? Is he "stealing" customers from the original donut shop?

In theory it should be possible in the near future for an exchange to operate as a lightning node, meaning your funds sit are in a lightning channel owned by you, and you simply make a lightning micropayment every time you sell some BTC. This way the funds are always recoverable if the exchange does down/rogue.

I think it's important to remember that this is a community decision and not one enforced by developers or anyone else.
Forked code has existed for months which increases the blocksize in various ways. We could have a larger blocksize today if everyone just decided to switch over to one of these.
However, since the people who want to do that are a minority, they are currently choosing to remain with the current branch of Bitcoin. They could also fork the chain and we would have a similar situation to Ethereum Classic., but they choose not to because  the benefit of staying with the rest of the Bitcoin community is greater than that of having larger blocks sooner.

Not really true. No information about the individual transactions will appear on the chain which means no hashes or proof of a particular transaction will be visible. Only the final state after all transactions in the channel have been completed will be visible on the chain. Whether this is useful for Mr Dotcom or not depends on what he's using them for.

Using an actual firewall would seem like a better solution though surely? 
@_date: 2016-04-05 15:04:29
The first places this could be implemented would be for any sites which can only operate at the moment by you actually sending your coin to them. For example payment processors like coinbase, exchanges, gambling sites etc.
Right now you send your money to coinbase, and coinbase maintains a balance for each user which may or may not be backed up by actual bitcoin. If you want to "send" bitcoin with coinbase from one person to another they simply increment and decrement the balances accordingly.
In future instead of sending the money to coinbase, you could put it in a lightning hub, allowing you to send transactions via coinbase to any other coinbase customer without any risk of coinbase stealing or losing your funds. The advantage would be 0/very low fees and fast transactions. The disadvantage would be that coinbase would still see all transactions that they process, and that if coinbase went down you would have to manually remove your coins from the lightning hub and go back to transacting on the blockchain again. However this is better than losing access to your funds entirely.

The good thing is there's basically no reason (that I can see) for exchanges like coinbase not to switch to becoming LN hubs after it becomes available rather than holding the funds directly. You can kind of see LN as basically like multisig on crack. Coinbase would be able to offer the same service of making instant off-blockchain transactions but they wouldn't have to hold or control your funds directly.
@_date: 2016-08-11 12:27:16
tl;dr in the future exchanges won't need to hold (crypto) funds because they will be held in LN payment channels, with the exchange just acting as the routing hub.
@_date: 2016-04-10 19:29:00
I have a feeling that the LN won't resemble a fully p2p network any time soon. The first instances of Lightning being used will be for websites which traditionally would've held your funds such as services like Coinbase,  exchanges, merchant sites, gambling sites etc. Over time these services will create lightning channels between them allowing their users to send funds between eachother. At this point the LN starts to resemble the model of the internet itself, with large services providers and normal users being leaf nodes. This has pros and cons. One can see some opportunities for censorship and monitoring of transactions in a system like this, however eventually I imagine they could be dealt with.
@_date: 2016-04-26 19:35:56
This would be a cool way to gamble. Representatives from various mining pools could build a transaction together which collectively creates a huge fee and then one of the pools would get it.
@_date: 2018-01-30 17:11:31
Just create the transaction but don't send it to the rest of the network. Keep it on your local computer, but work on mining a block with the TX inside it.
Its still possible that if your block gets ophaned then the tx could be included by another miner, because they've seen the it in the orphaned block. But otherwise nobody can mine a transaction they don't know about.

As more people want to use bitcoin this will necessitate that the price increases. Especially as people start to use it in their lives for everyday things and holding it as savings rather than speculation (we know the number of people doing this now is nonzero although invariably they are doing it at least partially on an ideological basis). The question is whether it will ever be adopted enough to increase the price above the 2013 peak by an order of magnitude (as expected in such a bubble). My personal belief is yes, but the question of how that will look and how long it will take is still very uncertain.
@_date: 2018-01-17 09:33:36
There is inherent value in the technology and its ability to make cross border payments, and store value in a way where accounts can't be frozen and payments are truly final. There is value in having the best developers and network effect, and the most proven resistance to attacks.
That doesn't mean that the current valuation on the market is anywhere near representative of that underlying value. If anything it could represent the future potential value, but without also representing the real risks of future problems such as more coordinated attacks or obsoletion.
The price can return to $20k but only IF everyone works hard to make the bitcoin network and marketplace the best it can be, and if it wins out against competition which will only continue to increase (although the true competition is still hard to discern against the noise of so many pump and dump schemes ongoing at the moment).
@_date: 2018-01-22 21:46:27
AFAIK this is the case, but I'm not an expert on lightning and there might be a way to mitigate this. It's a good idea to use lightning as a hot wallet and keep cold storage in regular addresses for now.
The lightning network clients which are coming out will also keep track of opening channels, and finding the paths and choosing which channel to send a transaction on - so most likely it will also take care to make sure that the channels don't get empty on either side when receiving payments.

@_date: 2018-01-07 14:23:02
I have some questions about LN which maybe aren't being asked by the rest of the posts here:
* How can liquidity be balanced across the network to make sure that it's always possible to make a payment without intermediate channels being empty?
* What's the risk of attacks? Hubs will always have to have their private key online in order to forward payments. They can't lose client funds in this case, but might charge higher fees to mitigate the risk of hacks. Endpoints need to be online in order to check for fraud (although their private key can be offline, in a hardware wallet etc). What's the chances of attacks happening there the user gets DDOSsed when trying to submit the newer version of the TXN in the case of fraud?
* How likely are "watchtowers" going to be used? Doesn't the necessity of using watchtowers make the system more complicated? If a watchtower provider colludes with an attacker, this could also be a worst case scenario.

The problem with using alts is you need to store your wealth in them in order to avoid the fee. The future outlook of alts value is more uncertain, especially eth which is not designed to have the properties of a hard currency like bitcoin is.
Making smaller payments with an alt was actually what litecoin was designed for. But this solution is more of a stop-gap in my opinion.

It's debatable. Stability and predictability are probably more important, which will hopefully happen eventually as BTC starts to grow and it becomes less about speculation and more about actually using it.
The mainstream economic view is that slight inflation is good for the economy because it gives people a reason to spend their money, causing more people to have jobs to make the things that they buy, and keeping the money circulating. The alternative view is that artificially forcing a currency to inflate actually just causes a shift from long term investments towards a short-term orientated, consumer-driven economy, and encourages taking on debt which can lead to bigger problems in the future.

Even if you assume that the price will keep rising as fast as it has in the last couple years (which it certainly can't do forever), there would be no point in holding onto the bitcoin for it to become valuable if you never actually get around to spending it on something. Different people have different 'time preferences'. Some look at it and say "wow i just made $2000, I can finally buy that computer i wanted". Others say "If I wait a few more years I might be able to afford a nice car". Others think "well I'm tight on cash right now and the price could be in a short-term bubble and may have a big correction coming, so I'll sell off a bit".
Or else it could just be that buying a few things here and there for $10 doesn't have a big impact on your overall balance because you have so much.
But of course nothing keeps going up forever, although it can continue to rise in value slowly, if the global economy keeps growing at faster than the rate of new bitcoin being created, and if bitcoin isn't eventually replaced by another currency.

One theory is that miners are stuffing blocks with their own spam txs, since they pay the fees to themselves anyway. This would bid up the average fee and give more fees from the rest of the transactions, without having to pay the fees for doing the spamming.
Proving it isn't easy though.

Bitcoin is currently correcting from an over-exuberant market. Where should the bottom of the correction be? 10000? 7000? 5000? 1000? The fact is, nobody knows. How long will it take before it starts to reach 20K levels again? Will it ever reach this level again? Nobody knows.

IMO most of the TX volume was transactions to, from and between exchanges. People don't mind $30 fees when buying $10000 of bitcoin. Exchanges also don't have a big incentive to implement optimisation such as using segwit, or batching transations, and would rather charge their user a high bitcoin fee than risk the TX getting stuck and having to spend time supporting them.
@_date: 2018-01-29 08:32:36
I sent 5 sats / byte and it got confirmed in 4 hours. 1$ fee with many inputes. And that wasn't a segwit address (I was moving my coins to segwit).

First problem with this attack is that the target could be outsourcing the broadcasting of the new TX to a third party, who is unknown to the attacker.
The second problem is that if the attack fails, the target would be able to create a TX which takes all BTC in the channel for themselves (ie. the attackers money, as well as their own money).
It does mean that it's a good idea to make sure that there is always some funds on both sides of the channel.

Sadly stability in bitcoin can't last too long before people start actually using it, pushing the price up, and eventually starting another massive bubble.

Are miners in pools really deciding what transactions to include in the block though? Or is the pool operator just handing them the header with an empty nonce field, and the merkel root of the transactions (which would allow you to calculate the block hash without knowing the full block you were mining)?

People can post whatever they want - the question is why did it get upvoted?
@_date: 2018-01-30 15:47:39
Other way around.
The pool operator includes his own transactions, with the fee going back to himself. He doesn't send the tx onto the P2P network, so other pools don't know about the tx and can't mine them.
I'm not saying this is actually happening, it's just a theory. But if it is happening, and it's succesfully causing higher fees, then it's a problem which should be considered.

"In Blocks We Trust"
@_date: 2017-12-24 14:22:57
Running a full node allows you to check that the blocks that miners are producing follow the rules of the bitcoin protocol. With many people running nodes, they can assign a higher value to coins on a fork of the chain which follows the rules than one that doesn't. Miners will mine on the fork where the reward coins are most valued.
With everyone running SPV nodes, there is no way for the market to know which fork follows which set of rules. Therefor all nodes will just assume the longest chain is the most valid, even if miners are colluding to, for example, mint more coins than they're supposed to.

Seems that most people are completely misunderstanding this and getting the wrong idea. Not sure if this is because of the video or just because of the way it's been explained elsewhere.
LN isnt a tab or a gift card or anything. I'd rather think of LN as just a faster hot wallet.
Right now I have some bitcoin in cold storage which is hard to spend, and a smaller amount of bitcoin in a hot wallet on my phone. With LN, I could replace this hotwallet with a wallet that supports LN. When I transfer funds from cold storage to the hot wallet, the wallet software should handle opening channels with available nodes on the LN itself, allowing me to spend the funds in the hot wallet without having to go via the blockchain. When sending funds the LN tries to find a path via various nodes and channels to the right person I want to pay. If someone pays me I can already spend the funds on LN again right away.
It should also be possible to spend funds in an LN wallet directly to an address that isn't on the LN via a gateway.
Therefore by placing funds in an LN wallet I wouldn't say you're really "pre-funding" or "opening a tab". You're basically just putting it in a faster wallet. The private key, and therefore the bitcoin is still on the device that runs the wallet, it's just easier and faster to spend.

Depends on the state of the mempool. I usually put a 20-50c fee and get confirmed within a couple blocks. But only during quiet times (which is still the majority of times).
There seems to be periodic times during large price movements or politically "interesting" times when suddenly there are an insane amount of txns coming in and puts up the avervge transaction fees and messes up wallets' fee estimation algorithms. I'm not sure if this is caused by spam or not but it seems that outside these times the real usage of bitcoin is fairly low still.

This doesn't prove that its as secure or decentralized as bitcoin for the same level of scale. The problem is we don't have a good metric for this tradeoff. Bitcoin needs to be as decentralized as possible so that it can't be manipulated by large actors such as corporations or governments. IMO its long-term value is extremely limited without that property. Online payments that can be censored and controlled is already a saturated market.

With extra coins being minted, I mean including transactions with zero inputs, but nonzero outputs. Maybe I misunderstand how SPV works, but AFAIK it provides a proof via merkle path that a particular transaction is in a block. But it doesn't prove that the block itself doesn't contain invalid transactions, or that the UTXO came from a transaction that itself was valid.

2016 was ok because it was going up more steadily. If we pretend alts don't exits for the moment, high fees basically are a sign that the infrastructure is not in place to support the high level of users pouring into the system.

Due to miner centralization, it's possible for miners to include fake txns and pay the fee back to themselves. It puts average fees up and tricks wallets into recommending higher fees. It wouldn't explain why manual low-fee transactions aren't getting confirmed though, so I'm stil skeptical this is the real reason.

You are using bitcoin, but as a store of value rather than a payment method.
With this card you can keep your earnings and savings in bitcoin. 90% of the time you'll have to sell for fiat anyway to pay for things with it - this card just streamlines the process.
Its useful because if you keep your bitcoin as bitcoin you can still pay for other things directly in bitcoin, use cold storage and hd wallets, make use of smart contracts. But the hassle is removed when you want to interact with the old fiat world.
This should really help to boost adoption in future. If enough of these people were using such a service, the demand for people to accept bitcoin directly would also increase, since it significantly reduces costs.

People are saying that this "halving" would already be taken into account long before it happens. However in my opinion the bitcoin ecosystem is pretty complex and as far as i know, no economic situation like this has ever occurred (except the last halving). The actual effect of the halving in the short to medium term is pretty difficult to determine. Bitcoin price discovery is happening every day and people's ideas of a fair price of a bitcoin is changing all the time.
So  even though this event is know long beforehand it isnt impossible to say that it wont have any visible effect. Investors may predict a rise in price, bid up the price long before, and then the event itself occurs and it turns out that the price has been bid up too high and there is a sell-off. Or it could turn out to still be too low.

"stuff" being the kind of stuff that people invest in like houses. When the investments lose value then businesses fail, people lose their jobs and start defaulting on loans. Since fiat currencies are based on debt, if it can't be repaid it becomes worth less which leads to increasing import prices and increasing consumer goods prices.
Which means technically deflation and inflation are happening at the same time (in different parts of the market).
 You could also see this as a necessary price correction but of course its not good in the short run which is the only thing politicians care about and so they'll try to delay the onset.

Actually one of the biggest advantages of bitcoin is its decentralisation. If it were possible for a government or group of governments to control the major miners and hashing power they could basically destroy the entire system by forcing KYC, forcing people to have licences to approve transactions, banning certain types of transactions etc. This could slow down the whole system and remove the permissionless innovation aspect which actually makes it useful. It would slowly become only as good as a less efficient version of a server based system (but at least more transparent.)

It will never be as private and untraceable as cash payments. When digital data is so easy to store and analyse there can be so many small things which can cause you to lose privacy.
Just as an example the tor browser just added an update warning users to keep the window at default size instead of maximising it because then you're announcing your screen size to every site you visit which could make it possible to track you.

One big reason that mining pools are so big is that the big pools experience a lower amount of stale blocks due to exactly these bandwidth issues. Once this can be reduced there can be more, smaller pools with the same amount of variance compensation.

The real innovation in bitcoin is the peer to peer consensus. The blockchain is basically a git branch with pgp-signed transactions inside it instead of patches.
As it turns out blockchains can also be useful to some people and they only seem to have noticed recently because of bitcoin but it isn't the main innovation of bitcoin itself (but a necessary piece of the puzzle).

Isn't the biggest reason that people mostly use lite clients now because the blockchain is huge and takes a long time to download? Especially for new users this could be instantly offputting because they install this application and it tells them it needs 3 days to work at all. If they buy coins and send it to the wallet before then they won't see them.

How easy is it to "prune" the blockchain though? Don't we need the entire history to prove the ownership of all existing bitcoins?
@_date: 2018-08-10 08:54:58
True, but with BTC most of the new money will either go straight into the economy or will become direct savings, whereas with the fiat money most of the new money is various debt instruments which may or may not be liquid or have any direct impact on inflation in the here and now. So expansion of the money supply in bitcoin might actually have a more direct impact on price inflation than with fiat.
edit: Of course this is unmeasurable given  the opposite effect of rising demand for bitcoin due to an expanding economy.

Interesting. I actually know of someone who has a wind turbine which at times produces so much power that it can't be fed back to the network or used by his house and just needs to be burned. This would be great if he could get access to up-to-date mining equipment.
@_date: 2015-12-31 09:41:07
I think and co talked a lot about this issue when setting up ethereum. He mentioned they even tried to come up with a way to randomly generate the mining algorithm from the hash of the previous block or something. But in the end they decided the best way to do things for them would be to simply use an algorithm that requires a ton of memory to run. This delays the onset of GPU and ASIC mining but in my opinion it would still end up becoming inevitable.
One big question is whether the production of ASIC hardware can be more decentralized, allowing more people access to new hardware so that a higher number of mining businesses can survive. Reducing bandwidth also reduces the advantage of using large pools because it reduces the overhead of stale blocks.

The thing is maybe the west doesn't "need" bitcoin, but that doesn't mean there aren't still big benefits to using it.

Gold would have value whether or not it was useful as a store of value, since it is rare and useful. Bitcoin would not be valued if it was not useful as a store of

Acceptance is the first step. It shows that is has a viable use outside of niche circles, and that that it can be integrated into the workings of major businesses without causing high risk. It also increases the value of holding bitcoin because it can be spent more easily without having to be sold.

I don't see why there would be. I looked at the mailing list and it seems that the main problem is that you could not do cold storage (at least by default) because you would always need your master private key in order to check the balance, which is the same key you need to spend the funds.
There was a discussion about ways around it but I didn't see anything completely conclusive (although I stopped reading at one point).

In order for them to have value, they need to be useful for something. In order for them to be useful you have to be able to spend  them. In order to be able to spend them, businesses need to have some idea that they will get some portion of extra business / cost saving by accepting bitcoin.

Remember occurrences like this are always possible. Even a miner/group with only 5% of mining power could potentially generate 4 blocks in a row.  But as long as it remains below 50%, pulling off any kind of attack is near to impossible, because you can't know until the end of the 4 blocks that those blocks would be generated as they were. But in order to pull off an attack you would need to include a double-spend in the FIRST block in the chain.

I wonder if anyone has any input on this. If there is a surplus of BTC buyers in one country (e.g USA) and a surplus of BTC sellers in another country (say Mexico), that would mean that there would have to be traders performing arbitrage in the other direction to make sure that the value of BTC doesn't rise higher in the USA than in Mexico.
Now of course this would happen, but what about when the countries national currency is already costly and illiquid, and hard to sell again for USD? Then surely over time there would still be a BTC price difference due to this overhead of performing the arbitrage? Then this could also really affect these numbers.

Bitcoin is still in its infancy as a currency, so that in most cases for now, doing the transfer via WU would be preferrable for various reasons that you mentioned.
However, even now, there are plenty of instances where I could in theory post someone $50 worth of Bitcoin and have it be more useful. Specifically this would be if I already held bitcoin, and the person recieving the money wanted to spend the bitcoin as-is rather than selling it for a local currency. Is this a common situation today? No. However it could still happen in the future.
As more places start to accept bitcoin, perhaps due to reduced fees and increased customer base, then it makes more sense for more people to hold bitcoin as it can be used more easily. However to reach this point will likely take time and isn't guarenteed to happen.

Not completely true. When you spend coins, normally there will be some "change", meaning the difference in the amount which was stored at that address, and the amount you wanted to pay. This change will go to a new address that you have never used before. Just looking at the blockchain it isn't always that easy to tell which was  the payment address and which was the change address. The person you payed will know, but then if you spend it again they will not know.

Honestly it is still possible that bitcoin can fail at some point. I think there is a real demand for an alternative to fiat currencies, and the services that bitcoin can provide, and even see it as a potential contributer to a future world without government. HOWEVER, it is not guaranteed to succeed. Perhaps Bitcoin will simple be another failed attempt on the way to achieve what I have stated above. There have already been many of these before. So far Bitcoin is by far the most successful of these attempts, and I really think it has a chance to become what pepole always talk about. However, only time will tell. Time and effort from many lawers, investors, business owners and of course, software developers.

Well I guess it can be a medium of exchange in some contexts. The main problem is liquidity. If I offered to pay you in either dollars or gold for something, you'd much rather accept dollars because they are easier to trade for something else (which is the point of a medium of exchange).

In the end though any term we use that isn't completely made up will have other meanings in other contexts. I think syntactically this term seems like a unit of measurement, not a concept of debt.
In a way though, one could argue that debt and money are already closely related. In order to obtain bitcoin, one must successfully mine blocks, performing a service for the blockchain. However as with fiat currency, these bitcoins cannot themselves be used for anything, but simply represent that you have done something useful for the economy, and thus are owed resources at some date it the future, when you decide to exchange them.

The interesting thing is that if you don't buy/sell on both sides of the transaction then it does end up being cheaper. Of course right now this isn't a viable option because there is nowhere to spend it. However, just the potential to be a cheaper option already creates demand for businesses who accept it, because if you can pay with bitcoin, you are saving money, so in a way it makes their products cheaper.

Credit is something which is really important to the economy, and which will not go away.
Think of it this way: I currently have a job at a local bakery, making bread and getting paid minimum wage. I barely scrape by and have enough to live on every month, with no savings even while living on bare minimum. I then get offered a much better job with higher pay but it is accross town. I currently have a drivers license but no car. How can I take the job? Sure, after I get the better job I could afford to pay for the car, but I can't even take the job until I get the car. The only solution is to either borrow a car, or borrow the money to buy a car. Its even worth paying the interest on this.

* Its already familiar to at least some people.
* It shows the separation between Bitcoin the network/protocol, and the currency.

* It can't be confused with other currencies or other digital technologies.

Price is a result of the interaction of supply and demand. If only 10% of the demand for gold is due to industrial use, and the other 90% is simply being used as a form of long term value storage, then that means that the price is indeed highly based on non-industrial uses. If for some reason people were to abandon gold as a store of value, its price could drop rapidly.
That being said, there isn't a lot of reason to assume this will happen. As has been stated gold has a long established history of maintaining its value, at least indicating that the non-industrual demand for gold can to some extent be relied on. Which also means in theory that bitcoin could also achieve this property.

I will pledge but I think it would be even better if we could set up some kind of bitcoin-based assurance contract to demonstrate one of the cool features of bitcoin.
How it works is you set an amount, say 10BTC that needs to be reached for the sponsorship to go ahead. Then you create a transaction with a 10BTC output, and contributors add money by signing inputs from their own wallets. Once 10BTC is reached the transaction becomes valid and ends up on the blockchain. If 10BTC is never reached then the contributors keep their money automatically.

Most of bitcoins advantages come when you are holding/using it and are in business with someone else who is doing the same. Faster transactions, automation, better security (when implemented properly), lower fees etc. That being said I can't see this happening particularly soon. I doubt MS or Dell are actually holding their coins for now.
@_date: 2014-02-19 17:09:32
In this case you just have to wait for the transaction you sent to be propagated around the network enough so that it has a very high change of being included in the blockchain as opposed to the second transaction, the "double spend".
If you send the double-spend before that, it would be picked up by the same computer receiving the first transaction and the restaurant would see it. If you wait too long then your transaction would be unlikely to make it into the blockchain.
The only other way would be to mine a block, hold it back while you pay for the meal, then put the signed transaction into the blockchain with the held-back block. But this is hard to do because you never know when the block will be generated, or when another node will generate a block, rendering yours invalid and not only losing you the double spend but also the block reward (which is expensive).
I should point out I have just read about this mainly and I'm not a developer (yet).

What about the term "bitcoin credits", or just "credits" for short?
* It's not ambiguous, it's obvious that it refers to units of currency.
* Its already familiar to at least some people as a sci-fi currency.
* It shows the separation between Bitcoin the network/protocol, and the currency. Bitcoin is the network, credits are the currency.
* It makes it easy to see that it isn't really a "coin" and is simply granted as part of the digital protocol.
* It can't be confused with other currencies or other digital technologies.
We could even deprecate the old "bitcoin" terminology completely.

Assurance contracts are one of the things which should be possible to implement with Bitcoin. Basically you create a transaction with the final amount as the output, and the address of the project being funded, say 10BTC to address X. Then each person who wants to contribute will sign a section which will be added to the transaction as an input. When enough inputs are available to satisfy the output, the transaction can be added to the blockchain and the funds will be transferred to address X. If this never occurrs then the funds will remain with the funders. It could also be possible to implement a timeout.

Can't really say I'm an early adopter because I never got rich from it, but I have been around with BTC since about 2011.
Bought around 100$ worth of BTC when they were worth around $1. Sold them again at around 3$ and was impressed at the money I made. Got nervous around $15 that I made a huge mistake and bought in again. Then ended up losing the same again due to the crash and panic/buying selling. Eventually I had to withdraw all my money from MtGox to pay for travel to my internship.
Over the next year or 2 the price was slowly decreasing from 10$ to 5$ and a little lower, so I just didn't do anything aside from buying BTC to just quickly buy something.
Then the rally started and at $50 I bought in again and started watching the price rise like crazy. I saw a repeated series of quick rises, corrections, followed by more quick rises. At about $250 I was starting to get nervous because I was sure a large correction was going to come like had happened (actually twice) with BTC before. At this point there was a small correction, but the price didn't rise much afterwards and actually went down again. I just decided to sell at that point but assuming it was a bad idea. Two hours later the price was at $160 and still falling. I bought back a few BTC at around $160 which lost value until the second rise last year. I also withdrew my initial investment in fiat which I had made at $50.
Now my BTC are not worth a fortune but worth a pretty decent proportion of my current savings, since I have not had a full time job for long enough to save a lot.

This is not true. I'm sick of people trying to use this analogy. Bitcoin has value because people VALUE bitcoin.

Sigh I have been holding a couple of Bitcoins now that I bought at about $160 (with some of the money I got from selling at $250 a couple of hours before that crash). Was pretty happy at $1200 (as one can imagine). I've bought a little more since and of course I'm not happy to be losing money now, but I stick by my decision to hold through whatever happens, as ignoring the bitcoin I am financially on stable grounds, and I already got the initial investment back anyway.
I definitely think Bitcoin is an awesome technology but I also accept the risk that at some point the price will not recover past a certain point. On the other hand, my initial reasons for being enthusiastic about Bitcoin still stand. This year will still be a very interesting one for Bitcoin I think, as regulators start to implement their policies (whether we agree of disagree with them) and as large businesses start to evaluate what it has added to their businesses, and also whether we see services such as remittance starting to take off.

I've read the whitepapers of DASH. Tier, layer, doesn't matter how you say it. LN could be a way to incentivize nodes as well. No, it doesn't incentivize development or promotion but interestingly that would only be temporary anyway with DASH since its essentially being funded through the block reward.
I'm not trying to create a war between bitcoin and DASH here. I don't understand the mentality between some kind of religious followers of these technologies. It's like everyone is convinced that their network is right and theirs will somehow "beat" all the others. This isn't how it works. We go forward together. DASH will be on the LN too eventually and this will even make exchanging DASH for btc even easier. With time there may even be a DASH to Ethereum bridge so that it can take advantage of the smart contract network.

E.g. MaidSAFE is a storage network that also has it's own coin which you receive in exchange for storing data and which you pay in order to have data stored. It's an important part of the network but it isn't being pushed as a world currency or a way to pay for things online or in person, or as a store of value. It's more of an asset token representing a share of the network.
You could say the same about the so-called "other coin" (I think you can get banned for mentioning the real name?). It's a smart contract platform that forms a part of an application platform known as web3. The token isn't being pushed as a world currency, no stores are likely to accept it in the near future. It can also be integrated with Bitcoin in a similar manner to sidechains. You can also build other tokens on top of it which may represent currencies backed by hard assets or simply be valued due to scarcity. They could also be used as a part of another system such as Augur's reputation points.

I don't really get the deal either. If demand for transaction volume continues to rise, then fees will rise. No amount of blocksize increases can stop this beyond a certain point. There may also be many other optimizations for on-chain scaling but in the end it isn't really efficient for all nodes to have to process/store all transactions that ever occur and have occurred.
If fees rise people will start to look for alternatives. Bitcoin can be used for direct payments as well as settlement in parallel, so people will be able to choose based on their own evaluation of the pros/cons of using higher-layer payment systems or direct to blockchain transactions.
100% it is a good thing to develop better solutions for on-chain scaling. Even higher level payment systems like LN depend on being able to make use of the blockchain and the cheaper and more efficient that is the better. But why only focus on one thing, when clearly having the whole world using direct to blockchain payments is unfeasable?
@_date: 2016-03-22 10:49:32
You could also try federated blockchains. They can be done in a way where specific people are chosen to be able to create blocks rather than using a mechanism like PoS or PoW. Transactions can be confirmed way faster but of course this comes at a big cost of security.

To maintain a stable price, a continual inflow of capital is needed to counteract the effects of inflation. Once the inflation rate halves then this inflow of capital starts to outcompete with the inflation and the price starts to rise.

Hence SegWit. It's not just about the blocksize - it also supports future developments by removing transaction malleability and introducing versioned transaction scripting which would allow multiple soft forks to take place in parallel.

I don't understand why they can show the image of the huge bubble, and return to normal and call it a "crash". I'm pretty sure "crash" just implies that it was going along happily maybe slowly upwards then suddenly lost a ton of value for no reason. But this doesn't pay attention to the fact that most of this "value" was also gained in about the same amount of time as it took the "crash" to occur.

I always saw the big alure of bitcoin as that while not only providing decentralization, censorship and tamper resistance, it also had many other enticing applications such as remittances, proofs, micropayments etc which could cause it to be used worldwide, and give the world decentralization for free.

You can have a sidechain without having to be accepted by the main network - that's the point. Also SegWit will help with this because it introduces versioned transaction scripting which will allow new features to be merged into bitcoin much more quickly.

How do you measure the consensus, though? Miner signaling is the only objective way we have to measure acceptance of new rules. Users have no way to know if they'd be triggering the UASF with 10% support or 90%.

BU isn't just increasing the block size. It totally changes the way bitcoin works at a consensus level. Miners are essentially negotiating over what the maximum block size should be, but the way it's implemented, a transaction with a few confirmations could become unconfirmed because one of the confirming blocks was deemed to be too large, and a chain with smaller blocks is selected.
@_date: 2016-03-31 14:31:40
You can write a transaction like this:
    if (UTXO older than 30 days)
        if ( 1 valid signature provided )
            transaction = valid
        else
            transaction = invalid
    else
        if ( 3 valid signatures provided )
            transaction = valid
        else
            transaction = invalid

The evidence was also shown in court and his sentence on other charges was even influenced by it despite the evidence not actually being evaluated by the jury. The accusations were listed as "uncharged crimes".
I don't think this is a clear cut case at all. I honestly wouldn't be surprised to find out that Ross actually did decide that ordering a hit was his best option, but there is definitely something fishy going on. We know that the supposed hitman, and the supposed target were both DEA agents. We don't know whether or not the DPR that ordered the hit actually was Ross. We do know that many of the DEA agents involved are also being charged with corruption and embezzlement. We don't know what other pressures and tricks they were placing on him.
The fact that the crimes weren't charged I think shows that the evidence isn't there for a conviction, or that closer investigation might have revealed something else that would be better to remain hidden.  Certainly the presence of the claims has made it much harder for him to maintain a positive public opinion, which could mask the injustice of receiving life without parole for running a website like Silk Road, for which there is plenty of evidence showing that it did more good than harm for many people.

The problem is there is no end of possible good ways to implement this and there are other serious problems that could arise if this is done without appropriate preparation.

Most people are saying no because the bandwidth usage isn't that high. However if they were making use of the actual computers on the network to do the mining then they would be slowing down those computers which could cause trouble for people using them (which may be servers which would slow down access to people connected to them).
Nowadays though there is no point mining without custom hardware but for a TV show it could be done with artistic license. A few years ago this would've been ok.

All depends if it breaks $475 reasonably soon. If that happens i guess we'll see more rises and if not I am expecting it to fall further, perhaps towards $400.

The thing is the dollar price of bitcoin isn't a measurement per se but an actual log of the real prices that people are paying for bitcoin on various exchanges.

@_date: 2017-03-24 21:41:30
Honestly as much as it sucks, bitcoin needs to go through this. It has to show that it can withstand such kind of attacks, because this is nothing compared to what could be coming if bitcoin really starts to take off. If bitcoin can withstand this, it instantly becomes a lot more interesting and valuable.
@_date: 2016-03-08 09:10:32


No we don't. The hard fork may improve things a little in the short term but LN is a long term solution. SegWit is about more than increasing the blocksize but also brings much needed features to bitcoin which will make future development a lot easier and quicker, which is why the devs choose to work on this now. If blocks become full for a long time and the network is overloaded before SegWit, then we still have the choice of just switching to Classic or Unlimited if and when that happens.
@_date: 2017-03-17 16:44:50
I don't think "substantially superseded" and "majority fork" really mean the same thing. Even with an 80% BTU market / hashrate, BTC would still exist and have a strong following, and therefore most likely exchanges would still list it as such.

"The Bitcoin XT ship has sailed, but the issue has not been put to bed."
Andreas actually partially debunked this. Paraphrasing him, the mere existence of XT can be considered a solution to the issue since if the core devs continue to delay their roll-out of the hard fork, XT will always be there ready to be picked up by miners and nodes as soon as the issue becomes critical (e.g. the doomsday scenarios of small blocks start to come true).

@_date: 2016-03-07 09:03:31
It seems like the block size debate is pretty much solved now?
1. SegWit will increase the effective blocksize to 2mb
2. Eventually there will be a hard fork
3. If the hard fork doesn't come soon enough and we have real problems everyone still has the option of switching to Classic or Unlimited
4. If Classic or Unlimited happen, the core devs will most likely merge any consensus-breaking changes back into core to make their code relevant again.
5. Regardless of how the fork plays out, in the end core, classic and unlimited will continue as forks and share code and develop new features in parallel.
Oh yeah and SegWit will also bring in versioned scripting which means things like LN, Sidechains and other interesting features will be able to be developed much more rapidly.
@_date: 2017-03-17 09:13:32
The problem is that the development of these features takes months and is very boring to non-programmers, therefore those on social media will tend to focus on drama and personality politics more than the real development going on behind the scenes.
@_date: 2016-03-04 13:30:29
The real deal with cryptocurrencies is that the security model is much more flexible and things can be set up in a way to make identity theft way less likely and less profitable than with credit cards. Therefore the level of consumer protection and insurance can afford to be lowered, which also lowers transaction costs and gives additional protection to sellers.

Actually I would argue you are more likely to do that. One is more likely to take a loan during periods of inflation to pay for things which allows you to buy them sooner. During times of deflation you would be more likely to save up and try to buy things outright. 
There are actually positive effects of people doing this though. Higher savings means more money can be invested into capital goods which will increase the rate of technological improvement in the future faster than if everyone is consuming instantly.

Nobody knows what the "right" price is due to the small speculative bubble which occurred. Price started rising very quickly after $800 was reached, since that was the previous high since the 2013 bubble. Now we are in a price discovery period, so high volatility can be expected. It should calm down again after some weeks and we will see where the price will end up.

The real reason: The influx of new money started to dry up as all the new people who wanted more now have it. Many speculators expecting a much larger bull phase had stop losses in place so they could sell before the price went down too much after this happening. The speculators are basically the people causing the big shifts up and down and the long slow growth in average prices we see underneath are the actual people choosing to hold long term and really becoming part of the ecosystem.

As for the open source argument, I think its a bad one. It's still possible to reverse engineer or clone the interface of the wallet without the source, so not releasing it doesn't really add much security. This also doesn't seem to be a problem for other wallets.

It should be noted that this doesn't mean that they have as much *money* as half of the global population. Wealth is a measure of the value of all assets owned, such as properties, factories, offices, companies, IP etc. The value of these things is always an estimate at how much it could potentially sell for if sold today. They also stand to lose a lot of this value if they start to manage their companies badly, or make bad decisions for how these assets should be used and developed.

See comment. There would be a much higer orphan rate with too much hashpower. Eg if blocks are being generated every 5 minutes then the chance that a block will be generated somewhere else in the network before yours is propagated is higher.

It will take some time for RSK to really take off though. For it to be useful for anything it requires applications to be built  on it. Currently most of smart-contract related development is being done on Ethereum itself. Porting the smart contracts themselves to RSK might not be that hard, but getting network effect and moving over the surrounding infrastructure may be a bit trickier.

You have to pay close attention. In late we've seen a lot of altcoins come out in the last year or so and we're starting to see why they probably won't challenge bitcoin in becoming the global universal ledger and store of value, although they may become much larger than they are today. However this can always change, and this wasn't always certain as we started to see more of  them come out so it pays to pay attention.

Computers are getting cheaper and faster all the time. It might make sense to think that people would always want to wait a little longer before buying a computer because if they wait, they'll be able to buy something even better for the same money in a few months. Of course that would mean eventually people would be waiting forever and no computers would ever be sold.
The thing is, people don't work like this. Time preference is the measure of how long someone is willing to wait in order to have more in the future. Give a 3 year old a cookie, and tell them if they can wait 5 minutes without eating it and they get two, most won't manage it. They want the cookie so bad. Do the same with an adult and they might tell you they're on a diet anyway.

This is the only paragraph in the article of any importance. The rest basically describes bitcoin and background information which at first appears to be part of an argument and then seems to trail off:


Despite the ridicule in this comment thread, none of this is really false. We can never be totally sure how secure Bitcoin's core technology really is - although every year of successful operation is certainly a good indicator.
However, if you are going to be placing a large amount of your financial assets into an experimental new technology, you sure as hell have the responsibility to stay on every single factors and piece of information regarding its long term value.
Can the blockchain can be hacked? Well you better be looking for research that suggests the possibility. Can your individual bitcoins be stolen from you via hacking your computer or the exchange you hold them on? You need to know these risks and take measures to protect yourself. Can the value of Bitcoin go to zero because a new currency comes along, or because people lose faith in it's long term value? Well you need to understand what value people actually see in bitcoin and know what the signs are that it is/isn't/can/can't actually live up to those expectations.
Assuming the best case scenario, the more time passes, the more of a 'sure thing' the success and stability of Bitcoin is, the less people will have to worry about these factors - and the less money there will be in bitcoin as an investment.
If you're just dumping your money into something because you heard people think it's cool and it's gaining value, there's no reason to believe you've chosen something of true value rather than another piece of trash out of an infinite number being peddled.

Isn't it the other way around? If old UTXOs become invalid, then old clients would see them as valid, and new clients would see them as invalid, causing consensus to be lost - meaning everyone has to update in order to keep consensus. Segwit introduces a new type of transaction, and can be done with a soft fork, because older clients simply see that they can't validate the new transaction one way or the other.

What people don't realise is this: bitcoin is a system for reaching p2p consensus, forks are shifts in the rules of consensus. For all parties who previously relied on one set of rules for consensus to now follow another set of rules, it requires all of those parties to agree to the rules. For a party to agree to a new ruleset they must either:
1. Think the new rules give rise to a better system
2. Prefer following the new rules to being left behind by a large number of people who already switched
The signaling mechanism behind forks is simply a coordination mechanism to allow parties to agree to switch to a new ruleset once it is known that enough parties are willing to do so. It isn't truly comparable to a state democratic model, where disagreeing parties are physically coerced into following the will of the majority.

It's still pretty tricky though. Local key management is difficult and syncing across multiple devices just increases the attack surface for hackers.

The Tether issue can be resolved through analysis of facts and does not need to be "disproven" with reference to the agenda or trustworthyness any given individual. Either there is a ton of unbacked faked Tether fueling the rise in price of bitcoin, or there isn't. Id tend to lean on the side of saying there isn't, but I'm not an expert and those who say there is seem to make a reasonable case. Id like to see the other side so I can stop being so nervous about it.

I bet nowadays there is more encrypted traffic online than unencrypted. SSL is a form of encryption which is being used on every site with a login option. WPA2 is also a form of encryption used in practically every household today. Any password protected rar file is also encrypted.
@_date: 2015-07-13 10:57:20
edit: It also helps with the problem of password reuse right? Because if the server gets hacked and all the password hashes are leaked then they can eventually be cracked and perhaps reused passwords will be found for some users on other sites. Whereas in this case there would be nothing to crack.

Word of warning: Don't think of Tor as encrypted. It is anonymous but the data you send can still be read by many different people especially the exit nodes. They just don't know who sent it. If you want encryption you have to actually talk to a website that supports it, e.g. with SSL/TLS, which doesn't require Tor at all. (maybe you know this already but hopefully its interesting to someone).

True, cold wallets are basically the secure solution and hardware wallets are just a convenience mechanism to make it easier to spend from a paper wallet.

Wasn't there an idea where you could get someone to risk burning/donating bitcoin at varying levels depending on how high-priority they made the call. E.g. you phone rings louder depending on how much money the other person is willing to risk. It uses multisig escrow to ensure that the receiving person just has the chance to either have the money donated or to give it back to the sender if they think the ugency level of the call was appropriate.

The Block reward will be 112.5 per day in 2030, but qualitatively your argument makes an important point. The issue of what would happen to the incentive structures of the system in the case of an extremely high market cap is an interesting one.


Not exactly. The total investment of resources aimed at obtaining the mining reward will tend to approach the value of the reward. Some or all of this may be invested in energy usage, however it doesn't have to be.
The money could be invested into producing more energy efficient hardware, or even more efficient ways of producing energy.
In any case regardless of how it affects mining the supply and demand would still determine the price, rather than the mechanics of mining. But any breakdown in the incentive structure may cause other issues before a certain level of market cap can be reached.

Actually I think there has always been a variety of different opinion on how bitcoin should work in the future after the transaction volume starts to increase. Off-chain transactions were always considered as a possibility - but after all the scamming and companies holding BTC going off the map this idea was abandoned for a long time (of course others saw this coming as well). There have always been people who don't care about the transaction fee as long as they  can use bitcoin as a way to fight government monetary policy, and people who don't care about it as a political tool and just see it as a great way of sending money around and paying lower fees. Everyone has their own agenda.

Their security model is that the masternode that performs validation and mixing is picked psuedo randomly based on the block hash. So as long as there is a good distribution among owners of master nodes then attacking this way isnt that easy. Mixing currently also has to be done in multiple passes by multiple nodes to avoid problems with untrustworthy nodes.

Interestingly this means that in the short term, bitcoin isn't a solution for VPN providers who can no longer use paypal but still want to get paid in fiat (assuming all payment processors will enforce these rules). However, it does mean that in the long run there is a possibility that VPN providers will want to keep the BTC and use it to pay other businesses for their services essentially creating demand for more businesses to accept BTC and creating more of a full circle economy.

At the end of the day, the blocksize limit can never be high enough to support millions of transactions per second which the LN could eventually allow.

Perhaps bitcoin itself doesn't need momentum for it to function. But it's not just traders that do. Also the industry could be hurt by any serious delays in grows and adoption of bitcoin.

I guess he means that coinbase and bitpay won't processes bitcoin to fiat payments for VPN providers, meaning if VPN providers want to accept BTC, they have to manage conversion to fiat manually, or just keep the BTC.

The old argument that open source is inherently more secure because the code is open, reviewed more etc is less relevant now since OS developers have had to step up their game majorly with regards to security to stay relevant.
On the user application side, many open source apps are underfunded and rely on coders working in their spare time and so the code doesn't get reviewed as much as you'd think. On the other hand many large proprietary apps are spending money on developing features rather than security and the code looks like a nightmare on the back end too.
The main advantage of open source is that it avoids the issues of deliberate backdoors and loss of control. We can be sure that all operating systems that are not fully open have spyware and backdoors installed by default, giving information back to various government and advertising agencies. They are careful not to leak corporate secrets to lose business, but personal security is lacking because of this.

With a shorter block time though the probability is much higher that the first block you see on your node that looks like a confirmation will actually be replaced by a longer chain that doesn't even include that block.
edit: This is also called an "orphaned block" which many are also talking about.
This can also increase mining centralization since miners with better connections to the network will suffer a lower rate of orphaned blocks and thus be more profitable. The "uncle" system used in Ethereum is one way that tries to mitigate this.

I would tend to disagree with that. Harsh regulation of cryptocurrencies could seriously slow progress, but never stop it altogether. In countries with more restrictive policies, usage would go underground, which would prevent larger businesses from dealing with it officially, but many small businesses may get away with it depending on the country. The less restrictive countries would provide a good ground for serious adoption and set an example for people so that they see a reason for the policies of more restrictive countries to be changed.
In the meantime the system itself will continue to function and be developed essentially regardless of any legislation. If the crypto tech improves and traditional fiat-based economies continue to fail, the necessity for cryptocurrencies will eventually become self-evident to more and more people. Again the biggest question here is time scale, and the manner in which things will play out.

Check out  - they have a working implementation of using micropayment channels to pay for content with tiny fractions of bitcoins, where most of the transactions don't go on the blockchain.
Micropayment channels are a simpler version of what is being built now for the Lightning Network. They just allow single direction payments between two parties. Satoshipay in this case is acting as a trusted third party for routing payments to the final recipient, so you only have to open one channel. LN will allow it to be done without a trusted third party.

The existence of LN doesn't necessarily mean the price will go up in the near term. People are more addicted to the anticipation than the actual features themselves. In 2014 after the crash, there was good news coming out all the time and yet the price kept going down for a year. What LN does mean is that when it finally starts to rally again, more scaling will be available and the network will be able to handle much greater volumes.

Look into greenaddress wallet. They have a two of two multisig wallet, and keep one of the keys on their server and use 2-factor auth. So if you get hacked the attacker would still need the second key on their server, and if the server gets hacked they'd still need your key.
There is also a timelock element, so the funds can still be recovered if one key is lost, but only after a time delay, giving you a chance to move the funds before an attacker can take them. It also prevents green address from holding your funds hostage.

Bitcoin isn't democratised. In a democracy 49% has to do what 51% decides. Bitcoin is consensus based and therefore the possibility of a fork always exists as an alternative to going along with the majority. Not splitting means the minority prefer the benefits of network effect over the supposed benefits of their change proposals. In a democracy there is (usually) the added cost of a civil war to contend with in order to split.
Edit: with bitcoin you can also fork off and still use the old and new networks at the same time which is also impossible in a democracy.

Eventually the price of bitcoin needs to reach some level of stabalisation, if it is to be really useable as a store of value. Making it useful as a store of value also makes it useful for transactions, because you don't have to convert your fiat into crypto before sending it. Right now no cryptocurrency is stable enough for most people to want to hold their entire liquid funds in it.
The big issue right now is that whenever it becomes stable, it starts actually being useful to a greater number of people, which increases the demand and then the price. Once the price increases steadily for a while it starts getting on peoples radar as a speculative investment, which eventually causes a bubble like those that OP mentioned.
The rising average prices are great, but the massive price swings aren't. I don't know what the solution to this is per se, but it isn't something that should just be ignored. 
@_date: 2017-09-10 22:48:41
I actually disagree that it would cause the price to skyrocket. People spending their btc on Amazon would push the price down if Amazon sold all the btc that they got. There would be extra publicity and discussion about bitcoin which could cause more people to invest, but mass adoption wouldn't happen since bitcoin is still pretty hard to use and understand for most people. Amazon would probably lose more money in support overheads than they got by accepting it.
The idea mentioned here of Amazon investing in btc and then accepting it also isn't likely in my opinion because it seems it would violate many regulations such as insider trading and fiduciary duty to investors.

Note that the increase in effective block size which came along with SegWit also has the same effect in this regard.
@_date: 2017-10-13 05:44:38
Honestly the main reason is that speculators realised that the price isn't done rising yet. A lot of them are nervous about a potential crash at some point out of the bubble, so when it didn't happen and bounced off $3000, and kept slowly rising from there, people gained confidence and all bought in right as it approached the all time high.

Ideally you should verify the signatures of the transactions in old blocks. If not then you can never be totally sure that the old blocks are actually valid. It essentially means that you are trusting that miners would only ever mine on top of valid blocks. While this is probably practically true in the vast majority of cases, in a world where the default case is not to verify everything, there always remains the possibility for this to change. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 18:56:52
I don't think it will really happen until LN really starts to kick off. Interestingly with fees being this low it isn't as necessary to actually use LN anymore. But in the long run this could mean it initially rolls out for high frequency use-cases, then for extra privacy, and then eventually as fees start to rise, more people will jump on board once the other use-cases have allowed for the main infrastructure has been developed.

The theory is that most people would hold BTC as a bearer asset rather than storing in a bank, which would make fractional reserve harder. Additionally central banks could not print money in order to pay back debts owed. This should mean that bubbles caused by overcreation of debt would generally be short lived and prove to be much less of a systemic risk to the entire enconomy as a whole.

We can expect a Pareto distribution on terms of how connected each node is. Some nodes will have tons of connections whereas most will have very few. However hopefully there will always be multiple ways to reach a destination that would allow you to avoid the big nodes if they either try to censor you or you worry they might try to spy on your transactions. Those two are not necessarily mutually exclusive.
On top of that, the autopilot feature isn't working very well so most people just connect to a big node manually. Later the connections will be created automatically which may distribute the connections even more.
In future graphs like this will be harder to produce because nodes won't have to publish the list of all their channels in order for routing to work.

Or you could just manage your finances like a sane person. I bought bitcoin pretty low. Didn't expect it to go up anywhere near as much as it did. Got lucky. I knew it was going to crash like this. I can't predict if and when the price will reach those levels again. I'm holding onto a large chunk of the BTC I bought for mostly ideological reasons. I'm happy with what I made from selling at various points during the bubble. The rest of my finances are unrelated to crypto. If bitcoin goes to zero it will be disappointing but not devastating to my bank account. I'd love it if we can get to the point where you don't need one and can rely fully on bitcoin.

Teenagers are getting high on a new drug called bitcoin. Bitcoin is completely legal and has been known to be traded in exchange for controlled substances like LSD and crystal meth. Youtube videos show kids laughing historically and rolling on the floor as they use bitcoin.
Taking a hit of bitcoin is known as brain mining. Mining bitcoin takes longer and longer and requires more power each time in order to mine successfully. Some experts suggest this could lead to kids requiring larger and larger doses to get high.
Ethereum is a dangerous spin off of the drug where users take Ether - usually confined the chemists closets. Ethereum is often attractive to young children by its depiction of the Doge dog image with colourful slogans.

There maybe be unknown exploits in the LN system, but even if there were they'd target specific users rather than the entire network. The problem with The DAO was that it was a huge honeypot of everyone's money together ($100M+). With LN each user will have their funds separately. Over time any remaining bugs will be able to be ironed out, overall the smart contracts are much simpler than The DAO.

Honestly these huge bubbles hurt bitcoin to some extent. Lots of people getting in thinking they're going to get rich and getting burned, lots of price volatility making actually using the currency a pain.

Yes sadly this may become an IPv4/IPv6 issue that drags on for much longer than it needs to. As we start to scale with things like LN and sidechains, we may end up with a huge userbase and then start to hit limits affecting even higher layers due to smaller blocksize on the base layer. I still don't think this justifies the "absolutely now or never" attitude of the Big Blockers though.

I think there was a podcast that explains why txless blocks don't actually affect transaction throughput.
The reason for mining this way is that miners need to have the full previous block downloaded before they can know which transactions in the mempool are valid or have already been confirmed. While the latest block is being downloaded this time would normally be wasted. Instead what they do is just download the block hash at this point and start mining an empty block. As soon as the previous block is fully downloaded, a new block candidate can be constructed that actually contains transactions and it can start to be mined.

It's unfair to say %12 when talking about such a small transaction. 24 cent for a transaction fee is normal at the moment and would have been the same (or similar) for a $100 transaction, making the fee 0.24%.

How is this as a use-case?
* Use BitWage to receive all wages in BTC
* Split between hot wallet and cold storage
* Whenever you need cash, send BTC to a card such as this one and withdraw, or spend online
* Hedge against BTC price fluctuations using various sites (e.g. coinjar, coinapult)
* Invest in startups using cryptocurrency crowdfunding as a way of potentially earning some interest
This means you can live without a bank, never have to worry about account freezes, Greece-like situations. Have full control over your money, send to other countries/people easily etc. As network effect increases many other use-cases can become available.

People in these countries were starting to get interested in BTC anyway. This expansion was causing the price to rise steadily, but then it broke the ATH which sent people into a frenzy. Especially since the price was able to recover from the bad news such as the fork risk. The scaling debate also seems to be solved now, it's just that the final solution will take some months / a year to fully play out. Once the frenzy begins, all those people in the new countries start to make big bucks, bringing a ton of more people to jump on the train and try to get rich. Those same people will sell the minute they think they see the top and we will see a big retraction. However it's understandable why this will be the biggest bubble to date.

I agree that the block limit needs to be increased but I don't think this is the solution here. This would just give spammers more room to work with. There are also other technical issues at play which would make increasing the block limit a huge boost to attackers if not done correctly (BIP101 tries to address these and does a lot more than just increasing the block limit).
Dealing with low-fee transactions in the mempool, and allowing a transaction to be easily retransmitted with a higher fee in more clients would be a good option to help with this.

But with Ethereum you can also store state within the blockchain. The result of some calculation or some input, and so that state must be calculated in order to verify the next set of transactions based on the result of the previous one. It's a domain-specific language with a very specific purpose, but that doesn't mean it isn't Turing complete within the specific context it's designed for, and that doesn't mean it there aren't tons of use cases which make Ethereum useful.

This is what everybody was saying back in 2010/2011. However we've repeatedly seen that any system that relies on trusting a single point of failure such as a bank can be compromised with disastrous consequences.
With all the research going on at the moment with sidechains, "lightning" network, alternative consensus protocols, one or many of these will likely eventually become parts of the solution to overall scalability.

This isn't an accurate representation of what blockchain.info does. They store your wallet encrypted and it is decrypted on the client. You can also make backups of the wallet if it ever goes down. The biggest security vulnerability is if somehow the site was hacked and you were sent a modified version of the client which would do something bad. But at least in that case you might hear about it happening to others before falling for it yourself. They also offer an offline version of their client which you could save as a web page.
I'm not saying they're 100% secure or that they're the best option. Just that most people misunderstand this and see them like all the other web wallets.

It's only censorship-proof if the bitcoins are worth enough to insensitive miners to perform the proof-of-work algorithm.
Fiat currencies have no intrinsic value, but have been shown at least in some countries to be a reasonable short to mid term store of value. Gold has intrinsic value, but it would not be valued nearly as high if nobody was using it as a store of value. Company stocks have intrinsic value in that they pay out a portion of the profit earned by the company. Each of these have some reason why they would generally be harder to manipulate and cause bubbles than something like bitcoin. Doesn't mean bitcoin sucks, just means that people who are just getting into it need to be aware of the risks.

One of the best reasons to buy bitcoin is that you want control over your money and would rather have to face volatility than the risk of trusting banks. Investing and speculation are imo not great reasons since the best thing in that case is to manage risk, hedge and spread investment over multiple assets.
If you really think bitcoin will one day be worth a lot of money, and you feel aligned to the philosophy of ownership and decentralisation then you can just set up a regular buy for a certain amount and ride the volatility. This way you can also spend btc when you find a good opportunity or even make donations.

You can also run into problems with the password length max size (which is of course stupid anyway and proves they aren't hashing it - but you can't help that). Plus some sites detect if you are just capitalizing the first letter of something, or that you have to put numbers somewhere in the middle or whatever.
All of this ends up increasing the risk that you forget what you did to get around the requirement. Especially if one site forces you to put in a special character, and another site doesn't accept it at all.

The difference is that the permission rules are built into the consensus protocol.

I actually think the solution will be that eventually people will have to stop worrying and learn to love self-owned keys.
I think though in the coming months/years multisig will be replaced with smart contracts allowing much lower risk of holding keys, and devices like trezor will become more prevalent. It should be possible to create for example an address which has a maximum spend output per day, unless unlocked by another key or set of keys which could be in a paper wallet or held by a company.
In the end having users manage their own keys actually helps remove any central point which can be hacked for massive gains. Hackers would have to have each individual person. Its like if there is no longer a bank to rob, you have to go around to each person in the neigbourhood and break into each safe individually.

I'm thinking this current price rise may result in a correction again back into the 6xx range somewhere, but with the general long-term trend being upwards. This is from a layman perspective but it seems that any sign of a price rise can result in over-speculation leading to shorter term "bubbles" that eventually pop. I think the days of the really massive bubbles like 2013 are over though and in fact they are detrimental to the overall usability of bitcoin so hopefully it turns out that way.

I might get downvoted for saying this but I should mention I'm a fan of using BTC wherever possible for many reasons. However, Youtube are rolling out their subscription service today. It's basically intended as a contender to Netflix and exists on a separate section of the site.

Before Bitcoin nobody was even sure if you could create a virtual currency and give it real value without it being directly issued and regulated by some central party.

The blockchain, along with decentralised consensus (which requires a blockchain) is essentially the book-keeping mechanism for maintaining information about who owns which coins.

I think the main thing is that at the moment everyone currently is tied to using the currency of their home country, and that financial services involve a high amount of trust and are only available to those with resources to access them and knowledge to understand it. In a world of cryptocurrency, there is no central bank or federal reserve to smooth out bumps and fluctuations in the currency. However, it's much easier to build to tools to allow everyday people to hedge out the risk themselves of direct exposure to the supply an demand of the currency. Loans, investment, insurance and risk management can be accessible to anyone, and no central insurer is needed.

There's really no way to verify that they are trustworthy unfortunately. They could easily store private keys for years, pretending that they don't and then wait for the right moment to suddenly empty everyone's accounts. The only way to do this securely would be to use some kind of derived key where you generate the private key yourself and send them the public part but i'm not sure if thats possible with bitcoin (if anyone knows the answer i'd like to know).

I guess the point is that by default, non-upgraded miners would see segwit blocks as valid but wouldn't create blocks with segwit or segwit-dependant transactions. Miners would have to be specifically "upgraded" to reject segwit blocks in order to block activation. If these blocking miners have 51% of the hashing power, then other non-upgraded miners will see  their chain as the longest chain, hence causing segwit to be blocked, and miners creating segwit blocks will be forked to a separate chain.
edit: However, nodes with UASF would of course choose the segwit chain by default, even if it was shorter. If the overwhelming consensus of the market is that UASF coins are the "real" bitcoin, then miners would naturally be incentivised to switch to this chain since otherwise they are mining worthless blocks. This would eventually make the segwit chain the longest chain again.

So they bought mining equipment with the illegitimately acquired money, and then mined in order to say "hey we just earned this money mining", in order to launder it.

Yeah I guess this is a bit oversimplified.
Some emails you get give you value, and you don't want to charge for them. E.g Job offers (as mentioned elsewhere in the thread), notification that my favourite band is playing in my city next month, changing my amazon password.
Some are requesting something from you like info or something, that you have to respond to but you may already feel the obligation to do so. E.g. clients, friends, family.
Some are spam that you never want to see again. Or simply just bulk promotional emails from big companies which sometimes are useful but mostly you just ignore.

Which node you're running only really matters if you're trying to make transactions. You can run a BIP148 node and switch back to core if the UASF totally fails. If you don't make any transactions between August 1st and whenever you switch back you won't really be affected by anything.
What really matters is the economic value of the BIP148-enabled chain, which will ~~happen~~ be much higher if most users only accept transactions via BIP148 nodes. This would mean that miners need to mine BIP148 in order to receive a reward that is actually worth anything.
edit: One sentence didn't make sense (see strikethrough).

It tends to jump a lot for undefined reasons. There's a few things happening right now:
* Yuan falling
* Pound falling (could also affect euro markets long term)
* Gold and silver falling
* Growing confidence in bitcoin again vs altcoins
* Scaling Bitcoin conference just took place which could have helped shed light on the future of Bitcoin's scaling issues.
* Bitfinex recovering slowly from the hack that caused the last drop
In general the current jump is pretty small in the grand scheme of things.

The blockchain isn't actually an invention really. It's basically just a git master branch without any branching or merging. The real invention is using a limited and valuable token to incentivize playing by the rules and contributing to network security.
When bitcoin was created it wasn't even certain that a token that existed on the internet and can't be inherently exchanged for anything could actually have value. It was good forethought to imagine that it could and you could almost say luck that Satoshi turned out to be right about it.
It's pretty cool how since we all know that it's possible today to bootstrap a coin from nothing that things like dogecoin and ethereum are even possible (which are both surprising for different reasons).

Honestly there's no reason the blocksize shouldn't be as large as we can possible make it while still maintaining the funtamental functioning of the system. However there is an argument to be made that it's already too large in that regard for today's systems. Coming to agreement on the right size is also a challenge which cannot be solved easily or quickly.
Second layer solutions can at least be implemented in paralell and without consenus changes, and also have the potential to scale the system far beyond that of any reasonable blocksize increase.

This only works if it already has value. The same goes for other uses such as proof of existence - miners will only secure your proof of existence if they value the bitcoins they get as a reward for doing it.
The clever thing about bitcoin is that its network effect and scarcity basically make it inevitable that it will have SOME value, though.

I don't really see the point in giving coin for upvotes. I'm much more interested in the actual data being stored in a decentralised way.

Tipping does seem to be getting done a lot on litecoin now. There is some non-ICO activity on Ethereum but mostly it generates its own traffic rather than taking from bitcoin.
I think a lot of people are using centralised mechanisms such as coinbase wallet.
Possible spam attacks stopping may be part of the reason for the drop in txs, however this is largely conjecture. Also the current bubble in price and trading seems to be mostly over or at least on hiatus. Bubbles in price usually spur a lot of tx activity.

Its a network problem. It works better at multiple levels so there can be a real economy. E.g. accept bitcoin and also use it to pay your suppliers.

As a note, the problem isn't quite as you put it. The number of nodes isn't doesn't exactly define how decentralised bitcoin is.

Ok we're talking about two different issues here. What I was mainly addressing is that government degree is what gives money value, which I don't think it is. You could have privately produced money that could in theory achieve the same status as government money.
However you are also correct in the observation that there needs to be law in place to protect property and there needs to be the possibility to enforce contracts to have a functioning economy. This is a separate issue. Paul Rosenberg (who stated he wanted to get rid of governments) would most likely argue that the rule of law and contracts is also possible without a centralised government, however I'm not going to argue with you about that here (so feel free to assume it's not possible for now if you like).

First of all just buy a small about of bitcoin for fun and play around with it - maybe even spend it on a store somewhere. If you want to invest I'd advice learning some economics, of both the standard and austrian-related varieties and decide for yourself what makes the most sense.
Also real investors generally want to spread their risk and hedge for different factors, so just buying bitcoin as your only investment you be generally discouraged in that case. But if you're only investing a small amount as an enthusiast and would be ok with losing it all for the experiment then maybe it makes sense.

Andreas Antonopolous' advice would be to invest in the technology rather than just buying currency. Learn about how to work in the industry and get good at it because people like that are already in short supply and regardless of the future of bitcoin itself, this kind of technology is only going to be on the increase.

Bitcoin isn't deflationary in that sense though. The current increase in value is due to increasing demand. Which is due to it being relatively unknown and becoming more and more known. The current rate in value increase certainly cannot be maintained, and will eventually start to taper off.


This is the big question. The original "believers" of bitcoin generally don't agree with this theory. This is however a prevailing concept in modern economic thought, and is used to justify state currencies being inflated year on year.
Certainly this has been shown to be untrue within specific markets. For example, in the computer hardware market there has been massive deflation in the cost of hardware. It has slowed in recent years, but there was a time where waiting a few more weeks to buy a laptop would mean being able to afford a much better one with the same money. However this didn't stop people buying computers or cause a downward spiral in demand for computers. Of  course this is just one data point but it could potentially shed some doubt on the idea.

This is actually very reasonable despite the clickbaity headline. I think that people just getting into bitcoin need to know the risks that most people here knew when first getting into bitcoin.
His points:
* Bitcoin is the perfect asset for a speculative bubble
* Bitcoins have no intrinsic value (meaning that people only want it because they think other people will want it in the future and for no other reason).
* If usage takes off, there are cases to be made for very high valuations (such as $1 million)
* If could also go to zero if something goes wrong or usage dies out.
* It is a useful new tool and if the usage continues to increase it will likely increase in value.
@_date: 2017-06-22 11:40:32
There are several stages to this:
* Base underlying technology matures to a level where people can start running nodes
* Enough nodes come online to provide a basic level of liquidity
* Wallets start to support using lightning via GUI
* Businesses start to accept payment via lightning
* Slowly it starts to become the norm
I honestly don't know how hard each of these stages will be to achieve from where we are now. Hopefully someone else does.

That isn't totally true either. What matters is if UASF coins have more value on the market than StatusQuo coins. Sites such as those you mentioned must support the branch that is most demanded by their customers.
The interesting thing about UASF is that if the UASF coins are worth more, then StatusQuo coins will stop existing altogether. Unless there is a stubborn group of miners who want to mine at at loss to keep it going AND have more power than miners on the UASF chain, then the StatusQuo chain will eventually be ignored even by nodes which didn't upgrade.
Running a BIP148 node is how we all make sure we only see the UASF chain and therefore show that we don't care about the StatusQuo chain. When an exchange runs BIP148 they are saying "we don't think our customers will want the StatusQuo coin enough". Of course many large companies doing this is a big indicator that there is great market support.

Are you saying that exchanges can't be rolled back?
@_date: 2017-06-09 21:07:50
Assuming 99% of non-mining users support the BIP148, but only 2% of miners support it, UASF will work and go through. Miners will be forced to switch to it or their mined blocks will simply be invalid.
Obtaining that amount of users however will not be easy, which is why there needs to be innovation on the side of coordination.

The real cost of LN will be in the fact that your funds are locked in an online hotwallet. Both meaning that routing nodes need to keep additional funds locked in order to provide utility, and are exposing them to the risk of being hacked. What the real cost ends up being remains to be seen, but will likely be much lower than on-chain transactions.

If you want to eat less you need to ensure a few things basically:
1. You're actually eating less. Sometimes things seem more healthy but actually contain added sugar or other sources of calories that make it equivalent to eating whatever you were eating before.
2. You're not eating too little. If you eat nothing but salad and don't take care to include things which will actually give you energy you'll find yourself giving up very quickly or entering "danger mode" as kinoshitajona puts it.
3. Fibre and protein. This will help to slow down the release of energy from what you do eat, causing you to feel full for longer. Sugar and simple carbs give you a short term kick of energy which gets turned into fat if not used, and afterwards you'll be hungry again.

If the UASF has overwhelming support from users then coins that are not on the UASF chain will become worthless, forcing miners to expend a lot of money with no reward to mine a competing chain. In this scenario you'd expect them to simply switch to UASF. The question is what do the users want? Is a bitcoin with segwit more valuable than bitcoin without? Bitcoin controlled by bitmain?

The hashing power will only matter on and after August 1st itself. The amount of power today doensnt really mean much. If users overwhelmingly prefer BIP148, miners will be forced to switch to mining the 148 chain or mine at a loss.

The hype of Ethereum was that "code is law" however the hard fork is proving the truth that, in fact, consensus is law. This is as true for Bitcoin as it is for Ethereum, and in fact all systems of law. When a large enough proportion people agree on a standard of law, then it becomes so.
In the case of the Ethereum hard fork, the consensus is (presumably) that the bug in the DAO contract was not intended and therefore the legitimate owners of the funds are the originators rather than the DAO hacker.

It depends what the goal is actually. If you want a fast, anonymous way of making payments across the internet then, yes, you are correct. However, many people envision bitcoin and other digital currencies displacing a large part of the government fiat economy, reducing the powers of central banks, as well as protecting consumers from inflation, and potentially business cycles (depends what theory of economics you subscribe to).
Having a "brick-and-mortar" economy would also make it much easier and potentially unnecessary to buy and sell bitcoins for local government-issued currencies.
Obviously the protections you talk about with credit cards and the likes would need to be provided for, and there is no reason that this could not be done with enough investment in legal research.

I don't really understand why people gamble on chance games like roulette or satoshidice. You will always lose in the long run.
I've played games like that at casinos but its more for the experience and I make sure I'm basically planning on losing everything I come with.
Games like poker and sometimes sports betting can be more fun because there is some amount of skill involved, although you should still never put in more than you can afford to lose. I see short-term bitcoin trading as a kind of sports betting too really.

I don't have a quick explanation to give you but you can find information everywhere.
Basically objects don't have value inherent in them. Individuals value things depending on their perceived usefulness and they do it relatively to the things they have to give up in order to get them. Different people will value different things differently and this will change over time depending on the situation and circumstances.
There are plenty of things which require a ton of labour to obtain but which nobody values at all.

I don't see any reason for bitcoin to have value as a store of wealth if it can't be exchanged for anything, and especially if future prices could change at any moment.
What would give bitcoin long-term sustainability would be liquidity. 
The other thing is most of bitcoins advantages come in its ability to be used for transactions, namely the ability to send money in a very short period of time over the internet to any country with incredibly low transaction fees without having to rely on the trust of the recieving party or a money transmitting agency. It being semi-anonymous is also an advantage. Even if we assume law enforcement can very easily figure out who someone is, there are still other advantages to "psuedonymity" in cases within the law.

They keep records, and even publish them publically. 
From shapeshift tos:
"ShapeShift also does not in any way obscure the information that it does request or obtain. Due to the inherent transparency 
of blockchains, transactions to and from ShapeShift are public and easily correlated. Utilizing ShapeShift to obscure 
transactions or assets in any way is pointless and stupid. Law enforcement has full access to blockchain information that 
goes in or out of ShapeShift’s system."

Just seems like people with high electricity costs will accept transactions only with high fees, and people with low electricity costs will accept transactions with both high and low fees.
What this leads to isn't a race to the bottom, but just that lower fees are accepted, but by a smaller proportion of the network, meaning that on average it will take longer.

This is why so many people support the NAP (Non-aggression principle). In the case of hacking a bank account, I am allowed to toggle whichever voltage lines I like on my computer provided I am not infringing on the property of others. By hacking the bank account I am violating this and hence what I'm doing is illegal.
The NAP is not perfect by any means but it does provide a good guideline in cases like this.

Lower fees, faster and less hassle.

We can simply have two more blockchains. One for marscoin which is esentially just a clone of bitcoin, and another one, galaxycoin whose blocks are generated very slowly. Then to transfer money to and from mars you first buy some galaxycoin, send it over and then use it to buy marscoin or bitcoin.

The main advantage to Bitcoin is liquidity. It is actually money and so you can actually spend it without having to buy Yen again.
That being said the economy is very small so you may have trouble finding anything you want to buy, but of course as the economy grows that will be less of an issue. The other big disadvantage is the risk because it is a very new economy and currency.

I would say the higher prices are because basically most bitcoins are generated outside the country by people who want payment in something other than argentinian pesos.

$1000 is in no way the norm. There is also no evidence to suggest that the price will return there in a short period of time. Every time the price has risen this quickly it has ended up overvalued and gone down and stayed there for a while.
Now we can hopefully go back to slowly building up bitcoin's infrastructure, getting more places to accept it and then eventually this will start to increase the true value of bitcoin.

 What would be really good is if you could easily split payment between multiple people when paying in groups. E.g. an address/QR code is displayed for payment, and each person paying can send his or her potion of the cost to the address, and the order will go through assuming that the entire bill has been paid.
This would make it a lot easier for groups to pay, rather than having one person pay through debit card, and the rest having to find the cash to pay him.

The interesting thing about bitcoin is that the first bitcoins ever to 
be mined were worth zero. This means that the ability to store or transact wealth in bitcoin did not exist at all. The process of going from there to where we are now is almost mystical.
Now though this argument is more an issue that we do not have a deeply ingrained economy transacting in bitcoin, meaning that its usage could fizzle out and its price drop at any time. I still maintain that only time will tell whether such an economy will develop, although I would say it is looking very good at the moment.

Its been two days. For anyone who wants to use bitcoin as a currency rather than just to make short-term cash, they should wait. Even if the prices surges, this is actually a bad thing because it just means more uncertainty.
If I wasn't so scared about keeping my money on exchanges I'd just keep a bunch of dollars on one so I easily get access to bitcoin if I want to spend/use it, but not have to worry about price fluctuations.

When people accept bitcoin as payment, they are also potentially getting bitcoins without having to simply trade them for dollars, and they become now a market for other entrepreneurs to accept bitcoin from, causing more growth.

Honestly I would say just get some now. My recommendation would be to budget assuming you are going to lose it all. Also try to hold onto it through downturns. Even if you bought some now we could see $500 in a few months. But in the long run I think there is still a LONG way to go. There was a post recently showing that there are only 2 million addresses with any bitcoins in them.
My current plan is to keep all of it in bitcoin and never sell it back to fiat unless I really have to. I will simply try to spend the bitcoin as bitcoin. If it really takes off it will become easier and easier to do so.

It's a money protocol for defining a currency. Not sure what your point is?

If I could easily pay for things around the place with bitcoin I'd probably increase my holdings because it would be a really convenient way to pay for things over using cash/debit card.

It is... It means you can access the same wallet from multiple devices through a web interface without having to worry about other people having access to your money without using it. I think you are a troll.

The only problem is you neeo to fine some way to prove there aren't two notes with the same keypair which would be kinda hard

Every time that's happened though, it only drops back to what its value was literally 3 or 4 days before that, and then the fallout from the crash pushes it down a bit more over the coming week or so, only to eventually recover.
I think this stuff is mainly just a result of low volume. The fact that the price can double in 3 or 4 days is what causes it to half in the same time. So with more volume it becomes much less likely.

Whatever happened to clearcoin? Surely that would eliminate this kind of thing?
edit: Plus paper receipts, signed etc would be useful.

Same with the IRC channel, although here actually tends to be better than the IRC channel which is strange considering the greater barrier to entry.
edit: I imagine each form of communication can handle a certain number of people constantly communicating about a topic before it breaks down and becomes a race the the bottom, and  that IRC can handle less people than reddit.

I think dealing with companies with blizzard the simply way should just be something along the lines of "I want to get the game, I have bitcoins, why don't you take them?" Followed by some information about how easy it would be to do if they wanted to.
I think this is more likely to have a better effect especially when it becomes highly requested than simply trying to argue the philosophy or the advantages behind it. Let people like bitpay themselves do that.

But actually kinda serious

I get all my BTC/USD updates in roman numerals.
@_date: 2013-04-26 12:37:01
I wonder how long before this sort of thing starts cropping up in other places. This is really exciting.

It's a bad idea to watch stocks so closely. It should always depend on the time period you intent to speculate over. If you truly want to hold BTC for lets say 2 years, then checking the price every 2 seconds is bad since it's much harder to see the average trend because of all the noise. Basically the shorter time period that you continually check, the closer to 50% chance there will be that the price went either up or down, and the more nervous you get and more chance you will do something stupid.

Just because they control 51% of the network doesn't mean they can instantly do all those things. It just makes it more likely that they could do it. But it's proportionally likely with any significant portion of the network. 51% is no magic number. Plus it means you just have to wait for a few more confirmations on your transactions before accepting them as fact.

Well although bitcoins aren't illegal in argentina, buying them is almost illegal because you almost always have to buy then from someone with a currency that isn't argentenian pesos, the obtaining of which is illegal. And the price is higher there than average.

This means we'd be paying $130/BTC when the price was $115

You as an owner of bitcoin can go to the place in question and sell it.
@_date: 2013-12-19 08:33:58
Prices go up, prices go down. People seem to forget that here in the world of bitcoin.

Why  are they using "pc"? They mean percent right? So people are losing 80% of their savings??

I'm thinking [OpenSim]( + Bitcoin + [Occulus Rift]( would be something that could actually take off long term.
@_date: 2013-05-01 19:43:08
Because we want to, you know, actually use it. But in order to do that you need some part of your savings in bitcoin and it is a pain to be losing it.

Could these not be traded like actual paper money?

If if was integrated with a site like blockchain.info you'd be able to make use of its two-factor authentication so that they'd need your blockchain.info password, and your phone in order to do that.

Its possible to set up multi-sig transactions to allow for both consumer and buyer protection using unbiased third parties. Basically two of three people need to sign the transaction to either refund the buyer, or transfer to the seller. If both the buyer and seller agree on where the money should go, then no problem. If one disagrees, the second signature can come from the third party, either in favour of the buyer or seller.
This could also open a market for trusted third parties.

That's just shifting the burden of chargebacks onto paypal, which they've already shown they don't want to do.

Just wait till they realise that they can just buy bitcoin and then start making much more positive reports.
@_date: 2013-04-21 23:56:36
Yeah so people are already considering to just refer to mBTC instead of BTC as the general currency. So a load of bread might cost 20mBTC

The problems with obtaining and spending bitcoin are basically something that only time can heal. Slowly but surely more places are starting to accept it, and slowly that will mean more people have access to bitcoin as a source of income and thus creating more of a market for these people to spend it. The question is whether this problem will solve itself faster than it takes for someone to come up with a "bitcoin-killer".
