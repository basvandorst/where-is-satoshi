That statement demonstrates EXACTLY how little you understand security.
The correct analogy would be - people can steal money from ALL wallets of brand X instantly and globally, and pretty much guaranteed to get away with it.
And people generally don't store large amounts of money in their physical wallets. When it comes to Bitcoins, people do. Second flaw in your horrible attempt at an analogy.

What do you mean by "stabilize"? No currency in the world has a fixed value.
Bitcoin is more volatile at the moment than most (but not all) currencies, mostly due to its growth. It will take a few years for it to propagate and the volatility to lower.
Your pricing problem is not a problem. You can simply use the current BTC exchange rate and adjust your prices in BTC every X minutes. It's trivial to do.

That's the problem, even if it's not in that source code, there's no guarantee you didn't submit some other code to Google. There's no guarantee that some rogue Google employee didn't mess with it before publishing it.

It's very unlikely BTC will be the only big cryptocurrency. It pretty much is guaranteed to be the biggest for a looong time now, since all the infrastructure is being built for it now. You don't see LiteCoin ATMs being installed by the thousands, do you?
It's also very unlikely BTC will overtake USD and EUR soon. It might happen. But it will take years, or, more likely, decades.
If BTC takes the place equal of USD, which total current value [M2]( is around $10.952 trillion. Divide that by 21 million possible BTC. Comes to the price around 1 BTC = $520,000.

In many countries that just swapped prices 1 to 1, even though the valuation of currencies was different, basically creating money valuation out thin air. I know that happened in Italy, for a fact. What used to cost 1 lira, started to cost 1 euro, even though 1 lira was not valued at 1 euro.

Wrong. With bitcoin-qt you can look at the code, compile it, and keep using it. You have control over it. With a google browser plugin you can't do that, since both the author and Google (and, potentially, agents like NSA) can push an update at any moment.
None of what you wrote addresses my concerns. In fact, you admit that both an evil employee and an evil author can steal millions until it gets discovered.

Yes, half came from A and half came from B into X, but not necessarily into Z.

A real life example: if you put 4 quarters from from wallet A and 4 quarters from wallet B into X, you can take 1 that originated from A and 3 from B and put them into Z.
Plus your attempt doesn't solve anything - you now have two sources to trace. I repeat this operation a 10 times and you have 1024 sources to trace. It quickly becomes meaningless. Thus, bitcoins can be untraceable.
That's why there's no service identifying the owner of an arbitrary wallet. Nobody knows who owns what besides a few people/companies who chose to make their wallet addresses public knowledge.

Because people get products and services in return for their BTC. They use products, which break or get outdated eventually, so they buy more.
In your example there's not even a product or a service, it's not a transaction, you're just moving money around. 
I don't think ONLY transactions affect the price. Transactions define, tell you how much people value BTC at the moment. There are hundreds of factors affecting the price.

No, it doesn't.

I do agree that using these random addresses is horrible and caused some people to lose money.
@_date: 2013-12-13 15:11:25


Why all? I used one. How will you distinguish that from real transactions? Like I buy a laptop on craigslist with BTC. The ex-laptop owner buys a sandwich. The sandwich seller buys a Tesla car. 
Now you marked the laptop seller and the sandwich seller and the tesla seller as me. Fail.


Only if they are within the jurisdiction. I will pick the one that's not.


VPN + TOR. Good luck with that IP address.


It actually is - there are VPNs outside of any government jurisdiction. TOR has not been hacked yet. 
You're assuming the whole government will throw all its resources at finding out who the owner of a disposable address with a tiny amount of BTC is. Will never happen.


I sent a homeless person to hire another homeless person to ....
You can actually buy burner phones with BTC or privately on craigslist.


First of all, you wouldn't know the location. I can sell privately on craigslist, there's no record of who sold what. Same with localbitcoins.
Second of all, I will instruct my people to wear hats, so they can't be identified. There are so many ways around it.
Your major fail is the assumption that someone will throw unlimited resources at finding the owner of a disposable wallet that's not directly connected to the main wallet. No government can afford it, there are too many wallets out there and money gets moved at crazy rates.

And then you go ahead and give a dumb "counter-example" where just two people send a ton of BTC back and forth and how that doesn't affect the price. Duh.
In reality, if we have a billion people using Bitcoin for actual transactions, even equivalent to $10/day per person on average, that's $10B in transactions per day. Considering there are around 12 million BTC available at the moment, the minimum possible price would be $10,000/12 per BTC = $833/BTC. 
That's if every single BTC is being traded. In reality most BTC are being held.

1) Create a file like **x.key**, paste your key in it.
2) In your bitcoin client go to Tools -&gt; Import private keys (At least in MultiBit it works that way)
3) Click on "Import From", select **x.key**, press "Import private keys" button at the bottom.
4) It will take some time to load the data. You will get access to your money.
5) After you're done, make sure to overwrite **x.key** contents with something random. Don't just delete it, it can be recovered.

That's not true. A sell order of 76K BTC would drive the price below $100 on ANY exchange in a few minutes. That's with zero panic selling. 
Your error is in assuming that ALL bitcoins are being traded on exchanges at any given time, which isn't even close to reality.

"Ah, So they wait one week and then withdraw at the usd/btc rate of that time?"
I don't think so. You trade BTC-&gt;USD instantly, but then you have to wait a long time to withdraw the cash. That "long time" can be from three weeks to six months from what I saw.
So yeah, you could make a profit in USD. It will be less than what you think, because you need to account for all the withdrawal, deposit, trade fees and taxes.
And since MtGox is in Japan and BTC-e in Russia, you will have to declare the movement of large amounts of money.

Because bitcoins have many good properties no matter what the price is.
You can "store" them in your mind by remembering the password.
You can transfer them globally nearly instantly with low or no fees.
It's accepted pretty much everywhere globally even now with a few exceptions.
It's nearly anonymous.
I actually don't think $10,000 is the upper limit. It all depends on what niche it takes. Plus bitcoins are constantly lost, thus slowly driving the price up indefinitely.

They define it.
If I want to buy something for $1000 worth of BTC, I have to spend $1000 on buying BTC (not considering the case of holding for a long time and waiting for the price to go up, since only a few people in the world were smart enough to do that).
And since the supply of BTC is limited, the number of people transacting goes up, and assuming the prices of goods in $ stay relatively stable, BTC price must go up. There's no alternative, mathematically.

Upside means "the more positive aspect of a situation", not "exactly the same".
Other than for my retirement funds, I would have no reason to deal with your mutual fund. MFs are a pain in the ass to deal with. That's not even counting all the fees that come with them.
So I really think you should target the IRA/401k crowd, since there's no option to hold it in BTC directly. It's a HUGE HUGE HUGE market still, since "IRA/401k crowd" is pretty much everyone working.

@_date: 2013-12-13 15:43:57
Ok, here's a simple example to show how wrong you are.
Imagine wallets A, B, F, X, Z.
A contains stolen BTC.
F is a laptop seller.
B is just a random legit person.
So now you see these transactions, 1 BTC each:
    A -&gt; F
    B -&gt; F
    F -&gt; X
    F -&gt; Z
Can you tell whether X received stolen money? No.
Can you tell whether Z received stolen money? No.
All you can tell is that X and Z got their money from F, which received both stolen and legit money.
It's just a simple example. In reality F will receive thousands of transactions. Stolen money and legit money gets mixed, you lose trail. Transactions branch out very quickly. Very soon you will have to track hundreds, then thousands, then millions of wallets. It becomes pointless very quickly.

I'm a strong believer in BTC, but when investing large amounts you need to seriously stay rational and ignore all the "to the moon" hype. Yes, it's possible Bitcoin will hit $5000 or $10000 in 2014, but it's also possible it will hit $250.

So? I will have 1 disposable wallet for every time I want to buy something.
And if I want to be even more paranoid, I can always sell on localbitcoin from a disposable wallet for fiat and then use the fiat to buy things.
@_date: 2013-12-13 20:56:38
Because there are billions of people, not "a million". 
The number of BTC available for sale is actually very low - most BTC owners hold on to them. 21 million is just a theoretical maximum. 
Go look at the market depth of the largest exchange MtGox. All you can buy is 26 thousand BTC, and that would drive the price to $7000 per BTC. 
It's even less on other exchanges.
You're also confusing the current price with the value. Just because the price is $850 and there are around 12 million BTC mined to date, doesn't mean that $850*12m = $10 billion dollars were spent on all of them.

A bitcoin address is a 160-bit number. It means there are 2^160 possible wallets (in reality it's a bit less, because of the overhead).
What does that mean? Well, there are around 2^80 atoms in the universe. If you assign 1 billion wallets to each atom, you're still not likely to experience a duplicate.
Your wallet doesn't actually store the bitcoins - it's just a key to access your bitcoins, which are stored on the distributed network. So changing your wallet will get you nowhere.
Bitcoin is semi-anonymous, because only addresses and transactions are public, which are numbers. There are no names attached to them. Technically when you buy or sell bitcoins, your anonymity is broken. But nothing stops you from creating a thousand anonymous wallets and moving money around between them.

Remember that all you see is wallet IDs and transactions. You don't actually know if they are legit purchases or just me moving them around.
At what point do you decide "that thief just sold some on localbitcoins or craigslist, let's subpoena them"? You just don't know.
Heck, anybody can set up a BTC electronics store and launder millions per month through it. If you have decent deals, legit people will buy through it as well, which means you have a ton of clean BTC to mix with dirty BTC. Trail ends very quickly. Or rather spreads very quickly.

I just showed you an example where it's pointless to trace. Yes, you have records of transactions, but you don't know who owns what, who is legit and who is a thief. 
It's trivial to download the copy of blockchain, and then watch how stolen money spreads to a thousand wallets, then to ten thousand, then to a million. The question is what to do about it. The more time passes, the higher percentage of these transactions will be legit. 
Nobody has resources to subpoena thousands of stores to get details on ten thousand wallets, only because there's a tiny chance they maybe have a tiny portion of stolen money. No judge will approve that.
And even if they do, now they have names of ten thousand people who that stolen money (maybe) spread to, most or all of them are absolutely legit.
Most stores don't even keep the record of their buyers, only the amount and the date of purchase for tax reasons.
What will you do with all of that?

Actually a selloff of thousands of BTC will only cause a temporary problem. The classic MtGox hack of 2011 illustrates it. A fake order for 500,000 BTC was placed during a hack, driving prices to as low as $0.01. A few people who had buy orders lined up got lucky and purchased them at that price, at least one of them was even able to withdraw the maximum per day allowed.
The price bounced back VERY quickly. 
So yes, it would be a huge selloff and a crash, but some people will make fortunes buying dirt cheap BTC.

You can follow the transactions, but once they branch out, you don't know whose money they are. 
Imagine the thief buys a car with the stolen BTC. Then the ex-car owner buys a laptop with that BTC mixed with his older BTC. Then the ex-laptop owner buys a cake with that BTC mixed with his older BTC. 
So now you have:
1)  a thief 
2) a legit person who definitely received stolen money (car seller)
3) two legit people who maybe received stolen money (laptop seller and the cake seller)
And keep in mind, all you have is their wallet IDs, you don't actually know who the owners of the wallets are.

@_date: 2013-12-13 13:36:34


You really don't get it. 
Imagine I create a thousand disposable wallets. Then I randomly send random amounts from my main wallet to these thousand (looks like I'm spending my money). Then I move money randomly between these 1000 and another 1000 wallets, as much as I'm willing to pay for the fees (looks like my buyers are spending money).
In the end I end up with 2000 wallets with random amounts in them that have transactions in and out, and look like any other random wallet on the blockchain.
When I need to buy something anonymously, I pick a random wallet. If it doesn't have enough money I add money to it from other random wallets until I have enough. I make a purchase. I never use that wallet again.
I can do other things to even further anonymize my money, like sending money to one of those dice games, making bets at something like 99.9%, then withdrawing to a brand new wallet.
If you know how to trace any of that, let's hear it.
