Whaou ! Is so deep for me. You say to me the creators of GreenAddress worked for nothing and the miners keep the money !?!? And who controls this apply ? I am desperate and bewildered, you know that ! Part of my savings are in the internet wild algorithm and I can't do anything. Who knows break the damn code Google Authenticator ?

Now I installed 2of3 account. It's better for find a solution ?

You can't made a backup of your Google authenticator code. I have the mnesique security but GreenAddress don't open my account with it !

Of course GreenAddress charge any commission, why you claim such this thing ? Open an account and make transfers GreenAddress BTC and see if you do not pay commission !

OK Thank you but how can I back up my keys ? And about the question of responsability I don't understand why there are adress and email of GreenAddress if anybody can't speak with me ?

But then who is responsible for this wallet ? What can I do with my problem of Google Authenticator ?
@_date: 2016-06-15 15:48:25
Just 1 account
@_date: 2016-06-16 09:39:33
You sure ?
@_date: 2016-06-15 15:54:24
When you pay commission is a free service for you ?
@_date: 2016-06-16 09:30:55
Is simple account, so I think is 2of2 because I have nothing in the part 2of3
@_date: 2016-06-15 15:46:13
When you pay commissions each time you do a transfer is a free service for you ?
