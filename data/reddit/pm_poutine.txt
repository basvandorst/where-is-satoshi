Why have an ICO when you can just fork bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:52:00
Haha, that's how I knew this stuff.

Get a vertcoin wallet and the one-click miner. It takes several clicks to set up (and there are YouTube tutorials available), but after the initial setup is done, you can get it start and stop it whenever you want with a single click.

So the whales simply want a sense of pride and accomplishment?

I eighth this.

Pastor says if BTC reaches 50k, he will eat my wife's balls.
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:08:06
How the fuck is reducing the block size a good thing!? The block size should be increased!

Don't forget to harvest a kidney from each of them too! There's good money to be made there.
@_date: 2017-12-08 08:02:16
Buying bitcoin is much less stupid than this. It's quite smart actually.

How did Andreas manage to get that address? Did he have to generate a whole bunch of addresses randomly until he got one with his name in it?
@_date: 2017-12-28 06:13:26
American actually.
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:47:00
Better exchange it for monero...
@_date: 2017-12-19 08:40:40

[Yes there is.](

Granite slab is the best.

Where can I buy donkeycoin?
@_date: 2017-11-24 07:26:23
How much do you pay?
@_date: 2017-11-08 14:58:44


@_date: 2017-11-26 14:57:47
Using Decentraland?
@_date: 2017-11-08 15:11:51
Because of the fork
@_date: 2017-11-12 02:23:16
Would those timeouts be detrimental if a majority of the hashing power disappeared or switched to a fork?
@_date: 2017-11-24 05:34:50
Especially since he/she gave us information about the algorithm.
@_date: 2017-11-24 05:42:44
Could've mined on a sliderule in 2009.

They'll be added in a future BIP.
@_date: 2017-11-05 14:30:46
That's the same reason I held off buying some for so long. I regret it so much now.
@_date: 2017-11-26 08:01:48
You just want his stash of bitcoins. I'm your real lover @_date: 2017-11-28 23:23:50
You could give some to me...
@_date: 2017-11-28 23:22:58
Fork me please!
@_date: 2018-02-16 18:10:41
Too similar to "blockchain" IMO. I like "wallet."

Will Ellen become the next McAfee?

Ok dude, take the tinfoil hat off.

Downvote for Babs.
@_date: 2018-02-03 19:25:56
The fees and prices are crazy though.
@_date: 2017-10-20 21:14:57
I'd prefer 7000...

"My bitcoins are 100% all-natural, free-range, certified organic, fair-trade, gender-neutral, gluten-free, low-fat, made in America, artisinal bitcoins! They're vastly superior to every other bitcoin on the market!"
@_date: 2017-10-21 14:50:40
Pretty sure it's heavying actually.
@_date: 2017-10-21 14:39:41
He could open an exchange account with a pseudonym and use it to buy monero.
@_date: 2018-02-03 18:09:56
Coinbase only lets us Canadians buy, and only with a credit card. We need to use a different exchange to cash out.
@_date: 2017-10-26 23:36:56
You mean that guy Anonymous?

We are all Satoshi on this blessed day :)
@_date: 2017-10-24 14:53:50
I wonder if he is Satoshi...
@_date: 2017-10-20 22:30:01
Seems reasonable to me. I think you're right.
@_date: 2017-10-12 20:56:35
Sell one of your kidneys too.
@_date: 2017-10-20 22:31:09
Or buy altcoins.
@_date: 2017-10-21 02:14:12
It's possible, but it's only profitable if you have access to cheap electricity, and it's only practical on a large scale. Other coins are much more profitable to mine.
@_date: 2017-10-20 22:21:17
They actually use US dollars as well as currency from other countries.
I've heard they use Zimbabwean currency too still, but they go by weight rather than denomination, (meaning they weigh stacks of cash to determine the stack's value). I can't find a source for this though.
@_date: 2017-10-20 22:35:41
Imagine how high the price would go if big drug cartels invested in Bitcoin instead of drugs. They'd probably make even more money too.
@_date: 2017-10-21 14:18:57
Like vertcoin?
@_date: 2017-10-20 00:24:31
I guess [this]( is vertcoin then. 
@_date: 2017-10-21 14:36:51
He probably mined a lot in the early days.
