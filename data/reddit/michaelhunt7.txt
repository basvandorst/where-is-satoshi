Lol I truly can’t even imagine.
@_date: 2019-07-17 00:20:56
So the more you post here on reddit and try and tell all of us about the future the more the timeline would deviate right? So why are you doing this right now? And in your timeline have the genesis blocks been moved at all yet? Did Satoshi ever reveal himself eventually?
@_date: 2019-07-11 19:43:32
So I should get some of that dip?
@_date: 2019-07-11 19:17:22
Or it could bring some new people into bitcoin space that have known and heard about it for some time but still think it’s “garbage” and has no use.
@_date: 2019-07-01 22:22:20
Who the Don Cheeto?
@_date: 2019-07-05 16:09:45
Most people still think it’s garbage no matter what you them them though. Sucks to be them.
@_date: 2019-07-11 19:40:32
I think he means just picking a specific day or days of the month and when those dates come just make the bitcoin purchase manually yourself.

Kevin O’Leary is a fucking joke now. “It’s not investible cuz it aligns him with drug dealers and human traffickers!?” What? Lol yes because his US dollars aren’t being used to pay for these same things already. The reasons these talking heads try and find to shit on crypto is hilarious. Sad thing is that half the people out there believe him.
@_date: 2019-07-23 22:36:46
Plot twist. We finally discover how to unfreeze him, so some nefarious outcast that cursed bitcoin for ages and has nothing decides to go and unfreeze Walt Disney. Then him and satoshi battle it out to see if personal and financial freedom wins or wether we get corporate enslavement of the masses for another 100 years.
@_date: 2019-07-19 22:28:23
I don’t think he’s referring to his livelihood surviving on bitcoin. he just means it being better with more financial freedom versus less. Like the government likes to do already, having control and influence over the worlds market can easily effect all of us working and contributing to the economy.

@_date: 2019-07-23 20:58:21
Well good luck when you go to sell for whatever they might owe you when it hits near a new ath with huge trading volumes. When the price reacts with large sudden volatility robinhood suspends all trading for bitcoin until it stabilizes. Don’t be surprised if robinhood doesn’t let you get out the moment you want to when the time comes and lose a large amount of your gains. It happened recently during one of those large price swings when it pushed 13k.
@_date: 2019-07-01 22:19:51
Seriously. It’s been all of a few days lol
@_date: 2019-07-20 19:03:10

They only started asking people to report their crypto gains on income taxes as capital gains if they sold and made money. They didn’t do anything like spy on users internet usage to see if they were using exchanges or trading crypto. Which is more along the lines of what this is implying.

@_date: 2019-07-12 19:17:41
I think we need to worry about keeping bitcoin around as any store of value before we start worry about it replacing fiat more. It’s still very vulnerable and has a tiny market cap compared to the global markets still.
@_date: 2019-07-01 19:57:22
Because if you sell now and it it does turn around again you will likely end up losing more buying back in. if you just wait with what you have now until after it goes back above 12k you’ll likely do better than if you sold now then end up buying back in at a higher price than you sold once it goes back up. Unless you really believe it will drop again significantly below the 10k point it’s at right now then sell and buy back after it drops more. It’s really up to you depending on what you think might happen.
@_date: 2019-07-05 16:05:23
Yea I was referring to like 2011-2012 days. I had an old laptop from college I had mining for a day or so after someone tried to show me what btc was then. I didn’t think much of it then and was ignorant lol the laptop got fried at a party and I’ve failed to retrieve it since. Yes I obviously did not know what I was doing then.
@_date: 2019-07-01 20:01:17
How does that work? So my bitcoin would be worth about 7x more right now if I were to go to Zimbabwe and sell it to someone there via local bitcoins? Instead of the exchanges right now where 1btc is about 10k?

The gold that people speculate and trade on isn’t gold being used anywhere. It’s gold sitting in vaults. How is that providing any value to the economy other than using it to speculate price against currency. Yet it’s actually wasting more of all of those resources you mention simply to move it from one vault to another.

@_date: 2019-11-26 19:48:54
From being invested in bitcoin since the last big big high in 2017 and watching its activity and the news sentiment since. This seems to be the most logical explanation. Last year I remember all of these same negative articles about it for months before it started to turn around. Even once it started creeping up no one was talking about it until it was back up between 6-7k. Once it’s low so low that you don’t hear about it at all and starts to flatten, that seems like the time to buy before the bulls take control back. Who knows how it will play out this time though before or if it comes back up again.

Futures mean you will buy the asset on the date that the contract specifies for the price you agreed on when it was written. An option gives you the OPTION to buy the asset anytime you want for the strike price in the contract as long as you exercise it before it expires. If not it expires and is worthless.

@_date: 2019-11-29 02:34:31
Hey man if it makes sense to you then fuck the haters. The math behind bitcoin definitely gives it more trust I’d say. Which I think can influence the value somewhat because trust, or a lack of trust in their current fiat based systems helps drive more people to bitcoin and crypto.
@_date: 2019-11-04 21:05:55
Wouldn’t robinhood be fine if bitcoin goes down in value not up? It would be once people try to take out their profits that would clean them out when they wouldn’t be able to pay since they weren’t holding or managing bitcoin reserves transparently or maybe even at all lol
@_date: 2019-11-15 19:07:16
I don’t think it would work that way. We can’t give things a price. Only the market and people’s needs and Society can.

I want to see what the positions are. are those on there?
@_date: 2019-11-15 20:09:01
Right now it’s value is always going to come back to the dollar because the dollar is the most global currency we currently have. Crashing the dollar and every other fiat currency and replacing it overnight would have serious repercussions. 
I guess I could see it’s ability to speed up adoption. But this would still make it have less of a value 10 years down the road. Not nearly as much as it’s valued right now from the start. More utility is going to come with more adoption, but adoption won’t have to come with more utility. Adoption mostly comes down to trust. Utility is just an excuse I think most people use that trust the current system more.
@_date: 2019-11-26 20:08:38
I just love how they find the most emotional sounding story for a finance website. As soon as the traditional markets slow down which is inevitable it will start picking up again. Love how no one is speaking about fed repo rates again the last 2-3 weeks. Last fed meeting Powell said they had to probably keep up with these short term repo loans to the big lenders until government can give a permanent solution. Like getting rid of the post ‘08 regulations. Not saying this will be the cause. But there are plenty of signs that the traditional markets aren’t doing as great as people are really saying. We are one ticking time bomb away from a fall or possibly runaway inflation if the powers at be do something stupid here or didn’t look far enough ahead to see what consequences might come from their actions. Also, Wall Street still ultimately would not want bitcoin to succeed, we have to understand that. They depend on the failures of fiat to help them keep their wealth.

I’d bet on the latter. Regardless of your opinion on cryptocurrency or bitcoin and the like. Libra is a scam that is simply an alternative to online mobile payments that is trying to sell itself as a cryptocurrency, while not having a single quality of what a cryptocurrency is. Why would companies like PayPal/MasterCard and visa like they are trying to get want to try and do anything like this with Facebook when they are companies that already do the same thing better and more efficiently. This whole crypto play by Facebook made me want to short them hard for this year and now I wish I did lol it reeks of desperation from them to stay relevant and adapt to today’s Internet now that their original platform is starting to decline. Only successful ones they have are ones they had to acquire   To eliminate their competition.

Yea it makes sense. I guess my only argument I could think of that might go against this is that the size of the mining network has steadily increased over the years. Wouldn’t that add to the amount of miners that each new block gets split up into? so even though it’s a smaller percentage now of halving isn’t the mining pool still way larger than what it would have been at during previous halvings?

During the bullish run when miners are incentivized to join in. A lot of the dips in price that happened during those times are prolly miners trying to recoup their costs or investments by dumping some of their coin into the market. I’m sure i’m probably wrong though,  bitcoin just does what bitcoin does.
@_date: 2019-08-13 19:46:28

If you want to OWN your bitcoin. You would want to use an exchange like coinbase, or cash app, probably what Evers easier for you. There are others as well, kraken is pretty popular. Then you can send the bitcoin you buy there to your own storage wallet for safekeeping. I would do some research on these topics if you aren’t sure like how exactly to setup your own wallets and how to send between them. How to manage your Keys, etc. There are other exchanges as well, some follow or don’t follow kyc laws/standards. With robinhood you can never withdraw the bitcoin you buy if you want. at least right now until they come up with their own wallet system for customers to move theirs around.
@_date: 2019-06-29 02:02:36
Yea you can’t send it anywhere with cash app at all without verifying. Like most services that let you purchase btc through them. I wish cash app would do a better job explaining that before convincing people to buy it on there.
@_date: 2019-12-08 01:28:42
Lol well good luck with refusing to pay your taxes. I am guessing you don’t have much invested in crypto or any other assets besides whatever your wages paid in fiat might be.

Bitcoin will never end its operations so it’s uptime will forever get closer to 100% without ever hitting it. Sort of like in math there’s no real Infiniti but we can somewhat quantify it by limits with how numbers behave as they get closer and closer to it. I’m prolly off a little but I sort of thought that’s the gist of it. Feel free to correct me anyone.

The ones actively trading or buying bitcoin know. That’s what really matters.
@_date: 2019-12-04 20:36:27
No, you pulled out. bitcoin doesn’t want you anymore.
@_date: 2019-12-06 13:25:58
As wise as it always was. Not very wise.
@_date: 2019-12-05 16:54:26
Not your keys not your coin. You are basically trading it’s spot price with robinhood. You can’t move it or keep it in your own wallet so therefore you aren’t holding real bitcoin. Similarly to how people trade gold etfs based on spot price but don’t own any physical bullion. Still, There are times where it would be much more beneficial to have it in bullion which would help preserve the value of your investment. If for some reason the bitcoin price went too high and robinhood didn’t have enough money to pay it out they could simply not pay you the full amount and you could have little to no recourse.

Probably. looks like we’ll be stuck waiting for lots of other problems to be solved.
@_date: 2019-12-06 21:01:34
To be fair right now if the US dollar would fail, every other currency right now would fail as well, as they are all tied to and leveraged against the dollar as the main global fiat currency.
@_date: 2019-12-02 21:00:08
Robinhood is not a wallet nor are you actually buying your own bitcoin from their service. You are basically just betting against robinhood on price speculation.
@_date: 2019-12-16 20:39:30
If you went all in at the 2017 bull run or bought a lot of it and never invested before that’s your own damn fault for being a stupid investor. Even in traditional markets someone would say those tactics would be fucking stupid and extremely risky. That’s still leaves basically what 6 months of the entire past 10 years now where your investment would be worth less.
@_date: 2019-12-28 23:47:30
Depending on what cash you are using when that happens you honestly could lose more value before you’d ever have a chance to buy back in time after it falls.
@_date: 2019-12-08 01:04:26
If you keep it in cash app then you had to at least give them your state Id and pretty sure your social to have the cash card as well as buy or send bitcoin because they have to follow the kyc laws like coinbase does. When you file taxes now you have to report most of your transactions. The irs can request your records if they feel the need to, it happened to a lot of coinbase accounts earlier this year. They couks make you pay for whatever previous taxes you might have owed if they ever did find out.

Would be fairly easy to solve if your good with a Rubik’s cube. Gimme it I’ll show you! Lol
@_date: 2019-12-07 15:46:47
Lol those jumps are still less than +/-0.5% while bitcoin pump and dumps are like +/- 5%.
@_date: 2019-12-31 13:45:22
It’s a joke at this point it’s sad most people don’t even think about these things whenever they actually haopen.
@_date: 2019-12-16 18:09:15
Bitcoin cash!

And they make like 100% of iPhones.
@_date: 2019-12-08 12:11:52
You are dumb
@_date: 2019-12-18 15:30:33
I get the first sentence. Everything we do with monetary policy I guess I’d consider intervention. from what I understand the repo activity is only between the fed and some of the largest banks/ lenders around correct?. Most of which ends up being lended back and forth with each other I thought before it gets out to the rest of the economy. Is that accurate? Idk I guess I’d ask should we really trust them again to not become too overleveraged if we have them the ability to do so.
@_date: 2019-12-17 21:00:19
Inflation hasn’t kicked in because every other economy has flooded their wealth into the usd after they all had no safe place to put it once their federal banks all started running negative. It’s just a matter of time here if they don’t change. We know now if they ever raise rates again it will create a panic in some of the markets which we already saw. We only have like what 1.5% to go before we are negative. Our federal reserve interest rate is now below the target inflation we have but it’s only been there for a short amount of time. Everyone can tell you what’s always happened before when repo markets have moved but this and most stuff we are doing with monetary policy hasn’t always been done in an environment anything like what we have now.
@_date: 2019-12-05 06:49:47
Ah yes always forget the Stone Age was followed by the... gold age...
@_date: 2019-12-13 19:00:22
I thought bitcoin.com is not legit and a scam?
@_date: 2019-12-09 20:29:35
Lol wtf is this shit how does this get posted here
@_date: 2019-12-27 19:04:49
It being an error makes less sense than the random widespread ban itself lol
@_date: 2019-12-02 21:58:14
Not saying you should or have too. But let’s say bitcoin skyrockets to 20k again and with all the cash robinhood took to buy “bitcoin” cheap they never bothered to verify and keep up with the amount they are supposed to be custodians of for all of the investors. Plus they are not even fdic insured so hypothetically, they would never have to legally pay you out money for the bitcoin that you gave them if you ever wanted the money or the bitcoin. Not your keys not your coin. Like I said you will probably be fine with short term price movements if you want. But if you are investing in bitcoin for long term this is how you lose your current dollars and future bitcoin all at once.
@_date: 2019-12-27 20:28:14
Isn’t this basically the concept of the stock to flow they always talk about that seems to be the most accurate backtested ways to track the prices past movements?
@_date: 2019-12-26 01:38:02
Economics. There will never be a 10 years for crypto that this last 10 years had as far as its growth in value. Do I still believe it has amazing long term value and growth, for sure. But It’s not going to go up that much and that fast ever again, let’s be real here. If your only investment other than savings is btc I think you should learn a little more about economics and investing in general before going all in or thinking that you have it all figured out.
@_date: 2019-12-16 23:20:02
You summed it up in your first paragraph. After the last one around $3200 you were thinking it was dead again. You are getting closer to that point again. When we all claim to be the cypherpunk we thought we were for so long then finally face some music and feel tested... traditional markets are leveraged to the tits and its only increasing faster. the time is nigh... lol
@_date: 2019-12-31 04:26:56
Not many people can be FOMOd in that haven’t been before yet at this point.
@_date: 2019-12-26 14:05:40
Well that escalated quickly
@_date: 2019-12-26 01:28:38
Lol yea because we first started hoarding and trading gold only 20 years ago...
@_date: 2019-12-26 01:34:04
No one is going to make that type of gain in that short of a time in bitcoin or any crypto ever again. Sorry. And comparing it to gold 20 years ago is redundant, compare it to gold when we first started hoarding it thousands of years ago.
@_date: 2019-12-17 21:12:40
Okay so why shouldn’t the banks just stop lending until they have the reserves required by law from their previous obligations/loans? So it’s the economies fault again that they are over leveraged? so let’s just keep doing anything and everything to prevent the markets from falling or so we can stop the economy from slowing forever. Well that’s always ended well historically. The more we seem to mess with shit and intervene seems like he more we fuck up. This infinite growth mentality can’t last forever.
@_date: 2019-12-28 23:55:26
I totally agree with you about denial of most of the community. Those are just the small minority that shouts the loudest online anyways. They wouldn’t ever be the ones that help bring about any of those changes anyways to help drive adoption. But others that do know their shit that are also investing and building onto the network to help bring more accessibility and security and all that are still going to be working on it.
@_date: 2019-12-31 04:32:56
Like that dude and all his buddies don’t have off shore bank accounts.

Old news...
@_date: 2019-09-09 20:34:25
They will once they all have stakes in it.
@_date: 2019-09-19 20:47:44
Once the general and non tech savvy public masses can get access to it. Accessibility and using it is still way to tedious for most people out there to take the time to figure it out. Even if some kind of understand or are interested in bitcoin it becomes another barrier.
@_date: 2019-09-28 16:58:10
It can be sinking or floating right now but the richest ones were mostly those that have been riding it the longest.
@_date: 2019-09-10 19:55:11
Honestly can’t stand seeing people be rude to tellers over issues with the bank itself. That’s like yelling at a cashier at a store over something that person has nothing to do with. But yea I’m a millennial with mobile and online banking. The only time I have to step in the bank seems to be if the atm outside is broken or out of cash when I stop there.
@_date: 2019-09-26 19:43:15
Unless it’s for alt coins or KYC preferences I don’t have any issue with coinbase and have never had a problem with them.
@_date: 2019-09-20 21:43:38
I wanna see the results. Idk who wouldnt say none of the above.
@_date: 2019-09-09 18:02:52
The caption under the chart says bitcoin rose sharply this year due to the likes of Twitter and fb... if I’m not mistaken no one was talking about it until after it rose like 200-300% in 1-2 months again. Fb didn’t even mention libra until after then.
@_date: 2019-09-25 14:09:35
Why would they destroy it when just holding onto it would accomplish the same results. Except after the price raises they might be able to get something for it instead of it being lost forever.
@_date: 2019-09-25 16:49:11
It’s for the fees! You don’t have to pay any coinbase fee if you have the cash on there first then move it to the exchange or just deposit it to the exchange to buy once the cash is available to use.
@_date: 2019-09-27 19:48:26
The only way you can manipulate the price is with large amounts of money and buying up enough to drive it up, or selling a lot to drop it down. But you are stuck with whatever price it is at as well so it likely doesn’t work in your favor. On the other hand it seems like the stock market can be manipulated by laws,regulations, accounting practices, dishonest reporting, taxpayer bailouts. The list goes on.
@_date: 2019-09-03 20:56:29
Was wondering why bitcoin started jumping up again today.
@_date: 2019-09-27 15:13:58
Can you send the bitcoin you purchase on cashapp to another wallet if you want yet?
@_date: 2019-09-26 18:28:50
Cuz his ass farted out those random numbers and he just likes them. Like everyone’s price targets.
