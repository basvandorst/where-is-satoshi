I couldn't agree less. with 2mb blocks since genesis, the main chain would be close to exceeding 500gb right now, so no more cheap 500gb hdds. 
also, nobody advocates never increasing the blocksize, but most developers prefer increase in effectivity before touching the size itself. (by increasing the size you remove the incentive to improve the protocol).
everyone who misses the blocksize increase is in luck, there's a shitcoin just for that!

absolutely, global social consensus is one of the most complicated problems I can think of, but at the same time one that seems to be worth solving. I recognize the disparity and wealth distribution, however this has to go far beyond nation states. Also, I think that distinguishing between rich and poor in language causes differences in our reality.   
Ideally, we would create a new language to talk about being human, with words stripped of their legacy meanings, politics and simplifications, but honestly I doubt that can happen. If we can't change the language in which we understand each other, we should at least adopt a suitable tone for these discussions.
regarding your comments on printing money, it's again a problem that will be hard to solve. easy way to solve a hard problem is to skip it, assume (bet/risk) it's not a cause but rather has a cause and then solve it one layer above.

In many instances his principle of fixing stuff on base layer instead of downstream makes a lot of sense, I just don't see it in this very case.

thank you for putting this down, makes much more sense now. 
I had a knucklehead assumption that btc was somehow 'swapped' without a direct TX between output of channel opening and input of channel closing.
@_date: 2019-07-10 12:08:02
yes, and this already happened (with BitPay, banks, exchanges, ...). you need to however distinguish the part where the link between TX and ID is **outside of the system.**   
this means that yes, it's pretty accurate to make predictions over big set of data and huge population of users, but when you want to apply it to the individual, i.e. it's getting MUCH more complicated.
Say I have 1BTC under address X, and I pay you 0.5BTC to address Y. TX will consume address X, send 0.5 to address Y and (my change) another 0.5 to address Z. 
tell me officer, am I Z or Y?

@_date: 2019-07-26 13:16:38


I am 100% for privacy, and I think you absolutely have to hide your groceries TX, because (on main chain) the change will be routed into a new address under your wallet, and then some dust ends up being a part of input into your donation to WikiLeaks or Tor project, for example.
At the same time, I don't like the drawbacks most of CT solutions bring much more. If looping thru LN will break the link between main chain adresses, it should be enough to ridicule KYC/AML effectively.

because every altcoin is a misunderstanding of what bitcoin is.   
Bitcoin is many things no shitcoin is even trying to be. It is the single biggest (and by FAR) network of digital human consensus. It's a proof that a consensus can be achieved digitally. 
Every single shitcoin out there skips the groundwork and implements a non-existent use case. Once a 'crypto project' find something useful, its devs would quickly find out that not only they can't compete with robustness of Bitcoin, but also any script kitty can now fork their solution and build it on top of existing consensus - bitcoin.

exactly this, coupled with the common idea to onboard new users directly onto LN. 
however, if this is the case then his analogy with internet is not precise - because the internet uses a number of protocols at the same time, bitcoin and LN is exclusive (it's one or the other), it's not possible to propagate the identity between the layers.

one of us does not understand the protocol. afaik if you only changed the blocksize but keep the diff algo same, it will enforce a block every 10 mins regardless of its size, therefore your claim of having half as many blocks seems ridiculous tbh. 
half as many blocks means new block is found less often, i.e. every 20 mins instead. how is that scaling?

if I use LN nodes to transfer over LN, how is that not LN? How is that a mixer if nothing is mixed? (mixer mixes inputs and outputs with other participants, but in this scenario there is 1 input and 1 output - nothing is mixed).
The amount won't even be the same, if I start with 1BTC I likely end up with \~0.99 on the output due to the fees.
@_date: 2019-07-26 11:26:54


I am not sure if this is the case, since my understanding is that each node only know 1 hop radius in the path, not origin and endpoint of the TX.

Andreas is often arguing for privacy on base layer and that LN should not be a solution to privacy, but I just don't see how is that same analogy as with internet protocols.

Why is LN not good enough as a means of privacy for bitcoin?

tbh I feel I am also not knowledgeable enough to be sure, and with Andreas being very persistent on this makes me feel there's something I don't see, but even knowing this, I still don't see the merit in his argument. 
My layman understanding of internet layering is that you **can** reconstruct a higher layer data from lower level if you know how (for example if I sniff your packets, I can tell you were watching Justin Bieber on YT), but with bitcoin, lighning TXs do not consist of TXs of main chain layer - that's why I don't see the analogy with TCP/IP.   
might be I am not correct in my understanding of the internet, though.

bitcoin elites will however not be incentivized to 'invest' deflating money into real estate and contracts, if just holding bitcoin itself outperforms any other option.

If you are in a situation of absolute abundance, it is also much easier to be nice to people, especially if you remember being in similar situation. A number of nerds will have unparalleled power to do good and to leave a legacy/impact. It works much better if done altruistically.

paper wallets were reasonable before hardware wallets were a thing. to recreate similar security is much harder  on a paper wallet (air gapped computer). HW also gives you a very safe way to interact with your addresses and it handles the issue to generate new address for each TX for you among other things.
At the same time, if you use a HW to generate the seed and few addresses, then destroy the HW, you basically end up with a paper wallet.

you are not necessarily disagreeing with me either. if Confidential transactions required a soft fork, and this is backwards compatible, users will have optional anonymity, which defies it's purpose as you mention.
Nobody argues against implementing solutions later that are not yet available, but with the argument of the slot for base layer changes closing, it makes that a little weird.

using different passphrases as different "accounts", if your seed is compromised, attacker might have access only to the base wallet without passphrase. This way, you can set up multiple "accounts" on your wallets with negligible amounts (for you) and in the unlikely scenario of 5$ attack, you can spill one of the accounts after few slaps.
question is, how to make passphrases that are hard to brute force yet easy to remember.

with schnorr it wouldn't be easy to distinguish multisig schemes from basic TX, however schnorr does not try to hide the trail of public ledger, means that If I take your ID when you purchase btc to address ABC123, then proceed to make TXs you leave a trail.

that was likely 10yrs ago when bitcoin was quite a different animal.   
However, if we can minimize the barrier for entry to running a full node, the decentralization will react to the network naturally. When all is good, people's nodes will fuck up over time and they won't have incentive to set up a new one immediately. However if there is a known attack on Bitcoin or at least a threat, network would react and many nodes will pop up out of nowhere.
Also, with TOR implementation being more and more ~~user~~ noob friendly, we might never know the actual number of nodes.

well, you still have satoshi's stash^(TM)   which is believed to be 1 mil btc. Considering current circulating supply, it's a fraction (1/17 or 1/14 without 'lost coins'). If the trully lost coins can never resurface and losing coins will never stop, we will inevitably end up in a timeline when some avg hodler's stash from 2016 can be more significant that satoshi's one milion in comparison to total supply.

yes, there are too many threads here where people are trying to restore few years old seed. Also, your security depends very much on which words you change the order specifically and how.  
it is MUCH safer to keep the seed intact, and add a passphrase/passphrases even with very small entropy, for example if my passphrase is "fuck", it still prevents you from immediately swiping my private key even if you find my SEED unless you guess it, hopefully giving me enough time to move them sooner.
At the end of the day, you must be able to manage number of seeds easily. are you going to remember how you flipped the words in all of them? because you can easily use the same passphrase through all your seeds without breaching your security.

* spending from the address exposes the public key, which means that if you do this for multiple addresses in the same wallet, chain analysis can see they all have the same public key - you show that these belong together. This is not a concern when you only receive, so basically the rule goes on*ce you spend from an address, spend it all* (modern wallets do this for you and route any change to a new change address you control, and *never send bitcoin to an address that was used to spend*. For your use case (only buying and sending form exchange), it's completely fine.
* So you have to spend some of what you bought (doesn't matter if for a friend or otherwise). If you send your friend any TX directly to his address on his hardware wallet, and all BTC you have is on one address (say u have 20BTC, and sending your friend 1BTC) - hardware wallet will create 2 outputs form your reused address. 1. with 1BTC to your friend, 2. with 19BTC back to you, but a diff, fresh address. At this point you are fine, but for next purchases on the exchange have your hardware wallet generate yet another new address and use it until you need to spend from it. Once you do that, again, just generate a new one and use that.
additional suggestion: I would actually add in one wallet in between my and my friends HW, so the TX would go from my HW --&gt; my mobile wallet --&gt; my friends HW. This way, you have plausible deniability of one extra hop on a private key you don't need to use later in case your friend is a noob and does something sketchy.

exchanges rotate a small fraction of bitcoin discovering the price for those sats that are not up for sale. If the demand exceeds the available amount, the price will go crazy again.

it's the reason why bitcoin is decentralized. Every new block (every TX in it) needs to be validated against the existing blockchain and also valid consensus rules. In centralized systems you would have a server to do that. Bitcoin is a cool cookie because there is no central server, only full validating nodes, and thousands of them.
each node means an identical copy of Bitcoin's history. This is a core of the solution how we prevent spending the same coin twice. There are just too many people having all the info and validating everything all the time. Fooling one person does not help (as it would with a central server) because honest nodes will realize the fraud and ban its source.
Running a node is getting easier every month, if you do it consider it as a super steep learning curve. With a node, you help being one more honest drop in the ocean to keep the scammers at bay and you don't need to rely on someone else telling you how much bitcoin you have on your wallets (every wallet needs a full node/bitcoin history, but most providers will allow you to use theirs).
In any case, try it even if you fail, you will definitely learn something cool along the way.
@_date: 2019-10-16 10:26:06
what helped me understand TXs was to realize that your bitcoin never sits in more than one address at the time. If you send a TX from address A to address B, then until it's confirmed, bitcoin sits in address A. Wallet that controls address B will show you 'incoming amount' almost instantly because it sees the amount in the mempool, but will allow you to use that amount only if confirmed.  
If you use 1sat/byte during a busy time, your TX might not be mined for days. I think there is a  timeout in mempool to discard a TX after 72hours or so, but many wallets will rebroadcast the same TX again when this happens. With this, you might get into a state where it seems that your bitcoin is locked from you - but it's not, because if it's not confirmed, it still sits in address A, and you can create a different TX from A to C with higher fee and have that one confirmed instead. If you do this, the original transaction from A to B is invalid, because at that time, A does not have sufficient funds \[because they sit under address C form subsequent TX\].

yes it does but the article is not only entirely oblivious to it, it's also mixing a custodial exchange wallet (namely Conbase) with software wallets like mycelium, which are tremendously different in who owns the private key.


Bitcoin Core wallet is a standard implementation. It is a source for every wallet provider/dev to not reinvent the wheel. Also, it implements all available features especially the ones a number of SW wallets omits as they are more prone to user error.
Also, any wallet works exactly the same as Bitcoin Core, in regards that it needs to have the entire block history downloaded, but when you use third party app, it connects to (default) full node that is operated by wallet provider. This is a security risk and while it might not matter for some transactions, it is completely unacceptable for others.

not to nitpick and I don't like the metaphor either, but if all they did was hashing the block header, they would get the same hash every time. With adjusting nonce, you kind of try/guess a combination of input that provides acceptable output.

seeds have checksum, if an attacker finds a seed, they 100% know what it is, but it won't be valid. This means any attacker knows it has been played around with. Since you are keeping it simple so you can remember it, you are simplifying this whole thing for the attacker tremendously.
on the contrary, if you find a seed that has a passphrase on it, the seed without the passphrase is a valid seed, it just doesn't hold your bitcoin at any address that is generated without the passphrase. There is no easy way to tell if the seed is protected with a passphrase or not. It is very easy to tell that the order of seed had been messed around with.

I generally agree with your well versed argument. Regarding anarchy, however, I would argue that anarchy already exists \[and always existed\] in any social context that lacks authority that enforces rules. IMO anarchy should be recognized as an integral force of our democracy. If people can prove that they can organize and behave without rules being enforced, they should be free to do that. Without anarchy, democracy is very shortlived. case in point: thousands of people around the world have been arrested for peaceful demonstration in last 10 days.  
Regarding bitcoin underwhelming UX, don't expect too much improvement in UX from development perspective. Some bugs will be fixed, some UI screens will be optimized, some warning messages will be standardized, but the big change will come from societies adopting bitcoin. For example, if you are a member of a pension club for example, your peers will suggest suitable apps they know how to work with \[that might be optimized for pensioners\] and will teach you how to use the software in social context.   
We are expecting one app to fit all purposes, but rarely consider that from security perspective.  


to some extent this is already our reality and how I use my mobile wallet today. But from the other side of the perspective: what is the point in polishing the mobile wallet app UI now, if LN integration fucks everything up? The protocol is changing and new layers are being integrated. The million dollar idea for a wallet will be absolutely obvious once the protocol is standardized enough.

spend some time researching what you actually do when you make a TX. If you send btc from address A (say coinbase) to address B (your ledger) - the reason why you see the btc in the ledger is because Ledger (company) is hosting a blockchain explorer (essentially a full node with a web UI, really), and your device asks this explorer "what's the balance on these public keys" (simplified)
In order to be sure, you can spin your own full node that downloads the whole blockchain, and check your balances against that, instead of trusting Ledger's blockchain explorer. At the same time, you need to realize what would it take for Ledger to trick you into thinking you have btc when you don't, and also if your stack is worth it for them to catch the fire for it (it would be easily provable they cheated you).
There is a middle ground, paste the receiving address B into 3 different blockchain explorers, if all 3 of them say your address received the amount, it should be reasonably safe to assume that the whole world is not colluding to trick you.

also, congrats for great results in the posted review. BTW, Is there a 24 word version of blockplate or does one simply use 2?

this should get stickied, incredible work!

provided it was not his donations, yep.
on the side note, I think you specifically would be very pleased to hear that there is a BCH dev team named bcash. don't have any bch to donate so I'm sending them hugs and kisses!

not many people realize that not buying BTC is also a speculation. Strictly speaking, when you breathe out, you speculate that you'll be able to breathe in later. All we do is speculation.

good first step could be to stop looking for a single solution to every problem.


some problems will arise, some will fade. without central govt education you'll have much less effective propaganda. TIL that kids do the pledge of alliance every day? LOL?  
education is going to change anyway. since the number of people with uni diploma is constantly rising, the advantage of having it is decreasing. it's becoming more important what you are able to do, not to what you have papers for. right now, if you spend 4 years learning to code you are going to live in more abundance than any and all schools could provide. How many people are in the army for free uni?
Can a surgeon study online? Problematic. Can a lawyer study online? Absolutely.  
Most pressing issues are not going to have a catch-all solution. These are only causing more problems.

 how is betting on bitcoin's price jumping in? do you also bet on UFC so you can jump in on being a fighter?

we are all learning similar lessons with different amounts of money.
@_date: 2019-06-27 14:57:13
because I am sure that majority of your taxes are being spent on teachers' salaries. Moreover, a good chunk of education can be done online. There is always middle ground, almost everything is a scale not a black and white dichotomy. Ignoring this is a cause of majority of social issues, especially in the west.
you don't have to chose between 100% communism, 100% capitalism and 100% anarchy.
solidarity between healthy and sick works in a number of countries, does it mean everyone is a communist?
same solidarity does not work between the rich and the poor, does it mean everyone is a capitalist?
this is just so tiring to witness tbh.

how can anyone be afraid that Bitcoin will ever go away if even BCH refuses to die despite virtually nobody using it.
@_date: 2019-06-21 08:15:24
your seed phrase is a representation of your private key, it is 100% your access to bitcoin, which can be used cross most modern wallets.

if I buy 1 sat from you for 10 EUR, would it be unnatural?

MLM uses the money input from newcomers on the lowest level to pay out dividents to levels above, all works fine   while it grows, once the influx of new people stops, there is no new money.
bitcoin is a protocol and doesn't have 'user accounts', doesn't distinguish people, there are only addresses, and all are equal (in computer systems, often it's much easier to implement equality because it means *no code*, while inequality would need a lot of code to enforce structure).
@_date: 2019-06-26 17:38:50
now cross reference it.
first point is that
*A: sudden rise is* ***not natural***.
your opposite take is that
*B: sudden rise is* ***not because of adoption.***
These are slightly different statements. Is it possible that your bias is showing here?
next statement is
*A:  Nothing special has happened* ***in this time frame*** *to justify the price spike.*
You are proposing that news are correlated to the price, so the opposite would be that news have no impact on price, therefore
*B: nothing special needed to happen* ***ever*** *to justify the current price spike.*
where I am going is that you are not considering the possibility that everything is natural, and this is exactly how adoption works, by individuals acting in their best interest based on their current options (if I can make profit pump n dumpin I should do it, if I can't, I should hodl, for example)

just stack sats. in the end game, having 10btc, 1btc or 0.1 btc will not have much practical difference.

i like the center punch approach, should be reasonably doable on your own.

when you receive btc from LN channel to a fresh wallet, afaik there is nothing for anyone to trace (no previous TX)

human mind suck at probability anyway. if you flip a coin 9 times in a row, and it's tails for 9 times, we expect that 10th throw has more probability to be heads. 
subscribe to dev mailing list and check the discussion every so often, it will give you a perspective of how many and how smart people are working on the coolest things the whole time.

@_date: 2019-06-26 16:50:05
whenever you are 100% sure you know what's up and everyone else seems stupid, check your bias. thing is that most of the time, your bias will make you focus on a fitting perspective. ask why and how could it be exactly the opposite of what I feel now?

this is such a tired argument. if shipping company uses roads, they will pay taxes and their service price will adjust accordingly. also, tolls are a thing.


while not a good argument for taxing everybody, you raised an important issue here.

I don't agree on the most sophisticated tools tbh. It's just fucking maths. What they however have is data. It's not that interesting. Certainly not as interesting as what is happening in Bitcoin right now.  
i'll be interested to know how their onboarding process and capacity changed post Snowden.

also check out hardware wallets, namely Trezor or Ledger and eventually move your coins there, they give you a lot more security abstracted out without much hassle.

also, it's much easier to create a quantum resistant cryptography than to use quantum to break current cryptography. same way there were computer programs/algos and scripts before any computers existed.

meanwhile bitcoin works as designed, generating a block roughly every 10 minutes, for roughly 10 years. yup, shit's never gonna work.
