Yes, we should definitely find a technical solution.
But just for arguments sake, I don't think self regulation works at all over the long term. It might have worked right now, and I sight might because it's impossible to tell how much miners switched to other pools or if ghash is just hiding their hashing power better for now.
But self regulation in principle can only work if the offending party has an interest in being a part of the bitcoin ecosystem, if anyone just sets out to hurt or destroy bitcoin without directly wanting to profit from it, self regulation is useless. 
And I personally don't want a system that allows that.

By proofing that it's entirely possible for somebody to gain 51% hashing power. It's a fundamental problem with bitcoin that way too many people disregarted previously. Maybe/hopefully now something technical can be done, instead of people relying on hate/ddos/attack posts to prevent somebody getting past 50%. 
It's a huge problem, better it's escalating now than later.

I'd say thank you Ghash. They've shown that self-regulation just doesn't work and that bitcoin has a fundamental problem that too many people just ignored previously.
There will always be greedy people, people putting short term profit over long term viability or just plainly irrational actors.
Maybe now something technical can be done, just ignoring the underlying problems of bitcoin will eventually lead to disaster.
