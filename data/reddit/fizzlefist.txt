Offer to buy bitcoins on criagslist via paypal... got it!
@_date: 2013-04-11 21:28:02
Assuming both of these services were up and running and you were already set up to receive the cash, absolutely.  Buy on one, transfer bitcoins to the other, profit!
@_date: 2013-04-11 19:48:55
Exactly.  If you bought at the peak and you don;t urgently need what you could get for them now, just hold onto them.  Stick them in a save encrypted wallet, make several paper backups in safe places, and forget about it.

Deposited $300 the other day, fee was $6.72

I actually just searched Kickstarter for any bitcoin related projects earlier today.  Had an idea to use Raspberry Pi's (cheap computer) into pre-configured offline-wallets.  Receive it in the mail, plug it in, get your wallet set up, and then store the Pi and SD card in a safe place.
But I don't have the know how to do something like that, not to mention the legalities of selling something like that using existing wallet/linux software.

I sent in an email to bitfloor support on July 6 because I've lost my 2-factor authenticion key. Still waiting for a response, but I'm being patient.
@_date: 2013-04-02 21:07:12
I've done 2 deposits with bitfloor so far, both under $500, and they haven't for an ID yet.
@_date: 2013-04-14 17:38:34
I use BitFloor for buying in and normal trading.  When I go to cash out, I double check CoinBases current sell value, then use them to sell and direct deposit USD to my bank account.  Seems to work pretty well so far.
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:56:26
And a lot of bills that can now be put into savings or having a higher standard of living.

[Clearly, there is a demand here...](
@_date: 2013-04-14 17:34:59
Yep, that's how I got in shortly before the spike and crash.  Bitfloor is a piece of cake to deposit to and the localtill fees are quite reasonable.
I used CoinBase to cash out and diret deposit to my bank account when the price started to fall.  Now I'm back in using BitFloor.
@_date: 2013-04-17 23:15:41
Yeah... shit, I had a buy order set for if the price dropped a few bucks more.  Well, guess I'll just have to be patient to get my $350 back.

@_date: 2013-12-03 19:34:41
Same here.  I deposited 0.05 BTC into a BitCoinTip account back before Bitfloor died when the going rate was around $105.  Now that's worth a little over $50.  No idea what to do with it, lol.
@_date: 2013-04-03 00:14:47
Make two printouts.  Store one someplace safe in the house, store the other with yer important documents in a safety deposit box.
@_date: 2013-04-17 22:55:59
Well fuck... I didn't find out until a few minutes ago, and I had an open order. Guess I'm gonna have to wait for them to figure out how to get my cash back.
@_date: 2013-07-06 20:43:27
Will do.
@_date: 2013-04-11 19:47:26
55USD on bitfloor right now
@_date: 2013-04-02 21:08:20
Only downside is it takes 3-5 business days to clear and your BTC to become available.  I used them for my first bitcoin purchase 2 weeks ago, and I've been using bitfloor ever since.
@_date: 2013-03-29 00:51:43
Bough for the first time last weekend at $63, and I've been waiting through this whole bubble for it to process. :(  Should've started with bitfloor, I guess.
@_date: 2013-07-06 20:15:57
Horay!  Now I just have to get my account unlocked since my phone got wiped a month or so ago and I've lost my authentication keys...
@_date: 2013-04-14 17:41:59
Pretty much.  You get an out of state deposit slip, check off NY on the list of states (or whatever the instruction email says), fill in the account number and write down the exact amount to the penny that bitfloor said to depot.  Make sure you keep the deposit slip until you get a confirmation email.  I've used them 3 times so far for deposits between $100 and $300, and the funds were available on BitFloor within 15-30 minutes.
No need for a signiture or ID the three times I've done it, but BofA may ask.
@_date: 2013-07-06 20:17:29
I don't think any of us expected the whole thing to have its account frozen with about 30 minutes' notice.  Hope you get your money out without much trouble.
@_date: 2013-04-02 21:06:10
This. No dealing with moneygram or any other complex/annoying services. Go to your nearest BoA, fill out an out-of-state deposit slip from the directions, deposit your cash, and its in your bitfloor account by the time you get home.
@_date: 2013-04-11 19:44:09
Sold at $225, doubled my investment.  Bitfloor is currently trading at $55, I may buy back in again.

Coinbase, though they use Authy instead of Google Authenticator.
@_date: 2013-04-11 21:06:10
Assuming that's true (as BTC hasn't been above $200 for over 24 hours now), congrats.  Now contact an accountant and make sure your taxes will be in order.
@_date: 2013-03-31 14:01:18
Yeah, I was able to buy a small amount last weekend when they were trading at 63 USD via coinbase, though it took through Thursday to clear.  I used bitfloor's cash deposit method to add another $100 and the fee was somewhere around $2.60, and it was available before I got home from the Ba of America I deposited at.

Collaborate.  LISTEN!
@_date: 2013-04-03 16:11:03
aaaaand I know what I'm going to do with that Raspberry Pi that's been sitting on my desk for a month.
Small little offline wallet.  :)
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:58:53
Don't forget your taxes! The IRS don't mess around, and most of us don't have the experiences and connections to avoid them and get away with it.

Alge-Blaster was where it was at!

Not a scam, just a gamble.  The house always wins, and you (should) know that before you play.

I put up an MP3 player for sale on BitMit, but no bites so far... I've also added BitCoin as an acceptable form of payment on some of my craigslist listings.  Should be an interesting exchange if someone takes me up on that, not sure how it'd go logistically.
