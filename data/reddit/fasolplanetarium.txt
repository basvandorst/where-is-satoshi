Oh boy, again with the market cap stuff...
@_date: 2018-05-13 15:59:14
Right there with ya buddy. Cheers.

Cue insane price predictions and in kind, classic 'market cap rebuttals'. 
Never ends.

OP, I sincerely do not say this as an indictment of you, your wife, or your marriage, but your concerns are, well, disconcerting. If you can't talk to (and celebrate with!) your wife about a smart investment, you guys need to work on communication.
 It saddens me that you are genuinely concerned she would simply drop her job or a divorce would ensue because of this.This reminds me of the type of spouse who would 'turn you in' to the police - I just cannot wrap my head around that minute an amount of trust in an ostensibly *indefinite* relationship.  I am very happily (and healthily) married, in part because I can tell my wife anything and always know we are on the same team. I cannot fathom my wife ever acting so selfish or impulsive. 
I would be far more concerned with securing your money and filing the proper taxes because this kind of money will create bigger problems than a disgruntled spouse. That said, I don't know your marriage nor am I aware of any extenuating circumstances for your anticipating this kind of behavior from your *spouse* but I do know it shouldn't be happening in a healthy marriage, period.
Again, not an indictment - just something I had to say with empathic concern. I truly hope you guys work this out and fix whatever must have happened along the way to make hiding money from her the rational choice. 
 Good luck dude, and congrats on your investment and formidable HODLing!
Edit: rereading OP, it seems like you're being more preemptive, asking 'what-if' here than actually anticipating so my apologies if I just inadvertently dissed your marriage.

Of course everyone is downvoting your post because   is spot on and they all know it. Typical Reddit BS.

I'm still somewhat a n00b with BTC cryptocurrencies. Mind explaining or sending me to a link? 
@_date: 2017-10-16 16:31:43
Totally misread his comment. Makes sense and yeah, agreed...which is why I did buy some.
@_date: 2017-10-16 13:56:14
Thanks for the reply. Yeah, I'm not genuinely upset about it - logically, one could say we miss these opportunities every day plus all the other circumstances (like the one you mentioned - selling them off. def likely). I think it's kinda funny/cool. Would love to hear about even closer calls, or people who sold early or lost their coins etc.

There's an archived post around Reddit from 2015 where this guy was 99% sure he was going to take out a 30k loan and spend it all on BTC. Everyone called him a dumbass. Right now he would closing in on 600k. 
Regardless, taking out a loan 'to invest' is not investing, it's speculating...maybe even gambling. That said, shit can (and DOES) happen. I would stick to the golden rule here: *do NOT 'invest' more than you are willing to lose.*

Actually, not in this instance, but otherwise you would be correct. I noted I planned 'to forget' about it. I had done a LOT of reading and looked at tons of projections and decided the best course of action would be to wait five years (aka 'forget about it'). Yeah, I might have sold them, but there *are* people who bought BTC way back in 2010 and cashed in this year, so it IS possible. 
Agreed on the 'only invest what you are willing to lose' ethos. 
@_date: 2017-10-16 14:08:54
Frustrating, isn't it!?
@_date: 2018-04-23 05:01:55
I really don't give a shit about your opinion. Thx.

Agreed. There are plenty of options for those who hate Coinbase, always have been. Just put in the effort to use them, guys...or shut up. Nobody is forcing you to use Coinbase. 
Besides, 90% of the bs Coinbase 'does' is due to your bank. So if you want to point fingers, blame your bank. (E.g. the 'cash advance' fee was verified to be major banks' doing, NOT Coinbase). 
Being able to buy major crypto assets with the click of a button is going to come with a price. Let Coinbase fuck up - it's just incentivization for other people to come along and do it better. 
@_date: 2018-04-23 05:00:07
Yup. And you have every right to go use a different exchange. I never said Coinbase didn't suck.
