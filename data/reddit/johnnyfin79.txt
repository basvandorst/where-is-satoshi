I made a long post a few weeks ago on how I sold my LiteCoin  (bought the night before the 350% spike. Tried to lock in profits and figured I could buy back in lower. I'm not letting go this time.

Nice "Get off my lawn response."
Why not make an educated comment addressing the question. For the value of your precious BitCoin to appreciate, you need new investors to believe in the technology of BitCoin. When new players come into the "Cryptocurrencey" revolution, they'll be asking important questions like these before they put their money down. If they get dinosaur responses like yours,  chances are, their money will flow into other coins with technologies they have better answers for.

Are you talking about Block confirmation time? I've been trading on both platforms for a few weeks but with other coins. Usually takes a few minutes for ETH/LTC/XRP etc

Anybody think we'll get through this 10 million dollar wall at 10k?
@_date: 2018-05-11 06:46:44
I'm saying i don't see a retest of those levels since every time we drop, the huuuuge buys are still there. 100k plus buys and lots of them. That's smart money if u ask me.

Ofcourse. Hey thx for the response.

Dude if 1 BTC is worth 300K, and fiat disappears soon thereafter, and there are only 25 million BTC in supply, and BTC is one of the main means to pay for everything in the world,  it will most definitely NOT have a value of $1. I don't feel like doing math, but if the current total value of all monies in the world currently is tens of trillions, pretty sure u divide that by 25 million and there u have your BTC value.
