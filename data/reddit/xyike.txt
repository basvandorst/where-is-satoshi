I am looking for the same thing, for the same age audience.  Have you found anything good that you would recommend?

Outside of attending your class ... any recommendations on how I introduce my kids to btc or cryptocurrency?  Would love a good introductory book if you have something in mind.

Despite all of the Coinbase recommendations, that isn’t allowed for people under 18.

That’s hilarious. 
You:  “Are you a wage slave?”
Also you:  “I have no money.”
You are like a human meme.

I have my account which I’ve never traded with, and then there is my sons account. I convinced him (11) to put a couple hundred in during the 2017 run up. Down to about 80 earlier this year, I decided to start trading. Ummmmmmm what a shitshow. I can’t do much right in terms of picking the swings. If I could somehow just “do the opposite” of what I’ve been doing, I’d be good. I’m simply gambling though.
