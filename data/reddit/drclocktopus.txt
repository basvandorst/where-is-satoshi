Can someone explain how to stop losing so much in fees? I wanted to trade ¬0.0095 btc to alts so transferred from my wallet to an exchange. The wallet told me ¬0.0065 btc would make it, the rest fees. Set fee for 10 verifications, Transaction approves in about 4 hours. I look at my exchange wallet and have ¬0.0046 btc, 17.6% taken by mining fee. So, I have lost half of this lot of bitcoin only in preparation. How can I prevent this in the future?

So what I am understanding here is that due to the data size of my transaction being relitively large compared to my small amount in transfer value, it is eating up a large percentage. The way I would avoid this is to wait until my funds are a bit more consolidated and therefore coming from the minimum number of addresses before making transactions? Also enable RBF and probably look at something better than electrum (should after the hack anyway).

Would your current degree allow you to do a masters in computer science? Obviously a small amount if any will be blockchain related but it should give you a good understanding of software from which you can develop massively employable skills.
