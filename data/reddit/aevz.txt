If you get good + fast, call shots (I will create this projected idea in this amount of time, give or take), can make quick changes and communicate how long those changes will take, while also putting boundaries for what you won't do, sure!
Keep at it!
I started out of sheer curiosity and a deep itch I could not get rid of. Took about 2 years of noodling, 1 year of hustling, and 1 year of making things I wanted at a certain level that is innately within me.
YOU CAN DO IT.

Cinema is more for 3d broadcast (as opposed to Maya and full-blown movies, but these days you can use various programs all across the board).
If you wanna learn motion graphics, get a copy of After Effects (not gonna say how), and check out some mograph channels on vimeo, r/motiondesign, r/animation, r/aftereffects, r/vfx, and check out some simple tutorials on schoolofmotion.com, find some lynda tutorials, and most importantly, GIVE YOURSELF A PROJECT, and commit to it. I would rather learn this way than through tutorials (but tutorials will walk you through the interface, which has its learning curve), and as you slog through your project, you will come across challenges that you can then google specifically for how to solve them.
GO FOR IT.
It's a great pursuit and incorporates so many artforms, and motion design is mainly for TV/film/video, but the principles can carry over to videogames and web as well (but you gotta learn entirely different workflows and software).
It's great!
It's doable! Go for it!

Looks like you are indeed correct. I reckon it was created in After Effects, or After Effects + Illustrator. Well done (to the OP)!
