localbitcoins.com isn't a payment system.  Some people selling use payment systems, which also require verification and have fun getting funds into them with your debit card.  The rest want cash in hand, like meet at a gas station - you got the money I got the stuff kinda deal.
No thanks.

What outrageous fees?
Thank bank transfer fees on the bank side.  You know, the shit you guys bitch about CONSTANTLY.

Nothing.  I am verified on Bitstamp.  Now I have the 'freedom' to pay outrageous fees and wait for days to do an International Bank Transfer if I want to buy BTC on Bitstamp.

Oh how well you know me.

I can understand that to a certain extent, but let's be honest.  I can buy whatever I want with my debit card on Amazon, sign up for Netflix, buy shit on ebay.  I can do it instantly, I don't have to verify fuck all and even if I did I don't have to wait days and days and then do an International Bank Transfer.  
So after all the verification, why can't I use my bank card?

Yeah I'm going to go ahead and pass on going through a bunch of steps to claim a fraction of a fraction of a penny.
Thanks, though.

I know you're being sarcastic but that is absolutely what this feels like.  I went through the verification process on Bitstamp and that was aggravating as all get out, only to find out that the only way for me to buy Bitcoins after being verified is through an International Bank Transfer.  
What year is it?!  This is so counter productive.  This defeats the purpose entirely.  This is so incredibly frustrating.
