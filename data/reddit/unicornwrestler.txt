Only valid argument against Bitcoin I’ve heard so far
@_date: 2019-07-19 14:58:48
BetterHash drastically improves decentralisation. I see ‘ultimate decentralisation’ as an unobtainable perfection but definitely something that we should aim towards and can get / are getting gradually better at. 
I’m sure you’re already aware that level 2 scaling solutions are progressing healthily. Transactions can also be batched which will ease any scaling difficulties we may have in future. 
So I would agree that you’ve very accurately assessed the areas where the most improvement can and will be made... But I probably wouldn’t go as far as saying they’re arguments against bitcoin / reasons why it can’t work. 
Enjoy your day!

Bitcoin has ‘constant varying value’ was the original comment. I said that Gold does too.
For us to discuss which one has the most variation / fluctuation in price you would have to concede my original point. 
What you’re talking about is a different conversation but one I would be willing to have if you’re interested.
@_date: 2019-07-19 13:50:57
If you’re so confident it will fail, put your money where your mouth is and short it!
Or perhaps you lack the conviction and you’re all talk. 
Lastly, being able to hang something around your neck is not an important criteria for a store of value. That is such a bizarre assertion I don’t even know where to begin.
Have a fantastic day!

In a deflationary economy loans are unnecessary because there is actual wealth instead of debt servitude.

You’re helping me to understand this?
Really? 
@_date: 2017-12-14 13:17:33
1. Your flawed assumption is that spending needs stimulating. 
If you were hungry, would you swap currency for food? Yes, you already do with fiat. It’s the same with cryptos.
2. Another flawed assumption. Why do you assume owning cryptos will always yield higher returns than other investments? They won’t. 
3. Yes it is inflationary for a reason. The reason is that our financial system relies upon debt. Without increasing debt, the system collapses. Inflation increases the debt and enables those who own assets to benefit from the inflation driven wealth redistribution while those who do not own assets have their wealth eroded. 
If you like the sound of that you must belong to the small group of people who stand to gain from it.

20% inflation might sound ‘crazy’ to you.

@_date: 2019-07-19 16:10:01
Correct! This is because the supply of Gold can increase if the price of Gold increases, like all other goods.
The supply of bitcoin cannot respond to increases / decreases in demand with increased / decreased supply, this is what makes it truly unique.
It’s a feature not a bug. 
I don’t think you’re really criticising Bitcoin. You’re showing that you don’t understand the laws of supply and demand and how Bitcoin doesn’t react the same way any other asset / commodity does.
Have a fabulous week!

@_date: 2017-12-14 13:41:00
I appreciate you’re trying to help but your points are none sense. I’ll just pick one point to show you.
You say deflation is bad...
But if that £100 in your bank today could buy you £1000 worth of goods in a year, that would be better for you economically. You could consume more.
But if you want to keep thinking that inflation is good, move to Venezuela. There’s loads there, you’ll love it!

Houses became a speculative asset around the time GDP became the measure for a country’s success.
Average house prices used to be 3-4 years salary. Not 30.
You seem to be ignoring those who can’t get loans.
I guess they don’t fit into your nice little explanation very well.
So tell me, as assets increase in price while currency loses its purchasing power... how does someone who can’t get a loan survive?
They’re stuck in debt servitude. While the landowners get richer and richer... sat doing nothing.
More proof that inflation is bad news 
@_date: 2017-12-31 20:09:19
I don’t agree with a lot of what you’re saying but I’ve got to go and get drunk so I won’t be able to write a decent reply. 
Your point 1 was definitely wrong, your counter argument is that there won’t be disputes. But there will. And this is how they’re settled.
Point 2, running a lightning node is one way to collect fees. Clue yourself up dude. 
Point 3, you’re wrong plain and simple. Read up on things before you say them.
Point 4, if you can’t understand supply and demand that’s your error not mine.
You agree people are bidding for limited block space... lightning network will make this less limited. Don’t you get that? 
Are you drunk already? Haha

I like the idea of my savings increasing in value but maybe that’s just me 
@_date: 2017-12-14 13:52:57
Your argument hinges on the importance of ‘CONSUME NOW OR ECONOMY DIES” 
Which is what a desperate government with terrible policies has taught you. It’s simply not true.
For arguments sake I’ll have a pop at it.
Let’s say we stop inflation. We instead get to 2% inflation. 
If like you say, lots of jobs are lost...
Well guess what.
When that money gets spent in future (it’ll be worth a lot more so it’ll be able to buy a lot more)
MORE jobs!! Don’t you get it?
You’re all about SPEND NOW TO SAVE ECONOMY
But what about in a year’s time? Who’s investing for then? 
Those with inflated currencies won’t have the purchasing power to invest in future. So they buy shiny cars now instead.
Those with deflated currencies will be wealthy in the future. 
And small inflation is a sign of an economy working how the government wants. Don’t confuse what the government wants with what’s good for you.

I guess it’s just really hard for the human brain to imagine things being any different than they are now.

Those who choose bitcoin choose intelligent innovation as opposed to opportunistic imitation.
Some altcoins are discreetly decentralised.
Others are owned / controlled by the untrustworthy.
Some will eventually have their supply increased.
Some already have too many coins in circulation. 
Some don’t actually have any purpose.
Bitcoin is the original crypto currency / store of value. All other coins either have to copy this idea (unoriginal) or to find their own niche. A lot of those niches don’t need filling yet. As such, these coins are speculative assets without value. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 13:30:49
You sound so butt hurt I feel sorry for you 
@_date: 2017-12-14 14:54:11
Judging by your other comments you must be doing alright with the 2% inflation...
Good luck bringing your girlfriend round to the idea of buttplugs anyway. I find whispering Keynesian quotes in her ear helps 
@_date: 2017-12-14 12:33:55
Hyperinflation will kill fiat.
Fiat currency is deliberately designed to be inflationary (read: to lose value). That’s why many central banks have inflation targets of around 2%. They want your money to lose value.
Bitcoin is deflationary by its nature. As more people realise the true value of bitcoin, more people scramble to swap their fiat for bitcoin and this keeps the price rising. 
At 2% inflation: 
-£100 in Fiat today will still be £100 in fiat in a year.
Yet, inflation reduces the purchasing power to £98.
-£100 worth of Bitcoin today (all else equal) will be worth at least £102 in a year. That’s assuming the demand for Bitcoin stops increasing. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 14:48:29
You’re fully aware that those in society in your position (wages rising above inflation and ability to purchase and profit from stock market) are an absolute minority.
We both agree that inflation is bad, just you argue that a very small amount isn’t because it’s okay for you.
Well news flash, there are other people in this world in less privileged positions. 2% inflation wipes them out.
Again, owning stocks is just like owning any assets, their price increases to match inflation.
Poor people don’t have assets. 
Have some empathy.

Why, what’s wrong with the virtual currencies that are already used in-game? 
If something isn’t broken, don’t fix it. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 13:28:54
The reason we stopped using gold backed currencies is because we couldn’t afford it. War is not affordable with sound money. Learn your history. 
No one needs to incentivise investment, investments are by themselves incentives. This idea you’ve got that stealing purchasing power from people is good for them is blatantly a contradiction. 
Having cash lose value is a stealth tax on the poor. It only makes the wealthy wealthier while the poor struggle to afford food or basic housing. 
The government wants inflation yes, but any citizen with half a brain realises its a system to benefit the few at the expense of the many. 
I don’t understand how you can honestly say any of the comments you’ve said here. Your logic is so backwards 
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:03:29
I can’t agree with someone who believes deliberately inflating a currency is a good thing. I’ve seen too many people become stuck in poverty to think it’s okay. It creates a class system.
Inflation is a stealth tax for the poor. So I see anyone who argues in favour of inflation as someone who wants other people to be stuck suffering unjustly and that I can’t allow. 
But thank you for mediating! 
Maybe now that someone objective has agreed with me, he’ll see sense! ;) 
Thanks dude. Wishing you a merry Hodl

With money, not debt. 
Before you can buy anything from an economy, you must yourself contribute work.
Crypto isn’t in a bubble. Although seeing as you’re only interested in speculation, I wouldn’t expect you to understand that.
Bitcoin is gold, not currency. If you tried to pay for something with gold, it would be expensive too. 
If you think bitcoin isn’t worth the value long term... short it :) 
@_date: 2017-12-15 04:41:04

That’s kinda like asking what’s wrong with creating a new dollar.
It takes a long time to convince a population that a currency is worthy of their trust. If they have one that works, they aren’t going to change unless there is a seriously good reason to.
Bitcoin has a limit on transactions per second not total transactions. Lightning will fix this.
There is no problem with copycats, but inversely there is no benefit. Unless there is! But copying something doesn’t make you as good or better.
If I invented a copycat of the iPhone but with one slightly better feature, is the whole world going to suddenly realise and stop buying from Apple?
No. Certainly not 
@_date: 2017-12-14 15:24:51
So first hand experience / knowledge is dumb and blindly believing something you read online is smart? 
You sound a little brainwashed.
“Believe what we teach you, but never dare to question it, that’s dumb”.
There are many barriers to entry that I don’t have with bitcoin.
I’m sure you’re convinced of the security that government regulations offer rather than seeing them as beneficial for the powerful few who control the regulations. 
Regulations are one barrier. High fees are another. Knowing that the stock market itself is prone to huge vulnerabilities bestowed upon it by a debt based fiat monetary system is another. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 14:28:26
You seem to think being poor means you don’t use money. That’s strange.
You also seem to think that loans are a great idea, and that everyone can get them. Again, strange.
I mean, the reason people need loans for houses is because house prices are so unaffordable. 
They’re unaffordable because there’s so much debt created by banks and governments.
Governments create this debt because the inflationary system relies on it.
This will only get worse. Already we have problems with homelessness (which you ignore when you say loans are available to everyone) and this will obviously get worse as houses continue to get even less affordable.
You’re dumb dude

Real facts are my thing, not ‘real stats’ which are often politically motivated.
You claim 50% of Americans own stocks...
Out of all of your friends and family what percent own stocks would you say?
If you went to a school in your area, what percentage of students would own stocks? Did you and your peers own stocks in school?
Let’s get a real life example instead of something you once read on the internet. 
I know that you personally can buy stocks with very little capital. Sadly not everyone is in your situation. I for example could not.
It’s like you see your own financial situation and are convinced everyone else is in your situation. Naive.

They may need to buy a house before they can afford to buy a house? Hmm that sounds risky. Default risk or what 
@_date: 2017-12-31 19:21:15
If what I’ve read is correct...
You would settle on chain to close a payment channel. You would do this if there was a dispute.
I believe you would also need to pay a fee to open a lightning channel in the first place. But once open, no fees until it is closed. It can be reopened again for free.
On-chain fees are a function of supply and demand. At the moment there is high demand for on-chain settlements (100% of settlements) but as soon as lightning becomes well adopted this will quickly reduce, and so will fees.
@_date: 2017-12-15 22:40:44
You assume that we need to swap bitcoin for cash, and that cash exists because of debt.
It doesn’t. People can earn bitcoin by working.
People can pay other people bitcoin because they have received it as payment for a service or a good.
Wealth is not debt. Well, it is in our society but that’s not how it’s meant to be

Our system is debt based. The government owns the largest debt of all. Inflation decreases the value of their debt. 
It’s in their interest (pun intended) to create inflation. It decreases their obligation to whoever they owe (if that’s you, they’re decreases the money they owe you. How annoying).
I do not rely on debt to survive. I rely on exactly the opposite, savings. 
Savings are decreased by inflation and increased by deflation.
Inflation and the debt based system is why I can’t buy a house.
Why would I want a Nobel prize? How many bitcoins is it worth? 
There is a reason major economists don’t invest in stock markets and couldn’t predict the great financial crises. But I’ll let you work it out! 
@_date: 2017-12-14 12:20:17
Bitcoin is scarce and fiat currency is not.
Good money drives out bad money.
So as soon as the move towards sound money begins, it will accelerate faster and faster until the hyperinflation of fiat kills it. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 13:37:15
You get a £100 loan today.
You repay £100 + interest in a year. (£10 interest we’ll say) 
£100 today = £110 paid in a year.
The £100 was created out of debt.
The interest you repay is also created out of debt.
So the overall debt has increased.
Do you understand? 
@_date: 2017-12-14 14:04:32
I don’t understand your logic.
Where does wealth come from?
When humans traded precious stones for food many years ago, was there a banker sat next to them facilitating the whole operation with a loan?
Yeah obviously not

@_date: 2019-03-15 08:15:44
You’re misunderstanding inflation.
When your house price increases by 30%, you don’t get 30% richer. That doesn’t make any sense.
Instead, your money lost a lot of purchasing power.
That house is still the same house. The price increase only means that the paper has become less valuable in relation to the house, so you need more of them to purchase the house. 
You can’t get richer without investing / creating.
So bitcoin will be a much better measure.
Instead of prices continuously increasing (making inter generational value comparisons difficult) 1 bitcoin will always be 1 bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-03-29 09:14:19
Think of Bitcoin as Gold.
Moving Gold between vaults every time you sell / buy something is burdensome. It’s also inefficient for small transactions. 
The Lightening network is kind of like a bar tab. You open the tab (open a payment channel on lightening) and buy a few rounds of beers. You may then, on a different day, buy some more beers. 
The Lightening network means that you don’t have to pay to broadcast all of these individual transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain. Instead you could just broadcast the total bill at the end of the month. This means you get charged less in fees and you also contribute less to the congestion of the network. 
Here’s an article explaining it much better:
@_date: 2019-03-29 12:36:12

What you’re saying isn’t valid, but I’d like to understand how you’ve arrived at that conclusion. 
@_date: 2019-03-29 07:59:16
This isn’t true at all.
As inflation increases your annual salary (in nominal terms not real terms) you’re likely to become a higher rate tax payer. This will make you give a proportionally larger part of your income as tax.
So inflation also makes you poorer.
@_date: 2019-03-29 12:40:11
The ‘average scenario’ doesn’t exist in reality.
The prices for production are so nuanced that there really isn’t an ‘average’ price that is statistically meaningful. Yes you could work out an average American price...  but I fail to see how this has any implication for the rest of the world. America isn’t even the most populous country for mining activity.
@_date: 2019-03-29 09:46:52

It always fascinates me how everyone sees Bitcoin differently, depending on what their personal agenda is.
This is the beauty of Bitcoin. Loads of different people with hugely different view points all work together to help Bitcoin (and by extension, they help themselves and each other). 
Apart from the internet, I can’t think of anything else that has united such a wide spectrum of society on such a grand scale.
The internet removed politics from our access and use of information.
Bitcoin has removed politics from our access and use of money.
It’s so exciting! 
@_date: 2019-02-01 12:44:25
Absolutely! It’s almost incomprehensibly good.
The problem with capitalism until now was that some people’s ‘greed’ was detrimental for both themselves and for society.
Artificially low interest rates have increased consumption in the short term at the expense of investment in the long term. 
Kind of like eating all of your nuts / seeds instead of planting some so you don’t starve next year. 
Bitcoin allows everyone’s self-interest to be expressed in a way that is positive for everyone involved. 
From starving Venezuelans to the richest men on Earth (and everyone in between!), Bitcoin allows individuals to protect themselves and their wealth from their Governments. 
If we’d tried to protest this government failure we could have been put in prison or silenced. It would have also been difficult to coordinate enough people to have any real impact. Until Bitcoin it was incredibly hard to free yourself from a tyrannical government. Not it’s much easier and getting easier by the day! 
And that’s only my perception. I can’t even imagine how many other incredibly compelling but entirely unrelated arguments for Bitcoin there are!

@_date: 2019-05-18 17:48:57
Well explained.
I’d merely add that governments unnaturally manipulating interest rates lower forces people to favour more consumption and less investment.
Low interest rates encourage high time preference (consuming capital now).
High interest rates encourage investment (invest capital now to accumulate more in future).
Sadly the current financial system is built upon ever growing debt and every decreasing interest rates. If interest rates were allowed to increase to their natural level, the massive missallocation of resources would unwind and correct violently.

I highly recommend becoming part of the club! 
I also highly recommend buying your bitcoin and not touching it / worrying about it for a long, long time.
Think of it as inheritance for your great grand kids. If you try to trade it, you will lose a lot of money! 
Best of luck

I like the idea of passing mine onto my children.
I think that’s a little different to mere financial speculation or spreading risk. 
There are loads more. The more I learn about Bitcoin the more I think it’s the single most efficient tool for aligning human incentives that mankind has ever known. 
There are lots of places on Earth where until now, cheap and naturally occurring forms of energy were going wasted, as there was no efficient method of converting this heat / wind / whatever energy to money. That’s good for the environment, good for Bitcoin, and good for jobs / prosperity in places where it was otherwise unfathomable.
And that’s just on Earth. 
Until Bitcoin, all of our methods for harnessing energy were all located on Earth. We didn’t have a way to transport value efficiently enough. This made harnessing solar energy difficult / uneconomical in places without efficient batteries. 
Imagine a solar farm, 100 miles across, 10,000 miles from Earth. Instead of charging huge batteries and struggling to bring them to and from Earth to the solar farm (which makes this uneconomical), the energy goes into mining Bitcoin. 
The Bitcoin hash rate could go exponential. The amount of energy going into securing the Bitcoin network would reach unimaginable magnitudes, all the while, the enterprising individual who decided to mine Bitcoin from space gets handsomely rewarded. 
I suppose that last one is a bit of a pipe dream at the moment, but I really do hope you see the amazing value proposition of Bitcoin. If nothing else, it solves the double spend problem without a third party, but if you merely reduce it to that, you’re totally missing everything else that is now a possibility. Everything that was impossible until we solved the trust problem.

Sounds like a very smart idea to me!
If you invest €100 in bitcoin, and you’re prepared to wait long enough, you could watch it grow to €100,000. Maybe more, who knows.
Or you could lose €100. 
That’s a very favourable risk:reward profile.
Welcome aboard!
