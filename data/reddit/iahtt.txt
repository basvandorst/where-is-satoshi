We need a mobile wallet with an option to automatically top up any BTC spent.  Anyone working on this?

I look at it more as an alternative.  You don't have to be 100% BTC or 100% fiat.  It's not a zero-sum game.

Even a friends and family round technically requires a securities law exemption. 
People just get around it because it’s rarely enforced and most startups die.

Practically speaking a startup is not going to issue to non-accredited under Reg D because of the disclosure requirements. 
“Companies must give non-accredited investors disclosure documents that are generally the same as those used in Regulation A or registered offerings, including financial statements, which in some cases may need to be certified or audited by an accountant.”
If you were running a company, why would you want to spend money on a PPM/audit instead of raising money from an AI instead?
Raising with 4a2 subjects you to blue sky laws, so it’s good early on for the founders and friends and family when everyone is in the same state.
The fact is if you’re running a (successful) startup, you’re not going to want non-accredited for the reasons above, so I do think it’s valid to say ordinary people miss out on better opportunities.

You’re wrong.
