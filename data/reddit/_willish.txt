You need to look at the image again. You need to be an 'accredited investor' to participate in the FileCoin ICO. 
What does 'accredited' mean?  
That you have a large income, that is all.
@_date: 2017-08-20 07:34:59
You need to be rich already in order to invest in FileCoin

There is a bit of a difference here.  
A) Teacher receives a paper supporting creationism without any evidence (because there isn't any). Student justifiably receives a 0.  
B) Teacher receives a paper supporting evolution, citing an overwhelming body of evidence to support the point of view.  Student does not receive a 0.

It is not like im a big fan of - (he still hasn't given my bitcointalk account back after 4 months of asking :P) but the evidentiary standard of journalism here is just depressing ...
Author neglects to read 'WHOISGUARD' in the images he posted as evidence.

Each missing character has 52 possibilities, from what I was told (a-zA-Z). With max 8 missing, this gives 52\^8  
There also 3 different suffix variants,  so (52\^8)\*3  or 2\^48

Mate, if there are not more than 10,000 BTC, I would give up right now. The up-front compute costs would far outweigh the unlockable funds.

How to stop the scam?
Start a new initiative called BitcoinGold, as a fork of their code (don't worry they haven't done much work)
However this community coin has no pre-mine, and no scammers to be made quickly rich.
Do some marketing, promote the d-day to start GPU mining etc.

He is missing about 48 bits of information, if what he remembers is 100% accurate after so many years.
BIP38 is slow. If we use 1000 powerful machines that can each do 100 tries/sec, we will still need over 50 years and a lot a lot of money up front.

I was told 6-7 missing characters, drawn randomly, from \[a-zA-Z\]. The OP's use of the word 'digit' is confusing and should have been avoided.  
But yes human memory is incredibly unreliable, so I don't know how sure we can be of these assumptions, nor whether the characters he "knows" are really 100%. I would question why he has such specific knowledge about the parts of a randomly generated password after such a long time.  
If what he states is true then we have a search space of about 2\^42, which might be doable. But this could quickly turn into "impossible" if these assumptions are not valid, and the OP actually does have a fallible memory, like the rest of us.  
Those attempting the challenge also have no guarantee that there are funds to be unlocked, beyond the word of someone on the internet.  
The OP also has zero reason to keep any of the information secret, since the details pertain to a wallet without funds, but it is not for me to publish it.

I was told that there were 4-8 "digits" missing.  However there are no numbers or special characters.   
There is also a possible suffix of 'h', 'H' or ''.  
We have a search space of 52\^8 \* 3.  
If we are doing 100 tries/sec per machine, and we have a farm of 1000 machines, this will still take over 50 years.   
(52\^8)\*3 / (100 \* 3600 \* 24 \* 365 \* 1000)   
There is also the fact that the OP's memory is not reliable and that we have to trust him that the same password is used for the wallet with funds in.  
Give it up mate :D

It may well be an impossible quest. An endeavour destined to be fruitless ... but I shall continue! 
I have faith that there exists, somewhere, in a shady corner of the internets, a five star shit-talker who can also draw funny pictures

If I give my private key to a program that is not open source, I have to trust the developer of that program not to have made a mistake or to have been malicious.
With open source, I, and millions of others can audit it.

It is not just mistakes also. It is very hard for a hacker to make a commit to a public git repository and inject malicious code.
For a closed source project with their own centralized build system, it is almost trivial

Bitcoin is bad! 
@_date: 2017-05-27 09:51:53
It is more than frowned upon lol. Its a deal breaker.
Yes it is hard to find vulnerabilities in code. By making it open source you increase the probability SIGNIFICANTLY that those bugs are found.

I made a similar mistake last week just allowing Electrum to decide the fee for me. Basically the fee is too low (80 satoshi / byte)
Mine did eventually go through (after a day or so)
Best bet is to use a fee estimation tool such as

We have been all been there and it is annoying!
This was written last year:


So first you probably should use a different Bitcoin wallet.
And it might be wise to enter the fee manually. You can use a service such as bitcoinfees.21.co to estimate the correct value.

Speaking of private keys .... :P ... I signed a message about 6 weeks ago to prove my account was stolen on Bitcointalk. I know you are super busy, but any chance you could take a look :D
Thank you Mr Theymos

"Just like high denomination notes were demonetized on November 8, 2016, the Government of India should “Demonetize Bitcoins” and force all existing holders of Bitcoins who are citizens of India  to declare their present holdings and convert them to legacy currencies within a certain time of say one week after which holding of Bitcoins should be declared as an offence."
