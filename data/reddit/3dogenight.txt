You just blew my mind...
@_date: 2018-01-09 03:31:14
I was scratching my head! WTF.  All know is HODL!
@_date: 2016-04-08 15:50:48
I never use my real name on the wish list for that reason.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:27:51
I think you’re right!
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:29:32
You couldn’t have spoken true’r words!

Couldn’t have said it better!
Bitrefill CEO, Sergej Kotliar, explained to news.bitcoin.com the motivation for this development by his team. “As we all know, blockchains currently don’t scale for consumer payments and currently require tradeoffs between decentralization and efficiency.  Lightning is a tool that can enable the best of both worlds – a great customer experience (both fast and cheap), but also trustless custody of funds. So we’re eager to enable it as a payment method and do what we can to support developments on that front.”

Nice Dune reference.

This is rediculous.  I hope this goes viral.
@_date: 2017-02-15 02:29:13
I am paranoid and want complete control.  I just want to make sure to never be compromised.

Can you explain the scenarios that led you to this way of multi sig?  Also, what do you mean dead man switch.  Thanks.

Great for them!  Great company!
@_date: 2017-03-03 23:49:42
Completely agree.  Also check out let's talk Bitcoin.

Their support is extremely slow.  I have been very disappointed.
@_date: 2016-06-20 14:19:07
Don't use Kraken.  Their support sucks.

The beauty of competition!

Coinbase customer service is absolutely terrible.  I NOW always direct new users away from Coinbase!
@_date: 2017-01-23 19:06:10
Usually Gemini.  Just started using them and have been great.

Who discovered antbleed?
@_date: 2017-04-28 01:00:59
What is asicboost?  Missed that one.
@_date: 2018-03-16 12:00:59
Great job!  All the hard work is paying off.
@_date: 2017-05-01 10:38:50
Please explain asicboost and antbleed.  What are the implications?
@_date: 2017-05-09 17:33:09
I love this one!! LMAO
@_date: 2017-05-01 12:40:16
Wow!  Thank you for the links.  All the drama makes sense.  Do you think the path to Segwit is now clear?  
I really hope so...
@_date: 2017-05-03 10:42:37
I still don't fully understand how asicboost works.  
@_date: 2017-05-14 00:57:30
They asked him to pay and put it on his expenses.
