Its about starting CryptoMall directories for businesses that accept crypto, like Bitcoin. We are creating a guide on how to do it. Anyone can start one in their own city.
Edit: Still working on how best to actually explain it to people.
@_date: 2014-07-14 16:04:45
It was a totally valid point. None of us can say what goes on behind the scenes, especially when talking financial.
@_date: 2014-07-14 16:07:09
Sites like this holding many wallets will be a fact of our transition from legacy to crypto financial services. Don't forget, though, how badly central planning has screwed our current system of money. The move toward crypto is based on a trend of people taking personal responsibility for themselves, and stepping away from the dangers of extreme centralization.

Lets say your local bank or credit union manages your grandma's bitcoin account.

Let the burying commence. 2 minutes 2 downvotes. Really need your help here and you could also help yourselves (and by help, of course I mean community discussion and awareness).
@_date: 2014-02-25 21:33:17
Thanks for the honest assessment. I think you might be right about the emotions, but we have to get back on the horse.

We need it as the gateway between fiat and crypto, all crypto, and to represent us all in regulatory matters. Bitcoin is sitting at what 10% inflation? They call it deflationary, but its going to take a while. By that time, perhaps it might be more attractive as a store of value.
@_date: 2014-07-07 15:10:38
Can you please explain in detail the mechanism that you set the guest house up with? Is it just a single wallet they are keeping safe? Any other educational material provided? Ongoing support?
@_date: 2014-03-05 19:35:48
It's fair in that your central bank can't inflate away your purchasing power to line the pockets of those at the top.
It's becoming more unfair in that we are not accepting the responsibility that comes with freedom and continue to place our capital in centralized single points of failure which are.. failing once again.

Comments seem to be poo-pooing the technology. Check out [Ethereum]( Imagine a blockchain with a turing complete programming language on top of it. Whatever you can imagine for organization can be captured and automated. Bitcoin is merely a market gateway to the crypto-currency scene. The innovation is happening. I'm not even invested in that but it's just an example.
@_date: 2014-07-16 01:29:47
We really should be assuming that all of these things that *can* happen *do* happen and operate accordingly.

There is no need to fight, as you will change to become something other than yourself, something aligned with the fight. Clear your head, think creatively, build a better way. They will take care of themselves.

The reporters are right, there is an ecosystem developing. However, Bitcoin isn't going away. It's an integral part of the ecosystem providing a highly liquid market gateway into it. Let's [regroup and focus](

Curious to know why you are even here? Peercoin and its descendants have already addressed that through Proof of Stake technology.
@_date: 2014-03-28 18:17:42


Not sure what that means. Exchange to a currency strengthens it by placing demand on it. Either way, if this was explained properly I am sure its too simplistic to counter the inflation/debt spiral.
@_date: 2014-02-11 19:50:26
Is anyone surprised that this comes right on the heels of two [scathing commentaries]( (CEO Saxo Bank) made by [central bankers]( (JP Morgan) against the safety of bitcoin? Are we finally seeing the iron fiat fist coming down?
@_date: 2014-06-27 16:48:37
**What problem does it solve?**  
  
That businesses have no local support to turn to if they want to accept crypto. They have to go online and talk to "internet people." Your local CryptoMall will have resources and consultants on board to tailor your adoption of crypto to your needs. This is in the spirit of self sufficiency and decentralization. Relying on local support networks.
@_date: 2014-07-17 19:54:52
The difference is that there is no mechanism in place to funnel new investment to pay off old investment. Isn't that kind of important to a Ponzi?
The whole reason for this garbage is to associate Bitcoin with something that will crash once the last investor "gets in."  
Totally ignoring the fact that once everyone "gets in," we just continue using it as money and drop the old way.

Please write a standalone app that creates invoices that a business can print off on their PC which includes QR code of business public address and amount billed to be scanned and approved by end user. Think of it as a simplified tool suite for small businesses... or has it been done?
@_date: 2014-07-30 16:47:17
Very interested in PoS applications where the business retains control of private keys. This would involve perhaps daily key cycling for basic implementations, printable invoices with QR code, real-time exchange rate for FIAT to Crypto conversion prior to invoicing customer. DogePoS is now open source, perhaps consider integrating features or adding to that project as well. @_date: 2014-06-27 18:23:47
I apologize for starting this, and fully support you. The level of patience you exhibit is a credit to Thank you.
@_date: 2014-03-27 16:20:07
I'm not too knowledgeable on the history, just wanted to highlight the pathetic and parasitic clutches of the old way. Interesting about coinage history.
@_date: 2014-03-01 00:20:17
This actually makes a lot of sense when put in context of the latest scandal regarding government infiltration of online communities. I believe that crypto-currencies are one of the hottest targets for manipulation out there. Notice how this is all happening amid fears that the stock markets could be looking at a major correction. Smear the competition! Queue the media frenzy! For context, see this paper I wrote yesterday: [Entrenched Interests, Lost Direction, and Stagnation in the Crypto-Currency Markets]( I saw that speculation after I wrote the paper and it blew my mind.
@_date: 2014-02-25 19:49:33
Thanks fud, I mean bud. Doge is leading the charge in this area by helping all kinds of businesses to accept digital currencies at their business. Before you know it there will be an ecosystem where you can spend your Doge directly on operating costs and will not have to exchange it back to the printed paper.
@_date: 2014-04-14 18:01:33
That went over well. I almost thought I was going to be exposed to anti-censorship propaganda.
@_date: 2014-07-30 21:00:42
They can. Converting FIAT to Crypto values can also be done manually. There are also other features like making a new wallet for each receipt of funds for privacy purposes. Connection to a fiat gateway if business prefers it. I'd like to see features to help the business *sell* their crypto back to customers if they want fiat. Whatever it takes to get businesses comfortable with using crypto, that's what we need.

Our normalcy bias has no effect on the timeline itself. That which cannot be sustained will not be sustained.
@_date: 2014-02-11 20:45:26
The nature of DDoS attacks prevents us from really knowing who is launching the attack. Same like how we don't really know who owned the 6000BTC that slammed the market yesterday, netting the owner probably less than 30% market value compared to if it was sold in hours instead of seconds....

What do you think low rates are doing? Allowing more people to buy more shit thereby raising the average price of everything. If you are invested in those things which the money is highly concentrating into (stock market) then you are gaining the more direct benefit as a rich investor.
On the same token a person with a massive debt wishes for hyperinflation to take it all away. People in the middle who are trying to get ahead are the ones getting the worst of it all. I guess that's mostly the middle class.
@_date: 2014-03-06 13:47:15
Excuse me but who do you think owns most of the assets that are being currently inflated by all of this new money. RIch people don't sit on cash. They sit on whatever the current bubble is.
Only poor folk have to worry because they have nothing at all except their paycheque, if they are lucky, which will not rise to match inflation. TRY AGAIN mate.
@_date: 2014-02-25 20:29:27
This is why I am posting it here, instead of in the local newspaper. I had assumed that everyone here has invested at least *time* towards understanding what Bitcoin represents.
@_date: 2014-06-27 14:53:29
Thank you very much!  
Coinmap.org may be more of what we call a CryptoMall (a directory of businesses accepting crypto). 
We are trying to learn and teach people how to start one of their own for their country, city, or neighborhood. Its about face-to-face on the ground consultancy to help businesses and communities to adopt cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.

Does the government or banks have any interest at all in allowing Americans to choose their own currency? I think we know the answer already. We have to move ahead anyhow and it will not take 5 years. The current USD crisis will provide the motivation.

IMO Trustless is a pragmatic use of the term. Compared to trusting humans as the third party, blockchain and all the tech in between IS trustless. What other term should we use? How do we convey quickly that we are not trusting *humans*.   
Edit: Proveable is certainly more accurate, but the idea isn't quite as well conveyed. Then again, trustless might give a false sense of confidence which could be counter-productive.

I don't think many people are aware but Russia/China could cause almost [instant destruction]( if they were so provoked or inclined.

Awesome! There are so many ways to go about this. The blockchain.info wallet seems like an easy way to get introduced to the concept, but it is a form of trust/centralization. We need to make it easier for businesses to become responsible for their own account. Props for spreading adoption!

Actually you were replying to a post about Bitcoins role in the crypto-currency ecosystem. Peercoin and all others are part of that ecosystem. Call it the "big picture" if you like. Shal we continue this "discussion" for a few more rounds?

Please tell me how a market driven solution will not become corrupted by people with boatloads of money? We need a system that promotes the right content, the content that we need, not just the content that is viable because of capital backing. It seems to me that a web of trust may be needed. How exactly I am not sure but we may have to fundamentally change [the way we use the internet]( (ie. wot layer on top). I have accumulated some other discussions on this reddit issue here: [Alternatives to Reddit and other social media platforms, voice of planet](

The rise and fall of crypto currencies could be like that of historic fiat, but in the speed of modern technology. To the point of the market share, I would think that whatever fulfills the needs of a crypto currency as bitcoin does, will take its share of demand as trust builds.
