VanillaCoin is another one:  
Lots of alts have innovated in the recent year. VNL, Monero, NXT and SDC are all promising alts that bring something to the table (I agree that 99% is shit though).
@_date: 2014-03-02 21:03:01
Awaiting the good results!
@_date: 2014-04-11 17:19:00
Maybe I'm wrong, tried to calculate the profit from it with a mining calculator, but its really miniscule like 0.1% or so for 2 weeks. Or did I do something wrong?

1) Well he writes "I hate" instead of "It's bad in general" so there is nothing wrong with it if its a personal blog style article (I dont know that website, first time i've seen it).
2) When mentioning illegal and bitcoin / virtual currency on the same page most people think about SilkRoad etc. (probably thats why he wrote it even if he doesn't directly mention it)
But thats just 1 generally accepted negative aspect of anonymity and there are 100's of positive to it. 
And then again SilkRoad and darkmarkets contributed heavily to todays price and function of Bitcoin imho.

Sad that you are someone who posts on and tries to lead a hate train on other cryptos. 
No clue how someone like you can even be part of an open source community with the amount of retardness you own.
@_date: 2014-03-04 14:13:10
Not just Bitcoins, but we all know how legit these bans are :D
@_date: 2014-03-16 14:26:01
Why should I explain it? Because im accused of having a fake account which obviously has a long history on my favorite subreddits? 
If your interested read up on it here: 
Also there was a lot of talk between differences on zerocoin and coinjoin / DRK, + the main dev is online every day to answer question and there is an infographic / whitepaper explaining the tech.
I'm not really the perfect person to explain it.
Edit: sorry im a bit frustrated cuz of reddit trolls.
@_date: 2014-05-15 11:44:01
Never had a problem with BTC-e. Do that if you can.
@_date: 2014-06-01 16:13:10
Can I join with a MOJITO? 
I know I know... gonna drink a beer after that.
@_date: 2014-03-16 13:15:43
Uhm, my comment history on several subreddits show that i'm actually living with this account? You didn't even check it before you state an idiotic thing. I'm invested in both BTC and DRK.
@_date: 2014-03-16 14:32:33
This thread is just full of trolls showing why is considered rude and unwelcoming.
You guys are just hurting the subreddit you all like.
@_date: 2014-06-12 07:40:33
I guess you wouldn't be here if the post said: got drunk on bitcoins.
@_date: 2014-03-16 13:52:09
Won't keep feeding you. Enjoy trolling.
@_date: 2014-03-16 12:02:16
Awesome read, also I really like DarkCoin's dev, hes the most active altcoin dev i've seen so far.
@_date: 2014-04-11 22:07:55
Tyvm for the information, also its a "lifetime" purchase and u pay no electricity for it.
Will think about it ^^
@_date: 2014-05-23 23:13:30
Except it's like coinjoin 2.0 with extended/bonus features and randomly decentralised with no need to trust the mixer.
Read about it first.
@_date: 2014-06-01 18:55:25
626, daytraders had too much beers....
@_date: 2014-04-11 16:39:13
Why is this good?
@_date: 2014-06-17 22:15:51
Nice art, like the style.
@_date: 2014-06-01 18:56:43
You got daytraders too drunk man, price is falling.
@_date: 2014-03-16 13:19:45
I did that once since this account was created since what? A year and a half ago?
Simply helping a the topic to get comments/upvotes since I find it a good thing (another crypto movement?)
This is a legit altcoin with a feature.
Obviously this is a fake account that also posts on subreddits like r/leagueoflegends.
Edit: very strange indeed, much fake.
Edit2: the other comments are most probably people from the DRK bitcointalk forum since there was a post asking us to check the reddit topics about the article.
IDK why I need to explain this your obviously trolling with not even checking my account history.
@_date: 2014-06-03 11:03:03
This subreddit becomming worse than 4chan. OP can't read or is not willing to. This is a decentralised coinjoin which =/= mixer. Think what you want, you will only make r/bitcoin worse with publicly hating on smthg.
@_date: 2014-05-15 08:14:15
I'm always late to the party :(
@_date: 2014-05-26 16:31:18
proof please.
@_date: 2014-03-04 14:12:30
Need a huge Bitcoin logo at the entrance of WalkingStreet. Make it happen.
@_date: 2014-04-13 11:59:52
Good read, hope both of the succeed.
@_date: 2014-01-04 17:30:08
What are the vendor fees if there are any? If yes, will it be enough to stop scamming?
@_date: 2014-04-04 15:11:09
Looking at your comment history,  you really need to get outside or find a hobby. ATM your only hobby is to scream "Bitcoin is dead".
@_date: 2015-05-17 09:50:10
I agree with the minimum amount, it should be around 1-2$'s, lower than that it may not raise interest.
(you can buy things like a coffe from that amount)
@_date: 2014-03-16 13:37:42
What is wrong with you man? 
All 3 reddit links were posted together at the same time by user matt on bitcointalk forums DRK subforum. 
People who are into DRK commented on all 3 topics to support the cause. 
You are an obvious troll, I have this account since aprox 1-2 years and im posting on forums like and you tell me this is a fake account that has anything to do with 2 other random accounts who are posting in different subreddits?
0/10 go trolling somewhere else.
@_date: 2014-03-16 17:22:42
Firstly zerocoin is far from existing atm secondly here is a basic explanation: 
And you can read more of it if you read most of the dev's explanations in the topic.
@_date: 2015-01-02 18:43:48
+1 for replacing Josh.
Everything on XPY smells like a ponzi. Also their lies on the 20$ floor were deleted from the HashTalk site.
@_date: 2014-03-16 14:46:13
You are the reason tons of people hate this subreddit. Just the avarage lifeless troll.
@_date: 2017-03-28 16:15:35
So why isn't this happening every day at around current time from monday to friday?
Unsure how you honestly believe this is real life use happening right there.
@_date: 2017-11-18 14:23:58
Reported for fraud/scam, I would also ask everyone to do the same.
@_date: 2017-04-08 16:28:27
That guy has 20 followers and joined twitter a month ago and he is your main source of information? Someone even asked him on what meeting he was and he didn't respond :D
@_date: 2018-03-06 15:32:19
They are the owners of some of the most visited websites in Russia including the VK social media platform.
@_date: 2017-10-20 07:51:48
Also look at the market manipulation that followed that bunch of lies. Noobs got dumped on hard by Roger &amp; Co:
@_date: 2017-10-02 15:35:39
the flippening is near, bcrash already at 0.09 lulz 
@_date: 2017-10-29 21:37:24
I'm on it, woohooo. Never knew about this list though, pretty sad how they can't cope with arguments, but make a list instead for mass downvotes, lol.
@_date: 2017-05-22 10:13:53
Stick to UASF. They are simply wasting time to keep asicboost working.
@_date: 2017-05-21 18:13:14
It deserves a post, because it helps keep people away from bad and malicious code.
@_date: 2017-05-21 18:16:05
r/btc is currently used to pump ETH, 3 ETH posts on its frontpage almost daily and also some top comments in irrelevant threads.
@_date: 2017-05-22 11:57:51
If there is no support for an SW UASF I would change the compromise to something like SW now and 2MB HF in 2 years because of how it bumps up hardware requirements.
I doubt that there will be no UASF though. The simple fact that r/bitcoin has 5-10x of readers as r/btc and that no one (no one who had an impact on users) had problems with core prior to this chinese miner revolt makes me confident.
@_date: 2017-05-22 10:42:01
Nothing but stalling. Go UASF.
@_date: 2015-10-13 20:03:53
You mean any coin using CryptoNote can do it, since Monero just forked Bytecoin?
Monero is the only one trying to sell it as their own technology.
@_date: 2015-02-18 11:08:43
Buy BTER and rename it to MintPal v5. Can't be worse r-right?
@_date: 2017-07-14 16:26:27
+1 Fuck trash people like Garzik who sell out the first trully p2p cash for USD gains
@_date: 2017-05-22 12:18:54
Go UASF. Lets do it in August.
