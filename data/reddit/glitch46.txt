I just invested a little bit with coin-banks. They seem legit so far; processed my CC and funds showed up immediately in account. I am trying their PAMM account (fully managed by their trading people) and will let you know how it goes and update as necessary.

I spoke to a guy named called Tony Ross and another named Sean Gilbert who claimed he had $4 million saved in Bitcoin. Okay dude, why are you doing this then?? Seems very scammy to me. I have a call scheduled with them on Sunday and am going to try and pull my money out. Will let you know how it goes!

Same here, they made me $250 supposedly. Kinda suspicious there is no information on them on the web, no Linkedin profiles of anyone I spoke to, and the Forgot Password link takes me to a separate site. That being said, they have been on top of their $hit and called me back immediately if I have any questions. It would be nice if I could hire a full fledged asset manager for crypto portfolio.

I'm in the same boat. I just disputed the charge on my credit card. No way in hell am I giving them all my personal info to withdraw my funds.  I've come to terms that I may never see my $1.5k again, but a small price to pay in terms of learning to be extra careful where to put my money now (esp in the extremely lucrative crypto market).  Hope you get your money back bud. I'll keep you updated if I make any progress on my end.

Yea definitely, I have requested to have my funds pulled today. Still have not heard a response, but think I can challenge on my credit card if worse comes to worse. They wanted me to deposit an additional $500 to open a PAMM account and said I wasn't interested. Did you have any success pulling your funds?

Tried pulling my funds yesterday, no response from either contact. Probably ain't gonna see that money ever again. I'll keep you updated.
