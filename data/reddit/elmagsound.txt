To all who are requesting/waiting on refund:  I cancelled my order  and requested my refund for 2 Neptune's on April 9, 2014.  I received a response, but in every follow up communication I keep getting offered a refund in BTC, which I absolutely will not accept and only want a cash refund, the same way I made the payment.  The answers are always the same, scripted and read by different employees the same exact, robotic way.  Talked to Lucy Edvardsson, Keith Gurnett, and it really doesn't matter who it is, the answer is the same:  we are experiencing delays, it will take a couple of weeks longer, backlogged, bank requests being processed too slow, etc.
So I actually contacted their bank in Sweden, Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken (phone +46 771 62 10 00), their account name is KnC Group, and their comment was that KnC has been having "money issues".  I called KnC with this information and after a short confused pause, the answer I got is that KnC is in the process of changing banks?!?
This is unbelievable and beyond any "appropriate" way to do business!  Many of you have posted on the forum with similar delays and no results, with status of refund being stuck on "Ready to process" for weeks on end.  So my question is:  has anyone ever received their cash refund, is this a bigger issue and do lawsuits have to solve it?  Tons of money is involved and this will not go down in silence.  I would be the first one to clear their name if I see my refund, but at this point, can anyone confirm resolution?
