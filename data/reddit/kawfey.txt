I said this to my friend, who I’m trying to persuade to buy. 
He bought in at $18k, and now he hates me.

Everyone sell so tomorrow morning I can finally have a $100 bitcoin.

I’m a younger ham who embraces technology and I think this is cool, but this isn’t that technologically fascinating. I had a few conversations with NVK, and I appreciate his work, but more or less it’s just putting in some text that corresponds to a bitcoin transaction into a program that converts it to an audio signal which is input to a transmitter and done in reverse at the receiver. I’ve been doing that for a few years with words and conversations instead of BTC transactions. It’s a good off-grid workaround but you still need the internet to deliver and update the blockchain to its users. To do so on HF would take years with BTC, and would probably require a purpose built cryptocurrency. 
I’m happy it’s giving ham radio some popularity in a much more youthful community, and I hope it draws more people into the hobby since the fundamental basis of using radio to communicate is intrinsically really cool and fun. The technology that NVK and other hams use to convert text into audio are incredibly state of the art, like WSJT. 
The only downsides with using ham radio is that encryption (i.e. obscuring the message) and using amateur spectrum commercially (i.e. with pecuniary) is disallowed and there’s a ton of debate (i.e. whining) about whether or not BTC incorporates both of those - I think not, but you’re right about the older curmudgeons who can’t stand this “invasion” on “their bands;” they’ll bitch and groan until they’re dead.

It's easy because a red screen pops up demanding money. I just don't backup like I should. Shame on me.

Entertainment, mainly. I have no bitcoin but watching people freak out is fun.

Use coinbase to buy and store small amounts with the included wallet, and larger amounts on a PC wallet. Multibit or Electrum

We're on the same boat, but I sort of went overboard on [my post.](
I think the best advice is to learn by doing. I should probably follow said advice. Start an account on [coinbase]( or download a [wallet]( backup/encrypt it, and get BTC from [Localbitcoins.com]( and then buy a gyft card which you should use on Amazon to purchase a thing.

Its very easy to find out by googling.

Its more profitable for low hashrate PC miners to mine scryptcoins. Dogecoin is pretty hot right now because its easy to mine a lot and the community is the most active of any scryptcoin. I've made the equivalent of a dollar in dogecoin in a few days rather than a few cents worth from BTC. Use CGMiner if you have an ATI card, and CUDAMiner if Nvidia.

Mine dogecoins. Much profit. 
(seriously, I'm not kidding. Low blocktimes, good efficiency, booming community.)

They make a new address for each victim. Here's a [source.]( [This one]( contains known addresses. Ctrl F for "Known Bitcoin Payment addresses for CryptoLocker"
Second edit: they've got millions, man. This is one of their primary addresses: 
Also, Funny tidbit: They politely reduced the fee from 2BTC down to 0.3BTC during the boom. [source](
I'm paranoid now that searching for it has infected me.

I learned about bitcoin in it's infancy when it was tied up with controversy in the Silk Road. I did some research into the protocol, discovered it's awesome merits, but had no money and didn't buy in. I did do a little mining on my gaming PC...made maybe a few tenths of a BTC from it, but it was a few dollars per BTC at the time. I stopped caring, and was mostly afraid that I would get caught with BTC and somehow be tied to illegal goods because of it, so I deleted my wallet. I was naive. 
I heard about it again when it hit the news Silk Road got taken down, then when it went $1000/BTC. I was floored. 
I still can't persuade myself to buy any. It's just too volatile for me. 
And here I am, mining Dogecoin. To the moon. Very.

It works as it's a faraday cage, but what it boils down to is that you're paying $80 for a metal box. You could make one for nothing.

It would only make sense to have a constellation of cubesats, since one is so easy to bring down. Plus, that does lend to great mining potential. The only problem is that when a particular satellite finds the right hash, it has to wait until it has line-of-sight to a ground station to broadcast it. I have a hunch this wouldn't be a big deal but I need to read up more on the protocol.

Think of phone apps as your wallet - it should never have more than $100 in it if you're me. The rest is either is in the bank (secure PC wallets) and my larger sums are offline on paper wallets. 
Never keep in a phone wallet more than you can afford to lose.

As a radio amateur, this interests me. Typically cubesats are communicated to/from via amateur radio, but due to the pecuniary interest I'm sure they'll need a different service, and that might be an issue if they want distributed ground stations - something that the amateur radio community provides to dozens of orbiting cubesats. Perhaps a regulatory loophole could be found. 
Even though, radio amateurs (and anybody in general) can acquire equipment to decode and distribute the blockchain data from the satellite transmission. Still, I think a cubesat would be iffy. They're quite susceptible to radio jamming. Even if they couldn't take command, anyone could jam it by transmitting on it's uplink frequency. An attacker with the skills and money to bring down the blockchain on Earth would certainly have the power to jam satellites. 
I feel that this is a "because we can" sort of thing. A satellite paid for by BTC? Who wouldn't want that?
