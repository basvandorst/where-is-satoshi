1 beer is 3$50? Geez.
@_date: 2015-06-17 16:29:03
Expensive, for most places I know around here. But I live in Europe's left buttcheek so I guess it's different.
@_date: 2015-06-17 17:17:41
Wow, thanks dude! Who said posting on reddit is a waste of time? ;)
@_date: 2015-06-18 07:33:54
Yeah I know I've been there. I remember thinking "Howcome these guys have a reputation for drunks? How can they afford it?" :D
@_date: 2016-01-20 19:08:56
With blackjack! And hookers!
@_date: 2015-07-16 12:54:05
Well then congratulations, you're the 1%
@_date: 2015-07-23 10:56:18
That's normally included in the contract.
@_date: 2015-07-14 11:16:47
They will. The measure will be approved with the votes of half of Syriza and most of the opposition which has always been pro-austerity. 
Then the government will collapse of course. But Tsipras will be glad it's over.

Democracy is not a lie, it's just expensive and you can't afford it.
@_date: 2015-07-16 12:38:15
When they ran out of cash. Do you know what a failed state looks like? It's not pretty.
@_date: 2015-07-17 09:43:54
So no VAT in buying/selling BTC, that's what this means right? What if I trade (buy) something with BTC, is VAT due?
@_date: 2015-07-01 18:40:07


Why should I trust Coinbase?
@_date: 2015-07-16 13:06:58
Then you can't afford it.
@_date: 2015-07-16 12:38:47
Or not at all, that's why this will be perpetual. As someone put it, it's fiscal waterboarding.
@_date: 2015-07-23 10:56:51
I bet helping others and seeing their gratitude in person is the real reward, right?
@_date: 2015-07-16 12:34:11
Nobody is naive here. They know damn well that the plan is crap, the measures they proposed won't work and won't be applied for the most part anyway. It's all just a shit show because bankruptcy and leaving the euro will bring about a humanitarian catastrophe which nobody wants to be blamed for.
@_date: 2015-04-27 09:56:03
How long does it take from input of data to having cash in your hand?
@_date: 2015-04-29 18:49:56
How do you get the bitcoins to pay them with? I'm guessing you buy them with US dollars. So why not pay them in dollars?
@_date: 2015-04-29 20:00:36
That answers it. Thanks!

Each time an attack like this occurs some people change their minds to support mass surveillance. Normal people. Yet no phenomenon exists that decrease the amount of supporters for it. 
So it seems is inevitable that at some point the surveillance will have a majority support.

I'm in a country who bailed out a bank and sunk its frail economy in the process. Here's my answer to your questions:




Yes, if you can get away with it.










Yes, if you can get away with it.








Yes, if you can get away with it.




When you can get away with it. Guess who can get away with it? Hint: they get to pass laws.

Don't you think merchants will quickly back out of bitcoin once the bubble bursts?
@_date: 2013-11-07 17:47:32
It is entirely logical if you start with the premise that it's a business.
@_date: 2013-11-18 18:07:26
So the benefit of wrongdoing directly correlates to the available processing power. Doesn't this suggest making limits on individual's access to processing power?
@_date: 2013-12-04 15:01:34
I bet the afghan would love that too, what with the other guy with the sign getting 23k just the other day I bet it would end up with a similar story.
@_date: 2013-12-04 16:28:40
Maybe. Or facebook, guys over there love that shit.
@_date: 2013-04-10 15:28:37
You're failing to realize the bitcoin is a bit like a unicorn to a lot of people.
@_date: 2013-05-20 17:09:51
But at some point the validity of this transaction is verified in order for bob to know he's got the cash with him. My question is whether it is possible for me to know I actually have the cash I think I do before actually signing the ledger.
@_date: 2013-10-28 15:44:03
Nice, keep it up :)
@_date: 2013-12-09 18:00:10
I'm sorry I'm not a natural English speaker, you got me there. Still, when you can pass laws you're pretty much entitled to anything you want.
@_date: 2013-10-28 21:17:38


Wouldn't dealing exclusively in BTC the same as refusing legal tender, then?
@_date: 2013-11-28 16:31:34
One of the effects of globalization and free trade is the leveling of the cost of labor and labor rights by the lowest common denominator. Globalization puts labor rights in a race to the bottom. This will still be true whether they're paid in bitcoins or their native currency. Unless I'm missing something...
@_date: 2013-05-20 14:50:45
From what I understood, you own bitcoins not just because you have a particular token stored somewhere but because you can mix that token with someone else's private key in order to create a new (their) token. If this is the case, how can I know that the token I have is still available for trading prior to the trade itself?
@_date: 2013-12-05 11:11:25
If they can still accept bitcoin for goods, and even if they have to cash it into RMB immediately, this still means that buyers get to skip exchange fees from $ to RMB. 
@_date: 2013-12-09 16:44:53
Wouldn't the people who bought those bank's financial products (investment funds etc.) be dead in the water if the banks failed?
@_date: 2013-12-04 13:43:14
Probably the same way you did :)
@_date: 2013-12-02 10:39:15


This is an interesting question. You can say this enables governments to manage their country's economy but then you'd be a filthy commie for saying that, right?
@_date: 2013-11-29 17:59:05
Because there's an excess of labor (some people say due to automation) and so laborers compete by accepting lower wages. The opposite happens when employers have to compete to employ labor, which is what used to happen a few decades ago.
@_date: 2013-10-28 13:35:34
Can you open a business in your country that doesn't trade in your country's legal tender? 
@_date: 2013-05-20 17:56:56


If I recognize myself there and I know I haven't given authorization for a transaction, can I do anything about it?
But I might skip something and be unaware of it so, my point stands: is there any way for me to know that the money is still in my wallet without actually attempting to buy something with it?
@_date: 2013-11-28 14:24:05


Is that a good thing now?
@_date: 2013-05-20 18:05:36
OK this answers it, thanks.
@_date: 2013-04-10 13:30:40
So will everyone else. So, how can it have use as currency if the trader that sells something for 1BTC/250$ one day sees that 1BTC worth only 0.28$ cents the next day? What incentive does he have to sell the same product but now for 900BTC when he has no idea how it will go? Is this a sustainable business?
@_date: 2013-11-18 18:44:58


Would that I could! I'm just putting myself in The Man's shoes :)
