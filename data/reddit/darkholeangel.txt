I don't think it offers any tax benefit different than other investments like stock - you still have to pay capital gains when you sell your BTC to USD. If you choose not to report your BTC capital gains to IRS, then that's simply tax fraud.

You don't buy from / sell to the exchange. The exchange is just a middle man who helps buyers and sellers trade at an agreed upon price.
Edit: Whenever someone sells a bitcoin, someone is buying it. And there may be trading fees that the exchange gets from that trade. Exchange can also have fees for withdrawing/depositing fiat or crypto to their system.

Also need to consider trading fees (if applicable).
Edit: And taxes if profit as the other guy said.

This math shouldn't be too difficult.
