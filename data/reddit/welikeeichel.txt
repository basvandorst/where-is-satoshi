why is this a thing
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:25:35
totally disagree - blockchain.info, CB, and mycelium are not good wallets. for the sake of being a new user i wont get into the details.
i highly recommend bread, samourai wallet or green address; these are much more secure. on top of that, the latter two support segwit.

if this isnt FP lets get it there!
@_date: 2017-12-09 03:38:16
i highly recommend that you do. bread has a very clean UX and allows you to customize fees. they accept most banks.

i mean he was terribly wrong about bitcoin but that shouldnt take away from the fact that he is a very smart person and an excellent professor. 
@_date: 2017-02-07 19:16:08
If anyone would like to know more about him he was my professor and the advisor to a club that I founded
@_date: 2017-02-24 16:26:42
probably the best professor I had in college, at least top 3.

@_date: 2017-10-04 14:30:42

samson and others have been commenting for a few hours now. 
@_date: 2015-09-01 15:05:52
I definitely missed something; why are they not exploring beyond 3.5 tps?
 
@_date: 2015-11-19 16:06:45

does anyone know how many people have subscribed to this subreddit in the last 6 weeks
@_date: 2017-05-10 16:48:33


I agree. I was just commenting on what the other poster said regarding his overall integrity. Though to lump you in as well. 
I take any of his opinions regarding btc with a grain of salt and not sure why he is continually cited. All I can think of is that as he used to work for the fed and is one of the more outspoken figures against bitcoin they found it convenient to use him as a "chief witness."
@_date: 2017-05-25 20:03:47
wow user rate has jumped thru the roof.
@_date: 2017-07-07 16:55:26
ah yes i remember when i tried to do this
happy to see ledgerx making big waves
@_date: 2017-05-10 14:24:07
hold on, i too approached our initial encounter with the sentiment "how could this idiot not see the benefit of btc/dlt?" but i think its a bit unfair to judge his academic and professional credibility based on, what was at the time, a speculative entity. in 2013 very few people were involved with bitcoin and any mainstream traction it held was due to headlines regarding price volatility. for people like you and me (im assuming you did back then as well) who followed crypto sources, attended conferences, and interacted with core developers we knew what we had on our hands. for outsiders, i think you have to cut them a break and in this case not call into question someones professional experience based on one stance. if we go with that then lets discredit robert shiller. 
im not advocating for his contributions, or lack thereof, but i find it a bit aggrandized to say what you are saying.  
@_date: 2017-05-09 15:59:01
I was his student 2 years ago, Spring 2015.
He's definitely apathetic to people mocking him. I think, based on when I talk to him about BTC crypto etc, he believes Bitcoin holds value - more than $10 (i think that was him exaggerating at the time) - but not to the moon. I mean for starters he was the advisor to the BTC club I founded at the university. I've said this here before, he's an extremely smart person. He's on of my favorite 3 professors in my time at the university.
