Usage drives up value but so does scarcity. HODLers are taking coins off the market.

Ok, so... I pointed out that the costs involved for a network of miners to launch a 51% attack are cost-prohibitive and that they're disincentived from doing this because it destroys their livelihood. They're better off using those funds to just mine the coins. Then you pointed out that the costs for a 51% attack are a drop in the bucket for a government, and when I suggested a government spending 1$ billion on a price crash isn't an effective use of their resources, you agreed.
So where is this 51% attack coming from then?


In the case of a shadow block 51% attack, the moment this happened people everywhere would switch to the Ou Rule and it would never work again. Price would recover as confidence recovered.
In the case of an attempted network takeover by a government... we don't really know what would happen because we haven't seen it yet. But most likely you'd see a contentious hard fork followed by a series of node upgrades that would move faster than a government agency could stop.

If the things you're describing were actually enough to kill Bitcoin, they would have already happened. Bitcoin would be dead. Governments don't want it to exist.

Watch it hit 16k early November. That would be funny.
@_date: 2019-10-28 20:04:06
We will never, ever have a situation where "everyone" hodls. Eventually the buy price will get high enough that someone will sell. Or maybe a bunch of people sell.
The whole point of "Hodling" is to try and combat volatility with a long-term hold strategy. That is perfectly fine. The entire bitcoin community isn't on some kind of schedule. For every hodler, bitcoin will reach a price where they then want to sell or use their coins. For some people that's 20k, or 50k, or 1 million (those people will be waiting a while...)

@_date: 2019-10-07 19:36:12


Nobody has it.


Not something you can do quietly.


Why would miners collude to destroy the price of the commodity that is their livelihood for one relatively small payout?
Look, anything is possible. But it's not like you've discovered some unforeseen vulnerability in the network here. People have been aware of and talking about the danger of a 51% attack for a long time. Realistically the only way this would happen is if a conglomerate of miners got together, and miners are dis-incentivized from allowing this to happen.
The amount of money, organization, and timing required for the attack you're describing would be monumental and would broadcast intentions fairly easily. This isn't something that's going to happen in secret.
@_date: 2019-10-30 20:02:31
Most bitcoin users are HODLers, not traders. The issue of leverage is far less important to the community than you're making it out to be.
This new cryptocurrency check box on the IRS Schedule 1 tax form, on the other hand... That's going to piss a LOT of people off. And if the IRS actually starts dropping the hammer on people for not checking that box, I suspect we'll start to see a rising push towards on-chain privacy features. It's already happening (slowly).
Once sufficient transaction privacy is implemented, I suspect the majority of Bitcoin holders will suddenly lose their coins in "a boating accident". After that, it will be almost impossible for the government to use blockchain analysis to track users and coins.
The more aggressive and hostile regulators become, the more nasty Bitcoin development will get. It'll be an ugly war, price will tank, but in the end Bitcoin will win and probably look more like Monero.
Trading on leverage, however, is a very minor concern in the larger scale of things.

You do understand that buying bitcoin is a transaction, right? That people all over the world have invested millions of dollars in mining? That hundreds of exchanges facilitate tens of thousands of customers every single day? That major financial institutions are beginning to invest in bitcoin as a hedge against inflation?
A lot less of that was happening 6 years ago. I'm not sure what it is you think "not using it" means other than buying and holding and not buying any more.

What are you talking about? 6 blocks is the general standard for a confirmed transaction. It doesn't matter how big the transaction is. Could be five dollars or five billion dollars. Six blocks in and the transaction is baked into the chain forever.
I think maybe you don't actually understand how this works.

Gotcha, I misread the chart. Thanks.
Yeah short of catastrophic inflation, I don't see how Bitcoin ever captures that much of the global money supply. But even the more "conservative" price predictions put it well into the hundreds of thousands by that point, which makes Bitcoin at 8k an unbelievable fire sale.
@_date: 2019-10-28 19:52:38


Current financial instruments have had a hundred years to build their market cap. Bitcoin has had 10. Be patient.


"No" selling? "No" buying? What's with the black and white thinking, dude. Nothing is that simple.


None of this is happening. You're concerned about something that literally is not happening. Volume is increasing, adoption is increasing, investment is increasing. Do you honestly think hodling is going to single-handedly destroy Bitcoin? You don't seem to understand how supply and demand work.
Scarcity increases, sell pressure decreases, buy price goes up, eventually it goes high enough that someone sells. The cycle continues.
@_date: 2019-10-29 16:24:59
I didn't say it was.
@_date: 2019-10-31 19:36:31
Well, 4 times. He called the bottom, called the time until the next cycle, and called the price two separate times after that. Haven't seen any other prediction that accurate so far.
There's no chance we're going to 16k today, that's ridiculous. But even if we hit 16k in November that's still close enough to his original prediction that I'd be impressed/surprised. It would also suggest that whatever "model" or "charts" he's used to get this far has broken down, so... 56k by July? Eh... who knows.
I'm not making buying/selling decisions off of this anyway so I don't ultimately care, other than the amusement of someone getting this lucky.
@_date: 2019-10-07 18:27:51
You do understand that this would still require than the rest of the network **combined** in order for this to work, right? And their stealth block still has to get 6 blocks ahead of the real blockchain before they can deploy it.
You're talking about billions invested in mining infrastructure **before** the attack can even be attempted.
@_date: 2019-10-07 19:55:18
Ok. So the government is going to invest $1 billion to build a mining farm to... what, crash the price of Bitcoin for a couple years?
@_date: 2019-10-25 18:44:28
Well how about that.
Honestly even if we bounce of 7,400 and hit 16k by early next month I'll still be super impressed by whatever sheer luck / autistic genius / magic powers caused Asuka to make this prediction in the first place.

This only works if the merchant is accepting transactions with less than 6 confirmed blocks. Anyone accepting a payment for $10 million in Bitcoin isn't going to settle for anything less than full confirmation before accepting payment.
So no, this wouldn't work.
@_date: 2019-10-07 17:44:27
I've read both of those articles. They're primarily about comparing the POW security of *other* blockchains *to* Bitcoin.
Key quotes from Nic's article:
*"This means that recipients of a Bitcoin transaction can have extremely high confidence that, once buried under a few blocks, a transaction is  unlikely to be reversed."*
*"While \[other blockchains\] look cosmetically similar to Bitcoin in many cases, none have the same settlement assurances."*
*"To sum up, outbidding the set of honest miners dutifully producing blocks on Bitcoin is very expensive."*
*"My guess is that six confirmations is massive overkill for Bitcoin, making Kraken’s lesser settlement demands of other chains more reasonable."*
*"This is actually my current view — that due to the current subsidy conjoined with the high unit value of Bitcoin, Bitcoin is probably spending “too much” on security. But it does wrap the protocol in a warm  blanket which gives it a good degree of protection as it enters its teenage years."*
The Ou Rule is a good recommendation for extremely high-value transactions, but odds you can still just wait for 6 and be fine.
But let's say you're right. Let's say someone actually pulls this off. It would crash the price of Bitcoin, people would realize they need to be waiting for more blocks for giant transactions, and then it would never, ever happen again.
Bitcoin's blockchain is astoundingly robust. If an attack like this is as profitable as you say, someone would have tried it already.
@_date: 2019-10-28 19:11:24
It will see widespread adoption slowly, over time, and probably the West will be last to take it up because the average American / Canadian / Brit etc. doesn't really need it. At least not yet.
We need a few more cycles of big bubbles "popping" and then setting higher lows for Bitcoin to start to seem more attractive to the average man. Keep in mind that pre-2017, barely anyone had heard of Bitcoin. Now lots of people have heard of it but it still just seems like a bad investment.
Imagine we're in 1989 and you're complaining that not enough people are using the internet, and it's going to die off if we don't get more people onboard soon. Patience.
Our grandchildren will have the option to get their paychecks in Bitcoin and buying sodas from lightning-enabled vending machines. We are still very, very early on.
@_date: 2019-10-09 16:23:58
Oh come on. Bitcoin goes through bubbles regularly. It's ok to call it what it is: a bubble.
The good news is, it still sets higher lows almost every year, so its baseline growth is steady.

No, because I like memes.
@_date: 2019-10-07 21:19:55


You do understand that the algorithm adjusts difficulty based on rate of solved blocks, right? When miners capitulate, difficulty drops, mining becomes profitable again, and they turn their miners back on. This happens constantly.


You're comparing banking transaction fees to Bitcoin transaction fees? *Really?* It's almost like you don't understand why people are using Bitcoin in the first place.
I'd rather pay small transaction fees for a decentralized network.
You really need to take some time to understand the technology better because you keep saying things like they're facts and you're missing major pieces of the puzzle.
@_date: 2019-10-01 17:41:44
I believe it predicts 1.5 million by 2028, not 15 million.
Even if Bitcoin captured just 10% of the global narrow money supply (money that is "liquid" or easily accessible) by 2028, that's still only a $3.6 trillion market cap. That's a fairly conservative estimate and still puts Bitcoin at $226,000 per coin (roughly 16 mil coins in circulation by 2028).
If Bitcoin continues to outperform every other asset for another 5-6 years, there will reach a point where large institutions realize its volatility is so massively outsized by its performance that they'd be insane to not buy in. Then Bitcoin's market cap could easily meet or exceed gold (currently $7 trillion I believe.)
A $7 trillion market cap by 2028 still puts Bitcoin at $428,000/BTC. That's still just 2.5% of current global wealth.
Will any of this happen? Who knows. Stock-To-Flow will continue to be accurate right up until it isn't. **Are these things possible? Yes.**
@_date: 2019-10-07 19:50:25
I assume you're referring to the fact that eventually the block reward will be 0 in the year 2140?
A hundred years from now, bitcoin mining rigs will be so powerful and so affordable that everyone who wants one will have it on their desktop. The block reward may eventually be gone, but fees will never go away.

Congratulations on your new wealth. Hopefully you didn't lose anyone important to get it, and if so, I'm sorry for your loss.
You've got a little bit of learning to do now. Understanding Bitcoin isn't complicated, but with the amount of wealth you now have, before you go liquidating the coins I would \*highly\* suggest understanding how Bitcoin works. You'll want to do this for 2 reasons:
1) So you know how to protect your asset
2) So you'll understand the true value of what you actually have.
Then you can go about liquidating your coins. Liquidation is fairly simple: set up an account on a crypto exchange like Kraken or Coinbase, sell the coin for your fiat currency of choice, and deposit the cash into your bank account. I highly recommend selling just a tiny little bit to get a feel for how the process works, and sell in progressively larger amounts as you get comfortable with the process. There are ways to do this to keeps fees to a bare minimum. Plenty of Youtube tutorials on this.
Be sure to document your transactions for tax purposes and file accordingly at tax time.
A few more pieces of advice:
**--GET A HARDWARE WALLET.** If you don't already have one. For the love of God, do not leave any sizeable chunk of your coins on an exchange or in a software wallet. You have too much to lose. There are a few good hardware wallets out there, you can't really go wrong with Ledger Nano S or Ledger Nano X.
**--Store your private keys / seed phrase in a safe place.** I mean it. Don't type them into your computer, and don't let any other human being set their eyeballs on your private keys. For all intents and purposes they ARE your bitcoin. If you lose those or have them stolen, your coins are gone.
**--Don't sell it all.** If I were you I probably wouldn't sell any more than the minimum I needed to pay off my debt and/or diversity my assets a little. Get debt free and set up a nice healthy emergency cash fund, pay off your home (or buy one!) set up a small retirement account, and then hold the rest. Maybe buy yourself something nice just for the hell of it, but don't go overboard.
Lastly, enjoy the peace of mind of having a fortune in money that isn't controlled by any government, bank, or central authority. No inflationary printing can devalue it, no regulating authority can stop you from sending or receiving it, no country can seize it, and nothing short of the internet itself shutting down can make it go away. You sir are living the dream.

@_date: 2019-12-03 21:00:48
Sure. It's like this:
Imagine you're Melania Trump. Barron is out in the yard playing and you're once again staring down a bottle of pills contemplating ending the nightmare existence that is your life. President Trump calls and demands to see some nudes because he has some "bigly dick energy" he needs to disperse, pronto. He threatens divorce if you don't deliver within five minutes and hangs up. You race to the bathroom and disrobe, fearing the financial exile and destitution that will surely follow if you do not satisfy Lord Cheeto immediately. As you start snapping shots of your plastic-injected body, you get a text from Ivanka telling you she just dropped a cool 15 mil on a solid gold vibrator and wants to get you one. Suddenly realizing you haven't sent the pics yet, you fire them off and hope it's enough to keep Mango Man busy while you inform your daughter that you do, in fact, want one and ask her to buy it immediately.
Ok so Barron is the unconfirmed transactions, Donald Trump is the blockchain, Melania is the PoW required to satisfy the nonce and I have completely forgotten where I was going with this

Down from where though? Even the stock-to-flow model predicts bitcoin's price being around 8,200 at this point. It's still above target even after today's dump.
@_date: 2019-09-24 19:37:32
It could keep going down. But then again, it could go up.
Honestly, in 5 years when Bitcoin is six figures, how much will you care that you bought the dip at 8,600 or 7,600 or 9,600?
@_date: 2019-09-30 23:14:59
There are a few things to understand.
Stores of value are held over a multi-year timeframe. Even now after a major rally and dump, there are still more days when buying bitcoin would have kept you in the green than in the red. Bitcoin's volatility is also *decreasing* as time goes on, and will continue to stabilize. Going from $10k to $8k in a few days might seem like insane volatility, but it's still far less a shift than going from $1 to $100 and then back to $20. Every year, the price shifts get less dramatic and less frequent. 
As market capitalization increases, the difficulty of market manipulation increases, and markets stabilize.
Arguing that stores of value like gold have no significant intrinsic value is also not quite accurate. Gold has some intrinsically valuable properties: rarity, limited supply, durability (doesn't rust or tarnish), chemically verifiable (trivial to detect fake gold). These qualities make it useful as money.
Now imagine that gold suddenly and magically had the ability to be transferred over fiberoptic cables. Its weight and size no longer prohibit ownership or transmittance.
Now imagine that gold suddenly and magically became ethereal to anyone except an individual with a special mark; anyone without the mark cannot lay their hands on the gold without the mark-holder's permission. There is no more expense of storing or protecting the gold itself-- no vaults, no guards, no armored cars.
Now imagine that each piece of gold suddenly developed a record of all the names of every person who has owned that piece of gold, and *every* piece of gold, in the world. Nobody can claim to have gold they do not have; nobody can claim they did not have the gold when they did. Centralized, trusted gold accounting becomes irrelevant.
**Remember we're still talking about gold, not crytocurrency.**
*What do you think all of these new magical properties would do to the value of gold?*
Bitcoin may or may not become a major currency. It certainly has the potential, and signs are still pointing to that eventual reality: increasing adoption, increasing awareness, increasing need in places like Venezuela or Zimbabwe.
But so long as the network continues to run, bitcoin will continue to be a major store of value the likes of which the world has never seen: magical gold.
@_date: 2019-09-30 22:26:33
Mock it if you will, but I don't know of any predictions that have been this accurate, this consistent, from that far out (over 8 months now from this prediction.)
**Prediction 1**: Dec 15 was the bottom, it won't drop further than that. (*CORRECT* so far, and doesn't seem likely we'll go below 6k anytime soon let alone 3k)
**Prediction 2**: Three month accumulation phase from end of January to April. (*CORRECT*)
**Prediction 3:** April price in 5,000s (*CORRECT*)
**Prediction 4:** July price in 9,000s (*CORRECT*)
Obviously this could be coincidence, and there's absolutely no guarantee that it will continue to be accurate, but you have to admit this is impressive.
@_date: 2019-09-19 23:58:09
God I hope that happens. I would love to be DCA'ing in at 3100 for a while
@_date: 2019-09-30 22:40:44
Uhm, it IS still impressive. Even if you just had a computer guessing randomly thousands of times a day every day, the number of variable permutations alone would be astronomical.
For example:
\- Bottom Price (anywhere between $1-$3000)
\- Duration until next spike (anywhere between 1-999 days)
\- Month of next spike (1 of 12)
\- Price at next spike (anywhere between current price and $999,999)
\- Price of Month X (1 of 12)
\- Price at Month X (anywhere between current price and $999,999)
Getting even a couple of those right would be impressive. But getting ALL of them right? You might as well buy a lottery ticket. If you only had a max of a few thousand guesses (let's just say there are 5,000 different price predictions in circulation right now, and I doubt there are that many) the odds of you getting it right drop to near zero.
I'm not arguing it can't be coincidence, or that this person is a time traveler or something. Nobody knows the future. But this is impressive so far, so he either knows things other people don't, or he's a pattern-finding genius of some kind.
@_date: 2019-09-30 23:32:45

Well, enjoy fretting over every single price move then.
You're never going to hit a "perfect return". You're never going to perfectly time the market to maximize gains with the money you spend. Every time you buy Bitcoin, there was a time you could have bought it cheaper. If that is going to undermine your ability to appreciate once-in-a-lifetime gains then there probably isn't anything I can say to convince you otherwise.
@_date: 2019-09-24 21:50:39
Well sure. It could also go to 1k. Nobody knows anything with certainty. Buying Bitcoin means accepting risk.
But between its past price performance, setting higher lows every year for 10 years, and the sort of price predictions the stock-to-flow model indicates... I think 100k in 5 years is not an unreasonable prediction.

Like most places, CashApp requires identity verification for you to withdraw the bitcoin you buy on their platform. Unfortunately their identity verification system is absolutely terrible. The ONLY way to verify is to use their app to photograph your driver's license or ID, but it's so buggy that 90% of the time it just won't accept your picture. Their customer service is basically non-existent. You can search Google for threads in various places where people have been trying to get their identity verified for MONTHS and nothing has changed.
The reason this matter is because if you don't have custody of your bitcoin wallet, you don't own your bitcoin. "Not your keys, not your coin." So long as you cannot easily get your bitcoin off the CashApp ecosystem, they have control over it, not you.

Youtube is an awesome resource if you know where to look.
There are a lot of bitcoin explainer videos, but this one is my favorite and is what finally got me to understand how the whole thing works: 
Andreas Antonopolous is a major evangelist for blockchain technology and digital currency. He's arguably the most consistent, trustworthy and empathic voice in the crypto community. 
Here's one of his recent talks: 
He did a fantastic interview with London Real, you can watch part of it here: 
His 'intro' videos are also a great way to get started understanding Bitcoin: 
I also highly recommend Crypto Daily if you need a little dose of humor with your weekly crypto news: 
Price goes up, price goes down. It's exciting when Bitcoin jumps, but once you realize how incredibly valuable this technology is, you'll get even MORE excited when we have dips like this because it means you're able to buy more with your money.
