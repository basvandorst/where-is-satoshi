Your inheritance is stuck in the legal system because the will (if there actually was one) was ambiguous and out of date, not because it wasn't expressed cryptographically. A digital will won't fix any of this, because it cannot be more descriptive than a traditional will document. If someone has an issue with the document or its interpretation (and there will ALWAYS be interpretation), it will get tied up in the legal system. A digital document might be more convenient, and safer/easier to retrieve and authenticate, but it's hardly panacea.
This kind of blind belief and faith in things digital, and that they are inherently better because they are digital, is exactly what the article is talking about.

Hmm, I have a feeling Buffett knows a bit more about "guaranteed profit" than @_date: 2014-04-05 21:02:39
That doesn't mean the intrinsic value of Bitcoin is $220. The theory was debunked, and is easy to debunk by anyone willing to go through a thought experiment, by pointing out that the market clearing price of an item is not related to the input costs. Items are only worth what someone is willing to pay for them, regardless of how much they cost to create. Very few things have intrinsic value, most things have a utility value. You can visit a garage sale, auction, junk yard, garbage dump or a flea market to see the fallacy of intrinsic value theory in action.

A bank 500 or 100 years ago was a very different beast from banks of today. Yes, in the future things will be different. Thank you for the insight.

Yes, the loss is less significant. If you buy something for $1k, then it soars to $1m, you don't cash out and it crashes back to $1k, you literally lose nothing. An early adopter would have bought those btc for chump change. Losing it all means making coffee at home instead of buying starbucks for a couple of months.

The liabilities far exceed their assets. Unless by "figure something out" you mean 10 cents on the dollar.
