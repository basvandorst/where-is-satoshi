why would anyone use Coinbase? They're anti Bitcoin.

ok, thanks. 
I'm not sure that I understand the power of your app then. Do you convert btc to your app tokens and give users a small rebate to incentivize the use?  And your KYC is tougher than the crypto to debit cards providers?

With Gavin not being a thought leader post Craig White, Coinbase has no on else left shilling for them within the dev community.  Why did they never use their so many VC millions to fund development is unclear.  But hey, Brian was poisonous to Bitcoin in the past 6 months (some would say longer), and the writing was on the wall. Can we call this a whinny-ragequit?

well said.  blockchain.info had the best start at customer base, but the VC money killed their innovative juices. blaming the tech/big-block is merely a sad joke.
