This is where the legal powers of law enforcement would come in handy.  You could subpoena BTC-e to figure out the IP addresses, contact information (emails etc..) of the individuals conducting the trades. You could require them to divulge details on the trades. I'm sure the other currencies tradeable on BTC-E have blockchains similar to bitcoin.

There are definitely other venues that might determine who the hackers were.  For example if it was an inside job, or if there was a physical security breach by organized crime (hidden cameras, etc...) or the hackers compromised the web servers prior to stealing the bitcoin (access logs from the servers).
And isn't one of the issues a lot of people have with bitcoin is that it isn't fully anonymous? Can't blockchain info be used to track the coins? This was one of the things that happened after blacksheep was hacked and people were tracking the stolen coins. 
However, they really can't do much other than track the coins. Especially since it is a drug dealing site.  However, with MtGox, the coins could be tracked.  Law enforcement could track the coins AND have alerting setup so that if they are ever transfered to a location where they can be cashed out (btc-e, coinbase, etc...) they could contact the organization with a subpoena / search warrant to determine the identities of the people involved, at which point they can threaten them to reveal other people by threatening them with "Pound me in the ass" prison.

Local Police obviously would not have a clue but with a crime of this scale ($500 million) I'm sure appropriate law enforcement bodies could be brought in (FBI).

except bitcoin already hit a low of $550 which your graph does not cover.
