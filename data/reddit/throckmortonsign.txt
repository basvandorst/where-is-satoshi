It's downright disrespectful to not give someone due credit. Satoshi certainly gave Adam Back a lot of credit. It was you who wrote "From all outward signs ... [Back] became interested during the massive price run-up at the end of 2013." I gave you example from 2011 that demonstrated conclusively you were wrong. 
Edit: Since he deleted his comments, here is an archive.is link:  Sorry I missed his last comment, it was something to the effect of calling me an astroturfer or something. Didn't really make a lot of sense.

Coincidently, I just finished his latest essay. It's very dense and well outside my areas of expertise. I think his avoidance of future evolutions of money, collectibles, etc is very deliberate. He's not wanting to "poison the well." He's inviting the reader to extend his ideas. For example, the comment reply from another poster on his latest essay relating burial tombs as possible family vaults is such an extension. The importance of unforgeable costliness can easily be applied to cryptocurrency, yet he doesn't address that low hanging fruit (perhaps in a future essay?).
I will correct you though. Satoshi did talk a little bit about what Bitcoin is and what it does and it dovetails nicely into Szabos current essay. I'll edit the quote in when I find it.

No I meant public key. One of the big confusions people have when learning about Bitcoin is that public addresses and public keys aren't the same. A public address is a public key's digest after being passed through a hash function. Hash functions are supposed to be one way. You can take a public key and figure out what the public address is, but you can't take a public address and figure out what the corresponding public key is. When you spend a transaction you provide the public key in the message as well as a signature proving you have access to the private key (or access to a message that was previously signed by that key). Also you can just tell people the public key and they can verify that it corresponds to that address by passing it through the hash function.

Just to add more context to this. Dooglus is a pretty earlier contributor to Bitcoin and used to have commit privs to the "Core" repo before it was "Core". He also ran a dice-like site that allowed people to back the house. He successfully wound it down and I don't think there were any loss of funds. He has a valid point. Imagine this set up:
* Cold wallet with 90% funds
* Hot wallet with 10% funds
So what would the procedure be to keep services going without interruption? You'd probably arrive at something like: IF the rate of withdrawals &gt; X% OR if total funds in hot wallet is &lt; Y THEN notify human to transfer from cold wallet.
The fact that there was a service interruption means something went unexpected. Edit: It doesn't necessarily mean the unexpected thing was bad, though. Could have been something innocent like it being the weekend or (M of the N staff) was gone that day. It is a little concerning though.

The date of Adam's discussion with Satoshi was in 2008. So exclusive of a club that I know of no other person that knew about Bitcoin before him (if you have any other referenced correspondance with satoshi from pre-2009 I'd be interested). The fact that his first public comments occurred in 2011 were well-informed opinion makes it highly unlikely that he wasn't at least paying attention from the beginning. 
@_date: 2016-08-23 22:12:20
Try this
* bitcoin-cli getnewaddress
* bitcoin-cli addwitnessaddress "[output from previous command]"
The output of that will be a testnet P2SH address. You can fund it like you normally would. Afterwards, you can use createrawtransaction and fundrawtransaction to another segwit address. Then using the txid you can look at it in a compatible block explorer.
@_date: 2016-08-18 15:15:19
There's something else going on. Cobra shouldn't have posted the key in that post, but they have information they can't divulge yet because they want the actor to not know what they know OR to think twice about what their doing. The fact that they are giving cagey answers and they haven't edited or removed the post indicates that.
This seems similar to the Steganography that Truecrypt used in their good bye letter.

I think Courtois meant public key and not private. That statement makes perfect sense in the context of bitcoin since transactions to addresses in the form p2pkh don't reveal the public key corresponding to that address. You have to spend from the address or sign a message to reveal the public key. Early coinbase transactions didn't pay to the hash though, so we know the public keys any way.
Edit. On second listen he may be talking about the need for a unique/secret k value for every ECDSA signature. It very much seems like they were talking past one another.

I actually think your complaint is a great example of how steep the learning curve gets in bitcoin. Do you remember how sure you were that the 32mb to 1mb softfork was a bad idea? Do you still have the emails and would you consider publishing them?

Just so you know, that Satoshi signature "7B536415" on Wlad's old key is probably not the real Satoshi "[5EC948A1]( but someone who was trying to legitimize their key.

From BIP16:




So taking that motivation, is there a way it can be performed with old "standard" transactions? If the answer is no, then there's your answer. P2SH transactions *offer* something that cannot be provided by previous standard transaction types. It's like coming up to somebody using a hammer to frame a house and asking why they aren't using a screwdriver instead since it's lighter.
The distilled debate comes down to whether there should be a discount on the signature data compared rest of the transaction data.

No, you can think of LN as a elegant use of smart contracts to set up a network of payment channels. The meaning of "sidechain" has been fairly diluted, but typically there's a mechanism where two ledgers can transfer tokens from one to the other in a set manner (2 way peg). Only in the very loosest definition of sidechain (to the point where it doesn't mean anything) would LN be considered a sidechain.
@_date: 2016-04-08 19:06:08
That makes almost no historical sense. LN was not created by blockstream and was presented by outside researchers after Blockstream was incorporated. Segwit existed as an idea before blockstream, and the idea of the segwit softfork was developed by luke-jr.
The discount is the area of controversy, and there's a number of ways to fix that  (if it truly needs to fixed) in the future.  See Matt Carollo suggestions...
IMHO, The discount controversy is bikeshedding. 
@_date: 2016-04-14 20:04:15


If you look at the leaked source code (written in PHP - /cheap shot), it writes the unconfirmed txid of transactions and uses that as the database primary id for the transactions. So the attack would go like this:
* Wait for withdrawal transaction, malleate it... wait for the malleated transcaction to get confirmed in a block.
* Complain to support that you haven't had your withdrawal confirmed. They check their bitcoind and query that txid. They confirm the transaction doesn't exist in the blockchain.
* They reissue a new withdrawal transaction.
You can actually see a variant of this attack that recently fooled people using the high-S/low-S malleability. So people really are that stupid.

I'll vouch for killerstorm. He is a long time poster and has contributed way more than most. [one of the papers he coauthored:  I don't always agree with him, but I always read his comments.
In regards to private blockchains, I really think they serve one purpose. There is various unsecure and outdated services in banking systems that desperately need to be updated (a lot of banking security depends on obscurity, badly implemented encryption, dedicated lines, etc.). "Private blockchains" are just a fancy obfuscation for the practical use of long-existing (like 80's-90's) cryptography. I personally believe that these updates never came because banks had pretty much no reason to implement them until recently or there was significant regulatory burden/capture.

Personally, I think we have a lot of people in academia that are OK with advancement of technology for technology's sake and not concerned for ramifications of those technologies. They sit outside Pandora's box and decide to open it because somebody is going to open it anyway, not realizing that box would remain closed just a little longer if it weren't for their contributions. I'm not Luddite, but I realize that bright minds can contribute amazing improvements to the world. They should focus on those and give at least some thought to what their latest technology can do to in the wrong hands.

it does. I call for a community-wide effort to develop more effective means

They'll have to softfork/hardfork segwit in or fork the LN code and make their own version which can handle the extra malleability complexity. Even if they implement their own malleability fix they'll have to fix the LN implementations to support it. Judging by Unlimited debacle (some of the same devs), this approach is going to be less than ideal. If the implement segwit, they will lose a lot of the already limited credibility they had.
@_date: 2016-04-14 13:52:42
I think this is a good illustration of how crappy malleable txids are. The "normalized" txid thing came up after the whole MtGox debacle when Karpeles was still blaming malleability for his losses.
I believe that Mark did have a malleability issues as well (it apparent in the code leaks that he was using txids in a database before they were confirmed... if those code leaks were real). Obviously this wouldn't have caused them to become insolvent without gross incompetence, but I do believe they had some people exploiting this at the time.
From what we know, segwit gets rid of third party malleability which will be useful from a code standpoint.

Should say that a backlog is required for decentralization. A centralized system could have no backlogs since they can charge any fee they want. **A backlog prevents a collapse to centralization** (a persistent inflation could also help prevent this, but I personally believe Satoshi made the mostly right choice with the coinbase subsidy schedule). Also nice to say that it's necessary, but not sufficient.

Flawed understanding. Your thinking in payment channels. You'd actually commit a number of bitcoins to opening channels with a number of nodes. These channels total value would be enough that you'd have Bitcoin available to spend at a number of locations over many days: say 10s or 100s of dollars worth. You go to the coffee shop and purchase coffee, but on the same day you go to the gas station and purchase some gas and a drink. You could potentially use funds from the same channel because each node you are connected to can potentially route funds to the gas station and the coffee shop. Does that make sense? You're thinking about a single payment channel, not a network of interconnected payment channels.

But remember they also get the increased fee income from others outbidding the bloat transactions, so although they don't have 100% of the hashrate they still recover x% + the overbid fees other users are paying.

Yes the goal will be it's that simple. They were using irc announcements (like Bitcoin originally did) for new nodes, but I think they've moved on to more advanced peer discovery now (I haven't had time to catch up on the latest). Suffice to say that stuff should be highly automated and only be worried about by power users and people trying to hack new functionality into the protocol. This is exciting stuff. Very much like early Bitcoin theres a flurry of exciting tech that could be based on this.

A blocksize increase will not change bad actors actions. Especially if miners are involved with the fee spamming transactions. They get a large part of the fees back (in reconsolidated utxos as part of the coinbase tx). A modest blocksize increase would only relieve fee congestion if miners (and the aforementioned exchanges) want fees reduced. They don't and people are willing to pay larger fees, so they will keep doing this. Second layer improvements and true scaling improvments (such as schnorr) are best efforts to help relieve this situation. Longterm, mining has to be redecentralized so collusion is not so easy.

That's like saying we can't use networking protocols because Novell and Cisco are centralized. It makes no sense. We care that Bitcoin is decentralized because it's valuable properties depend on it being that way, but lightning's valuable properties do not depend on decentralization because it assumes that the base layer (Bitcoin) is. Even so the design of the LN is still fairly decentralized much like the internet is (supposed to be).

Every LN implementation is based on using a segwit style malleability fix to work. It would require code changes for *any* other malleability fix to work with existing LN implementations. Segwit isn't strictly required for LN to operate, but since the assumption was made in early LN development it has become pretty ingrained in the codebases. For LN to work without a malleability fix at all would require existing implementations to be drastically changed.
Also, the known fixes of malleability that I know about are functionally equivalent to segwit, or based on a whack-a-mole approach that was abandoned as inferior (see Wuille's withdrawn BIP). Is there another approach that falls into a different category?

As another person that has a serious economic interest in Bitcoin, I think you are seriously misguided and need to talk to a few people that run outside your circle. Did you ask for any peer review on this BIP before presenting this? It has several blindingly obvious faults (one of which is the whole reason proof of work exists). Without a mechanism to get through that (issued smart property, proof-of-stake voting etc.) this BIP doesn't even need to be presented yet. I also think a number of people believe BIPs should only be used for consensus/forking code (one of the reasons that optin-RBF didn't have a BIP).

* Any program that is meant to be user-facing must have at least 100 lines of code written in Brainfuck. Please note that if you are writing "user-facing" code this means you must apply for additional licensure to write in Brainfuck as it's not included in the "primary" languages.

If there was any chance that he ever was going to make a public appearance, I'm sure these events (Dorian + Craig) have changed his mind. I wish gwern would stop the witchhunt... I'm 100% sure that if we ever find the real Satoshi we are going to be disappointed in either the person or the results.

That's my take on it. People are throwing venture capital into these startups expecting that if Bitcoin "takes off" their startup will take off as well. But for the volume and success of Bitcoin to make Bitpay a multibillion dollar company would also completely undermine their initial profit plan. So they are left pivoting and burning until they are out of niches. Personally, I wish Bitpay success as they provided a pivotal role in the history of Bitcoin (I remember some of the first posts on Reddit about the company - people were really excited).

Honestly Satoshi was not that explicit on many points, but I would say preventing regulatory capture would have been in his mind set (/end argument from authority). A lot of you weren't around when Coinbase was created (thus ruining another technical term), but I remember a significant concern about what would eventually happen. People then were pushing for privacy tech in Bitcoin a lot harder back then. Something that was and has been repeatedly put on the back burner with a lot of good excuses. I've been meaning to write a long post about this as I think it's really the crux of a lot of the current battle. 
Interestingly, the private data thing felt like a "won war" back in 2009. Feels much less likely to be the case now. Hard to believe that strong encryption is that effective when the hardware we all use is Swiss cheese when it comes to data security.

I agree on twitter being a poor medium for these things. Unfortunately it also is widely used and viewed, so almost every project has to have some presence there it seem.
From the whitepaper:

execution of a smart-contract can be the processing of inter-contract messages, creating
monetary transactions and changing the state of contracts persistent memory. The RVM
op-code level compatible with EVM, to allow Ethereum contracts to run flawlessly on RSK.
In the first release, the VM is executed by interpretation. For the next release, it is planned
to emulate EVM by dynamically retargeting EVM opcodes to a subset of Java-like
bytecode, and a security-hardened and memory restricted Java-like VM will become the
new VM (RVM2). This will bring RSK code execution to a performance close to native
You can kind of think of it as a backward compatible instruction set with a few additional opcodes. (Ethereum code should run on rootstock, but (future) rootstock code may not be guaranteed to run on ethereum).

Agreed they are. Which is true in almost every form of software, mechanical expertise, sports, and society in general. It "just works" always will come with the caveat that it could probably work better if you know what you're doing.

Well, what I quoted above doesn't have anything to do with Rootstock as a sidechain, but effectively it means that code written to run on ethereum will be easily ported with minimal or no changes (so claims the whitepaper).
Rootstock is envisioned as a side chain, but I think it's important to point out that "side chain" has a rather broad definition and the most effective implementation is in flux. Paul Sztorc recently published a long post on his site regarding a different way to implement a side chain. What Lerner is saying here is that he has a different scheme to achieve what has previously been presented. My guess would be that it is an iterative improvement on what Blockstream's whitepaper has already presented (but has not been implemented because the necessary opcodes do not yet exist in Bitcoin). Iron sharpens Iron and all that. (Edit: when he says hdr, I think he means headers, as in block-headers, stating that the less headers are needed than previously thought - likely with some Merkle tree trick. I could be wrong on that though.).
The neat cryptographic tricks that are needed to get a two-way peg  functioning in an applicable way can likely be improved upon, and I think everyone in the space is trying to figure out what the appropriate (and necessary) tradeoffs are. The eventual goal will be to abandon the federated model that's currently in place (in the elements alpha sidechain for example) and use something a bit more robust.

There's been at least one time which Bitcoin-core run on different architectures was at risk of being forked (IIRC difference in signature encoding/validation between different builds of OpenSSL). Luckily someone (Pieter?) caught it before a black hat found it.

You should know when to let Peter fight his own battle (or edit out the angry profanities at least, not helpful and just polarizes other readers more). Gavin does have a point that a too low blocksize is damaging as well (as was pointed out by the bath tub model presented at the first conferance).

I can understand the hesitancy of pinning hope on LN, but for SW as either a softfork or a hardfork advantages so far outweigh any disadvantages that it's unjustifiable not to change to SW. All criticisms ([best here]( that I have seen have centered around it not being a scaling solution or should be done in a hardforking way, not so much that it shouldn't be done. Also, SW is significantly more developed (it exists in Elements implemented in a way that would cause a hardfork and Pieter is actively coding the softfork segwit branch in Bitcoin as we discuss [last commit was 4 hours ago]:  Pieter is a fucking machine when it comes to writing code, too. I can't even think about supporting another side without a huge body of work coming out of another Bitcoin developer in support of that side (Gavin seems to be not willing to step up to the plate and Mike appears to have walked away).

The fact that the inflammatory BIP outrage post has significantly more discussion in it is a loss for the community (regretfully I couldn't help posting there, too). I don't always agree with but he at least brings some perspective. Unfortunately, I feel there is no way to deescalate this level of disagreement in the community. I also believe that both sides have rabble-rousers that have a strong interest in causing this to happen - they've carved a niche for themselves and don't want to be relieved of their leadership role.

That's what my ideal would be, too (SW then 2MB later - I'm being deliberately ambiguous on the time line - but reverse would be OK to me). IIRC the Bitfury data, I don't think 4x (4 MB) is likely to be a irreparably damaging to network, 8x might. I'm not trying to speak for the consensus at this time, just what my thinking is.
Hard forks should be extremely rarely done and only for very good reasons. My reason for the 2MB increase is not so much the increase as it would give an opportunity to learn more about hard fork mechanics and to teeter us on an edge that I think we could recover from (OH! We didn't think about [unknown unknown] consequence, we'll know better for next time). The not yet deployed versionbits developed out of the need to work out a way to deploy multiple soft forks simultaneously, and I think it's a great idea. It's because we now know a lot more on how to manage soft forks now that we gained that data through experience. Similarly we need to develop procedures for dealing with hard forks.
That said, I do think if we go overboard we will get into a situation where we can't get out of. Once centralized (in terms of nodes and mining), the ability to bust that centralization is extremely limited. It essentially requires a revolution in the form of a change in the POW algorithm (I can not think of any other way to "bust" it). Users need to be the economic majority in Bitcoin, rather than institutions for this very reason. Ideally mining would be more distributed than it currently is as well. The problem with relying on the nuclear revolution option is that revolutions always cause collateral damage. Additionally, in order to keep that option open, I believe that a median home computer with a median internet connection needs to be able to function as a node ("Burn the Satoshi defiler!!!").
I keep putting off writing a very long post where I present these ideas more holistically, I just haven't had the time to put it together.

You would never have a "crypto-contract" that says "unreasonable delay," you would have a contract that states exactly what time a unreasonable delay would be. If that could not be predetermined, or if the meaning of "unreasonable" requires a judgment call, there would be several ways to input that into the contract at the outset (For example, query sources X, Y, and Z. If the average confidence of X,Y,Z is greater than 60% that an unreasonable delay has occurred, then execute the stipulation of the contract).
Eliminating counterparties in systems makes things easier in some ways and harder in others, that's why I said I don't follow that all societal agreements can use cryptographic enforcement rather than a traditional legal system. It seems like very simple contracts will be the first to be used.
We actually already have examples of that. I could sign a contract with you saying that I'll reward you 2.47 bitcoins if you show me a SHA-1 hash collision. Or you could demonstrate it to  network and collect your reward from address 37k7toV1Nv4DfmQbmZ8KuZDQCYK9x5KpzP

You don't own bitcoin unless you "own" the private keys. It's the equivalent of owning a paper certificate that says "you own 1 bar of gold, please redeem here" and actually having the bar of gold. Exchanges can and have failed in many ways (especially Bitcoin exchanges). People get arrested, disappear, have security holes in their systems, etc. When you use a third party to store your bitcoins (or your fiat) you are putting trust in their hands.
If you want to get serious about Bitcoin, buy a small amount first, test the waters... learn how to use wallets (try a few out: Electum/Multibit/Mycelium) buy something from humblebundle or overstock, etc. If you screw up, you've learned a 10 dollar lesson, better to learn it now than later.

Somebody that's wanting to DOS bitcoin for whatever reason, or trying to scam exchanges or services that use incorrectly implemented software.


And there's the rub... it probably shouldn't have every been called a transaction id. Once a transaction is included in the blockchain, then you **can** use it as a unique identifier, but not until it's included (with some extra blocks built on top of it for good measure). The difficulty with fixing the malleability problem is that there are *multiple* sources of potential malleability in a transaction without invalidating the signature. The devs were working on it in a slow an methodical fashion to fix it, but when the DOS happened, it forced their hand to apply some bandaids and increase the priority of fixing the problem.

No one should buy significant amounts of bitcoins (and that definition varies depending on the person) without understanding cryptography. That will change in the future as we make the process of owning and transacting with bitcoins idiot-resistant. You need to know about the security of protecting your money. Repeat after me: I am the bank.

Just don't spend from the address you've sent Bitcoins to if you want to "really" store them cold... A bitcoin address is actually not the ECDSA public key... it's a hash of that key with some checksum stuff built in. You would have to crack the ECDSA algorithm as well as the be able to generate a collision with the hashing algorithm to take advantage in that case.
Google: "bitcoin paper wallets"
You can actually generate a valid bitcoin address with an offline computer that never touches the internet. You could even supply your own random entropy (dice rolls, etc.) if you know what you're doing.
Before using paper wallets, it's really important to learn about how to import and export them as well as learning about change addresses before you spend from them.

Yes, but even if side-chains didn't get implemented, the pressure to centralize mining would still be present. I'm not sure how much this idea would add to that pressure, but I don't think the idea should be abandoned because of it. After all, POW altcoins have that same equilibrium in play (despite their countermeasures and what their proponents may say).

Yeah... there's a lot of ways to take advantage of this. The site operator has a high likelihood of being the malicious one. The attacker would have to know about the client side exploit (whether that be a broken crypto implementation or whatever) and also have access to the server-side private keys as well.

Completely agree. Most of the commercial vendors are working hard to make sure their EHRs meet meaningful use, not improving security, privacy, or usability. Two of the meaningful use criteria are "Provide patients the ability to view online, download, and trasmit information within four business days of the information being available to the EP." and "Protect electronic health information created or maintained by the certified EHR technology through the implementation of *appropriate technical capabilities*" Any good pentester or IT professional knows whats going to happen with those requirements.
Now, when you actually read what they mean when say "appropriate technical capabilities" it almost all has to do with auditing who accessed the record and almost nothing to do with the actual implementation of the security. The problem with this approach is that I know for a fact I can write a python script that could easily iterate through employee id numbers using common "secure" passwords and hit a login pretty quickly. From there it's as simple as browsing medical records under an "assumed" identity. Two factor should be a minimum.
To quote Ben Horowitz:


The side-effect of meaningful use is going to be a less secure medical record, mark my words.

This guy, for those that don't know, is the originator of the quote (I'm paraphrasing I think) "On the blockchain, no one knows you're a fridge." He's well aware of the advantages of Bitcoin.
Bitcoin's big advantage is the decentralization and relatively trustless nature. It's useful for a lot of different financial transfers as it eliminates huge amounts of counterparty risk, but for day-to-day payments it's got a ways to go. I still use it to buy day-to-day things, if everyone did it wouldn't work all that well (in its present state). To me, I see Bitcoin as eventually growing into a "Open" real time gross settlement system and timestamping ledger. The day-to-day fast food payments are likely to be on a protocol layer above it (if and when Bitcoin becomes that big).

Do you have fun setting up straw men? Of course Bitcoin isn't as revolutionary as computers, but the analogy stands.


Because it's a practical system that can be used to align the selfish actions of the individual in such a way that it can benefit the collective. It allows for a decentralized consensus in the issuance and transaction of a unit of account in a way that was previously thought impossible. It's a new tool that we don't have a great understanding on how to use yet (though the people with technical expertise are beginning to see the implications).
I've seen your same anti-intellectual argument made so many times in so many fields of science and engineering that I just don't see how it can still fly.


There isn't a clear one, other than to speculate on the future value. But that won't always be the case... if not bitcoin a closely related successor.

We live in the wild west right now... exchanges are not well-regulated, which comes with pluses and minuses. In an ideal world, people would not fall for those types of manipulation and the "attacker" would eventually lose due to the friction of putting up those bid/ask walls. In the real world, it sets up a prisoner's dilemma (if nobody falls for it, we win. If a few fall for it, we all lose).

From the paper


is derived from an ephemeral public key kG generated using a random per-message secret
k, and a signature value s that depends on k. It is essential for the security of ECDSA that
signers use unpredictable and distinct values for k for every signature, since predictable or
repeated values allow an adversary to eciently compute the long-term private key from one
or two signature values, as explained in Section 2. In a widely known security failure, the
Sony PlayStation 3 video game console used a constant value for signatures generated using
their ECDSA code signing key, allowing hackers to compute the secret code signing key [15].
Other references: 
Every time an ECDSA signature takes place, you have to use a new random number to protect that signature from revealing the private key. Unfortunately, a lot of people don't know this kind of stuff. This is pretty much what caused the SecureRandom fiasco on Android wallets a few months ago. Some devs think that once they've figured out how to generate a valid signature, their work is done. A lot of Bitcoin users have fallen pray to this.

You're correct. I was just simplifying it. There are a lot of addresses that have exposed public keys, though. It would still be quite a pay off. All of Satoshi's early mined coins would be exposed, too, since the pubkeys were available from coinbase transactions originally.

I've used and use all three. They all have their advantages and disadvantages. For cold storage and offline signing capability, Armory is the winner, but it requires bitcoin core (and a fully downloaded blockchain) to run. Electrum is nice and boots up quickly and is fairly easy to use. Multibit seems to have the best UI for a beginner, but it uses a non-deterministic wallet structure.
Begin Rant:
All clients have bugs. If you are depending on a client's behavior to secure your 1000 BTC, you're in for a rude awakening (or have increased your risk of a rude awakening, I guess not all drunk drivers get caught).
My suggestion for everyone with a lot of bitcoins is stop putting all your eggs in one basket. Develop a tiered approach in how you secure your bitcoins (0-20% in a hot wallet, 80% in cold wallets, or something similar). When moving large amounts of bitcoin, look at the transaction itself before broadcasting it (make sure the change address is an address you know you have control over, with a deterministic wallet this is very easy to figure out).
\*deep breath*
When you own large amount of coins, you've turned Bitcoin into more than a hobby. You're no longer a private pilot, you're a jet airliner pilot. You need to know what all switches and doo-dads of the Bitcoin protocol are.

That's a good question. If you are making a profit with doge/lite then why would move to bitcoin? Because they probably won't always be as profitable to mine. The proof of work is like a feed-back loop, much like in physiology. If it becomes more profitable, people join, it becomes less profitable, people leave... the "set-point" is probably just profitable enough to make it worthwhile.
So Bitcoin's harder to mine efficiently right now, less people are joining, but the people that go through the time to figure out what hardware is actually profitable and do the research can still find a niche.
That's my take on it. Scrypt has the advantage that it's harder to produce ASICs for, but in the end it's the same race... with a lot of the same feed-back loops in play.

Protocols will never be perfect... they just have to be better than what's available. Fungibility can't be "built-in" as long as there is a reasonably good way to track transactions. Otherwise, we are just trusting people not to make those associations. Any time where the solution is "I'll just trust them not to do this" it should be followed with "until I can think of way that it can be done without trust."

If this is implemented, I think we may have a new criteria for altcoin scams:

If the answer is yes to any of these, then it's a scam.

Using truecrypt may be a good option for you as a backup. I would caution you on just using a usb drive for backup of wallet.dat, 3 backups one offsite is the general mantra. It's about tradeoffs. Remember keyloggers are the thing to be worried about with long passphrases, so "double" encrypting probably doesn't offer much protection. The only way to be sure your coins are safe is to use a airgapped offline computer or paper wallet, but many people see that as overkill. Hardware wallets should be the eventual solution, but we are still waiting on the first gen devices. If you are serious about protecting your coins and are ok with downloading the entire blockchain, it may be worth looking into armory and how to perform offline transactions.

While I'd agree regarding asymmetric ciphers there are a few symmetric ciphers that are provably secure within a computational bound (and others like OTP, which require keys the size of the plaintext). The rate at which symmetric ciphers have been broken is getting slower and slower to the point where it's probably safe to store not top secret stuff online (provided your key management is adequate).

Chaumian e-cash is a completely different beast that Satoshi's contribution.
Chaum even states in his seminal paper:


Alice as a multiple spender.
Digicash was centralized and it failed for that very reason.
If you really look at what Satoshi contributed, you'll see he brought elements of RPOW, hashcash, and b-money in addition to his contribution of using a "block chain" to provide for a probabilistic solution to a problem that was proven to be impossible to solve deterministically.
The closest work that I can find that almost achieved what bitcoin does is Nick Szabo's work on bit-gold. But don't take my word on it: 
I didn't realize this, but I actually think Szabo actually picked on a similar feature of Bitcoin that I believe, too:


I really think that Satoshi deliberately designed the coin distribution to appeal to those that might not understand the mechanics of bitcoin, but liked the idea of a limited, deflating system. He co-opted people into using it by appealing to their greed, which I feel is really the big reason for Bitcoins initial success. Whether that becomes a fatal flaw, it's really of no matter, because he proved that his consensus system works and can be used on later systems. I actually feel Bitcoin is good enough to remain the dominant system for quite a while and the economic framework is secondary to it's proven utility as a decentralized consensus tool.

Your stretching my limits aren't you? ;)
I'm going to butcher this explanation because I haven't done real computer programming in a long time (I'm a medical doctor), but padding is way to standardize data...
So if 111 in binary is equal 7 in decimal... but you want store that in a 4 bit variable then you "pad" it with an extra zero "0111"
111 and 0111 are perfectly valid representations of 7.
See: 
Now how this applies to malleability and the like, you have to have a really good understanding of crypto, and I don't have enough to explain it well.
Edit: here's the BIP that might explains where the sources of malleability are: 
Looking into this further: "scriptPubKey opcodes use inputs that are interpreted as numbers" - so if those opcodes don't have a strict padding specification, then they can be used as a source of malleability.

Some interesting things about the auditing process, which I'm sure you're thinking about. It actually starts to blur the lines between a security and a financial audit.
For example, saying you own an address and owning an address are two different things - proving ownership is an important part of the auditing process. Not only that, proving that you are the only owner of the private keys and those keys are sufficiently well protected is important as well. Additionally, "Internal" systems of coin taint could be assigned which could help protect against some funny business (e.g. using bitcoins and then "returning" them at a later time.).

Well as long as there is one honest node that is able to connect to the network at large then there shouldn't be any problem and transactions should relay quickly. The problem is that when you segregate the network enough, if you can surround that "network" with dishonest nodes you could block the relay of transactions (See Sybil attack:  that's very unlikely to happen in a robust network because all it takes is one honest node to defeat it, but in a locked down situation, it might be possible. That's why it's important to listen to the cubesat... provided you trust the cubesat operator.

I wouldn't call it meaningless, just that the information cannot be used to justify his conclusions. Tim Swanson, who's done a lot of thinking on the subject draws the same conclusions. I don't agree with it though. In my opinion, the cost of keeping a distributed POW network going is justified by the future needs it can fulfill. We need censorship resistance, we need an alternative grey-market, and we need a tool to help punish governments for their over-reaching policies. If Bitcoin can help do that (like the Internet has already done), then it justifies the costs of the infrastructure. The transaction network layer is just an extra boon, but there's other more valuable things that can be built into it.
Then the question becomes, well if non-monetary assets can be tracked using Bitcoin, is the block subsidy too low to support the network? Seem like you can't have it both ways to me... is it too high or too low for the network? My guess is the number of variables being measured makes it difficult or impossible to figure out with a high degree of reliability. The most rational approach is to let the market figure that out.
People want to get rich, well sorry you should have bought coins at $0-$30... at this price point you're going to have to wait until the real work is done and you're going to have to hope that the Bitcoin "advantages" aren't caught in an endless regulatory quagmire. It could be years before that happens, and it might not happen at all. I'm still betting that Bitcoin will become successful, but not on a strict timeline.
Considering Satoshi chose block reward halving at every 4 years tells me that Bitcoin is advancing at just about the right pace. Personally I would have liked to see a smoothed reward (slight adjustment of coins with difficult adjustment or the like) since I think it would be less jarring (many weren't around for the last halving, but there was a lot of sky-is-falling posts).

This needs to happen sooner or later. I think part of it is we are seeing the major companies (Coinbase and Bitpay) doing the majority of their business with crypto-to-fiat conversion. They are taking the headache and ugliness out of a handling Bitcoin, so much so that many companies see Bitcoin as just another payment processor. The actual holders of wallets, the end users, are the ones that have to deal with the ugliness of Bitcoin, and for the most part many are unwilling or unable to contribute to the formation of a good "Red Hat" of Bitcoin. Personally, I think Bitpay is the closest thing we have to a Red Hat, though I do hope somebody comes along and takes those responsibilities (It probably has something to do with you being there, but I don't know).
Regarding Bitcoin devs listening to the users and integrating changes as demanded by the user community, that can be a little scary. I want there to be a soundness in the design of the protocol and I think a lot of those intricacies are lost on the majority of the users. I much prefer meritocracy when it comes to core development.

It's important to state what "random" means... people think they can generate random phrases, when actually they are very bad at it. I would suggest using a wordlist and a good source or randomness to pick your words.
An example would be 5 computer or dice-chosen words from this wordlist: 
This would give 55 bits of entropy assuming the attacker knew the wordlist and that you used 5 random words from it.

Well, I like the idea of that, but I think it's years away and requires a level of knowledge from the general population that's just not there yet. We can dream though. A data repository like the original StorJ concept with multiparty encryption and the ability to revoke access would be really nice, but I don't see that being applicable to medical databases for many years.
@_date: 2014-05-12 22:59:04
An important part about the Trezor is that it's deterministic. You can test it and receive the results *exactly* how they are expected to be. That doesn't make it impossible to install a backdoor, but it makes it a lot harder and significantly limits its usefulness. It also makes it a requirement that all the pieces of hardware you are using are somehow affected.
There's a few limitation I can think of, backdoors installed at the foundry-level for the MCU, and exploiting a side channel with the USB interface.
It's possible, but the quality and design of the product is almost as good as you can get to prevent that type of exploitation.

Completely agree with this sentiment. I don't encourage people to get into Bitcoin unless I think they are up for the risks. Which has been a grand total of one person.
To me we are experiencing the symptoms of growing too fast. We have hundreds of new subscribers here a day... how many of them do you think actually understand the concepts of public-key crypto? Until we can improve the ergonomics of being able to use bitcoin, I won't recommend it. It's kind of chicken or an egg thing. We are getting there, though. I actually think Bitcoin is giving the appropriate incentives to secure the internet that should have happened 10-15 years ago. There's a better life through cryptography, it's just there's a trial by fire to get there.
People need to realize a device like the Trezor (when it eventually comes out) is going to be exceedingly helpful. We are seeing advancements in secure-multiparty computation and trusted computing simply because it's necessary now to secure people's money. These are the things that should be called for, not bailouts and further rent seeking when things go bad.

I'm not a member of the AMA (most docs in the US aren't) and I'm not a millionaire (though I may be in a few years). We absolutely do not have enough money to change it. The insurance companies, device manufacturers, drug companies, and hospital lobbies dwarf anything we could ever do. The only way to fight the system is not to participate, accept cash payments only and basically "opt out." The only problem with that is that every year regulations make it more and more difficult to practice privately and make enough to pay overhead, which increases every single year. Most doctors are not part of the problem. There are a few bad actors, and they get a lot of attention, but the Family docs, IM, Psych, ID, and other "cognitive" fields get endlessly raped by the CMS price-fixing schemes and lobbies.
The AMA has very little to do with limiting medical school admissions and graduates. And that's not even the real bottleneck, that's the number of residency spots available (you have to have at least a year of residency to practice medicine in the US). The spots are funded by the government.

Peter, I didn't know that about the Tor network, so thanks for the education. Regarding passport issuance, I do think it's odd that Mike didn't make that explicitly clear (at least in the video where he explains the concept). It doesn't take a lot of brain cells to figure out that shortcoming, though (if an individual can follow the discussion up to that point, it should be pretty easy for that individual to make that same conclusion). Overall, the idea is interesting to me, but very objectionable for those reasons. I don't think the pitchforks should be used to drive Mike out of Bitcoin development because of those suggestions. Same for his blacklisting proposals... they may be misguided, but those discussions need to happen.

Oh, I certainly don't think he did it for diabolical reasons. In fact, in this situation "greed is good." It allowed him to get enough hashrate together to prove his system worked and was resistant to double-spends.

You can take a transaction in any media (paper, radiowave, morse code, QR code, file, etc.) and as long as you can present it to a node on the network and the transaction is valid, it will be relayed. The question is how do you verify that transaction was relayed and included in a block? There are several different ways, but for smaller devices, relying on a SPV system is good enough. I won't bore you with the details, but a SPV system can figure out if a payment is in the blockchain a lot faster (with less bandwidth) than downloading the entirety of the blockchain.

Just a little quibble, I'm pretty sure bitcointip worked on chain. It would create addresses per username and each tip would result in a new transaction. Hence the miner fees per tip. I actually prefer the off-chain functionality of changetip, but I think the address flair would be great parallel solution (for the more hardcore types). Before the bitcointip bot, people would occasionally post addresses in the message body for tips, so it was nice that the bitcointip bot came and cleared that up. Changetip is a nice incremental improvement. 
If stealth addresses weren't so long, I think they would be ideal to be used as (expandable) flair.

It's interesting that Bitcoin provided the incentive to create such a device, but this thing has far reaching uses if it can catch on (over and above a yubikey). Here's hoping they become common. I think this is a integral part to making a usable decentralized platforms. I'd also be interested in a Trezor like device with some Web-of-trust (or PKI) features built in (I haven't thought too much about how this would be implemented). This could allow for some very interesting things to develop.

I think there's a couple of devs that are skeptical on the sustainability of Bitcoin. Not in the way that they think it will fail, just that it *might* fail.
I love how Gavin is almost never brought into the "Bitcoin to the Moon!!!" hysteria that many others will. His "I don't know." answer to where Bitcoin will be in 10 years is the perfect answer. It *may* replace wire transfers, it *may* replace remittance systems, it may do a lot of things, but there's a non-zero possibility it won't do any of those things (how big that non-zero possibility is up for debate). Gavin is a contemplative guy, and that makes him a valuable resource to the community.
I think it's pretty cool the amount of depth and breadth that individual devs bring to Bitcoin. From Amir Taaki to Peter Todd to Mike Hearn (and others), there's a huge difference of opinion on what Bitcoin "should be." There are some very interesting dichotomies of belief.

That's a good question to ask Coinbase. It's important to realize coins that it's really hard to **prove** that coins from a source were ill-gotten.

Government agencies may request records without patient consent to verify claims made through Medicare, Medicaid and other government programs. They may also share this data with third party contractors, but I'm unclear if it's been anonymized at that point. Insurance companies don't have permission to do this, except most will only issue you a policy if you allow that disclosure. I don't know how much ACA has changed those rules if at all, but as far as I know they are still valid. In addition, tailored information about patients are stored and shared by MIB, inc. among its members.
As far as implementation of EHR software, I've worked with at least 5 systems (including Cerner, Epic, and VISTA) and while some are far better than others, almost all of them are way too susceptible to social engineering. Or even script kiddie level of hacking knowledge. Sometimes its not the fault of the EHR, but of the systems that use it... I've worked at a place where the password policy was close to nonexistent and the VPN had a shared login. This was at a very large hospital who should have known better.
I'm not saying HIPAA wasn't helpful, it just doesn't protect your information from everyone you think it protects you from. It's overly aggressive in ways that aren't that important (like the baby photo article you posted), but not so much in other ways (insurance companies knowing you have a coded diagnosis of 296.8).

I don't think there is any alternative to what Mike suggests which is nearly as practicable. For Hearn's idea to work, you'd have to have something that each individual owns only one of and can sign a nonce. I've thought about this problem for a while and there's no way I can think that can be used to get everyone a unique smart property without using some sort of central issuer, which will always be met with the same objections.
What gets left out of what Mike is suggesting is that his proposal requires the individual to divulge none of knowledge from that ID, just use a zero-knowledge proof to show that it's unique. I object to it because it gives an ID issuer (governments) the ability to Sybil nodes that are connected through Tor (as opposed to anyone being able to now), but I can't think of an alternative. Perhaps Taaki can.

The best that I think could be used would be a zk-snark system like Hearn's proof-of-passport idea. I don't know if that prevents Sybils or not though. It would be able to tell you if the voting box was stuffed, but I don't know if it would assure one-person one-vote. If you made the vote compulsory that might do the job.
There's a reason voting systems have a large body of crypto research about them.

That's pretty much correct. It's kind of a quick fix. However, I think you should be able to spend your unconfirmed change to self, because it makes bitcoin slightly easier to use... but I think for that to happen now you would have to make bitcoin-qt smart enough to handle the occasionally malleated transaction or (better, but perhaps harder to do) fix the underlying problem with malleability.
Last night, it looked like sipa was providing a way to do the former (with a normalized txid), which is probably a good stopgap measure.
One thing that waiting for confirmation does do is prevent somebody from ascertaining which address is change and which is the payment... so it increases privacy marginally.

I can't afford to lobby, and even if I could, there's so much noise and really really big money in it, that we would be drowned out. No one has a clue how to fix healthcare expenditure in this country because of all the perverse incentives the government has thrown at the problem. You're looking at the Megarich plastic surgeons, orthopods, and assuming that all docs are living such lavish lifestyles. It's just not the case.

The learning point of this is that the enforcement of the exchange of bitcoin should come from the blockchain and cryptographic laws... but no one is competent enough or invested enough to implement it yet. We have the capability of creating an exchange that would be nearly impossible (at least on the BTC side) to have funds misallocated, but we put our trust in centralized systems... when we are using the very technology that can be used to distribute that trust. 
I believe the same can be applied to Coinbase... Bitcoin exchanges could be made nearly impervious to large scale hacks by implementing multisig and appropriate cold storage techniques (and more advanced techniques).

I just want to say that I don't doubt your concerns, and share few of them myself, but I do think this is an idea worth exploring and I want to try to address some of your concerns (this will be long).


It seems to me that there have been a few other people had came up with this idea independently. It seems like killerstorm idea was very similar and etotheipi had similar ideas. So I wouldn't say that it's all originating from Back (who seems to be an altogether well put-together individual who wants to extend benefits of cryptography, not just Bitcoin, to the general public). A lot of great ideas seemed to come out of the Ultimate Blockchain Compression thread... and those threads seemed to originate from a forward thinking group of people, not all of them core devs. The sidechain idea seems like a fairly good solution to *some* of those issues.


I would like to know this, too. It seems as if Mike Hearn and jgarzik are less than enthusiastic about it, but I could be reading too much into their comments. Gavin seemed to think the idea was worth exploring, although the comment came from a tweet.
I think it's also important to point out the code changes will necessarily allow others to explore these concepts as well... the two-way peg that's really the "core" of this idea seems to be very discrete, if it's implemented, Back's company may be "Xerox'd" out of there own innovations. We don't even have a great idea of what they are planning on doing, but I would almost bet it's based on consulting. Also dev's shouldn't be kept from profit-making ventures based on the ideas they've implemented in Bitcoin. Gavin has a consulting gig with coinbase. jgarzik is with Bitpay. They should be paid well for what they are contributing. There has to be an interesection of pragmatics and theory.


It really depends on how well thought out the security model is and for that we need the whitepaper and code. I agree this is a sticking point. I've always considered bitcoin as a global asset ledger. It's security model as absolute as it can be, but the owner of the coins can choose whatever they want to do with them within reason. And as long as the "security firewall" is reasonably simple and relies on tried-and-true crypto I see no problem with it being implemented. After all, P2SH was implemented.


Even if Satoshi didn't provision for this, it doesn't mean anything. Satoshi was not infallible. I have the original source sitting on my computer. I've looked through it. There were bad design decisions that can only been seen in retrospect (paying to IP addresses, original ideas on how to handle certain types of denial of service attacks, and so on). I really don't think his writing can adequately prove he would support this idea or not. But I'll link to something he wrote that seems to be at least tangentially related. 










Emphasis mine. As we know, this idea got neutered in subsequent versions due to the large attack surface. To me, those ideas should be reintroduced as we can understand them. Those disable OPCODES for the most part would almost allow someone to implement a side-chain in a permissionless way anyhow.
~~My model for how Bitcoin should be is very similar to yours, btw.~~ I just think the sidechain idea allows an awesome amount of extensibility while not bloating the "core" with those awesome ideas. Ethereum is a wonderful idea. I love the idea, I'll probably get some, but it seems to me the attack surface is going to be ginormous. I'd rather have Bitcoin be the "wheel-hub" rather than Ethereum. As it stands, Bitcoin's script/P2SH is too neutered to allow that to happen, but only just so.
Ok this post got long and I don't even think I got anywhere near addressing all the concerns, but to me this is an idea worth pursuing to the point where it can be implemented. There is a certain irony that lies beneath all of this: a stripped down altcoin with just the opcodes necessary to support "sidechains" would likely be a worthwhile pursuit.

The difference is the initial transaction in the line of spend-to-self change would be the only one that would go through. All the other broadcasted transactions would be invalid and not modifiable in a way that you could make them spendable. Also the attacker would have a race condition... they wouldn't be able to get their transaction in the blockchain with 100% efficiency like they previously could with the MtGox transactions (because they weren't relayed). To me it seems more likely that the DOSer was doing it for the fun of it. If they stole some funds from Bitstamp, it would be orders of magnitude less than what was stolen from MtGox.
Edit (instead of reposting):


Not exactly the same. While they were both issues with malleability, MtGox had two things going on. They were broadcasting transactions that were not being relayed (ironically because devs made some changes to make some types malleability go away), but could be modified in such away that when rebroadcasted, could be included in a block.

They did manage to have a breach of their database,though. The passwords were hashed and salted if I remember right, but the hashing algorithm they used was not the best. My memory could be off so don't shoot me if I'm wrong. ;)
As an interesting aside, playing poker online traditionally uses a central party to prevent collusion and to assure that cards are truly dealt "at random" for everybody. Advances in cryptography may make it possible to have a P2P version of a poker game exist in the future (with added benefits from P2P: minimal rake and not needed to trust a central party). Bitcoin would be an excellent match for this type of system. This seems to be years out, btw.

Yes, but knowing what I know about the protocol, this idea seems significantly simpler to implement than a turing-complete altcoin.

That's not a real example because it's close to impossible to enforce with physical cash, which is one of the reasons that the use of physical cash is discouraged. With Bitcoin, at this point, it's fairly easy to do. With the "growing up" of bitcoin, those attacks toward the fungibility will come out in full force at the behest of government's around the world. It's not about protecting bank's interests, it's about protecting the people's interest.

Vitalik wasn't the person that came up with smart contracts or any of those scripting potentials, numerous current devs (including Todd, Maxwell, and Hearn) have all spoken at length about implementing them. Those devs have their own weakness and strengths, but to say Vitalik is the smartest in the room is just silly. When you get to that level, it's hard to tell who's the smartest unless you also are one of the smartest. Personally, I think there's a lot of difficult questions that will need to be answered about Bitcoin's economics without adding another complication. Keeping up with all the possible DOS attacks while also gracefully upgrading the system to maintain a bitwise consensus has been difficult with Bitcoin, Ethereum is going to take those problems to another level.
I'm not saying Ethereum is impossible or a scam, I think it's a great test case. I just think its potential for success is less than many believe. I have several reasons to believe that, one of them being that successful implementation of a tree/sidechain tech (*even if* they are initially developed on top of ethereum) will incentivize a minimalist "core" blockchain with just the script necessary to move between the chains rather than all the bells and whistles of Ethereum. That core blockchain, whether it be Bitcoin or otherwise, will likely be the chain that provides the underlying value of it's "constituents." One of those constituents could very well be an implementation which is Turing complete. We shall see though. Excited to see what develops.

That and the vendors using Bitcoin as a portion of their payroll to employees... "Work here and we'll be glad to give you up to 5% of your paycheck in the form of Bitcoin."
I think the regulators realize they have a real problem on their hands, they aren't dumb. Really the only place where effective regulation can take place is the interface between fiat and cryptocurrencies. Any other type of regulation borders on close to unenforceable without being absolutely draconian (e.g. outright ban on the use of cryptocurrencies with onerous punishments for their use).

It's not required for most types of smart contracts, I think it has to do with either transaction replacement (which doesn't work right now) or siganyonecanpay [sic] transactions.

The point is that although there is no way to be 100% secure about anything, keeping Bitcoin in an inherently more secure system should be encouraged. Your risk profile should be concordant with the amount of Bitcoins you own. Holding coins on an exchange where you don't even know the private keys is recipe for disaster. It should be discouraged and it runs counter to one of the primary points of Bitcoin. And it's failed numerous times (I can think of about 5 examples off the top of my head).

Depending on how this gets implemented, I don't even think the ratio has to be fixed, just that there is a clearly defined rule when the side-chain is created.

From Adam Back (emphasis mine):


with same rules to the side-chain it becomes possible with some
modifications to the above algorithm to peg the side-chain to a private
chain.  Private chain meaning a chain with the same format but signature of
single server in place of hashing, and timestamping of the block signatures
in the mined side chain.  And then reactive security on top of that by full
nodes/auditors trying to find fraud proofs (rewrites of history relative to
side-chain mined time-stamp or approved double-spends).  The reaction is to
publish a fraud proof and move coins back to the side chain, and then
regroup on a new server.  (Open transactions has this audit + reactive model
but as far as I know does it via escrow, eg the voting pools for k of n
escrow of the assets on the private server.) I also proposed the same
reactive audit model but for auditable namespaces [4].

You can still look at the signatures as valid, so that means you have to look at the transactions that were sent to that address individually and "match" it to the one that comes from your addresses (and contains your valid signatures)... it's a bit of a workaround. Once it's included in the block that txid could be used for book keeping.
@_date: 2014-03-03 06:26:26
Addresses are not public keys... they are digests of public keys with a checksum at the end.
See here: 
When you sign an transaction, the input has to have the public key in it, so the network can confirm that the hash of the public key corresponds with the public address (since by design, you can't reverse a hash function).
But all the network knows is which address a bitcoin goes to, not what the pubkey that corresponds to that address (until it is spent from).
This actually makes an interesting bit of trivia. Since RIPEMD160 digests are 160 bits, and ECDSA public keys are 256-bits, there's on average 2^256 / 2^160 = 2^96 different public keys that correspond to a single bitcoin address.

Below is all speculation:
With the given information it's really hard to predict. I *know* they had a technical error and that some bitcoins were stolen (or scammed from them). If the amount is covered (by them dipping into their profits) then I think the long term effect will actually be minimal. If they are actually insolvent and don't have the bitcoins to cover their books, the excitement has just started.
I personally feel *this* will not be the death of MtGox, and it certainly won't be the death of Bitcoin.

Bitcoin's landscape is never "normal." The situation occurred for a number of reasons. People have been worried about Mt.Gox's solvency for a while, so whenever something happens people call for its head. They are terrible at PR, which could be the result of legal troubles, insolvency, etc. The point is that most of it was speculation. What wasn't speculation is that they were using a way to track bitcoins to people incorrectly and screwed up. How big of a screw up remains to be seen.

I'll answer this before you get some people insulting you.
When somebody dies without passing on the keys, then yes those Bitcoins are gone. A lot of people with a significant amount of Bitcoins keep them in backed up on pieces of paper, or actually let their family know something about them. It would be the equivalent of burying something of value... it might be lost forever, unless you tell somebody about it.
As far as your second questions, the bitcoin protocol allows for a single bitcoin to be cut into 100 million different pieces (called satoshis). This could be extended if it's ever needed.
As you may or may not know, there are other cryptocurrencies called altcoins... one of which really illustrates that point 21coin - there's only 21 full coins available.
Edit: As far as the fear of coins being found in the future and disrupting world economies, I think there will be a point when we use proofs-of-burn or hardforks secondary to need for upgrading crypto, coins will have to be moved by necessity.

It's really a misunderstanding of the economics involved. The ability to verify transactions costs cents on the dollar. The ability to secure those same transactions as a group is much more expensive. That security doesn't depend on the number of transactions, however. So any increase in the transactions per second decreases the cost per transaction. That's why Gavin wants to increase the block size in the future.
It's a problem of looking at a dynamic system and assuming it's currently in a steady state when it's not.

It's actually pretty important *desirable* property to have in a currency, because it decreases threats to fungibility. Imagine the $100 bill that you have in your wallet was used in a crime 6 transactions ago. You go to the store and try to spend it... and they look in their database and that bill is "flagged" as being worth less because it was associated with a crime for which no one has been convicted of yet. Now your $100 bill can't be exchanged for $100 dollars worth of goods, all because the previous non-anonymous "illicit" transaction occurred with it.
If you have the time and technical expertise, this is the best interview that explains why these things are important:
Fungibility must be preserved.

There's some thought that Plan B may inhibit implantation of an already fertilized egg, but that's probably not the case based on current best evidence.

It's really hard to stay completely anonymous, but here are some tips off the top of my head. It might be overkill:
Buy coins in an anonymous or pseudonymous fashion. Use a mixing service anyway. Do not use clients that send change back to same address (use either electrum, armory or qt). Use Tor. Use a computer booted from a livecd. Store your encrypted wallet in a truecrypt volume. 
Be aware it's a lot easier to lose your coins because there are multiple steps that might screw you over.

I'm disappointed in the community in more ways than one. I don't know how many times I've said that keeping your coins in an exchange, especially Gox, is a bad idea. You only own the coins that you have the private keys to and NO ONE else has. What I don't like about this more is that evil people have money that they stole now... it's going to take a long time for those people to come to justice if ever.
And to the people at Gox... the level of incompetence is so breathtaking I just can't even comprehend.
I'll also say this: bitcoin isn't ready for primetime. It's ready for the techies, the security experts, the hackers, and programmers... We don't even have a hardware wallets yet, which would be the minimum expectation to get people to secure their coins.
The use of POW/Block chain is potentially revolutionary... I'm not sure if Bitcoin is going to flourish. Destroyed coins are one thing (and that part is well designed), coins in the hands of thieves is much worse to me. (I still think it will flourish, though - just my 95% confidence has dropped to 90%).
That said... My bitcoins are sitting in various locations. I've never lost any in the years that I've been involved. I have a lot less than I should because I'm super conservative.
I'll leave with this, something I posted before most of this went down:
* Don't leave money on exchanges unless you are a day trader. 
* Don't use online wallet services, unless they are open source and they don't actually have access to your keys (blockchain.info). 
* Always use 2FA in all services that allow it. Never use a service that doesn't allow 2FA to transact bitcoin. 
* Never use an unsecure email address... enable 2FA on your email address login. 
* Use only open source software to store your bitcoins. 
* Don't use Windows to store large amounts of bitcoins, even if your wallet is encrypted. Keep multiple wallets with different appropriate security levels for how they are used.
* Do not ever use Brainwallets unless you are an expert.
* Don't use paperwallets unless you are an expert. Always practice with small transactions first. Learn about change addresses.
* Don't own more than you are comfortable losing.
* You don't own bitcoin unless you and only you have access to the private keys.

I really like Andreas, but I think he's being a bit heavy-handed with his comments which are almost nearing condemnation of the developers. I lurk through the Dev board and the mailing list quite a bit and it seems to me that many of the people that are contributing to Bitcoin are attuned to the needs to increase the anonymity (and thus fungibility and usefulness) of Bitcoin as much as possible. It's not that it is not needed, it a question on how it can best be done. He uses the analogy of upgrading a plane in flight which I feel is an apt one, but I can tell you strapping a 1200 HP turbine engine to an airframe that was designed for 200 HP prop will cause a lot of problems. Zerocoin is a 1200 HP engine that requires significant network resources to support. So compromises have to be taken until such a time that cryptographic state-of-the-art comes to point where it can be added to Bitcoin safely.

Well there are some interesting things about that address. I think this is probably a hot address for an exchange or a big company like bitpay. The reason I say this is that is directly sending transactions to addresses that have had very large amounts of bitcoins go through them. Which address is yours? Did you make any transactions from your multibit wallet before this happened? I've seen people screw up using the UI on multibit and send coins to an address they thought they owned on accident.

I think one of the biggest problems we as humans face is the acceptance of a rigid dogma as the ideal. There are aspects from many different political, economic, and social systems that work. Rules and beliefs that work in families don't work on national scale. The same law in one country which works might not work in another because of cultural or socioeconomic differences. What I like about libertarianism/anarchism is that they accept that humans behave in selfish ways. However, I do not believe they have it all right and that without certain strongly held beliefs in charity, a libertarian is often the worst type of person. They can also be the best kind of person.

Thanks for the tip.
Remember there's two ways to lose your Bitcoins: an attacker steals your private key or you lose your private key (e.g. natural disaster, making a transaction where the change is sent to a different public address which you carelessly forget to save, creating a m-of-n wallet and losing too many of the keys, lost passphrase, you die, etc.) It's important to think about your key storage strategy based on all the circumstances that you want to prevent against. BIP38 is great if you think your physical security could be compromised, but not so great if you die and your family can't guess your password. Personally, I use SSSS + deterministic because it seems the most robust, but for another person it might not be the right choice.


An electrum phrase isn't really a brainwallet in the traditional sense. The source of the entropy comes from elsewhere (by your computer's RNG or diceware, however you'd like to source it), but the key is represented in a way that make you more capable of remembering it. 
Think of it this way: binary can represent 1-bit per unit digit, decimal can represent ~3.3 (2^x = 10, solve for x) bits per unit digit, and hexadecimal can represent 4 bits per unit digit. So 1111 = 15 = 0x0F ... They all mean 15, just in a different "base". Well, let's say instead of numbers as the units place, we use a set of words from a wordlist which has 2048 different words in it. What we have essentially done is create a base-2048 system, meaning each unit can represent 11 bits of data (2^x = 2048, solve for x). So 12 digits of our word list could represent 132 bits of data.
A more traditional brainwallet, which people lost a lot of money to, was taking a passphrase such as "I lik3 waffles!!!" and running that through a hash function (typically SHA) to produce their private key. What people soon found out is what you think might be the most "so random" password would be found by a collection of GPUs in a few days. I would never advise anyone to use that kind of brainwallet unless they really knew what they were doing and why they were doing it. I can only think of the scenario of fleeing under duress and the brainwallet being part of your "jump-bag," and a mnemonic phrase (like what electrum uses) would be better any way.
My strategy would be this: Generate a deterministic key. Memorize it using a standard mnemonic wordlist (like the one that electrum uses) and then use SSSS to split the keys and store them in physically secure locations. You never have to depend on SSSS if you can remember your seed, but if you forget it, then you can fall back to it. Additionally you can use your phrase on a offline computer, type it in, spend from the wallet, the change will be sent to a new address which gives you better anonymity.

I don't think you're missing anything. I think Gavin's point is that if you already relying on some sources of central trust to get a contract to function, why not offload all of that into a m-of-n system. He admits he's cheating. DACs are far future to me for both legal and technical reasons, but the goal of achieving them is certainly laudable.
We don't even have really usable wallet software and security structures in place and we are already talking about cars that own themselves and data that persists without human interaction. I think that's awesome, but it's less than pragmatic. We all know it's possible, and I'm very excited about it, but I see a few complete failures happening before we get there.

Nope, you make some sense. You have to have a fairly good understanding of why proof-of-work requires value be assigned to the unit of account. In order to incentivize miners to devote computational work to securing the blockchain, they have to have a reasonable reward for providing that service. That reward is the "coinbase" transaction they are allowed to pay to themselves when they find the block. So in the systems which uses the advantages of the security of the block, there has to be at least some value and incentive to use the "basic" bitcoin unit. Otherwise the entire security model is invalidated.
Think of "raw" bitcoins as untamed wilderness and colored coins or other exotic uses of the blockchain as developed land. You can't build a skyscraper without the ground.

I think that's giving Gox a *little* too much credit... I think the vulnerability was known about, the other exchanges had some occasional bugs on the closing of their accounts and it was brought to everyone's attention that the malleability problem may be responsible, so that's good. I don't know if gmaxwell scooped the problem, but it's funny that he mentioned the vulnerability before Gox came out and said it... it was wrong for Gox to say all exchanges are affected. They (mostly) were, but not to the extent that they had coins stolen... I hope Gox will do a follow-up and explicitly tell us how many coins were stolen.

True true. I'm only being half-serious when I say that. I do think it can hurt just a little (with a probable net benefit). The fragmentation in the community brings great ideas up, but it also makes it hard for an outsider looking in to really take that first step. It's the nature of the open-source decentralized beast, though.
It kind of reminds me when I started looking into linux (years ago). Slackware was the dominant distro if I remember correctly. I got it installed (multiple 3.5'' floppies) and played around with. It was cool, but really rough around the edges. I think we are in that era in the cryptocurrency space.

Looks like you got pretty good answers already. I will say when you store your bitcoins at coinbase, they are managing your bitcoins for you and you are trusting them to do so. With blockchain, bitcoins stored there come with the freedom know that if blockchain goes under, you'll still have your bitcoins (if you follow proper security precautions).

I don't think he's adequately proven that there is a lot of "fragility" in the system, as he puts it (regarding the quieting period, etc.). It seems like atomic coins swaps is where most of the "liquidity" between chains is supposed to go through.

I think it will be hardware wallets with BIP38-like backups and smart contracts/deadman's switches set to send coins to a predetermined address based on lock times and external states (Edit: of course all this techno mumbojumbo will be abstracted away from the user).


I'm divided on this. I'm starting to think its going to be pretty evenly divided based on user preferences. It will probably be country dependent and dependent on the philosophy of the user.


This is kind of the same question. I think it will be 50/50. I think users will also have different wallets and learn not to put all their eggs in one basket. I certainly believe we can make the process of owning bitcoin almost idiot resistant.


Same as above.
Edit: I should point out some of your criticisms of Trezor have already been addressed by the Trezor team. Having the device stolen or destroyed doesn't not necessitate you losing your bitcoins if you follow their recommended practices by using a PIN/OTP system as well as keeping a paper backup of the seed.

I actually think we have a few trolls here that "believe" in bitcoin, but are not nearly as excited about the economic implications. They urge temperance and I on some level agree with them. Bitcoin, to me, is the [L'Obeissante]( of cryptocurrency... we haven't even made it to the Model T. There are technical hurdles that *must* be addressed before it's even possible to use bitcoin in a Global Environment at anything approaching a reasonable number of transactions per second. Personally, I'm optimistic that solutions will come about, either in Bitcoin itself or a very closely related successor.

Well, a lot of people said the same kind of things about Madoff. That said, I think your theory is just as valid as anyone else here. Lost keys explains a lot, but it's also the thing that people hope for, so there's a lot of cognitive bias towards that. If he's embarrassed by losing the keys, or his system chewing up the keys, then he needs to come clean. There's profoundly different implications for the market. Also forensic examination of his system in the current state may provide for some recoveries in the case that his system chewed up the keys.

This difference is there will be a failure of the "network" to notice this transaction as an attempted double-spend until that double-spend is already included in a block.
This is a specific type of double-spend attack called a Finney attack - it requires a miner to cooperate with the attempt so that the attacker can be "invisible" until they've already succeeded.

Even bitcoin-qt builds a pool of private ahead of what you are using. Only if you exhaust that pool will you lose your private keys. Electrum and Armory (and any other HD wallets) you only need to back up once (unless you import a private key that is not part of the chain).
One good solution is to work on the ergonomics of how people store and backup their bitcoins. We need to provide solutions that make it hard for people to do stupid things. It's getting better, but not as fast as I would like.
We should approach these problems from all aspects (improving exchanges, improving UI, improving best practice recommendations, etc.)

I think there's going to be "land" of bitcoins that are designated for a certain purposes (colored coins, etc.). Miners will be creating undeveloped land of Bitcoin and reclaiming used "land" paid as fees.
Another possible future that we should consider is that a better digital money than bitcoin that has a more perfect fungibility layer comes into existence. In that situation the buy-in may be a bitcoin proof-of-burn that can be made at any time into the future. You can burn your bitcoins for the fungible currency, or you can choose to keep your bitcoins for their non-fungible properties that are more useful as a property/asset ledger. This changes the way that fees and rewards would have to be handled, but I bet you could make it where the fees would actually represent small amounts of ownership of the whole asset economy. Miners would essentially churn out fee rewards that represent the whole of the "non-money" bitcoin economy.
BTW, this guy's blog is a treasure trove of ideas regarding how the Bitcoin can be used. He has a deep understand of what bitcoin is and he's the originator of the "on the blockchain no one knows you're a fridge" quote. I highly recommend looking at his RTGS article too.

Interesting read. There certainly a lot that makes stealth addresses seem kind of "hacked" together, but I'm wondering if that's not something that could be reasonably fixed (or if the developers have any inclination to fix that). On the face of it, Mike's ideas seem less hacky, but Todd et al. are implementing in a permissionless way. I don't really see a wrong in that. It's unfortunate that people do bad and stupid things to pollute the block chain, but you can't just say "don't do that!", you should also be able to say "do this instead." Of course, that's what Hearn is doing in this article.
A core sentence of the article:


Agree. Keep working on the tools, but don't expect others to play by your games until your tools are better than their hacks.
The opposing argument to this is that the Bitcoin network should carry all the information needed to redeem a transaction and we shouldn't have to depend on other infrastructure outside of that network. I'm not sure I agree with that argument, but it's certainly not silly. I think there are centralization risks to what Hearn is proposing because of that.
Fun, complicated, fun.

Gavin Andresen - July 9th 2010
It is a bubble, but it's a bubble in a new type of asset class that we don't understand yet... people are proposing it can be used for many different things.
Those use-cases haven't matured, but since I've been here a lot of it has become a lot easier to do. The time to really worry is after a bubble where new things don't get proposed/implemented.
The majority of the value that is priced in to bitcoin is speculation on its future uses. It may be incorrect to think bitcoin would be a good remittance tool. We may be incorrect to think that bitcoin could be useful for an open real-time gross settlement system. We may be incorrect to think that bitcoin can be used as a low-cost contract enforcement platform. We may be incorrect that bitcoin could be used as a globally tracked asset ledger. We may be wrong that autonomous agents would be useful. Or we could be right about one of those things... and that's all it takes to justify the value.
@_date: 2014-04-10 19:24:28
I think it would really depend on what kind of failure happens. My guess it would be one of two different options:
* An attacker figures out the signature scheme is screwed up in a such a way that anyone can spend any one elses sidecoins. In this case, he could unfreeze the associated bitcoins by burning everybody's sidecoins.
* A more general security failure for whatever reasons makes it impossible to unfreeze the bitcoins. In this case, the bitcoins would be considered burned (noncollectable).
These are just guesses. Once more concrete implementations details are out, we'll know more.

This is actually a great way to make a hardware wallet much cheaper and smaller. Instead of dedicated display you could use a PGP-like message system that communicates with your smart phone to "confirm" your signed transaction (you would still have hardware buttons on the device itself). The attack vector would be infecting the smartphone and displaying the "wrong" transaction, but this could actually be minimized because you could display a flashing LED on the device synchronized with smartphones on screen "LED." as a visual interpretation of a hash. The potential benefit (and device footprint) would be amazing.

He's just been saying this kind of analysis can be wrong or right with very little that can be proven... so it's just baseless speculation. A single hop from a known MtGox address is enough to secure those coins in your possession or lose them forever. Could be friend or foe. Or it could have been Mark who accidently sent them to address that he doesn't own when he was trying to fix something... It's all speculation and tea leaf reading. Unless you find an address that is proven to be a Gox address that has coins in it, then those coins can't be proven to be owned by Gox or anyone associated with Gox beyond a reasonable doubt.
In fact, a couple years ago, a large portion of coins had been through a single Gox address.

Please don't take offense, I'm not trying to talk down to you...
A QR code is a way to store data in a way that a computer with a camera can interpret easily. It can contain a URL, a small instruction, or just about any piece of (small) data. So a QR code can contain a private key, but it's not the same thing. A paper wallet doesn't have to have a QR code on it.
I get the feeling you don't exactly understand digital signatures. If that's the case, I can help you out.
To spend it again you would take that private key and reimport it into wallet software... all the major wallets have a way to do this, but they're all kind of different so I can't really go into details.
There's even a way (that Armory makes easiest) where the transaction can be signed by an offline computer (you bring the transaction you want signed from the online computer, sign it, then take the signed transaction back to the online computer and broadcast it).

I always see these kinds of posts as a misunderstanding of history of digital moneys, cryptography, and computer science. Flooz was not the first failed digital cash product.   It wasn't the last. It wasn't even that advanced of one for its time. There is a lot of "prior art" in the field, but the crux of the problem was the solution to the double-spend problem... all prior solutions required a central authority and didn't have a complex feedback-loop system to keep user incentive alive **despite the number of users**. The prior solutions required the financial well being of central authority. Bitcoin requires a cumultive well-being in the collection of it's participants (and it doesn't care about anything else). Bitcoin works with 10 people, it works with 100, it works with 1000, it works with 10,000. We'll see if it works well for more.
The problem with Bitcoin is that decentralized/distributed computing is hard to design for. Consensus systems are notoriously finicky to get to work right. The fact that bitcoin got out of the "hey I have this idea" stage is really quite amazing. People don't know how to develop strong crypto applications... only a small subset of developers and academics understand cryptography and security well enough to actually develop it.
I've been involved in Bitcoin for a few years. I would **never** recommend my family use it. It's not ready at all. It can be made ready. Multisig wallets and hardware wallets are a big step in the right direction. Bitpay actually developing usable software for mid-level developers is a big thing. Flooz was simple to use. It worked just like every other system anyone else has used. Bitcoin is different.

My understanding is that the way it is implemented it would leak a lot of privacy related information, but the key management was secure (well as secure as any other hot wallet).

That's pretty much it, except the fee structure is necessarily going to be different for each sidechain. Zerocoin signature proofs are longer than a traditional bitcoin proof, so you'd have to (in some way that's yet undefined, but seems implementable) make the reward adequate enough for miners to merge mine that specific sidechain.

That's a bit of a false choice. If the rules are unjust then a person should be able choose to not participate in that injustice, especially in the circumstance that it harms other people. Alternatively, those that want to make the choice to participate in debate should at least understand they are participating because it's the lesser of two evils. Rational individuals can (and have) done both.
I do believe the US (and many other countries around the world) have little more to do to have turnkey tyranny and it could have all happened in an misguided attempt to improve security rather than active malice. The engine might not be started, but the keys are in the ignition. I certainly hope (and still believe) that the answer to the problem is in open debate, but I can't fault those that are less optimistic. I value their opinions, but they won't win unless they have the ability to inspire.

OK this will be like ELI a CS undergrad:
Bitcoin really isn't encrypted. It uses cryptographic signatures and hashes. The three most important hashing/signature algorithms used by Bitcoin are ECDSA (with secp256k1 curve), SHA-256, and RIPEMD160. Quantum computing (not like D-wave which uses "quantum annealling") offers a way to solve a problem quickly that is used as the basis for a lot of the cryptography we currently use. That problem is called the discrete-logarithm problem and its meant to be very very hard problem to solve in reverse. Quantum computers offer the possibility to solve that problem quickly (if they can be created with the number of qubits required to make the computation - which remains to be seen). It would break ECDSA (but probably not RIPEMD) if it was reliable and fast... which would invalidate the security model that protects bitcoin addresses that have been spent from previously (which really should be none of them if bitcoin was being used right). The good news is that there are signature algorithms that are though to be quantum resistent, the bad news is that implementing them today would cause the blockchain to grow faster than we can afford right now. Any questions?

There are a couple of different services you can use depending on how serious you are. The two big competitors in the United States are Bitpay and Coinbase... They both offer a service that "converts" bitcoin to fiat automatically and deposits it to the bank account. Their sign-up process is very similar to signing up to a credit card company - you give them a bank acct  a tax id, and a little info about your business and then you get approved.
After you are approved, the next step would be to set up your point-of-sale system. The easiest would be a tablet device that has a coinbase app or bitpay app in place. To see a working example (using Bitpays system) click [here](
There are also multiple other ways to accept bitcoin. If you want to just accept it straight without the option to convert to fiat automatically, all you need is to generate an address (1payme....) and put on your counter. The disadvantages are people will be able to see how much you are being paid by others since the address doesn't change and the inability to convert directly to USD.
If you have further questions, feel free to follow up.

Agreed the user is the one with the hot wallet. But there's a big security distinction in saying the server has possession of private keys that can be used for signing transactions versus having possession of encrypted private keys for which they don't know the key to decrypt. 
I use both Coinbase and blockchain for small amounts even though neither security model is perfect.  I think it's important to be aware the differences and realize they each have their tradeoffs. Personally I have seen way too many failures of sites that don't give you access to your keys.

Bitcoin is pretty classic example of what happens when a more traditional classification system fails (see Linnaean taxonomy or mixed connective tissue diseases). It's almost always caused by a classification system not being general enough to handle a new idea (or disease or organism). The solution would be to make a more general classification system . Of course, if you over generalize you lose the whole purpose of a classification system in the first place. To me, it's not truly a commodity money, currency, commodity, etc. It most closely resembles money as memory with a upward bound on production... I really don't understand why economists aren't jumping at taking a look at it through a completely different lens. Instead, they take old ideas and try to bash the square peg into a round hole.

If it was just a clean cut and reburied, you would still get water at the site... it would just be contaminated. 80,000 gallons / month works out to be a &lt; 2 gpm, so less than a low flow shower head puts out. A 1/2'' schedule 40 PVC pipe can support a flow rate of 14 gpm easily. So I doubt anyone would notice for a while, as the head loss would not be that significant. If the pipe was cut where it all flowed out then it would only take about 3-4 days to put out 80,000 gallons (at the lower end of flow rates).

I'll second this as a good option and one that I have personally used. Seems to work well. I would say that if you do this, even if your private key is in your phone's RAM momentarily, I would still consider that paper wallet as "compromised" and you should consider moving the rest of your coins to a newly generated paper wallet. I wouldn't fret for small amounts, but generally people that are using paper wallets have much more than that.

**On average** a block is released every 10 minutes. Imagine you have set of dice and you are only ever able to release a block when you roll a 12. You have a 1 in 36 chance of making that roll on each time. Sometimes you might get lucky and roll in twice in row (1 in 1296), but for the most part you roll it less often than that. That's pretty much what the bitcoin network is doing. It's a bunch of miners that are rolling dice and when they get a certain number they are allowed to release a block. The math works out (and the dice are adjusted) such that everybody rolling their dice together finds the right answer every 10 minutes (it's actually a little faster).
Every block, 25 bitcoins are released to the miner that finds that block. This number halves every four years.


No, but for a couple different reasons. Worse case scenario for a single confirmation is actually longer than 10 minutes (the miners are having a run of bad luck), but usually it's much less. If your transaction comes out 2 minutes before a block is released, there's a good chance that it will end up in that block. So you can have "confirmations" in less than 10 minutes usually.
The next question is what does a confirmation mean? It's the network providing reasonable assurance the transaction has not been double-spent. For most honest wallets/transactions they are seen propagating the network in seconds. If the wallet user is not trying to commit fraud this is probably reasonable to accept payment without having him to wait around. There are some attacks and ways to defraud these types of transactions (Called 0-confirmation transactions), but for now it's reasonably safe (especially if the customer is a repeat user of your service - the type of fraud there commiting is the similar to passing a fake bill or fraudulently charging back their credit card).

Pretty much the influence that an economy based on a p2p system affects how people act within that system.

Although I think Mike sometimes comes up with ideas that are a bit overly centralized in nature, that idea bore out of a real problem and he presented a fairly practical solution. 
The interesting part about that idea was that it was zero-knowledge: You could prove you had a passport but not reveal any other information about yourself - including who you were. It was simply a way to assign a "one-person, one-vote" to the system. The system was inherently anonymous, though. Any other issued system that contained a smart enough chip in it to sign a nonce would have been workable, and it was kind of regrettable that Mike Hearn chose passport as his example. 
I still don't think it was a great idea and I hope for a better, more decentralized solution that doesn't rely on centralized issuance.

If I wasn't going to work I'd provide a detailed answer for this, but the answer is yes it would work. But the chances of it happening anytime soon are close to nil. I thought about adding a digital signature to each of my physical prescriptions based on the name of the patient and timestamp. That of course wouldn't prevent double spending, but it would cut down on a large amount of fraud if universally adopted. It should be noted a large amount of prescription fraud is through diversion too (legit script that the patient sells the drug from). 
Nevertheless, some crypto systems built into prescription handling would be welcome. I'll try to expand once I'm off work, because I've thought about this a lot.

As for another example, I don't think there is one... do you think it would be possible to make one? The only objection I had to the idea was the authority could forge documents. That seems like a surmountable problem (though less practical).

Mining centralization is certainly a threat to the system. There are varying changes that have been suggested that limit the usefulness of centralized mining power, but not really a whole lot of satisfactory answers.
You have to think about different things that promote centralization vs promoting or limiting decentralization. As the blockchain grows, this provides centralization pressure of not just the miners, but the nodes, but at what rate is it acceptable? The idea of side-chains seems to add some centralization pressure as well. P2Pool/getblocktemplate make it a bit easier for small miners to get a fair shake. The cost of ASICs and competition is decentralizing some of the mining power (after initial centralization. Yifu Gao told a story where he was carrying enough chips to 51% the network at one point). The ability to waste heat appropriately is easier when it's decentralized. Electricity costs in different parts of the world is a centralizing force.
The point is the number of variables in the system is multiple and we don't have a great answer. I'm sure others have modeled it, but as far as I know there is no great research published on it.

Zero Knowledge Succinct Non-interactive Arguments of Knowledge. It's bleeding-edge cryptography that borders on magic (some of what it can do just sounds downright impossible).

I'll comment. There's a few things that default nodes prioritize when deciding which transactions get priority. Higher fee per KB transactions get higher priority than lower fee per KB transactions. Transactions without fees are prioritized by how old the transaction that the coins were spent in last. This prevents a denial of service attack where a person sends a low value transaction back and forth to themselves. You can get a free transaction with coins from an older transaction, but with a new transaction it will necessitate a fee (because it has a high likelihood of not being included in the blockchain).
There's some other intricate rules about how certain sized transactions will be included or not.

Yes, but the point is that you must rely on trusted sources to ~~execute~~ supply feed data for a contract, which is unlike Bitcoin. Bitcoin, aside from some timestamps in the blocks is mostly independent from any source of outside trust, it's as agnostic as it gets (at least for now). Ethereum may be about decoupling those things, but they still rely on outside sources of information... building those sources of information to be robust and as close to tamper proof as possible doesn't require ethereum at all, and yet ethereum will depend on them to be useful.
I'm not saying that ethereum isn't a great idea. I just don't think it's going to butter my toast in the morning like they say it will.
Edit: clarified. Thanks drcode.

Here's some tips for you... you can keep multiple wallets, and it's actually preferable to the experience. Armory is great for security, but it's a bit klunky for day to day purchases. Multibit/Electrum have better experiences for the PC. The method I use really though is to keep a spending amount (what I would carry in my wallet in cash) in Mycelium on Android. Even when I make purchases from my computer I use it to scan QR codes and send. Even with a password it's faster than typing a CC number in.
I was curious so I just timed myself how long it would take to buy humble bundle using my method. 10 seconds. It would have taken longer to type my CC number in, expiration, and CVV code.
Regardless, a lot of the user experience will improve once payment protocol is more prevalent.

Bitgold has some fairly distinct difference from bitcoin, it was not Sybil resistant and lacked fungibility between units (IIRC). It's very possible bitcoin could be an evolution of that idea, but you couId say the same for b-money which is arguably closer. Not saying that Szabo definitely isn't Satoshi, but there's enough for him to deny it. 
It is worth pointing out that a viable cryptocash has been one of the holy grails in cypherpunk culture for a while, so I don't think two similar systems presented at similar times is damning evidence. I think Back, Dai, Finney, Szabo are all candidates, but it could just be an unknown since that culture is full of pseudonymous individuals.

By taint I mean the ability to distinguish how a Bitcoin UTXO was used since its coinbase transaction. This is recorded in perpetuity. There are huge privacy implications, especially under repressive governments.
I agree the practical implications at this time are almost nil, especially if you aren't using them for anything that is considered illegal or unwarranted. That may not be always the case, however.
The problem comes with this is that any change to the paper money system that would allow effective tracking of all fiat would be prohibitively expensive and would almost certainly have fungibility implications (no one would want to trade one dollar for another without being able to check the "registry" to make sure that note was not used for an illegal activity). A important difference between Bitcoin and paper money is that any change that would allow effective tracking of paper money would be prospective, not retrospective. Few businesses have to track the serial numbers of individual reserve notes that flow through their systems, but with Bitcoin, this is pretty much automated. And with the reduced entropy of how many of the light wallets handle change, the KYC/AML regulations in place at exchanges, and the pervasive datamining that's probably already occurring on the blockchain there could certainly be fungibility concerns in the future.


I surely do, but can you tell me which of the 10 dollar bills in my wallet came from a criminal? No one can, unless "they" had recorded the serial numbers of the bills beforehand.

The probability of that occurring in roulette is 1 in (2^150). The combination in a well shuffled deck of cards (52!) has probably never existed before, and this is many number of magnitudes greater likelihood to have happened. That number is so stupidly low that for all practical purposes it is impossible to have occurred. And if it did, every rational person would suspect foul play. It's the same with bitcoin hashrates. A 20 core CPU miner in current network conditions would have an average block generation time of 76,000 years. You could get extraordinarily lucky, but its probability is on the order of being hit by a meteorite or struck by lightning at the same time. Sure it could happen, but it won't.

So right now each block is limited at 1 MB worth of transactions, which corresponds to a max of 7 tps. It's not  a lot more computationally difficult to include more transactions in larger blocks, just that it requires more bandwidth and storage space. The eventual expectation however would be that the rate of transactions will go up per block, meaning the block reward per transaction will go down. Additionally the block reward drops by half every four years, meaning the block reward per transaction will go down some more. Additionally, there's also some newer ideas about making very small, frequent blocks with a new "winning" chain rule with the added benefit of the supported rate of transactions will go up as well.
What I'm trying to get at is the things that you are worrying about are problems that are going to be years out and we already have solutions that are being floated now to address them.
Further, Bitcoin mining acts like a complex feed-back loop with negative and positive influences on it. Miners, when they act rationally (hah!), should approach a "set point" that is just barely profitable (like any other automatized industry should). At this point in Bitcoin's young life, mining has to be subsidized simply because it provides the entirety of the security as the actual currency and payment system develops around it.

Agree on the satellite network. This would actually help with that. Imagine you broadcast a transaction on the shortwave, and confirm it from a overhead satellite. Packet radio doesn't have the necessary bandwidth to send new blocks, but a satellite would. Conversely, the hardware required to broadcast to a satellite is much more expensive than the hardware needed to transmit a transaction by radio.

You burn up the paper, the gold exists... but that doesn't change the fact there is a hard control to how many notes you can produce. The paper money still has a hard constraint.
You can have a fractional reserve of Bitcoin as well. As evidence just look at MtGox, it's becoming more and more evident they were running a fractional system. But in a fractional system based on gold-redeemable notes, M0 would be redeemable for gold, M1 wouldn't necessarily be. Same with Bitcoin.


Agree it's unstable, but in the situation where you designing something that is meant to be decentralized how can you design a central control point into the system? If you can think of a better way of doing it without involving a centralized control, then suggest it. One of the main reasons people are using Bitcoin is that very reason, it's unseizable and can't be control a central system. It's meant to be decentralized and give control back to the individual.


And they should be free to. There's more than 30 alternatives that exist right now (Peercoin, Dogecoin, Namecoin, Litecoin, etc.). None of them have taken a sizeable amount of the market share from Bitcoin. And that is because Bitcoin has the developers, the merchants, the exchanges, and the computational power. That's a lot of network effect to overcome. I could make a twitter competitor tomorrow, but without the users it wouldn't be useful.


My point is that Bitcoin doesn't have to be a currency to be useful. It just has to do one thing better than the current financial ecosystem for it to have value.

But I still wouldn't trade with the FBI, I'd have outed my ownership of those coins and they would know that I have the coins they gave me. It might be trivial to tumble, coinjoin, etc. to get them back to a "cleaner" state, but that's extra work on my part and the FBI might take offense to that.

No because including those double-spend transactions in his blocks do not change the amount of work that needs to be done (on average) to find a block. He's just mining with a different set of transactions that other people didn't see. He still has a 5% chance of finding the next block.
It's important to note that miners can pick and choose any valid transaction to include in their blocks and it doesn't really change the probability that they will find a block. In fact, some miners choose not to broadcast larger blocks because it takes longer to broadcast those blocks which leaves them with a marginally higher chance to become orphans.
Edit: The evil miner is always trying double-spends and the evil customers are always trying. They don't know when they will be successful, they just know they will be 5% of the time.

The destruction of Bitcoins in the hands of earlier adopters is really of little significance (and has occurred often, especially in the beginning)... for the socialists among us, it actually redistributes the wealth through a "burn."

I think English isn't your first language, so I am having trouble understanding your point.
The generation of coins and collection of transaction fees are inextricably linked to the security model that protects the blockchain. There has to be mining or else there is no immutable log. The miners in this specific situation (mining in place of ads) would be in a pooled setup and almost certainly wouldn't be privvy to the actual transactions they are mining. This gives the pool operator sole discretion on what gets included. They are *not acting as nodes* that relay transactions or verify work, they are zombies.

Because it wasn't possible to exploit in the same way. Bitstamp uses Bitcoind (official daemon) which would generate transactions that would be relayed and mined. The change would be sent back to self and bitcoind's accounting would get gummed up when a mutated txid (that the DOS was producing) was included in a block rather than what it expected. But it didn't cause them to lose coins, just caused bitcoind to get confused. It should be noted that there are probably other ways to DOS the Bitcoin network, too.
MtGox's failure was two-fold: they were broadcasting transactions that would not be mined/rebroadcast by the majority of nodes (running newer versions of the software), but they could still be seen and modified in such a way that they would be included. So an attacker would get their "automatic" refund, and then rebroadcast the previously poorly formatted transaction modified to where it would be included, thus getting more than one payment.

I don't have a great link, but if you click your link again, click "all time" then click logarithmic you'll see flat slightly downward sloping area in the graph, because it's log form a slight drop is actually quite significant (mouse over for values).
So difficulty retargeting happens every 2016 blocks in Bitcoin. If the hashrate drops to 50%, the shares of blocks you will find will effective double, so there's still some incentive to continue mining. In fact, now that we have dedicated hardware that pretty much can only be used for mining, you pretty much have a sunk cost of the initial investment plus the ongoing cost of the electricity. Since there is no other big altcoins that use SHA-256 there is no place to move the hashrate (as long as it pays back better than the cost of electricity).
What would likely happen in the case of a major hashrate disturbance (EMP, war, internet being eliminated in a high population area, etc.) is that a hard-fork with a more frequent difficulty recalculation would come about. (or later developments that more fluidly adjust difficulty Edit: see secret_bitcoin_logins comment regarding the Gravity Well solution).

So zerocoin would be wonderful, but the signatures would be larger in size and the cryptography it's based on isn't as battle-tested as the cryptography that is used in Bitcoin right now. It goes against scaling the transactional speed of the network... so there's some balance there.
On the otherhand, from my understanding (which is limited) coinjoin+stealth addresses really offer something that can be implemented with little cost.
I personally don't think we should use "privacy" as our argument for these changes, but rather "fungibility." We need to prevent people from assigning taint to coins, because once we have centralized databases of "bad addresses" and "bad coins" set up we are going to really have a problem. The privacy is an added benefit.
I personally think the lighter clients spending change to the same address is a problem, too.

When a bitcoin node resets its mempool is cleared. So the transaction will be forgotten when the last node that has memory of that transaction is turned off. If the transaction remains valid you could rebroadcast it if you wanted.
Some transactions are forgotten a lot quicker if they don't conform to a certain standard but are still valid because nodes may choose not to relay them.

If anything, the Bitcoin Foundation or a similar third party industry system could pay devs to review it, but not Trezor themselves. This is a separate and different type of security measure from a code audit.
Speaking of which, are you still going to have audit performed by a firm as well?
Also are you going to use a open license on the hardware designs?

I'm still trying to wrap my mind around it, but this is what I got so far: it's a way to extend the amount of transactions per second and try experimental ideas using smart contracts and merge mining techniques, but still provide the underlying security model of Bitcoin. It sounds kind of like a "reversible" proof-of-burn... you can get your bitcoins back if a "side-chain" project fails.
Edit: I would be advise watching this idea, especially with Adam Back behind it.

For the majority of patients I see in the hospital, I'll bill a 99232. That works out to be about 50-60$ per day per patient for my services. I consider that a reasonable fee (compare to other professionals). The hospital bills somewhere around 8-20x what I bill for.

Chains not being used at all will simply die... Bitcoin will bleed out of them. For example in my case DNSC is the superior to NSC... users will switch out of it until NSC just doesn't exist anymore.


Absolutely not, it will just be a subset of the total base of Bitcoin. Any value-added services will expand that sidechains market cap, which will necessarily increase Bitcoin's cap. It's important to realize this is cryptographically secured.... anyone can put there bitcoin into any sidechain they like and take it out as they see fit. If you really wanted to you could fork a sidecoin off as an alt if it ever "outgrew" bitcoin, but that seems like an extremely unlikely future.


That's like saying it seems to be only benefiting TCP/IP in the end. It should be noted that any altcoin is free to implement their own sidechain system if they want. My guess is there will be multiple types of sidechain ideas that come out of this.

To understand paper wallets, you need to understand a little bit how bitcoin works. First of all, it's important to realize that you can generate a valid bitcoin address with a computer (or piece of paper if you have a really long time) that isn't connected to the internet at all. The reason is when you pick a truly random ECDSA private key the chances that it is already used is astronomically low. So any type of randomness can be used to generate a private key for which you can be assured no one else has.
The benefit of generating a private key offline is that it reduces the ability for malicious actors to steal your private key.
So in its most basic form a paper wallet is basically a physical object with a private key/public address on it. You can send bitcoins to it, but in order to spend you would have to reimport the private key into some wallet software to sign the transaction that you want to sign (which also doesn't have to touch the internet).
The caveat is that you have now you set yourself for destruction of bitcoins by loss of the private key (or by not understanding how change addresses work). For example: House burns down, a friend finds your paper wallet, etc. There's countermeasures for all of these (backups, encrypted paper wallets, etc.)
Eventually hardware wallets will alleviate a lot (but not all) of the concerns with the use of "hot wallets."

Doctor here. So many things wrong with this on so many levels. This is a case report. Published in a journal that afaik is not very well respected in the fields of neurology or neurosciences. It's citations are poor. There's no report of eeg findings on the 4 year old. Seizures are a result of a entirely different pathophysiology from ALS. About the only thing that's the same with them is that they involve "nerves", so even if this were an effective therapy for seizure disorders it still would remain unproven for ALS.
So to summarize this is the lowest form of publishable evidence in a weak journal that says nothing about ALS. 
Speaking of which, this scalar energy stuff would be easy to design a reasonably powered double blind randomized controlled trial on. If there isn't one that has been published, it most likely means this is complete woo.

I'm not saying this is a perfect idea, but to me the implications of such a change would actually serve to off-load a lot of the blockchain bloat ... imagine a side chain that uses a simpler signature scheme than 256-bit ECDSA and disallows all but the most simple types of transactions. A iOS to Bitcoin's OS X, if you will.
I'm not sure if that's possible, but it seems to be based on my limited understanding of the system they are proposing.

Yep, we are speculating on speculation based on shaky documents in the first place. I've been try to avoid this three-ring circus, but it's just kind of fun to throw ideas out there and see what actually happens.
This is my grand unified theory:
Mark lost access to bitcoins and didn't realize it until he had to pull from cold storage after the malleability problem gummed up the hot wallets accounting. The hot wallet didn't have all it's funds stolen, just the system was really too confused to work... A rational person would say, "Well I can just fix that in the background manually, I'll just pull out some funds from the cold storage, put it in separate hot wallet with a virgin state, then I only have to fix the actually malleability accounting bug rather than reconstruct all the unspent inputs that were thought to be spent." Then when he tried to retrieve the funds (and it looks like they still have some, ~~because the old "proof" transactions from a couple years ago still have balances~~ Edit: nullc (gmaxwell) points out this is speculation as well), he realized the keys were damaged or lost. If the documents are to be believed, this is when the criminal (or immoral) behavior really began.
Alternatively, there is a investigation and gag order in place or there was soon to be and Mark actually took a lawyer's advice and has been staying quiet.
All of this is speculation... but I would prefer lost coins over stolen ones, that is for sure. The best situation would be that Gox would die by attrition after they are able to pull funds out of cold storage (somebody finds the old keys, etc.) and are able to make most of the traders whole. I really think that is remote though.

I replied in the other thread, so I won't rehash, but most bitcoin transactions are &lt; 1 kb, so a 9600 baud would be able to transmit it in &lt; 1 s. A 1200 baud would only take about 7 seconds.
For confirmation (to receive a block or operate as a SPV node), you'd probably have to use another medium.
Alternatively, you could trust the receiving packet radio operator and they could send you a signed txid back to you when it was confirmed. That would require some trust of the receiving operator though.

Well. If you look at Satoshis writings they were mostly apolitical and purposely so. Bitcoin is a tool that isn't quite done yet, and it has some use in environments that are oppressive. Its agnostic. It's like a hammer or sewing machine. Fiat money is associated with the government that backs them and all the good and bad that comes with it. 
Bitcoin in its current forum isn't great to use for laundering money. Cash sure is though. I'm not privvy to how much bitcoin is being spent on illegal goods, but even if you consider it bad I don't think you can blame the tool, you have to blame the people involved.

This question gets asked a lot. The short answer is that a transaction isn't finalized until it's included in the blockchain, but you see the transaction broadcast on the network almost immediately. It doesn't guarantee against a double spend, but for internet transactions for goods you'll be shipping it's good enough (because you'll know the transaction is valid way before shipping) and for digital goods or low-cost services then very few people would attempt a double spend in that situation.

Most countries use real-time gross settlement systems. In the US the RTGS is Fedwire (for the most part). As far as how the infrastructure is laid out, I'm not sure. I believe it's through private networks (as in airgapped from the internet) and I'm sure there's some encryption involved as well. 
Edit: A cursory search tells me they use "encryption boards" to interface with the network.

That was my immediate thought. There's something to be said about keeping the "title transference" property of the blockchain and then you would throw your coins into a zerocash side chain when you wanted to use a "purer" fungible cash system.

I don't use Coinbase.com much, but I think they pay the miner fees on your behalf from their own inputs.
So if you take the inputs and subtract the outputs, the difference is the fee (all unaccounted for inputs are fees).
It's important to note that an input has to be spent in it's entirety, so their input had 0.00077443 in it, they used 0.0002 of that to pay a fee on your behalf. They now have the change of 0.00057443 that they can use to pay somebody elses fee.

security-based swap, bond…[or] investment contract…” 15 U.S.C. § 77b. An investment

common enterprise, (3) with the expectation that profits will be derived from the efforts of the 
promoter or a third party. SEC v. W.J. Howey &amp; Co., 328 U.S. 293, 298-99 (1946); Long v. 
Shultz Cattle Co, 881 F.2d 129, 132 (1989). First, the Court must determine whether the BTCST 
investments constitute an investment of money. It is clear that Bitcoin can be used as money. It 
can be used to purchase goods or services, and as Shavers stated, used to pay for individual 
living expenses. The only limitation of Bitcoin is that it is limited to those places that accept it as 
currency. However, it can also be exchanged for conventional currencies, such as the U.S. 
dollar, Euro, Yen, and Yuan. Therefore, Bitcoin is a currency or form of money, and investors 
wishing to invest in BTCST provided an investment of money.

Just to back you up:
It's important to understand that almost every Android bitcoin client is based on his work, Coinbase (I think) uses it as a backend, Multibit, and numerous other projects use BitcoinJ. It also contains code for micropayment channels and other features that are just not present in the core client. It's also not as much of a heaping rat's nest of code, which makes it easier to learn the "details" of bitcoin than from Bitcoin Core (this is coming from someone who's more comfortable with C/C++ than Java).
I can understand why people don't like Hearn's suggestions. I don't like many of them myself (including this one), but I don't think he's trolling, disingenuous, or a secret agent of the state. He just has overtly different stated goals than many of the other users in these two projects (Tor/Bitcoin). If you've listened to Mike talk, you realize that he wants success above all else because he wants a "cool" future. Many of the other users in that group want a "free" future without sacrificing those ideals. There's more to Bitcoin and Tor than anonymity and censorship resistance. That said, I think those are integral to both projects. Hearn may have ideas that are unpopular, but I'm happy that they get brought up and debated because sometimes the wrong idea leads to the right kind of thinking when it's up for discussion or debate. If Mike was trying to sneak code in that was detrimental rather than talking about it in a open way, I would be much more concerned.

I've followed development from the very beginning, so I'm pretty satisfied that it's secure. It's damn simple and they really did think of most points of failure. The seal on the box, the open source hardware, software, deterministic signatures, ability to verify entropy. The only thing I'm worried about is some edge case USB exploit and even that seems unlikely.
It's much more secure than a web wallet, and the usability is there, too. I'm not putting all my coins on it just yet, but it's certainly the safest I've felt with my hot wallet in a while.

It really depends on how the seed is being protected and how it was originally generated. They've made it to where the generated seed uses PRNG from the device itself as well as entropy that you can contribute. They've also made it where that you can check that your contributed entropy was used when making the seed.
Now the question is how do they protect the seed? I'm not sure. I'm still looking through the code.

The others don't protect you from compromised software on online computer side as well. Imagine your computer is compromised. A sophisticated malware could replace the transaction you are wanting to be signed with a transaction outputs that go to the malware creator and you'd be none the wiser, because they also control whats displayed on the compromised computer. The Trezor has it's own display so you can check to make sure the outputs are correct. Really the transaction would also have to use the payment protocol to be really sure, since the compromised machine is probably where you got the address to send to in the first place. Still these "smart cards" systems are better than nothing, because at least it takes some interaction to send the transaction.
A display or some other form of communication is required to be really sure you're signing the transaction you think you are signing.

There's no perfect way (as there isn't any perfect way in the central system either). But a lot of the protocols break badly when you have 2 people colluding (over and above what a collusion IRL would give you). What you want is a system that makes sure that collusion only is as bad as what you would normally expect.
Edit: you can use zk-snarks and a central authority to give people access to a P2P poker game without necessarily identifying themselves, but proving they have given individualed data to someone (That proof of passport idea). A reputation system could also be used. A lot of different ways. It would be nice to keep the pot of money away from the central authority. To me there seems to be a sastifactory solution that exists, it's just not trivially in any way.

Hey guys. If you know what you're talking about please explain. If you don't please read and learn. So much upvoted FUD in this thread it's disturbing. Transaction malleability has been known about for a while, its threat has been known about and there are ways to check a transaction has been confirmed aside from a transaction ID, albeit with a little more coding effort on the part of the exchanges and shared wallet services. This is not a double spend type attack. If you know the addresses involved (which Gox should know) there should be a way to hack there code together enough so the can "confirm" that the money was sent. I'm using confirm in a different sense than what it means in the protocol. 
@_date: 2014-06-21 22:06:03
Well, by hardcore types I mean the ones that don't want to depend on a central services to tip (bitcointip fell in that, too). I have no problem with depending on changetip, as they seem to have a healthy "business" model and responsive to the community.
I've been in Bitcoin a while and I don't like people learning it's ok to leave your bitcoins out of your control. For small amounts it's fine. I wouldn't cry one bit about losing a few bucks worth of bitcoin if changetip decides to Gox us all, but it's also kind of a bad example to be setting... "Oh people leave $5 in Bitcoin in changetip, I guess it's ok to leave $5,000 in Bitstamp"
In regards to on/off-chain transactions - off chain transactions can be done as long as there some settlement procedures that happen periodically. I've a pretty long thought on this that I've been meaning to write down more formally, but I haven't had time. I think that nobodybelievesyou is at least partly right on the costs in the system as the block subsidy goes down. What I want is to keep Bitcoin about decentralized consensus because there is no other system, aside from alts, that works like it. It may very well evolve in to an "open" real time gross settlement system where large amounts are spent with rather large fees... and off-chain systems providing the brunt of the transactional load. I'm OK with that, because I don't want the ideals of the system to be terribly compromised.
I agree with you though, we are going to have to wait years to find out and I think at that point there's very high likelihood that a lot of the problems will be solved at that point. Being intellectually honest, I don't know if that's going to happen, but there's a least some twinkle of that with tree-chain/side-chain concepts that are coming out now.

I'll just start out and say I know none of these people.
You are a scumbag. That doesn't mean that Brock Pierce and his compatriots aren't scumbags as well, but you've twisted the writing of others to bring forth your pet conspiracy theory. I would normally ignore this and move on, but it involves the life of a young woman who probably was dealing with a myriad of pressures and problems. If foul play was involved, which you are not so subtly implying, then wait until you have the evidence and then take it the authorities. Anything else is just plain wrong. Reddit isn't for your morbid pet theories, and judging by your post history, they seem to be quite vibrant.
I've had a close friend commit suicide, years ago, and this really triggered my emotions on the subject. I can't imagine what somebody who was actually involved in this situation would go through... her mother? her family? her friends? It's absolutely shameful.
Do you know why Buzz Aldrin punched a conspiracy theorist in the face? Was it because he didn't go to the moon and the guy knew that? NO! It was because that guy discounted the work of tens, if not hundreds of thousands of people collectively working on a project that became a monument of human achievement. You're dishonoring the dead and hurting the living who remember her. Do you think if her family had suspected foul play they would have brought it up? If they haven't, there must be a reason... perhaps they knew what she was dealing with. That certainly seems to be the Occam's razor on this one.
Also her name was Autumn Radtke, not Radke. She wasn't one of the original "digital currency creators" as you put it. I doubt she was even alive when some of the first research on the subject came about. Chaum invented some of the first ecash systems in the early nineties and I'm pretty sure there's even earlier work in the literature.
I agree Brock might not be a good fit for the Foundation. You know how I've dealt with this: I've never joined the foundation. I've seen it as a superfluous for a very long time. I've been involved in Bitcoin &gt; 2 years. I'm a medical doctor, and not a member of the AMA either. I have freewill not to join organizations that I feel are not worth my time.

I agree with that, but in the case of the DOSer, he has no way of targetting the specific transactions that he would want respent. Additionally, if bitcoind tried to automatically rebroadcast those transactions, they would have been invalid as they were already spent and included in the blockchain (I'm speculating a little bit here - I'm not sure if bitcoind would rebroadcast in that situation). So the only way to trick Bitstamp would be the same bit of social engineering that was used on MtGox - with the difference that if you looked at the address that coins were withdrawn to, then you would see that they arrived (albeit with a different txid).


Agreed. And it seems likely that Bitstamp was using accounting books outside of what Bitcoind was telling them and when it started to fail to reconcile, they would almost immediately have known something was up. I don't know at what time the DOSer started and what time Bitstamp halted withdrawals, but that would be interesting to know. (Edit: looks like it was about 24 hours after the attack started)
Now that I think a little more about it, I think that you are right. Bitstamp may have had some coins stolen. I'll stand by my statement that the amount stolen would be much less than what happened to Gox.

If a single copy of the blockchain survived, then the network could be rebuilt.
(Alternatively, if a bunch of corrupted copies of the blockchain survived the definitive blockchain could be pieced back together... then a "fork" could be created with a lower difficulty requirement... there would be a huge economic incentive to get the transactional network working again, because the first miners would make a fortune).

Well, if you can trust that the escrow isn't colluding with either party then there are ways to set up transfer of bitcoin in such a way that the escrow holder cannot run away with the bitcoins and the coins must go to either one of the two parties. You're still trusting the escrow to make the correct judgment though.

No actually investing in a real estate company would not be the same, a more appropriate analogy would be investing in a company that researches technologies for reclaiming swamp land for use when I also own swamp land. However, even that is incomplete... giving them a portion of my swamp land so that they can use it for research to perfect their technology would be more appropriate.


I'm implying if the investment is successful. There's certainly a high risk, but any additional use-cases added to Bitcoin that are improvements of existing tech will by necessity increase the value of bitcoin. It's certainly no guarantee.


I don't believe that is the case. Gavin Andresen doesn't strike me a risk taker. I personally am not a risk taker, most of my other investments are mutual funds and I chose my job partly because of the security that I derive from it.


Straw man. I do not think of Bitcoin as a great savior. I see it as a useful technology that is not yet completely developed. It very much reminds me of early Linux. I also don't see Bitcoin as the only competitor for the space. It certainly has use-cases that make it appealing to people who are risk averse and companies like Neo&amp;Bee actually seem to want to facilitate those use cases without its users being exposed to the market volatility. There's value in this unique consensus protocol, it might not come to fruition in Bitcoin, but it will in a future technology.

So is gold. So in the past, when paper money was backed by gold, was it a commodity or a currency?
When dealing with Bitcoin you are actually dealing with an organization that is not unlike a government, only more decentralized. Bitcoin doesn't need an army, because there's no place to bomb. It has no land to defend. Bitcoin users pay a "tax" that's voluntary (but compulsory to using the system) by giving permission to the miners to print more Bitcoin in a controlled and mutually agreed upon fashion. Bitcoin is providing a ruleset for people to live by when they use system.

I have an underground bunker, that has a geiger counter that I made myself. I use it to generate true random numbers. I then seed a PRNG with multiple dice throws and XOR the results by hand with the output from my TRNG. Once I have 256 bits of data, I use that as my private key. I then take a computer that has never been online into a Faraday cage and 3 foot thick concrete walls and using SSSS I split my key into a 5-of-5 key. Using an scrypt algorithm I encrypt each of those keys based on a 10 word passphrase. I then destroy the computer and fill the underground bunker with molten metal.

One of the main dangers of having fewer nodes is the possibility of mounting a Sybil attack on targeted individuals (such as a country). Bitcoin has pretty good Sybil resistance already, but if you can completely surround a honest node with dishonest nodes you can "simulate" the network for 0-conf transactions and if you have a reasonable amount of mining power you can trick someone to use your lower difficulty blockchain. The chances of these kind of attacks are remote, but possible. The trick with Bitcoin is that a node can prove to itself that all surround nodes are lying to it if it can just connect to one honest node. So a good number of healthy nodes makes Sybils exceedingly difficult for an attacker to pull off.

We use words to express meaning, and if those words cannot be used to express an idea sufficiently then it's a failure of those words, not a failure of the idea. We start to get caught in arguments of syntax/semiotics. Money and currency clearly have ambiguous definitions, so much so that lawyers/regulators/economists are coming together to try to iron out what Bitcoin is. It's their definitions that are failing. Pick any category that you wish to put Bitcoin in and I'll give you a reason it belongs and doesn't belong in that category. The only category that it fits in is "cryptocurrency" because it's a coined term specifically to describe it.

Here's a free business idea for you. The thing about micropayments is that people make a lot of them. Buy a few minutes of WiFi here, play an arcade game there, few minutes of parking, etc. Each of those examples costs a few to tens of cents and the associated Bitcoin transaction fee would be too high to make them viable. Well imagine a company called Microtransactosoft and they serve as an intermediary for these types of transactions. Every day or week a person sets up a payment channel with Microtransactosoft with a predetermined amount they would want to spend in that week. They go through there day zapping their phone towards little things they want or need and that payment channel gets slowly depleted over the week. Microtransactosoft waits until the aggregate amounts associated with the wifi provider or the parking provider goes over a certain threshold and then they shoot them a non-micro transaction sized amount. This can happen even before the channels have been closed (as long as they have enough liquid bitcoin).
Edit: There's also other off-chain and on-chain solutions which require less or more trust in more centralized bodies.

It used to be harder to get fiat transfers out of Gox, but possible after long wait times. It was also fairly easy to get BTC out, then when they froze BTC withdrawals and people realized what was going on, they exchanged their BTC for fiat (because panic), driving the market price downwards. It's going to be an interesting (high volume) time when (and if) Gox resumes BTC withdrawals.

If I have a 100 oz of gold and make paper money backed by that, and on that paper money I write, "one ounce payable to the bearer on demand" in what way is that not a commodity? There can only be 100 notes. Unless, of course, I don't own that gold and can't pay the bearer on demand. It's possible also that the treasury of a government in that situation could have excess gold as well, but a controlled release of notes with an upward bound would still fit the definition of a commodity.
It does have stabilizing forces that are decentralized. The feedback loops are there, mining difficulty for example as well as the market forces of getting a transaction into a block, etc. It's still quite experimental, and it isn't going to be stable for a long time (if ever). Just because there isn't a guy at the top guiding economic policy doesn't mean there isn't a policy in place, though.
I don't know why I'm arguing about this, I don't believe Bitcoin is a currency in the traditional sense either. It's a distributed asset ledger, and that in and of itself has value, even if the unit of account can't be used as a currency. And I agree there is a huge speculative component to Bitcoin.

Well, in that case the implementation of side-chains (or tree-chains) if only to support private-chains (or fidelity bonded ledgers) is worthwhile. If I understand correctly, it takes away seigniorage from the entity, but allows for some of the other benefits of using a trusted entity (mainly scalability).
Regarding the dangers of merge-mined side chains, I saw an idea bandied about using zkSNARKs to bolster the security model. I didn't get into the idea too much, since the math is beyond me, but it didn't seem to be such a bad idea. And I also confess I haven't gotten into the nuts-and-bolts of tree-chains to make an informed decision about which is better. ;)

Bitcoin is useful for getting money to aid organizations, I don't deny that. It's useful for anyone to give aid, but the conversion to fiat currency that may or may not collapse completely after the conflict is over is the pitfall. After WWI, countries that were hit hard converted to a barter system that revolved around commodity moneys because the fiat money that they had was worth very little. [Source]( 
As the value of the currency begins to collapse, you'll end up in a situation where no one will be willing to trade BTC for the collapsing fiat, and at that point the people with the BTC should only be willing to trade for other commodities. BTC could be used as a life preserver until a new fiat is created.

This will be more like ELI20:
When you spend bitcoins, a transaction is made of inputs and outputs. Inputs can be ordered in any way when spending your bitcoins, even after the transaction has been signed... the problem is that when you reorder the inputs (or change them in very specific ways that don't effect the information contained in them), then you change a value that is used to identify that transaction (called a transaction id - should really be called a hash). When a transaction is finally included in a block that "transaction id" is finalized, but it could be very different from the one that you actually expect to have appeared in the blockchain.

Stefan Molyneax is generally a good guy, but his history is off in this case. It really began to happen with the publication of the Flexner report in 1910 which caused the number of medical schools to dwindle.
Before the flexner report, there were 151 medical schools, most were shut down shortly thereafter (many rightfully so... many didn't not have appropriate cadaver labs and didn't teach modern medicine well enough to teach physicians to practice). This limited the number of graduates, but the quality of the graduates increased dramatically. Over the last 100 years, life expectancy has increased 10-20 years (albeit most of that due to the invention of vaccines and access to clean water).
I'd be happy to charge a fair price for my services, but again, the government makes it illegal for me to do so and the regulatory burden is so high it is impossible to go it alone unless you have enough starting capital (which I don't have). I want to charge a pt. $20 bucks if that's all they can afford, but I can't... it's illegal, I'll be put in prison and fined if I did (this only applies because I work in a hospital that accepts Medicare).
The sad part is I agree with you. The AMA and the government have continually screwed the economic incentives in system to the point where it's so perverse nothing can be done about it except wait for the inevitable collapse and then fix it. A lot of docs sold themselves out in the 1960-70s when Medicare came about (it used to be that Medicare actually paid more than private insurance), but I and many of the physicians like me can't be held responsible for something we weren't even involved in. I want smaller government. I want smaller regulatory burden. I want more residency positions and med school positions... but it won't happen. It's hopelessly broken.
I feel I get paid fairly (perhaps more than fairly as you point out others are suffering - but really they are the ones that should be brought up to my standard of living), but the enemies are not the docs. Our lobby is so much smaller than the drug companies, the insurance companies, the device manufacturers, the hospital lobbies... by orders of magnitude. I'm not complaining about my wage at all, it's just you're going after the wrong throats in the system... we are here to save lives. I have no idea how much the hospital charges a patient (no one does), but I do know that my bill is at least a tenth of it.
A cholecystectomy (gall bladder removal) costs $25,000 in the united states. Do you know how much the doctor gets paid for that? ~$700. A liter of saline (1 liter water + 9 grams of salt in a plastic bag) costs the consumer $137.

You only know the single address that you sent your bitcoins to is owned by Gox, any other address after that could be owned by Gox or another trader (or hacker/inside-job/etc.). I'll say it again, a single hop out of an address that is known to be owned by Gox means nothing about who owns those coins... unless you can find proof that Gox owns that next address, then it's just speculation at that point (and it doesn't make one theory of what gox screwed up more likely than another).
The type of analysis needed that would be any help whatsoever would be to figure out the automated mechanisms that Gox used to shuffle around Bitcoins (how it got from deposits from withdrawals). That will take much more sophisticated analysis than a spreadsheet. It's reverse engineering of (probably) poorly written code. After you figure out how their system was designed to behave, then and only then, could you start to look for aberrant behavior. After you figure out the aberrant behavior (e.g. This is how Gox usually acted with this kind of deposit and withdrawal... but something is different here) then you might be able to figure out something. My guess is it's a game of incomplete information... we simply don't know enough about all the external variables to really make the analysis useful. I could be wrong though.
You can think of Gox as a [black box]( inside another black box. The first step is to separate the two from each other, then you *might* be able to figure something out.

Best way to do it is to scan BIP32 and come back with questions. It's pretty technical, but if you can glean a bit from it, it's easier to ask the right questions.
The gist of it is you can have a public "master" key that can be used to derive future public addresses without needing to store the corresponding private keys on a server  because a corresponding "master" private key can used to derive future private keys that correspond to those public addresses.

Right now we have laws enforcing contracts... if I break my contract, you go to the police or a lawyer. I get arrested or sued. I appear before a judge or settle... I get thrown in prison or I pay a fine. With cryptography enforced contracts, If I don't fulfill the contract, then I lose what the contract tells me I lose... you win a judgment of crypto-law which is handled a bit more swiftly than the traditional system. It's essentially an agreement of arbitration.
While I don't follow that all societal agreements can use cryptographic enforcement rather than a traditional legal system, there are certainly some systems that can (and should) use "crypto-law" over the traditional legal system.

I think it's likely that Karpeles used his own ideas to implement his version of cold storage. The good (and bad) news is that his own implementation of a m-of-n scheme to cold store bitcoin is a very crappy imitation of a Shamir's Secret Sharing Scheme. Bad because it would take a while to reverse engineer, good because his implementation would make it possible to brute force within a reasonable amount of time. (In SSSS, if you need 9 of 10 keys, you really do need all 9 of them, having 8 will not allow you to "break" it. In Karpeles's scheme it if you need 9 of 10 keys, but only have 8, you'll be able to bruteforce crack the 9th with some time).

It's an unfortunate lesson, but a necessary one apparently. I just wish people started to learn from other people's mistakes and learn not to repeat them.
People store their money in Coinbase are asking for the hurt, too. I trust Coinbase, I don't think a security failure of their's will cause people to lose their bitcoin, but legal troubles and financial troubles could, even with how well funded they are. Multisig systems/hardware wallets are the minimum necessary infrastructure needed for me to get my family involve in any cryptocurrency. The security barriers and the *requirement* to understand cryptography/digital signatures is too high of a learning curve currently. That's why I avoid trying to get new merchants and users involved. I don't want people to get hurt and their money stolen or lost. That's a good way to lose a new user forever. They don't understand what went wrong, and because of that they won't be able to make a distinction of Bitcoin from (Mtgox, inputs.io, mybitcoin, instawallet, etc.).

A ECDSA private key can derive a public key and the corresponding public address. 


If you really think this is an original thought on how to "mark" addresses, you're delusional. People have been doing this from very early on.


This really isn't true. The balance "in" a bitcoin address is the sum of the unspent outputs associated with that address. When you "send" bitcoins, you broadcast a message using those unspent outputs as inputs in that new transaction. Once that's included in a block, the sum of your unspent outputs in your wallet is your new balance. It's a technical difference, but when speaking about blockchain "analysis" and then making that kind of error doesn't lend you any credence.
Additionally, at least one of those large balance addresses has a spend from gmaxwell's - "taint analysis disruption." Something that was deliberately designed to make your kind of analysis even more ridiculous.

Also please note that ALL wallets have bugs in them. However, all good wallets are open source and most developers will welcome bug reports if they are brought up in the right fashion.

There's a big problem with a proof-of-stake when it's not also combined with a proof-of-work system. POS alone does not provide adequate motivation to form around a single consensus chain (in the face of malicious miners).

It's probably easier to ask which program you normally use first, because the answer depends on it.
There's a interesting thing about spending bitcoins from paper wallets that it's important to be aware of: change addresses. When you import a private key and spend from a address... the bitcoin protocol requires all bitcoins from that address are spent. So, if you have an address with 3 BTC and you spend 1 BTC to a merchant then the other 2 BTC are spent to another address as "change." Many clients send the "change" back to the same address they were spent from, but others, like bitcoin-qt, send the change to a third address... meaning that the paper wallet will no longer contain those bitcoins. Many people have lost coins because they didn't realize this.

I would suggest requiring companies that move funds around in their wallet to use a deterministic wallet structure (as outlined in [BIP32]( They can share the public parent key with the auditor which would provide the auditor reasonable assurance that they own all future addresses that are used within their wallet software. To add further assurance, your audit process could request signature from a random child address which would prove that they have access to the private child key derivation function (just at that time though).

He probably started out not being malicious, and had good intentions. I think he made enough technical errors and slowly his good intentions faded and was replaced with "keep this thing going at all costs." The question is when that occurred... I think its possible that it happened at the point of the transaction malleability fiasco. It's the old "If you don't test your backups, you don't have backups" thing. He did keep the thing going for a while after that... I think he was trying to recover the keys. We know they eventually "recovered" 200k worth.

It's very unlikely that Bitstamp was stolen from. They use Bitcoind... so their transactions would go through when broadcasted and when a mutated transaction did get included in the blockchain, it would just mess up bitstamp's wallet if it tried to spend change to self that hadn't been confirmed... this would create invalid transactions (that couldn't be modified to be spent) and/or the wrong balance to appear in their wallet. Only if the manually sent out new transactions with different unspent inputs would they have lost bitcoins.
Quite a bit different case than what happened to Gox.

To me, it breaks bitcoin on a fundamental level... the fix seems worse than the problem and I certainly hope the majority of miners wouldn't even think of doing it. I feel sorry for those that lost their funds, but even in the situation where the coins ended up in the hands of a thief, it would undermine trust in the system as a whole.

Point is that these quotes have to be put in context of the discussion. Without that context (and chronology), it means less than nothing since he can be used to deliberately mislead. 
I think it's also important to give Satoshi credit for being the creator of the system while at the same time recognizing that he didn't have all the answers or know the future challenges that would crop up. Additionally, this quote you cite is before he committed the blocksize softfork. Satoshi actually changed his opinion on quite a few things as the system progressed. 
The fact that Satoshi designed the system in a way where he couldn't  (and shouldn't) control it seems to be lost on many people.

If you make a side-chain that isn't merge-mined you have to make it economical to the miners to want to devote hashpower that they would use elsewhere (rather than piggy backing on Bitcoin's hashrate). So a scrypt sidechain would only be mined if the miners found it more valuable to mine than altcoins. This is a bit different situation than the coinbase rewards halving every 4 years in bitcoin. I'm having trouble putting it into words though. The idea if there is a feed-back loop in play between how much hashpower is on the network and the value of that network. With a side-chain, the value is locked to the Bitcoin network's value, and therefore it makes little sense to use processing power you could devote elsewhere on a side-chain (unless the fees were high enough to support it). There are a lot of variables here, but it seems like merge-mining is the most viable option.

When you get down to quantum mechanics, probability is reality. We don't have people randomly turning into ferrets... although there is a non-zero probability that it could happen.

As I said, it's predicated on a security failure not occurring in the side-chain. Namecoin's hashrate is 71% of Bitcoins currently, so the majority of miners are willing to merge-mine at least one coin. The sticking point that's being teased out in this conversation is how to incentivize Bitcoin miners to merge-mine the proposed sidechain. As a sidechain becomes less popular, it would be vulnerable, but it'll be softer death than when an altcoin falls on its face (Bitcoin will leak out of the sidechain P2SH address as the popularity and hashrate of that sidechain dwindles). Remember merge mining doesn't require a whole lot more resources to perform, unlike an entirely new altcoin - which would require dedicated resources.
I'd think that the sidechain units will likely always be slightly less valuable than the suspended Bitcoin, but not by very much. This isn't like a proof-of-burn with a time-limit to get your new shiny altcoins, you have the option from here to eternity to move your bitcoin into a specific sidechain (and to move them out if you follow the rules of that sidechain).
@_date: 2014-09-05 18:36:00
Well, my proposal is trust minimizing, too. If Microtransactosoft starts behaving badly, you have the ability to cut off the payment channel at any point. Then the companies screwed by Microtransactosoft also have a single target to go after, so it's pretty much a win-win. There's other methods that could minimize trust even further, but they are significantly more complicated to explain. You could even have microtrasactosoft open up micropayment channels with the third parties and pay them as they go (aggregate multiple customer payments into a single channel).
Edit: I was expecting a troll to bring up that point, so I didn't just unload the entirety of the idea in one post. ;)

Because any rational developer that decides to implement an actual improved featureset in their altcoin will inevitably be competing against the sidecoin version of their own idea. The sidecoin version will have these additional properties:
* If the sidecoin fails in any way besides an outright security failure, you get your bitcoins back.
* If mining pools have an automated merge-mining system in place, then sidecoin version will instantly have more hashrate securing it than the altcoin.
* Your idea (as a traditional altcoin) will instantly have less credibility... it will be consider the near equivalent of premining.
* There's very little liquidity in the alt-to-fiat markets... a (two-way pegged) sidecoin system will be fungible with bitcoin, meaning you can cash out your sidecoins without causing nearly as significant market shocks.
Edit: I will say I don't think this will kill the altcoin markets, but it will limit their usefulness as testbeds and lower their credibility overall and that to me means their marketshare of cryptocurrencies will dwindle as a whole.
@_date: 2014-04-10 17:38:52
No downvote from me, just a few comments :) I think these are good discussions to have.


Any open source altcoin will almost immediately be implementable as a sidechain. If an use-case can be cannibalized from an altcoin (such as zerocoin's anonymity) then the sidechain will almost always be the rational choice.


There's no security guarantees against a 51% attack on Bitcoin either, but Merge-mining is significantly less resource intensive than bootstrapping a new alt with different mining infrastructure.


The cost will be the same, the benefit of using a sidechain over a similar alt will be much greater (provided bitcoin remains the dominant cryptocurrency).

Blockchain.info doesn't technically have a hot wallet holding user funds. They store encrypted copies of keys that is sent to you and is decrypted by your browser client side.

It's true. There's a proof that the Generals' Problem is unsolvable. Bitcoin doesn't magically solve the unsolvable though, it only does so under certain modifications to the original problem. Bitcoin is Byzantine Fault Tolerant, it isn't a perfect solution (as none exists) but provides a reasonable assurance that a consensus exists.
Now the knowledge that no perfect solution of the Generals problem existed may have kept others from pursuing a decentralized solution, Satoshi wasn't the only one that had some practicable ideas and there are other distributed consensus algorithms that exists which are BFT.

I know my friend repurposed all his cards that he was using to mine Bitcoin to mining altcoins months ago.

Really the equivalent case would be if you parked your unregistered vehicle under a sign that said "free car," had the keys in the ignition, windows rolled down, with a fresh tank of gas. The theft was absolutely inevitable. Not only that, there is no good way for you to contact the owner of the address to let them know it is compromised. The only way to give the owner any chance of keeping their Bitcoins is to move them and get the owners attention and then confirm they own the private keys of an associated (uncompromised) address.
btcrobinhood isn't the only one that knows about this vulnerability. It's been known about for months. He's certainly not the only one iterating over low entropy private keys. He's likely one of the few that would return the coins to their rightful owner (and to a secure address).

Satoshi Nakamoto is a pseudonym for the person or persons that created Bitcoin. Bitcoin is a system based on distributing computing. This requires all users in the system to behave by the rules, including it's creator. If you don't behave by the rules, you are simply ignored. The rules are laid out for all that have the ability to read them. No one can just create new bitcoins, they have to either buy them, get paid in them, or "mine" them. Satoshi probably has close to a million Bitcoins, but he mined them... he didn't just give himself them. Another interesting thing is almost all of the Bitcoins he produced have never been spent.

I love the dynamic discussion between Peter and Gavin. It's a little strained, but there's a lot being sussed out.
I think it's important that the "no right answer" that Gavin keeps referring is completely true and a point that's often missed by people that think a little more concretely. This is software... it's a little more rigid because the need for a network consensus, but in the end it's much more flexible than anything else that has existed before. I'm no Keynesian, but I think there's room for debt based system like ripple and a "hard asset" system like Bitcoin with varying degrees of privacy, transaction clearing times, and decentralization. 
I also think offering the script codes necessary to implement Tree and Side-chains is important. I think Adam Back actually mentioned that a side-chain wouldn't necessarily require a merge mined system to maintain consensus and that other more centralized solutions could be allowed, too. As long as the redemption of coins from the side chain back to Bitcoin could not be blocked by that party, then using a centrally cleared sidechain could essentially provide for a low cost solution for coffee purchases that wouldn't overly tax the network. I'm not sure if that would be possible, but it certainly sounds like it might be implementable... that type of innovation without permission is critical to eventual improvement of the digital currency space and what separates it from the legacy systems.

I agree, but even if it's a true bug, this is not the right place for it. Reddit often gets the pitchforks ready and then asks questions later. The multibit devs are a valuable resource for the future improvement of the Bitcoin ecosystem. I've seen more than one dev in other open source projects just say "fuck it" when people get all pitchforky about an issue.
I'm not saying that issues shouldn't be brought up and debated, but reddit is most certainly not the most productive avenue. In this situation, I would use it as a last resort if I thought the bug was critical (people at risk of losing their bitcoins) and the devs were completely unresponsive to private contact as well as github issues.

The short answer is the exchange are not liquid. They aren't providing the ability to withdraw or deposit fast enough to take advantage of the different market prices. (Gox has withdrawal problems on both the bitcoin and fiat side).
So in order to effective arbitrage you would have to have large holdings of bitcoins and fiat on separate exchanges and you would have to be able to trust the exchanges enough to have those holdings remain there.

My theory: People don't like it when they are wrong about something. They really don't like it when they are wrong about something that involves money (or politics or religion). Bitcoin has a lot of the same red-flags MLM/Pyramid/Ponzi schemes have and it sets off people's BS detector when they first hear about it. It sure did mine. I wrote it off in 2009-10 because I knew about previous digital cash systems that had failed (egold/digicash/etc.). It wasn't until I saw it again after the 2011 bubble that I really delved into it (Why would it crash after the first bubble, but still have some value?) So I looked a little bit more into it, and it took months for me to actually decide it was good idea. I'm still not 100% sure on it.
So back to the question. The hatred almost always corresponds with the News cycle. It's hard to determine motivations, but some could be price manipulation and some could have talked themselves out buying in previously. 
It's also a huge trolling target... nothing gets under people more than trolling people about their money (or politics or religion).
Additionally the community around bitcoin was and is filled with some very interesting personalities that can be off-putting to some.
Really there's too many reasons to list, but I like having the discussion.

I'll explain a little more thoroughly since you tipped me. A digital signature provides a way to verify a message against a public key, proving that whoever created that message has access to the corresponding private key. It also proves that the message was not corrupted in anyway. Changing the message contents (plaintext) in any way will invalidate the signature. So I could type: "Pet the bunny." and sign it. If "Eve" (the universal crypto bad-guy) caught the message before you had a chance to receive it, she could change the message to "Kill the bunny," but she couldn't forge the digital signature. So as long as you "know" what my public key is, it would be impossible to forge.
This is a good intro video on public key crypto. It doesn't directly deal with digital signatures, but it's incredibly informative so I always link to it when people ask these kinds of questions:

Even in the case of P2pool it would not be desirable if a majority were using it to mine with. It's just something that is inherent in the underlying design of Bitcoin.

Ideally mining would start to coalesce in locations with cheap excess nonexportable electricity exists +/- in places where waste heat is desirable. Who knows what will happen...

As I understand it, in the usual circumstances, the side-chain coins can't go to zero in value, that's the point of the two-way peg. The reason I say usual circumstances is because I think that would be predicated that a security failure did not cause the sidecoin to lose it's value. In the situation where the coins have had control lost of them, they stay suspended just like you lost your private keys. Again, I'm just starting to put these ideas together, but based on what I've read that seems to be a pretty safe assumption.

Well, considering the work is mostly theirs and the commits somehow achieved a ~600% increase in validation speed over what Hal Finney left, I'm led to believe those commits weren't all that superfluous.

Yes on both questions. You can also make a paper wallet use a Hierarchical deterministic structure (a key that corresponds to a nearly infinite number of private keys) and/or encrypted (a paperwallet that requires a passphrase to decrypt before it can be reimported [so a friend would need the paper wallet and your passphrase] - see BIP38).

If they elect to tax bitcoin as capital gains, and bitcoin crashes and burns, people will have quite a bit to write off (but not really all that much in the grand scheme of things). However, if the value increases, then they stand to have quite a bit of tax revenue from treating it like capital gains. It's bizarre that IRS hasn't issued a ruling even though they been in that process since before the congressional hearings on Bitcoin (as mentioned by the FinCEN's director Shasky).

It depends how the pool is implemented. With the most used protocol (stratum), the pool's miners have no idea what set of transactions they are throwing their computational weight behind... only the pool operator does.
There's a separate problem in this, which I think is much worse. A pool with &gt;50% hashrate will wilt away as the market responds to double-spends/reorganization attacks (even really stupid miners will get a clue when their mined commodity is worth 10% of what it was). However if the pool actually is a single miner operation that owns the hashrate, it turns into a bigger problem. The problem is you *can't* tell which is which easily. It seems apparent that GHash.io/Cex actually own a lot of the hashrate pointed towards their pool, and they've financed themselves with other people's less-than-wisely spent money. They've essentially built themselves a commodity hashrate pyramid scheme and for some reason people have been falling for it.
Yifu Gao (of Avalon infamy) told a story where he was literally holding enough chips to attack the network... so in a way today's ecosystem is marginally better than it was when ASICs first came about.
I'd like to see a new innovation to bolster proof-of-work and further disincentivise centralization. If that requires some protocol level changes, then so be it. The problem is that many of the suggested solutions are ugly and probably don't even work that well. I also think that Gavin's thinking of a ASIC space heaters may actually happen. We are looking at this complex system at a single point in time, where it's not in a steady state (Bitcoin ASIC development hasn't quite caught up with Intel-quality foundaries) and predicting where it's going (centralization vs decentralization) by how the pendulum is currently swinging. There's a number of forces that want to push the equilibrium of mining towards decentralization (waste heat being one of them). We can try to influence that setpoint by further changing incentives, but those changes come with a non-zero cost of initializing them. To date, there seems to be a lot of really bad solutions and a couple of OK but not great solutions. Personally I think a better solution is probably going to come up, but it's likely going to involve some really non-obvious, complicated cryptography that is going to require a lot of vetting before implementation.

To me it's more interesting that volatility in itself is quite volatile. Differing by a factor of 10-100 over the course of a month. I think it demonstrates how external events affect the bitcoin price, as I could match up news (good and bad) to those changes in price. It also demonstrates that much of the value of bitcoin is speculative in nature. More mature use-cases which fulfill the speculative wishes of bitcoin holders will more likely decrease volatility than the "market cap" (or rather unit/monetary base).

Completely agree. It's the way it should be done. I was trying to make a list of things that shouldn't be done. My advice is like the view from 10,000 ft.


I won't back away from this one. There's a real chance that you'll render your bitcoins inaccessible (destroyed) unless you really know what you are doing. I use paperwallets, but they aren't for beginners. HD paper wallets using Armory/Electrum are excellent, but that distinction is often not made. Paper wallets that consist of a single private key are dangerous if you don't know how to use them. It's just not for beginners. The learning curve is high. Perhaps using the word "expert" isn't right, perhaps "power user" would be more appropriate.


To me brainwallet means a wallet using entropy generated from your brain. Perhaps I'm in the minority on this, but I don't consider electrum seeds (which are excellent) to be brainwallets. I guess I watched the evolution of what people considered a brainwallet (basically a phrase that was hashed and used as the private key) clouds what I consider to be a "brainwallet."
Edit: What you've done is made my point. The proper security procedures to store bitcoins safely is out of reach for the majority of people now. It won't always be like that, but for now... I don't tell my parents to buy bitcoin, I don't tell my colleagues to buy bitcoin, etc. Not because I don't believe in the technology... I love it, but it's ARPAnet not the internet, it's a MUD not WoW, it's a model T not a tesla. I have two friends that I've really discussed it with because I know they have the technical expertise to understand it (and use it safely).
@_date: 2014-02-25 19:01:44
People that have balances of bitcoins stored at Coinbase have Coinbase as a counterparty risk, which makes solvency an issue. Coinbase would be in an easier position of proving solvency because they don't hold consumer bitcoin balances as fiat (or at least it appears they don't).
Edit: It appears we are talking past each other, I mean actual cryptographic proofs of solvency (or as close as  is reasonably possible), not just statements from prominent individuals in the community. See: Yao's Millionaire Problem as an example of what I mean (but not exactly).
@_date: 2014-08-18 21:29:05
Certainly true. Docs on a whole are probably less security conscious, but I think that should be changing as the old guard ages out. Still simple things like a yubikey could help significantly. It's the adage that people understand physical security pretty well, but digital security is foreign to them.
@_date: 2014-02-13 22:47:19
I think merchant acceptance is great thing, but I don't see it moving markets upward (aside from the initial PR boost). I see it as necessary, but not sufficient. Bitcoin's monetary base has a lot baked into its price, but speculation on its future is still a huge amount of that base. It's hard to decide how flighty the speculatory portion of the base is, but judging on previous bubbles, it can be pretty significant.
As an investment, I would not recommend Bitcoin to my family - the learning curve is too high right now to make the safe/technical decisions in order to secure bitcoins properly (even though I think the price will eventually be higher than it is now). As a technical/educational experiment, Bitcoin has been one of the greatest experiences I've had. When (and if) it's ready for prime time - I'll have a nice little gift to give people that I care about.

Satoshi has many addresses... it's not exactly clear which one's Satoshi mined, but we have a fairly good idea. Many of the first blocks in the system were probably mined by Satoshi and most of those initial blocks "coinbase" transactions (the reward for mining a block) have never been spent.

You don't open a channel to pay one person on the LN. You open multiple channels to connect to the LN which has connections to (almost) everyone else. You're thinking about payment channels alone. Payment channel:LN :: ethernet crossover cable:the internet. 
With current script available you can open a channel and extend it as long as you'd like. You can shorten it as well, one way with cooperation and another after a prespecified timeout.

Dollar cost averaging... it's a investment strategy meant to insulate from the shock of a volatile market. It's criticized because it doesn't provide a maximum return for investment (e.g. better to put as much as your willing to invest right in the beginning). The idea is that you set aside a amount that you want to buy (in fiat) and buy in regular intervals. The advantage is almost purely psychological.

If you actually look at how it's implemented, it's a blocksize increase where newer nodes serve a block absent the signatures of segwit transactions to old nodes. Old nodes will recognize they aren't getting the full picture and alert that node owner that there's new rules they are unable to interpret which seem to be in place, which has been that case for a while now for any softfork. Additionally old nodes will not relay or mine new segwit transactions (they can't). If a segwit node tried to serve a segwit block en toto to a old node, that old node would not know what to do other than disconnect the segwit node and ban it.
To new nodes, segwit is absolutely an increase. The reason the word "effective" was used was because the increase to X (whether it be 1.7-2.1-4) is variable based on the transaction mix. Unfortunately, people grabbed onto the "effective" word and thought it was an antonym to "actual". It's an actual increase, but we don't know by byte count what it will be block by block.

So a wallet contains a collection of public address (or a single address in some simpler clients) - When you sign a transaction with your private key to be broadcast to the network, that transaction also has your public key so the network can confirm the hash of that public key corresponds to that public address. (If this is all gobbledygook don't sweat it, I can explain simpler if needed). 
So in your example if you have coins from Address A sent to Address B and C the only one with an exposed public key would be address A. 
Spending from an address exposes the public key, but you would still have to figure out what the corresponding private key would be to that public key if you wanted to "hack" a bitcoin address. As far as we know, this is ridiculously unlikely to happen using a traditional computer.

Yes, but that wasn't what DarkEmi wrote. Of course malleability can be fixed with a softfork otherwise segwit couldn't exist as a softfork as well. DarkEmi didn't mention adding a new sighash type, just separating as part of hard fork (presumably for all transaction types).
Before segwit, sipa had a BIP that also could have implemented as a softfork (or multiple) to fix malleability, but withdrew because he felt segwit was a superior solution. I think all the lightning developers were happy that segwit was a good solution. I think tdryja said he had a few nits, though.

Shamir's secret sharing scheme... it's the correct way of splitting keys up into parts to be reassembled later. See here: 
A hierarchical deterministic wallet is a wallet that has a public key derivation function and private key derivation function. You can store the public key derivation function anywhere, and if it's compromised the only thing the attacker will be able to do is know what addresses you own. Brainwallet.org offers the ability to create deterministic wallets:  (run offline - I'd generate with dice throws or other random source if you're really paranoid) ... Electrum and Armory both use deterministic wallets as well. There's a standardization that is going on with them now (BIP32).
Edit: Also multibit HD, when it's released, will use a HD wallet structure as well.

Whenever they would need the capital to make a non lightning transaction OR when channels need to be rebalanced significantly. 
I think it's important to point out that LN transactions will initially only make sense for micro style payments (think cents to a few dollars). The usefulness of the network goes up as the exchange rate per bitcoin goes up. There's some interesting macroeconomic questions that I don't think we will know the answer to until a network is live on a coin that has a real exchange rate.

The blockchain is a collection of transactions that have been built on top of eachother systematically in a way that if you tried to make a modification to any one of the transactions in the blockchain it would become invalid. It's a secure ledgerbook, and if you want more detail I can go into it.
The problem with a ledger, is in the past, there would be somebody in charge of it... and if that person lost the book, people would be screwed, if he decided to change entries (embezzle), people would be screwed, or if he just decided to make arbitrary changes to how the system worked, people could be screwed. 
The blockchain is built in such a way that you have to perform "work" in order to put a new group of entries into the ledger. You are awarded for your efforts because you get to add an entry yourself that gives you a little for performing that work. This distributes the power to the miners and users, because they can all verify that the entries were made "fairly."
A transaction is processed like so: A person announces a valid transaction with valid digital signature... the network hears it and includes it in a pool of transactions to be included in a future block. When the miner finds block (with that transaction built in) they announce it to the rest of network, who then verifies it and starts to build on top of it.
It's kind of complicated, you'll have to learn about 3 different ways how it works before you really "start" to get it.

Sorry, but I cannot support that type of top-down, centrally-planned vision.
Edit: Sorry, I'm snarky about this, but this is rhetoric (Similar to fire the devs comment). Gavin wants to fix the 1 MB problem and introduce another limit to make it safe, which I'm actually perfectly OK with. I think Segwit is a better way to fix the problem since it fixes the problem in what I would consider a cleaner way. Reasonable people disagree, though.

The more I've looked into it, the more I'm convinced that it really did come from a brilliant individual (or group &lt; 3 or 4). The code from the original "bitcoin" was not really that long. There were 10 cpp files (main.cpp was 2660 lines). It was also pretty consistently written, style-wise. So the project size was well within an individuals ability.

If the user doesn't control their bitcoin address, it wouldn't matter anyway. Signing from an address you control that you've previously sent coins to Gox from would at least prove that you control the address. There's still some problems (sending coins directly from your mining pool, for example) with using it, but that may be a start.

The IRS has not issued any guidelines about how Bitcoin should be treated under tax law. Most people are assuming that it will fall under a capital gains tax, meaning you don't pay taxes until you realize that gain. Alternatively, treating it like a currency would mean that you would pay your tax based on the income, but as the value increased you wouldn't be any more liable to pay taxes on those gains. If the IRS elects to tax Bitcoin as a capital gain they would be essentially speculating that Bitcoin will be rising in value in the future as they will want to maximize their tax revenue. It also makes the most sense because most people don't earn their income in Bitcoin, they are merely exchange their income into Bitcoin.

It's possible that he used the same keys since the format is the same (other than the L and the 1) but I think that's unlikely. Best way to do it would be to update to the latest litecoin node (sync will be much faster) and/or use the command line to export the private keys and import them into something like electrum  (or wait until the node syncs). You can export the private keys before a sync is done. Be sure to back up the wallet file before doing anything.

The author of that article can't read the research cited. It states 


For bitcoin, the ideal would be 100% of addresses should have balances never spent from based on how change transactions are supposed to be handled, a point that Shamir et al. gloss over as well in their paper.
Same paper 


They go on to say that it's likely because of SatoshiDice, but that doesn't change fact that coins that aren't in motion have little to do with liquid economy that is above it.
Hoarding might cause volatility, and that is an undesirable property for a currency (I'd argue Bitcoin isn't a currency and it's a bit unfortunate that it has been labeled that), but it's not something that can really be fixed without a central controller (even with a central control it doesn't seem like it would achieve a steady state). In the future, a cryptocurrency that can respond to external variables (other than computational difficulty) may be possible, but I would posit we simply don't know enough about how to spur more positive outcomes. Let's wait for Bitcoin to fail and then we can figure out what went wrong and fix it.

I think Luke is being overly cautious, but the problem is that it's one of those "activation energy" problems that you see in chemistry. If it gets to the point it's bad, then it will almost certainly get worse quickly. The good news is much of miner's costs are already sunk in hardware costs, so I don't think a 50% hashrate drop is likely to happen. Doesn't mean we shouldn't be ready for it.

I actually think I agreed about 80% of time with her. Her area of expertise is certainly economics. I heard her say something to the effect "the market will work it out" a few times when they suggested banning or regulating how Bitcoin could be used and about how much risk is priced into the system. The guy on the far left I disagreed with at almost every point because I believe the consensus and voluntary use of bitcoin as a protocol that is an inherent asset, rather than a liability. He made multiple arguments that could be boiled down by stating that currency is our "lifeblood" and it had to be managed in a way that is centrally controlled. He may not have any ownership of Bitcoin, but I'm sure he's well vested in USD.
Edit: What I don't think I agree with her, and I actually think it's possible she's being deliberately disingenuous about, was regulating "one hop" into the Bitcoin network. I think she has knowledge that we have the cryptographic tools to make even that kind of thing unenforceable in another cryptocurrency (Coinjoin, tumblers, stealth addresses, and other Zero Knowledge proofs of knowledge). If they overregulate Bitcoin, they will just push users into a more private/anonymous form. Anything that attacks the fungibility or privacy of bitcoin will be routed around, just as any well developed network interprets censorship as damage to route around. She even mentions the possibility that that onerous regulation could push the users of cryptocurrencies to apply more resources to implementing those things quicker.

Almost all software that interacts with Bitcoin transactions beyond the most basic of functions would have to be rewritten. This would include light wallets, exchange software, mining software, block explorers, and pretty much any bitcoin app. It would probably render unspendable at least some coins as well (though you could probably figure out how to fix that with the same hardfork).

Ideally your source of entropy wouldn't come from a computer (or you XOR'd the PRNG against another source of entropy).
That's my point... we agree that it's impossible for a human to turn into a ferret. So at what point do absurdly low probabilities turn into something that could happen?
The probability of generating a collision address is the same as this: Fill the entire volume of the milky way galaxy with sand, drop two people off at two different locations on this huge conglomerate of sand and then having them pick the same grain by chance. It's so absurdly unlikely, that if it did happen people would be looking for flaws in the random number generator (or the hashing algorithm) way before they would even consider that it "just happened."

BIP109 is defunct so I don't know of any proposal or alt client that uses a 75% activation threshold. Is there one still?  The emergent consensus hypothesis doesn't imply a need for a discrete single activation threshold.
It's absolutely backwards to use miner signalling (alone) to activate a hardfork anyway. It makes perfect sense with a softfork to use it, but a successful hardfork depends on economically important nodes of which miners are only a subset (and no where near the majority). Using them alone to make a decision puts them in the unenviable situation of trying to assess other participants' readiness. It's like asking a person to dive into a pool that they don't know what the depth of the water is.

I was speaking more towards your absolute statement. For most transactions at that time, fees were pretty much voluntary, but there were plenty of people that paid fees at that time. For example:  from early 2012 has 26 transactions in it, of those 17 had transactions fees in them (which would be considered exorbitant at today's exchange rate - I picked this block because one of those transactions is mine).
I think the answer is somewhere between the extremes in this case. Satoshi regularly used centrally planned and "arbitrary" limits in order to discourage unwanted social behavior. There was also multiple debates about lowering the "default" transaction rate through those few years using the same argument that you're making right now. I'm thinking you've read this recent paper: 
If you ignore the proof-of-work and hardware costs of mining (which contribute 98% of the cost-per-transaction) you're still left with each transaction costing 3-10 cents USD per transaction on bandwidth, validation, and storage costs. These costs don't benefit from scale increases of blocksize and I think it's reasonable for the initiator of the transaction to at least pay for that part. At some *arbitrary* point, users of Bitcoin are going to have to bear some of the costs of using the network since miners cannot and will not be subsidized by seigniorage in the future (if the network keeps the 21M coin limit). 
There's also plenty of technical reasons to keep the blocksize limit reasonable, but 2MB or 4MB is probably OK at this time (Edit: Provided we make changes to SigOp limits or fix the quadratic validation scaling problem with large transactions - I'd certainly prefer the latter since it doesn't introduce another "arbitrary" limit).

Bitcoin scams take a different form than what you would see from a typical 419 scammer. 419 email scams select for stupid people with misspellings and poor grammar. It's deliberate, though. They need the dumb people to follow through all the steps to give them their money. Because of this people get the mistaken impression that scams are easy to spot because they look "unprofessional." Bitcoin scams are more likely to take a long con approach and are more likely to be designed to select for "smarter" marks. In Bitcoin, you're more likely to see hacked accounts, sleeper accounts, and more elaborate set-ups in an effort to lend legitimacy to the scam for as long as possible.

I actually had to correct Tim Swanson on this a year or so ago. It's not fake work... they are still building on the longest/most work chain and they do make it that much harder to reverse previous transactions. They just aren't confirming new transactions. Not exactly desirable behavior, but it's really hard to prevent in a way that doesn't open up things to other ways to game the system. It is possible, and it has been discussed (search SPV mining, since that's a related discussion).
What's going on is multifactoral. First blocks get sent to miners as a header first. They can choose to mine on an already verified block or they can choose to mine on the header. This introduces two problems. If you choose to continue mining on the already verified block and the block header you just received turns out to be a valid block (which it is most of the time) then you are "stale" mining. If you start mining on the block without verifying then you are "SPV" mining. What antpool has decided to do is to mine before they have verified the entire block, but they also want to make sure the block they are mining is also valid. Since they don't know all the transactions in the previous block, they don't know which ones should not be included again. So instead they mine a empty block until they have the previous block verified, at which point they can build a block that has transactions from the mempool in it.

Last public post of satoshi: 


This was after node/miner separation started becoming a thing (also after the overflow bug in which, for a short time, was the highest work chain on the network). This happened again in the March 2013 bug, which could have worked itself out fine either way, but it was decided to downgrade back to the lower work chain. These are 2 concrete examples of the time where the majority of the hashing power was working on "invalid" higher proof-of-work chain and chose to upgrade or downgrade to a lower proof-of-work chain because it was the in economic majority, and economically important nodes that enforced it.
Suppose a miner had near infinite hashrate and decided to fork the chain where rewards are 100 BTC per block... would the economic majority allow him to do that? Absolutely not. There's plenty of things that a majority miner can do, but they cannot change hardforking rules without approval of the wider economy (they can destroy that economy). The fact that they can with softforks, to a point, is concerning enough.

This needs to be repeated more. It's likely the second block found was not Satoshi since it was found hours after the software was released.

Hmm, after reading through this a bit more, I'm thinking another type of study would be more useful. Take a random sample of nodes on the network and follow them for a prespecified period of time.

Have you spent some time analyzing Organ of Corti's latest blog on this? It seems to me from 2012-2013, most miners self-limited blocks to 500 kb, which actually resulted in higher fees for them, near the end of 2013 the default was increased and average total fees per block actually fell (as indicated by the lighter colors, note not USD, but BTC denomination).
Have you read this paper:  If so what do you think of the authors conclusions?


in the blocks themselves? The reason is the following. When a miner tries to solve a block,
the transactions are already in the network. In this case, he is a Stackelberg follower and
he has an incentive to include all transactions in the limitless block he tries to solve. He
could announce before solving a block that if he indeed solves a block, he will not include
all transactions. But this announcement would not be credible. Indeed, since miners
are in competition with distributed hashing power, the transactions a miner would not
include would certainly be included just ten minutes later by another miner. Including all
transactions whatever the fee attached is the only subgame perfect Nash equilibrium of
the game we described.


Can we rely on things like stale block rates and other protocol idiosyncrasies/inefficiencies (edit: which this cited paper ignores) to actually provide enough incentive for miners to self-limit or does some sort of automatable blocksize limit have to be in place (Flex cap or a fixed cap)?

Good points. I should have worded it like this: I do not think the core devs are responsible for current failures, but if there's one thing that may have been improved it would be communication. That said, I don't think that would have prevented this controversy. I didn't mean to imply the Core devs are to blame and they have dramatically improved in this regard anyway.

Precisely. Coumadin has pretty good reversibility and a couple of other advantages (including cost) over the newer drugs, though I see the new drugs as promising (they do have their advantages as well). Funnily enough we are now seeing reversal agents for the new drugs and evidence that monitoring would improve outcomes as well. For example, Praxbind (idarucizumab) is the new reversal agent for Pradaxa (dabigatran). Great, except it costs &gt; $1,000 a dose.
Personally I like to be in the middle of an adoption period when it comes to prescribing a new drug (with a few exceptions).

I braved listening to the podcast earlier today. I'm not a fan of the kind of shock jock stuff they do, but they do have some real information in there. Would not recommend unless you can stand what I would consider a mix of carrot top, howard stern, and steve wozniak.
They said something about the wallet service being shut down. I don't use Coinbase at all anymore so I don't know much about what services they offer. I do think it's strange that a few people have mentioned things like that from the Satoshi Roundtable (e.g luke-jr mentioning KYC/AML concerns and junseth saying this).

Actual medical doctor here. Astroturfing exists, but the stuff she states about Wikipedia are mostly incorrect: 
I sometimes check Wikipedia and compare it to established standards of care and new literature. I rarely see it incorrect, and almost never egregiously so.   In fact, I've seen more errors and controversial opinions on Up-to-date (a resource that I and many physicians use frequently).
Evaluating medical studies requires a good amount of knowledge in statistics and pathophysiology. Reproducibility is important as well. That's why it's rare for physicians to uniformily change their practice patterns. One study is okay. Many is better. Xarelto/Eliquis/Pradaxa are new drugs for the treatment of non-valvular atrial fibrillation and thromboembolism. So why is coumadin still in use? Some doctors have a lot of inertia for treatment, but other have done the research and decided that for now coumadin is still a useful drug for many people.
Often times I consult a physician and am surprised they use treatment X instead of treatment Y for condition A. I sometimes will ask them about the "why" of it and often times they can tell me what studies they are aware of and their reasons why they think study W was better than study Z. I will often times take it upon myself to look at those studies with a more critical eye.

The libsecp256k1 repo has 771 commits dating back 4 years. Most are from sipa. Hal may have helped with some of the initial work, but to say they just "took" his work is absolutely absurd. 
Edit: after researching this, Hal had about a 20% improvement, which is rather meager compared to what turned into a 700% increase that eventually was achieved.
This is meant as no disrespect to Hal Finney, he was/is a brilliant man. But I hate to see how hard that sipa and others have worked on that library, only to have credit take away from them by a easily repeated meme.

RBF (and it's cousin opt-in) has a lot of heat on it. Not sure I would believe anything you read on reddit about it. It's node policy though, so I don't see it as being all that harmful. Politically it doesn't make any sense... UX wise I think it will help people with "stuck" transactions (I can't even count how many reddit "help" posts could have been fixed with it). There also might be some scorched earth things you could do with it, too. Not sure, I really haven't looked into it much.

The idea of a "block chain" has probably been reinvented numerous times and not even named. The fact that Merkle trees and the like existed in the literature way before "block chain" is evidence of that.
For example, see this: 


That's what so funny about banks with these "blockchain" proposals... these ideas are at least 20-30 years old. The fact that they are just now getting it together because "the blockchain" is evidence that they have no idea what's going on. I suspect people that invented financial cryptography saw it as an excuse to bring "the suits" into the modern age.

Ever since you started posting your comments on a whole have been valuable and well reasoned, even from the beginning if I remember correctly.
I'm glad you took the time to publish this. I strongly believe there are other much more harder to detect types of social manipulation occurring. I'd suggest one avenue is to look into account age and correlate it with large subscriber bursts to in the past couple of years. I suspect we have had a lot of farmed accounts. I also suspect hacked accounts as well (a year or two ago I had someone try to reset my password a couple times). I've heard reports of people selling there accounts for money, but I've never seen absolute proof of this.
What this does show is that some people are willing to pay a lot of money to manipulate opinion. The only reason they'd want to do that would be to make even more money or gain power. To me that makes it most likely to be altcoin pumpers &gt; bitcoin corps &gt; banking corps &gt; governments. Regardless, we should work to keep sources cited and argue on merits. Avoid personal attacks when possible, but don't be afraid to be direct to notable people in this space. I regret not being more forceful when explaining the dangers of leaving Bitcoin in MtGox. I regret not being more vocal when other scams have come and gone. Bitcoin has weathered a lot of different types of attacks, but social engineering is and will almost always be one of the most effective types of "hacks." We all know that Nigerian princes are vying to give us money, but more sophisticated attacks work. Let's not forget that Bitpay was targeted successfully with this kind of attack. Really social media manipulation is really just generalized social engineering.
The thwarting of social engineering is one of the things that makes Bitcoin so valuable. The only way to break it is to have people run a broken Bitcoin. The only way to fix it is continually make it robust against social and technical attacks.

13% of Antpool's blocks are empty in the last month, which is the highest of any of the major mining pools. They also began mining more frequent empty blocks recently (when most of the other pools are mining less than they used to). They have the second smallest average blocksize of any of the major miners (not necessarily a bad thing).

Exactly. I'm not sure what the right way is. In fact, I think it's important to point out that the multiple mutually exclusive paths that Bitcoin could take could be "right" in their own way. Personally, preservation of the permissionless, immutable nature is important to me. I understand other people want a great payment network. I think we can achieve both through good-faith efforts, though.

Regarding EVIL softforks, we really need to work on educating people on those. I have a feeling if Classic took a "softfork" to 2MB route they would be more "successful".
We need to start getting that clearly in to the public's eye as to why they are so dangerous.
It's funny, Bitcoin needs just a little "social glue" to hold things together and we as humans still suck at it.

One of the main objections regarding implementing segwit was the way it was being deployed in the form of a softfork.
See here: 
"The negative: soft-fork, quick roll-out claim, use in lieu of 2M HF."
The primary negative cited is the soft-fork deployment concerns. If jtoomim's plan is "rebase from core" then he plans to deploy SW using a... soft fork. The fact that there is a hard fork version (also primarily written by sipa) out there (e.g. elements alpha:  makes this even more ludicrious.
Imagine your sipa... you put years of work into fixing malleability issues, discovering numerous CVE's, implementing code changes which dramatically increase verification speeds as well as decrease node overhead and then somebody comes along with a plan to cut you out, but then they still want to benefit from your hard work. It's not in the spirit of FOSS at all. Even if you consider prior forks in other (non-consensus critical) software projects such as linux, no one would have the audacity to do this without a well constructed team of their own.

I personally value it because I often learn a lot more about the system when reading their posts.

opinion on theymos's moderation practices have been been pretty public. Look through a few pages of his comments on his profile. And he doesn't (and can't) speak for all of the Core Devs. Seems that they are doing a better job of communicating, but honestly the fact they have to react as a cohesive unit is disconcerting - FOSS works best when meritorious debate is possible. The code is the consensus of their actions and it should speak for itself. If you need somebody to translate it for you ask, because thats what nullc can usually do really well. He can also speak, based on his own volition, his personal opinions but not what everyone on the software project feels. 
I don't think people realize the volume of absolutely hateful disgusting things that these developers have received (including Hearn, Andresen, and all the others). I've spent too much of my time on and realize that anonymous people can be pretty shitty to eachother, but I've seen pretty elaborate death threats posted. There's a reason that nullc defends against the satoshi witchhunting so much: he knows what a small percent of it feels like just being associated with a project like bitcoin.

The point I was trying to make is that payment channels have existed *for years*. Not LN, just Plain Jane payment channels. Most day-to-day merchant use of bitcoin goes through Bitpay or Coinbase anyway. Perhaps there was malleability problem or something, but with SW in place it will be even easier. Not only that, if either of these companies implemented them, I'm betting a significant amount of that code could be reused to interface with LN (if it ever comes into existence).

For the consistency of argument... Gavin and Garzik have both had objections with a softfork rollout of segwit. So naturally the best way to rollout of segwit is with a hardfork. That code is already written, too. I want segwit because of the malleability fixes that lowers the chance that other devs that produce software outside of node clients can shoot themselves in the foot. If it comes in a hardfork or a softfork I don't really care. Both have their problems.

It's absolutely a core wallet functionality change. To take advantage of the benefits of lightning (low fees that do not depend on the seignorage of the miners and security tradeoffs - don't have to worry about 0-confs any more, but now have to worry about contesting messages, dealing with locktime management, etc.) the way wallets will have to operate will be completely different. They will have to be able to establish routes and trade transactional data in a way that is completely different than the way current wallets do things.
It doesn't scream centralization to me at all, it's quite the opposite. If they get the routing set up in a very robust way, I'm betting a lightning hub could run off a cell phone (there should be a load-balancing effect that occurs naturally if they get the incentives right). If and when LN takes off there will be an explosion of competing wallets that will occur... somebody will write a analog of Bitcoinj for LN (or whatever "payment channel network" becomes dominant). The cool thing is you're probably going to see hubs that can speak different variations of these networks (acting as a bridge).
Sorry, this post is a bit of a mess.
Poon/Dryja do not work for blockstream (AFAIK) - I think they are starting their own startup. Rusty does, but he's the only the dev there that is working on LN (AFAIK). If you look at the lightning-dev list, there's quite a few non-blockstream devs posting there (including some names that are quite big if you follow other decentralized projects).
@_date: 2016-03-03 23:07:05
Yes, absolutely. The only thing that is preventing getting both is the lack of cooperation from "both" (in quotes because there's more than two) sides. The difference between the two roadmaps is a reflection of that. This is a governance issue, not a scalability issue.
Edit: I should clarify. I want bigger blocks, but I agree with the core roadmap because I believe SegWit should come first as a softfork and then there should be a hardfork cleanup (hopefully with other wanted fixes) that also simultaneously increases the blocksize.

**Ok how do you disallow the behavior?**
"Make a rule that miners have to include more than the coinbase transaction or the blocks won't be accepted!"
**Ok I did that now they are making blocks which have 2 transactions in them, one of which is a transactions we've not seen on the network... seems that didn't work...**
"Ooo I know, make a rule that the transaction included in the block have to have been seen by network to be accepted as valid."
**Ok well how would that work?**
"Hmm... we could... uh... thin blocks.. uh"
**Why don't you just accept that any simple solution you've come up with is not going to work, sit down until you actually understand the problem at hand?**
Back in 2011 (or was it 2012?) there was a mysterious miner with something like 1/8th the hashrate (probably an early FPGA miner) that would **always** publish empty blocks. There was quite a bit of discussion back then about how that behavior should be disallowed. The discussion really hasn't changed all that much since then. Peter Todd and Greg Maxwell are the only ones that I know of that came up with somewhat of a workable solution (probably about a year ago)... you could find it in the devlist if you did some research.

I'm not trying to vilify you. Like I said, I'm sure you're one of the good guys. Core is not a "team" any more than the people that contribute to linux kernel development work is a team. They are individuals that work towards something together *loosely* and it's hard for any one of them to speak for each other. Maybe if you asked, say Peter Todd directly (as in private in a conversation) to post on his thoughts he'd be inclined to. I'm sorry if I upset you. This software project is emotionally draining for a lot of people, but I want to believe that we do want the best for it. Your contributions speak for themselves, as do Gavin's and as do Maxwell's. Deescalation is going to take some time and I think it would help if there was more forgiveness and understanding *on all sides*. Let me put it this way, usually a hand on shoulder or a hand shake is perceived as a gesture of goodwill to someone in a good state of health, but to someone that suffers from PTSD or has been abused previously may see this as a slight against them. They treat everything as suspect and that means trust will be harder to earn. Being too earnest to "prove" goodwill just makes it seem even less genuine. That's all I'm trying to say.

Try to replicate it for yourself using the GPG software from that time. The command line to produce that key would have to perfectly predict the default settings of a future version that did not exist at that time.

No cryptocurrency is or ever will be completely "trustless"... and that includes Bitcoin. I also didn't mean to downplay the trusted setup either (I did write that other problems could be there).

I don't know and I don't know. I think they are probably appropriately invested in when you consider the salary those people would get in other companies, I wouldn't say the investment is out of the realm of reason. Compare to other Bitcoin companies capitalization such as Blockchain, Coinbase, 21, and Bitpay. The question is what do they plan to do to turn a profit? If you look at places that Adam Back has worked before, he was involved in a previous company with Austin Hill called Zero Knowledge System: 
If you look at what Blockstream is doing, I think it's very similar to the goals of that venture (advance a technology, and we'll make a profit along the way), which was only moderately successful if I understand correctly. The interesting thing is who (Ian Goldberg, among others) worked for that company and where they went.

I believe doing this would be least damaging to the ecosystem (well except if it never happens in the first place). People seem to think a chain fork with 75% mining power will be a simple thing. A lot of high value coin holders are going to be playing very expensive games when the time comes. Switching to a different POW secures the Core chain, redistributed mining and resets the clock to figure out problems that do not have clear solutions yet. Additionally it gives a clear instruction to existing miners on what to do. Expect tools to emerge that will help diverge the post fork utxo sets.

The paper I linked has next to nothing to do with the previous papers they have released since it's about providing the public parameters for the secure setup using a multiparty computation. Additionally, it seems they have made significant improvements from Zerocoin which was completely non-viable due to the proof size to what they have now. Zcash exists in code. I've built and run it. It seems to work... it's slow and ugly... but the code is there now: 
Sean Bowe is the same guy that helped contribute to this:
I'm not saying go buy Zcash or anything like that (you can't anyway and I also don't really care for the initial investor fund distribution or whatever they call it). But their whitepapers aren't just some made up shit like [insert other scamcoin]... real cryptographers are really vetting what they have published.
Even if zcash is a complete and abysmal failure (which I suspect there's a good chance it will be) the science that will come out of it could eventually benefit Bitcoin.

Another good reason to wait for more confirmations if it's taking longer for blocks to be found.
Here's the money shot from the paper:

z | 6 | 9| 18| 20| 32| 58| 133
zsn | 5 |8 |11| 15| 24| 41| 81

I think I consider myself a minarchist (though I really don't like labeling myself) and agree with very much what you're saying. People keep saying it's not a technical problem, but I strongly disagree. I have an engineering background and I'm a physician. I know what it's like to keep someone going on life support and having to make trade-offs in order to get them through. For example, when someone is in septic shock we often start IV fluids at very high rates and start medicines which cut off peripheral perfusion so that they can perfuse their internal organs. They can lose fingers and toes when this happens. Families around get upset unless you very carefully explain what's going on (why are they so edematous/swollen? why is their skin mottled and fingers blue?). But I'm doing the right thing to save their life. The appreciation I get is usually after I got them through it or help families deal with the inevitabilities.
The main failure of the Core devs was a failure of communication. In my line of work that's the most likely thing to get you sued. I've seen doctors that I highly respect and are almost always right get sued because they didn't learn that lesson and I've seen terrible doctors that make mistakes all the time, but are affable. Somehow, they get through their entire career without ever having to pay the consequences.
Bitcoin is very complex. It has numerous feedback mechanisms and esoteric pieces. Yet, it's deceptively simple as well. People fall into traps where they think they understand something when they are actually have their thinking completely backwards (a lot of people believe that mining power drives the market price, etc.). I thought I understood the system pretty well a few years ago, but only in retrospect and after reading a lot of code and writing do I realize what I didn't know. I still have a lot to learn.

Nick Szabo's comments on this:
So you should pick the side that has the less popular opinion. ;)
In all seriousness, I think some people have a hard time accepting that some problems can have multiple right, but mutually exclusive, answers. My personal opinion is that any changes to the underlying Bitcoin protocol (whether hard or soft forks, etc.) should require as close to a rough consensus of **experts** as possible. Miners are supposed to be duteous (or "honest"), not beholden to their own views. They should be allowed to manage what they have control over (their own mempools), but we as people (and nodes) should be able to retain the right to fire them. BUT I can understand why another person wouldn't view it this way.

I think it's important to point out that prime factorization is not going as fast as you think it is, just that there's a certain class of numbers which can be factored to prime with a smaller number of qubits using a "minimization" algorithm. The 143 and 56153 factorizations only required 4 qubits using a different class of algorithm which (AFAIK) can't be made general, whereas a 21 factorization requires 10 qubits by Shor's algorithm. Way out of my league of really understanding, though so I could be wrong.

It might be important to figure out what proportion of long-chain transactions are spam, shuffling, coin mixing, etc. before writing them all off. I doubt it could be easily ascertained, though. And just from gut-feeling I think it's at least reasonable to remove those types of transactions from the analysis to get an idea of what's going on. That said, it's almost assuredly a lower bound of adoption. Frankly, just as long as it's positive I'm happy.

Good question... I think the answer is that the advantage only occurs when there's a race. So the advantage itself is kind of small (and can be made smaller). It's also plainly obvious that if miners only cared about short term, they'd do it more often. I think someone like or could write a long treatise on it...

I very rarely get to say this, but I think you're wrong. There's multiple scenarios that could play out, but few of them actually end with the Core coin dying:
* Scenario 1: The classic coin fork never occurs.
* Scenario 2: The classic coin fork occurs, the fork occurs just after a difficulty adjustment.
* Scenario 3: The classic coin fork occurs, the fork somewhere in the middle of a difficult adjustment.
* Scenario 4: Core devs have had their gentleman's agreement with the people violated - switch to a different PoW at same time as contentious fork occurs.
* Scenario 5: Everyone actually reaches a high percent consensus and abandons the old fork.
The only one I would say 100% would end in the Core coin disappearing completely is  All the others seem to provide a non-zero chance of survival of the other coin. 
I believe that people such as Luke are principled enough to continue on with their vision of what Bitcoin should be even if their version is not the most popular one, but I might be wrong. No matter what the market is not going to like the results and many old users will not be happy.

Pseudocyeses. In all seriousness, pretty much all things Bitcoin have a non-zero chance of being exploited since it's built on a number of assumptions that X won't happen (where X is usually miners doing something maliciously). So I'm using "almost impossible" in a colloquial sense.

Please note that this is not meant to be a direct reference to Bitcoin... it's actually speaking about a technology with similarly broad implications. Those ideals should be maintained.
Bitcoin, in the way I see it, is the realization of what de Tocqueville was getting on about (and at that time believed couldn't exist). The problem is that Bitcoin is not quite there because it still requires *some* human intervention... and we are still capable of screwing it up.

An individual miner can decide what he mines and what he doesn't, that is true, but if he doesn't control &gt; 33-50% of the hashpower on the network he can not set the fees. A less than &lt; 33% miner can mine empty blocks to drive up fees, but without cartelization other miners will be happy to pick up the fee paying transactions to the detriment of the miner attempting to drive up the fees.
So why are miners mining non-full or empty blocks? Well, spy mining still seems to be occurring on the network which explains a significant amount of the empty blocks and that do occur. Technical glitches may be getting in the way too (bugs in code run by a mining pool screw up transaction selection, better just to mine the coinbase alone than wait until the bug is fixed). 
Another would be to send transactions around the network which would drive up the lowest acceptable feerate. Note that this doesn't require miners at all (although it would be less costly if one was a miner, you'd be able to "catch" some of your money back as well as get higher fee paying transactions as well). This is very troubling to me... it's multivariate and I don't think has been that well analyzed as an attack vector (if anyone has a high quality analysis of this please link or PM!).
In the end, miners "setting the fees" is a very simplistic way to look at it.
See here: 


in the blocks themselves? The reason is the following. When a miner tries to solve a block,
the transactions are already in the network. In this case, he is a Stackelberg follower and
he has an incentive to include all transactions in the limitless block he tries to solve. He
could announce before solving a block that if he indeed solves a block, he will not include
all transactions. But this announcement would not be credible. Indeed, since miners
are in competition with distributed hashing power, the transactions a miner would not
include would certainly be included just ten minutes later by another miner. **Including all
transactions whatever the fee attached is the only subgame perfect Nash equilibrium of
the game we described.**
The paper makes a number of simplistic assumptions about bitcoin (mostly ignores the p2p layer of it and some of those considerations), but at this point it's mostly right.
@_date: 2016-01-29 03:29:20
The point is the experts job in Bitcoin is a bit different than the expert's job at the FED. Bitcoin itself is supposed to be the policy-setter... the experts of Bitcoin should only make changes which the economic majority approve of when they remain consistent with what Bitcoin is (softforks). Ironically, I feel it's too easy to put in a softfork change, too (miners shouldn't be the sole authority on them either, but figuring out how to disallow that behavior is a can of worms). Hardforks should only be implemented when there is near unanimity because they are so dangerous - both in a political sense and technical sense.
The experts in Bitcoin should be custodial to the protocol, not the users of the protocol. The users should be willing to change to a different protocol, not alter the existing one. Obviously there are exceptions (and arguably a max blocksize increase would be one of those exceptions, just like segwit).
This is all my opinion on the subject. I don't mean to speak for anyone.

I know you can't speak for all Core devs, but will you continue to support Core as currently envisioned in the road map if this contentious hard fork happens?

The problem reduces to the same though: how can a DAC operate at anything but a minimal level without depending on trusted sources outside of the blockchain? 
I like ethereum a lot. Time will tell if they are able to kill all the unknown unknowns that future exploits are hiding in. I've seen a lot of the work required to make Bitcoin fairly robust against DOS attacks among other security problems. I'm worried that without the science of cryptocurrency being locked down well enough adding another level of complexity on top of that science may be a fool's errand. I really hope I'm wrong, though.

He has a stats page, but I'm not quite sure how to parse the data (or exactly understand what your question is asking, I think I get the gist though). I think median latency is around 300 ms for the entire relay network to "hear" about a block.
I was trying to make the same point as luke-jr, though. The only reason orphan rates aren't higher now is because of the numerous improvements in the p2p code of Bitcoin, as well various workarounds (See IBLT as another not quite implemented example). It's not like the devs have been sitting on their hands for 7 years. There's also some undesirable miner behavior going on, which people are working on ways to mitigate.
@_date: 2016-01-29 03:01:52
Nothing sad about it. If Satoshi could, his protocol would have been byzantine fault proof rather than tolerant... the problem is that is impossible. He would prefer people use his client because other clients unintentionally or intentionally inducing a hardfork is disastrous for all (minority and majority).


If you think the **only** advantage that Bitcoin has over these altcoins is its network effect, I don't even know what to say. Ethereum will fall to centralization effects faster. Litecoin doesn't scale any better or (arguably) settles any faster than Bitcoin just because it has faster blocks. And monero's privacy features can be implemented better and easier in several different ways, including in ways that could be applied to Bitcoin. Bitcoin's network effect is not the only reason it's ahead - it's developer effect.

I've done way too much research on this. It seems that Satoshi didn't really invent much of anything new, but what he did and what other didn't do, was put the code together to do it. He made the right trade-offs. If you read some of the discussion on e-cash with Wei Dai, Adam Back, Ian Grigg, Szabo, and others you'll see them hash out (pun intended) many of the ideas that became Bitcoin (b-money + hashcash is pretty close, read the eternity protocol posts as well). The only other real preceding work **in code** would be RPOW by Hal Finney and Adam Back's hashcash (which was used in RPOW and Bitcoin [but reimplemented]). I also think the ideas of distributed data storage is important (things like mojonation and eternity service). Satoshi idea to vary difficulty is probably the biggest contributing factor to the success of Bitcoin.
Szabo's post about Bitcoin really explains it quite well:

This is precisely why when thinking about making consensus level changes you have to think like an adversary. 
Let me explain. Imagine the cutest puppy in the world standing on a sidewalk. People are walking by. What do you think the chances somebody is going to punt that dog into the street? Pretty low since most people aren't psychopaths and even the ones that are aren't going to do that because they will weigh the repercussions of public admonition against the impulses. Well the internet is like that sidewalk... except everybody is walking by at once and there's not really anyway to see who kicks the dog. The dog is gonna get kicked.

As a doctor, I do find this funny. We have a lot of drugs that we use that rely on number needed to treat and number needed to harm analysis. For example, during a heart attack, most people know to take aspirin before they get to a hospital. Do you know how many lives that saves? If 42 people do that, one of them will have their life saved from doing that. If 167 do that something like 4 will have their life saved and 1 will have a significant GI bleed.
We have responsibility to do things right the first time, because there might not be a next time. I believe Gavin thinks that Bitcoin is more resilient than the other devs. He may be right, but I don't think that's the right way to develop. He's being cavalier, which is sometimes needed.

There's a few things that will be endlessly used to FUD Zcash in perpetuity: the way founders are getting rewarded... the initial investors... the "private" company... the trusted setup. So my criticism is on the social layer, nothing really to do with technical.

Since the beginning of Bitcoin. He's not the first person to do this either as many have done this successfully. I've done it as an experiment and was successful on the first try (please note I attempted a double-spend to an address I controlled so there was no legal concerns). Now how many actually do it against Bitpay or Coinbase is another question. One of the dice sites did have thousands of BTC stolen by GHash.io using Finney style double-spends, though. Personally, I think digital goods should always require a confirmation. Restaurants and other brick and mortars should use similar heuristics as they would to guard against a hot check or counterfeit bill passer. Or wait until something *like* LN comes along and fixes these problems with a stronger guarantee. 
There is no countermeasures for Finney style double spend (save a block reorg), but it does require a miner's assistance. Other types that don't depend on miner cooperation are a little less likely, but are pretty easy to pull off as well depending on the "rules" of the transactions. What PT did has a high probability of success because Coinbase hasn't been bothered enough to fix the problem. Seems like it was a bit Grey hat, though.

I particularly like his reasoning with this. Search CONOP in the post to see the point he's trying to make.
Since this thread devolved into a rather heated gun debate, I'd thought I'd provide a little more substance: I think we can extend the gun analogy a little further. A gun owned by a responsible user is safer than a gun owned by a reckless owner, just as a node owned by a thoughtful owner is worth more than one run by someone that isn't.  By thoughtful, I mean a node owner that works to configure his node to be helpful to the network as a whole (perhaps by allowing Tor traffic or keeping it up and as well connected as possible). 
Additionally, I like the CONOP idea, but it's not the be-all end-all of decentralization "measurement". I do think it drives home the point that a node shouldn't cost an arm and a leg to run.

It should be noted that MtGox's leaked code did indicate that transaction malleability would have allowed stealing funds if they also had incompetent staff. The software would make a transaction to payout someone then use the txid as a database key to list that as paid out. An attacker would malleate that transaction and then say to the exchange operator: "Hey this transaction never confirmed, I never got my money."
At this point, the operator would look at the txid they had and realize it never confirmed and then issue another transaction. There's pretty good evidence that a few thousand bitcoin were stolen like this. Also, recall that several exchanges shutdown for hours to days to "fix" the problem. Remember the mad rush to develop a "normalized" txid?
From a developer perspective, things like payment channels are much easier to work with if you don't have to worry about third-party malleability.

You have a dramatically different reading and it's exactly why these kind of arguments are so stupid. He also clearly says: "although it would at least reinforce to user the importance of staying with the **official version**." I don't believe Satoshi was infallible at all anyway. Arguments should be able to stand on their own. I also don't believe the mining majority will determine the winner in this, because I don't think there will be a winner if a contentious hardfork happens. That's why appealing to these writings is so incredibly misguided. It's easy enough to construct scenarios where the mining majority will not win in the long run. That's why it's incredibly important to point out that Satoshi wanted "honest" miners to be in the majority.
As a bitcoin user, who has been here quite a long time, I don't think you have my best interests at heart. You think the miner consensus hammer is big, but it has as good of chance to be a self-destruct button.

It's complicated since there's probably multiple reasons. To understand a little bit more about it you'd probably have to read about what happened after BIP66: 
Some miners at that time were (doubt they still are?) not performing any validation on the blocks they were building on. Another problem is if you start mining on a block before you have completely verified it, there's a chance you might include a transaction in your mempool that would be considered invalid... so the best way to prevent that is to not put in transactions in the block except ones you know weren't included (your coinbase transaction and any transactions that you want in but the network hasn't seen).
It just as suspicious that Bitfury has a 0% rate... I've not looked into the data, but I suspect they are including transactions that aren't being broadcast to the network (perhaps an agreement with an exchange? They may have openly stated why, but I don't recall).

You can spend segwit inputs to nonsegwit addresses and vice versa. They are perfectly fungible in the same way p2sh can spend to p2pkh and vice versa. It just works. I have some very cold storage coins that I will not spend out because I know that nonsegwit transactions will still be confirmed into the far future.
Also there is no solution that we know of that fixes self-signer  malleability (hope I'm using the correct term, it's been a while since I looked at the BIPs). This includes segwit transactions or any other proposed solution.

It's still doable, but security and usability tradeoffs would be made.

It absolutely was. Fun fact, the blocksize limit was put in over at least two commits... one where miners using the bitcoin client wouldn't produce blocks greater than 1 MB (later restricted to 250kb) and one where they wouldn't accept blocks greater than 1 MB. There was never any evidence that an attacker had produced a larger than a 1 mb block between the 2 commits and Satoshi never explained to anyone why. 
Another fun fact... theymos complained about the commit to satoshi in private before a build was released... and Satoshi told him that he was going to do it anyway.

Satoshi used the Cypherpunk playbook to a T when he released Bitcoin. There was some discussion in the mid/late 90's/early's 00's on how to be an internet activist in the setting of overreacting and overreaching governments. Among this discussion was ideas of using anonymity and pseudonymity when releasing big contributions. I don't have time to search the cryptography mailing list for this, but you can find it if you want. "Satoshi" was invented to release Bitcoin once he had made enough progress on the idea.

The big problem I think you are going to run into is the whole blockchain vs bitcoin hype. You can find reports from Goldman Sachs, Ernst and Young, PWC, and KPMG just by search google with the name of the company and "bitcoin report". You already know about the IMF and CPMI paper. Credit Suisse also has a bitcoin paper.
The big problem with all of these reports is they are filtered through the "blockchain not bitcoin" hype that was going on a while ago. If you can get away with it, I'd suggest using this as a source:

I've been around bitcoin for a while and I can tell you that it goes from one crisis to the next. Personally, I think it's always going to be like this (at least for next 5-10 years). It's frustrating and it's fun, but if the fun isn't outweighing the frustrating for you, take the time to get back into balance.

I could try, but it'll be another day I think. I have to go through a few different sources of material to make a convincing argument (source code release dates, etc.). I'll reply here when I put it together, because I'll probably have enough together to make a post of it. The only reason I haven't done it is because I think it's futile. Satoshi's opinions are not always consistent with each other, but if you consider when things were said compared to events of the time (The slashdotting, advent of pooled mining, separation of node power from mining power, overflow bug, removal of the "market" code, etc.) you'll see his opinion on "microtransactions" and "miner majority" change. Arguing what Satoshi meant is pretty silly because of that.

LN (if it can ever be implemented) will almost certainly make this situation better. In fact, a simple payment channel to coinbase and bitpay with a compatible wallet would make these types of attacks almost impossible. No idea why neither of these companies have invested the time in making that happen, but I'm sure they have their reasons.

In the second season of "Silicon Valley" the protagonist's company is starting to get a lot of VC interest in it and they are surrounded with numerous offers of investment. Near the end of the episode his friend tells him to take the lowest valuation. He then meets up with another friend who's business has recently failed and asks the question, "What would happen if you asked for less?"
* "I guess technically I could have... Huh? I suppose you could argue that it might have been easier to hit more realistic benchmarks and hit break even. Then we wouldn't have faced that down round and we wouldn't have to settle for acquisition. All that money fucked me."
I think this is what's about to happen with many of the  companies in the sector. I'm sure some investment groups are in it for the long haul, but I never understood why the high dollar investments were required in the industry at this time. I remember specifically Bitpay stating that they really weren't looking for much venture capital, but this changed when Coinbase and other started getting investment. All these companies became Stackelberg followers (I think that's the correct model - I'm relying on Cunningham's law here). I guess they expected exponential growth, but why? I'm wondering what would have happened if MtGox didn't screw up so much.
Realistically, I think a lot of this block size debate is a tempest in a teapot at this point. People are arguing that explosive growth is just around the corner, but I would argue is that Bitcoin as an automaton should be able to adapt to decreasing or increasing adoption rather gracefully. It's going to be interesting when it comes time to pay the VC piper. I think we'll see a lot of these companies blaming the technology rather than themselves, which won't be pretty.

I'd say appealing to the whitepaper is just as deleterious. The whitepaper is like looking at the Colosseum from 10,000 ft in the air and then being asked to build it. For example, the idea of SPV was put in there, but it could have never been correctly implemented with the strong assurances that Satoshi had wanted. This is underscored by the fact that the code was written before the whitepaper and Satoshi later made comments that were not entirely consistent with what was stated in the whitepaper. He doesn't even mention smart contracts or script in the whitepaper if IIRC. I think the idea of consensus building in an open source manner is the way to move forward and at some point Bitcoin as a protocol should ossify.

It's more about the number of inputs in a transaction than the value (size of the transaction in bytes). Average size is about 0.0005 BTC right now to get into the next 1 or 2 blocks, if you an wait a while 0.0003 BTC would get you in a few hours (if transaction is average in size).

In the way soft forks have traditionally been used, I follow what you're saying. In fact, soft forks, traditionally are used to make the protocol more tyrannical (or less permissive). So in that way, it's consistent with my opinion. I'm a little more wary of these "firm fork" ideas.
I haven't done enough reading or research into "firm forks" to make an informed opinion, but my uninformed opinion is that they have the potential to be very dangerous. I think the segwit fork is worth it, but "firm forks" as a class seem to fall under "hard fork properties (increased permissibility), with soft forks deployment ease." That's concerning to me, but I reserve the right to change my opinion on it. :)
Regarding the "radical idea" behind Bitcoin, I kind of see it as an emergence of a new philosophy in a way... seems to combine libertarian/anarchist views under a system that can actually enforce them in a way that isn't repugnant to those people that would normally find any enforcement as repugnant (or at least suspect). The problem is then you can use firestarter topics such as "free market" as a populist appeal to change the protocol. It's interesting to think about.

I completely agree, it's certainly within his right to not want to contribute to LN, that was never a question. I think Hearn and Schildbach contributed immensely! I don't think people have forgotten, at least not the ones that have been around since then. I'm enthusiastic about LN, but I can understand why they are not. That said, there's a reason rockets are staged and there's a reason networks are layered. This debate is really old (like before bitcoinj old), it just took a long time to boil over. I think it's important to note that fraud-proofs are going to become viable soon and the implementation of SPV wallets can be made significantly more robust. It's the nature of the software development game.

There actually was some poker code in the original bitcoin source code, but there was nothing implemented other than a few dialogs.

Any change will always involve some risk. There's also a risk of doing nothing. I've been over this several times over years with different people (for example discussion with Tim Swanson: 
My opinions have changed as I've learned more, and I do think a blocksize increase would be a good thing but leaving it unbounded or controlled by the miners is a very bad idea. Segwit is a blocksize increase despite what has been said though. I see it as a good first step and it can be used to measure what effects to the system a blocksize increase will have (perhaps more substantial) while also enabling things that we have desperately needed for years.

I'm 80% positive that Adam Back suggested precisely this modification to his scheme in a mailing list post, but I'm not going to dig through a lot of old posts to prove a troll wrong. Satoshi also use SHA256 instead if SHA1. For all we know, the reason that Satoshi emailed Back originally was to ask him to review. The fact that Back noticed that b-money and bitcoin were similar means he didn't just ignore satoshi and at least provided some cursory review. This means that Back is responsible for two of the citations in the white paper- his and Wei Dai's. 
Also should not that the original proof of work schemes are significantly different and could not be easily modified... plus hashcash existed in implemented code and was being used. I don't think any of the other ones were.

From his quote:


Meaning, even after he removed the command line switch, the mode would still be triggered if a longer invalid block chain were seen.


No. The miner would be on his own little network if he tried to change the consensus rules (as with a hardfork). Any blocks he tried to publish would not be relayed or built on by other miners. You can actually see that happen after the BIP66 activation. The only ones that would be affected would be lite wallets directly connected directly to that miners node and other miners that weren't doing their job of validating the blocks ("SPV mining"). You are right that the economy would take a nose dive though because it would signal that a non-idiot running that hashpower could do some rather nefarious things. A 51% miner still has to follow the network rules though.


No. They do not relay them, they ban the nodes that do relay them and they alert the node owner that something is happening that they don't like. Lite wallets connected to that node have no idea what's going on. A 51% attack miner is a lot of things, but they cannot change the rules without the approval of the economic important nodes (or "economic majority" though I've never really liked that term).


Rational miners will not switch unless they thing the economic majority is on board with the change. Any other change would spell disaster for the entire ecosystem. The problem is the miners do not have a perfect "signal" that the economic majority agrees with them, they can only act on what they know. If they misread or try to force through a change, then it will be disastrous for everyone involved. I'll happily sell all of my Bitcoin if that happens.

I believe was working on a cryptocurrency before lightning that had sharding set up, but I can't remember the details. I think I remember there being some technical challenges that he ran into, but not sure what.
Back in the olden days (1980-90's) there were online text-based games that were predecessors to MMORPGs called MOO/MUDs (Multi-user dungeons). Near the end of the era, some people were beginning to implement protocols where people could communicate between the different mud servers using an IRC like protocol (think it was called InterMUD). I sometimes wonder if this wasn't the beginning of what sparked the initial MMORPGs because it became clear to me, at least, that being connected to several hundred people as well as a few dozen in people in a "local layer" was a whole lot more fun than being "isolated." In fact, I was pretty addicted to MUDs at the time so when MMOs came around I was sure as hell not going to shoot that heroin up. 
So what does this have to do with LN and Sidechains (as well as similar protocols)? I think that connecting diverse and separate-but-united financial systems with different levels of accepted trade-offs is incredibly powerful and could spur an adoption rate similar to the 2010-2012 era of bitcoin. But we need a linchpin for that and it has to be really robust to support that. BU cannot be that linchpin, and at the moment I don't think Bitcoin is ready for that, but it has that potential.

The way to do this is to set up some sort of old-ripple-like or payment channel system, but unfortunately the work load is a bit much for a hobbyist with a full time job.

You're preaching to the choir. ;) Edit: Actually, I think analysis is even more optimistic than reality. This paper:  points out that mining isn't exactly a poisson process. I suspect that would make the hashing power percent required even lower than his analysis.

Well, to be fair the way they are planning the "trusted" setup is by using a multiparty computation where if only one of participants is honest then the setup should be confidential. So you have to only trust one person in that group of people.
It's important to note that zk-SNARKs and MPCs is bleeding edge cryptography, so there may be other problems that lurk. Still I believe it's a worthwhile exploration and personally feel any privacy and fungibility technology that *could* be secured should be explored.
That said, I believe that Bitcoin has the right parameters to succeed and zcash does not. I did build the zcash node and had fun making some python tools to create transactions and the like, but it was more just to get a preview of the technology. I wish Zooko luck, though. He's been a contributing cypherpunk for many years, something that satoshi even appreciated: 
Edit: just to add some Bitcoin relevant stuff.
I agree with Zooko that overconfidence is a problem. I believe that Satoshi had the same worries as well (see his reply to the wikileaks post). I personally have the same worries. There are cracks in the mortar that can be repaired now, but with increased load the repairs are going to be harder to perform and much more dangerous.

Good point. Still having physical control of the box is probably worth a little more. Really the high value nodes would be ones that transverse the great firewall and around other bottlenecks. Miner owned nodes are up there, too.
Honestly the quality of the node is probably correlated to the quality/responsibility of the operator. I'll have it give that some more thought.

My gut says... maybe. It's a coin that has less than million dollar market cap. Many could influence the price easily, so the price changes will not mean much. However, F2Pool runs a syscoin mining pool, so this may help get some of the technical questions out of the way for them.

LN is not hard on the server side. It's topology doesn't even have a server side, that's the point. It's more Bittorrent or Tor than client-server. Even a cursory glance at what they are doing tells you that.


That's not the whole point of LN, at all. It's a caching layer that benefits the network because you don't have to flood the entire network with your transaction to have similar assurances as Bitcoin offers.

First, mempools are not synced across all nodes - if we could accomplish that there would be no need for miners other than initial distribution of the currency. There is no **the** mempool. A node may manage **its** mempool however it likes (dropping transactions that it doesn't want to hold onto, only including transactions with the number 3 in it, not including any transactions at all in its mempool [blocksonly mode]). Nowadays, most nodes will not crash no matter how large the transaction backlog. **The** mempool (set of all transactions still valid, but never mined) does not exist anywhere, but if it did would likely be an order of magnitude larger than most sites have listed (it's also essentially unbounded, since as a individual you could create terabytes of transactions that would be valid, but would never be mined).

Then you do not understand. If you do not consider the blocksize a consensus parameter then you cannot consider coin generation a consensus parameter since they are enforced by the software run by the economic majority. If BU gets elected by the economic majority (not hashrate majoruty) then blocksize will no longer be a consensus parameter, but the same could be said about software that had a perpetual inflation model (eg a mythical bitcoin50forever fork).

From when this was posted on one of the other subs:


To the question:


I made this response:
I briefly mention some of the reasons in that same comment and unfortunately to explain all the points (and counterpoints) would probably take a few pages. I'll try to expand it a little though.
* It signals to any dissenting miners that they should adopt the Classic coin, rather than continue the SHA256 implementation of Core which would greatly reduce confusion and prevent any kind of "Yo-yo" hashrate effect as the markets begin to assign value between a Corecoin and a Classiccoin. It would also prevent miners from trying to "fake" consensus (publish blocks which seem to support classic, but then don't follow the crowd).
* It signals to pre-fork coin owners that they have a choice. This helps alleviate any discordance between the "economic majority" and "mining majority"  as well as extra-network influences (google Goldfinger attacks to understand what I'm talking about). I believe there is a significant difference between what miner's think is the economic majority and what actually is the economic majority.
* Some devs believe they are upholding a contract with the users. The way they seen it, the users have decided to accept another contract which could actually be quite freeing. Sure they could go work on Monero or Ethereum (or just leave), but now that they would more likely have consensus among themselves and they can rapidly implement changes that would have taken 6 months to a year to get deployed (in a backward compatible softfork kind of way).  If they do take this action, I would advocate that they do a **Omnibus hardfork** and put all the "wishlist" stuff they can agree on.
* Some devs (not sure how many) see the "writing on the wall" by continuing to use the same PoW for an extended period of time. Quite a few already believe that mining is already way too centralized (e.g. Luke Jr.). Changing PoW and working on a lower popularity coin will help alleviate those pressures until more robust solutions are found.
I could think of about dozen other reasons for and about 3 or 4 against. IDEALLY, what would happen is that dev, miner, users/economic consensus all converge on the same chain. That's still a strong possibility, too.
EDIT: Please note these are my speculation and opinions. I am regretting asking the question now (and then linking to it in another thread).

It's bizarre. Satoshi's own comments invalidate their interpretation. (I realize the irony, but read the rest of the comment).
"Safe mode can still be triggered by seeing a longer **(greater total PoW)** *invalid* block chain."
Emphasis mine. What's funny if you throw this out there, they will do flips to reconcile it with what they believe. It's the same "That's not the spirit of that scripture" response you get when talking religion. We should think for ourselves and evaluate the evidence, not follow blindly... Regardless if it's Satoshi or any other dev. If you don't have the technical or critical thinking skills to come up with an opinion don't get married to an idea when evidence to the contrary is presented.

Dear Core:
Please add UASF.
The economic majority
That's not how that would work and it shouldn't work like that. UASF is a community supported soft fork deployment mechanism which only should be run if it's what the economic majority wants. It is the letter. If it's successful then Core will also activate segwit as it was already coded. If it's unsuccessful then perhaps the economic majority never really supported segwit in its current implementation.
I won't run UASF for now, but I would really not like miners to attack its deployment.

I had a similar idea a little while ago. There's a couple problems with it though after I thought about it more. Still it might be interesting to flesh the idea out. 
I actually think hybrid UASF with a miner signalling activation closer to 50% would probably be as safe as a high percent miner signal rate activation (bip9).

I think we are discussing on very different levels. There's actually and interesting legal question here, that will eventually need to be answered by establishing case law. It's really orthogonal to Bitcoin itself, though. That said, GHash.io defrauded a dice site (can't remember which) ~6000 BTC without significant legal repercussions. In an open, worldwide, payment system using laws to enforce how the payment system should act is a recipe for trouble. Bitcoin is the epitome of accepting responsibility for actions - If you fail to implement it correctly, your bitcoins will be stolen.

I'll play out the rest of this thread:
* Someone will say, "Oh but X-thin blocks makes this no longer possible"
* Then another person will say "First of all Compact blocks (which X-thin's was stolen from) only works if miners aren't acting adversarially.
* Then there will be a reply along the lines that we can trust miners to do what maximizes their profits which is in line with they way bitcoin designed, and also X-thin implementation existed before compact blocks
* Then someone will say something like, well x-thin was buggy and didn't work when it was first implemented.
At this point, the thread is so deep no one but the two people arguing will know how it ends. ;)

*Strong SPV is much more theoretical and farther out than LN.*
The maths involved seem to have eluded us for a while. Satoshi left a "[Fermat's theorem]( in his paper even if he truly had a general solution. My guess is that he realized later that fraud proofs were much harder to truly implement when he started to approach the problem.
Edit: Actually, i think the Fermat's theorem is a perfect example... I suspect that Fermat also had a proof of his theorem which was incomplete.

The median time for a block is around 7 minutes (difficulty retargets to 10 minutes every 2016 blocks and since difficult usually uptrends, the median is shorter than 10). It's important to realize that blocks are produced following a Poisson distribution:
So occasionally a block gets produced 15, 20, 30 minutes after the previous one. So even if your transaction is included in the next block, it still not guaranteed to hit the blockchain in less than 10 minutes.
Fun fact: Block 0 and Block 1 were separated by 128 hours, 19 minutes and 20 seconds.

It does look like an immune reaction is forming to these things... hope it's enough and I hope it doesn't cause the pendulum to swing too far in the other direction. I'm hoping people realize that we should only move forward with the widest possible support and should favor permissionless changes and innovation (non-protocol changes + layered changes &gt; node policy &gt; noncontentious softforks &gt; noncontentious hardforks &gt; contentious softforks &gt; contentious hardforks). Rule changes which require a significant amount of political dealing are bad for **everyone** since they undermine the very thing that Bitcoin was designed to eliminate (I am not saying that we it should be never done, though).
It's not one party that's doing this... there's a lot of parties involved. Buttcoiners + MP + R3 + Eth users + Monero + Dash users + Classic shills + Core Shills + Useful idiots. Trying to reduce it to two sides of a debate automatically means you'll be wrong.

Good, beautiful, code... your code. How would that make you feel?
Now imagine you are a horse carriage maker...
The question is: if LN does develop to the point where it's useful and desired, when should the industry start jumping on? I don't have a good answer, but I welcome the future. It's funny institutional inertia is already present in the Bitcoin space even though it's so young.

I won't go into all details of this, but they both deserve high praise for the work that they've done to advance the freedoms we (currently) enjoy on the internet. That's one big reason I give Blockstream the benefit of the doubt when it comes to all the crazy conspiracy theories that come out about them.

Strongly agree. Appealing to a vision is even worse than appealing to authority, because that authority can't even reinforce or rephrase what they meant based on current events. That said, all sides of this debate have resorted to appealing to Satoshi's vision (theymos's response in other threads and Hearn's repeated medium posts). It's not the right way to handle it. So I will try to formulate an argument without resorting to too much appeal to authority:
As a thought experiment, imagine if numerous competing implementations with different activation thresholds existed on the network (Classic, XT, Unlimited, Ultra (jk), foo1, foo2, bar1, bar2). At what point do you say "we can allow discussion on Classic, but not foo1 and foo2?" Additionally, multiple implementations will begin to compete on lower activation thresholds (foo1 only needs 66% mining consensus to activate, etc.). Regarding moderation policy, I believe the correct option is to make a rule, make it consistent and get it over with it. If the majority are upset then they are free to work on making a better forum.
To me, Bitcoin as a protocol is meant to be nearly tyrannical. Our freedoms come out of ceding governance to the "ghost in the machine" except in situations where it's clearly broken - only then, by overwhelming consensus, should it be changed.
I've owned bitcoin and followed it's development for quite a while. The influx of new users in the last 2-3 years has diluted some of the values that allowed Bitcoin to get where it is in the first place. We aren't Liberty dollar, Digicash or E-Gold because of those value.  Increased visibility doesn't make us more protected, just more likely to be co-opted (Embrace, Extend, Extinguish). Sure I want my Bitcoin to be worth $100,000 a coin, but I also want those $100,000 coins to be Bitcoin at the end of it. To me Bitcoin means immutability and fungibility (frankly Bitcoin falls well short of this, but can be improved hopefully with consensus). We are heading towards a cashless society at breakneck speed. Governments have become increasingly willing to infringe on freedoms based on imperceptible crimes. Operation Choke Point is the tip of the iceberg and I believe it will be the de facto way money is viewed in our society. It may even become a majority view. That does not mean it's the correct one.
Our hardware has been compromised (Juniper), our software has been compromised (OpenSSL/Truecrypt, whether intentional or not), and our freedoms are being compromised. Don't compromise Bitcoin to compete with Paypal. We need consensus and if it can not be achieved honestly, then the honest thing to do is to start an altcoin.

The filing says coin with most hashing power, which makes almost no sense. If there is ever a POW change, you can't compare the forks with different POW algos head-to-head like that, energy expenditure would be a closer guage (but would be difficult to measure). Additionally, in the case with an unstable oscillating hashrate in setting of a HF with the same POW on both coins it could be difficult to determine which is the "real" fork. What should be done is that both coins should be included in the ETF or one coin should be sold and provided as a dividend. My understanding is that there's some regulatory stuff in the way that makes the situation difficult to handle. It's one of my major concerns with the ETF.
We should always be wary of extranetwork influence on Bitcoin. In this case, I don't think the ETF will have as much power to exert influence early on, but you certainly have a legitimate thought.

Sorry the metaphor wasn't 1:1. What Greg is trying to do is keep the design close to the third panel and as far away as possible from the final panel. Just a few "minor" changes starts with 2MB. But what does that give, an extra 3-7 tps? That's not even a order of magnitude difference in the transaction throughput. Well we can fix that: Let's go to 8MB or 16MB in a year, I'm sure our networks will be able to support that later on (Moore's law! yay!). The problem, which 90% of the devs who have contributed to the real infrastructural underpinnings of Bitcoin realize is that the blocksize increases do not scale the way the general user base of Bitcoin thinks they do. This is exacerbated by "experts" that are knowingly or unknowingly misleading people into believing that these devs are mistaken. Let me tell you in no uncertain terms: they are not mistaken. **That doesn't mean a blocksize increase should be off the table.** The trade offs for a marginal increase in the blocksize are reasonable, but there is going to be an economic change event that occurs sooner or later no matter what blocksize is chosen. The only way that it cannot occur is if Bitcoin starts to become not-Bitcoin and begins to trade-off decentralization. One early step to making Bitcoin not-Bitcoin is to fire the people that have resisted the changes that people have asked for for years. People ask for stupid changes to Bitcoin all the time. What people are doing is begging the devs to break a prior social contract that they have already made.

I don't think that quite gets the meaning across. It's a consensus client which has the *potential* to fork if a condition is met. Perhaps a situation-coin (sit-coin)? I was going to say condition-coin, but that would shorten to (con-coin). Hmm, preposition-coin (prep-coin)?

The whole point is that it's stupid to argue with this kind of stuff. Let me show you the argument against what you said:
If you want the context, you're going to have to read the entire thread including the comments that he made in the other threads at around the same time. If you do that (and also time it with when he added the 1 MB blocksize limit as well as disagreed with jgarzik removing it), you realize that the content of his actions are against introducing contentious hardforks.
What he is saying in that quote goes even further: even in the setting of a compatible implementation... a single tiny bit difference in how DER encoding is handled or a unrealized bug will cause an *unintentional* hardfork. He's trying to point that out, and he says he doesn't even want to talk about it because the discussion would probably fill several pages and... being Satoshi... he rarely speaks longer than a few sentences.

I believe the CONOP metric which Paul Sztorc put out is probably the best illustration. My feeling is that CONOP ~= cost that an individual is able to reasonably host a node on a median internet connection with a median general purpose computer. Any CONOP increase which requires significant infrastructural upgrade (moving to a faster internet connection with a more liberal bandwidth cap, upgrading a computer past what a general consumer would use, etc.) is a deleterious.

Self interest is perspective based. A heroin user acting in his own self interest continues to use heroin. A heroin user getting clean and working out every day is acting in his own self interest. These statements are not in contradiction.
Bitcoin relies on honesty of the hash weighted majority and they do have incentives to stay honest, but those incentives only exist if Bitcoin the network isn't completely under their control. We do not want the MPAA running the only Bittorrent seeds and we do not want the miners running the only Bitcoin nodes.

It surely does happen on both "sides" (I hate even saying that). Using a moral equivalence argument is not helpful in these debates. It should not be tolerated on either "side." If it exists in this specific post, which I think is a high likelihood of being true, then it shouldn't be tolerated. Unfortunately, reddit admins (due to ignorance, laziness, or indifference) or the moderators (due to not having the correct tools to combat it or willingness to let one agenda have freer-range under the rules) have really caused quality as a whole to decline - regardless of subreddit.

inb4 someone mentions quantum entanglement - it probably doesn't allow FTL communication. There's all sorts of weird paradoxes that arise from breaking the speed of light. 
I've always thought it would be a fun idea to have a rover (say one that lands on Europa) generate a public address from it's own RNG and not allow communication of the private key (essentially initialize a hardware wallet on a different planet). Then the spacecraft could communicate it's public key to Earth and people could send a few bucks to the spacecraft. This would set up a spacecache/bounty to whoever could retrieve it.
For long-distance communications, I think sidechains or the LN (or payment channel) would probably be the best for a mars colony. Another interesting thing would be what would happen if a mining majority was set up on mars -&gt; it would effectively end all mining on Earth (unless the earthicans changed their proof of work) -- it would put the great firewall to shame.

Why is he talking about disk space at all when trying to produce a collision? Just use a GPU/cycle finding algo (you'll have to be smart enough to implement it for the purpose) and grind away... you don't have to store any non-colliding transactions.

I think it's important to point out that the Bitcoin software had "limits" that were kind of like suggestions before the "hard limit" of 1 MB was met. I believe they were at 250kb, then 500kb (best illustration of this is Organ of Corti's heat map:  Also early nodes (that were also miners) had "thresholds" coded in them. Not many people were that developed in their understanding of what Satoshi was doing at the time, so he was able to get away with these "suggestions" early on (he actually asked for temporary moriatorium on GPU miners as well, which I'm pretty sure those miners ignored). See here: 
I think it's important not to read into Satoshi's vision things that may not be there. I've personally read through every single post of Satoshi's including bitcointalk, the crypto mailing list, the mailing lists archived on sourceforge. His ideas changed throughout the development of Bitcoin. For example, two days before he stopped publically posting: "Piling every proof-of-work quorum system in the world into one dataset doesn't scale." something that I don't think he would have stated early on.

It's around a third of the way in "Rise and Rise of Bitcoin." I don't know where it's free online - I know it's on hulu. Here's the quote (I transcribed):


Over time, I think Satoshi learned to trust me. He could see that I didn't make very many stupid mistakes. I never had any personal connection with Satoshi. It was always purely business. And I think that's because he was so worried about people finding out his identity. I don't know why [satoshi decided to leave]. My last email to him was telling him that I had agreed to go visit the folks at the CIA, so... [laugh] whether that had something to do with him deciding to cut off communication with me entirely. He had been pulling away before then, but the CIA invited me to come talk at the CIA and I agreed to do that.

Good. My approach is like this for completely naive (but very interested):
* Explain the double spend problem.
* Explain what ledgers are (it's amazing how many people don't understand them).
* Make the analogy between physical ledgers and the blockchain.
* Make an analogy between a central bank's ability to "create" money and the bitcoins the bookkeepers's receive for adding to the ledger. It's not important to invoke proof-of-work unless somebody asks how it's decided who gets the money... then just launch into a quick "magic math" discussion.

There's actually a few of this magnitude I can think of, but the errors made were significantly more forgivable. This error is something that should have been caught.
By forgivable, I mean the bugs were triggered or could have been triggered in a way that would cause a similar reaction (the nondeterministic behavior prior to BIP66 which was never exploited, thankfully), but were things that a very experienced coder could have understood how it would have been overlooked (the actual bug itself wasn't in the Bitcoin code base, but OpenSSL). The code change that cause this bug is like removing a guard on an angle grinder to "save weight."

The two separate utxos is completely wrong even with the softfork. It's hard to believe anyone technical can say it without doing it to deliberately mislead. I suppose you could make severe mental contortions to make it true, but it has no consequence and any hard fork version of segwit would still have to maintain the "preSW" utxo set otherwise it would render old style outputs unspendable. 
@_date: 2017-01-12 06:38:09
Yes. Node operators get to choose what fee they will charge and "senders" will agree to the fee upfront. The fee delivery is kind of hard for me to explain, because it really depends on what you mean by delivery. Suffice to say after the channel is closed the intermediate node will have a small portion of the total that was sent through the network of channels. Except the idea is that most channels will stay open for a long time. 
Think of the LN like you would the internet. You don't have a physical wire connecting you to every other person on the network, but just as long as a suitable route exists between the payee and payor no other channels need to be opened. Ideally each node will be have multiple open channels and you get a truly decentralized network. What truly is going to happen remains to be seen, but I do think people like Rusty Russell (check his Wikipedia page) and roasbeef know what they are doing.
I kind of want to make a physical demo of the lightning network with a series of hydraulics, valves, and taps to explain how it works. If you think of channels as fluid filled cylinders with plungers moving it makes it a little easier to understand. Well at least for me.

* Make nodes easier to run. 
* Make the built in wallet software better.
I believe 0.12 was a significant improvement in the speed in the system and we should start to see an uptick once the wallet code has HD wallet support (coming eventually) and can switch between a light wallet and full node gracefully. I actually stopped running a (24 hr) node somewhere around 0.8 and just started when 0.12 was released.
In 2011, there were something like 20k nodes on the network due to the fact that wallet choice was much more limited and mining was more distributed (sync times and resource requirements were much smaller - typical blocks in those days were &lt; 100 kb). 
For now we have to rely on altruism, enthusiasm, or business needs to support the network nodes. Unfortunately altruism only works if the resource costs per node are negligible. 
Edit: Also important to note. Really the number of nodes does not illustrate network health, but for your purpose it's more important to run your node than anyone else running theirs. 
* "The only node that matters is yours." 
* "You're not using bitcoin if you don't run a full node."
These are rather aggressive ways of making that point. I don't completely agree with those quotes, but I think the people that mock them actually are missing a big part when it comes to understanding what Bitcoin is. One day... some day... we'll have fraud proofs and then more people will be using Bitcoin without having to run a full node. 
@_date: 2016-06-29 03:58:38
Hint: When people say things like "'I've seen a number of people [say X]" or "Numerous people from [X] have directly told me" your next question should be "Who?" If you can't answer it yourself, then you should ask the author specifically who they mean. Let's try it:


Who? If you mean Luke-Jr or Greg Maxwell, then you are completely misrepresenting their point. If you mean, someone else I profoundly apologize. Their (GM/LJ) point usually goes along the lines of this: "The demand for a globally available, consistent database and for storage of information [whether it be of economic value or not] is always in high demand, and therefore no matter the size of the block it will always be full." This pretty much says the opposite of the what Ver is saying, yet if you look at the arguments superficially they look similar. 
* Blocks should always be full
* Blocks will always be full
Now of course, the second cannot be true because you can think of absurd situations where blocks could potentially be 8 GB and very few nodes or miners could provide useful services at that high of a bandwidth.


Then don't.


OK. Emphasis is mine. Does he mean to imply that every single small block proponent is ignorant on economic subjects? I highly doubt that. I read a study about a year ago that I think nails a big portion of the problem down, here is the quote (h/t Szabo's twitter. source:  [warning: PDF]):


in the blocks themselves? The reason is the following. When a miner tries to solve a block,
the transactions are already in the network. In this case, he is a Stackelberg follower and
he has an incentive to include all transactions in the limitless block he tries to solve. He
could announce before solving a block that if he indeed solves a block, he will not include
all transactions. But this announcement would not be credible. Indeed, since miners
are in competition with distributed hashing power, the transactions a miner would not
include would certainly be included just ten minutes later by another miner. **Including all
transactions whatever the fee attached is the only subgame perfect Nash equilibrium of
the game we described.**
Emphasis mine again. The author is a PhD Economist. It's important to note that this paper is a bit of simplification of the system. In fact, Peter Rizun wrote a paper where he points out that fear of orphaning pressure (among other things) provides miners a natural incentive to limit the size of blocks (something of which Bitcoin Unlimited has taken and run with). Things that miners already take advantage of seem to break the underlying assumptions of Peter R's paper, though.
Another person who often argues from economic standpoints is Paul Sztorc who has a masters in statistics (also "Worked directly under [William Nordhaus]( as a member of a research team to provide appropriate
statistical input in the design, execution and analysis of studies concerning macroeconomic research." according to his LinkedIn), but seems to have arrived a "small blockist" viewpoint. His "Measuring Decentralization" post is a pretty good read (CONOP is a particularly useful idea to understand, and does quite a good job of addressing the negative externalities of a large blocksize): 
Another argument from Ver's article:


In June 2011, Gavin Andresen gave a presentation to the CIA regarding Bitcoin. Here is a copy of it 


This was 5 years ago. The amount of Bitcoin adoption at that time was probable ~1% of the adoption that we have now, yet then there were 20 to 30,000 nodes on the network. In 5 years, we have nearly increased adoption 100-fold, yet we have 1/4 the number of validating full nodes on the network. At that time there were few choices in software, but there were some. I know because I was there. I do not think it's right to expect businesses like Coinbase, Bitpay, et al to run nodes because we have seen examples of large Bitcoin business that **DID NOT** run bitcoin nodes due to technical and economic reasons.  I also remember there came a time when I turned off my full node because it was too taxing on my network, disk, and hindered my general purpose PC enough that I would routinely stop the node before starting a game. Eventually I turned it off for years (I have since started running a full note again - directly as a result of advancements made possible by the likes of Pieter Wuille and Hal Finney). 
Sorry for the wall of text, please excuse typographical and grammatical errors... I'll try to recompose this at later time to make it a bit more coherent.
I will point out that I'm not a small 1 MB block proponent. I think that a reasonable increase as long as there is a degree of safety is OK. The problem is what is "reasonable" - I don't think the science from either a technical or an economic point has advanced enough to answer that question. I suspect that a flexible limit with some sort of anti-gaming mechanism has to be employed. From an empiric standpoint, I think we are well on the way to understanding a little bit more because SegWit will necessarily tax the P2P network more.

Probably mid-2013 was when raspberry pi mining started coming into use (I remember running a RPi miner with some avalon hardware around that time) everything else you said is accurate (Raspberry pi wasn't even released until 2012). BTW, almost all Raspi miners did not run a node. cgminer did not need a full node to run unless you were solo-mining in which case you would probably be using a desktop.

Don't misunderstand the comment. I completely agree with that. POW has its purpose though and being resistant to Sybil attacks is that purpose. A well resourced attacker with knowledge you only have one connection to the network could potentially use that to make you think a transaction is confirmed when it actually isn't or vice versa. Obviously thats so little to worry about with this method, but it's important to be explicitly clear what can happen (even if it's exceedingly unlikely to happen).

No, I'd import into another type of Bitcoin wallet. If you have a android phone I'd suggest Mycelium or use a wallet you prefer. Best would be Bitcoin Core, but most people don't have a node synced up and ready.
OR read my edit: 


Then, create a new transaction (but be sure to increase the fee) and resend it (your fee should be ~ 0.0003 BTC for that size transaction to get into the next block or two).

Other people that want to sell them. All bitcoins initially come from miners. Most people obtain their bitcoins from exchanges. Miners sell their coins to cover running expenses (or HODL them and carry risk) and I would bet a large amount is just put directly on the exchanges. Some mining pools also have their own exchanges which they use (see BTCC). I used to keep track of it a little bit, but Coinbase and the like used to have deals with mining pools to sell to them. There's also "dark liquidity" out there if you want to buy a lot of them.

Not to worry. You didn't lose coins. The transactions fees were on the small side, and it probably never propagated through the network... and thus the transaction will (probably) never be confirmed.
I can't remember how to do it in Multibit, but there should be a way to "forget" recent unconfirmed transactions. Otherwise, there should be a way to export the private key and "sweep" it using more modern software into another address.
Edit: 
Please note, don't share those private keys with anyone, or your Bitcoins WILL be stolen.

You're welcome. BTW, the fee it chose for that transaction works out to be about 50 satoshis/byte, which according to  should confirm in &lt; 7 blocks. So don't get frustrated if it doesn't get confirmed in the next block. Just give it some time.
@_date: 2017-01-20 00:52:41

Those numbers are crazy because they are not true. At least not in a modern hospital setting. I see illicit drug deaths every month. I see a fatal ADR maybe three times a year, in patients that are already critically ill for other reasons. Healthy people very rarely die from ADRs... especially in a setting that has near immediate access to epinephrine and mechanical ventilation. That meta-analysis had horrible methodology and is off by at least an order of magnitude (it's also using data that's over 20 years old now).
I'm saying this all because it's bad data... not because I'm a fan of the FDA. I think they need to be severely curtailed... but not because of this. Because their policies have repeatedly been shown to increase drug costs for patients.

Restarting your computer won't fix it. That old multibit software was created when most any transaction produced would eventually be confirmed. You have to figure out a way to make it "forget" it's recent transactions, which I can't remember enough about the software to remember how to do. Alternatively, just export the private keys and import/sweep them into another wallet that's more modern (see my link above).
Edit: Here's from their site:


@_date: 2017-01-20 00:45:37
This, unfortunately, isn't enough info. The amount of bitcoins sent doesn't really have anything to do with the transaction size, the number of inputs to make the transaction does. So if your wallet is filled with a lot of small transactions, then the size of the transaction to consolidate them into another wallet is going to be more. If you can preview a transaction's size in blockchain.info before sending it (I don't remember if that's possible), it will probably tell you the byte size. Then cancel that transaction and calculate the fee based on that. It's been a couple years since I used blockchain.info, so I don't know if that's possible.

The whole point of the merge is to get more review. Think of it like phased drug trials. 
* Phase 1: Somebody write the code in their individual repo and regtests it.
* Phase 2: Submit a pull request to the main repo. Depending on importance, experts test it and try to break it, fix code nits, find bugs, and fix and fix. Run on testnets if it's consensus changes, etc.
* Phase 3: Merge pull request. More people that aren't pros (like me) build it and see if anything breaks. Abuse it on testnet.
* **Edit** Phase 3.5: Binary releases are made. It is still not deployed on mainnet, but people can use it on testnet easily.
* Phase 4. Define softfork deployment a la BIP9, allow miners to signal readiness.

Ripple was talked about before bitcoin, but wasn't developed. The original idea of ripple was quite a bit different than what the name is now attached to. 
Edit. Also regarding gpus, FPGAs, Asics... that's a little more suspect, but based on things I've read from Satoshi it seemed like he was very much a hardware guy (he uses terms that an ECE or EE grad would use and even early in development he was making optimizations and things that would imply strong understanding of lower level stuff)... and I strongly suspect that he would be aware that gpus and ASICs would be down the line some time. Of course these emails could be fakes too, but I wouldn't immediately discount them.

This was during one of the bubbles and he was going to use cubesats... which are not geosynchronous and the bandwidth they provide with their power required would have been pretty close to the limit a cubesat could provide.  It was a cool project and I wish it would have taken shape, but this method is cheaper for the ground user and more reliable. Only benefit of cubesats really is latency since the are in a much closer (also decaying) orbit.

Even though I don't agree with everything Armstrong says, Coinbase is a part of the Bitcoin ecosystem and his opinion (like all of ours) is important in as much as he is a participant in the system. Just keep a mental note of his actions, don't use his product unless you want to and be happy to agree with him on this aspect.

Good on you for not just taking my word. 
I just googled if you could change fees in that version of multibit and it seems there isn't (could be wrong, I'm not going to reinstall it). That means any transaction you try to make with it is going to run into the same problem (too low fees), which means trying again is likely to fail again. Multibit HD allows you to change fees if I recall correctly. Electrum would too. I'm trying to be deliberately vague. Each option has pluses and minuses. You need a modern, up-to-date wallet with the ability to "sweep" private keys. 
@_date: 2017-01-20 02:17:58
So electrum is probably your answer. The sweep tool should work for your purposes.

None of which will keep the US Government from garnishing or seizing Bitcoin from its citizens by leveraging coinbase/gemini with legal threats. Agree that coinbase is unlikely to lose due to hacking, but much more likely due to other things. The IRS order is proof of that. Gold seizures in the US is proof of that. 
If you don't have the technical ability to hold Bitcoin then don't buy Bitcoin. Holding your coins on Coinbase just means your more likely to be phished for your coins. If you are smart enough to set up two factor and secure your email address you are smart enough to have custody of your coins (after doing a bit of research).

So this will make it so people can participate easier with testing (they just need to build the master branch and run on testnet). The next step will be defining the when to actually start the deployment on mainnet. This softfork code will probably happen in 0.13.1 or .2, I would guess.

Money in support of development is great and I applaud Ver for all the work he has done to contribute capital to the Bitcoin ecosystem, but sometimes money can be more damaging than beneficial. I believe the meme of Core being a single group of well-coordinated exact-in-mind developers that have a stranglehold on development is extraordinarily harmful to the ecosystem. I see this letter advancing that meme. Ostensibly this money is one milllion bucks for Bitcoin development, but will it actually be used in a way that's beneficial? I've seen way too many broken promises when it comes to this. When the money is spent and it's actually spent on things that came to benefit the ecosystem I'll reconsider my position on this.

The same 5 or 6 "devs" bounce from XT to Classic to BU to btc1 and now 2X.

This kind if technology makes being anonymous on the network layer much easier. A satellite blasts data through a coverage area, but it has no idea where or who the people are that are receiving that data are located.
Agreed a single company doing this is a little worrisome, but it's only really problematic if they are willing to throw some hashrate behind it. You have a node on the ground too and it's going to reject invalid blocks anyway. If you are running a different node that actually is doing it's job it's going to stop as soon as it gets sent an invalid block. The only worry you have is blockstream sending you a lower total POW chain while passing it off as the higher one, something that is pretty costly to do and would be immediately detectable by anyone running a node connected to multiple sources. Can you imagine the fallout if someone noticed that the satellite was broadcasting a lower total POW chain?

The only way to trigger the situation is if somebody already mucked with wallet code enough to break the belt (the suspenders stays in place).

There's several reasons not to just import a key into a wallet and use it. First, in a HD wallet structure that address won't be part of the hierarchy and therefore backing up with the "words" won't save that address. Second, if you are importing a key into a wallet that means by necessity it came from somewhere else which may not be secure anymore. Like in this case, this guy is probably using the copy/paste function on his computer. If he forgot to clear his clipboard, the privkey is just sitting there for a malware or the next user to steal. Or you import from a paper wallet and you throw the paper wallet away and then evil trash man sees it and correctly sweeps the coins.

I like the direction that you're taking with the wallet and the things your working on. I was just upset that this document was being emailed about and AFAIK (and so far) few of the core devs were asked to sign it despite the document saying things that few people in the Bitcoin community would disagree with. 
I certainly don't disagree with it, though I do think it's kind of generic. and both have big problems... The admins do not give the mods the correct tools to do their job effectively and are unwilling/unable to do it themselves. I've been here for years. I remember when there were posts on that were to effect "BUY BITCO1N 10BTC $20" that were regularly upvoted to the front page, before an automoderator was even being used (actually I remember when a new post would always be on the frontpage since the content churn was so small). I was here when every single front page post was on XT -&gt; which resulted in a mass deletion and then tightening down on rules of what could be posted. I think BashCo has been pretty upfront with the errors the mods made during that time and I believe they are still suffering the consequences. The moderators are given a thankless job... just look at - he seemed to be an effective moderator at and and I'm not sure who hates him the most. In the end the threshold between what's censorship and moderation get pretty blurry and just like a public school system zero-tolerance policies start to be enforced which results in people with plastic forks getting punished just the same as the people with machetes. If reddit admins could have given the mods the proper tools a lot of this could have been avoided.
That said, I think it's important to separate theymos from the core devs and I don't like issues being conflated (which I think the scaling debate has been conflated heavily with the moderation debate). It reeks of a proxy war. 
So in the end, I'll probably still use your companies software (especially if everyone that wants is given a change to be a signatory), I was just fuming because I'm disappointed that these escalations continue to occur.

The bandwidth (er.. baudrate) is not really there. 9600 bps is typical for packet radio that amateurs use. There are faster systems that hams use but they are higher frequency and line of sight which makes them only available reliably in densely populated areas. Satellite is the best way to get this done. The cool thing is that coupling this with Sms or packet radio allows you to send transactions and see that they confirm with the satellite.
The setup is not that hard for a power user and it would be pretty easy once someone takes the time to get a kit together. 100 is high estimate... a use Ku band dish and a SDR is... really dirt cheap.

Almost every answer in here is ~~wrong or~~ too simplified (luke-jr and pb1x answers are correct, but incomplete), because the long answer is pretty difficult to explain the nuances of.
Let's try a thought experiment. Let's say we have 5 non-mining nodes and 3 miners (mining nodes) in the entire system. Non-mining Node  has 90% of the Bitcoins (as soon as the miners produces bitcoin, this node owner buys 90% of the production with a commodity or another currency that the miners are poor in, with the rest of the nodes buying the other 10%). Non-mining Node  has 10% of the coins and node 3-5 have no coins.
Now node  happens to be a small island country which is using the Bitcoins as a reserve currency and printing a currency backed by the country and ostensibly the Bitcoin. There's a few thousand people that use this fiat currency and at any time (hopefully) they can present the currency and get their proportion of Bitcoin their country owns. 
Now node  who has 10% of the currency thinks up a rule that it wants enforced which states: 
All public addresses which happened to be owned by node  are from now on unspendable. Node 2 happens to be buddies with 2 of the 3 miners and they happily go along with a softfork (protocol restriction) making those unspendable. Node 2 also gets nodes 3-5 on his side, too. The question is did he win (he now has all the spendable bitcoins, backed by the highest hash rate and every other node on the network)?

Downvotes on don't really obscure anything. Comments don't get collapsed and you can't see vote totals for about 8 hours. The only thing that would change is the order of the children, but your comment has no siblings at the moment.
I think Satoshi would have been fine with bigger blocks, but he would have wanted users [to pay for them]( Unfortunately, there's some interesting economic and technical concerns that happen as blocks get larger that Satoshi was probably aware of (at least somewhat), but never wrote much of anything about (especially public). I suspect because he didn't want to give griefers ammunition.
In fact, this is what theymos told me:

Nullc is a Bitcoin developer that does a lot of cryptographic work involved with Bitcoin. He also posts to reddit a lot. A couple of days ago he was banned site-wide on reddit which is an admin action. There's no real information for why he was banned, but I think it probably had to do with a couple posts that he made on the other subreddit that listed another dev's email address (despite it being well known public knowledge) which started an argument with a moderator there about what constitutes doxxing. At some point in this argument, nullc mentioned the real name of a person that was involved in the Hastfast fiasco. This person used to be a rather prolific poster on bitcointalk and reddit, but disappeared... probably because his real livelihood was getting too woven into Bitcoin politics. I would bet that either the mods at the other subreddit contacted the admins or that person (who-shall-not-be-named) contacted reddit admins himself. Now the ban has been lifted. We could speculate why (and there's plenty of that already in this thread), but in the end he's back.

Personality disorders abound and some people have significantly different motivations than seeing bitcoin as a success. They want a modicum of control on what could be one of the most powerful technologies since the internet. Argue on merit. Don't be afraid to disagree with or cast aside your prior heroes, but at the same time if you don't agree with their position try to understand their motivations. Bitcoin helps increase positive social scalability without a lot of the negative side effects that happen in other systems of money, but it's not impervious.
My overriding belief in how bitcoin should progress is that updates should primarily be in reducing control of any one entity. Including devs, miners, and economic participants that have their own ideas if what Bitcoin should be. The perfect bitcoin would be a perfect trusted black box that can never be destroyed, allows immutable transfers to and from any entity, is traceable and verifiable when desired and anonymous when it's not (and the interchange between the two modes is seemless), and safe and easy to use for the most downtrodden.
We don't have that ideal yet, but we should keep it in mind when we are evaluating ideas. Things like MAST, Schnorr, mimblewimble and other technologies get us closer. Increasing node overhead and concentrating bitcoin in the crypto equivalent of banks/custodians gets us further away. Hardware wallets get us closer (with the added benefit of working towards open hardware which we are severely lacking).
Point is that some people want power other people want to give bitcoin the power...

This only has a peripheral importance to Bitcoin and I haven't read the whole article yet (just scanned), but I do think it's important to understand just how much risk mitigation plays a role in Bitcoin (and any cryptocurrency). In this case, Todd had to perform extreme risk mitigation because if he and five others are compromised zcash will forever and always be compromised (unless they start with a new trusted setup). Interesting to see what lengths he goes through.

Payment channels are simplistic enough to understand because there aren't a lot of unaccounted for externalities. LN doesn't have that. It's too complicated to figure out on the back of a napkin. I think for that reason the best guesses on what will and won't work are just that... guesses. I do have a lot a hope for it though.
I agree with Poon on that particular prototype not being LN in the truest sense. I haven't looked into the backend of streamium, so I'm not 100% sure they've implemented payment channels completely yet. The fact that I've heard a few streamers say their money disappeared due to a browser session bug means their implementation needs work.

Side chains are an interesting concept that came out of a few problems that keep occurring in the cryptocurrency space. Let me start with a background on altcoins.
Altcoins have good and bad things associated with them. For the most part, they are clones of Bitcoin with almost no new innovation associated with them. Early cryptocurrency history is littered with the corpses of hundreds of them. Many were little more than pump-and-dumps that the developer cashed out of early leaving a lot of users holding a bunch of worthless coins. Some of them the devs just kind of moved on to other projects and let them dwindle away. Occasionally one would come along with something a little bit different and they survived. For example Tenebrix used a different hash function, though configured wrong, that was a little harder to get running on GPUs and ASICs. Another coin has a really cute mascot. Another uses a different signature scheme that makes it more private. Another is the best thing since sliced bread (according to the developers). Another is Turing complete and apparently will become a benevolent Skynet.
The problem with all these developments is that they may take network effect from Bitcoin (the one true cryptocurrency, praise be to Satoshi). They probably won't overcome Bitcoin, but it causes onlookers (and potential users) to ask, "Why would I buy Bitcoin, when X-coin is very similar and looks better in a lot of ways? Actually, why would I buy any cryptocurrency at all when they can be made cloned infinitely and therefore they are all worthless. Maybe I should wait a little longer so I know which one will be the winner. Screw this! I'll just buy some more candy crush gold." Additionally, for a novice it was really hard to evaluate if a claim by some shady developer was actually true or not.
Sidechains address this by saying: what if I made it possible to trade Bitcoin for an Altcoin, but be pretty sure that I can get my Bitcoin back after I'm done "trying out" that coin? It works by "pegging" the currency to Bitcoin in a predictable way. Most common peg would be a two way peg (1 bitcoin = 1 sidechain coin or some other fixed ratio). Other pegs could exist, but it's hard to think of an actual use for them. A side chain may have any number of benefits over Bitcoin, for example it could have a special use case (small signatures) or a different privacy method, etc. It could be a test bed for a new cryptographic concept that's too new to put into Bitcoin, but may be better if the cryptography works out in the future. It makes it easier for developers to test their concepts "live" rather than having to "boot" up a new currency (altcoin) to support it.
There's a few disadvantages - right now there's no way to use the real Bitcoin to actually make a two-way peg in a that was trustless. The "code" isn't in Bitcoin to do it yet, although there's some hand wavy ways to get it done. IMO, in order for it to work the two-way peg crypto has to be pretty rock solid. 
There's all sorts of weird things that could happen and it's really very possible that the best applications haven't even been thought of. For example, let's say there turns out to be some trustless, decentralized consensus method that turns out to be infinitely better than POW/Blockchains which is discovered in the future. Let's say it's based on some sort of quantum phenomenon that makes it easy to enforce a consensus. All of a sudden, all the POW mining and other shit we have been doing turns out to be useless work. How would we translate the economy over into the new system... conceivably you could use a side chain to migrate everyone's value over to the new system (essentially abandoning the once innovative Bitcoin). I expect this will happen about the time we get our first Dyson sphere up and running. ;)

I agree with you, in a few years. This isn't a few years. Go over to github.com/bitcoinxt and count the number of contributors.
With regards to your game programming analogy, there's only so many John Carmack's in the world. How long do you think it would have been before we figured out the use of BSP trees as an optimization for 3d rendering without him? We could be 5 years behind where we are now if not for that one man's contributions to the gaming industry.
The fact that it took 20 years at least to produce a viable (maybe?) decentralized system like Bitcoin, despite the best minds in the field searching (See Wei Dai, Hal Finney, Szabo, and pretty much every cypherpunk) means that Bitcoin was non-obvious. I've watched numerous developers and academics throw pejoratives and weak papers (see Shamir's papers on the subject) at Bitcoin... and these were the devs that persevered in that environment.

You're right, I overlooked that factor (as well as others I'm sure).
Honestly I think it was a mistake for Bitcoin core not to add HD wallets (or the option to). There were people (including me if I look back in my post history) discouraging use of bitcoin-qt... but I usually recommended Armory as an alternative (or additional) option back then as well, which I still think was the better choice over electrum for the power user.

I'd actually prefer they did that with the block coinbase reward, too (smooth changes down rather than abrupt halving). My preference illustrates one of the dangers of having multiple hardforks... I'd never get a consensus with that suggestion, even though I think it would be superior, because I can think of a good argument against it. All that needs to block consensus is one good argument or meme. Hence, I would never seriously suggest it because if it did cause a significant minority to campaign for it then that would probably be more detrimental to the ecosystem.

I agree they should state clearly that they have a conflict of interest and it's a little disheartening that they don't (edit: see below). I'll be happy to state mine: I own Bitcoin. I want Bitcoin to succeed, but I don't want it to succeed by compromising what it was originally created for. 
I do understand why Blockstream doesn't come out and state their conflict of interest. People conflate conflict of interest with not being able to participate in a discussions, which simply isn't the case. Academic papers are published all the time with a list of potential conflicts. They aren't a judge, they a participant in the discussion and that discussion is full of specialized interests. You can name any dev and I can list at least a few associations with different companies that they have and use that to sling mud and claim conflict of interest. 
As far as theymos censoring XT discussion, I don't agree with it. I also don't agree with censoring ethereum discussion within reason. But when every other post is about ethereum or XT then I'd get a little perturbed as well. The threshold about what gets through on the Bitcoin sub used to be exteremly low (all sorts of off-topic discussion and scam links). That has improved, but I have a feeling the pendulum has swung the other way. 
I'm in a profession where a lot of intelligent people are not willing to admit that they have potential conflicts of interests. For the most part, I think they genuinely believe they can remain objective despite those conflicts. And for the most part, I think they can. They should still disclose those interests no matter how obvious they are.
**Edit**: Blockstream did address conflicts of interests accusations in their AMA. I myself find it sufficient -
@_date: 2015-08-16 22:20:24
I'll try to explain it, but you have to have a good understanding from the beginning - so this post is going to be long.
Bitcoin is a timestamping system. It it a practical/engineered solution to a problem that has been proved mathematically to be impossible to solve. The way it does this is not by "unproving the proof", but by taking the premise of that problem and modifying the criteria just a little bit (the "hash-weighted" majority of the parties must be acting with good faith).
Getting parties to behave in good faith when money is on the line is *really fucking hard*. Everyone all the time is looking for an edge, sometimes even if their selfish actions eventually cause the system to fail. In poker, there's a term for a type of cheating that keeps the other participants from realizing for a long time - it's called "angle shooting" - 
Well, miners have every incentive to "angle shoot" their competition just enough to where they won't be caught.  (hire third parties to DDOS the competition, selfish mining, eclipse attacks, etc.). For the most part, these things don't provide enough of an edge to really cause all that much damage, but with bigger blocks it might it just that much more likely to be damaging. It might be the straw that breaks the decentralized camel's back. I say might, because I don't know if that's true. I honestly believe that no one does, but I also know that the expert consensus (what we would call Grade D evidence in the medical field) from many smart people is that it has the potential to.
Additionally, relaying bigger blocks requires a higher bandwidth connection. If you look at Geo-IP locations of nodes around the world you'll notice that the majority of the nodes are in areas which have "fast" internet connections. The cool thing about Bitcoin is you only need one honest node that agrees to connect with you to be sure your actually using "Bitcoin"... the problem is that fewer nodes makes it a lot easier to fool you into believing you are participating in Bitcoin when you actually aren't. AFAIK, no one has ever had this attack performed on them, but it's possible and it gets easier to do when the nodes aren't controlled by good faith participants. So what makes people quit hosting a node? The threshold that we see is somewhere around "if it causes me any inconvenience whatsoever" for the hobbyist, "I can't possibly host this" for the enthusiast, and "I have to host this so I don't get screwed" for the miner and certain bitcoin businesses. We have already lost most of the first group and the second group will be phased out as soon as they can't manage to host it. That leaves the third group. The group that has to answer to court summons, VCs, stockholders, etc.

I think deferring settlement in the setting of a *cryptographic assurance* that the settlement will occur is the best option (off-chain, but not like changetip, more like Lightning), barring some amazing breakthrough that would allow for the security properties of Bitcoin to maintained in the setting of ever-increasing centralization risks.

This is pretty much what I mean (see my reply to sQtWLgK). But it's not trivial to "dumb down" some of these arguments and still represent what they truly are. There's a certain irreducible complexity to the problem. Historically, being on the side of the anti-intellectuals has been a poor choice, though (particularly in hard sciences). That said, they've been doing a very poor job of framing their arguments in ways that makes them easy to comprehend. That skill is actually really hard to be good at... takes someone like Carl Sagan to make it possible.

That's all well and good, but Blockstream received the $21 million of funding (11/17/14) before Rusty Russell joined Blockstream (~5/27/15) and before the LN paper was released (around Feb 2015). The ideas behind the lightning network existed before that (around the time when micropayment channels were en vogue), but the actual implementation wasn't laid out completely. And sidechains don't really do anything as far as increase transaction throughput (in the merged-mined setup anyway). 
It's also important to point out that the devs that are currently employed at blockstream are highly qualified individuals that could easily get 6 figure salaries at other institutions. If blockstream craters, it's not like they are going to be homeless. They have reported through various avenues that they plan to make money through consultancy (Big bank wants a sidechain for a settlement layer linked to SWIFT, how do we do this, etc.).
Also please note that Adam Back was part of ZKS (Zero-knowledge systems) another startup that received 12 million in funding from VCs back in 1999 (2000?). That start up was designed to help expand privacy technologies and in some ways frontrun the development of Tor (Ian Goldberg worked there as well).
Back and Maxwell bleed cypherpunk... if they were in it completely for the money they could have made it in a lot easier ways.

There are attacks that miners can use that become more economical the larger the blocks are, although it's debatable that a marginal increase in blocksize will make them really that much more powerful. That said I wouldn't call the blocksize debate orthogonal because it will make those "economies of scale, location, etc." even more powerful despite not being a true attack vector. Just because we're bleeding small timers with the end game becoming large mining centralization *even with a small blocksize* doesn't mean we should hurry it along a little faster.
Working for-profit isn't against cypherpunk ideals. It's a low blow, and it doesn't hold water when you consider the body of work they've contributed to. (Rusty with linux, Back with ZKS and the Perl shirts, Maxwell with wikipedia, etc.).
@_date: 2015-08-18 15:09:00
There's a lot wrong with this, it comes down to understanding the security of proof of work. XT seeing small blocks after there was a single large block means that the miners are now using completely different numbers to work on.
It also allows for any number of trivial consensus breaking attacks (e.g. send a valid transaction to one network and an equally valid, but mutually exclusive, transaction to the other network).
What you could do is have a merged mined large block side chain, but what you'll see is that there will be less miners willing to merge mine that chain and less people willing to run full nodes. That's why that particular type of sidechain isn't consider useful for transaction scaling.

My fear from this is that after XT fails (I believe it will, but I don't know for sure), we will be in a worse position. Not because XT was the better option (it isn't), but any future proposal of a hard fork change will be harder to compromise on. Any contention will be later argued as "trying to XT the debate."
Alternatively, if XT does succeed it opens up whole other can of worms... including legitimizing potentially dangerous hard forks in the future.
Essentially, we've been made to choose between a douche and a turd sandwich.
Something that I've been playing with in my head is actually using XT to show that Core devs can compromise on an unrelated (to the block size issue) hard fork that is much less contentious and implement it before the XT hard fork. Show that the process to get a hard fork done is possible without threats of going nuclear.
Alternatively, I think sipa's proposal is the best, and it's only contention would be the "too conservative" numbers he used. Perhaps a proposal with a hard fork with higher (but reasonably agreed upon) numbers with the intention of soft forking down to sipa's numbers - it essentially provides a "checked" amount of ability to break his number within reason if (yet nebulously defined) metrics of decentralization improve.

It's contained in a broadcasted Bitcoin transaction. Essentially at the first signing and broadcast the public addresses corresponding public key is revealed.

I did leave out a lot of advantages and disadvantages to the system, but there's countermeasures to some of the attacks that would be pretty difficult to block. For example, DDoSing would be difficult if you, the victim, can use an entirely different system (say your cellphone's connection) to let the network know you are closing the channel. The capital requirements of the hubs is concerning to me, too. The locked up funds problem is concerning as well, especially if the underlying asset (Bitcoin) is too volatile. So LN requires a stable-ish, well-distributed, well-powered Bitcoin that is running under the network. Even if it doesn't provide a scaling advantage over vanilla bitcoin, it will provide a few other advantages (the ones that it shares with micropayment channels) that I think will help bootstrap it. I don't think we'll know enough until it closer to implementation and I'm also not sure we have all the clever tricks (and gotchas) figured out yet. Still it's worth pursuing.
@_date: 2015-08-24 16:29:25
Why do you prefer BIP 101 over too-slow change? Risks seem apparent in both. If a 2nd course correction fork is needed in the future, it would seem the best solution would be to jump to 8MB without the exponential increase that follows since that is the primary objection most people have with BIP 101.
Additionally, it would be likely for any merchant processor (and wallet dev) to support anything that would make it easier to interact with the main chain since any additional layers on top would lead to a significant amount of time implementing to them (and thus increased up-front developer costs) despite the possibility that it would provide the best long term solution.
I really hope you guys can get something together at the workshops. Best of luck!

(Disclaimer: I'm not a lightning or sidechain developer... I've read through the papers, but it's been a while, so take what you read with a grain of salt. Go to the primary sources for more in-depth discussion. For brevity and technical reasons, I've simplified a lot of the discussion. I'm also particularly biased in that I think both ideas are likely to be *really* good ideas, so my criticism is probably a little light. A lot of that depends on my trust in  figures that have put forth the ideas).
LN and sidechains are really two different concepts.
We will start with LN. There's a thing called a micropayment channel which you could fill pages with regarding the details, but think of it like this: You have a certain amount of Bitcoin that you're willing to devote to a purchase... say a streaming video. You know you'll spend less than $20 on the video, but you don't know exactly when you'll stop the video. You construct a special transaction that you can adjust as you watch the video for as long as you watch it. If the content provider notices that you stop "streaming" your bitcoin to them, then they will stop "streaming" the video to you. Once the transaction is complete, you and the other party stop the transaction and you get your remaining Bitcoin back.
There's a few benefits to a micropayment channel:
* Once the initial transaction is setup, all the "streaming" which occurs is off the blockchain, you don't have to repeatedly "write" to the blockchain as if you were just making a whole bunch of 3 cent payments over and over.
* The exchange of Bitcoin occurs off the network, people won't know how much you'll spend until the transaction is complete and the channel is closed because after the initial transaction, you and the other party will be directly dealing with each other (but in a trustless manner).
* Once the channel is "open" they're is no delay for confirmation and it remains trustless.
A couple cons: 
* You have to open a transaction every time with every service that you're wanting to use... meaning you have to have a lot of upfront capital if you want multiple channels open.
* You still have to wait for the initial transaction to hit the blockchain before you and other party can trust each other.
So the LN is an extension of a micropayment channel, but instead of connecting to desired end party, you connect to a hub who may connect to another hub that may connect to the desired end party. It's important to note that hubs cannot steal your money in much the way that in a micropayment channel can't steal more than you already gave them. So you can think of the LN as a internet of micropayment channels. This has a few advantages for you and the hubs.
* You don't have to have as much upfront equity, you can use your funds for a variety of things (video, gas, electricity) and it still comes from the same "source."
* It remains trustless for the most part, hubs can refuse to accept your payment, or stop accepting your "stream," but they cannot take your money that you haven't already spent.
* There's a lot. The LN doesn't actually exist yet, although there is a pretty clear way forward and most agree there aren't any glaringly impossibly bad things to implement.
* The hubs will need to have capital available (and quite a lot depending on how long they keep their channels open) and that capital will have to be "hot" (can't be stored offline), which makes the hubs vulnerable to hacking events.
* It will have to use some special software for it and the end points will be something other than Bitcoin addresses (I think) - perhaps using a name service of some sort or a different type of identifier. It'll probably be a bit more complicated at least initially, but eventually the user interface should be very good (or at least comparable to Bitcoin, which I would still consider kinda OK).
* You'll be paying "fees" to use these hubs.
* A function LN requires a functioning Bitcoin network. If Bitcoin breaks, LN breaks.
So that's the LN. I'll add a separate side-chain post.

Everyone that owns Bitcoin has an "actual economic incentive" to take a stance on the block size. Large mining outfits will want to increase the blocksize to increase the barrier of entry for small miners, Bitcoin payment processors want to have more vanilla bitcoin transcations because it will cheaper for them than having to implement another payment layer, governments and hackers will be happy to deal with less nodes so they can successfully perform Sybils.
Then you have the cypherpunks... the people that told you that unencrypted internet traffic was bad, they told you that governments would be spying on your traffic, they told you to use PGP/GPG, and they are now telling you that there's no point in a distributed system that becomes less and less distributed. We should be working on network robustness (Bitsat, meshnets, LN, Sidechains). Trustlessness and censorship resistance is the overriding directive of Bitcoin... when I hear smart people (including ones not employed in blockstream) state that the blocksize increase will drop node count, I'm going to listen. What I'm hearing from sipa, Back, et. al are arguments that resonate with me in the setting of what was revealed by Snowden. 
That said I'm all for a blocksize increase to modest amount (I'm somewhere between Garzik's proposal and sipa's - with sipa's being a little to conservative).

Most of the Mojo codebase was not written in C/C++ (there is some though). I did a cursory comparison a while ago (back when that thread was published) and they didn't look all that similar. Of course, if I had found out he was Satoshi, I would have never shared it anyway. It's clear he wanted privacy, so why not honor that request.
Seems Jim has really kinda moved on with his life... perhaps we should honor that and leave him alone.

There are formal definitions that are being developed, but that requires formal descriptions of what Bitcoin *is* first. That level of scholarship is just now getting there. And when you get an answer, it's not going to be X nodes and Y miners, it's going to be something a bit more abstract, because we are dealing with BFT. Just because a property is hard to measure doesn't mean it doesn't exist (Lack of decentralization is a known failure mode of Bitcoin because it makes certain attacks trivial to perform).
What I'm hoping to see is for someone to define a dimensionless number eventually (like a Reynolds number) and uses that to describe network health (maybe that's already been done - would love to see a paper). At least that will give people a number to watch.
There's also some entirely unknowable things that impact how decentralized the network is. If we assume that all the Chinese miners are independent and not coerced (and will never be coerced in the future - hah!) then decentralization right now is not too bad. If they do work in concert (acting as a superpool), the network is already really broken.

Has any one done an analysis on reachable nodes by service provider Up/Down/Latency (Edit: GB Cap)... this would be helpful to predict node dropout with any change in blocksize limit. Does anyone know of a study? I suspect the majority will drop out with 8MB.
@_date: 2015-08-05 20:33:50
I think it's very likely to do with what the SEC and other regulatory bodies will and won't approve. They will not be ok with a completely decentralized system, at least not initially. It's not in their knowledge-base, it's *too* foreign. The fact that t0 has a Bitcoin block explorer built in tells me they are thinking long as well.
It's hard to think why this would make any sense to do it this way, but I think it's because banks are *SO* far behind what cryptography (not just "blockchains") can offer. All it takes is a look at the Fedwire system (or any other system) to realize how bad things actually are.

I don't think Mike is a intelligence agent, but I do think he will try and he wants to put checks into the privacy and pseudonymity of Bitcoin. He's consistent with that. It's not one idea it's a collection of ideas that he's put out. Search the tor dev list for his attempt to suggest a cert system for hidden services, or the proof of passport sybil resistance stuff (zksnark but with the ability for governments to spoof nodes).
This coupled with the fact that he used to work for QinetiQ makes some of the crazy fringe think he's intelligence. I don't believe he is, just that he has a worldview that's very antilibertarian.
In regards to BIP101, I have my objections to it. It will cause nodes to drop out if implemented (at least in the short term). There is no doubt about it. How many is another question. I look forward to the workshops as I think the level of scholarship about the block size issue will be much higher that what we see on the forums, dev list, and especially this subreddit.

Yes, and take the "asset address" and plug it in and it goes back to the same Bitcoin address.

@_date: 2015-08-25 20:55:37
They are. I wouldn't call it a voting protocol though, it's more like waving a support flag. The problem with the 8 mb scriptsig is that it could be misinterpreted (and is being misinterpreted) as a vote for bip101 since the first step is up to 8mb. Really what I think the Chinese miners were voting for was a static increase to 8 mb which was being conflated as support for bip101, a vote for bip100 makes it clear they don't support bip101. KNC has had the 8mb scriptsig vote as well but since they came out in support of bip101 I suspect they may head that way. Not being in China gives them a latency advantage over the Chinese miners which means bip101 may be marginally better for their selfish interests. I don't know for sure though.
In the end it's more what the entire checks and balances system agrees to (or divides to). I wish everyone could have waited until workshop. 
This is downright machiaveillian.

The second to last paragraph has something about introducing "fire drills" by embedding a block with two separate merkle trees in it. A miner would have to know which merkle tree was actually valid before it could build onto that block (otherwise it would be wrong 50% of the time). This would help keep not-really-validating miners (so-called "SPV" miner) from being hijacked to serve as a pawn to attack "not full node" "hearn-style" SPV wallets. I think.

Road to hell is paved with good intentions... but I really think there are a lot of little seen or unseen bad faith actors who want to tweak things just enough to *slowly* pressure Bitcoin to a centralized future. I know this is conspiratorial, but it's an interesting thought exercise. If I was asked how to "break" bitcoin, the plan would start out a lot like this 
* Introduce a marginally improved node which is consensus compatible, wait until there is some community support for it
* Use a legitimate concern that people have and use it to manufacture a controversy which is divisive (bonus points if that controversy actually serves to centralize mining, discourage independent full nodes, and discourage the use of meshnet/extra-internet/darknets).
* Identify key individuals in mining field and schmooze them or replace them.
* Using mining control, move Bitcoin as close to a permissioned ledger as possible without having the "people" riot.
* Introduce "solutions" that incrementally marginalize "bad actors" (blacklisting, coin tainting, etc.)
Although I support a bigger block system (although I don't feel it's immediate deployment is necessary), I can not support XT. It's not the bigger block, it's the realpolitick that has been used around it.
I will leave it at this, I don't believe that Mike Hearn or Gavin Andressen are acting in bad faith... but (Hearns) ideas have repeatedly been on the side with making "extra-network" enforcement actions easier to perform - including in projects outside of Bitcoin. My view of bitcoin is that the consensus mechanism must be as distributed as possible. We don't have the science on this yet, but people need to realize that Bitcoin is fault tolerant, not fault proof. That tolerance depends on the majority of the mining participants behaving "honestly" and there is enough nodes present that good faith nodes cannot be surrounded by bad faith nodes.

They aren't coders, that's my point... it's like not understanding the difference from a mechanic and a mechanical engineer.
Regarding what you have said. You're right, it doesn't, but you can't put finance experts in place of the Bitcoin devs and make it work out. Look into the research articles written by these (financial and some cryptography) experts and it becomes apparent they know nothing of distributed computing systems. What they suggests many times would not work, it's impossible and proven so. It's the very basics, yet these are the same people that are trying to wrest control from the experts.
Satoshi didn't necessarily design bitcoin with a hard limit because it was his ideal money, he may have done it out of necessity to get the incentives right. He didn't add that piece of code years ago that's causing all these problems now for no reason, he did it for a several reasons which he declined (as far as I can tell) from sharing it with anyone. When jgarzik tried to patch it out, he declined it's removal. Why?
It's a bit odd that it was added at about the same time that bitcoin was /.ed and mining pool invention (slush started his service in couple months after, but it was being discussed before then). If he stated his intention (he didn't) then this argument would be centered on the actual substance of that (it isn't). Sure he said it could be changed in the future (note he never said removed), but my impression of his motivations at that time would be this: with the advent of mining pools, the game theory involved would mean that a large mining cooperative would eventually gain control. One (primitive) way to slow that down would be to set a blocksize limit. It would also prevent some trivial DOS and double-spend attacks at the time.
The invention of IBLT (and relay network) have made it where the blocksize limit could be increased, it doesn't mean it should go away. The urgency of XT seems manufactured as a power grab. Look back a year ago in my post history in conversations with nullc, mike_hearn, and petertodd... you'll see some interesting opinions about what's going on now.

XT like a lot of things is a tradeoff. In my opinion, the negatives out weigh the positives. For one, although Hearn and Gavin are Bitcoin experts, I do not believe they have the vision to keep Bitcoin "punk rock." This may sound silly, but I don't think growing Bitcoin up is the right call and in fact it's really concerning to me that so much VC has been poured into the space so quickly and eagerly. To me Bitcoin is being forced to grow up too quickly and the Blocksize increase is the equivalent of a game developer cloning the last three levels of their game to satisfy a publishers demand to "ship." You can hear it in Hearn's posts... the urgency of it needing to get done and be ready for the big time. How does he know this? Is it cargo-cult mentality (built it and they will come?) or is it some other prescience? I don't believe this is the right approach, especially since much of the space is focusing on concepts such as permissioned blockchains which could conceivably run a much higher block size with no difficulty whatsoever (since they aren't decentralized in the least).
Additionally, Hearn is a pragmatic leader. He will trade perfection for "good enough" almost every time. Gavin is not the perfect contrast to that, because he's a bit of a pragmatic as well. Neither have the "Steve Jobs" factor to them, something that I think a few of the other core devs have in spades. Essentially, I don't think the "Core" is as broken as they say it is. If XT becomes dominant, I think we'll see a lot more "oops we screwed up" moments in the future. They'll probably all be survivable, though.
In reality, it's a judgment call. I think the tradeoffs aren't worth it, but I accept that others might see it differently.

This is incorrect. The implementations in bitcoinj were for payment channels only. They also didn't take into account a number of ways to cheat the counterparty since things like CLTV and CSV weren't even enforced on the network at that time, much less malleability not being fixed. So it was broken to even implement payment channels until 2015 I think (can't remember the exact time when CSV and CLTV were enforced).
Also Satoshi described payment channels and it's strongly suggested by how he implemented bitcoin in the initial release that he was already thinking about them being used.

Direct pdf link: 
Abstract: 


extract and analyze the core of the Bitcoin protocol, which we term the Bitcoin backbone, and
prove two of its fundamental properties which we call common prefix and chain quality in the
static setting where the number of players remains fixed. Our proofs hinge on appropriate and
novel assumptions on the “hashing power” of the adversary relative to network synchronicity;
we show our results to be tight under high synchronization.
Next, we propose and analyze applications that can be built “on top” of the backbone protocol,
specifically focusing on Byzantine agreement (BA) and on the notion of a public transaction
ledger. Regarding BA, we observe that Nakamoto’s suggestion falls short of solving it,
and present a simple alternative which works assuming that the adversary’s hashing power is
bounded by 1/3. The public transaction ledger captures the essence of Bitcoin’s operation as
a cryptocurrency, in the sense that it guarantees the liveness and persistence of committed
transactions. Based on this notion we describe and analyze the Bitcoin system as well as a
more elaborate BA protocol, proving them secure assuming high network synchronicity and
that the adversary’s hashing power is strictly less than 1/2, while the adversarial bound needed
for security decreases as the network desynchronizes.
Some interesting discussion in the bottom of the article:


the proper operation of Bitcoin. Importantly, we show that as the network ceases to synchronize
fast enough compared to the proof-of-work rate (i.e., the worst-case time that takes honest players
to “hear” each other becomes substantial compared to the time it takes to solve a proof of work),
the honest majority property ceases to hold and the bound offered by our analysis that is required
to obtain a robust transaction ledger approaches 0 as f approaches 1. Note that the effects of bad
synchronization is in the maintenance of the common prefix property, which is the critical property
for showing agreement.

I think you're missing the part where you take your fake block and give it an "not-really-validating" miner to ~~amplify the possibility that your attack will be successful.~~ make your attack even cheaper to perform.
* Build a fake block with coins going to victim(s).
* Find a mining pool (or group of pools) that aren't validating
* Let them build the chain for you.
Problem is that's a little bit more detectable to the network as a whole.

It seems like their explorer only takes Bitcoin addresses and something called asset address.

I'd wager that the 8MB votes will soon move over to BIP100 support as well (except KNCMiner). The game is afoot.
Edit: Here's link to the proposal and the "meat" of it:
Protocol changes proposed:


2. Remove static 1MB block size limit.
3. Simultaneously, add a new floating block size limit, set to 1MB.
4. The historical 32MB limit remains.
5. Schedule the hard fork on testnet for September 1, 2015.
6. Schedule the hard fork on bitcoin main chain for January 11, 2016.
7. Changing the 1MB limit is accomplished in a manner similar to BIP 34, a one­way lock­in
upgrade with a 12,000 block (3 month) threshold by 90% of the blocks.
8. Limit increase or decrease may not exceed 2x in any one step.
9. Miners vote by encoding ‘BV’+BlockSizeRequestValue into coinbase scriptSig, e.g.
“/BV8000000/” to vote for 8M. Votes are evaluated by dropping bottom 20% and top
20%, and then the most common floor (minimum) is chosen.

BIP100 seems to be least worse, but I'm afraid that handing block size adjustments to miners isn't exactly setting up a free market.

I agree with you Blockstream is potentially way more lucrative (I meant to state that in my original post, but didn't want to get bogged down), but it's also a lot riskier. I bet their salaries are actually quite low with the expectation that the company will be very successful in the future.

Garzik throws that in as a point of where a "second voice" for nodes can be heard. I think it should be in there.

For some reason, people really hate him for that, but it also makes him really valuable to have around (I know of no other dev that fills that role quite as well). Be glad he's not really Bitcoin's enemy.

That's the point from the miners perspective, but now look at it from a node's perspective that doesn't get the benefit of the fees+coinbase, but still have the burden to verify. Is their hardware up to task, should they be excluded from the network for not being able to keep up? This is about as simplified as model of one aspect of the system as you can get. The "messy details" as Peter puts it is exactly what needs to be understood. I would like to see a more complete analysis. The initial algebra is nice and makes some concepts easy to understand, but I wouldn't be surprised in the least if the understanding requires a little bit deeper math.
(Edit: I just want to point out, that after trying to get more informed into the blocksize issues I feel that there should be an increase, I just don't know how much. Perhaps no limit is correct, but I have a gut feeling that isn't the case.)

I believe there is good chance that "core" won't be abandoned completely. 
There are a lot of variables though.
* At first the UTXOs will mostly be very similar with each other, meaning spent coins on one chain could be spent trivially on the other chain... eventually they would diverge.
* If the value of the Core coin drops to a fraction of it's value (so 25%), it still would make economic sense to mine on it with some hardware, especially if a retarget occurs. If it makes it to a retarget, then all bets are off.
* If the majority of the devs actively support the Core coin, there's a chance that certain previously controversial softforks could be implemented rather quickly.
* The Core chain could be used to grief XT.
I could write a couple pages and provide a more in depth analysis of this.

There is a way, but I wouldn't recommend it unless you are a  *very* advanced user. I don't mean to be offensive, but you asking this question means you don't fit in that category.
Here's just one thing wrong with your logic: let's say you use that javascript utility after you have used your dice to enter your base6 entropy. Who's to say that utility is actually doing what it is saying it's doing and not just trashing your entropy. If you say it's because it's open source, you've arrived at the same place as just using the trezor.
It is possible (and recommended) to verify the entropy given to the trezor by the computer is actually used... I think they explain how to do that on their site, but's it's been a while since I looked into it.

If you want 100 nodes (one node per 60 million people) in the wild all on the backbone of the internet with well mapped traffic maps, you're in for a world of hurt. As far as mining goes I'll consider it well enough distributed when I have to kidnap or blackmail &gt; 10 people to coerce the current mining group into behaving nefariously. I bet I could do it with only 5 kidnappings at this point. (Disclaimer: I'm not planning on blackmailing or kidnapping anybody).

I think Hearn's issue is that he gets stuck when he goes down a long line of reasoning:
* Lighthouse, his baby, requires a copy of the utxo. Something that wasn't realized earlier in development (lot of intellectual and monetary capital already invested in the idea).
* The only way to presently get that done would be to run as a full node.
* Well let's just make getutxos so we can make that happen!
* Rejected by Core... well I'll just make an alternate node implementation with getutxos in it then.
At the second point, I think most devs would have said... "Well it's a strong incentive to run a full node, I'll just make that a requirement." In Hearns mind, running a node is already too hard for the average Lighthouse user.
If you look in the "enemy planted it there" you could come up with some support for that idea as well, though. But that makes it a conspiracy.
To me Hearn suffers from the "I'm always right" syndrome way more than almost any other dev (with the possible exception of Todd - who tends to be more right most of the time anyway). I have no idea why anyone would think it was good idea to give him commit access and "final say."

I actually don't think it's being elaborately ignored by the academics (and most of the devs). They certainly aren't wanting to dumb that part down, as it will scare the "muggles" as you put it. Give me a little bit and I'll pull some quotes. 
See here:

Hearn's comment in that thread is especially perplexing given his recent actions.

He doesn't write out exactly what he's fearful of, but it's important to think of what the motivations for a "smart property" miner to be.

It may not be pain medicine. He mentions he had an aneurysm and a headache. He probably had an intracranial/subarachnoid hemorrhage due to that and has some residual neurologic deficits. Very unfortunate situation. To OP: get a lawyer now if you can. If you have a trusted friend or associate explain the situation to them so they can help convey what the circumstances are to the lawyer.

* it is the most crucial aspect of Satoshis discovery
I'd argue that it is not. Remember the goal was to produce a trustless system, meaning that you don't have to worry at all about the other stakeholders to influence the ledger other than with what assets they control. The fact that some stakeholders (miners/nodes) have some control (with as much of that control removed as possible) is undesirable, but necessary. It's necessary because of the security properties that define Bitcoin (break the underlying assumptions, and the security of Bitcoin goes out the window).
* 3) Nearly every clearing model is based upon a net deferred settlement cycle, i.e. settlement does not happen until certain time-periods every day when all obligations to deliver are conducted through Delivery vs Payment (DvP) or Payment vs Payment (PvP). This is normal, and will work the same way even with the internet's "base money". When settlement is conducted, it is crucial that the multiple accounts can have a simultaneous discharge of obligations, i.e. the blocksize needs to be large enough to allow for the net settlement between the multitude of accounts/addresses to be included in one block/transaction which may be significantly larger than 1mb, even if the blockchain purely functions as a large value payments system.
The blocksize needs to be large enough to maintain reasonable usefulness while also maintaining the underlying security properties of Bitcoin. If that blocksize is large enough to be used for certain financial services, then great. If not, then other solutions will have to be entertained. It should be noted that very few devs agree with keeping the 1 mb blocksize limit, they only disagree with how it should grow and how urgent it is.
I think it's also important to differentiate different types of side-chains and caching layers (e.g. Lightning) and how they operate. Lightning would be considered for the most part Bitcoin proper... it trustlessness properties would be similar to Bitcoin *as long as the security properties of Bitcoin are intact*. Sidechains could be defined as any number of methods to peg another system to Bitcoin. In the case of a privately controlled chain (not censorship resistant in the least, coins can be forfeited due to regulation/whims) you could still have very fast settlement times on the order of many thousands of transactions per second. Other types of sidechains dependent on mining would have different security properties depending on how they were mined, etc. Those type of sidechains probably have little to no ability to "scale" bitcoin transactions without a trade off in security.

A miner could because the BIP101 is based on the version number in the block and the BIP100 support is based on the scriptsig in the coinbase transaction (unless I'm missing something obvious).
Edit: It should be noted that the way miners are supporting BIP100 is just putting it in the scriptsig... they aren't using the possible "/BV000000/" format which is listed as an example in BIP100. BIP100 doesn't exist as code, yet.

I would say that it exists even in other OSS projects, but to a lesser extent. There's definitely more "funny business" in Bitcoin, but it exists in projects such as Tor or OpenSSL. That said, I think most of the  frequently accused are some of the least likely to be acting in bad faith.

@_date: 2015-08-24 15:09:23
Good points, but the problem is communicating what you said in way that a decent minority (not even a majority!) could understand. Regarding the instant transmission of messages, we know that to be an impossibility (speed of light and all that), so how much latency in the network between messengers can we tolerate before byzantine failures occur? See my latest reddit submission (hopefully you're aren't the author) that I shamelessly stole from Szabo's (and thus Miller's) twitter.
Additionally, we have to consider active attackers that are not motivated by the economics in-system, but "out of band." Just because it makes rational sense to behave a certain way in the vacuum of the Bitcoin network doesn't mean we are safe.
I guess my point is that though "decentralization" is a nebulous thing it doesn't mean its impact on the security of the network can be discounted. I'm pretty sure we can agree on that. ;)

I know you aren't, I'm referring to Todd's post... 


anyone with a non-trivial amount of hashing power. (and getting that is
surprisingly easy, e.g. w/ SPV mining)
I'm just saying you can use a trivially small amount of hashrate to generate just one block then feed it to another (more powerful) miner that isn't truly validating the way they should, so you could get away with having even less hashrate. (Edit: perhaps I've misinterpreted with what he means with that sentence)

Imagine your job is to find things wrong with the automobile at it's inception. You can find plenty wrong... you could write about the nonstandard pedal systems, the slow speeds, the need to crankstart, the limited amount of oil in the world, and every other single problem. Swanson is very good at finding problems and writing about them. In my opinion, his writing is often of the "wet street causes rain" variety, but not always. I tend to think his somewhat adversarial writing is actually helpful, but you'll find many that disagree.
Let me give you an example of a discussion I had with a him about a year ago. I've since changed my opinion on few of the things that I said. Almost all of my changes in opinion have to do with what I think is technically feasible now. It might give you some insight into what he is thinking about, though:

Those quantum entanglement tricks can't transfer information any faster than the speed of light even if the action is instant across large distances.

It wouldn't be hard at all to make a fork that does that... I could fork (in the traditional FOSS sense) XT and be done in an afternoon. That's really not the point being made though. 
The issue of introduction of hard forks and the issue of the block size are viewed as the same issue (by quite a few), when they really aren't. Essentially we are setting precedent for how future hard forks may be handled (blood all over the ground). This "war" is not going to elevate the winners no matter which side wins. Yet, we are all made to pick sides now.
@_date: 2015-08-24 15:55:15
Sorry your first sentence is untrue. It wasn't possible to define why the sun produced light until very recently... but we knew it was desirable and we knew it was important. More closely related, we know that Navier-Stokes existence and smoothness is an important problem (or P&lt;&gt;NP/N=NP), but we haven't got good definitions of those.
It's extremely desirable to be decentralized (Bitcoin relies on it!) what we don't know is how decentralized is good enough in the setting of parties interested in attacking. It's an area that's actively being studied (in real formal ways - see Andrew Miller's work). In fact, there's probably ways that would only cost a few thousand dollars that could grief Bitcoin at this point way worse than those transaction stress tests ever could.


The reason we care about it is because Bitcoin relies on it to work - that's it. Otherwise you rely on a central authority, the very problem that Bitcoin was trying to overcome. If you want a permissioned ledger, get some Citicoin.

Even if there was a conflict of interest, I don't believe you should recuse yourself in this situation. You aren't the judge and jury. People in most fields of science that work in the private industry have some interests that may cause conflict... and what do they do? They disclose them, and then move on. It's not a perfect system, and disclosed potential conflicts should be considered by a reasonable person, but in and of themselves are not a good argument for discounting a speakers opinion on a subject.
Edit: I also think you should post this comment when this discussion (which will certainly appear again on the front page) occurs again.

I think both sides believe the other is financially and technically reckless. The fact that it's been reduced to two sides is a problem itself, as this video points out.

There's standard, non-standard, and invalid transactions. Standard and non-standard can be mined, but most nodes do not relay non-standard transaction types (though some do). For somebody to get their non-standard transaction in a block they either have to find a miner that's willing to include it in their block (historically Eligius) or mine it themselves. isStandard is just a check to cut down on weird transactions propagating the network. This was a non-standard transaction, but since F2Pool mined it themselves it bypassed the isStandard check.

I don't want to give you false information. There's a lot of not so obvious problems in the fields, but being well connected in the case of an orphan race both decreased latency and increased bandwidth could be be a few more BTC profitable daily (increased expected value), which can add up. Things get even more complicated in the case of IBLT/relay networks and the exploits that can be used against them.
See here:
But really that doesn't matter all that much: it only matters how the individual *perceives* what is to their advantage. Some people (miners included) are able to see the big picture, other's see an edge to take advantage of, others only think locally. It's like playing poker... you have to be aware of people's irrationality and level of thought they are putting into things.

Have you seen any analysis that's been undertaken on the capital requirements to keep a channel open a certain length? I discussed a similar concept here 10 months ago:  and the conclusion I ran into was that the capital required might be prohibitive. By reading some of your comments, I think you have the same concerns. I hope somebody is drilling down what will actually be required and if it's reasonably scalable.
@_date: 2015-08-18 03:22:31
Oh, I have no idea really. In fact, I'm pretty sure Todd is not saying that, just pointing out an already existing attack and a couple different ways to mitigate it (one by breaking "hearn style" also sometimes called "lite" SPV wallets in their existing form - more than they already are). 0-day accounts who post from bitcoin-dev to reddit often title their posts "creatively."

Don't mistake what I'm saying, at some point you have to act and Bitcoin will need future changes.

The 'it' is the Bitcoin network. Because if the counterparty tries to misbehave, you can use the time-lock transaction to redeem the remaining funds (less the lost time value of the transaction) with an on chain transaction.

I love how a lot of the old-timers are giving warnings to people and then we are getting the same old "this time it's different" reply. I don't like making price predictions because there's no way I can call the top, but I don't see how there's not going to be a sizable correction (or crash). With every influx we get a bunch of newbies that don't know the difference between cold storage and storing on an exchange.
It used to be possible to give some education on here, but now with so much influx and so many astroturfers it's hard to tell genuine ignorance from malicious FUDers.
I'm actually looking forward to the get rich quick people leaving. Not because I want Bitcoin to crash... It's just easier to tell what's really going on in the space when the price isn't parabolic.

It's there SOP for this stuff. It's called account aggregation and uses screen scraping (and other ways of harvesting data) when you login to your bank account. The idea is that they don't "steal" your password as you type it in and it gives them access to financials to help with analytics and stuff. It makes it easier for people to manage multiple accounts (credit cards, bank accounts, and other things) in a single spot. A lot of money management sites online use the system to make it where people don't have to import and export their data manually.
Companies like Yodlee (never heard of them? Well they were bought for 660 million dollars by Envestnet -  specialize in this ability.

This was a transaction to decrease UTXO bloat if I understand correctly. (being discussed on IRC).
Edit: From my understanding, if you could make a 20MB block with a 20 MB single transaction, the time to verify that transaction/block would increase quadratic, not linear.

I won't argue that the supply of doctors is artificially restricted, but I will argue who caused it. The AMA is no peach, but I really feel that it has more to do with Medicare/ACGME and the hospital lobby than anything. To become a licensed physician in the United States you need a MD, DO, or MBBS from an approved school in addition to at least 1 year of post graduate residency education (intern) year. In reality it's at least 3 years of post-grad education if you want to get a reasonable job. The supply of international MDs and the increasing rate of US graduating medical students far outpaces the supplies of the number of residency spots. So the rate limiting step is actually the number of residency positions available. Here's where it gets complicated, Medicare pays a supplement per resident per year to a hospital that supports a resident (It's around $100k/yr). The hospital pays the resident around 45-55k/year and uses the excess money for "education" and administration. In reality, resident's save hospitals thousands of dollars per year (you'll never get a hospital to admit that - they want to make it look like supporting a residency program costs them money). Hospitals will not support more residents than the ACGME approves for and Medicare won't give more money to increase spots without a fight. If anything, it's the ACGME and CMS that are responsible for the doctor crunch.
AMA is mostly powerless anyway at this point (only about 15% of practicing physicians are part of the AMA, but every single one of them attended an ACGME approved residency spot).

Proof of work hasn't failed us... people not realizing what its function is the main problem. This misunderstanding makes them design systems which have even worse failings. They want to give that power to some one, when the ideal Bitcoin gives power to no one. We don't have the ideal yet, but it is achievable with careful incremental progress. What we are watching is people (miners in particular) fighting to keep power that they should not have. 
I'm fairly confident that a redecentralization of mining will begin at some point. It may not happen with current proof of work algorithm, but it would be the most beneficial if we stayed with it. I don't have time to explain my reasoning, but firing the current miners would be undesirable in many ways. 
@_date: 2015-08-24 20:31:11
Selective orphaning in the case of 51% attack may be the miner's best option (rather than mining all 100% of blocks). Got to keep the cash-cow going after all. To me that's completely broken, though. If we can't rely on censorship resistance and immutability then might as well used a trusted third party and save all the proof-of-work.

Back when brainwallets were in vogue, some enterprising person figured that out pretty quickly, and made quite a bit off of that.

Nothing wrong with smart contracts. Problem is how ethereum "solved" the problem. Ethereum is the ~~Edsel~~ Tucker 48 of cryptocurrency: some good ideas with a lot of poor execution.

I'm way out of my comfort level with this, but there's a hash function that has quadratic performance, usually the ECDSA check (which is linear) dominates the function, but for transactions with a large number of inputs the hash function dominates.

Overall is true, but not in worse case which is what this illustrates. The solution suggested by people that want a sizable block increase is with the hardfork also make the 100 kb per transaction rule a hard consensus rule. Apparently there will be another BIP for this.

If you make the assumption that people act with a global rationality (not sure what the real term is?), but it's classic game theory that we can't make that assumption.

That's certainly true... nodes will eventually fall out of the hands of an individuals ability to host, but when should that happen? I don't run a node on my computer any more. I used to and still have the capability to. I have a significant amount of Bitcoin in cold storage, and yet I'm acting in a selfish manner. Why did I stop running it? Because I felt it was a little too much of resource hog and I wanted to play a video game every once in a while. I could easily set up a separate system to run as a node, but why? Other people are doing it for me. I think a large part of this debate centers on how much understanding about the subject is needed before action is taken. Some people feel that action should be taken yesterday, others feel it's right at the breaking point (sustained filling of blocks with "usual" fee transactions).

Suppose you live in a made up country Deeproastia which has a national bank which has a national currency (deeprostia dollars). For some reason - government corruption, war, economic disaster - the value of the country's money is going down with no end in sight. The smart people in that country realize this, and start using their Deeproastia dollars to buy US dollars (or whatever else). This drives the value of the exchange rate of Deeproastia Dollars down relative to US dollars even further which sets up a catastrophic drop in value of the money. The central bank has two options to handle this, print more money or keep people from using the money in a way that would drive the perceived value down (things like banning exchange for a "stronger" currency, buying certain assets, etc.). The second options is called capital controls. Really, it's more than one thing but the general idea is to keep people from doing things with their money that the government finds undesirable.

Personally, it doesn't make sense on another level which you've touched on. Antpool currently has 16.8% of the hashrate.

If you can run a bitcoin node on a home PC, you'll probably be able to run a LN daemon. In order to do that though, you'll have to have a reasonable amount of capital. "Reasonable" is my weasel word here because I don't know exactly how much. The nice part is that if you have a small amount of capital, you'll probably only be able to support a small number of channels.
Don't expect to make a lot of money. I've done some back of the envelope calculations and I actually think for quite a while lightning node fees will be low due to a significant amount of altruism. 
I think there's a threshold where people are willing to donate their bandwidth and I suspect that the same folks that run nodes altruistically will probably be able to run lightning daemons without thinking too much about the costs. We shall see though.

I think you're worried about how sidechains and LN affect money supply. You need not worry about LN in the way you'd worry about colored coins or counterparty assets.
I think one of the big issues here is that layered systems on bitcoin (I'm speaking of LN and related systems) are still "full reserve" systems. LN cannot run as a fractional reserve in the way it's currently envisioned. If it was a way to allow fractional reserve transactions *on a protocol level* I don't think anyone would be excited about it.
Ironically, no changes to Bitcoin have to made to run a fractional reserve of bitcoin (as you can see from Cryptsy/MtGox, and hopefully not Coinbase). Securitization will always be possible no matter what M0 is made from (paper, gold, or Bitcoin).

At that point, we know with some assurance that Satoshi was not the only miner on the network, since the initial client had a CPU miner built in. If I was one of the earlier miners, I would would never announce it and I would try not to spend those coins for as long as possible. Being ID'd as an early miner is a bad thing. The people that we know were early miners almost universally state they spent their coins or lost them and don't have all that many. 
My position is that a significant portion of early coins are waiting for blockchain analytics to be kneecapped by advances in transaction fungibility.
Further, estimates of Satoshi's coins exists (although some have poked some hole in it): 
Near the end of the article, the estimate of satoshi's percent hashrate is ~10-20% after Jan 2010.

Although I like seeing the data, I don't think you can draw the conclusion that these coins are lost (I didn't see you draw that conclusion, just wanted to point it out for other readers). 2013 is not that old when it comes to bitcoin. Armory was pretty popular before then and I think quite a few people have coins that are in "ice cold" cold storage from then.

Agreed, I've been following the development closely. What I'm trying to say is that LN as advertised is still some time out and I expect (but don't know for sure) that by the time it does come out we will have both 2MB+SW (We also need BIP112 as well). As far as it delaying development, it doesn't really matter all that much since the devs can write the code for what they expect and then make the minor tweaks later. It seems like the routing problems is what they are focusing on right now anyway.

Based on the write up on Schnorr Signatures in the elements repo, about 7-8 bytes per signature is saved. It depends on the segwit discount, but it seem to work out to be around a *maximum* of 2.9 extra transactions per second per MB blocksize (probably quite a bit less, more like 12% more by another calculation I did). ~~That's if there is no "discount" in signature data.~~ I'm not sure how to do the math to figure out how Segwit would affect this.

The will of the economic majority is rather fickle. Network effect will only keep Bitcoin going so long in the setting of a (visible) Byzantine failure. If another system which provides better fault tolerance (e.g. one that has better parameters), then there is a good chance people will move to that system. We have seen failure of altcoins due to that (better implementation of a esoteric detail makes similar coin flounder).


It doesn't annoy cryptographers, since the elimination of that risk is exactly what the value prospect of cryptography is in the setting of finance. The presence of that risk literally pays their check.


The risk of an attack in the case of 51% failure is not measurable (past performance does not predict future outcomes).  It's also no different than the status quo.


Except they don't have to expend the POW in a honest fashion if their mind is already made up. Re-orgs attacks would be a bit more expensive, but they would only do that if they had an economic incentive to do so.

First, you don't get to say you have a PhD then get one later to make it "all good." That would be like me saying I was a physician while I was in medical school... it's fraudulent. Second, publishing a thesis does not automatically mean you get a PhD. There's typically a defense that has to be done. Third, that paper does not look like a thesis for a PhD in Computer Science, but something more akin to Cyber Security. Fourth, it appears that Charles Sturt University offers a PhD by "publication targets" and it seem that CSW submitted his thesis with that in mind, hence this little doozy of a statement in the thesis:


conference proceeding. The trade-off for this approach is that the flow of
the thesis becomes more disjointed as the chapters consist of a series of
separate publications which have been joined to form a body of research.
Each paper has been presented in the original format (excepting that
appendixes have been removed to the end of the thesis and that the
abstract has been incorporated into the main chapter body). Each peer-reviewed
paper has been updated to allow publication per the reviewer’s
requirements and to make a more coherent flow. 
CSU's [own site]( states this about the "publication target" approach to obtaining a PhD (emphasis mine):

From "The Moral Character of Cryptographic Work"
The framing of mass surveillance determines what
one thinks it is about.102 And mass surveillance has been brilliantly framed by
power so as to slant discourse in a particular and predictable direction. Let me
describe what I’ll call the law-enforcement framing, as regularly communicated
by people like (U.S.) FBI Director James Comey:103
1. Privacy is personal good. It’s about your desire to control personal information
about you.
2. Security, on the other hand, is a collective good. It’s about living in a safe
and secure world.
3. Privacy and security are inherently in conflict. As you strengthen one, you
weaken the other. We need to find the right balance.
4. Modern communications technology has destroyed the former balance. It’s
been a boon to privacy, and a blow to security. Encryption is especially
threatening. Our laws just haven’t kept up.104
5. Because of this, bad guys may win. They are terrorists, murderers, child
pornographers, drug traffickers, and money launderers.105 The technology
that we good guys use—the bad guys use it too, to escape detection.
6. At this point, we run the risk of Going Dark.106 Warrants will be issued,
but, due to encryption, they’ll be meaningless. We’re becoming a country of
unopenable closets. Default encryption may make a good marketing pitch,
but it’s reckless design. It will lead us to a very dark place.
The narrative is inconsistent with the history of intelligence gathering, and with
the NSA’s own mission statement.107 Yet the narrative’s uneasy coexistence
with reality hasn’t mattered. It is, in fact, beautifully crafted to frame matters
in a way guaranteed to lead discourse to where power wants it to go. It is a
brilliant discourse of fear: fear of crime; fear of losing our parents’ protection;
even fear of the dark. The narrative’s well-honed deceptiveness is itself a form
of tradecraft.108

@_date: 2017-04-11 16:13:59
I'm speculating, but they may have "perfected" a method which grinds the collisions they needed for a filled block at that point.
It would go like this:
* SPV mine using the empty block covert ASICBoost.
* While doing this, validate transactions and then grind changes in coinbase transaction and other transactions so that covert ASICBoost could be enabled on that as well. Once this is found, switch that miner over to empty block covert ASICBoost to transaction filled block ASICBoost.
Their process in finding the appropriate collisions probably improved, and their empty blocks became less frequent because of this.
I used to have a source for time between block announcements, and antpool was one of the few that would produce empty blocks minutes after prior blocks. I'm still trying to find that source though. Not only that, they've built empty blocks on their own blocks - ones which they should already know are valid and what transactions were in it.
Edit: Changed wording to make it clear I was being more speculative.

The only nodes that matter as far as latency is concerned is mining nodes. Matt's relay network is what you have to beat... and you can't do it.

Yes this is a win for the first pool to support ASICBoost overtly. Unfortunately, it would be a patent infringement in most jurisdictions. Not sure how the licensing would be carried out.

He's wrong here. One time pads are unbreakable with respect to computer power (provided that the keys are never compromised). If your adversary has a computer of infinite power, but doesn't have access to the pad, it cannot break the ciphertext.
I suspect that we are getting to the point where the NSA is having trouble with modern public key encryption techniques so they have to rely on implementation flaws as well as crypto that is broken/backdoored (Dual_EC_DRBG). We'll see what happens as QCs come along.

I think having a BIP with PR ready code is the most likely to be accepted, but I don't blame Gavin for not getting a PR ready since he knows there's not a chance of it being merged. There's a lot of meta and meta-meta actions that are going on at the same time. These people aren't the most emotionally intelligent in the world. 
Take this example that I just stumbled upon looking for the PR you were referencing:
Gavin submits a uncontroversial PR which then gets a question from sipa (why not use microsecond precision instead of millisecond?). Gavin replies


Then morcos writes:


Btcdrak agrees. Then Gavin closes the PR with the comment "Not important enough to me to bikeshed."
Same day somebody makes the microsecond changes as sipa asked... 
the PR has a good amount of discussion and then merged 3 days later.
This seems like a lot of passive-aggressive behavior on both sides (even after the merge, jgarzik starts to discuss why the code is needed at all as a default-off). I'm hoping they ALL start being more introspective.

If solo miners were excluded from the relay network I'd agree with you, but they aren't. As far as I can tell small fries can use it too. Similarly large miners can choose to be adversarial and share there blocks privately with other large miners (theres evidence that Chinese miners do this already). This xtreme block method does nothing to correct that behaviour.
Further a node running blocks only will have even less bandwidth usage and these methods are mutually exclusive. We can argue about that this is healthier for the network and I would agree with you, but you can't sell it as the cheapest bandwidth way to run a full node. 
You posted it and then posted that you had posted it with a link. Even with the np subdomain that's a little fishy, further some of the posters from that thread are posting here. If btc is going to be a meta-sub like buttcoin, they should at least own up to it.

Its hard to parse. The type of RBF implemented in core is called "opt in RBF" eg in order to take advantage your initial transactions have to be designated as RBF (default in all current wallets that I know of, including core is opted out). But the switch tells your node whether or not you are going to treat RBF transactions as doublespent and not relay them. So you would opt out of participating in opt in RBF. Clear as mud, huh? Funnily enough the available XT nodes would relay the transactions (the first double spend unless that's changed recently) anyway so it really comes down to if the miners participate in RBF or not.

Which would support either theory. Remember the "first" real commerce was laszlo's pizza transaction in May of 2010. Before that the only bitcoin transactions were through markets, faucets and people screwing around and learning the system. So what did miners do at that time with there Bitcoins if they wanted to keep them? Pretty much nothing.... they let them sit. So the question is how many of the UTXO's from before 2010 are coinbase transactions with lost keys as opposed to transactions that just have never moved because a miner from 2009 could just use his 2011 coins?
Edit: Removed something. :)

SPV clients can be tricked by a malicious node in a number of ways into thinking they have received bitcoin that doesn't exist or have no confirmations (when they do). Additionally, if there is partitioning attack it's possible that half the network will be on one fork and the other half will be on another. Those types of attacks become more likely when there are fewer nodes.
There are privacy attacks (traditional SPV wallets provide almost no privacy, the alternative is to query a centralized provider which also isn't great). Fewer nodes makes it easier for surveillance to perform traffic analysis.
Then there's the systemic risk. Nodes that are only run by easily identified individuals or businesses can be shut down. Without being able to keep at least some nodes available through Tor or VPNs makes it easier to shut the network down wholesale.
There's about 5 other things I can think of, but honestly why do they matter? We have seen numerous digital monies fail before. If they get large enough they get shut down by the state and their owners are either jailed or pay heavy fines. The only reason it hasn't happened with Bitcoin is that it was designed to prevent precisely that failure. The new attack is embrace, marginalize the people defending the mechanisms that protect Bitcoin, and extinguish. It's death by a thousand papercuts.

You have to sign it with your private key and then broadcast it to the network somehow. How you get your private key depends on what client you are using. Don't post your private key here, btw or someone will try to sweep it.

Why would it need to be? There's are multiple options for a non-mining full node to limit its bandwidth (limit the number of incoming connections, run blocksonly, etc.). A few hundred extra milliseconds latency for a non-mining node is not going change much since pretty much all miners do not depend on the larger p2p network for receiving their block announcements.  I do agree that something like "thin/weak/IBLT/relay network" is useful. It's a solution to a problem that we don't currently have, though. Funnily enough, it would probably would have been more useful early on. Hopefully (if mining ever gets to be decentralized well enough again) it will be useful in the future.
@_date: 2016-02-26 20:43:48
This is a good innovation, but it always comes along with the propaganda that this will reduce orphan rates completely ignoring most miners don't use the wider p2p network to receive new block announcements. Also this was clearly vote brigaded: 
(Linking NP then saying it has 4 up votes is about as close as you can get asking for a brigade without asking. Edit: Added np so I won't be as much of a hypocrite.)
Now it's nice, it's good. It may make it where one day miners don't have to rely on other less desirable methods, but it will not signficantly change mining dynamics in the short term.

This will be somewhat unpopular opinion, but I'd go with the Bitcoin Investment Trust route for that amount of money and then put maybe 10% of real bitcoin in a Trezor.
If you have to ask this question on reddit, you aren't ready to store $100,000's of bitcoin on your own. If I were to do it on my own... I would probably use at least a 2-of-3 multisignature setup and SSSS (Shamir's Secret Sharing Scheme) with one key, trezor for another key, and third key in a trust or bank vault. That's not even worrying about how I would have to generate the private keys. It would protect me against most types of coin loss and theft, though.

To be fair, I don't think the development will be that hindered if 2MB went first vs Segwit - but it's clear to me from a deployment standpoint that Segwit should come first. No matter what, I think SW and 2MB will be deployed before LN actually comes to fruition. There's multiple people working on LN now, which is really hopeful. I'm still not 100% going to jump on the LN bandwagon until I see it deployed.
That said, I'd love to see payment channels more frequently used.

Bitcoinj relies on majority of connections to relay an unconfirmed transaction (I think, would love to be corrected), but a Sybil attack with node spoofing is within reason to perform especially since it doesn't have to completely "surround" the client, just be the majority. It is interesting that Peter Todd's wallet now isn't opening either. Reminds me of some tools that would crash computers when they had certain instant messenger clients installed on them back in the 90's.
Of course, PT tends to overplay the viability of attacks. The problem is that tiny attack A may not be useful, but attack A+B might be more so. It's like watching crypto algorithms break slowly... especially if you don't fix them.

A few things about this idea (it's not as bad as it sounds, but it's still a bad idea):
* The proof of passport idea was proving ownership of a unique piece of smart property - Mike felt that passports were the most likely to be used like this in the future.
* Proving ownership of a passport would not leak details about that passport (uses zkSNARKs)
* IIRC (I'm not watching this video again), this was a way to prevent Sybil attacks on nodes as well as his SPV wallet software.
All well and good. :) The one caveat:
* The one organization that could perform a Sybil attack with impunity with this would be the issuer of the smart property: the government. I don't think they could use it to deanonimize nodes, but I haven't looked that hard into the crypto.

I plan to run a 0 fee node for as long as possible. I can imagine that initial data rates will actually be quite low so it just makes sense from a network health standpoint (I think actual resource costs will be as low or lower than a bitcoin node for a while).
@_date: 2016-02-05 01:37:42
Being open source is necessary, but not sufficient. Consider how Bitcoin core does things with their releases: 
They use a deterministic build process, use digital signatures where it makes sense and then they compare (at least) 3 different signer's builds - then they consider it safe to release (I'm skipping a lot of steps). 
If you don't have open source code, you can't even get past step 1. 
Closed source software is often times (but not always) a disaster when they deal with crypto: 




And to answer your question how is it verifiable? It's never going to be 100%. There's so many ways software can be backdoored: 
That said, in these kind of systems making a good faith effort towards improving your security (if it's not already hopelessly broken to begin with) is welcome.

True enough. Mining privately may protect for some time but it's usually pretty easy to link blocks mined by the same miner even with different pay outs. Same way browsers have fingerprints so do miners. A hyperconsious miner might be able to prevent it from happening, but it would be pretty extreme. I'm not sure how I even got on this tangent. Suffice to say this isn't an improvement in efficiency like a new manufacturing process, is a break in the underlying crypto design being exploited. It should be fixed.

I really wonder how many NSA triggers I've tripped online trying to find out an answer for this. I couldn't find the answer, but it seems to between "a lot" and a "shit ton."
To give you an idea. The United States M0 (physical cash) according to FRED is around 4 trillion dollars (up from 800 billion since 2008). If we assume all of that is in 100 dollar bills, it works out to being 40 million kilograms of cash. China reports it's foreign currency reserves as 3.9 trillion, some of that is gold, US dollars, Euro, etc. As far as I know, that has to be physically present in the country, but that might not be true. Regardless if they only have 1 million killograms worth of US dollars in reserve and they accumulated it in say 30 years, they must transport 91 kilograms per day of US cash to make that happen.

 - some historical reference.
It seems apparent that Satoshi was not aware of Wei Dai's work preceding his and it was actually Back who pointed him in that direction (before source code and the public release of the white paper). It was Satoshi that reached out to Back about opinions, so I think it's perfectly proper to think of Adam Back as a Godfather or at the very least mentor to bitcoin (I'd include Chaum, Wei Dai, Hal Finney, Szabo and a host of other people with that title as well).

Well, the ASICBoost paper only covers the "overt" form, so if other manufacturers were using this technology that means they figured out the "covert" form independently or there was some data sharing.

@_date: 2017-04-08 16:57:54
My thought: the blocking covert ASIC boost BIP is a UASF. It's also much simpler and should only be controversial to those that are already using it covertly. It's my opinion that this should be fixed in short order and with as little delay as possible. Segwit UASF controversy can only ever be equal to or higher than ASICBoost UASF alone. After the covert asic boost fix, segwit controversy can only be lower in either a miner signalled activated fork or UASF.
I'm not opposed to UASF in theory. One of the big problems with either approach (bip9 or UASF) is that they can only be a proxy to what the economy wants and thus carry risk if that proxy does not truly reflect.
@_date: 2017-04-06 05:56:01

Honestly, they weren't even on my radar as they are closed source. As a general rule of thumb, if I seen an article per day on a service (e.g. Paxful) or product (e.g. Samourai) on reddit which is overly positive, I get very suspicious. Don't trust, verify. Then still don't trust until people smarter than you also verify. Not all bitcoin services have to be open source, but wallets do. There's no way you can make me trust your wallet for any more than $20 worth of BTC if you don't keep things verifiable and open source.

Because the implementation of fraud proofs require it, but segwit itself has other advantages.

I'm thinking this is the scam setup:
* Make two companies. One registers a bunch of patents. The other is a "private equity fund." 
* Advertise to marks that this fund is looking for a few more investors to complete a $300 million dollar purchase of the first company. They've already raised $275 million from other investors, and they only need just a paltry sum of $25 million to complete the acquisition. Of course, the $275 million doesn't exist.
* A number of people fall for the scam and raise the amount needed. After all, patents which underlie all "blockchain" tech should be worth billions right?
* Begin to patent troll... hope that cases are settled out of court rather than fought. Invariably, the cases will get thrown out. Investors/marks get nervous and try to get some of their equity out.
* By this time be on a beach in a country with no extradition. Hope the investors are too ashamed to try to figure out how to get to you. Alternatively, have your own dirt you can use to blackmail them with to keep them from coming after you.

Even if well adopted, I wouldn't think it would shave many transactions off the blocks (might be opposite, as Rusty has said in the past... if LN or any of these Layer 2 options takes off, it might put more pressure on the system if outside adoption picks up as a result). It seems to be like the "old on-blockchain micropayment channels" + taking advantage of CLTV as well. Seems to me they at least have some vision.

Good points and I don't have time to respond point by point, but I'll say that the speculation occurring from "both" sides (insomuch as their are only 2 sides) is exactly why I think that increasing node costs to the point where it's untenable to run a home node is a bad idea (currently). If we are speculating, then we don't know very much. I'm happy to have a blocksize increase. I'm less happy about a HF, though I could find myself agreeing with one in the future. Since segwit (SW version) is a increase, then I'm naturally going to be inclined to choose it over a HF increase. We can go around and around on this, but I'll simplify it. You said:


Unfortunately, I do not believe that the people that need higher security or privacy will necessarily be able to afford it into the future. Not only that, but those properties are socialized into Bitcoin. They get worse the less people are using them correctly. We have seen Tor run into the same problems, though arguably their use case is higher stake. Almost none of the third-party software was using change address correctly up until about 2 years ago. The solution is not to push more people on to using software that is not safe.
I have talked to a few people on the analysis/forensics side of Bitcoin and they are incredibly confident in what they can do with how the system works now. They are less confident if things like encrypted p2p layers and coinjoin are introduced. I want these things to happen before mass adoption occurs. I want it to be ready for the big leagues.
Personally, I'm not really that worried. Everyone can argue, but I know a lot of other long-term holders which are very quiet want the same things for Bitcoin. I'll be happy to support a fork which does carry those properties even if it is not the highest market cap, but I think the most likely outcome is that that the market will always support the fork (if it comes to that) that has the true longterm viability. 
My perspective is coming from someone that used to be mechanical engineer that went into a medicine. I think a lot about negative/positive feedback loops and watch as many plans lead to unintended consequences. With Bitcoin, after examining the evidence for years, it's become evident to me that the people trying to make drastic and urgent changes have almost always got something wrong. The tenacity of the need for a HF in the setting of already ready to deploy increase with significant engineering time behind it makes me think that their motives are ulterior. Personally, I see malleability as a huge blocker in progress on all the fronts (scalability, security, privacy). If there was never a way to fix it with a softfork, I would have been happy to support it as a hardfork. Fixing it makes it easier to make progress on all fronts *without making significant tradeoffs*.
In engineering, we often throw safety factors into our calculations. They are pretty much the "I don't know what I don't know" of engineering. Elevator needs Y cables X tensile strength? Better make it 3Y and 3X - oh that will change our weight calculations, let's recalculate. Medicine is similar, but often comes in with things like this: If I give 1L of fluid that won't help perfuse the tissues in a septic shock patient, but if I give 5L then I could put them into heart failure. Bitcoin is a field that has a lot of moving parts and arguably more complicated than any one person can understand. My perspective is mirrored here: 
Thanks for the discussion, though. I'm not going to give up on you or Bitcoin just yet. :)

All micropayment channels and LN are implementations of surety bonds. Satoshi at the very least knew that he was lacking some of the implementation in the first version of bitcoin. You can see it in the source code:

RBF doesn't require consensus (as in consensus protocol) changes, so it doesn't necessarily require consensus (as in agreement from most/all parties). RBF does not require a soft or hard fork to implement. It's a node policy. Anyone anywhere can merge it and build the software and even if they were the only node running RBF it would not cause a network fork. Sorry to be so tautological, but need to make that as clear as possible since some people seem to misunderstand this point over and over. That said there was not consensus of devs on FSS or "vanilla" RBF, so they went with opt-in RBF, which AFAIK did have "developer consensus." That will put a little onus of work on the merchants (Bitpay/Coinbase), but honestly I can't see that being more than a few lines of code to detect. Did I get this right, @_date: 2016-02-03 14:35:11

tl;dr (from his conclusion):
As computer scientists and cryptographers, we are twice
culpable when it comes to mass surveillance: computer science created the
technologies that underlie our communications infrastructure, and that are now
turning it into an apparatus for surveillance and control; while cryptography
contains within it the underused potential to redirect this tragic turn.191
Authors and filmmakers, futurists and scientists, have laid out many
competing visions for man’s demise. For example, Bill Joy worries about
nanotechnology turning the biosphere into gray goo, or super-intelligent robots
deciding that man is a nuisance, or a pet.192 I don’t lose sleep over such
possibilities; I don’t see this as our likely end. But a creeping surveillance that
grows organically in the public and private sectors, that becomes increasingly
comprehensive, entwined, and predictive, that becomes an instrument for
assassination, political control, and the maintenance of power—well, this vision
doesn’t merely seem possible, it seems to be happening before our eyes.

Ok this is fun.
So A = Alice (user), E = Emma (barista), X = Xavier (exchange)
B, C, D are hubs.
Alice (A) is a fun working girl in New York City who buys a lot of coffee. Every day she goes to the coffee shop to buy a cup from Emma (E). She uses her lightning equipped smart phone which automatically selects a route among a group of hubs and pays Emma (in the simulation all of the hubs charge the same fee, so the route is chosen randomly, in the real LN the hubs would likely have dynamic fees).
Each of the lines connecting each hub has a number at the end of it, and those lines represent how much is tied up in the payment channel. At the beginning, Alice has $200 tied up between two channels and each hub has $600 tied up between three channels. Every LN transaction that passes through one of the hubs gets charged 0.5%. Every time Alice runs out of money she has Xavier send her more money through the network (Xavier could be substituted by Alice having her own Bitcoin). Each time Emma gets &gt; $100 then she sends $80 worth to Xavier (who presumably converts it to fiat and transfers it to her bank account).
This is very simplified and not exactly representative of the envisioned lightning network. For example, the LN devs are planning to make it where B, C, and D are going to be routed similar to the way the Tor network is where they know nothing of the origin or the destination of the payments.

This made a few brain cells fire: 
I do share Gavin's opinion on this. PoW may not always be the best, but I see no evidence that we are anywhere near finding a suitable replacement. I'm starting to think maybe we should start moving towards a RPOW system/smart property. The problem then becomes issuance (that and community consensus). Good thing we have a number of years to think about this problem.

Doubtful except for what's already out there (antpool with its higher proportion of empty blocks). I expect the only way to prove it conclusively is actually be allowed to examine the operation directly (which is not going to happen). Edit: Hope I'm wrong though.
Interestingly, I think Bitfury and a couple others pools are probably the only miners we can "rule out" as using ASICBoost... not because they couldn't use it covertly, but they almost never produce empty blocks. So, that stands to reason that Bitfury is either forgoing the "cheaper" covert ASICBoost method and only using the more "expensive" method OR they aren't using it at all.

The innovation they made was they figured out how to do it covertly. The actual innovation was something already known, but couldn't be used without licensing. Since China has rather lax IP laws this gives a advantage not based on just innovation to Chinese miners. Additionally, this behavior blocks significant improvements to Bitcoin. I think it should be fixed, but I can see how there might be some disagreement in the how.

Hmm, I think you are saying that Jihan is acting rationally. I agree. It's completely rational and imperative that he took this advantage as a miner.
It's also rational to fix both the overt and the covert forms of ASICBoost, because it makes the PoW operate in a way that it was not designed to operate. Essentially, the bitcoin engine is still running, but one of the valves is stuck. It should be fixed. The quick fix is to oil up the valve, the long fix is to replace it. The quick fix is to fix to covert form (since it causes more problems), but eventually the overt form should be fixed too (since it adds more transistors to the die and uses up space that may one day be used for something else).
@_date: 2017-04-06 03:59:34
I suspect the only manufacturer that's taking advantage of this is Bitmain. I suspect other miners will start to take advantage of it quickly if they can jerry-rig their equipment to do it, but because of the way to implement it, it's probably not easily possible (requires a somewhat powerful FPGA controller connected to the hashing ICs if I understand correctly). Miners using Bitmain equipment hopefully will be able to figure out how to unlock it as well. Their advantage, even without this BIP, will likely disappear soon. 
Edit: This BIP would ensure a lot of the turmoil gets stopped before it gets started... I support it on that reason alone.

Yeah. Basically it is an escrowed transaction which uses the network as the arbitrator (other uses apparent as well). It's nice because the transaction itself isn't a big behemoth of a program. Most of the computational lifting is done by the individual parties involved, so it's a scalable solution as well.

Honestly that why I give it some credence. Luke seems to be the most hardline in all of this. If he thinks it's a reasonable plan then I'm interested in seeing the code. While I empathize with maaku's position that these kind of meetings set an ugly precedent I really hope that this meeting centered more on education than actually reaching a "consensus" as it's currently framed.
We have some real cultural differences in how power structures are understood between eastern and western societies - these kind of meetings should take place just to help develop that perspective. I'm hoping that's the education that people like Luke Jr. and Peter Todd come away with. I also hope the miners came away with knowledge of what services they actually provide for Bitcoin.

If you see how many .99 nodes are in the network you wouldn't be surprised by this.
It is possible to prove that they are compiled from the source (to as much as a reasonable extent as regular core binaries can be proved to be compiled from the source) using a similar process as what core uses with Gitian/deterministic builds and a signing ceremony. It's my understanding that people are working on that.

Their future depends highly on Bitcoin maintaining it's censorship resistant properties. The most important part of this is that all those chains can be traded without a third party using atomic cross-chain trading because they all link back to Bitcoin.

They've still got a lot of development (years) to make that happen though.

I think you're mixing your personal beliefs on systems of governance (which you and I generally agree with) with what is good cryptographic design. In this case, and in any other system, this would be considered a design flaw in a cryptosystem. The intention of a PoW unit (hash) is that expenditure is the same across all hardware in regards to cost. Naturally, we can't make this happen since computer hardware generally always gets better. Things like moving from CPUs-&gt;GPUs-&gt;ASICs can't be prevented, but can be designed for - and in fact Bitcoin's design fixed that problem (for the most part) with the difficulty change algorithm. Does that make sense?

See that's the problem though. Who should be responsible for changes in the consensus code? It's one thing to be able to make a consensus compatible node (admittedly that's difficult). It's quite another thing to make changes to the underlying consensus code in a way that's "beneficial." Remember Bitcoin is just a few parameter tweaks away from BBQCoin or Dogecoin.
The understanding of what is driving Bitcoin consensus is being explored by the academics. People like Andrew Miller and Emin Gun Sirer. Then there are others that have been thinking about these problems for quite a long time (they were "born" in it, in an earlier era): 
Also how many times did your node fork from consensus or not accept valid blocks accepted by bitcoin-qt in the early days? I seem to remember a couple of times, but I could be thinking of blockchain.info.
You are very confident in what you're doing which is great, but you have a lot of other smart people (many with PhDs, if we are going to use degrees as a measure) that disagree with you vehemently.

I don't believe that's true, although I haven't delved into the nitty-gritty details of bitcoin. You can make a transfer of any amount without a transaction fee at this point (correct me if I'm wrong). It's trivial for the machines that are mining the next block to handle the transactions, and the volume of a transaction doesn't really affect the computational "work" that needs to be performed significantly. 
For example: [Block 173312]( had 0.049 BTC of transaction fees made from 162 transactions involving a volume of 4500 BTCs. That means the mean transaction fee paid  was .3 mBTC for those 162 transactions because most people are choosing not to pay any transaction fees (which should and probably will change in the future, but the transaction fees will be scalable just as easily as those 21 million BTC are). 
Edit: I just noticed that the default client did have a minimum 1mBTC tx fee, but that was changed to .5mBTC. My original point remains that as the value of the bitcoin changes the value of the transaction fees can change - that is not set in stone.

I had to Americanize the date on there, sorry about that...
I wanted to point out a couple of things in this post since I think they parallel some of the concerns we are currently going through regarding the lightning network (and also to point out some ideas of Adam's that have been rather... long held).
In this post he's comparing and contrasting some of the existing and non-existent systems of e-cash. B-money actually is probably the closest "idea" of a cryptocurrency in many ways to Satoshi's (in fact Satoshi says as much in emails to Wei Dai). So with that in mind there's a few points that I think Adam brings out that are relevant to the current growing pains we are going through:


payment systems (rationals from 1 - 1e6) is to discuss systems which
try to work towards the requirements for a payment system which:


- **has lower barriers to entry**
- has no central entities which need to be trusted
- is difficult for governments to manipulate through hidden taxes


especially), require double spending databases (seems inevitable with
software systems), and **probably not suitable for very low value
transactions.**  But nevertheless I think a departure from the banking
mindset (trust the bank), towards systems which avoid the need for
risk management overheads, and where the whole system is distributed
are interesting to explore.
All emphasis mine. Pretty stable opinion if you replace bitcoin with "b-money." He goes further though:


As I think I said in an earlier post you can mix currency systems, eg
you can use micropayment systems like say micromint, or millicent
backed with b-money, where the value is small enough that the
recipient is willing to take the risk of non-payment.  In Wei's
protocol description b-money is psuedonymous because the identities do
not have to be related to real world indentities.  You could also back
a chaumian ecash system with b-money, and perhaps in a way where the
mint need not be trusted too much, by the value of circulating ecash
coins and b-money coins backing them could be openly auditable, or
better that the opportunities for the mint to cheat were
cryptographically restricted.
Now this is interesting. He mentions using b-money as a way to back a chaumian e-cash or another system of micropayments... he even goes as far as to say that you could use "cryptographic restrict[ions]" to make sure the micropayment system is kept in check.

From bitcoin's wiki:


If you consider the cent as the atomic unit of the US dollar, that would make your example have 76,000,000,000,000 atomic units, several orders of magnitude in difference. Additionally, even if the bitcoin economy really does take off and units need to be subdivided further, it could be with a change in the software.
I agree that your first point does have merit. However, I think that it is highly likely that a cryptocurrency will become a solid store of value and instrument of commerce. It's not there yet. It may not even be bitcoin, but I am 90% certain that it will happen. I only have about $50 worth of bitcoin and I agree that the market is unstable, could crash, fold, et cetera. I am not about to put the majority of my holdings in bitcoin, but even having a little skin in the game makes it interesting. If bitcoin crashes and another cryptocurrency comes along, I'll probably buy some into that. I am investing in the **idea** of cryptocurrency rather than bitcoin itself because it offers a functionality that doesn't exist elsewhere.
That said, creating a cryptocurrency where early adopters aren't the ones that benefit would be exceedingly difficult, if not impossible without having a centrally issuing authority (which is one of the "features" that I think makes bitcoin a good idea). The reason should be self-explanatory.

This is the winning comment right here. The ASICBoost method, as the one specifically spelled out in the ASICBoost paper... is the overt method. The next sentence spells it out even more explicitly - "patented way." Well that's not how patents work. If you make a significant improvement on a patented technology, your improvement may be patent-worthy, you still have to license the prior art if the patent hasn't expired. They are not denying using the covert method at all in this statement. In fact, it's worded very carefully (in as much as a Chinese translation can be) to leave them an out if they are exposed. The next play, if other evidence comes to light, will be that their method is "significantly different" than ASICBoost.
Edit: after reading the ASICBoost paper again, I do think their explanation in the paper covers enough to cover the covert way, too.
Actual patent application:

Let's back up since you have a number of things wrong already.


It's trivial to spin up thousands of fake nodes to the point where even if a node picked several to connect to there's a good chance they will connect to only your nodes. You can use different strategies like connecting to different subnets and the like, but this kind of attack isn't that targeted... you are casting a net and catching a few fish. IIRC, SPVs use lists of trusted nodes to get around a lot of this attack vector. That mitigates it somewhat, but also opens other problems (attack trusted nodes and cause real damage)?
The resources to run an electrum server are significantly above a regular bitcoin node. There was a time about 1-2 years ago when it actually seemed like the electrum servers weren't going to be able to keep up with sync. Only through efforts to increase signature validation speeds and the like that they are still a viable method. 


This is true and is concern shared for full nodes and SPV nodes... If you ask the devs they will tell you to broadcast your transactions through Tor or some other privacy system.


This is also true, unfortunately no SPV client (other than the one that's being implemented in Bitcoin Core) does that yet. They rely on bloom filters which provided very little privacy compared to what was originally thought. See here: 


I'm not sure that this is true, correct me if my logic is wrong. If that traffic analysis was trying to collect lots of data on how transactions flowed through the network, increased blocksizes/numbers of transactions would make that data collection vastly more expensive, just as increased nodes would obfuscate it further. But even further, if more and more users were utilizing SPV/Electrum models, that would mean that more and more nodes were functioning as simple endpoints, and gathering data on where those transactions came from would involve substantially more steps(versus people running nodes) for an attacker(i.e., FBI) if it were even possible at all.
Your logic is wrong. It's vastly easier to collect data going through one point, no matter that bandwidth. If you throw a few connections that are meshnet/darknet then it makes it much more difficult to track the source. Ironically, this is one of the false arguments for keeping blocks small. Storage costs are very cheap. Surveying backbone connections on the internet is very cheap (since it's already done). What's not cheap is dealing with the equivalent of guerrilla tactics on the internet. That's the whole point of p2p networks.


Until you can't run one.


It would not only substantially weaken the network, it would likely cause many to just sell their Bitcoin or not use it. Link: 
This is only listening nodes, but based on those, if US lost all its nodes ~30% of all bitcoin nodes would be gone. If the EU decided to follow suit in some way ~60% of all nodes would be gone. This is easily possible with how today's bitcoin node is implemented. A few switches "thrown" at ISPs and all those nodes that are so well connected lose all their connections and have to start over and be reconfigured to get around the (initially simple) firewall. Let's face it, were not all Amir Taaki, we aren't all going to fight the good fight until the last node fails. A state attack from either the US, EU, or China will be exceedingly damaging. It may not cause total failure, but it will be a several year setback. 


Actually, Chuamian ecash is pretty similar to a Bitcoin with few nodes. At the point where only businesses or large mining operations can run full nodes they turn into the "banks" in the Chaumian model. Bitcoin with few nodes has many more attack vectors than a Chaumian ecash. So if you are only going to have a few dozen or a few hundred nodes - it makes more sense to use a system like Chaum designed in the 1980's. I suspect, that what will happen if Bitcoin is only run on large-scale operations, that it will eventually degenerate into just a UTXO database.
When I say death by a thousand cuts, this is precisely what I mean though. Every single one of the attacks I outline has a mitigation - and they almost always involve making a compromise in decentralization in one way or another.
I leave you with another Satoshi quote that I think you'll agree with: 


The lightweight client is not implemented yet, but the plan is to implement it when it's needed. For now, everyone just runs a full network node.
I anticipate there will never be more than 100K nodes, probably less. It will reach an equilibrium where it's not worth it for more nodes to join in. The rest will be lightweight clients, which could be millions.
At equilibrium size, many nodes will be server farms with one or two network nodes that feed the rest of the farm over a LAN.
He made this statement 1 day before he placed the max blocksize code in Bitcoin. He also stipulated that **his** light client "does not need trust" to verify payments. This type of light client doesn't exist yet, and is probably a few years out if it can exist at all. The SPV clients we know today are an invention of Mike Hearn which are **not** the SPV nodes which Satoshi was thinking about. I strongly suspect the max blocksize commit was made so Bitcoin could be kept decentralized until such time that we had the ability to make these types of clients (with strong, encompassing fraud proofs). If they ever come to exist (still an open question), I would have no problem allowing the max blocksize to be 150 MB because at least then we could make sure the gatekeepers to the blockchain actually cared enough to store it.
More food for thought:


This quote happened 2 days before his disappearance. After all the server farm quotes and the like he throws this in there: "Bitcoin users", not Satoshi, makes the decision on the fate of Bitcoin. Satoshi was right in many ways, but I will not be beholden to him as a Catholic is to God/Jesus. He was just a brilliant person. Tesla thought relativity was a bunch of made up bullshit. Einstein thought the beginnings of quantum mechanics just didn't make sense. Satoshi should be treated the same... he's a luminary and his quotes and comments cannot be used to support one side of this debate without acknowledging that he could be wrong. Personally, I think he changed his mind as the network progressed and changed. He disappeared shortly after mining pools appeared which changed the network dynamic significantly, we have no idea how he felt about them (I think Satoshi thought the PoW in Bitcoin was non-outsourceable from the beginning).

It eliminates the need for escrow in certain types of transactions where it would be bad to share information with any other person (state secrets, corporate espionage). Of course it has to be amenable to being able to prove your knowledge in a meaningful way to the buyer. This would cut out the "conscience" of the third party and allow for better deniability. This may not be all that bad alone, but when you start thinking about prediction markets + this + pubpay + CT/CJ... you get some interesting scenarios.

My idea was to make it optionally custodial. The old old tip bot actually gave you an address and it's private key. With the LN bot you could open a channel to pay to it and it could manage non prousers accounts until they want to start their own LN node. Then they could either transfer the state over... Etc...
@_date: 2018-03-24 22:49:53
It would actually be a mix of both those modes. The second type for new tippees that can be converted over to the first type (perhaps required after the custodial balance is greater than X).

Yeah, well were those people helping with Bitcoin?
I actually doubt that Adam Back would consider himself a great "dev." He's a cryptographer and distributed systems PhD. Distributed systems actually have quite a bit of intersection with economics. Additionally, people like Ian Grigg, Nick Szabo, and Adam Back all have prior works that marry economic principles to computer science. Adam Back's work "Hashcash-a denial of service counter-measure" is cited by 248 articles in Google Scholar, many of them pre-bitcoin and a number of them actually being about payment systems predating bitcoin (For example: 
Additionally, Adam Back has been thinking about payment system design for a long time: 
Now, you may say "A ha! see he didn't get anywhere with this stuff and he's been working on it for at least 17 years!" Well, whatever. These guys worked hard trying to get e-cash systems to work and it wasn't the economics that was the problem, it was the government and regulatory environment. An unmolested Chaumian e-cash system would absolutely destroy Bitcoin as a payment system. Unfortunately, it can't exist because power hungry ass-hats always seem to get in the way.

4 mb (0mb + 4mb witness space). That type of block would have to be contrived though, so really somewhere around 3 is more realistic assuming heavy segwit adoption. Of course you can't have a transaction in 0mb, so a contrived block with single transaction with a large witness would be just under 4mb.

"The root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that's required to make it work. The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust. Banks must be trusted to hold our money and transfer it electronically, but they lend it out in waves of credit bubbles with barely a fraction in reserve. We have to trust them with our privacy, trust them not to let identity thieves drain our accounts. Their massive overhead costs make micropayments impossible.
A generation ago, multi-user time-sharing computer systems had a similar problem. Before strong encryption, users had to rely on password protection to secure their files, placing trust in the system administrator to keep their information private. Privacy could always be overridden by the admin based on his judgment call weighing the principle of privacy against other concerns, or at the behest of his superiors. Then strong encryption became available to the masses, and trust was no longer required. Data could be secured in a way that was physically impossible for others to access, no matter for what reason, no matter how good the excuse, no matter what.
It's time we had the same thing for money. With e-currency based on cryptographic proof, without the need to trust a third party middleman, money can be secure and transactions effortless."

- Satoshi
Why would he say phase in? He doesn't ever say remove it... in fact  he says later:


    if (blocknumber &gt; 115000)
        maxblocksize = largerlimit




Again if he thought it could just be removed his pseudocode would have looked like this.
    if (blocknumber &gt; 115000)
        maxblocksize = nolimit
So the million dollar question is... why didn't he write it like that? Just because you put a temporary dam in place before you build your permanent dam doesn't mean you can tear down the temporary one when the concrete on the real one hasn't even dried yet.
I'm not wanting to argue from authority, I want to understand the substance of that conversation he had with theymos/jgarzik.
@_date: 2015-09-04 16:43:50
Who? Almost no one, you're moving ~~fence~~ goal posts. I pointed out that removal of the limit is foolhardy. You cannot account for the unknowable problems that are associated with it. The *myriad* of problems that would have occurred had it not been there makes it much more likely there are also a myriad of unknown problems that still exists.
For example, how many people knew that if you filled a transaction with a ton of inputs it would take a miner quadratically longer to validate a block that contained that type of transaction? Gavin's 100 kb transaction limit was put in place to prevent that attack. Can you imagine if that wasn't discovered and a miner put a 2 MB heavy input transaction in a block? That very obvious problem was fixed, but what about the other ones that *we don't even know about*?
The fact that a blocksize limit was in place *of any size* is more important. Getting the right size is hard and requires research. Or we can just put more fuel into our unstaged rocket and see what happens.

It's certainly possible, but I also don't think it's quite clear that he is "state trained." If you read some of the older Cryptography Mailing List posts (circa 90's, early 2000's) there was many on that list that were very interested in anonymity online... someone with the programming and cryptography chops to actually get bitcoin together would likely be able to accomplish what he did in the absence of a targeted campaign to find him.
(Edit: I do agree with you that once the "eye" was on him he thought it best to disappear. It's interesting that he disappeared at a fairly critical time Bitcoin's development... the advent of mining pools, people interested in DoSing Bitcoin... etc.)
I'll try to pull a link where they talk about publishing anonymously... Satoshi was using the crypto mailing list playbook.

His post seems to be an exercise in privileging the hypothesis in a lot of ways. Has this already been well studied (and not just in average case)? Are you aware of any deeper data on the subject? If not, shouldn't this have been one of the first things studied before taking scaling actions?
@_date: 2015-09-15 13:45:40
It seems likely that Satoshi was wary of standards with magic numbers in them (numbers that could be picked with handwaving that they were truly random)... the secp256r1 curves have "random" numbers that were chosen, the k1 curve is different. He probably didn't know, but k1 digital signatures have a few optimizations as well that make the signatures faster to make. ~~I believe there was a thread where Finney was discussing it in the past and he asked Satoshi in private email why he chose that and the answer was pretty much what was in front of him at the time.~~ (Edit: Memory is a funny thing:   Engineers do that a lot... it's not really laziness, it's more, well... hmm I guess it is laziness. Actually it's more to do when you see a nail and one hammer is laying a lot closer to you and will work, why go find the other hammer that's 3 miles away just because it's a little bit better?
I think the DUAL_EC_DRBG was suspected of being compromised way earlier than was common knowledge (Why put a slower, crappier RNG in a standard with a bunch of other faster ones that don't do handwavy shit?), so perhaps Satoshi was knowledgeable of that. I also think that Satoshi had design help from the cypherpunks (if he wasn't one his self). Back has mentioned a couple times that he had private email exchanges with him and we know Finney and Wei Dai did.
@_date: 2015-09-03 16:32:31
I'm pretty well convinced. :) Looks like the PR was merged, too. I will still have that fear if this turns out to be the scaling solution picked, but I think it's also important to note the minority miners can always produce smaller blocks if they do have connectivity issues (Edit: it will also give them less profit). They just need to have a fairly good downstream ability to prevent themselves from "SPV mining (I hate that term)" too long.

@_date: 2015-09-02 14:08:18
This touches on some interesting things, but I think it's important to point out you can't just scale up transaction rate and make that deficit go away as fast as you did. It's a diminishing return because higher transaction fees will probably necessitate a higher per bitcoin price... meaning the deficit it's making up has to grow as well. Which means there could be more transactions than you are assuming. Important to think about negative externalities, too. Macroeconomics is a different beast that's not easily understood (I'd argue that it not possible to understand it completely, more on that later).
Like it or not there's a real price associated with running the Bitcoin network and someone has to pay it. Garzik's argument for increasing the blocksize now is essentially (paraphrasing) "we didn't do a good job of letting the masses know fees would be increasing, we should delay it a little longer." I think he's right on in the argument. Many of the other devs argument is that security properties must be maintained no matter what, because once the decentralized system is broken it can't be fixed easily. I also agree with that argument. Finding the right balance is where the art and science is going to have to take place.
What I don't agree with is taking the most obvious solution and keep turning it up without adequately addressing the externalities. I've read just about all information I can find on the subject (dev-list, academic papers, bitcointalk dev forum, etc.) and to me no one has all of it figured out. Some are a lot more honest about it, though. The problems are similar to the ones that early rocketry faced... there are obvious simple solutions that are wrong. 
The meta-argument going on is about how big is Bitcoin going to get. If it's going to be a low-throughput system then it needs to have very different economics to maintain security. If it's high-throughput it will require different economics to maintain security. I'd like to see a BIP that addresses both of those realities. BIP100 gets a little closer to hitting the mark than BIP101, but I'd like to see something a bit more automated and less miner controlled. I don't care for the voter mechanism in its suggested implementation and would prefer something a bit more automated.
That said, some of the problems we are trying to address are not trivially automated. Certain things seem to "unknowable" to the network which may be more obvious to us meatbags. For example, let's say there are three mining pools in a city that make up 75% of the hashrate of the network. They VPN out so their GeoIPs look way different. By network topology, they appear to independently acting, but in the meatspace they are in the same area, which would be undesirable. So how do we protect against that? I don't see a great answer, but I have a feeling it's going to have to rely on a federated system of some sort.
Fun times ahead, I just hope we don't get too derailed before it gets really interesting.
@_date: 2015-09-04 15:16:59
You have to design for worse case in these situations. A miner can fill a block with deterministically generated spam known only to him and his "buddies", transmit only his IBLT or block headers to his "buddies" and allow them to dominate a market filled only with SPV and lite clients while the little miners are left validating blocks that may or may not be truly valid. Most nodes today will choke on fairly regular 8MB blocks, Bitfury's numbers (and I've checked their numbers against my own node) do a pretty good job of laying that out.
@_date: 2015-09-03 05:30:27
Not necessarily. It could be a misunderstanding. I had an old email address I completely forgot about until very recently. Or it could be an overly aggressive spam filter.

There is a versionBits field in block that has a lot of extra bits. Which would make it possible to have many different "block" versions. We are on 2 (or 3 depending on what camp you are in). A lot of people think the number of bits for the version field is too much and those bits could be reappropriated for something more useful: 
Masking out the high bits is basically saying: "We know those bits will probably be used for something else, so lets just ignore them to make it easier to be compatible moving forward."
(not going for 100% technical accuracy, just giving you an idea)
@_date: 2015-09-03 15:35:22
It's two separate things. Remember in the old BIP100 where there was date as the time for hardfork? This one gets rid of it and uses the BIP101 (except with different consensus thresholds) method of signaling miner consensus. It's written in a way that makes it a "safer" hard fork mechanism.
If I'm reading it correctly the 75% rule is meant to prevent miners from "jumping the gun" and the 95% rule is to no longer accept lower version blocks (which would include current core and XT blocks).
@_date: 2015-09-29 18:36:42
Yes. Some financial institution profits occur because of frictions in the system (Charge a couple dollars for a deposit, fees from correspondence banking, currency exchange, pay some lawyers and bureaucrats and pocket the rest as a profit, etc.). All of those frictions that are undesirable to the customer are desirable to financial institutions. So long as they all passively agree not to improve things, customers continually getting screwed but have *no other choice*.
What has occurred (currently and in the past) is a price-fixing scheme, whether it be willful or not. The fact that *one bank* telegraphed interest in a better type of settlement/payment system using smarter cryptography means that now all banks are forced to do it. It'll be interesting who's going to be cut out of the shrinking profit pie (lawyers? bureaucrats?) when these systems get implemented.
@_date: 2015-09-09 01:39:39
How do you know we are decades away? And even if we are should we not be thinking through solutions to these problems now? There's only so much human/fiat capital Bitcoin can suck up until it reaches self-sufficiency.
I'd posit we should be getting it right now, especially in these early times when decisions made now can have a long-term effect on the future of Bitcoin's eventual success as a permissionless/immutable system. Otherwise we'll end up with a traditional Chaumian ecash system, which will still be nice, but not nearly as nice as it could be. It's actually a quite nice trojan horse to bootstrapping a Chaumian-like system without having some of the privacy benefits.
Bitcoin should be able to survive as a system where people are putting capital in (not just in a fiat, but man-hours and infrastructure) and when they are taking capital out. The difficulty adjustments are meant to make that work. 
Thinking of it as a system with positive and negative reinforcements of behavior of all participants (miners, nodes, users) is important. That said, I agree that we do have some breathing room until we reach a "steady state" (only using that term as I can't think of a better term at the moment), but a fee market will need to develop in the future and an unrestrained blocksize may incentivize miners to behave badly that are largely undetectable until complete failure is imminent.
@_date: 2015-09-04 19:47:45


I answered it, but I'll rephrase to make it a little easier to understand. The problem is that it's a leading question/false dilemma.


Probably not. I may choose a limit that would be higher or lower depending on what available data I have. The important point is that I would choose a blocksize limit, though.
Now to answer why the question is ridiculous on it's face:
Satoshi made the choice to change something by adding that limit in the first place. Understanding why he did that is integral to understanding why it can't just be removed. Even if it was meant as a way to prevent spam/dust transactions I still don't think we've adequately addressed handling those problems. I believe that if he hadn't of added it, somebody else would have due to it being a rather pragmatic fix to a very hard problem. Gavin argues that we have addressed the problems (or that we can address them as they come up), Maxwell/Back argues that we haven't (and if we address them as they come up, it may already be too late). Garzik is kind of between, but he recognizes that long term security depends on users of the system paying adequate fees to maintain the good security properties.


No. An algorithm that has O ( n^2 ) complexity doesn't mean it has a bug, it means you have to apply the algorithm where there is low n to be practical. (Edit: Also hope you can make a better algorithm). The fact that validating transactions in worse case was and technically still is O ( n^2 ) is warning of other potential O ( n^2 ) problems hiding in the rafters.

Much smoother. Regarding 4(ii): Shouldn't absent votes be votes for the current hardLimit rather than a vote for 1M? If not, why?
My suggestion:
ii. Absent votes are counted as votes for the current hardLimit. Votes below minimum cap (1M) are counted as 1M votes. Votes above the maximum cap (32M) are counted as 32M votes.
EDIT: I swear I didn't just steal that from a PR. Word for word, too. Oh well. Link: 
Other option would be not to count absent votes at all, but I think anchoring to current hard limit may be preferable.

Survival of the fittest in mining may not be best for network though. It's the "democracy is two wolves and a lamb voting on what's for lunch" problem. /still playing devil's advocate.
Edit: I'll clean this argument up a little more:
Miners are meant to compete only based on how much proof-of-work they produce and their ability to follow a "consensus." Adding other factors that they have to compete on (e.g. speed of internet connection) may introduce pressure on the system in such way as to be more centralizing or deanonymizing. Of course, we can't allow a miner to connect with 56kbps dial-up.
@_date: 2015-09-16 17:24:57
That's correct, but there may be two things going on: User (customer) facing systems and systems that are used between banks in a somewhat adversarial condition (learn about correspondent banking and RTGS, etc.). Using a shared ledger system rather than another type of system may have benefits in either case, but it's actually the latter I think most banks are most interested in. What's funny is they don't really even need to use a blockchain system to perform the job. Essentially, they are excited about blockchains because they offer a feature that already existed before Bitcoin. Oh well, at least they are getting off their asses and doing something about it.

Perhaps, and I'm just throwing out numbers, using 3/4 of sipa's rate as the bottom and Gavin's as the top could be possible. Still thinks it might give miners too much leverage. I do think all the proposals have unaddressed problems and we have yet to get to the one which is technically best or the one most likely to get consensus.

I actually took a random sample of 40 nodes on getaddr.bitnodes.io  and tried to figure out how many would be excluded at 8 MB blocks as well... seemed like 3 out of 4 would drop out based on what information I could find about service providers. Not perfect science, but enough to get a back-of-napkin approximation. So that would bring us down to 1500 nodes. Looks like my data at least gets into bitfury's ballpark as well.
I've seen a few different arguments with people when this point is brought up:
* It doesn't matter, we will always have enough nodes to maintain decentralization as long as they are in different jurisdictions, etc.
* We will actually get more nodes because 8MB is much more useful... blah blah... network effect... more people join... more nodes.
* Decentralization is not well defined... those attacks are theoretical and because of free market they won't occur.
In regards to the first one, I don't agree. 1500 is not 1/4th as hard to Sybil or DOS as 6000: P2P network connections grow geometrically with nodes. Not only that, most of the nodes I worry about aren't in the US/EU, they are in 3rd world countries, etc. 
The second argument is silly, too... the people running nodes now are enthusiasts and companies. The people joining bitcoin will use lightweight/SPV wallets, if anything they will put more pressure on existing nodes, not relieve that pressure.
Third one is really sad... it's like people don't know the history of prior digital cash systems. If they do, they think it can't happen to Bitcoin. I feel it's a huge mistake. There is no doubt in my mind that Bitcoin was born out of cypherpunk ideals (whether it be nerds, anarchy, etc.). It wasn't designed to make the existing systems marginally better, it was meant as salvo against them.

Mental poker protocols are to online poker as Bitcoin is to fiat. It's a potentially better way of doing something because you don't need to have a TTP that's interested in making a profit (rake) and doesn't have to use a true RNG. Problem is there hasn't been a successful implementation, but it appears we are getting closer. There's still quite a few problems to solve, though. 
Regarding OP, I think using LN style payments does solve one part of making a true p2p poker system. In fact, it seems like almost all the pieces are "there" now, we just need people who are interested in it. There's probably some clever ways to use SNARKS and MPCs to get it done without revealing hand histories. I'd he more worried about sybils and collusion. Would need a robust lobby system to prevent cheating.

Fact is that Satoshi put it there, and when he was asked to take it out he made some handwavy comment that it could be increased (not taken out) at a later time, without explaining why it was there in the first place (for some reason people assume it was to limit spam, I'm not so sure, but perhaps you could post somewhere Satoshi said that).
If we were using original Bitcoin it would already crashed and burned due to some glaringly obvious exploits.
Regarding this tweet:


It should only be read in context of that Twitter conversation, particularly Gavin's tweet. It's meant as two comments: "quit making apples and oranges comments" AND "Failure to understand the problem means you lose the security properties that protect Bitcoin." It was absolutely ridiculous to compare blocksize to a webpage size and Gavin was being called out on it.


"Argument from authority ("I'm the expert") goes hand-in-hand with the ad hominem ("you're not"). Each may be rebutted by the other, and the average quality as evidence of arguments from authority are about the same as the average quality as evidence of ad hominem. By necessity, these two kinds of evidence are the dominant forms of evidence that lead each of us as individuals to believe what we believe, since little important of what you believe comes from your own direct observation. Authority's investment costs are one good proxy measure for evaluating the value of such evidence. But contrast the law of the dominant paradigm. Perhaps the latter is superior for judging claims about the objective world, whereas investment costs are superior for judging the intersubjective."

I'll try to answer your question in my own words as well: Banks are interested in only a limited portion of "blockchain" tech... the ability to maintain a consensus among peers under less adversarial conditions (though there is still some). Bitcoin is running under more adversarial conditions and also has the mandate (despite what other people want to hear) of it being censorship resistant. All these blockchain things that banks are talking about will only have "full permission" brokered through them. I'd hazard a guess that we won't even be able to read what is on them unless you are a member bank.
The argument then becomes: Does blockchain tech really provide the best fit for what banks *actually want to do*? I'd wager that the answer is no, but sometimes the best fit (a different type of shared database system) may be harder to explain to execs than the "blockchain" which is actually quite trivial to understand at a high level. It's more important to get standard implementations than find the "best" solution some times.

Can we back up a little bit on that? Why do you feel Bitcoin has any value currently?
And for the record, I don't agree that there should be a 1mb blocksize limit, I just don't agree that BIP101/100 (or any other BIP) has proven the case that it should be it's replacement. Limit should be changed, but there's a "Field of Dreams" - "if you built it, they will come" mentality that I don't think I can accept. There is hard science (and a good amount of soft science) regarding this type of consensus mechanism that we haven't got figured out yet.

That's pretty much how I see it as well. Headline should be something like "Banks agree to do something they should have done many years before, better late than never."
They are using "blockchain" as an excuse for executing something that was possible way before, but they had no real incentive to do then. Even if it would have improved efficiency (because their organizations all had the same inefficiencies). Now the game theory is shifting and they all have to jump on board.
@_date: 2015-09-04 14:50:04
Good point, I'll lay it out better than probably anyone of us can (found this while looking for another article of Szabo's):
"A related error is the pure-information fallacy: treating an economic institution purely as an information system, accounting only for market-proximate incentives to contribute information via trading decisions, while neglecting how that market necessarily also changes players' incentives to act outside of that market. For example, a currently popular view of proposition bets, the "prediction markets" view, often treats prop bets or idea futures as purely information-distribution mechanisms, with the only incentives supposed as the benign incentive to profit by adding useful information to the market. This fails to take into account the incentives such markets create to act differently outside the market.  A "prediction market" is always also one that changes incentives outside that market: a prediction market automatically creates parallel incentives to bring about the predicted event. For example a prediction market on a certain person's death is also an assassination market. Which is why a pre-Gulf-War-II DARPA-sponsored experimental "prediction market" included a prop bet on Saddam Hussein's death, but excluded such trading on any other, more politically correct world leaders. A sufficiently large market predicting an individual's death is also, necessarily, an assassination market, and similarly other "prediction" markets are also act markets, changing incentives to act outside that market to bring about the predicted events."

See my edits. I completely agree. Poker is an incredibly fun activity and I'm amazed at how applicable the skills are in other fields. In fact I think p2p poker or gaming may be the killer app, since elimination of the casino (TTP/host) is something all poker players would desire.

It's misleading at best. It's comparing a different network topology entirely (you don't have to send a copy of that page to 20 of your peers at nearly the same time). It's like saying my 351 mustang's engine runs between 0.5-6 Hz vs my phone's 2.6 GHz, and therefore my phone is faster. The units are the same, but the comparison is apples and oranges. The only problem is my example makes it obvious that it's ridiculous, but Gavin's is only ridiculous if you understand the underlying technology.
@_date: 2015-09-08 23:00:30
I think this is why this debate is so heated. Because what I believe is that Bitcoin has value because it is permissionless and immutable (the blockchain, not the consensus mechanism). I actually think you are right as well, but the problem lies in the "peer-to-peer" part of this and what makes the economics of this type of consensus mechanism work.
In the setting of miners, they are paying money to buy electricity and their hashing equipment. They expect to make that money back in the form of Bitcoin. So their profit is dependent on the block subsidy (which is shrinking by design) and the fees associated with transactions. This leads to two different conclusions: you can have a network with many little fees and a lot of transactions or you can have a network with big fees with a few transactions. Both of those cases are acceptable to me, but it sounds like you'll only accept the latter.
So in order for the latter to occur, bitcoin has to become wildly more successful than it already is. Hundreds of millions, if not billions of users have to transact "on-chain" for that to occur. That will likely exclude most nodes-as-hobby people from the network. That's fine, if you can also figure out a way to keep "nodes-for-a-profit" and the "miners-for-a-profit" from turning Bitcoin into Digicash in a piecemeal fashion. That's the crux of the problem. That's where this "fee market" idea is coming from as well.
What I'd like to see in a blocksize increase is a system that is elastic, but does not depend on a vote system. Barring that, I would like to see growth of the chain that as closely emulates the speed of improvement in the worst bottleneck of the system. So what I'm really saying is that I would like a lot more science on the subject.

There's a concept called mindfulness in the mental health field (borrowed from Buddhism) which relies on introspection on why one feels the emotions they are feeling. It's really helpful for a lot of issues related to anger, stress, and anxiety. Even if you really like a topic (such as Bitcoin) it's important to evaluate your emotions about the subject and when it's deletrious to your mental health. If that's the case, time to regroup and regather yourself. If you aren't able to, it might be a good idea to abstain from that topic. In the end Bitcoin may be a great thing, but for the most part no single person's contributions really is going to matter all that much. If it's going to derail, a single post in a forum from anyone is not going to stop the derailment.
Here's a video by CGP Grey that touches on mindfulness without actually mentioning it:

It's a rather insufficient answer. Of course he couldn't see the future, but he could make some educated guesses... he had mentioned Bitcoin supporting many transactions per second, but he puts that in? Why? He also repeatedly works on ways to handle spam transactions in different ways *without invoking a block size limit*. He only puts a block size limit in at the advent of of the slashdotting and posts like this:  (in fact, satoshi commented in that thread 1 day prior to NACKing jgarzik's post). It is kind of funny reading what Theymos posts in that thread, I'm sure you can use that as some ad hominem ammunition if you want.
The concrete is far from dry. There's a reason Satoshi was fearful of onboarding a lot of users shortly before disappearing. Why he asked for a gentleman's agreement to limit GPU mining and why he thought the hornet's nest was kicked when Bitcoin was used to fund wikileaks. He was fearful of growth... and the problems he was afraid of are exactly the problems that are so close to being fixed now, all the while the existential threat of the mob is growing.


You can't prove that because you can't "foresee the future." But you can lessen the chance of it with days of careful analyses and tests which are peer-reviewed and tested. So far the data I've seen (Rusty's work, Gavin's work, sipa's work, Miller's work) is insufficient in proving that since they are often contradictory. Those contradictions need to be explored and tested.

From my understanding, with the OP_CLTV opcode the transaction will already be included in blockchain.

Invertible bloom lookup table: It's a way to share information in a way where you don't have to send all the information if you know the other party has some of the information (such as a shared amount of data in a mempool). It's a way to communicate what's in a block without having to send the whole block.
Paper: 
And discussion (with some critique from Hearn):
Important part of the paper would be Table 2 and: 


the next 6 months. While the immediate drop of the number of nodes is mainly related to RAM and
CPU usage, in the long run there are other limiting factors such as disk space and Internet traffic. For
example, with an 8 MB average block size, a node would require capacity for more than 34 GB of disk
space to process approximately 3 terabytes (TB) of traffic each month.


of other factors influencing the capability of Bitcoin nodes that could not be assessed without a
large-scale modeling.
Truth is somewhere probably a bit better than what BitFury put out though.

I'd argue that one side doesn't want to use the 1 MB size limit, but wants to make sure that the next limit chosen is a good choice. I also feel that it's been reduced to 2 sides of an argument is problem in itself (see here: [youtube link]( since there used to be more diversity of opinion which now seem to be coalescing. Perhaps that's why Gavin did what he did? Most of the rest of your post I can agree on.

Hmm... I think you need to look more into what sidechains and the lightning network are. Sidechains in themselves don't provide much (if any) scaling advantage... at least in the case of the merge mined kind. There was originally some thought they could, but's it comes down to a security trade off. LN on the other hand is described as a "caching" layer which is made up of off-chain transactions that can also be redeemed as on-chain (important detail). That means LN is *simultaneously* on chain/off chain. I'd encourage you to look at Rusty's altcoin work on microtransaction solutions and the dead ends that he met. The reason why he's so enthusiastic about LN is that he thinks it's a solution to microtransaction problems which occur when you consider a cryptocurrency in a steady state.

Importantly, he states it's not about decentralization for it's own sake, it's about the properties required to maintain security. In fact, there was several times when he was making a point on word choice (the use of the word "trustless", etc.) that few would even care to make.

The argument I think you'll see against it: This gives majority of miners the ability to exclude a substantial minority (20%) from participating since they are likely voting based on what their node's connection will bear (ignoring IBLT/Relay network stuff/SPV mining stuff). Perhaps some other percentile (but not 80%) should be used to vote for a decrease... like 50%.

It seems there's no "pure" way to prevent them from forming. You could issue smart property, but that is perhaps gameable and requires some sort of authority/issuer (perhaps a number of oracles?)...
I actually think Satoshi may have disappeared when he realized the project was in better hands without a leader to solve the "hard" problems that were coming.
Also I think he knew some centralization was coming, but he didn't account for GPU coming on so quickly (in fact he asks for the GPU miners to cool it for a little while).
I think Satoshi was fearful of too early success before he disappeared... you can tell by some of the things he posted about on the forums. He didn't want "the eye" on the project for a long while.

My guess is there will be a pie chart, table, or bar somewhere on the client that gives the amount of funds in channels and the amount of funds not in channel (funds that you can use for a traditional bitcoin payment). Eventually people will be more comfortable with letting coins sit in channels ready for instant use and some of the details will start being abstracted away. There will be some churn with channels opening/closing/rebalancing that will need to be handled by the node, but that seems to be likely to be automated early on.

5 is no. It's a softfork. I would suggest eventually moving your cold storage coins to a segwit address maybe in a year or two if you want, but there's really no rush.

I love the CONOP metric, which is something I've touched on in a number of my reddit posts, but I didn't take it nearly that far. I'd be interested to see some quantification of that metric.
One problem is that a well connected node is more expensive to run than a node which has fewer peers, so the CONOP would not just be cost X, but X + Y(n) where n is how well connected the node is. Additionally  it would depend on "where" geographically the node is located (cheaper to host in New York than Zambia). Perhaps taking a sample of CONOPs would be interesting way to "drive" the blocksize.

If you look at the [emails]( to Wei Dai though, he presents it as he had just heard about b-money, though. Of course, Satoshi could have been lying.

Node count means nothing. It only matters if the nodes are economically active. In the case of exchanges that have already adopted using segwit, they will immediately detect a miner trying to spend segwit inputs without correct signature to them as fraudulent. It's impossible for that particular exchange to fall for it. In order for your idea to work, you would have to have one exchange that has not already upgraded to accepting segwit transactions and another that has. Then you would have to majority mine one of the most easily detectable 51% attacks in history without the non-upgraded exchange freezing trades.

Let's reverse this a little. Suppose you want to invest in a company as a private individual. You are a lawyer, physician, or person in the finance industry that makes &gt; $200,000/year, but not $100,000,000/year like some of the other people on this list. You do not want people to know that you are throwing $100,000 into a speculative investment because it makes your professional life **way** more complicated. All of the sudden your name is published on a website with the likes of "Eric Schmidt." You've painted yourself a target on your back. The next client or patient you see that's a little unscrupulous decides they are going to sue you because they "know" you're worth it. Or you become the pariah at your firm as the guy who invested in "Bitcoin not blockchain" stuff.
They are probably smaller individual accredited investors. To be an accredited investor you have to have $200,000/yr income x 2 years or a certain net worth requirement. Then you are allowed (by the IRS after registering) to invest in companies looking to raise capitol that are not public. I don't know how much financial privacy they should be allowed, but I don't think a $50,000-$100,000 investment should always be published for everyone to see.
Blockstream got a 21 million dollar investment, so that means on average each investor put in ~$500,000. I guarantee you that the listed investors put in the lion share of the investments. The "several others" are probably accredited investors that don't want their names published because they are private individuals that aren't filthy stinking rich, just regular stinking rich.

I don't think he'll want to return for a while, if ever. Most of the devs have at one time or another had death threats on them and it seems to go in cycles on who to hate. I've watched the subs including We have a cult of personality in these subs and sycophants that clearly shouldn't be leading a bake sale vying for power. They got to where they were by dividing. Valuable contributors have been chased away numerous times simply because they don't agree with 1 aspect of the groupthink. Mods got overzealous with things, but there were a few charlatans that seemed content with making things go nuclear. Fault does not lay with one person, but the mob. Very few people excluded, including mods and devs. We now have numerous devs that are jaded beyond belief.
Bitcoin goes from one crisis to the next. It's been like that every year I've been part of it. Just relax, it's not doom and gloom. This is a high risk, experimental system and mistakes are going to be made.
If you can't see something from other side's perspective, then you clearly don't know enough about the issue. If you aren't willing to formulate your opinion by actually looking for hard data and prefer to be spoon-fed by one of the sub's thought leaders, you're going to end up a drone or burned out due to cognitive dissonance. And for the love of God (or whatever deity) don't attack people who simply disagree with you.

The fact that his attack requires a majority of miners (actually it's less than that, but we'll just keep those numbers) means that it will never happen simply because there are so many other more profitable things that they could do with that power. He's effectively advocating for cutting a money tree down (edit: in the winter, since it requires economically important nodes not to realize, which is going to be pretty close to nil) rather than just picking the leaves off the tree.

I read quite a lot of the academic literature published on Bitcoin. It's interesting for the most part, and helps keep me up to date on the latest ideas. I read Peter R's paper and I found it fairly superficial (perhaps not the right word?) in a lot of ways. That doesn't mean it's without value, just that the broad conclusions drawn from it were overly optimistic. You actually see that a lot in academic papers in discussion sections, they understate problem with methods and overstate the results. I've done a bit of literature review in my career, admittedly in a different topic entirely (medicine), but it's a skill in and of itself and it is hard to do. Separating good science and good methodology from bad is hard and no one gets it right all of the time.
That said, I would have to see the content of his presentation before making any kind of judgment. I do think it's quite weird that he had verbal confirmation then a written rejection. I do think the stated reason for this conference is to get down to brass-tacks and have real in-code implementations presented. I think it will quite evident by the content of the conference whether Peter's publication belonged or not. I don't think a governance lecture is wanted or needed at this conference. Consensus will not form around removing the limit entirely (why was it put there in the first place? /rhetorical question), nor do I think it would be wise.

You could also produce two separately valid transactions that are mutually exclusive as well. Essential set up a double spend transaction and make sure only one of the networks "sees" one version. You could do it as Finney-style double-spend as well for a little extra security. Edit: Have to get them close to simultaneously confirmed, otherwise another actor on the network A could see the transaction in the new block on the network B and then try to get it included.

As a doctor, I pretty much agree with this assessment. May be a bit hyperbolic, but over prescription of opioids is terrible in my profession and is actively encouraged with this pain is a 5th vital sign/patient satisfaction/pay for performance junk. Plus patients love it and pharmaceutical companies love it. Many docs don't like being yelled at by belligerent drug users so they give in too frequently. Others are making money off it.
That said, illicit opioid use increases when legal routes are limited. The problem is multifactorial.
The fact that they go for these limited users of the internet darkweb (who in general fall in the functional abuser/user categories by necessity of being able to use Tor, etc.) is certainly a waste of resources.

I always find it interesting they don't bring up projects that reimplement bitcoin in a different language (btcd) or projects which change the user experience in a way that does not affect consensus (LJR/Knots). Even the out there stuff like "The Bitcoin Foundation" (not the usual one) provides a contradiction. It's like those projects (which predate XT/Classic) don't even exist. Fact is that altering the underlying consensus mechanism is really hard politically, especially when it involves the protocol becoming more permissive. It's meant to be that way and in fact derives much of its value from that premise.

Tonal is like an esoteric version of hexadecimal that was proposed before computers existed. It doesn't use A-F, but rather symbols that are invented specifically for the tonal system. It's actually pretty interesting in a nerdy esoteric way. There's a number of benefits from a base16 system over a decimal system. If you learn to think and count in base16 it makes certain types of math problems much easier to perform (or even possible to perform - see:  Humans likely used base10 historically because that's how many digits we have, but there's not anything particularly graceful about that base when it comes to natural systems.

Perhaps you should consider some a little more fundamental in the crypto landscape?
At that level, perhaps just make a proof-of-work (see the hashcash paper:  the C source would not be too difficult to navigate through at your level) implementation in Java. It's an important part of Bitcoin. You could select a hash function to use  and test the results of your computer ability to "mine" hashcash.

There's a documentary on Netflix called "Sour Grapes" (spoiler alert) about a young wine dealer/scammer who would recork wines and sell them as authentic to well-to-do clients. It's really pretty interesting because near the end of the documentary, one of his marks who had bought from him **still believed** that he had bought authentic wines from him despite the guy being caught with an entire **house** filled with counterfeiting paraphernalia (numerous aged labels, corking equipment, formula notes, etc). It's amazing the level of delusion people will fall into once they are taken. Their denial seems proportional to how much they've been taken for as well.
I always found it funny that Bitcoin itself sounds like a scam. Any reasonable person *should* first be very skeptical based on it's initial description. Ironically, the people that supported it without understanding any of the technical nuances (at least to some degree) are pretty good marks to be taken by other scams. That probably explains much of the early ecosystem. It's almost a rite of passage to be scammed in the cryptocurrency space.

A bitcoin address is a RIPEMD160 (160-bit) hash + checksum and formatting of an ECDSA public key (256-bit). Therefore, by the pigeonhole principle, there are a large number of public keys which correspond to a bitcoin address (there has to be collisions).
(Edit: I realize that you were correcting me on something else entirely different. I was answering his statement "Would like to hear from somebody who can speak to whether it is possible to have an address for which no private key is possible." - which I was saying is probably not. When he restated the question he made it a negative of that statement, which would be answered with "probably yes.")

This is a good idea. I have two objections, though. Most "professional" online poker players using tracking software or keep notes to develop their strategy against certain kind of players across games (e.g. VPIP/VFR), some might not like that part of their metagame removed. I actually don't see much of a problem with that. The second objection would be that using anonymous IDs might make it easier for the house to introduce it's own players in a table without being detected. I would bet their's a few countermeasures that could be employed against this.

That's part of the problem. Core is not your master or mine. I'm not sure if I support BIP148 (I do support UASF, but the design of BIP148 is too aggressive and quick I think). I do, however, think that the meme that miners run the show needs to be killed with fire. I want something that proves it decisively and BIP148 was about 75% there before some people decided to make it a LEEROY JENKINS moment. I hope it works out though. 
I generally support what core is doing. I believe segwit and the scaling roadmap (even with an eventual hardfork) is the right way forward, but we should be prepared to reject software that we don't want to run no matter the source.

So TCAM is limited to 1 MB on many cisco routers. This effectively limits the size of the BGP routing table. It doesn't matter if it's specified in the RFC documents or not, it matters how it's implemented. The fact that there is no reference documentation for Bitcoin other than code being run is effectively the same principle. If you get the thousands of people that are using Bitcoin core to change their systems without forcing them to then great we'll have a higher blocksize limit. That said, when I see development activity and where people are contributing, no amount of bloviating is going to change the fact that there are 28 people contributing on this pull request alone: 
compared to the entire sum of developers on the other projects:
which may number ~10 and that's being generous.
If I'm WayBetterThanCisco routing company and release a system which has a larger BGP routing table then I better be sure I can replace the entirety of the Cisco installed base when the orders come in.
Edit:  I believe this may have been the nidus from which Gavin's latest blog post centers. I knew I had seen this before, but I didn't have time to look through his comments when I posted.

You're of course correct. What I should have clarified (but didn't because I was on mobile) was that some of the mental poker protocols allow colluding players to exploit more information out of a hand than they would if they were normally colluding (they would not only know their hands, but have a very good idea or an exact idea of what your hand is as well). There are some protocols that limit the benefit of collusion to what you would expect in "live" poker.

The transactions had about 2 decades of history in the CS literature at that time. The problem was so solved (by Chaum, etc.)  it wasn't worth talking about. Script was a pretty interesting solution, but satoshi spent no time in the whitepaper explaining it at all. The entire whitepaper is about adding inflation control (it also makes an effort to hit wishlist items that were known, for example allowing nodes to leave and join at will). It talks very little about the mechanics and focuses on the high level problem that people had been struggling with since the late 90s.

There were numerous mailing list threads in the late 90s early 00s trying to figure out how to use hashcash as a ecash... The only problem that people repeatedly ran into was inflation control (or the double spend problem, which is really the same problem). So yes, bitcoin is hashcash extended with inflation control... its just that the inflation control problem was actually really hard to solve.
His quote is like e=mc^2. Easy to say, but deceptively difficult to understand. It's actually a good litmus test.
For further reading:

They can up until the point that Core no longer exists, but the existing projects aren't even doing that. They haven't even been able to keep up with the pace of Core's commits (check the marked drop off since december):
Most of those commits are not the "controversial" stuff. They are just run of the mill clean up and optimizations of non-consensus code. (Edit: rearranging deck chairs /s)


I'll bet you 1 BTC (on whatever fork has the higher monetary value) that Core won't without losing at least 2 of the main devs with commit rights. More likely the project work will halt or there will be a simultaneous hardfork with a POW change. Of course, I don't believe it's likely to happen at all without the change being forced by a Goldfinger attack or other bribery/extortion of miners. Don't misunderstand: I'd like to see a future hardfork, not to change the blocksize limit (although it could be included) but for cleanup.

Seems like this would help some types of research fraud and there's ways that this kind of idea could be used to prevent others.
Researchers and pharmaceutical companies sometimes do not publish studies which fail to reject the null hypothesis. This may not seem to be that bad of a problem, but medical researches typically use a p-value of &lt; 0.05 to determine statistical significance. That means that it's possible for a false-positive (Type I error) result to occur if a study is run an average of 20 times even if there is no real difference between the two study arms. If you see one positive in a sea of negative studies, you'll be inclined to say that the positive study is a false-positive, but if you see 2 or 3 studies which are positive, but you don't see the 30 other studies which are negative (which were never published) then you might be inclined to believe those studies. [Statisticians, please don't kill me for this explanation, I'm sure I'm not explaining it quite right.]
This is problematic for practicing physicians because even if we do our job right, we can still make the wrong call because we don't know what we don't know.

* Thread is posted by an account that has never made a topic post to - except the last 2 topic posts - both within 30 minutes of the medium post.
Here's my hypothesis:
There is an astroturfing campaign around this topic. It is being upvoted by people that do not normally frequent this subreddit. I believe that it is deliberately split into 5 separate posts so that its impact can reach the most amount of people.
Often times pharmaceutical companies do randomized controlled trials against older established therapies in an effort to prove effectiveness for treatment. They usually avoid newer comparisons (they don't want to accidentally prove that a competitor's drug is actually better than theirs). Comparing compact block protocol (BIP 152) to this would be more "fair" and significantly more interesting. I believe it's academically dishonest at best to compare the existing p2p system when there is likely to be a deployed improvement soon (regardless of the timeline of the ideas presented). I'd also like to hear about how the possible plan to encrypt the P2P layer would affect the viability of either solution.
Furthermore, in the first part it's stated that "as argued by Cornell researchers, block propagation between nodes is the bottleneck for on-chain scaling" which may be true, but it's important to point out that the cited paper lists a number of other potential bottlenecks. And the thing about bottlenecks is when you improve one, there's a potential for another to take its place. To illustrate think of "turning around" an airliner. Let's say it takes 35 minutes to load passengers and 60 minutes to load luggage and 30 minutes to get fuel. If you reduce the amount of time to 20 minutes to load luggage (the original "bottleneck") that doesn't mean that the plane can leave in 20 minutes, it means it can leave in 35 minutes. If you reduce the people load time to 20 minutes, it still is going to 30 minutes. In each one of these a new bottleneck is in place. A similar concept applies here. Additionally, I believe it's highly likely that Rizun is misrepresenting the position paper (possibly unintentionally). I'd like to hear from one of the authors such as C. Decker, E. Gun Sirer, or A. Miller to see if he fairly represents their position in that paper.

It's a consequence of using standard hashing and digital signature algorithms. ~~There's no standard 160 bit ECDSA, so Satoshi chose the next one up 256 bit.~~ Satoshi chose RIPEMD-160 as his hashing algorithm, probably because it confers some resistance to certain types of theoretical attacks against ECDSA. He could have chose RIPEMD-256 or a different hashing algorithm completely, but it isn't used as much and RIPEMD-160 is more "standard" and "enough." I think he chose RIPEMD because it was developed more in the open, in much of the same reason that he chose secp256k1 instead of r1.
The question you are asking is like asking a woodworker, artist, or surgeon why they chose tool X instead of Y. Their answer will likely be a little simpler than the real reason they chose that tool.

Because lightning cannot work without Bitcoin (or a similar technology). It's the same way payment channels work... you don't "hit" the blockchain until you need to (e.g. opening/closing a transaction). You only need to when someone is trying to cheat you or when you are done transacting. Essentially what the lightning network is doing is trading valid bitcoin transactions among hubs that don't need to be included in the blockchain unless certain failures happen, trust dissolves, or you are finished transacting.
There are problems though which involve the high amount of infrastructure and coding which will have to take place before it's viable and there's some really sticky legal things (which I don't really see as a barrier - it'll be like trying to ban the internet if it becomes successful).

That's a good point. I'm knowledgeable about who testified at UK (the Multibit developers IIRC) and Canada (Andreas Antonopolous) which may be partly responsible for the more sane regulations. I know for a fact that Andreas specifically stressed the need for next-to-no regulations in the Canada senate. In the US Senator Coburn and Shumer (I think) had a hearing on digital currencies, at that time several senators expressed that very little if any regulatory guidance would be coming from legislative levels specifically citing the Internet as an example of where freedoms were allowed to flourish for some time. At that time, the FINCEN officer testified that she felt they had adequate delegated authority to regulate Bitcoin.
Personally, "hands off" approach is the only thing that makes any regulatory sense at this time. KYC/AML already exists at the exchange level. If they "regulate" too hard they are going to be dealing with ring signature-based and zero knowledge cryptocurrencies sooner rather than later.

* Satoshi never deployed SPV clients.
* Of course he foresaw the development of ASICs. He is in threads talking about GPUs. Anyone who knows anything about computer hardware knows that FPGAs and eventually ASICs would be used.
* Many of those quotes have very little to do with mining pools. If you look back in the history of this the first mining pool (created by happened shortly after Satoshi left. The code/infrastructure to develop a "fair" mining pool is fairly non-obvious, so it's certainly possible that Satoshi didn't forsee mining **pools** forming (contrast to what he means by farms).
I'd also think it would be fair to say that the development happened much quicker than Satoshi wanted or expected. He asked the first GPU miners to cool it and he tried to stop people from funding Wikileaks.
Edit: You could ask Slush what he thinks about the state of the art when he made the mining pool. He could be able to put some of this to rest.

Agreed. As a medical provider our systems make banks look like they are trendsetters. Trying to be a young startup in the field of EHR would require many millions of dollars just to meet certain levels of compliance. And the standards themselves are written in a way that benefits Epic/Cerner/GE, etc. Despite all this, data breaches occur way too frequently: 
That's because there are too many attack surfaces to be secured. Blockchain "tech" isn't what is needed, it's sane EHR systems that value security. We need to do away with username/password systems and replace it with two-factor everywhere. We need to keep things encrypted and we need a system (this is where a blockchain could help) that would allow an individual to know when their healthcare records are accessed and how they are used.

The problem with this was the BitLicense was proceeded with a 2 day committee which was convened and people such as Dr. Ed Felton (now Deputy US CTO) and Dr. Susan Athey giving prepared speeches and answered questions. It was live broadcast and I watched the entire thing. They, to their credit, repeatedly stressed that Bitcoin was a young technology and overly burdensome regulation would be ill-advised. Yet, the regulations that resulted (which specifically excluded banks - supposedly since they already were under more stringent guidelines) turned out to be overly burdensome. Several Bitcoin companies had to be shuttered or moved to a different state. Many Bitcoin based companies now specifically exclude NY residents due to there inability to comply with those regulations. The output may have been "garbage", but the input was not.

If you own a farm, there's no protocol to divvy out the hashrate-weighted proportion of the coinbase reward since the entire reward goes to the "farm." The innovation occurred when someone (slush? ribuck?) figured out how to make it happen by using lower difficult PoW/shares to make it distribute proportionally. This kind of decoupled the node from the hash rate in a way that Satoshi's description lacks.
Let me be clear, I don't mean to say that Satoshi didn't know pools were going to happen, I'm just pointing out that a reasonable person can believe that he didn't anticipate it based on the data presented. aquentin's info in reply to socrates1024 is suggestive way more than the quotes you've made, but they were made after the core innovation was presented by somebody else.

Funnily enough, if you look at the Form 990 from 2014 Jon Matonis has a reported compensation of 0 (see page 7).

Can't really blame the foundation as it's probably an LLC that Matonis has setup to avoid higher taxable income.

Not sure on legality, but from a bitcoin network prospective that is a bad idea due to something called the speed of light. They would still be of limited usefulness since they could be used if all other communication with nodes are suspect. Garzik actually had a project where he wanted to launch some cubesats with nodes on them, but I think the project was halted. Ironically, larger blocks would have made it much less viable due to bandwidth limits that cubesats have due to their power constraints and size. Additionally those sats would not be in geostationary orbit so they would be of limited use. And since geostationary orbit is much higher, even if we could get a sat up there the latency would be quite high. 
Still really cool idea with some benefits. Personally I think a packet radio system would be just as useful and nearly as ambitious.

They did address Momentum and Cuckoo Cycle in the paper:


the Cuckoo-cycle PoW. The prover must find a cycle of certain
length in a directed bipartite graph with N vertices and O(N)
edges. It is reasonably efficient (only 10 seconds to fill 1 GB
of RAM with 4 threads) and allows very fast verification. The
author claimed prohibitive time-memory tradeoffs. However,
the original scheme was broken by Andersen [6]: a prover
can reduce the memory by the factor of 50 with time increase
by the factor of 2 only. Moreover, Andersen demonstrated a
simple time-memory tradeoff, which allows for the constant
time-memory product (reduced by the factor of 25 compared
to the original). Thus the actual performance is closer to
3-4 minutes per GB1
). Apart from Andersen’s analysis, no
other tradeoffs were explored for the problem in [37], there
is no evidence that the proposed cycle-finding algorithm is
optimal, and its amortization properties are unknown. Finally,
Andersen’s tradeoff allows to parallelize the computations
independently thus reducing the time-memory product and the
costs on dedicated hardware.


for a collision in 50-bit outputs of the hash function with
26-bit input. The designer did not explore any time-space
tradeoffs, but apparently they are quite favourable to the
attacker: reducing the memory by the factor of q imposes
only √q penalty
What (I think) they are claiming is that the basis (Generalized Birthday Problem) is well studied and less likely to be found to be lacking... and they introduce this "algorithm binding" thing which I haven't any idea what they are getting at... probably have to do a lot more reading. Perhaps a way to take any NP problem and turn into a PoW?
Is there a online journal club for this kind of stuff?

I think a large part of it is a cultural thing. As Garzik points out, many in Japan didn't contribute back to linux due to the way respect is handled in their culture. We should all try be be civil, the problem is that being civil in one culture may be a little (or a lot) different than another. We shouldn't exclude people just because of personality, unless it's strongly detrimental. The problem is deciding where the line is.
Edit: Personality disorders abound in all levels of society especially academics and entrepreneurs (or perhaps they are just more visible). For the large part, they are not easily treated, especially when the affected person has little insight into their condition. At the same time, great ideas often come from deeply flawed individuals. IMHO, exclusion should be reserved only as a last resort.

Looks like thebluematt and gmaxwell helping them, not necessarily "Core". It's in everyone's self-interest that softforks that are universally wanted be deployed in a way that's as least disruptive as possible. It's kind of funny, we now have 3-4 ways that will successfully deploy segwit... seems like almost a sure thing it's going to happen now. Will we have another BIP66 deployment mistake (because of signalling, but not enforcing miners) or will this one go smooth (like CSV/CLTV deployment)?

Segwit capable nodes store the signature of a segwit transaction with that transaction just like any regular transaction. It's just a segwit transaction is designed in such a way that they can be stored by older nodes without that signature data. Segwit blocks are bigger blocks... full stop. They can include more transactions up to a weight limit rather than a blocksize limit. The weight limit is structured in such a way that the mix of segwit transactions and other types of transactions when seen by older nodes never exceeds 1 MB, but can be anywhere from 1 to 4MB to a segwit node (predicted to be somewhere around ~2 MB average based on current transaction mixes). The benefit of segwit transactions is multifold... They are not malleable (huge benefit for things like payment channels and smart contracts), they allow script versions (ability to add new signature types and opcodes without the extreme vetting which was needed previously), and they are easier for the node to process more efficiently. The last part is where the justification for the "discount" as it's termed. Honestly, I believe that that should have been never named discount, but something a little more pleasant sounding such as "scale factor". The fact that a number of people (even developers) seem to think there is now two limits (weight and blocksize) rather than a replacement of one limit for another (weight for blocksize) is extremely disheartening. Entire presentations have been made based on that misunderstanding.
One of the big impediments to segwit adoption when it was introduced was that the people trying to explain it to the lay crowd oversimplified it. They used shortcuts to explain things... which is understandable. You don't talk about up/down quarks to schoolchildren before explaining what an atom is. You start with the bohr model and then increase the complexity as their conceptual understanding increases. The problem is that people learned the Bohr model equivalent of what segwit was and then thought they had enough of a grasp to talk about it. Honestly, I don't feel comfortable talking about it because although I think I have a reasonably good grasp on it, I'm pretty sure I don't have the big picture and details completely straight.

This was the same argument that was used by people to proceed with regulatory guidance which resulted the NY Bitlicense. AFAIK, only 1 company has been able to meet the regulatory burden to comply no doubt at the cost of thousands of dollars. I find this to be entirely specious, especially in the setting of a technology which much like the internet did not have a suitable analog in the physical world. It was often times that startups in the Internet world (eBay, Uber, Yahoo!, etc.) would often proceed with innovation first and then worry about the regulatory environment later. The fact that Bitcoin's growth in early years was almost entirely due to either speculation or black/grey markets also suggests that early regulation should be avoided and certainly not asked for. Knowing this, what defense of your view "they will regulate without consulting you...forewarned is forearmed"? Additionally, what onerous regulations do you think are possible which will be avoided by engaging early with regulators? Which regulators? SEC? IRS? FBI? FINCEN? CFTC? State regulatory bodies? Liquor license bodies?

Some light reading:
* 
* 
* 
Proven to operate as advertised when you present your underlying security assumptions. In the case of Bitcoin (simplistically) the security assumption is that the majority of miners behave honestly (it's actually less than a majority, but that's a different argument). In the case of PoS coins, the mechanism provides little if any security other than "almost all participants, especially the devs, behave honestly." Most PoS coins that don't have a PoW component rely on checkpoints. PoS is essentially a feel good system because it doesn't seem as wasteful, but that "waste" is necessary to actually be BFT. Other solutions exists in academia which rely on different assumptions (as a "true" solution to byzantine generals problem has been proven to not exist). Personally I believe the mining centralization problem has not been adequately solved. That said, I think PoW is the most practicable.
So proven to be resilient to all attacks isn't the bar - it's to make sure your system is built in such a way that it functions as advertised. PoS coins are not decentralized and barring some other discovery, they *never* can be. Yet they are advertised that they are a way to establish a consensus. That's not to say PoS is worthless, it's value is just limited.
Edit: Some highlighted quotes from the first article:


assumptions that may allow virtual mining systems to
achieve security, or to compare virtual mining systems to
computational puzzles in a common setting. Poelstra [97]
presents a survey of the folklore arguments suggesting
that consuming external resources (i.e., burning energy) is
necessary for blockchain security and hence virtual mining
schemes are inherently infeasible. The central argument
– deemed the nothing-at-stake problem – is that virtual
mining is susceptible to costless simulation attacks; it costs
nothing to construct an alternate view of history in which
the allocation of currency evolves differently. Providing a
rigorous argument for or against stability of virtual mining
remains an open problem.
And: 


effective selling point and is a fiercely-defended principle
among many in the community, consensus would be drastically
simpler if we could rely on a (small) number of
designated authorities to receive, sequentially order, and sign
transactions. This would make stability assumptions much
easier to reason about and remove concerns about wasteful
computation all at once. Laurie [69] first proposed using
a designated list of authorities and a standard Byzantine
agreement protocol.
Similar to the argument that large Bitcoin miners are
not incentivized to attack due to their stake in the future
exchange rate, if the authorities earn a small income by
behaving honestly they would have no incentive to misbehave.
Similar options are available for allocating new
funds as exist for proof-of-stake solutions (Laurie’s original
proposal [69] suggested a lottery among the authorities).
Trust in these authorities might further be limited by using
a mutually untrusted set of authorities [69], using social
networks to choose which authorities to trust [108] or
empowering coin owners to choose their trusted authorities
every time they spend coins [24]. Ripple [108] is one of the
few altcoins deployed with this model; however, its stability
argument remains essentially unproven.

I'm in the social pressure group when it comes to this. A well designed database could perform the settlement function of a "blockchain" with many of the same cryptographic assurances, but there was never any incentive to create such a system that worked among banks. They actually make money due to the inefficiencies of interbank communications. The invention of bitcoin actually progressed collective understanding of the mundane details that caused these inefficiencies. When enough people start asking, "Why are we doing it this way?" the answer can no longer be "Because that's the way it's always been done."
My feeling is we are going to have some of these private systems that start using atomic cross-chain trading and pegging mechanisms that will eventually become a loosely linked system. For example, bank conglomerate 1 and bank conglomerate 2 have separate systems (perhaps due to regulatory issues), but use a cryptographically secure swap to connect the two systems. This will create an "internet of blockchains" as it were. If Bitcoin maintains it's  immutability and  [sic] permissionlessness it will still be successful because people want their tokens to be as "general" as possible.

Even if you could enforce deterministic signatures (you can't because you need the private key to confirm that it follows rfc6979), you're neglecting the numerous other places where malleability exists within a transaction. I think what you really care about is "Strict DER encoding" when it comes to signature malleability anyway. To get an idea of how malleability *was* going to be fixed before Segwit softfork read this: 
Edit: I wonder if there's a way to supply a zero-knowledge proof that you used a deterministic signature. Pretty sure it would be purely academic, though.

Yeah. That's disappointing and seems to be some sort of attention seeking behavior. Not sure why he is bringing it up now. Around 2012 someone put Tor links to CP in the blockchain... so it's already been done. It's one of the better arguments that nodes must remain runnable on a average computer and internet connection. Also since pruning exists it seems like putting data into the UTXO set is the only really problematic way to cause these issues so long as there are nodes around (perhaps in other jurisdictions) that have the entire history.

Current technology is a double edged sword. I would classify bitcoin as an extension of modern cryptography. And modern cryptography is ducking huge advancement for human kind. It's the atom bomb in level of importance (Bitcoin and crypto). I highly recommend anyone who is interested to read the moral character of cryptography by rogaway (Google it) which reflects much of my views on the subject.

Peter R is trying to make the point that at time 0, if no block is found other than the hidden one, the rest of the network will expect to find a block in 15 minutes. It's the old coin flip or roulette probability question. If you flip a coin 5 times and it lands on heads, what is the chance that it will land on tails on the next flip?
The question is kinda ambiguously worded though, but i would side with Peter R based on the captioned illustration of the problem.

The idea of smart contracts existed before Bitcoin. I think it might have been Szabo (or similar cypherpunk) in the mid 90's that coined it. The thing that made it "smart" was that it was cryptographically enforced (protocol based), rather than relying on a traditional legal system.

sw2x - I like that it may get segwit deployed, I'm worried about the HF. I think it's a misguided attempt at consensus building and it's possibly going to lead to a split in the currency. More likely, I think we will not hardfork in a few months, but maybe a year or two. I think a simple change the blocksize hardfork is not worth it and would rather see a hardfork that aims to get as many wishlist items as possible out of the way, which means it should be far future years rather than months. I'll be very surprised if the sw2x HF goes off without a hitch and we all adopt it as the one-true-Bitcoin... for all the suits that are talking, there are some early hodlers that generally keep their mouth shut. Don't underestimate that.

If SPV users aren't going to be forced to upgrade then how will the clients be able to use an opt in method for replay protection? If the answer is they should upgrade anyway, then why are they being allowed to operate at all? Shouldn't you use a hardfork change to cause a "fail-fast" situation. It would be much safer, even if somewhat more disruptive, for SPV users especially in an 80/20 split where there is a significant nonzero chance that the lower hashrates chain could momentarily overtake the higher one.

* And: "server farms with one or two network nodes that feed the rest of the farm over a LAN.” ≈ "pool", even though Satoshi did not use that word. What does it matter if those ASICs are placed in the same room or not, of course he understood that others could connect to this LAN via its WAN-connection via the so called Internet, using VPN, Tor or whatever...
No. Pool infrastructure is *completely different*. It relies on a misunderstanding of what a pool actually does. (See socrates1024 - Miller's post).

You'd think that, but they are actually very related. Most of the ways to prove fair action by a central party are going to have to be related to the mental poker. You are removing some (not quite all) of the trust placed in the central party.
Edit: You might get away with making a few more assumptions about play arbitrated by a central player and be able to relax some of the shuffling algorithms, but you'll run into some of the same basic problems [e.g. clients have to be able to introduce their own entropy and have it proved to them that their entropy was used, without revealing hand histories or be able to "read" the deck by colluding.] I do think it's entirely possible for a central party to add it into their system, I just think implementation is non-obvious.

I think SWC probably got away with it a lot longer because they didn't know exactly how to apply the existing law to a Bitcoin accepting site.

It's really not about competency. There is no doubt that Garzik is a competent coder, but the problem is that Bitcoin development grew up past him (same thing happened to Andresen). When the Bitcoin Foundation came about, Gavin took a step back from active development in order to "research", the problem with this approach is that if you aren't down in the trenches keeping up with current development you will lose the knowledge necessary to practice as well as you used to. In my field, we see it all the time... a medical doctor starts running a professional organization or becomes part of administration and then when they "return" they, at least for a short time, become one of the more dangerous practitioners. They have the hubris of a fully trained physician, but the wheels aren't oiled any longer. The good among them recognize this and start off slow, work on their continuing medical education, and ask for help from their fellow providers (who may be much younger than them). That exchange of knowledge from new&lt;-&gt;old and vice-versa is extraordinarily beneficial. The bad among them assume they still know everything then drop a lung on a non-ultrasound guided internal jugular central line attempt - killing the patient.
Garzik has not contributed much to Bitcoin Core in the last 3 years (I won't take time to count commits), meanwhile thousands of other commits have taken place by numerous authors. He could be the Nikola Tesla of early bitcoin development; but just like I wouldn't put Nikola Tesla in charge of modern power substation design I wouldn't think that Garzik could be responsible for replacing Bitcoin Core. I don't think we should use legacy as a substitute for peer-review.
It's actually pretty wonderful watching this development take place. It mirrors early history of a lot of professions with all the successes and failings that happened early on in those fields.
Put it another way. I'm a board certified internal medicine physician. If you and I were trapped on a desert island with an OR, I could probably get your gallbladder out... the scars would be ugly and your recovery would be uglier, but I might (I'm about 60% confident) could get it done. I will never perform a cholecystectomy because I know it's outside of my comfort zone. Bitcoin development is starting to become specialized (it actually is quite specialized) and it's going to get increasingly that way. There's not going to be a person than can do it alone (even Satoshi had quite a bit of early help from Sirius, theymos, and Finney)... we have to work together to make this happen. I'd be happy to welcome Gavin, Satoshi, and Garzik back into current development... but they should not be afforded special permissions just because they were there first (yes even Satoshi!).

A default btc1 node that spins up without any changes to configuration would have never ever been able to progress the chain past that point NO MATTER the size of the mempool because by policy it could not produce a base size larger than 750k. The only way it have progressed it past that point would be to have manually configured a node to produce a block template larger than 1 mb. The fact that this isn't defaulted higher means on the mainnet a miner would effectively not be mining any longer AT that particular block (with respect to the btc1 chain) if they didn't make that change. Now that it's known it will be avoided, but it's still disconcerting.

If you can understand the substance of the message you would realize in 2011 he had a good understanding of bitcoin.

Heres another one... 
Notice who he is talking to. Ian Grigg (of R3CEV) calls Bitcoin a pyramid scheme. To which Adam says "Bitcoin does not have to end with the pyramid scheme outcome." This is 2011... he predicts multiple bubbles and a "wild ride"... all before the $30 bubble pops. Seems he has a pretty good grasp of what's to come. But whatever, I guess our definition of "ignored" is just too different. Not sure which definition you are using.

* 3 of 5 multisig, one in safety deposit, one at home and 3 in other trusted places (being vague) = 100x or more
Always keep in mind there is more than one way to lose coins: theft, loss due to user error, loss due to act of god. A lot of time guarding against theft makes loss more likely to occur. For example a 5 of 5 would be more secure but loss of one of the keys (fire, flood, etc.) Would lose the coins forever.

The data is a bit hard to collect because it would require traversing the network and knowing which nodes are connected to miners, but from my nodes POV they are a lot more well connected.

There's likely a minimal viable hashrate which would lead to self sustaining behavior almost like an activation energy you see in chemistry. Have to keep in mind the negative feedback and malicious behaviors that can exist at the lower hashrates. I suspect that somewhere around low double digits is where a UASF could meander along for some time before being successful. There's some fear I have that we are paving the way for a more viable attack vector by exploring these waters. Getting some of this game theory worked out likely makes future "evil softforks" more desirable to pursue for some actors.

There doesn't necessarily need to be any phase transitions in a Carnot cycle, but I think phase changes are allowed in the cycle and it can still be considered a Carnot cycle (it's been &gt; 10 years since I took thermodynamics and fluid mechanics so don't take my word on it). In the end, I was just being pedantic there. I would be interested if you tried to modify your ideas to fit onto a less-ideal cycle (think Otto) because then you can use that model to express what things can be modified to get closer to a "carnot ideal." I posit anything that disadvantages a miner for any reason other than their ability to produce work should be eliminated if practical. 
Edit: we obviously have geographic worries to think about and the nice thing about "energy islands" in the world is they provide a nice incentive to decentralize. I've been thinking lately about some way to make a system of oracles around the world that gives a slight advantage to the "antipodes" of the miner that last found a block in the network (not sure if there is anyway to make it trustless though). Other ideas such as smart property miners have been floated too (seems to fail in the "issuing" step, though). Interesting stuff to think about.

It actually happened once in an earlier version. Gavin found a flaw that would allow anyone to spend anyone else's bitcoins. Satoshi and him quietly fixed it.
If a huge flaw in bitcoin occurs, as long as it's not in ECDSA, I don't think it will necessarily end bitcoin, but it would cause a massive loss of value.

That's what I read into it as well. Satoshi also didn't really demonstrate anything other than respect for other cypherpunks such as Hal Finney or Zooko. This is one of the few threads where he showed a significant interest in someone else's idea (although it didn't pan out) - an idea that would have been a significant privacy benefit. The whole thread is worth a read though, including Red's last post.
Another note, the term "backtrace fan-out" is interesting since it's a digital circuits term. I don't know of it being used in any other field other than EE/ECE, but perhaps it's used in computer science. Really suggestive of Satoshi being quite the polymath.

This is the second or third crash I've been through, depending on what you count. I posted [this]( before the last two run ups... and I posted [this]( in I believe that Bitcoin as a technology is a wonderful thing.  But the price was outrunning the infrastructure... this will happen over and over until the tech is more mature.
That said, I would not advise my mother to buy bitcoin. I would advise a company to accept bitcoin through a third party such as Bitpay since the risk is low. I wouldn't advise my friends to buy Bitcoin either... unless I felt they understood what they were getting into. You have to know how to use it, spend it, and keep it safe. We just aren't there yet for users to adopt it.
Personally I'll keep using and spending Bitcoin, but until there are solid implementations of the advanced features of Bitcoin, hardware that is purpose built for storage/spending of bitcoins, and more widespread acceptance (even through third-party intermediates) we have to accept the majority of what is "priced" into Bitcoin is speculation about its future success. And speculation is a double-edged sword.

There's a lot of potential with AI/IoT/VR/AR technologies just around that corner. Very cool and wonderful things in our future if we can keep from falling into the trap of giving people power they shouldn't have. We won't get that power back easily. Bitcoin helps keep some of that future possible, but also protecting us from it. As long as we can keep it immutable and fungible it's going to help immensely. Not sure I can really explain it all well without writing a few pages.

It would be really nice to have a DWBs telemedicine setup that doctors from all over the world could donate their time to (or in exchange for a small amount of compensation). The problem is the regulatory environment in virtually all British/American medical systems would make this extremely difficult to have above board. It's the money transmitter problem all over again. In the US, I have a DEA license, a state equivalent of DEA license, board certification, state medical license, medicare/medicaid agreements, as well as hospital contracts... now it's possible to practice medicine with just one of these (state med. license), but if any of these are revoked my practice would be severely limited.
I'm somewhere in the libertarian spectrum, but I love practicing medicine more... and that means I have to play the game (for now). Now if a truly decentralized anonymized way of handling physician/patient interactions became possible (Tor hidden service that could verify crendentials, but not store those credentials) I would think about participating.

The person that owns the most is probably Satoshi (the inventor(s) of the currency), then probably the US Federal Government (after seizure from the Silk Road) - Edit: Now that I think about it I doubt they are  but they are up there. The exchanges are definitely up there, too.
The cool thing about Bitcoin, is that the transactions are all out in the open, certain types of analysis can be performed at a very low cost.

There are two algorithms which concern bitcoin, Grovers and Shors. I'm typing this on my phone so I will keep it short. These algorithms would run in polynomial time on a quantum computer. Shor's algorithm could find a private key from a public ecdsa key in polynomial time. You would have to have a quantum computer (a real one) though.
So Shors breaks ecdsa. But all is not lost. We have several other types of public key cryptography that appear as if the will be resistent to quantum computing. The other thing is that you have to know the public key to reverse it to the private key. A bitcoin address is actually a hash of the public key and not the public key itself. You reveal the public key when you spend from the address, but not before, and if you send your change to a fresh address you do have some level of protection.
Regardless, the chance that we have a practical quantum computer soon enough that this would be a problem is remote. I think we will have moved to a different signature algorithm before it truely becomes a worry. 
Grovers algorithm doesn't break sha256, the algo used in mining, but it does reduce the difficulty by a huge order of magnitude. I am not sure if that's really a problem, but if it is, the proof of work algorithm could be changed to something that is harder on quantum computers. 
The only way I can see a game ending break in bitcoin would be a proof that one way functions do not exist (meaning there are no functions that are hard to reverse). 
If you want to read more look into computational complexity theory and postquantum cryptographt.

A cryptography expert who uses a pseudonym that is similar to his own name is as stupid as a cryptography expert who uses a ROT13 cipher. It makes absolutely no sense. e-cash systems have been thought about a lot, there is a huge body of work on them. Satoshi came up a novel method to solve the double-spend problem, but it was heavily built on the ideas of others. Read through mail-archive, the white paper, and bitcointalk posts and decide if you think this is still a good candidate for Satoshi. Looking at his published body of work, there are some similarities, but I don't see any proof-of-work papers or anything similar.
It just doesn't set well for me. I can tell you if I were to come up with a pseudonym I would not pick a pseudonym that close to my real name. I would pick an entirely different nationality.

Depending on how savvy the person hiding on the other end, it's extraordinarily low. I would bet they used a stolen identity to register through the proxy in the first place, so even if you could get the proxy to report who the person was that registered their domain, it's unlikely that they are really the ones responsible. These scams have been around since before bitcoin, just some people are being educated more about them now.
@_date: 2013-05-12 05:25:10
You are right. Got to get you back to positive ;)
Shor's algorithm would likely break ECDSA (someone correct me if I'm wrong) and Grover's algorithm would half the mining difficulty (assuming quantum computers are just as fast as convential computers). Lucky none of these things matter yet and we can always move to other encryption algorithms if necessary.
This was the thing I had to look into before I "bought into" bitcoin. 
Edit: it would more than half the difficulty... dur.... 2^128 vs 2^256
Also it should be noted that even if ECDSA was broken, if you use change addresses and only spend from each address once, then your ECDSA public key is never revealed (only its hash) which would possibly make you a little more secure.

I agree with you that the attack vector is smaller by not using the product, and I never meant to imply that it wasn't. I also know the encryption of bluetooth is pretty broken, but if you wanted to add complexity to the system you could set up a software encrypted layer connection over it.


If you already have that then you can just use the phone to spoof your transaction the next time they use their Trezor.
Of course, I don't know the actual implementation of the security on the Trezor, but given that these are the same people that came up with a way to pool mining securely, I think they would be able to make a reasonably secure hardware device. I know they expect the device to be used in less-than-secure ways and in always on systems, they even advertise in their video that you could use it on a potentially malware ridden system. It is designed to be connected to a compromised device.
There will be a wireless hardware wallet, it's just a matter of time. I happen to think the risk is worth the convenience. I have about $10 dollars on android spinner most of the time, because it's convenient. I wouldn't put more than a couple hundred into spinner, but I might with a trezor securing it.

Just you and the merchant will know the "full story", but you can choose to show your "proof" to others and they will be able to verify it independently. Think of a payment channel like this.
* Transaction 1: Hits the blockchain - this opens the channel (open a tab).
* "Stuff" happens in between between you and the other party. This stuff is trading back and forth valid transactions that do not necessarily hit the block chain.
* Transaction 2: Hits the blockchain - this closes the channel (closes the tab).
Everyone knows transaction 1 and transaction 2 happened, just like regular bitcoin. It's your choice if you want to show the "stuff" that happens between. If you do show it, then anyone you show will be able to see that it's true (they'll see that you and the barkeep exchanged valid signatures throughout the whole set of transactions).
This is all about payment channels. This is not LN, but the ideas stay the same. The conceptual leap from payment channels to LN is really hard for some people to make.

It's really unfortunate that they maintain the most market depth. Luckily, I'm not a day trader, I'm more of a buy and hold or spend kind of guy, which means that I never keep USD on an exchange and send BTC to my cold storage or other wallets as soon as I "own" them.

I have just kinda watched the debates on this one, so I'm not an expert. But I think it's more of an addition to the protocol. All the old stuff will still work, but there will be some additional ways to interface with it. Since the Satoshi client is the reference client, other clients will be more likely to adopt it. It's backward compatible and people can make the choice whether they want to use it. The "backbone" of the network is mostly unchanged.

Let me get back to you on that. I've got to actually check my work on that one.
Edit: Ok I just threw some numbers together. It's actually completely incompatible to repurpose the hashrate of the bitcoin network to find collisions because the operation to check for a collision is a bit more complex than calculating SHA-256 hashes (See:  but let's just say for fun that the current "hash" operation can check (Generate private key -&gt; convert to public address -&gt; does public address have a balance? -&gt; Yes -&gt; Collision found). ~~That means the entire network can check 5,000,000 GH/s. If we assume that 1/194866884977453722427157977695504402620791 contains a balance (from my previous calculation) then repurposing the current hash rate would have a 8 x 10^-19 chance of finding a collision in 1 year. - I could be very wrong with this math.~~ Actually I think I have to use a birthday attack calculation to figure this out... I'm too tired right now to think about it straight.

If I spend a bitcoin that was last spent 10 days ago I "destroy" 10 bitcoin days... if I spend 2 bitcoins last spent 10 days ago I destroy 20 bitcoin days. If I spend 1 bitcoin that was last spent 2 years ago I destroy 730 bitcoin days.
So the idea is that it gives you knowledge of coins that haven't been used in a while that have just moved. Satoshi has blocks of coins that were mined and never spent... if he were to move 50 coins from the first block that would destroy 90,700 days... If he moved bitcoins from the first 100 blocks it would be ~9 Million bitcoin days destroyed, but would only be 5000 bitcoins.
So spikes happen when a user moves lots of old coins. Could be to anywhere though. There are other explanations below.

I think there will be competition eventually. It's actually pretty hard work doing what they've done, and almost by necessity the project is open source... so the competitors will have a lot less development overhead to deal with. Competitors will probably also want to emulate the Trezor and how it talks to various software wallets. There are huge applications coming, and a hardware wallet is going to be a big step. For example, it took the ESPN sign guy a couple of days to figure out offline transaction signing. Hardware wallets will streamline that into seconds.

You would have to have a secure process (using checksums, etc.) to get a bitcoin client installed onto the offline computer, then you would have to have the ability to get transactions for the client to sign onto the computer and back to your "online" computer to broadcast the transaction without ever transferring anything but transaction data from your "online" to "offline" computer.
We are going to eventually need dedicated pieces of hardware for this function that make it physically impossible to leak the private key. Trezor looks promising.

You'll have to build the armory client from source since RPi is ARM based, unless somebody has made a repo for it yet, and I wouldn't trust it anyway unless it was supplied by etotheipi himself (I did read a post saying he is working on it). I gave a binary build for armory to another redditor last Monday. I think etotheipi is going to make a build for the RPi so that step can be skipped. I think a deterministic wallet is essential to use for offline transactions in order to not make newbie mistakes (forgetting about change addresses, etc.)
**EDIT:** This seems to be a fairly complete method of getting the client built.

My advice to you is that you just wait for the problem to fix itself or contact blockchain.info about it, that way you don't risk a mistake.

Oh and btw, buy yourself some plex or something. Just promise me that before you load this onto your home computer or blockchain.info wallet that you will reinstall windows. It's the only way to be sure that you got rid of what has compromised you. Bitcoin mining malware is pretty sophisticated stuff.

This is actually very good advice. The daytraders are having their lunch taken away from them because they are not factoring in all of the risks associated with keeping bitcoins (and fiat) stored in an online exchange, many of which have no insurance or appropriate method of recompense. This is not a problem with Bitcoin itself, just the nascent ecosystem around bitcoin. You guys are dealing with CompuServes and Excites of Bitcoin, not the Googles - and even that is generous. I buy coins a lot from coinbase, but I never keep my coins there for more than a day and I *trust* them. They seem to have appropriate security practices set up (offline "cold" storage, 2FA, etc.).
Disclosure: I have never sold any Bitcoins, though I have given plenty away and bought plenty of electronics with them.

Which private key? The one that is secured in a safe with a BIP38 wallet that I generated with the roll of dice XOR'd against a PRNG from an offline computer or the one I used for spending that only has about $200 dollars worth of bitcoins at any one time?
Personally my identity is much more valuable. It's tied to my DEA number as well my state and federal licensure. In fact, if prescriptions were written used a public/private key system... millions of dollars of prescription fraud would disappear over night. Instead I write my clear text DEA number on a prescription and just wait for it to be stolen. Good thing I have prescriptions written on paper with watermarks... so secure... low drug fraud.

I had a bitcoin node set up to relay transactions it would receive from a packet radio transmitting TCP IP over AX25.  1200 bps would receive one transaction every few seconds. 
The idea I had was have a listening node that would relay any valid transaction that it received OTA. I made a proof of concept that was really hacked together, but it worked... kind of. (Edit: also used testnet since there's a question of legality if real Bitcoin was involved).
We need significantly more baudrate to be practical to actually relay blocks and large number of transactions, but the concept is the same. Also the sat stuff is really interesting because you can get dramatically higher data rates with equipment that's relatively cheap... but you'd have to have access to a satellite. Jgarzik used to have a project that was going to launch nodes on cubesats, but it quite literally never got off the ground.

I think that's an excellent way to put it. I've been drinking a little bit, so I'll keep this short so as not to make too much of a fool of myself, but I think bitcoin (or more generally the use of proof-of-work+blockchains) as a ~~different~~ independent solution to the coincidence of wants rather than as a one-to-one substitution for money. I disagree with some of the more prominent people in the community (such as evoorhees) because I don't see bitcoin as a near perfect money, I see it as a new primitive to build with. I don't think anyone really can understand all of its implications yet. That's probably why I'm less inclined to call altcoins crap... I see bitcoin as eventually winning out, but the variants are necessary and useful to spurn further innovation. 
Let me preface this by saying that I don't actually believe this, but it's cool to think about: In the far-out future, probably after I die, I can see that innovation being the root cause of a post-currency system... almost like Roddenberry's Star Trek. People don't have to think about money or assets... it just kinda happens.

The improvement will have to dramatic and offer little or no trade-off from the features of Bitcoin. Additional, the difference in implementation would have to be so different that the Bitcoin devs could not code the features into Bitcoin itself or not be able to spend the required political capital to get the features implemented (get the users/miners to hard fork the chain or dump obsolete hardware respectively).
My test for validity of an altcoin is if offers a feature that is different, but complementary to Bitcoin. Namecoin and PPCoin fit, but I'm not terribly interested in either. Litecoin meets the definition for me as well (uses a memory-hard algorithm for proof of work), but I don't think this feature is worthwhile (although many would disagree).

In the US the main "rulings" have come out from FinCEN:  - They mostly say you must have a money transmitter license to buy or sell bitcoin for fiat. From what I understand, you must register at FinCEN for a license as well as the state you operate in. You have to have several million dollars worth of surety bond to register in all states. My state, for example, requires the applicant to have a net worth of ~$250,000 and a surety bond of $50,000. That plus a $5000 for application and license. Multiply that by 50.
I watched the hearings recently and it was pretty clear the IRS is supposed to come out with some guidance on how to treat bitcoin. My guess is it will be treated the same way as any other investment... it being taxed as capital gains when you realize those gains (either by buying something or converting it back to USD).
It's going to be a while before a government is going to be especially friendly to bitcoin... but the freer states that don't have capital controls are going to be more friendly. Personally, I feel that as something like Bitcoin (or Bitcoin itself) becomes more accepted, governments will carry some in reserve just like they carry gold in reserve. When they have reserves of it, they will be less inclined to damage it by over-regulation.
It's also important to note that many types of regulation that are being levied on Bitcoin will be close to unenforceable, especially as the economy becomes more "closed loop."

There are problems, and some of those problems don't have obvious solutions. The POW algorithm is solving a problem of distributed consensus and there's going to be confirmation times before things are "set in stone." That is pretty fundamental to how Bitcoin works without having a central authority.
I think Trezor (and the hardware wallet concept) is good first step in solving  on your list, but it's still not quite there.
I also don't see Bitcoin as a drop in replacement to fiat... I see it developing in parallel and stealing govt. fiat's business where it functions better.

I think looking into the appearance and how Satoshi acted early on is reason enough for me to trust him.
Here's a good discussion on point  back when bitcointalk actually had satoshi around: 
The seizure of DPR's coins probably happened in much the same way other peoples coins are stolen (as we see from the myriad posts here and bitcointalk)... by leaking a private key or an unencrypted wallet in some way. Personally I have cold storage wallets, but they aren't password encrypted, so if you found where I had them stored, you could steal my bitcoins. My guess is he had either a weak password encryption on his wallet, or none at all.

I'm just going to run some numbers... this assumes no optimizations with the blockchain. It also just makes some very basic assumptions to get us into the ballpark of cost. So don't grill me too much on it. ;)
* For 10 MB blocks we could manage 70 tps
* For 100 MB blocks we could manage 700 tps
* For 1 GB blocks we could manage 7000 tps
* For 10 GB blocks we could manage 70,000 tps
The maximum linear growth rate for the in each of these situations is as follows: 525 GB per year, 5.25 TB per year, 52.5 TB per year, and 525 TB per year.
Lets run this out for 10 years.... so just multiply the numbers by 10.
How much does google charge for storing 5250 TB of data in today's economy... 
About $275k per month.
So the cost of fully functional node in 70,000 tps bitcoin world that had run for 10 years will be about $275k per month if that node existed today. Of course, it doesn't exist today... maybe 10 years in the future we will have a system like that. So how much would it cost then? IF we apply Kryder's law and run it out that far, it would cost about $29 per month to host a copy of the blockchain.

I use Bitcoin quite a bit, not as much as fiat, but a lot. I have never worried about the appreciation of bitcoin. I bought a Trezor when the market value of Bitcoin was ~120. I sent somebody 0.25 bitcoins 2 years ago (~$1) just to demonstrate the utility. I've bought every single humble bundle since they began to accept it. I've bought beer/wine from a liquor store. As soon as a Chevrolet dealership accepts Bitcoin, I'll put a down payment on a Corvette with Bitcoin.
It's easy to misapply many different economic theories to Bitcoin. 
* "It's a commodity, therefore Gresham's law applies."
* "It's a currency, therefore velocity of money applies."
These are wrong simply because Bitcoin does not fit neatly into a economic category that has been well studied. It's a dirty hybrid. Many people like to hand wave over the divisibility of Bitcoin as something that is without consequence, but I would posit there is no historical comparison whatsoever that can be applied adequately. People will call it a straight commodity, but that simply ignores it's properties that make it useful in situations that other instruments fail at or require a significant amount of work (fees) to achieve (e.g. remittances, smart contracts/property, rapidly adjusting micropayments, autonomous agents, "illicit" activities, secure multiparty computations etc.). 
To pidgeonhole bitcoin into an existing definition and then apply existing theories to it is an exercise doomed to futility. New hypotheses need to be formed and tested and then the theories can be modified to account for those different properties. One more analogy and I'll stop with the pedantry: economists are applying Newtonian physics to subatomic particles and are blaming the particles when they don't behave as expected.
I've seen this "we know" belief in my field a lot, and when a paper comes out that disputes one of those beliefs, it takes a long time for it to be accepted and to come into practice.

No, wallets are based on 256 bit ECDSA private keys. 
To get an idea how big this number is, according to wolfram alpha, there are 4 private keys per atom in the milky way galaxy. Of course you don't have to guess the exact private key to find a collision as public addresses are ONLY 160 bit, but it's still going to be such a ridiciously high number that it makes no sense to brute force a key when you can put all that computational work into mining coins.
@_date: 2013-06-11 04:01:28


You are right of course. The concept of coloring "all the coins" is kind of silly, but I wanted to start from that concept because it's easier to bridge to the idea about providing a "backing" to bitcoin.
And I agree with you that Bitcoin is extremely practical and there is no need to have it backed by anything. It stands on its own merits. However, I do think that guaranteeing bitcoin owners a physical commodity may help break through some psychological barriers that *some* people have in using bitcoin. Some people, and I am not saying they're right, want a return to a gold standard... it adds to their psyche that they can trust that piece of paper in their hand.


You might have to expand on this for me to go along with. I really think that calling this entity a "treasury" is a good idea. It's not really an exchange, as bitcoins would still be tradeable for other currencies on the open market, with the hope that the exchange rate would be significantly higher than the value of the physical assets that back it. What the treasury would do is guarantee that you would receive a ounce of gold or whatever arbitrary backing contained within the treasury *regardless* of the exchange rate of bitcoins. People wouldn't fear the bottom falling out completely because "at least" there is something I can get out of the coins.


I think the Bitcoin "treasury" would be located in whatever country would have the most favorable laws for it to exist in.


I figure it had been discussed before, but I didn't want to do a search for it on bitcointalk or here because I wanted to get my ideas about it down before I looked into what others thought.
Anyway, thanks for taking the time to read it. You certainly have given me some more things to think about. :)
Edit: My comment about the treasury being located elsewhere was a little flippant, there would definitely be some regulatory hurdles regardless of where the physical stored commodities were located. I just didn't want to bog the discussion down with those regulatory issues.

Sure I'll explain. Bitcoin is pseudonymous. 
That distributed, verifiable ledger does not have names like:
John Smith pays EvilDrugCorp, inc. 0.99 bitcoins
it has:
165DWgZcQeXkHMtvFeREws5i4tXm1zzDjn pays 1EWBvWU9ZeZxdgWmn8tZ8SGrGbQj5WycWv 0.99 bitcoins 
Do you know who either of the parties are? The answer is probably no, I certainly don't. But let's say "1E...." sends his coins to a known address, and not only does that announces to the world, "I am sending this exact amount to this address at this time from this address," then he has "outed" himself. So coins bought directly from an exchange and then sent to silkroad to pay for drugs is certainly not anonymous. All that would have to happen is a government agency ask Mt.Gox, "Hey, those coins that you sent to 1E... could you give me his name and address?"
Another way to announce your "ownership" of an address is sign a message with the bitcoin client. This tells people that you have access to the private key of that address and "own" it.
So bitcoin is not anonymous at all? No, that's just as wrong too. It takes an extra amount of work to become anonymous. Let's say you bought coins from someone locally without identifying yourself to them, then you have reasonable anonymity. Or use a trusted mixing service.
Simplified: Bitcoin is like cash this way. Bills can be marked, etc.
Sorry if this is more confusing than enlightening. If you have more questions, I will be happy to help.

I linked to a rather arbitrary spot in the discussion because it seems it was at the point that a few people started to grok the concept, Hal Finney being one of them. A lot of the criticisms raised are still being raised today, but I think it's a good idea to read through to get a better understanding of what Satoshi knew about the system from the get-go. It's also really interesting to see how condescending and aggressive some of the other posters are towards Satoshi's idea. I wonder how many great ideas were destroyed at the initial onset just because their creator lacked the fortitude to appropriately defend their work?

If you have that much invested, you need to educate yourself better. In your situation, I'd likely use a multisig address or Shamir's secret sharing scheme, but it's hard to recommend that to someone with little crypto knowledge. For ease of use, I'd suggest buying a couple trezors or something similar. Or just sell your Bitcoin for fiat until you feel safer.
I highly recommend not storing large amounts of BTC at any exchange.

I think we are on the same page now. Perhaps a treasury isn't the best term for the organization. It would be an organization that would have allocated commodities or fiat currencies available on demand similar to a gold certificate or bearer bond. The idea being that it would provide a guarantee of value for each unit of cryptocurrency regardless of exchange rate. I know the next question is "where would the commodities come from and why would anyone put in anything in the treasury?" I think the answer to this question is not obvious, but one could reason that an allocated guaranteed commodity would add more value because it would incentivise the use of bitcoins to persons previously uninterested in transacting with cryptocurrency. This would add more value to the collective whole of bitcoin than the loss of control of those commodities. 
I apologise I don't have much formal education in economics (limited to a single 1000 level econ course and a engineering specific course) so please forgive any misused words. 
The organization could be self policed or bound by law to perform this function. It would have to be set up in such a way that behaving badly (having fractional reserves) would be discouraged.

I believe we mean the same point. UNIX gave birth to or was highly related to BSD/Linux and a myriad other *NIXes. Bitcoin is a technology that wasn't here before 2009. Parts of it was around before then, but the way it came together is something unique. People will use that "base" to make incremental improvements until something revolutionary comes along to replace it. The Linux of the 90's is quite a different animal than the one we have now. The Bitcoin of the 20's will be the same way.

I really don't think that Moore's law can be applied to qubit complexity. Everything I've read about QC is that adding each extra bit to a QC gets exponentially harder. Something to do with entanglement. I think a more reasonable explanation of  the NSA wanting the snowden data is they already know what his keys are or they want access to the metadata associated with the encrypted data. 
I think setting up a contingency is a good idea when QC becomes a threat against ECC, but as I understand it the postquantum signature algorithms are not studied well enough yet and they require a significantly higher processor and storage burden. Let's not bloat the blockchain unnecessarily.

Yeah there is a lot wrong with higher education, but there is some good in it. I had some professors that challenged me. I could have learned all of the material myself, but I doubt I would have had the discipline to learn things that really didn't interest me. I think if you are going into a STEM field or using it as a bridge into a profession, then it's likely going to be worthwhile. This whole student loan business is absolutely out of control and I would not fault anyone for not wanting to be part of that racket.

It's true. Because the public address space is smaller than the private keyspace there **has** to be some private keys that could create the same public address, meaning that two owners would have the "key" to spend the contents of that address. It's so unlikely though there is no real reason to fret over it. The computational effort to generate a collision is ridiculously high, like many many more times than it takes to generate a block.

Hey thanks.
If anyone else is interested, I'll probably make a topic this week on how to do this. I gave ReactionDude a copy of my build, but in order to make it trustworthy I think it would be better if I just wrote a guide to building a cross-compiler and then Armory so it can be loaded onto a raspberry pi. With a little tinkering the build could probably work with other ARM based units like beagleboard, but I won't be able to test it. I was going to pull it from Armory client, but it looks like somebody has already started working on making the changes.

This reminds me of one of my favorite things Satoshi said (paraphrased from the bitcoin wiki)
"Yes, [we will not find a solution to political problems in cryptography,] but we can win a major battle in the arms race and gain a new territory of freedom for several years. Governments are good at cutting off the heads of a centrally controlled networks like Napster, but pure P2P networks like Gnutella and Tor seem to be holding their own." - Satoshi Nakamoto

Thanks for writing that. It's a practical solution to the problem. It also actually relies on the unproven existence of one-way functions. Essentially there is a huge prize to prove P=NP now (or rather one way functions fall in P, there would still be other candidates for NP complexity)

Physician with Mech E degree and a amateur Comp. Sci. background (started programming at age 12 in C and BASIC - now "know" C/C++, PHP, Java). 
Read about Bitcoin in 2010, but didn't really look into it until early last year. 
When I realized the problem it solved (practically - not completely), I bought in. People like to talk about "intrinsic" values of commodities and how bitcoin doesn't have any. They don't realize the value is in the protocol, what it secures and the power it has when people begin to accept it. Transactions which weren't even thought possible years ago will begin to happen.
In addition, I love watching Bitcoin develop. It seems to me that every "hard" problem that the Bitcoin developers have come across has had a solution proposed or already implemented. There is a checks and balances system in place (users/miners/devs) which I think is integral to the success of a open source project of this magnitude. All the ingredients of this "experiment" are there for it to be successful.
To me cryptocurrencies are an inevitability, but I'm not 100% sure the first truly successful one will be bitcoin, just 90% sure. ;)

Yeah, this isn't due to a keylogger. Your website leaks a private key for the treasure hunt of that address.

It's really good you are being careful, just don't let it paralyze you. Remember any transaction you create is not going to make you lose your coins until you sign that transaction and broadcast it. You can actually post your *unsigned* transaction for us to take a look at before you have it signed so we can verify it. So you have a bit more latitude to play around with than you think.

Yeah, I'll pull some articles... its been a while since I looked into it. A lot of the methods won't work because they require revealing the cards at the end of the hand, but if I remember correctly there are some that don't... they just take too many cycles to be practical.

I will say that almost every "attack" is unlikely to be a deathblow to Bitcoin, but could certainly shake trust.
**A break in the cryptographic algorithms.** The worst of which would be a simultaneous failure of ECDSA and RIPEMD160. If this were to occur, then the entirety of the blockchain would be invalidated. Everyone would have access to everyone else's coins and thus no one could prove ownership. This is exceedingly unlikely, but possible. It's important to note that if failure of this kind was seen we would have a lot of other security failures outside of the Bitcoin "universe" including in traditional financial sectors.
There are contigencies set up that would guide how the developers of bitcoin would proceed if something like that should happen, but it would almost certainly causes a massive loss of trust in the currency system itself.
**Cutting off a large amount of the Internet**. For example, China blocks all internet traffic (it has to be almost complete, otherwise the internal "nodes" would be able to propagate transactions and new blocks). This is very unlikely as well, but possible. This attack would slow down confirmations significantly and make the rest of the network more vulnerable to 51% attack.
**A sustained 51% attack.** If an adversary with a large amount of resources was able to obtain enough computing power to prevent transaction validations from occurring this could certainly damage bitcoin. At this point only powerful governments and a select few companies that own computer chip foundries could do this. And it would cost hundreds of millions of dollars. And the hardware that they created to do it would serve no other purpose. And it gets harder every single day to pull the attack off. And they would have to worry about another powerful adversary stepping in and preventing the attack.
**Over regulation.** Governments pass onerous regulation that make bitcoin noncompetitive. While possible, all it would take is one government to treat bitcoin favorably for it stay extremely valuable, and because of the efficiency of the bitcoin network a favorable regulatory environment will make that government succesful financially.
**Failure to scale.** The technology is not really that limited, but the infrastructure to support say 1000 transactions per second is significantly more costly than the 7 transactions per second that is currently supported.
It's actually fun to think of arguments against bitcoin... you start running up into really absurd situations for bitcoin to "fail." For example, to bruteforce private keys would take a supercomputer the size of a sun to even have a remote chance of being successful.

Though it seems like things are going favorably for both them and Bitpay, it would not surprise me if an overzealous state or federal attorney general decided to flex a little muscle and freeze accounts... if you're willing to accept that risk then by all means, use coinbase (with 2FA enabled).

Since my last post 26 minutes ago, I have developed a new entry into the ASIC mining market. The UltraMiner 5000. As you can see my first design has already been produced at the factory. This device is capable of 5000 GHashes/s. It uses specialized quantum tunneling technology and bipolar thermistors to create a sub-absolute zero thermal barrier. Because of this massive cool-down, it only uses a fraction of a watt of power. I accidentally produced 3 units that were sentient, but have since developed a emotion blocking IC which is guaranteed not to malfunction and create a computer bent on the destruction of the human race. I can ship these units in two weeks, but preorders are selling fast... I only have a couple thousand units left that I can produce in that time frame. Cost is 100 BTC.

I think our difference in opinion hangs on what we define as a novel consensus protocol. I'm aware of the existence of hashcash, b-money, and RPOW. I would say they are all novel protocols in much the same way Gopher and HTTP are related. They arrive at a consensus by different, but related, manners.
I have an argument about the coinbase reward halvings, but honestly I think Satoshi did that out of a little bit of coding laziness.  Bitcoin isn't perfect, but it doesn't have to be. It just has to be good enough.
One thing I would like to point out is a lot of the "better" systems ignore some basic human psychology and thus require others to influence the masses to participate. Most people act in their own self interest. That's what makes the prisoner's dilemma (and more broadly game theory) problem so intriguing. You can make an argument that a central point of control for the production of money is better, but that implies a certain meritocracy. I would argue you should design a system which gets people to act in their own self-interest in such a way that it's congruent with social interest.

This doesn't necessarily mean they are going to sell it on the market. I've moved old coins before (not nearly as many - I wish) when I had a different security level set up (went from a VM stored wallet to a BIP38 paper wallet, etc.). It could be as simple as that (move to SSSS), etc. Could be an off market sell... Selling that many coins would get you about 30 million USD and crash the market. Or you could sell off small amounts at a time so you wouldn't cause the market to slip as much.
Old coins are almost always in the hands of cryptoanarchists/cypherpunks. I highly doubt Satoshi or Hal Finney, etc. are going to torpedo their own project.
Also, just as a function of time the number of possible bitcoin days that can be destroyed increases linearly every year.
The only way to moderately sure of what the person is doing is for them to sign a message with the private key with their intentions and then you would still have to trust them.

In March, I believe, there was an unexpected hardfork because some miners were using 0.7 and others were using 0.8, the 0.8 miners created a block that was seen as valid to them, but not valid to 0.7 which caused 0.7 to build on there own chain (this was caused by a unknown error in a database library). The solution was to downgrade everyone to 0.7 so that that chain would catch up and become the longest chain again.

What I would do is source the components and see what the unit cost per Trezor is. The microcontroller (stm32f205rct6) unit cost is about $5 from what I see. The other costly item is probably the OLED display - from what I can see $10-20 per unit. The LCD or some other output device is needed to benefit from the security (you need to know what transaction you are signing).
The other parts (PCBs, SMD resistors, etc.) are probably somewhere in the $10-20 range. So that puts the unit cost at 45$... Then you have the case which adds a little more. I would say that we will see a $50 Trezor like device in a year or less and a $15 trezor-like device shortly (1-2 yrs) thereafter.
So will the price go down... yes, but it has to have a display of some sort to actually provide the fool-proof security that is needed and that is likely the bottleneck.

No. It has nothing to do when they were minted, just when they were last spent. By older I meant not as recently spent. And your transactions really won't be any faster in most cases. If you spend a newly spent coin without a fee it has less likelihood of being included in the next block compared to a less recently spent coin with a zero fee transaction.

Wolfram alpha is wonderful for this kind of stuff.
If you took the entire volume of the milky way and filled it with volumes the size of earth... it would take 4 x 10^41 earths. If each one of those earths represented a public address in bitcoin, you would need 3 million galaxies to hold all the "public address" earths.

Oh, excellent. On the online computer open up Armory and go to preferences. Uncheck the "Let armory run bitcoind in the background"... now close out and open bitcoin-qt and then open armory... it should be in online mode. It uses the same copy of the blockchain as bitcoin-qt does so it doesn't have to redownload the blockchain, just verify it... should take about 5 minutes at the most if you are in the new version of Armory.

Yeah, this gets really technical. I'll point you towards this:  - you can take it offline while you play with it before you broadcast the transaction. You'll have to extract the private keys for the public addresses from your wallet to get this to work as well and I'm not sure how to do that since I don't use blockchain.info's wallet services much. I don't want to be responsible in losing your coins, so if you go about this route I would try with a small test transaction first.

That's pretty much it. In order for another "virtual currency" to overtake bitcoin at this stage of the game... it would have to overcome a significant network effect. The only way I could ever see this happening is if that other currency offered a substantial benefit that could not be implemented into Bitcoin (it's a living protocol, just very conservatively managed - and for good reason) before the other currency overtook Bitcoin in usage.

Yeah, that would be impossible to implement though. It doesn't matter if you "spec'd" the port for miners to use. Anyone can write their own miner  botnet and use whatever communication they want to control it, just as long as the miners know what to work on and how to send the work back. Bitcoin's protocols are designed this way for a reason. If an organization wanted to stop bitcoin mining they would have a very difficult time doing it.

I agree with most of what you say. However, I think (4) is suspect. There are quite a few prominent CS/Physics people that don't think that a reasonably high q-bit QC is technically feasible, including Leonid Levin (of Cook-Levin fame). It might be possible, but to say "that is not even speculation" is a bit silly. The technical hurdles to get a QC capable of using Shor's algorithm are really high. It might be decades, but it could be much longer. I'm still waiting on my flying car after all. From what I understand, D-Waves' QC is not capable of running Shor's in polynomial time.
Another point I think is important, asymmetric crypto relies on the supposition that one-way functions exists, which hasn't ever been proven. If it is proven at some time in the future then we will know that there exists functions that are "uncrackable" if implemented correctly. The types of cryptographic attacks that are created on modern crypto often don't change the time complexity class of the algorithm, which is a pretty important point as well. That means we simply use larger key-sizes (and that's why brute-forcing Triple DES is still pretty impractical, even with all the "flaws" we know about with DES).
@_date: 2013-05-26 00:09:28
I can only speak in a generality because what I posted had some identifying info in it. Your public addresses are only as secure as your private keys. He revealed his private key for that address and then reused the public address, probably just absentmindedly. There's really nothing wrong with reusing public addresses, it's really just not best practice because it lowers anonymity in the whole system and storing all your coins in a single address is asking for problems unless you really take extra precautions.

Think of it like a unit of potential energy... like foot-pounds or a newton-meter (joule). If you lift a 1 lb object up by 2 feet then that 1 lb object has 2 foot-lbs of potential energy stored. When you drop the object it releases that potential energy. Same thing with Bitcoin-days - you are releasing (err.. destroying) bitcoin days... It's actually used to prioritize transactions that are otherwise equal in transaction fees (older coins spent get a higher priority).
I wouldn't call it a good thing or bad thing... just a thing. The connotation of the word "destroyed" is apparently what causes all the confusion.

Last comment and I'll leave you alone, I promise. ;)
I agree with you, bitcoin is not something you should put your money into without really understanding it. It's really a fledgling economy in its self and because of its newness, and because of differences in philosophies, it doesn't interface quite well enough in the "outside" economy. That being said, there are plenty of people that are wanting to buy bitcoins with real cash, as evidenced by the latest exchange rates (many people feel $40/btc is a bubble, others disagree). There are safe ways to get your money out of BTC if needed, if you need any guidance feel free to ask. The fastest way (and likely least secure) would be to exchange it with an individual. Another way would be to sign up for an account at coinbase.com, link a bank account and have them deposit directly. mtgox is another place that will exchange bitcoins.
A more complete list here:

You could use embedded invoices with qr codes in iframes.
 
This could be implemented like so. Please send x bitcoins for x amount of time. As the time begins to run out put up another code to scan for more time, etc. You would have to time it appropriately so that you would get a confirmation so that double spending would be infeasible. Other way would be just to credit minutes ahead of time. I don't visit cam sites but from my standpoint there are several ways that it could be implemented. 
Edit: please forgive my grammar, on my mobile.

Correct. Trezor will be step towards securing bitcoin so that the common user can use it. It signs transactions without ever revealing the private key (except on-screen the first time you boot the device). *If* the security on the side of the connection to the computer is excellent and their RNG is suitable, then there should be no way to steal the bitcoins without stealing the back-up or the trezor itself. And they even have ways to mitigate the damage if the trezor is stolen (with 2FA, etc.). Looking forward to getting my hands on one.

Agreed. The only people that I have talked to about bitcoin are intelligent enough to understand what bitcoin solves: the double-spend problem without trusting a central party. Once we have the thinkers, developers, and not-so-scared (because they understand it) investors working on cryptocurrency then and only then should start involving more people. I think we are just now getting to that point.
Don't get me wrong, I'm not wanting to make a technocracy or anything. There are plenty of people here who have no idea of how bitcoin works, they just know that it does work. That's fine, but I'd rather they get here by watching us talk about the technical merits or googling something like "How do I lower my chargeback rates?" or "what's the easiest way to send money to my family in Mexico?"

Pretty close. Coinbase only works with US accounts, so ignore this if you aren't in the US. I'll make it step by step for you.
* Sign up for a coinbase account and login.
* Link your account to your bank account. This is done by the linked accounts tab on the sidebar.
* Send your newly acquired bitcoins to the coinbase address. Thats that long address below "Bitcoin Addresses used to receive bitcoin from external sites" on linked accounts. To send your bitcoins from your wallet (I am assuming you are using blockchain.info, but there are many other wallets, online and offline) click send money and copy, paste that address from coinbase in the To: section and type the bitcoin amount you want to send. That will fund you coinbase account and from there it will be pretty easy to figure out how to get your money into a bank account. Your coins will take a little while to be "confirmed" before they show up in the coinbase account. So don't freak out when that occurs.
* Click Sell Bitcoins in your coinbase account, and from there I think you can figure it out.
Let me know if you get hung up. Not sure how long it takes to link a bank account, I use MtGox, but coinbase seems a little more user friendly.
Edit: I would also recommend you keep at least a little bit of the free bitcoins you received, just to have some skin in the game. The market cap of BTC is about $400,000,000 right now. Many of us believe that it will grow significantly. If that occurs, BTC could be worth several hundred dollars in the future. Of course, something could go horribly wrong, the market could crash and it could be worth nothing as well.
@_date: 2013-12-09 17:37:09
This is a good illustration of the pseudonymous nature of bitcoin, too. We know he own's this address. We can see the pizza purchase he talked about earlier and we can see his initial bitcoin purchase as well... he'd be advised to move his coins around into several different addresses. He needs an experienced bitcoiner to give him a crash course.
It's not a security issue, but it is a privacy issue.

Wow. Thanks so much! There is a pretty good synopsis on this stuff on the bitcoin wiki: 
If you continue to use bitcoin-qt, backup wallet.dat every 100 (maybe 75 to give yourself some buffer) transactions and you will be OK, or you could generate a wallet with 1000's of keys in the keypool (see link).

You may not have lost your money. Look at the taint analysis. Your username has sent multiple time to that same address. Figure out what that is then go from there. Good luck.

I am not talking about bruce-force attacks. I am talking about attacks that exists because of a currently unknown (or known but thought to be infeasable - such as Quantum computer/Shor's algorithm) vulnerability to public-key cryptography schemes. Just because we think a encryption algorithm is secure to all but a brute force attack, doesn't make it true. We don't brute force a substitution cypher, we use known attacks that exists that defeat it much faster. According to wiki, DES has at least 3 known attacks that are faster than brute forcing.
I should say that I believe that bitcoin is completely secure for the forseeable future, I am just speaking in hypotheticals.

I don't think it's actually different for any other properly functioning hash function. It's a simple math operation actually.
(2^256) / (2^160) = 79228162514264337593543950336
If the numerator was infinite then the answer would be infinite as well. But since the bitcoin private address keyspace is not infinite, there is only a finite number of possible colliding private/RIPEMD160(public key) key pairs.
Note: Not a cryptographer, so the terminology I used is probably horribly inaccurate.

I should mention that hardware wallets are going to be one aspect to the solution. I think as time goes on the best practice is going to be to have at least 2 wallets, probably more. One wallet will be a savings wallet which will be completely generated offline and kept offline. It would then be placed in a safe deposit box or a physically secure location and insured. The next wallet will be a "checking" wallet which will be carried as a hardware wallet. This wallet will pair with a phone or whatever device you use to control the client side and be near totally secure except to physical theft (armed robbery, etc.).

And even if ECC failed dramatically, only addresses that have spent from would be exposed because bitcoin addresses are RIPEMD-160 hashes of the ECC public key, not the key itself. The public key isn't revealed until it needs to be, when it's first spent from. That's why it's best practice to use different addresses and change addresses, that and it makes it just a bit harder to trace transactions.

I love logic puzzles.
Alice could require Bob to put up an escrowed amount of bitcoins equivalent to the amount contained within the locked wallet. Now this secures Alice against loss of her bitcoins. The dispute mediator could return the bitcoins to Bob if he delivers on said promise, or send them to Alice if Bob steals her coins.
The problem with this is now Bob has 100% bitcoins up for loss and Alice hasn't lost the password, and transfers them out before Bob completes the decryption, then claims that Bob stole the coins and the dispute mediator rules in her favor and now Bob is out of the bitcoins.
So my next suggestion: Beforehand they must agree to each put up coins equivalent to the amount of coins in the locked wallet in a collateral address which is held in escrow. They each agree that the next transfer out of the locked wallet has to go to address A, otherwise they both lose the coins in the collateral address. Address A is a contracted to only transfer coins to Alice if she pays the finder fee to Bob. If Bob steals her coins by sending them to his own address, he loses his collateral coins and the same for Alice if she steals her coins out of the address (mutually assured destruction). The worst case scenario would be for Bob to transfer the coins to a different address after he has unlocked it, but he would only do this if he was EVIL because there would be no net advantage, but in this case Alice would lose her collateral coins and the locked coins. A similar circumstance would occur if Alice transferred out (she would get no net benefit).

Since the code by necessity would be open source, if I came out with any kind of "administrative fee" or otherwise, someone would just clone the bot without the administrative fee... I suppose I would just ask for donations if anyone cared to give them (just like any other open source project). The way I see the payout structered is this:
* Escrow party = set fee
* Winner = 80% 
* Charity = 20% 
or something along those lines. Although that would all be up for discussion.
I actually started to lay out some code last night. I dunno know when I'll get bored or frustrated with it, but a lot of the structure of the bot is very similar to the tipbot, so I think it's coming along. If I get tired of it, I'll throw it on github to see if anyone else wants to take it up.

As I understand, and I am writing well outside my comfort zone, scrypt is designed to be memory-limited rather than processor-limited (please forgive my terminology on this). I hope I'm not building a strawman, but I get that the idea of using scrypt is to make it less economical to make specialized hardware and thus help prevent the consolidation of mining hardware to fewer parties; however, I really don't see the development of ASICs as a current threat to the health of the bitcoin network. Now if you can get an EE in here that swears to me that there are no further optimizations in existing hardware to speed scrypt hashing along then I would be surprised. It's probably just not economical to due so at this point, but perhaps when (and if) litecoins are valued at $100/LTC then it may become economical to build such hardware. Perhaps some distributed memory architecture, I don't know... you are welcome to try and convince me.

The transaction will be broadcast to the network anyway. It's ok for a man in the middle to listen to the transaction message and the signed message back because that information will already be transmitted on the network. Just as long as the transaction can be verified by the secure hardware as valid before it is signed and returned to whatever device broadcasts the transaction. So, a third party developer could add a battery and a small bluetooth transmitter and USB UART and attach it to a trezor and then you would have a wireless wallet.

I wouldn't lose too much sleep over what I just said. We can change fundamental portions of the protocol if it is felt it is needed. An "easy" way to continue would be to fork the chain at the point of catastrophic failure and have a failback POW or POS algorithm.
In fact, I can see a future where miners are in a cold war/cartel with each other. They only have a significant portion of their hashpower turned on and are in a [MAD]( situation with the other players around the world. If one drops out, they can easily sop of the hashpower. If a miner ramps up, they all ramp up together. Mining will go through stages of decentralization and recentralization I believe... I think this may be the problem that eventually leads to a hardfork. It's one of the reasons I say we are in for a rocky ride.
NONE of that changes the fundamental solution that bitcoin solves, and that is a problem of distributed consensus. That consensus doesn't have to be arrived at by calculating SHA hashes as the proof-of-work, it can use a different POW algorithm. I think what we are going to eventually see a hybrid POS/POW/checkpointing/oracle system with very clear contigency plans built in. That's far future though. And right now Bitcoin works fine. My guess is that the dominant system will still use the original ledgerbook (blockchain) from the Bitcoin system. My other guess is that system will still be called Bitcoin.

There are certainly more costs to bringing a finished product to the market, but a lot of the initial R&amp;D has been absorbed by the Trezor. Copycats will be able to make varying levels of compromise to reduce the price further. They will only have to focus on emulation rather than innovation.

Unless you are actively trading currency do not keep BTC in Mt.Gox. Send it to your wallet as soon as you can. Paper wallets or offline-only computers are the best, but even blockchain.info offers marginally better security than Mt.Gox. And always use two-factor authentication. It's the equivalent of putting a seat belt on.
No one should buy *significant* amounts of bitcoins (and that definition varies depending on the person) without understanding cryptography.

Sounds like you are doing everything right. I'm not sure how electrum handles change on imported addresses but for other addresses it uses a deterministic structure based on a 12 word seed. If you have copied it down you are probably safe. To test it I would import a second address and offline sign from that first. My guess is it will do one of two things. Dump the change back into the same public address or dump the change into one of the deterministically generated public addresses in the wallet. Either would be safe as long as you "own" your vanity addresses private key and you know electrums 12 word seed. If you need help let me know and I'll pm you a screencast or something.

Agreed there is always risk. I think the risk that bitpay is assuming is quite low, however. In fact, they lowered their processing fees recently which I don't think a struggling company with any rationality would do. If they have a fast track to exchanging the coins for dollars then I would think their risk is reasonable enough to run a business on. Even if bitcoins instantly crashed to zero, they will only lose the money that is equal to their outstanding payments. 
Its also really a quite low risk for a business to accept bitcoins using bitpay. They payout every business day, so the most a business would be out is a days worth of income if bitpay ever went belly up without paying their debts.
Assuming a bitcoin to usd exchange rate which has some liquidity and  is non-zero, I think you could prove that a company such as bitpay could exist and make a profit. They are a risk absorber, but so are insurance companies, and we know how profitable those companies are. I'm sure they did some back-of-a-napkin actuarial calculations and found that they could make some money (I certainly hope so).

There is a natural checks and balances system built into bitcoin (and most open source projects) amongst the users, devs, and miners. The devs could make any change they want, but that doesn't mean the miners and the users are going to go along with it. Almost all changes that make a fundamental change are debated on either github or bitcointalk.org. The thing is that almost everyone participating has a vested interest in Bitcoin succeeding. So, for the most part selfish changes (e.g. lets give Bitcoin foundation central control or lets "print" more than 21 million coins) will never happen without at least a sizable group consensus.
It should be noted there are a bunch of *NIX variants out there... see   These all came about because of different design philosophies and differences in openness, etc. Bitcoin has these pressures on it as well, but there is also a force of "lets keep this together so we don't F-up the exchange rate."
@_date: 2013-12-19 21:36:56
The problem is that in order for Bitcoin to be used in what you term as the "real economy" is that it has to be adopted by every person in the supply chain in order for that to happen. The farmer has to buy fertilizer and pesticides from Dupont/Bayer then he has to plant his seeds and plow his fields with a tractor bought from John Deere. Only then can he sell his crop for Bitcoin. John Deere has to buy metal from Worthington Steel. Worthington Steel has to pay its employees. At some point in the supply chain Bitcoin will be exchanged back into fiat.
In order for your real economy to actually happen, third parties have to step in to allow adoption to happen at any level in that supply chain. Then when the business they deal with start to accept bitcoin, they can start keeping some BTC to pay that supplier. Without bitpay, coinbase, BIPS, etc. the economy wouldn't be nearly as large as it is now and it wouldn't be nearly as valuable.
To put it another way, if a US manufacturer wires money to China to buy some parts and that Chinese company exchanges that for CNY, does that mean USD isn't part of the real economy?

Unfortunately, that isn't compatible with how proof-of-work works. There might be an innovative way in the future, but it's not going to be easy to setup. I used to think proof-of-stake was a reasonable alternative, but I'm not convinced of that now. I read an article by gmaxwell that seemed to put a lot of holes in its use.
It should be noted that in the case of overcentralization of the mining power, a ragtag group could switch the POW algorithm to disadvantage the hardware that's being used by the attacker, which would almost certainly be ASIC hardware since pretty much all supercomputers combined can't overcome the network hashrate. A switch to a new POW algorithm aligned to general purpose computer would allow redecentralization and the cycle would begin anew. That would fork the chain and cause a massive loss of value, but it's possible. There would be fights about who is the "true bitcoin" etc.
I personally believe we are going to have fights and massive losses of value while we have these fights. Altcoins seem to have let off some of the pressure though and perhaps game theory will prevent that from happening. Really it's anyone's guess.
Fun times ahead.
Edit: I should note that a decentralized method of a mining pool exists in the form of p2pool... that might help for a time as well. I personally don't think pools are the problem, it's individuals or groups of individuals that have massive resources that have the ability to act as a single player... chip foundry owners and governments.

For me there really isn't that much difference, other than there is a certain familiarity with Kickstarter... just from a salesperson perspective, people like to use something they are comfortable with and preordering from a site that I have never used before requires me to "trust" one extra step that I haven't used before. The other thing is that putting a successfully funded bitcoin project on kickstarter adds a lot of visibility. I think your product is the first-step of making a "grandma friendly" Bitcoin. It's good publicity as a whole. You've limited your sells to people that already frequent bitcointalk.org and - kickstarter reaches other people that might just have a passing interest in bitcoin.

It would have to employ a trusted centralized party (although there might be a way to use an untrusted party), but the solution to migrate bitcoins from an **unspent** public address (for which the public key is only known by the owner of the bitcoins) would be to send the public key of that address to the party who would then migrate it to another signature scheme (like lamport signatures or the like) and send the private key back to the owner. Then the owner could sign the transaction with the new signature scheme to address only they know the public/private keypair. Then we could go back to a decentralized method using the new signature scheme.
That's not to say that failure of ECDSA wouldn't be a complete disaster, but it would not end the idea of cryptocurrency in general, and probably wouldn't even end bitcoin specifically.
Absolute failure of bitcoin would only occur if RIPEMD-160 and ECDSA both failed near simultaneously and the only way I can see that happening is a generalized proof that one-way functions do not exist (which would strongly imply P=NP). If that occurred, bitcoin would be the least of our worries.
Hopefully we get smart before then and only transact once from each public address (as Satoshi intended).

As long as you use the same wallet app it will be really easy to import it into a new phone. I'm not terribly familiar with that app, so my guess is that as long as you backup every time you make a new receive address, then you will have a complete backup. The private keys can be imported into most other clients. I would recommend electrum as a desktop client for a beginner. When you start getting more into it, you could make the switch to bitcoin-qt (official client) or even bitcoin-qt + armory (my personal favorite and most feature rich, but least user friendly).

I'd say your getting that pretty well, if I am understanding your point. We actually have a pretty good infrastructure for decreasing volatility risks *to merchants* - not to bitcoin users. Both Bitpay and Coinbase offer solutions to merchants that take a spot price on Bitcoin and convert that to fiat on the spot as well as ACH that to your bank account every 24 hours. They assume the risk of the volatility. They charge 0-1% fees to perform this task (compare to CC fees of 3%). There's no reason a large company couldn't roll their own solution or outsource that to the likes of Bitpay or Coinbase.
See: 
The way, as a user of bitcoin, insulate myself from upward volatility is by purchasing equal amount of bitcoin that I just spent at a retailer. Of course, that doesn't work when the price of bitcoin goes down. :)

I agree with your points. I worry for bitcoin. One of the things that I am afraid will happen is stagnation of development. The point at which I will be truly convinced that bitcoin is here to stay is when a competing cryptocurrency comes out with better features like the ones you mention. Not something superficial, like litecoin, but a fundamental difference that makes it significantly better. If the developers/miners/community are able to come out with a version of bitcoin that incorporates the new features of its competitor before it becomes successful, fork the chain, coordinate the transition to the new client and mining software and do this all before the network effect of the competing chain overtakes bitcoin, I will be all in. If not I'll be trading my BTC for BTC2.0.

@_date: 2013-05-25 16:16:46
This stuff is pretty technical but if you have 50 bitcoins, it's worth figuring out.
It really depends on how each wallet client treats change addresses. I *think* blockchain.info uses one of the input addresses as a change address, meaning that your "change" from the transaction is sent back to your public address. Bitcoin-qt works differently. It has a generated keypool of private/public key pairs. Each time you send a transaction, the rest of the coins are sent to the next available unused public address which corresponds to a different private/public keypair. This theoretically adds a bit of security: if a thief steals your encrypted wallet and spends days bruteforcing it before cracking it, and in the meanwhile you are spending coins, if you exhaust the keypool then the client randomly generates key pairs for a new keypool, then your coins will be unstolen, even if you continue to use the same wallet. It also adds a bit of anonymity.
There comes with a huge problem though:
If you think that a one-time backup of wallet.dat saves your coins, you are mistaken. As you spend coins and transact with bitcoin-qt you will lose your backup as you exhaust your keypool.
The other reason bitcoin-qt uses this change address method is because if you spend only once from a public address you never reveal your public key corresponding to that public address. If a theoretical attack against ECDSA came to be your coins would still be protected by a hash, allowing the developers to use a different PKI, fork the chain, and thus save Bitcoin. The treat of this is currently miniscule, but in the future this might be possible.
**The solution to all of this:**
Use a deterministic wallet client that uses a pseudorandom generator and a private seed so that all future keypairs are known just by knowing that private seed. This gives the benefit of both using change addresses that are different but also allows a backup to never go bad. It also adds a bit of health to the system. Coins are just harder to lose when you use a deterministic wallet. The only disadvantage is that your coin won't get "unstolen" if someone steals your backup, you would have to transfer all your coins to a separate wallet before the attacker spent them.
My favorite client to use for deterministic wallets is Armory. Trezor will use a deterministic wallet as well. Armory has the advantage of running on top of bitcoin-qt, so you still act as a node and have a full copy of the blockchain. It's currently in some growing pains due to some memory management issues, but the creator is working on those.

If you think of bitcoin as just another currency, I can see why. But it is most definitely not just another currency. It's an amalgam that has never existed before. We often simplify it as "magic internet money" for beginners, because it really is the simplest use case to get your head around.
If I were an economist that also understood the mechanics of how bitcoin works (an economist that knows enough about Comp Sci/Crypto) I would be excited to see the development of bitcoin. It has a lot more controlled variables, which makes more concrete testable hypotheses possible. It is better and easier to quantify data. Even if they don't agree with the economics of it, they should see it as an area ripe for research. Compare this:

Which do you think is going to be easier to glean consumer behavior from?
Also the deflationary aspect is something that is not intrinsic to cryptocurrencies. You can make a permanently inflating cryptocoin, but good luck getting people to put their power behind it. You could even make a coin that varies its payout based on any external variable.

Dwave is calling their machine a quantum computer when they really shouldn't. While it's likely an advance, it cannot run Shors algorithm. It also uses different underlying physical principles which as far as we know can't be modified to perform Shors. It's like making a Stirling engine and calling it a cold fusion engine. They've created a novel device but it simply isn't what their PR team is calling it.
I do agree we should have contingencies ready to patched in, but I think the primary devs are prioritizing correctly with the issues of usability and infrastructure. I would love to see an altcoin with postquantum signatures implemented, though.

The blockchain size is limited by the linear function of time, not exponential. That limit is determined by the maximum block size. There's opposing market forces to determine what the max size of the block is, but many of the devs want to increase that block size. Even if that change takes place, the growth of the chain will still be linear, just with a new bound. At the current block limit the max growth of the blockchain is ~55GB a year, at a 10MB limit it would be ~550GB/year. That's without any form of "compression" or "pruning."
We need more full node implementations bitcoin clients, the Armory client is slowly moving in that direction and that dev is one of the proponents of "compressing" the blockchain.
Additionally, Moore's law has more to do with processor speed than storage. Kryder's law has more to do with storage and has been more accurate prediction (Doubling every 13 months).
Some devs are working on this, others are arguing if it's even important. Personally, I think it is important. However, I think we have a while to get the solution in place.

I can explain this one. When you use your Trezor first a mnemonic code is generated. If you are familiar with electrum, then you will know how that part works. You can write that down and store it in a secure location.
Then if you lose your Trezor, you can recover from that mnemonic code.
"Well if somebody steals my Trezor, they'll just empty out my wallet before I have the chance to restore anyway."
Not so. I don't remember the exact details, but they've developed an optional way to pair your Trezor to whatever software wallet you are using (like how you have to pair a bluetooth device). That way the attacker would have to physically steal your Trezor as well as your code that you used to pair to the wallet.

As long as there are multiple foundries that are making ASICs, I think we are ok. It is a dangerous time, but I think after the initial production costs and optimizations that occur we should be better protected against a 51% attack.
It will be interesting to see what develops. I can imagine a scenario when the miners will be in a "cold war" with each other. Each would have agreements to maintain a small amount of their available hashing power with the ability to ramp up as needed to thwart an attack. No one would ramp up because they would know that every one else would ramp up as well, resulting in higher electricity costs and lower profits. Additionally, any attacker would have incomplete information regarding how much hashing power they would need to really 51% attack the system. For that to work the difficulty algorithm would have to be changed more dynamically.
Edit: Post is purely hypothetical and It's just an interesting scenario. I'm not proposing any changes currently, just things to think about.

I think it's time to introduce you to some more of the exotic (and future) things that Bitcoin can be used for.
This video is 30 minutes long, if you can watch it that would be best, but I understand your time is valuable. This is a talk given in 2012 by Mike Hearn, Google employee and Bitcoin developer:
Here's an article... but it's quite technical:
I'll summarize some of the points though. Bitcoin blockchain (ledger) can be used for many more things than just irreversible transactions. Because of the math/cryptography many different kinds of transactions can be made. Anyone can designate a third party as *escrow* party. That party could reverse a promised transaction if the seller commits fraud, much like paypal. Unlike paypal, they absolutely cannot steal the money involved. Pretty cool, huh?
Another example is that bitcoin has a built in Kickstarter mechanism called an *assurance contract*. Someone can create a public address and state simply "If this address is 100 BTC, I'll build a park at this street" People can contribute to the 100 BTC total, but if the address doesn't get to that mark by a predetermined time, the bitcoins get returned to the contributors.
Another thing is title and ownership transactions. Namecoin is kind of spin-off to help with the concept, but Bitcoin can function to do the same thing. A car could have smart chip in it that only responds to the signature of the owner. If the owner wants to sell the car, he could make a transaction to transfer ownership to another person and the car's computer chip would also recognize that change in ownership.
And the coup de grace... Autonomous agents. Here's another 30 minute video.
And another technical article:
A little less technical article, but still good (written by another bitcoin dev On the Bitcoin network, no one knows you are a refrigerator, car, or toaster. And therefore, a computer has almost no overhead to create bitcoin wallet for itself and begin transacting with the network. If a program is "smart enough" to interact with other services, it could buy it's own server space and sell it's own digital services (say file storage, or a music store etc.). All this can be done without traditional owner to pay profits to, the program keeps its own profits.
@_date: 2013-07-22 03:13:56
Really for cold storage it's probably best to use a deterministic wallet structure like what is used by Electrum or Armory (and later to more standardized with [BIP 32]( These allow the storage of a "master" private/public pair and you won't have to worry about losing your coins as you exhaust the hidden keypool. One advantage of Armory's wallet (not sure about electrum) is that the the "master" public key can be used to derive nearly infinite number of child public keys without knowledge of the private keys. This has a lot of advantages. Say you didn't want to store your private keys on a webserver but you wanted to create separate receive address (on the fly) for each transaction. With a deterministic wallet, this is possible.

I like the idea. How about this: put a trezor with a transmitter on it that powers on and broadcasts a public address that it generated after arrival to a planet (or moon)... no one knows the private key and the only way to get it is to send a mission to retrieve it. Essentially sets up an X-Prize to land there.

Specialized hardware to perform scrypt (or your algo of choice) would not be far off if it became economical to do so. In addition, switching to a different algo effectively destroys a large portion of the hashing power of the network. You would have to account for difficulty changes. There's a myriad of problems that would occur to try to fix a perceived problem that is inherent in the proof-of-work solution to the byzantine general problem. If we use proof-of-work, it will always be a race to get the most efficient and powerful mining hardware on the planet. If you can think of generalized solution to that problem that still uses proof-of-work, publish it. I don't think it's possible. The other approach I know of uses a proof-of-stake, which is interesting, but I haven't devoted enough time to look at the disadvantages of it, but I believe it was streets ahead people would switch to that alt-coin (ppcoin).
Maybe we could setup a fallback hashing algo or use rotating hashing algos to prevent a large attacker from destroying the network, but at this point any switch that I can think of would make it easier for an entity to attack, not harder.
Right now we are in the process of bootstrapping Bitcoin to become a major currency. NO matter what we did at this point, if a major power wanted to destroy confidence in the network by performing a 51% attack they would be able to do it; however, at this point it would be incredibly bold to do so. Would you really want to anger this many people with this much technical expertise? These people would pick up the pieces, figure out what broke, fix it, and do it again. That's the beauty of software. There is only so many iterations that the war can be fought on... 51% attack, restart bitcoin with a more resistant hashing algorithm or with a different solution to the double spend problem; block clearnet, switch to tor; shutdown internet, switch to HAM radio meshnets.
I think that sometime in the future the algorithm will need to changed and it should favor decentralization of the mining power, but there is a whole lot of externalities to making that change, and it should only be done with great care, deliberation, and debate.

I took time to word that sentence, notice I said how many "are created" not "in circulation." Regardless, I don't see destruction of coins as a problem for the health of the system as a whole, owing to the divisibility of the currency. The usable money supply of bitcoin is impossible to know, but I think reasonable guesses can be made. An early adopter could be sitting on a huge proportion of the unmoved coins, or they could be lost forever, but I think the people that were originally involved in this system never saw it as a get rich quick scheme. Satoshi (if he was one person) seemed to have some clear motivations for creating bitcoin, I don't see him dumping a million coins into circulation to "cash out." It's his baby. Likewise, I don't see the other developers doing that as well. Eventually they will be able to buy their yacht in BTC anyway, if their grand plan works out.
This is a bit tangential, but bear with me. Suppose a large bitcoin owner sitting on a few million coins saw that the "dreaded" deflationary spiral was occurring in his beloved bitcoin economy. If he wanted, he could "release" some of his coins to "ease" the problem... Of course, he couldn't release more coins than he owned, but he could potentially release enough coins to change the trajectory and the spending habits of the rest of the ecosystem's denizens. Now lets replace this bitcoin millionaire with a entity such as a corporation or a government. The entity originally started out with the sole purpose of "let's fix this road." So the members of the entity started out by making a billboard with a QR code and a simple message, "Assurance contract: Want these potholes fixed? Please send a satoshi to this address. Total raised: 140/200BTC." They raise the money and do the job so well that they get the road fixed, and have a couple BTC left over which they use for another public good. Eventually after doing such a good job for so long the entity has amassed a sizeable portion of the bitcoin economy. With that they become the de facto "Fed."

I think there is pretty good evidence that he was somewhere in the spectrum of anarchy or libertarianism. Not that it truly matters. I agree with you that bitcoin is compatible with other political views, but the idea of bitcoin was born out of frustration with central authorities, governments and banks included.
From the wiki:
* "Yes, [we will not find a solution to political problems in cryptography,] but we can win a major battle in the arms race and gain a new territory of freedom for several years. Governments are good at cutting off the heads of a centrally controlled networks like Napster, but pure P2P networks like Gnutella and Tor seem to be holding their own." - Satoshi Nakamoto
* "[Bitcoin is] very attractive to the libertarian viewpoint if we can explain it properly. I'm better with code than with words though." - Satoshi Nakamoto

Although I guess you could call that a vanity address, almost certainly no one know the private key to it. It just follows the bitcoin public address format. It's a very public way to "destroy" bitcoins. Here's another one:

If he spent twice from the same address before the secure random bug was patched then it's possible that it revealed the private key to someone earlier, but that doesn't really explain why the attacker would have waited. This will probably end up being malware.

That's a good point. 
So lets say our hypothetical treasury is more solvent now and it contains a few billions dollars worth of gold bullion. Now each bitcoin is at least worth $200 just by it being backed by that much gold. Now everyone would trade their bitcoins in to the treasury to get that gold so they can sell it on the open market (because after all bitcoins are only trading for $100 right now on the market). But people realize this and buy up the cheaper bitcoins until they rise in value to $200. 
At that point there's no longer a reason to get my gold out of the treasury... after all I know it's there... and bitcoins are a lot less heavy.... so I might as well keep them there. Besides this treasury is ran openly and has been very honorable. It's even a lot easier to send bitcoins to somebody in zimbabwe. They can come get the gold if they want it that bad.
I don't know if I'm making my point clear. I'll try to articulate it a little better later. ;)

Looking at that transaction, I think it will go through eventually. I wouldn't worry too much.

You are of course correct. I don't know what the transaction volume limiting step is in bitcoin network. I do know that very smart people are working on it and they are very attuned to the economics of the system. See: 
and the multiple discussions where the devs hang out (for the most part they stay away from reddit). 
@_date: 2013-05-25 19:03:00
Also, I'm not sure how electrum generate its private/public keypairs deterministically, but if you leak one private key then you may have leaked a lot of information about that wallet's other private keys (lowered the entropy). It would still not be enough to brute force if you leaked an armory generated private key, but I haven't looked into electrum's algorithm.
Edit: See here: 
@_date: 2013-06-17 15:16:52
Ok, so you want them to get a similar looking address (which is hard), then spoof your bluetooth connection (which is not so hard, but not trivial), then they have to have your client-side PIN code so your trezor will even acknowledge the transaction, and then you have to rely on somebody being stupid enough not to review the value of the transaction with the address and amount put in front of them. The attack vector is small.
It would just be easier to steal the trezor and your pin code than anything else, especially if they are close enough to you to spoof your bluetooth connection.
The battery would of course be rechargeable. I haven't done the consumption calculations but my gestalt tells me the device would not require a recharge but once every few days (if that).
My device would make POS systems at brick and mortar stores easier and more secure than simply using a cell phone. If you are using your trezor as a cold storage device it obviously not the right product for you, and I don't believe the trezor was envisioned as a cold storage device. It certainly is less secure than an offline generated wallet, which is what I use for my "savings." My trezor will be my "spending" wallet.

@_date: 2013-05-26 16:03:03
Correct, I should have worded that way. You reveal your public key the first time you sign and broadcast a transaction. So if you have more coins in that address after that your coins would be vulnerable to an attack using an advanced quantum computer (that doesn't exist yet). I guess I was trying to simplify it and the best way for me to explain it was to simply say don't spend twice from the same address, I should have said spend only once from an address.
Not that any of this matters for the next 10 years or longer. By then we can hopefully move to a signature algorithm that is resistant to quantum computers.

Hey, I wrote that guide and PM'd it to him... guess I should have spent more time with it...
You are safe as long as you figure out how to use them correctly. There are ways to look at a transaction before you sign and broadcast it, BTW. Probably the easiest way to figure it out is use a small amount in a completely different paper wallet to spend from.
The nice part about Armory is the wallet codes are deterministic and it will warn you before you do most stupid things. I'll stress this over and over.... if you are spending from paper wallets be sure you know what change addresses are and how miner fees work.
Bitcoin still has some growing to do and this illustrates it very clearly. Trezor is a great first step.
Also notice I wrote "almost" maximum paranoia... there's actually 2 attack vectors that I see from when I wrote the guide, both are extraordinarily unlikely to happen.

@_date: 2013-11-20 21:17:15
I'll post what I posted - 
Bitcoin is really really complicated in its intricacies. This is going to be a long explanation that is going to speak about some historically about the invention of Bitcoin and why I think that the deflationary model is the only model that *would* work for a decentralized cryptocurrency (at least the first of its kind).
First, lets talk about what problem bitcoin solves. It is a problem of distributed consensus without trusting individual players. Bitcoin is about managing a shared ledger amongst all the players in the bitcoin network. As long as half of the processing power of the network is behaving honestly then that ledger is maintained correctly. Any actor can take their processing power and do with it whatever they want. They can try to "double-spend" transactions (spend their bitcoin "honestly" and "dishonestly" and then block the honest bitcoin transaction from the ledger) and they can attempt to block honest transactions from occuring (by controlling the official ledger book). These dishonest things have to be discouraged. To make this happen you have to incentivize participating honestly. The only way to do that really is to provide a occasional reward in the form of extra bitcoins to honest, and rational, players.
So why the hell would we put all this work into a forming a decentralized electronic currency? Because it has properties that can be teased out of it that are impossible to be done with traditional fiat currencies. Things like setting up trusts/wills/pay-as-you go transactions. A legally-agnostic title system. Other things like setting up autonomous agents (agents that are programmed to self-sustain themselves without a traditional owner: you can't open a bank account if you are a mall kiosk, the owner has to open it; but with bitcoin a mall kiosk can open itself an account). There's also many more uses for a decentralized digital currency. So that's really the **goal**. The properties of bitcoin are not the same as any other type of financial instrument or security in existence. They rely on legal bodies, bitcoin relies on the *distributed* trust of its participants.
So now comes the question: If I designed a currency to solve the problem of distributed consensus, how can I get people to start using it early on? How can I get them to abandon SETI and protein folding? What economic model should I use to assure the highest rate of adoption? In that case I want to reward people for participating as early as possible and I want people to understand as simply as possible that getting in early is a good thing. So how do I do that... I setup a hard cap of 21M bitcoins which guarantees that if my system becomes successful, the people who put the most work into it and innovate around it will be handsomely rewarded. This is where bitcoin gets it "Ponzi scheme" and "Tulip bulb" detractors. But this wasn't setup as a get rich quick scheme, Satoshi designed it in such a way that it rewarded hard workers (people who add the use cases such as Bitpay/Coinbase etc.) and early adopters (Hal Finney). It was by necessity that bitcoin was designed to be deflationary.
It even says on bitcoin.org that bitcoin is "experimental." It's a proof of concept, and it has proved its concept! It has paved the way for other alternative decentralized currencies to exist, that may not reward early adopters as much, but are perhaps more fine-tuned. A lot of the alt-coins are just scams to make their creators rich in a first place, but others have tweaked properties [Litecoin has a different form of mining function, Freicoin has built in demurrage (inflationary), Peercoin uses a different form of distributed consensus called proof of stake]. None of these would have existed if it weren't for Satoshi's contributions though.
**Now I'll attempt to address each of your critiques individually:**


It's a fixed *divisible* supply. Something that cannot occur with most physical materials "easily." Sure I could shave a sliver of gold off a bar, but I can't easily do it without tools. With Bitcoin, it's just as easy to send 0.001 bitcoins as it is 10 bitcoins.
So let's say that almost all bitcoins are hoarded or lost (people think they are so valuable they won't trade for them under any circumstances). Do you really believe that no one, and I mean no one will want to part with 0.0000001 bitcoins for a new jet? I certainly would. Remember there's only 0.0035 bitcoins available per person on earth (actually less than that). If they are mostly held in reserve, the fungible bitcoins will still have quite a bit of value.


Most bitcoin users have several different wallets and have stored their bitcoins in multiple different ways. Personally I have a "hot" wallet on my computer with backup on a USB stick and I have a encryped "offline" paper wallet stored in an undisclosed location. I also have some in my reddit tipbot account to give to unsuspecting people. The key to this is that I have multiple backups. It's also getting easier every day to backup and save bitcoin. Electrum starts up with a 12 word phrase that you can write down to save you. A new hardware wallet called trezor will do the same.


This is my least favorite critique of bitcoin. US Pennies are literally worth less than the metal they contain, and that after they stopped being made from copper. The paper in $100 dollar bill is worth almost exactly the same as the paper in the $1 dollar bill. Why? Because the people who use them have "faith" in the centralized authority of the US Government and accept them as valuable. But I can't take my $100 dollar bill to the US Govt and tell them to give me $100 dollars worth of gold. I can find someone to trade my $100 dollar bill with the assumption they will be able to give it to somebody else for goods and services. Bitcoin is used by people who have "faith" in their decentralized consensus... it's the direct democracy of fiat currency. Most of USD, Yen, Euros, etc. do not exist physically either, they exist in the computers and ledgerbooks of banks, governments, and other financial institutions... why are their ledgerbooks and computers more trustworthy than ours?


This is true and as function of time should improve... Right now any billionaire in the world could skyrocket the value of bitcoin and any early adopter in the world (Satoshi probably owns close to 1 million coins) could drop the value like a rock. But as the market cap and trade volume increases that type of manipulation becomes less viable and more likely to be zero-sum game for the players. Especially as the majority of the exchange volume is occurring against tighter regulations. There's positives and negatives to that, but I'll leave that argument for another time. But that's the other point of why deflation is needed: why would a rational player get into buying bitcoin if they know that their coins will be devalued in the future AND its very volatile in the beginning. They wouldn't... and therefore the bitcoin system could have never come to be because no one would want to invest in it (whether that be in time, other fiat currencies, etc.)


I'll just leave that one alone for the most part. In order for that to occur almost all players must have the same epiphany (bitcoin has no value at any exchange rate) at the same time for it to occur. Otherwise there will always be a market. I'll conclude with a bit of levity. 
**Why do I think mid-cap companies should consider using bitcoin**... it's the cool thing to do, the risk associated is relatively low and the potential benefits are high. It will also give them experience if Bitcoin doesn't become the "next big thing" as far as cryptocurrencies are concerned. Their staff will be experienced in implementing it and will be able to apply that to future "fiat-agnostic" payment systems.
@_date: 2013-06-26 23:49:24
Somebody deleted their comment, so I'll just put this here as a response. I thought his reasoning was actually pretty good.
 - Lol you got me.
I agree that there is a problem with reversibility of transactions. However, I actually think some of those problems are going to be fixed with "recentralization" of cryptocurrencies. For example, an entity will have reserve cryptocurrency and use it to back their centralized digital currency that has a particular set of properties that they want to retain.
I think cryptocurrency is going to be huge. I don't know if it's going to be Bitcoin, but I think we are going to have "flavors" of cryptocurrency - but the most trusted ones will be decentralized/distributed, which means by necessity they will require a proof of work or stake protocol. If you can think of a better way let me know.
The reason I think cryptocurrency is going to be *huge* is that we haven't even gotten close to implementing it well. The technology has **obvious** applications that simply haven't been well developed because the smart devs are working hard on infrastructural problems currently. If you haven't seen Mike Hearn's lecture from a year or two ago on smart contracts, I would highly recommend watching it. Smart contracts, when well implemented, will take a huge chunk out of title/property management. Is Mike working on this stuff? Maybe a little, but it seems to me that he's primarily working on a bitcoin node written in Java. They are working on making the blockchain more robust, they are adding deterministic support, abstracting away the public addresses from the end-user experience. All of this stuff is going to reach a critical mass. If it fails, another cryptocurrency will take its place.
Ideas such as smart contracts, trusted oracles, and other tech built on top of the blockchain idea will be revolutionary. I don't know if it will become a predominant currency, but I still think the idea (and probably Bitcoin itself) is way undervalued.

No problem. 
A couple things to note about the bitcoin community. There are a lot of "OMG!!! Bitcoin is best ever!" Lots of excitement, which can be offputting, I got the "SCAM" and "CULT" vibe immediately on learning about it, but over several months of reading about what is going on behind the scenes, what it really is about, I became really excited, too. 
That being said, there are a lot of conartists and such that use bitcoin, due to the fact that there are no chargebacks and it is pseudonymous, so you have to be wary of that. Think of a bitcoin transaction as handing cash to a stranger. Your level of trust should reflect that. Once you send your money somewhere to someone else, it is gone. No calling VISA or Paypal and saying you didn't mean to, there isn't a mechanism for getting your money back. So be careful, read about it, understand the basics. You don't have to be an expert cryptographer or anything.

ideas: a way of solving the kinds of problems James lists here, of
creating a globally consistent but decentralized database; and then using
it for a system similar to Wei Dai's b-money (which is referenced in the
paper) but transaction/coin based rather than account based. Solving the
global, massively decentralized database problem is arguably the harder
part, as James emphasizes. The use of proof-of-work as a tool for this
purpose is a novel idea well worth further review IMO." - Hal Finney

Just going to correct a misconception that I keep seeing in this thread. The difficulty doesn't change every two weeks. It recalculates every 2016 blocks, so if the hashrate drops to 50% then confirmations change to 20 minutes AND the recalculation won't occur until 4 weeks (as a worst case).
The people in the know are aware of this... and there are number of strategies that have been suggested.
All the other points are valid, it's game theory and Satoshi designed the system to be a feedback loop... the mining hashrate should change to be close to being just *slightly* profitable. Hashrate doesn't normally drop down quickly... people don't want to miss the next price runup and so will continue to mine at a slight loss. This is irrational behavior because the individuals could just use the money they saved from a lower electricity bill to buy bitcoins at a higher rate that they can mine, but for some reason, they continue to mine... and that has been seen multiple times in the past.
The road for bitcoin is going to be rocky (and probably rockier than people in this subreddit expect), but it's also going to be successful for as long as we have bright individuals working together to make it happen.

Here's the most up-to-date discussion that was freely available that I could find. 
It seems like there is a pretty good amount of research in it (for obvious reasons).
As far as blocking bots, I don't see that ever being completely eliminated. A lot of the online poker players use statistic suites (Holdem manager, etc.) anyway... and that's not considered cheating for the most part.

Well crap. You just missed the cutoff... One minute. I'll refill a little bit to give you some.

I hate to admit it, but I'm a fan of Scott Adams. I've read at least two of his books and think that he's a brilliant, but flawed, individual. He posted some misogynistic comments a couple years ago on his blog then used a sockpuppet on Metacritic (I think) to defend himself. The sockpuppet was named after a Von Mises Book.
He actually may be a reserved fan of Bitcoin, it would suit a lot of his views. He also owns a restaurant (or at least he used to) in CA... wonder if he could strike up a deal with Coinbase. ;)

Or just do this: 
Just kidding. Thanks I was on my phone and couldn't verify. Good to see he has the private key. I was beginning to worry for a second.

I can't refer you to a source other than the bitcoin source code, but the above mentioned algorithm is a random number generator algorithm and while it uses elliptical curves in a similar way to ECC signature algorithms it is significantly different. Cryptographers have been suspicious of it since before the inception of bitcoin. The curve that bitcoin uses is secp256k1 which is something called a koblitz curve (or something like that... Too drunk and tired to Google it)

I would approach it like Anthony Gallippi does in this video. Don't talk about the blockchain, talk about the features. When people ask about "how is this possible?" "What prevents double spending?" Then introduce some of the technical details.
Also you are a lot more likely to get a friendly audience from the CS/ECE department than you will from the financial guys ;)

My default advice is to see a doctor in a hospital or clinic when I'm asked about anything that I'm not 100% sure of. Its not that I can't give advice it's just my malpractice insurance might not cover me in that situation. Additionally there are a lot of state licensing bylaws that I would have to review (with a lawyer).

This is actually a good idea... Look to see if bitcoin.conf is present and if it is post it here... Just redact any personal info first. Even if bitcoin is run from a different folder it may still look in %APPDATA%\Bitcoin\ for the bitcoin.conf file.
So if that is the case then all they would have to do is wait for your other client to come online and then sendtoaddress API call and they are done.

The government of the US only forces people to use USD for all *debts* public and private. I don't have to accept it at my business if I don't want to. I do have to pay my income taxes though if I don't want to go to jail. Personally, I do not believe bitcoin is the one true currency... it doesn't have to be, it just should be used in situations where it clearly makes sense to use.


And that's precisely my point. Bitcoin is not part of the US economy or the Chinese economy. It's commensurate to the people that use it, and they exists in all nations. Government should be by the people and of the people. And that's precisely what Bitcoin is. The Constitution of Bitcoin is written down at github. It lives on a network composed up of people who live in many nations.
I have never used my bitcoins for the purchase or sell of illegal drugs, unless you count some beer I bought with it. I doubt Gavin Andresen or Mike Hearn are buying drugs either. The majority of the economy is most certainly passing through third party intermediates that convert Bitcoin to Government issued currencies, but that is by necessity as I've previously explained. The value of Bitcoin is currently extremely tiny, I completely agree. But, if you don't consider FX to be part of an economy, that's just silly. I'm sure marijuana suppliers in Humboldt convert their Bitcoins to fiat as well. I guess drug sells don't even count as part of the "real Bitcoin economy" anyway.
Edit: removed redundancy

Could we walk you through setting up a wallet and buying something online with bitcoin? We'd rather have a Senator share in the excitement than ask questions we already know the answer to.
We want a favorable regulatory environment... anything else will mean work will leave to overseas. Bitcoin is international and crossing borders is near frictionless, especially if other countries are active users. See:  - Currently the US is the leader in bitcoin enthusiasts, followed closely by European countries (Germany especially),  China, Russia, UK (in no particular order)... If we do not work towards having a friendly regulatory environment then a lot of business (especially digital services) will go to countries that have less regulatory burden.
I'm not a constituent of your fair state (I'm little further south), but I've been a Bitcoin user for several years and many of the hurdles are directly due to perceived legitimacy of the currency. When it becomes successful, it will even the playing field between large corporations and mom-and-pop stores. Listen for that when the BitPay CEO speaks, he's telling you the truth!
If you have further questions, please come back to ask them. :)

Well, I have never mined before (except for like 0.2 BTC a year ago), but recently participated in a group buy of Avalon ASIC chips... Will hopefully have them in August. Think I'll break even, but not much more than that. I'll have to wait and see. Here's hoping BFL remains as consistent as ever. I'll be happy to run them at a loss just to help secure the network some and it's negligible to my income anyway.
So chock up one for decentralizing the network.
@_date: 2013-05-26 00:01:22
No, it would still be unknown and (practically) unbreakable. There is a known attack that makes spending twice from the same public address infinitesimally more vulnerable, but it's currently unfeasible and will be for quite a long while.

I also think it would be nice to setup a [assurance contract]( system with The originator of the tip gets to decide if the receiver gets the coins or if they are returned to everyone. Would that possible I would happy to donate a little to that cause as well.

How do you feel that some of the big names in cryptography are publishing articles like this? Do they ever consult with you or any of the other devs before publishing their findings? 
This blockchain analysis is going to be a "polygraph machine" in the future... people will think it's a lot more conclusive than it actually is.
@_date: 2013-12-22 23:15:50
Except that's not true.
There's a spike at (8/11/2013) that has no correlation to price changes. Some of those spike occur a day after the price drops as well. Additionally the second highest spike (11/01/2013) and another slightly smaller on (10/28/2013) occurs before the latest price run up.
Here's the overlay so you can actually freak yourself out some more (this is over the last year). [Imgur](
@_date: 2013-12-27 22:08:03
Yeah... no. 
If I had a Bitcoin for every time somebody claimed that they had proven P=NP or P!=NP and published a paper I would have a lot of bitcoins.
Edit: I know expert opinion is the lowest form of evidence, but I think this has a lot of good reading in it.
@_date: 2013-06-21 22:03:45
My guess is somewhere around 100K (I think I'm on the low end, too).  provides a good estimation of nodes (mostly full bitcoin-qt installs) and there are quite a lot of active nodes. If there are only 0.0014 % of the population using bitcoin, we have a lot of room to grow.

Would Kipochi work for you? I don't completely understand their service but it sounds like a bridge between MPesa and Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-11-07 15:30:33
Nah... it will quiet down soon. If I want in depth discussion I go to the dev board on bitcointalk or github. It's fun to watch the new interest, I just don't want it all to hinge on the exchange rate. I do see your point though.
