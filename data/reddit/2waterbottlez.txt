Nothing keep doing your thing sell low buy low seems like a solid plan.. 
@_date: 2017-01-11 13:57:23

There should be a daily discussion thread everyday on this sub sorted by new comments first. Would like that.

Nope, not the same big names here.. but they are all still connected somehow most likely.

Why is this downvoted? I have my investment BTC backed up on 2 multibit wallet created locally on USB's while offline for cold storage.

You can get a good VPN service with lots of locations.

Well with my ideas it would still be treated as a digital currency with the bitcoin bank just being a physical accesory, like a trezor with a live accountant managing your cold wallet with you. Trezor is good because it is built by bitcoin users, I would never use a bitcoin bank that was created by Bank of America, etc... it would have to be made correctly, open and simple, simple, trustworthy, local, semi-hands on, anonymous, etc.

Used QCX for the first time though, the EFT was nice.

Some seller on LBC will buy you anything for your bitcoin. Try a seller who claims they will buy you "ANY" giftcard from a store, they will probably buy you a ticket for a increased rate. Or harass the venue until they take you bitcoins or hashcoins.

The last 2 or so nights I go to sleep knowing the price is rising overnight (eastern time), as it very slowly rises all day. I was expecting to wakeup to maybe 307 after going to sleep with it at 300. 315 was better. I'm 18 and have 19+ BTC and making around $200 profit off bitcoin raising every night while I'm sleeping. I'm putting my coins in cold storage asap, no way I'm selling, sold $900 worth about a week ago, bitcoin price still tweakin ho

The big diffrence would be the online/offline aspect. Offline has the potential to easily be simple, trustworthy, local, semi-hands on, anonymous, etc. I could  see a physical bitcoin bank branch could be perfect. Well if anyone or any bank wants to start this count me in!!

It is lack of dope-amine in the brain. I have ADHD and my Adderrall helps aton, but smoking weed does the same thing with less juugs. My focus is extreme when smoking weed, when I'm normal I can't focus on 1 thing at all. 
OP, yes I obsess over bitcoin and check the price a couple times too much per day, but doesn't every bitcoin holding geek do the same?

Local cash trade escrow. You get cash, leave, release.

I can vouch for Quadrige selling bitcoin for EFT is great. It shows up as a payroll deposit very fast.
@_date: 2015-07-23 16:12:54
Well this idea provides 100% safety for face-to-face.. I've always wondered why LBC doesn't support it. It provides the seller and the buyer full protection from robbing anything.

Sold $900 worth at around (i think) 327 last week. :''''(

I sent the coin to a site to pay for something not my wallet.
@_date: 2016-10-26 19:04:58
did you get it yet? i still have 0 confirmations over 24 hr later. 
@_date: 2016-10-25 23:07:07
I have done around 10 transactions today, only the very first one i did is still not confirmed. Don't know much technical stuff about btc, but both our frozen transactions are 225 bytes and sent 15 mins apart from eachother both with 0.0001 fee.. we're in this together.
