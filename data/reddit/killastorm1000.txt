I disagree, investing a small amount ($50~) and going in it for the ride is a new experience and a learning experience for us 'amateurs'. However, I agree with you on the fact that people shouldn't invest large amounts of money in it atm (like the people who took out college loans to buy in at 250.)

Well this makes me wish I didn't sell almost a bitcoin when it was at like $120 :(
@_date: 2013-04-12 07:43:32
Honestly $20 seems like a more reliable estimate.

How much is "slightly"?

That said, if you NEED the money back then you definitely shouldn't invest in bitcoin. Bitcoin is extremely volatile and could go anyway, if you're going to invest money in bitcoins then it should be money that you can afford to lose.
tl;dr: don't be that guy who took out student loans to buy bitcoins.

Much thanks! :D

Someone should make an app that makes the sound of an avalanche when Bitcoin crashes, and something else cool when it goes up.

I'm not very skilled with photoshop and stuff like that, but I'm okay with 3d modelling. So I decided to make this :P Unfortunately the colour range is really limited.

I sold my bitcoin at $130 months ago. I didn't lose anything, I just didn't get the extra $1100, it's important to look at what you didn't lose.

Sure! At the moment this is only a one sided design so I'll overhaul it a bit to make it double-sided for you.

Ok, is there any difference between GUIMiner and CGMiner?

You need to polish it more, get rid of the jagged edges all over the place

I'm sure everyone in Africa is just waiting to get on their Alienware laptops to see how much their Bitcoin is worth.

With the current bitcoin limit of 21 million, each bitcoin would have to cost (after they've all been generated, which they haven't) $140,000, which I find highly unlikely.

If only someone would send me an extremely large transaction :(
