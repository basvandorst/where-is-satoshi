That says $100 million.
We are all also assuming that they have entirely honest about how much cryptocurrency they own--I think some of the people browsing the "Bitcoin" subreddit are forgetting that one of the great powers of cryptocurrency is being able to keep your wealth completely private.
If you were someone who is relatively famous, would you tell the public about your entire crypto wealth when you could be kidnapped/extorted/blackmailed for that same amount (considering the entire security of your wealth is your own responsibility).

Neither do we assume their entire wealth will be judged just by their investment in bitcoins.
Typically predictions are only partly based upon research--I've made a fairly wild prediction that their ideas concerning cryptocurrency will generate them this wealth and not their actual (current) quantifiable wealth in bitcoins.
Also, seeing as the bitcoin market cap is currently ~11.5 billion US dollars I wouldn't hesitate in guessing that there are a few people out there who aren't entirely public about how much they own.

A decentralized version of Facebook 'could' easily take the spotlight (as fast as Facebook took over the spotlight from MySpace).
I don't particularly find it interesting to count the dollars of either party--I do find it interesting having read about the Zuckerberk/Winklevoss relationship (and obviously having seen the movie).
I just think it would be pretty funny if we lived in a world where the movie "The Social Network" exists and then sometime after that the twins became richer than Zuckerberg.

One of the great aspects (for me) of bitcoin is that you can effectively be on any continent on earth with no money or possessions and only using a computer or phone (without any identification) have access to your money.
I don't understand why you wouldn't have a cloud backup.
Not only that, robberies happen, houses catch on fire, you forget where you hide stuff, hard drives die etc etc etc etc. A cloud storage provider has one job: to make sure you data is backed up.
@_date: 2015-01-25 13:47:45
Surely you can figure out for yourself what near future encompasses when it relates to how long humans currently live?
Do you think I'm making a prediction for 400 years in the future or something?
It is just a prediction or a question if you want to call it that; could the Winklevoss twins become successful outside of the realm of social networking? Sometimes questions don't need to have that much information to be interesting or make us think.
@_date: 2015-01-25 13:59:56
So you're saying a social media network and/or text messaging network (lets face it, the fact that Whatsapp is owned by Facebook yet Facebook has its own separate chat service is completely stupid) that comes along and offers less advertisements, more freedom and the ability to work on all platforms (Whatsapp is only coming to PC now, and it cannot work without a mobile phone).
Instagram is also mobile-only despite the fact it doesn't need to be.
Don't think about Facebook as " Someone could EASILY come along and offer everything for nothing to the end user (i.e. less privacy concerns) and then facebook would become MySpace in a few short months.
Also, Facebook is predominantly tailored towards English speaking languages to some extent; consider the fact that continents like Africa and Asia are going to have real internet access in the near future, so non-English languages can easily find a home elsewhere.
When you think about it, consider what things Facebook doesn't offer right now:
-purchasing games/movies/music/newspaper content despite the fact all of these are mentioned, advertised or referenced through social media posts on a day to day basis.
-sending/receiving money from anyone anywhere (on your PC, laptop, smartphone etc)
-notifying you that milk in your fridge is out of date/empty and you need to order some from the store
-letting you order items for delivery
-letting you book hotel stays/travel
-letting you book restaurants (imagine sending out a FB/social media invite to a birthday party at a restaurant and having the number of seats be automatically tailored to the number of people who RSVP).
When I say near future in the context of this discussion all I've had is people ask "What do you mean by the near future?"--it sounds like the people reading this are asking me how long a piece of string is rather than using their own intuition to imagine how long a piece of string could be.
And yes, some of the things I've pointed out here will have huge legal restrictions and red tape--things that would take Facebook considerable expense to adapt to due to its size (that is what I believe anyway) which is exactly the reason I believe that Facebook is no more invulnerable than MySpace.
Decentralized versions of preexisting services (Google, Facebook, YouTube, Dropbox) could easily take over in the span of just a few years (if the technology is right).

@_date: 2015-01-25 08:39:07
That is assuming their entire wealth is tied to bitcoins and that their ideas amount to nothing other than increasing the value of bitcoins.
@_date: 2015-01-25 08:37:15
Fair call; I'm much more interesting in how much more value digital currency will provide to society compared to Facebook.
@_date: 2015-01-25 13:46:12
Yes that is another factor.
Even if the Winklevoss twins don't actually overtake his wealth and only manage to come somewhere near it would be interesting.

Facebook is a behemoth. It is unlikely Zuckerberg would turn up to work one day and just merrily decide to implement some form of cryptocurrency in the span of a few hours/days.
@_date: 2015-03-13 09:30:05
Wasn't something like this bound to happen sooner or later?  Better now so it can be acted against rather than any further into the future.
@_date: 2015-02-04 14:28:28
Fair call. But the same thing still applies: if there was a strong enough vulnerability someone out there would be rich. This is all you need to explain to people (like me) who can't be bothered to read that much into how encryption works.
I'm not saying it isn't worth investigating these flaws for the sake of improving cryptocurrency, I'm just saying that at this point in time it is impossible to break so it still remains 100% safe (besides physical theft/hacking etc).
More interestingly the USD, Euro and probably every major currency has at one point or another been forged--does this mean these currencies are actually less secure than bitcoin?

Fair call. I still have not placed my vote (I will be doing it in a day or two and trying to make as much of a fair/balanced decision as possible).
It is worth noting that the Bitcoin Foundation has claimed the following:
"Bruce Fenton: Received and opened emails sent on January 20, February 6 and February 9. All of which contained information and instructions for the upcoming election. He did receive but did not open the email sent on February 3."
(source:  )
The information on who opened/didn't open emails was provided via their MailChimp account.
I may decide to vote for someone else in light of this revelation, but I am still going to hold off on voting for now.
@_date: 2015-03-11 19:50:40
I think that the price will be governed by supply and demand.
Considering most of the trading against bitcoin is done from China I'd say all this talk about the psychology of certain prices in USD is completely meaningless just as trying to predict what a completely decentralized currency means to different people in different places.
The only thing worth mentioning for me is that imho its more than likely the price will rubberband and crash at some point soon (especially once people cut a good 50% profit from their purchases)

Can the government even claim tax on bitcoins if someone has already paid tax on them when purchasing? If they can, doesn't that mean citizens can double dip everything the government does too?

Sorry I haven't slept much in the past few days--my inaccurate claim was that you were already a board member.

Such is your right, however, judging people by their appearance when it comes to a border-less currency speaks more about you than any candidate.
In my opinion if you truly understand the concept of bitcoin then you will be making your decision based upon words and communications and not the visual appearance of any candidate.

Time will tell. I'm interested in it both as an economy and as a technology; I think blockchain technology will change the world extremely quickly and I think that we're at a point where so many people are trying to make the next big company that it is bound to start gaining serious momentum soon.
I would also be interested to see how much bitcoin costs the environment compared to all the banks, bank employees, ATM, security guards and so on that the current banking system requires. Also, as I'm sure most people are aware there are cryptocurrencies right now which aren't as inefficient--there will of course be developments with any technology.

you'd just use something like lastpass which only fills in your details on the legit website (as far as I know, I've never seen it fill in a fake website). You should also use services like admuncher or an adblocker as well as a firewall in conjunction with a modern browser like Google Chrome or Firefox; all of these combined will weed out a great deal of malicious content from the internet.

That is why it would be used in conjunction with 2FA or a strong password. Sure it isn't infallible, but neither is any of the security we use--even if I was to suggest using AES-256 someone would come along and say its flawed even though it would take several billion times the world's GDP to decrypt it (yes there are flaws in the algorithms supposedly, but if someone could crack it that easily they would be a multi billionaire/trillionaire by now).
Just because biometrics aren't perfect, doesn't mean they shouldn't be made available or considered by users.
@_date: 2015-02-14 23:35:49
I also made this point:
"I think the problem is many cryptocurrency enthusiasts basically live on reddit/bitcointalk and don't branch out or pay attention to much else (read: hivemind)
Looking at the most recent threads on bitcointalk I cannot find a single thread that is discussing the election."
(  )
It is difficult to gather proof of whether emails were actually sent. I can confirm I received the email. I also read about it on several other places. If people cannot pay attention to what the requirements of the foundation are then they are probably just hanging out on bitcointalk or here 99% of the time (i.e. hivemind people).
We may have the convenience of information being delivered to our door but everyone still has a responsibility to learn beyond what is provided and linked to on just two forums on the internet. I personally believe hivemind attitudes are a grave danger to the basis of the internet.
Regardless of the outcome of this 18% situation I will not be using this as part of my voting decision and instead will learn about candidates as much as possible from as many sources as possible before casting my vote (I believe I still have around 5 days left).
@_date: 2015-02-04 14:45:06
I see what you mean; you're saying that if bitcoin keeps its GST status, perhaps we would be made exempt from paying GST when using it as a currency? That actually makes sense; it would also stop the government caring about price fluctuations as much (I suppose).
In my opinion, I think that in 10-15 years the entire tax system will be done away with and tax will be a flat rate on all transactions; which I think is how it should be done anyway. That way you would be taxing people based upon how much money/resources they spend.
@_date: 2015-02-04 16:13:12
But this new technology also means humans could potentially vote using their wallets (exactly what companies do right now); don't like a cause? Then don't support it.
@_date: 2015-02-04 14:37:49
Regardless the same concepts still apply. I had a friend on chat the other day who hadn't even read into bitcoin at all and was convinced that he could overpower the encryption and security somehow.
When I said that if anyone could do it they would be a multi billionaire (on top of probably being able to access every computer on Earth) he got angry and eventually removed me as a friend.
To anyone who does think they have a chance of breaking modern encryption using a PC and grandma's AOL connection consider this for a second:
"If you were simply brute forcing every possible key, there would be 2^256 keys you need to try. You'd expect to find it after going through (on average) half of the keys, so average expected number of attempts would be 2^255. This is a Really Big Number. If every atom on earth (about 1.3 * 10^50 atoms) was a computer that could try ten billion keys a second, it would still take about 2.84 billion years." --
Given the fact that humans can barely co-operate when it comes to helping one another, I think it may just be impossible (within our lifetimes) for encryption to be broken. By the time it is possible, current technologies will have been superseded.

As a voter, I find this all somewhat absurd. I had no idea candidates would have no idea about any of these requirements that are outlined in the foundation's bylaws. That being said, I'm not surprised to see that candidates obviously don't do much reading beyond this subreddit and a few select websites (i.e. guaranteed hiveminds who cannot think outside the box).
It actually seems preposterous that people can't operate an email account in 2015, or pay attention to an election/foundation that they presumably paid to join.

More than one computer security expert (including Hal Finney) have predicted huge data breaches occurring in the near future.
Darkleaks also recently was released and is basically a marketplace that will allow people to sell confidential data anonymously (in theory anyway, only time will tell if someone actually ends up getting arrested from it).

Yes, its also important to consider exactly how many jobs are going to be forever made redundant in the coming decades due to inventions such as drones and driverless cars.
The concept of jobs/work will inevitably change; there are many articles out there that are predicting that most people will not need to work in the future. I guess the people that do work will do it because they love to do it, or perhaps there will be some different advantage besides monetary rewards.

I've invested in a few such as BURST, MAIDSAFE, DRK, DNOTE, SJCX, XCP, GEMZ, LTC as well as a host of other coins that I've put a lot less into.
As to whether they will pay off or not who knows at this point in time; I just read the bitcointalk forums and try to do my own research and come to conclusions. My own opinion is that most of the people who talk about cryptocurrencies here (as well as on exchange chat rooms) typically do about 0 research when it comes to altcoins and are literally just gambling.
Some have decreased, some have increased, but my savings are at least kept in a decentralized form (rather than solely pinning my hopes on bitcoin).

I think you're wrong; I think we're sitting on the verge of exponential interest in the currency. A lot of ideas are hitting the market soon and it will be interesting to see how this factors into bitcoin's future.
As there aren't all that many coins, more widely used services would inevitably result in increased interest in the currency.
I'd say that if bitcoin itself does not have a surge in interest then another altcoin is bound to replace it.

-It is impossible for me to verify how much currently exists; it is well known that diamond sellers manipulate the market so I wouldn't put it past people who hold to do the same. I don't see why I should believe any government or entity that claims to have XYZ amount when gold is never actually used for much.
-Beyond looking shiny and known for being expensive and having some scientific applications it doesn't actually 'do' anything. It sits in a vault gathering dust.
-It is difficult to transport, difficult to verify to an end user, it costs money on a daily basis to keep secure (security guards that patrol buildings that were specifically made to hold gold bars).
-If it weren't for marriage, gold probably wouldn't be worth much today; in many countries people spend their life savings on gold for weddings and keep it as a show of wealth or an investment. As we move towards a world where gender segregation decreases and people increasingly ask whether this jeweler is actually necessary people will take less and less interest in it.
-Even if you wanted jewelry you could just buy fake gold and no one would be able to tell the difference unless they actually handled it personally.
-The only gold I have ever purchased has been thinly spread on the end of cable connectors or embedded inside circuit boards. I don't think I'd be the only one to say that.

Given that one of its strongest points is quicker transactions I wouldn't hold your breath when it comes to people not using it for exactly that. I would've thought that once enough people use the currency, those that do hold will drive the price up significantly (if even 1% of the world started using bitcoin, i.e. 72 million people then that would already be one coin for 3 people). I'm sure there is some complicated boring economics theory that explains all this but I prefer to use the terms "supply and demand".
If you're that interested in the long term you should check out dnotes (full disclosure: i own some but am not affiliated in any way with the company); they are preparing one of the first long-term crypto savings schemes for children, retirees etc. The world is a lot bigger than just bitcoin.

@_date: 2015-02-04 20:32:05
How would that even work?
Anyway, the price of all consumer goods including cars, electronics and such has come down dramatically in price over the years. Tying a cryptocurrency to what things cost to manufacture and sell today doesn't make sense if we KNOW the price is going to come down dramatically in the next 1-20 years (think about drone delivery, increasing use of robotics in manufacturing as well as increasing computer literacy worldwide).
@_date: 2015-02-04 22:01:47
It's not that I'm untrustworthy of actual gold, I'm untrustworthy of people and entities who claim it has a value despite it basically being shiny metal.
I know exactly how much bitcoin currently exists; I don't know how many coins have been burnt. When it comes to gold and fiat I don't know how much exists (more like don't trust) and I can never know how much has been burnt. I think for the purposes of a general use/long term currency bitcoin is fine in this regard as there will only ever be roughly ~20 million coins for a planet with 8 billion people.
On point number 4, gold jewelry is usually purchased for weddings or as a gift in a relationship--given that a decreasing number of people are getting married or even bothering with sex nowadays (if Japan is anything to go by) and that in turn means less people are going to be interested in gold. Sure there are people who buy themselves gold jewelry, and those who buy it as an investment--but the reality is that its a hugely expensive, insecure method of storing value unless you can afford armed guards. And yes, I totally agree that if it were to change as I've speculated it would take quite some time. Having said that, I think the adoption of cryptocurrencies will pick up dramatically in the coming months and people will start to lose interest in gold/fiat (specifically gold).
Diamonds is an even better example than gold, because it is well known that the price is manipulated by those that hold the diamonds. They have no interest in people knowing how many diamonds actually exist, because that could/would dramatically decrease the value.
IMHO, diamonds are also completely pointless (except for scientific purposes) and also require a huge amount of security.
It's also a good idea to think outside the box when it comes to this; how many young people do you know today who want jewelry? If you're wealthy or financially secure, then sure, but what about everyone else?
"A young American likely to purchase jewelry is someone between the ages of 27 and 35, is college educated, has an annual income of $44,685, and lives in one of the top 15 states that account for more than 70 percent of fine jewelry and diamond jewelry sales."-- 
What about those under the age of 27? Do young people care about jewelry anymore, or would they prefer having nice things that actually serve a purpose (i.e. a smartphone). What about those who are poor? Poor people cannot afford jewelry or gold, but using cryptocurrency even the dust in their wallets still counts for something.
Assuming there is a shift in the current generation (again I'd have to find actual proof of this beyond my blind assumption) that moves away from expensive jewelry in favor of other things then it could be as little as 10 years until those 15 year olds turn 25 and suddenly no one wants to buy expensive rocks or metal anymore.
If we weren't to use gold I would think natural resources we can actually use should become far more valuable and this is something I fully support--imagine a world where turning on the tap or light switch actually charged your bank account for every liter/watt used in an accountable manner?

Please also note that my comment said 'could'--I'm pretty sure the best any of us can do at this stage is speculate.

Completely fair to make the assertation; having said that you are only looking at bitcoin. IMHO another cryptocurrency will take over for day to day transactions and bitcoin will remain a long term/stable cryptocurrency. You're also thinking about yourself trying to move money to another entity using one instruction for $25; what about a company like Microsoft or McDonalds who probably send &amp; receive millions of individual transactions (that's not even considering how much each transaction is for) who could avoid those fees and the unnecessary time considerations (last time I checked there hasn't been a cryptocurrency that closes its offices on the weekend or in the evening).

Although this comment was not directed at me I still feel like providing a comment on it.
I believe that making the voting process fair in the next few years will be one of the most difficult challenges facing both bitcoin and the wider world. Absent of using biometric data or some other form of verification someone could have easily bought out this election with ~10,000 USD and a programmer (especially as there is no actual verification that people say they are who they are).
I have written my thoughts on this situation here:
Given that this is such a difficult task to accomplish, it is vitally important that the foundation abides by its current rules and does not falter just because people evidently did not pay attention to the voting process (that is my opinion anyway, make of it what you will).
@_date: 2015-02-14 23:29:24
Seeing as there are so few voters I think I should write a voting member profile:
As someone that is going to speak for you I am doing my due diligence and reading as much as possible about the candidates:
-the first action I took was to actually read the email titled "Confirm Your Membership to Vote in Elections" and act upon it, this puts me within the 18% of members who are able to receive and act upon a written communication (e-mail) in the year 2015.
-I have carefully studied the foundation's goals and aims.
-I am carefully reading the literature provided by the foundation and doing as much of my own research on each candidate as time allows.
-I am not affiliated with any organization and am interested in the decentralized aspects of the currency.
-I've never had access to real banking facilities (loans, credit cards) in my life. I think bitcoin will revolutionize banking and make governments &amp; organizations provably fair. My vote will reflect this.
-I am spending the next 2 hours not doing work I'm supposed to be doing and instead listening to an audio interview with all the candidates (  )
I hope I make the right decision when I cast my vote.

It wouldn't surprise me at all to know that most of the people penning these articles have either not read into the technology at all or otherwise have absolutely no comprehension of the technology--in which case we can all be rest assured they will be superseded soon.
(much in the same way traditional journalists have slowly been dying off in favor of marketing/PR personnel)
Also, through the many thousands of transactions I have done on bitcoin/altcoins I have never, ever received a single piece of spam or had my money "double spent"--I would be interested to know what this 'journalist' is basing their claims on (the article says some book, but in 2015 we don't usually refer to books when dealing with emerging technologies)

The same user is claiming on bitcointalk that blockchain won't answer his support queries but I have a feeling that he didn't have logging options enabled in the first place.
More importantly, blockchain will notify you via email if someone tries to log in from a strange IP and manually request via email that you verify said transaction.
I seriously do not understand why more webwallets do not require email confirmation for any account action (withdrawal especially); would solve a lot of these iffy issues.
For instance, Poloniex requires me to insert a 2FA code as well as clicking a confirmation link (which shows the address that I'm sending to and serves as a great point at which to double check the address information is 100% correct)

I disagree. Why should we have people voting who appear to not actually care enough to read an email with the subject line of
"Confirm Your Membership to Vote in Elections" (06/02/2015)
from the sender membership
This is an internet based technology. Part and parcel of being involved in technology is being able to digest information effectively.
In my opinion, if you didn't know to activate your account from the title "Confirm Your Membership to Vote in Elections" you do not deserve to vote.

Yes but suppose jewelry changes from something you store in a cupboard to something you print at home? It is not unfathomable; 3D printing could easily change the concept of jewelry.
They should be instant so consumers are actually conscious of how much electricity and water they are using. Humans haven't done a great job so far of respecting the resources which give us all of this.
If it weren't paid on a daily basis I'd at least be in favor of a weekly basis; speaking of which the blockchain would remove many of the issues associated with traditional power meters (inaccuracy, having to send someone out to read it). A properly configured home could have a power solution which instructs the fridge to reduce its temperature by 1 degree as it enters the evening (or enters/exists peak power times).
It'd also make customers 100,000x more aware of how efficient (electricity and water wise) their products are; inefficient products would certainly die off.
1 home doing it wouldn't help much, but 1,000+ homes would certainly make a measurable difference.

I think many companies that are technology based are aware that if they support the currency then thousands of people will take it as them saying "this technology here is infallible, you should use it" when in reality bitcoin is still fairly new and basically an experiment.
In the (increasingly) unlikely event bitcoin completely fails (as in a total network collapse) then companies that had backed it would be in the line of fire of customers worldwide.
There is also no easy consumer version of bitcoin yet (perhaps besides multibit); usually using bitcoin requires a multitude of accounts, wallets and so on and the documentation for a lot of this is still being updated on a day to day basis.
Also there are certain consumer provisions when it comes to software and purchases in general which means the company in some cases is legally obligated to process a refund for your purchase. This isn't currently possible with bitcoin (on top of which, do you refund the BTC value they purchased the product for or the USD value?)
I am confident that once adequate regulations exist major companies will sign on. The longer bitcoin runs (regardless of price changes) the more 'stable' it will become as a technology.

It is impossible to prove whether someone did or did not receive said email as far as I am aware.
It is a fruitless exercise to try and discuss further; I will take your word for it.
Having said that, I do believe it was clearly stated within the Bitcoin Foundation's bylaws and as such no provision should be made at this point that would go against the bylaws. It is an unfortunate incident and hopefully whoever is voted in will make an effort to improve the voting process markedly from what it is today (and also work against situations where someone with deep pockets and a programmer could sway the vote in their favor).

I play games online and didn't want my IRL information leaked online so I used PayPal (call this Account  I used this to send some friends money (who I knew only via psuedonym) as well as donate to some charitable causes (such is my right). For this account I had a psuedonym and a false address (I believe I entered "PO BOX" with no number followed by the city I was living in, it took them 2 years to figure out it wasn't real)
I moved country and discovered that I wouldn't be able to use Account  because PayPal's systems are so futuristic that you can't even change the country on your account; I created a new account "Account  (as per PayPal's own instructions) and set my new country. I verified my address, phone number and bank account.
At some stage I think I must have inadvertently logged into a previous account triggering their bullshit filter system.
I might add at this point that I had been using PayPal for several years for dozens of transactions amounting to several thousand dollars ($5000 USD+) with 0 incidents. I had purchased goods from eBay, online retailers, hosting, VPS services all without 0 incidents or complaints against myself or any of my accounts.
PayPal flagged Account  after I made a transaction for $8 USD and asked for proof of my identity; seeing as my account was already verified with a REAL BANK in a first world country, I emailed them my passport copy and a utility bill.
They eventually decided that they no longer wanted me as a customer despite there never having been a single complaint against me. I'm more than happy with this outcome, and PayPal can go suck a shit if they think I'll ever use their shitty, slow, outdated service (and when I say slow, I mean the website always takes 10 minutes just to load).
I had about $50 in the account at the time which they released to me after a 90 day waiting period. I had an eBay auction on at the time and had to ask eBay to contact the winning customer to inform them I would be regrettably unable to complete the sale due to PayPal's incompetence.
FWIW the "for life" thing comes from a phone call I had with their staff in which I asked for clarification regarding my account shutdown--she said that if PayPal ever discovered I was operating another PayPal account they would permanently disable said account. I still have another (Account  which I use sometimes when a company will not accept any payment methods besides PayPal.
I have a picture I sent to them somewhere of an ASCII police car making fun of them for thinking they're more important than an actual bank but I can't locate it right now.
TL;DR: PayPal thinks that they have a higher authority than a major bank and can shut down your accounts for any reason at any time regardless of what evidence you provide. This is also exactly the reason why Bitcoin is such fantastic technology--if I want to send friends money, donate or buy things I'll do it however the fuck I want and PayPal can keep their shit out of my business for the rest of my life (excepting circumstances where companies accept no other payment method).
@_date: 2015-02-02 20:06:54
Yes I fully understand--requiring the end user to do anything beyond clicking a few things on their computer automatically makes it worse than bitcoin.
Imagine all the other factors your visit to the bank added:
-inefficiency (you had to spent 1:1 time with a human so they could basically send an email, if that doesn't sound ridiculous I don't know what is)
-security (you presumably walked around with cash as well as let some random 3rd party who works in a bank know who you were paying and how much; even if you didn't use physical cash you still had to visit a money institution)
And regarding institution B not accepting some particular form of payment, that is the exact reason bitcoin or some other cryptocurrency will win, because it is a currency that could easily be accepted by any company/system/individual with far less limitations on who/how/when/where/why
Companies/banks/governments arbitrary placing restrictions on how/why/when/where you can spend your money and forcing you to essentially 'convert' its format are beyond ludicrous in this day and age. Given that bitcoin is new, that is to be expected, but the fact some fucking company can't work with bank transfers is ridiculous (at least that is how you worded it anyway)
If a company cannot be fucked to accept your money in 2015 I believe they should be fined by the government for wasting the earth's resources. Absolutely ridiculous that you cannot email money in this and age without the help of a human.

It is important to note that this user has failed to take adequate precautions in safeguarding their money (namely not having 2FA enabled because they said it could also be hacked).

Although it is your right to announce this to the wider world I find the amount of speculation that goes into bitcoin's price to be beyond ridiculous--almost as if people don't understand it is just the concept of supply/demand. There are evidently a lot of people who are more interested in cashing out their BTC for USD than trusting the long term viability of the currency. I think this may end up being for the better.

By double dipping I mean people have already paid 10% on bitcoin purchases so why should they have to pay again once the government wakes up and decides that cryptocurrency isn't a bad idea after all?
I would assume people would get a refund in the same way a tourist in Australia gets a refund when leaving under the TRS scheme--it is unjust for the government to charge GST and then back out and leave everyone with a 10% bill just because they decided to innovate beyond what is currently on offer.
How can the government even ask for a second round of tax on items on which GST has already been paid. That is absolutely preposterous.
There has to at least be a few people out there who have incurred thousands of dollars in GST fees for their bitcoin purchases simply because the government of Australia is inefficient and slow moving when it comes to technology.
I would be interested to hear more opinions on this (namely, that if GST is actually removed, what would the status of cryptocurrency purchased before this be in the eyes of the slow moving law?)
Also, FWIW, as far as I understand investment grade gold is tax-exempt when purchasing; so how can the government treat 'investment grade cryptocurrency' differently to heavy pieces of metal that sit in a warehouse somewhere?

I'm not on the side of BTC-E (I hadn't heard of the exchange until I read that thread) but have you even read through that thread? Pay attention to the numerous comments that point out this guy was basically asking the exchange to reveal other users identification because he didn't bother to enable 2FA. It wasn't a "THEFT" as the thread implies--the idiot didn't enable 2FA (because he didn't "trust" it) and someone placed UNAUTHORIZED TRANSACTIONS using his account. That is not THEFT--nothing actually left his account.
Any SANE company would ask for a police report/warrant before looking into it and their terms and conditions specifically spelled out that they don't care about people who don't use 2FA.
That is a terrible example to cite because the user whose account was hacked was an idiot. You should really ACTUALLY READ the thread before pasting it everywhere.
Users who refuse to take basic security precautions (such as 2FA) because they claim it could also be hacked are idiots and should not be given any attention. They only serve as a detriment to the entire community, and the sooner they learn some common sense (i.e. through the theft of their money) the better.
Now, I'm all for being sympathetic to someone whose computer is hacked in spite of their 2FA usage, I'm all for being sympathetic to someone whose computer gets compromised through malware but this guy threw caution to the wind and didn't bother with 2FA and in doing so made a 40,000 USD error.
Acting at all like this guy took reasonable precautions or that he should somehow be reimbursed or have even more time spent discussing his situation is ludicrous. No 2FA in this day and age = 40,000 USD mistake. Period. It doesn't matter which exchange. Even if it was run by the most untrustworthy people on Earth.
You may argue that unauthorized access is still theft and I will not disagree at all, but that is something for the police to investigate; as nothing actually left his account there is no way for any exchange to help him in this instance beyond providing IP addresses that accessed his account. Revealing any more information than that would compromise other users privacy and security (presumably all of those people bothered to use 2FA).

Then be a disbeliever--decentralized money on the internet has been invented and will probably take some time to be picked up or be superseded as with everything else.
The efficiency that the blockchain will provide to business (once adequate software is available) in conjunction with other technology coming online soon (drone delivery, driverless cars etc) means that barring some ridiculous regulation by governments.
The blockchain will feasibly be able to provide the world's first digital &amp; publicly accountable voting system at some stage--this will make it an evolutionary tool in humanity. It is easy to see that if such a system existed right now then citizens in some countries would push for its usage (potentially ending vote fraud).
Bitcoin is just a container really; anyone can make a coin using different or better technology and there is no restriction thus far on what people can create using it. The other interesting aspect is how Bitcoin is global, it doesn't just involve one country. It is easy to see that some great ideas/projects will emerge from other users worldwide.

My internet connection when I was a kid only supported 56kbps at maximum and I had to thread a 20 meter long phone cable through my house so I could get it in my bedroom.

My first handheld computer was a Palm M100; it came with a 16 MHz processor and 2 MB of RAM. It didn't have internet access and the only way to install applications was to shove it in a cradle.

I remember the exact day that I lost my Palm M100 at school. I went and got another as soon as another birthday/Christmas came up because just the idea of holding a computer in your hand was crazy at that point--nevermind the imperfect device, bugs or limitations that were present.

Besides which Apple has a keen habit of screwing over people with upgrades; I have no doubt they will flip some switch completely cutting off a bunch of their customers unless they upgrade their phones.

or $25 for an annual membership so you can get the chance to vote on the future of this experiment
You'd be 1 out of roughly ~3000 members, which seems an extremely small pool for a currency currently worth several billion dollars.

I don't see how the USD transaction volume or any other factor is even remotely important as long as bitcoin actually continues to function 24/7/365.
That is its sole purpose.

Mobile phone uptake in 3rd world countries has been booming for a long time now.

You're assuming it would be anonymous; if there was a way to respect people's privacy while still recording votes (based upon biometrics or similar) then it would make the system a lot fairer and more accountable than any current system.
And although people in first world countries would scoff at the concept of their biometric information appearing on the blockchain (even in encrypted form), I'm sure there are a few third-world countries where having a legitimate vote would overshadow those kind of concerns.
As far as Bill Gate's current initiatives, I can't see how he is doing anything wrong? Of course there are tons of people who will criticize regardless of what happens, but we will see what the world is like in 10-20 years time. At least he is doing a damn sight more than most governments or individuals.

I stupidly gave $100 to a cloudmining site and after only a day of mining I realized I would never, ever make back my initial investment.
I felt incredibly stupid for having invested in one at all, but to my surprise about 24 hours later they refunded the entire amount (minus about $2) claiming it was unprofitable to mine anymore.
Crisis averted.

Well that is one of the reasons for using basic security measures when using the website.
People didn't seriously think the only risk in using an underground market was the government right?

"this mystery technology that no one has been able to stop so far and has been rapidly spreading over the past few years is sure to drop in value given that 2015 is the time when dozens of companies and initiatives relating to said technology are coming online! we're sure of it!"

Except by paying 10% you've tied the purchase to the local currency value; what happens in 10 years time if the currency is worth significantly more and the government suddenly wants income tax or similar on your play money?
I have proof of bitcoin purchases from my bank account (including GST), but I fail to see why I should ever be asked for tax again when it comes to those purchases--the government asked and I gave. I see no reason at all why I should have to pay double GST, capital gains tax or any other tax now that I have paid the GST (and I like it this way, because if cryptocurrency becomes worth significantly more I will gladly produce documentation showing I have already paid GST on my play money).
I paid for a good/service (GST) and not an investment--so if my pretend money suddenly gains value it should not be counted as an investment, should it?

Because this is representative of the failings of most cryptocurrencies--why post things to a wider audience when you can have a 900+ page thread on bitcointalk that only a few people are actually going to be able to cover.
I personally believe bitcointalk and this subreddit and detrimental to the community in that the former provides an uncensored cesspit full of doggerel and scams (and the odd diamond) while the latter promotes hivemind attitudes--posts on here do not seem representative of what is actually happen and only reflect certain news stories.
Cryptocurrency is a 21st century technology and it needs a 21st century solution for communication. Hivemind websites (reddit in my opinion) and archaic forum software do not help us to communicate effectively.

Not only that I pointed out to the user that the BTC-E terms &amp; conditions specifically state that they won't look into unauthorized account incidents when the user has not enabled 2FA (  ).
They seem to think that account security is solely the responsibility of their exchange which is preposterous. It is also alarming that users are learning about bitcoin without learning about basic computer security at the same time.
They also seem to think the exchange should release information about other people's accounts to them without a court/police order. So this could theoretically be someone who thinks they could manipulate the exchange into revealing the private details of other users--unlikely, but still theoretically possible.

Who in 2015 does not have an active email account they can provide to people and not have to update their services? Not many people. I have used the same private email address for my personal and business correspondence for more than 10 years.
I signed up. I paid $25. I got an email with the subject line of "Confirm Your Membership to Vote in Elections" from the bitcoin foundation and I took the time to act upon it.
I receive emails from hosting providers when my invoices are due; if I don't act upon them my services get disconnected.
I receive emails from people who want to hire me; if I don't act upon them I don't get work.
It stands to reason that if someone (whether an individual or candidate) receives an email stating "Confirm Your Membership to Vote in Elections" from the Bitcoin foundation that they should act upon said email.
If you failed to act from that email alone or were incapable or receiving it because you need to suddenly update your email address in 2015 I do not think you should be a part of the voting process.
I fail to see what other communication method the foundation should have used (perhaps next time if they send a bouquet of flowers and some chocolates to people's doorsteps they would take more notice).

I signed up because I was interested in having some say. I got an email and read on several forums that I needed to activate my account to be considered for voting.
"As per our bylaws, members who wish to participate in voting need to confirm their status as active members."
I did so. Now I get to vote.

It will the moment we start seeing affordable, reliable biometric devices (which currently don't exist). There isn't even a go-to fingerprint scanner manufacturer on the market.
A lot of high end smartphones include a fingerprint scanner as standard.
