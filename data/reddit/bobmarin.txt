this was due to the halving that was going on for Dogecoin, BTC and DOGE should sync-up in the short term.

There is already a lot of discussion on how this should be managed and I can tell you now that the system is going to be as farthest from decentralized as possible...
The most discussed about proposal is that every time somebody uses a SAFE app ( GETs the data dir) it adds to the counter of the aforementioned app. So that the app that gets used the most also gets the biggest distribution of the 10%.
@_date: 2014-06-02 04:43:15
No it's not.
where did you read that?
@_date: 2014-01-25 18:54:05
Great article! 
What do you think will be the first app that gets widespread use from Mastercoin?
@_date: 2014-02-06 22:56:41
Are we going to be able to see the entire episode?
Because if you post this on youtube it could be very instructional to newcomers to Bitcoin and could drive a lot of traffic to your service.
I for one would definitely sign up if you would offer payments in Bitcoin and if I see your show on youtube promoting the Bitcoin revolution.
The trailer looks interesting I see you got all the bigwigs (where is Andreas?).

Testnet 2 is just around the corner, where you will be able to connect your computer to the SAFE network with a one click installer. There will be a couple of example apps like SAFE chat and LifeStuff (dropbox replacement) and possibly some things I'm not aware of...

I think you receive down votes no matter what so don't worry.
Great initiative Bruce, I signed it even though I'm not form the US.

Not only is there a huge amount of code on their [github page]( but the repo is incredibly active.
And if you try to dig deeper you'll find a trove of information on this project. For instance David Irvine (the founder) gave a talk about project SAFE at [Google](
There are also [patents]( filed in as early as 2006. to prove that this is not an ad hoc project. Also if you checkout the references and citations you'll see that this work has been referenced by researchers from Qualcomm, Panasonic and others...
And if you are still not sure you can go to [maidsafe.org]( and David and most of the devs yourself...
@_date: 2014-06-02 02:50:33
Well as I mentioned earlier there is a whole bunch of [patents]( filed that are  each being referenced by respectable researchers. The only thing you need  to do is go through them all.
I understand the desire for simple explanations but the biggest breakthroughs are not simple to begin with.
And besides there is going to be a testnet in a week or two so that we can all be reassured that this actually works
@_date: 2014-06-02 02:36:47
This is pure FUD.
MaidSafe is not run by an ex-skype executive. Micheal Jackson (ex-Skype COO) has joined the MaidSafe Foundation's board a couple of days ago and I'm sure he is going to move this project forward with the experience that he gathered at Skype. 
Also he is a partner at a VC firm Mangrove capital and having some VC muscle to back projects that are mad for the SAFEnet is going to be crucial to kickstart real adoption.
If you are questioning his motives at least read his [guest post]( at coindesk in which he is clearly condemning the regulatory path that Bitcoin seems to be on. Reading his articles on coindesk I would put him in the same basket as Marc Andreasson or Fred Wilson

Tor uses onion routing which basically means that it sends A LOT of links to hide where you want to go and vice versa.
SAFE is organized like Bittorrent in that it is completely decentrilized, distributed and very very fast (at least that is what the simulations are predicting)
so the lazy answer is that the difference is speed but there really is so much more.
For instance just the Safecoin aspect brings this idea so much forward because you have incentives for the users of the network to propagate it. The big failure of projects like Usenet was that users of the network didn't really pay much attention to having more people join them. 
And besides if Bitcoin is anything to go by SAFE is going to have a better infrastructure and performance in no time.

such an empty comment and an even worse article.
I very much like what you guys at Nakamoto Institute are doing with categorizing the work of Satoshi but to be honest you guys are also a tad bit too cunty for my taste.
The constant bickering coming from this Daniel Krawizs dude is really off-putting. Not to mention that there is often no logic behind his statements even though he presents them as the pinnacle of deep thought and vast experience... how old is he again? 19yo? 
To conclude that all appcoins are fraudulent and shouldn't even bother innovating on Satoshi's idea is juvenile at best

Great article!
I have to say that I almost completely agree with you, except for one thing.
As you I'm also of the opinion that Bitcoin's blockchain should not be used to build other apps on it (such as MaidSafe), other apps should use their own blockchain because that makes the technology that more resilient (or anti-fragile).
What I tried to say with my comment on incorporating MaidSafe with the Ethereum technology and ecosystem, is that by cross-linking the different blockchains we will get a lot more cross-pollination and in general an easier system to use.
The good thing about Ethereum (at least how it's planned) is that you can choose your own involvement in the system; you can have your own blockchain that you only "connect" to Ethereum so that it can "read" MaidSafe's blockchain and in return MaidSafe can use the many Distributed Apps that will be devoloped on their platform(distributed exchange, turing complete contracts etc), also MaidSafe will have access to 
Ethereum's ecosystem: miners, users, developers.
From a users perspective he/she wouldn't even know that they are using two (eventually a lot more) blockchains and that is definitely something that all of us in this space have to strive for because users want the UX to be simple otherwise they simply will not use it, it's on us to design the system to be highly decentralized and distributed but also very simple to use.
And before I forget you should definitely take a look at the OpenLibrenet project, they seem to have the whole theory of an incentivized Meshnet in check. I just have a feeling that the more synergistic these systems play of each other the faster the growth faze will play out.
P.S. I am going to watch the MaidSafe project closely and will definitely try to help in any way I can because not only is this something I want to use but also because the growth faze will be extremely interesting to watch.

They will enter the market where liquidity is low (emerging markets) which will have huge positive effects on the emerging markets since liquidity begets liquidity.
What you are saying is such short term thinking that it's basically a non-existent thought. 
@_date: 2014-06-02 08:11:00
snap sonnnnn
@_date: 2014-07-02 13:31:44
This times a thousand times.
It's hard providing liquidity in EM's and this is where it's needed most. This is practically a one stop solution for the near term future.
Plus liquidity begets liquidity

You do realize that over 2000 people contributed more then $6 million?
Projects like Usenet and Freenet didn't have a financial incentive to spread the network. Not only did they not work to spread the network they even enjoyed the exclusiveness somewhat, and besides who needs those noobz asking them questions.
Safenet on the other hand has Safecoin. So not only can users use Safecoin to fund the projects that they want to see but the more people use the network the bigger the value of the coin.
It's the Bitcoin feedback loop on steroids
@_date: 2014-06-02 03:31:02
Then join the project...
It's a very much open project when it comes to devs. You can just fork the code and start working on it (with the help of maidsafe devs of course)
The cool thing about SAFE is that 10% of all issued Safecoins are going to be payed out to devs working on open source projects or the SAFEnet code itself.
Also not to forget to mention: Instead of proof of work where you have to spend computing power and electricity to solve meaningless math, MaidSafe uses a proof of resource scheme where you are rewarded with Safecoins only if you provide storage to the SAFE network (and that storage is actually being used)
And that is just the begining, this can be applied to computing (think folding but you are actually earning money), meshnetworking and some other examples that are even crazier... 
@_date: 2014-06-02 03:49:46
Even though the crowdfunding effort was run on Master Protocol the SAFE project will not use Master Protocol in any way after the project is launched.
Mastercoins were basically just used as colored coins so that there are some checks and balances to be able to distribute Safecoins to their rightfull owners (the people who invested the initial $6 million) when the network is launched.

How is it vaporware if it's open sourced and can already be installed locally?
If you mean that the network still hasn't been launched then you have a point but that should also be proven wrong next week because they are putting the last touches on their final dev sprint before SAFE network is officially launched sometime next week.
Here is their [jira dashboard]( where you can see that they are 95% done with their current dev sprint.
With regards to the cryptography system you are partially right (partially; because the principles of a shared ledger are kept but since the network itself is different the technology keeping the ledger up to date is also different) but there is absolutely no reason why current blockchain tech couldn't be used for Safecoin if the new technology fails for some reason. Naturally the whole thing should be approached with heavy caution as you say.
