Welcome to Chinacoin. Get used to it. It's the new bitcoin. Run by secretive 
centralized authoritarians.
@_date: 2017-03-22 01:19:42
Chinacoin will never work.  The free world will never adopt as its primary digital currency one that is centrally controlled by a Chinese cartel that could be undermined at any time by a corrupt deceitful government. 
Remember, this is a nation that has institutionalized theft, murder and deceit into state policy.  Chinese moral hazard will kill any attempt at a BU Chinacoin.

He should be able to see that turning bitcoin into a Chinacoin is pernicious to digital currency in general since western financial institutions will never ever use a digital currency that is tainted by the moral hazard of China and the Chinese.

Try to imagine the scenario Ver is buying into-- the free world accepting a digital currency centrally controlled by a Chinese cartel that could be undermined at any time by a corrupt deceitful government. 
I hope the man buys the new Chinacoin with his BTC sales proceeds. Financial ruin will hasten his departure from the scene.

A hack of Bitcoin could be done profitably by secretly double spending unspent outputs multiple times much like MtGox unknowingly lost coins due to the malleability bug which allowed the same transaction to be validated twice if it had minor variations in its script.

Let this be a lesson that the Chinese and the Bitcoin business model are incompatible. The Chinese simply do not have the empathy for people unlike themselves to participate in enterprises requiring honor and good faith for its workings. This should be evident when one observes how they have legalized theft of intellectual property from foreigners into their government institutions.  The inherent moral hazard of the Chinese can be indemnified in trade by bonds and legal covenants which is how the world trade survives their perfidy. But any enterprise that requires of them unselfish goodwill will not survive.

I've had assets on Coinbase for 4 years and never sold any.
There's one reason.

Always buy in the morning and sell in the afternoon.

It would be helpful to have a glossary of Bitcoin abbreviations.

If you have to get advice from reddit on whether bitcoin is a good investment you don't understand it enough to be investing alot. You're asking us if you should buy a lottery ticket.  I can tell you that the bitcoin technology will change the world because it is the first human invention that automates trust but you don't have enough confidence in what i'm saying to invest because you don't understand mathematically how it works or how it will affect current business practices. You just rely on how smart the people seem who are telling you its great or its a scam. I have made enough from bitcoin to buy a house but I have never told friends or relatives to invest because I believe you have to deeply feel the elegance of the whole proof-of-work confirmation process as an organic expression of mankind before you commit to it.

All the MtGox customers holding cash at the time of bankruptcy will get all their money back. This is due to the rise in the price of bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-19 17:09:07
The percentage of bitcoin in my portfolio keeps changing as the price rises.  A few years ago I put 5% of my net worth into an exchange called MtGox and then another 5% into another exchange when MtGox died. It all worked out pretty well considering since my bitcoin holdings have grown to about 40% of my portfolio. I'm even making a profit off the MtGox bankruptcy.

Good analysis. Need more info on how to call the bottom.
@_date: 2018-04-05 00:20:53
That was the worst thing you could have done. I bought all the bitcoin I could at $200-$300 on the last trading day beleiving that there was no possible way that an exchange could have lost ALL its assetts. It turns out I was right it. It only lost 80%. So my bankruptcy claim for those coins I bought from ColdBlockWallet are now worth 20% X $7000 = $1400 each for a 500% profit.

Bitcoin is too important to be allowed to wither away under a government ban to satisfy anarchist puritanism that guarantees its use by marginal players like silk road and wikileaks.
With bitcoin seen as being complicit in the killing of babies in hospitals a hard forked new coin is inevitable.

Could be that the competing currencies, Litecoin, BCH, etc. pulled some of the mundane transaction volume away so that Bitcoin positions could be maintained without hasseles.

The electrumpro executives and developers are swedish. There's is almost zero chance of swedes engaging in this kind of fraud. 
Is their swedish persona just a front run by east european scammers? Could be. Check out the identites of the company personel before shitting on the company.

It won't be long until there are demands from the public to embargo criminal bitcoin addresses. The bitcoin tech community should start working on a system that would allow miners to ignore blacklisted addresses in mempool so they never appear in blocks.

As Mt Gox victim I often wonder how many other victims of fraud gave up on Bitcoin and how many, like my self, immediately replaced their lost coins with new ones.

Aww. Wish there was a Taco sign.

Those 5 bitcoins are now worth about $2400. I hope you put in a claim to the bankruptcy.
