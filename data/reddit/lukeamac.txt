Take me to pleasure town big daddy. Oh we're going there.

In what world are Litecoins not usable? There is far more real world B2C use cases for LTC than there is for XRP.

What country are you in for a start? Not all tax laws are the same?
@_date: 2017-08-14 02:04:46
Could be spot on too.

Cool story bro. Try googling "what's a decentrilised ledger" and have a read. Then Google "XRP whitepaper" have a read of that too.

Dumbest thing I've ever heard 
@_date: 2017-08-27 19:29:16
Try litecoin, IOTA.

Tell him I said thanks for buying my bag

Don't engage the oxygen thief any engagement. Not worthy.

Less than 0.001% chance this is a woman IMO.
@_date: 2017-09-16 23:20:01
Someone also sold $10 mil with at $3620....
@_date: 2017-09-13 12:01:41
*One obviously lol
@_date: 2017-09-12 12:03:04
Not that, it's more so that we're at around 3% women ownership currently so back then so much smaller and then combined with the higher risk profile I have it exceptional small % of it being a woman.

Congrats friend. Managed to take my stack from 2.6 BTC to 5 during the dip. Now we HODL!
@_date: 2017-09-12 06:27:22
Amazing foresight, well done to you, you deserve everything it brings to you. I'm a latecomer to the space and own only 5 BTC and an alt coin portfolio worth about 20 BTC. Fair play to you man, congrats.

I should say ~$100 is an arbitrary number, that's worse case. But at any point can we go back to where we once were?
@_date: 2017-07-15 12:36:55
Some aren't smart enough to understand all the scenarios, not necessarily lazy.
@_date: 2017-07-15 22:25:41
Regardless of your views, like I don't even fully understand all the options, so not going to say which is better etc. Question is, put simply; what ever happens, can we go back if we wanted to?
@_date: 2017-07-17 03:33:50
@_date: 2017-07-13 22:32:44
They most certainly are not efficient.
@_date: 2017-07-15 22:00:39
Regardless of what we get the question remains; if the community realises it's a big mistake can it be rolled back essentially?
@_date: 2017-07-16 02:17:07
In layman's terms?
@_date: 2017-07-16 02:30:46
Hectic, thanks for that
@_date: 2017-07-12 21:24:34
As an Australian I'm shocked
@_date: 2017-07-18 03:39:48
I some what agree but eventually we want those "idiots" to use BTC no? Being hostile about it doesn't leave a good taste in their mouth.
They tell 10 people about bad experience/ community, who tell 10 more people each, etc.
@_date: 2017-07-18 02:50:51
Not a helpful response in terms of helping to grow the community. However a very factual one.
@_date: 2017-06-24 23:04:21
Fuckin lol
