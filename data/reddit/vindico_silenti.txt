Well to be fair korea WAS the big FUD source. Market will take some time to digest it but this should alleviate the downward pressure.

Okay everyone, you know what to do. Lets meme our way out of this.

PSA: S. Korea regulatory announcement is GOOD news

If core came out and said lets do a 2x increase, it would happen. Only reason it failed is because they rallied people against it.

I get that people aren't deploying segwit on purpose.. The problem is nobody can force them to, so it has the intended effect of crippling btc

From what I keep reading, big blocks are a risk eventually, but only when their size meaningfully restricts who can run a node. I'm just curious if the NO2x group actually hated the block size increase, or just how it was being pushed on us (I'm in the second camp). I personally am all for a Core-sponsored 2-8mb increase as a quick fix.

Seems that way. Segwit adoption being stalled at 8% is very strange to me. I don't understand why exchanges claiming to be "agnostic" in the debate don't use it.

Normally this would be true, but not addressing this small fixable issues opens us up unnecessarily to attacks from a "ahem"... certain fork.

Ideally both...

Relatively reasonable until the $10 BTC price prediction haha

maybe a little one, tbh we just need to get past tax season

Yes, its definitely a factor. Combine that with the Mt Gox liquidations and there's the culprit.
