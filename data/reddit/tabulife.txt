Bye. 
You are a socialist. You think that just because you don’t have any bitcoin and others do that we should put it all in a big pot and everyone should get an equal share (including you who have done nothing to deserve it)
I am a late “early adopter” having made my first investment in Jan. 2016. I took on a second job for the sole purpose of making some extra money that I could then invest in bitcoin. I have worked 70-80 a week for nearly 2 years to be able to afford to buy little bits and pieces since then. I believe whole heartedly in Bitcoin and what the future possibilities are. 
So, while you sat at home smoking weed and playing Xbox, I was busting my ass over the last couple of years to EARN what little I have. 
Let me help you out with a little “real world” advice ... you are not entitled to anything. The world owes you nothing. If you want to secure your financial future, work hard and invest wisely. 
If that’s not important to you, keep smoking weed and playing Xbox but the bottom line is that you aren’t getting any of the Bitcoin that I have because I worked for them and all you want to do is bitch. 
So says the 50 year old man who writes this. 
Bitcoin is not only for the young but also the young of heart and mind.

So says the futures trader ...
To enhance market liquidity ...
The single most important feature of Bitcoin ( outside of decentralization) is its’ limited supply. Cash settled Bitcoin futures are allowing speculation into the Bitcoin market without ever having to touch the underlying asset. While that theoretically increases liquidity, it has the ability to affect the value of the underlying asset ( in this case, Bitcoin) there are many people heavily invested in gold who firmly believe it is the gold futures “speculation” that keeps the value of an ounce of physical gold substantially depressed. 
Cash settled futures, across the board, are nothing more or less than speculation but your definition of “increasing liquidity, reducing fees and reducing volatility “ is a nice marketing slogan to justify why those futures exist at all.

** PSA ... do your own research, learn as much as you can about Bitcoin and then make informed decisions that are the correct ones for your individual circumstance. Reading uninformed/misinformed blowhards on Reddit does NOT qualify as research!!!
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:05:34
You are a misinformed idiot. 
The statistic of 3% owning 95% does NOT take into account that the exchanges (Coinbase, Gemini, bitflyer, Bithumb, kraken and ALL the others) keep their thousands/millions of customers bitcoins in wallets that are part of that 3% you quote. 
The majority of people who own bitcoin leave them on the exchange where they purchased them. If Coinbase has a million bitcoins under its custody and control on behalf of their customers and keep them in wallets ... those wallets have a million bitcoin in them and are part of the 3% you quote but those coins belong to the Coinbase customers (millions of customers) not the wallet holder (Coinbase)
Think of it as a traditional bank. 
You deposit $100. 
9 other people deposit $100 each. 
The bank puts that in a vault. 
You say that vault owns $1000 when in reality 10 people own $100 each. 
That 3% is a bullshit number that gets tossed around by people like you who have no idea what they are raging against.

Satoshi Nakamoto is a pseudonym.  
There is no one who knows for sure who Satoshi truly is. It may be 1 person or it may very well have been a group of people who envisioned bitcoin. 
At the end of the day, it doesn’t really matter who Satoshi is. 
The bitcoin that “Satoshi” owns are watched by hundreds (if not thousands) of people. They, like all bitcoin can be traced on the blockchain and those coins have NEVER moved. 
Why? 
No one knows for sure but their are all sorts of theories. 
The idea that Satoshi would return and destroy that which he/she/they created makes no sense.

Nobody except for the remaining members of the SEC and anyone they have leaked information to, has any real idea what is going to happen, let alone put a percentage on it.

Absolutely. Each time an "event" happens in China, the less of an impact on the market. I also believe that this can also ease at least one of the concerns that the SEC may have relating to the applications for ETFs. A lot of misinformed articles are written stating that the Chinese basically control Bitcoin because of trading volume .. blah blah blah. The SEC may actually believe that as well. With events like this most recent one having marginal impact on the market, when most believed it would have a great impact, shows that the market moves on with or without the Chinese.

@_date: 2017-03-06 00:18:57
Any large investor that had a desire to short Bitcoin would already be doing it. The ETF does nothing to change that. Institutional investors are very unlikely to short the ETF because the historic volatility of the underlying asset makes it a very risky proposition. Further, institutional investors will also realize that with the ETF only adjusting value at the end of each day that "catching" $30-$50 swings needs to be done in real time. The institutional money that people keep referring to is brokers and money managers who will advise clients to invest in the ETF as a potential high risk, high reward investment which would likely comprise a very small percentage of a much larger, diversified portfolio. 
Bottom line is, it makes little to no sense to short the ETF in an attempt to manipulate the market when it is much easier to accomplish that goal by dealing with Bitcoin directly. 
@_date: 2017-03-10 18:59:49
You sir are a moron. I watched it happen in real time and formed a valid opinion based on what I saw. I assure you I have a very good understanding of the market and economics. It takes a couple hundred Bitcoin, with appropriate timing and so many stop buy orders in play to do what happened this morning. Then catch the stop loss orders on the way down. Please research some of the market terms I used and then maybe you will have a clue as to what really happened. 
If you have a different opinion vs. just shitting on mine, post it!!!

@_date: 2017-03-09 13:19:36
Come on guys. Common sense says that the decision has been made. In fact it is likely the decision was made long ago and the rest of the delay is administrative maneuvering. It is highly likely that at the February meeting the conditions were set forth by the SEC to approve the ETF and that the Winklevii just had to satisfy those conditions, which I am sure they have at this late date. The only question in my mind is does the SEC outright approve the rule change or let it happen by default. 
There is 0% chance at this point it gets rejected. 
Bank on it!!!
@_date: 2017-03-10 19:57:09
In other words you have no opinion. 
Your entire "thesis" is " that's what markets do" 
You have no idea what you are talking about. 
Under the conditions of this morning, a couple hundred bitcoins MOVED this market by $150 in 5 minutes and it was almost all automatic as pre-existing stop buy orders were executed. While my assumption that it was intentionally done could be wrong (although not likely) the rest of the movement was exactly what I explained. In fact if you read the comments on this thread you will see at least a couple people who got caught or know someone who did. 
@_date: 2017-03-03 13:56:14
It is commonplace for the SEC to give notice in advance that a proposed rule change or other filing is doomed. It gives the petitioner time to withdraw the request in its current form and not get a big, red, "REJECTED" stamped across the top of it. Rejected means "no" but a withdraw allows the petitioner to make changes and re-file plus they get to save face. 
This is done as a matter of common practice and in almost every case is not insider trading because it has no bearing on the value of the underlying asset class. I agree that Bitcoin is different in that regard but I'm confident that the SEC would extend the same courtesy to the twins if they planned to reject this.

SEC doesn't care about the GBTC or the price of Bitcoin. The will announce on their schedule, if they choose to announce at all. They may just post a decision or do nothing at all. If they do nothing then the rule change is approved but there will likely be no immediate documentation to reflect that. More likely if they don't post a decision, there will be some paperwork to follow stating that it was passed based on no action being taken subject to rule ... blah blah blah. That could take weeks to draft and post. 
I am betting on no decision and nothing to reflect that posted even on Monday. 
It will leave everyone scrambling and the so called " experts" rendering their opinions as to what is next. 
Bitcoin is a different animal and not making a decision allowing a rule to pass by default has not happened before so no-one really knows what to expect if that comes to pass

Happened to me. I lost 12 Bitcoin trying to time the market with what they call "weak hands" the best advise I can give ( and I am talking to myself as well) is to determine why you are investing in cryptocurrency. If it because you believe it is the future and then buy and hodl. Ride the roller coaster armed with the firm belief that you will be sitting pretty in the end. 
If you are investing with money that you may need for other reasons in the short term then maybe the crypto space is not where you should be. 
I am happy with the huge gains that I have seen but I can't help but look back and multiply current price x the 12 Bitcoin I lost trying to time the market. 
At the end of the day, my 1st Bitcoin purchase was 1/1/2016 and I have dollar cost averaged since then and my holdings today are worth over 5x my capital investment even with the loss of 12 Bitcoin. 
Not much to complain about.

I agree with all that you just said. Further, I am a hodler for sure and can’t, at this stage, imagine spending my Bitcoin on anything that I don’t firmly believe will appreciate in value at the same rate, or faster, than I believe bitcoin will (which excludes almost everything) However, if I live to see the true maturation of Bitcoin then I believe the value will have stabilized greatly. Then I can imagine using it as a true currency for daily living, etc ... As it will generally be replaceable for work or other goods and services in the same value range. 
When considering things like micro transactions for reading an article online or listening to a song that happens seemlessly from computer to computer in the future, (assuming stable bitcoin value) spending 5 satoshi to read that article becomes less problematic for me because I will have the ability to publish my own article ( for example) and earn that 5 satoshi because someone else decides to pay the 5 satoshi to read my ramblings. 
Until then ... I Hodl !!

Most of the volume of BCH is on Bithumb. It is a Korean exchange that has zero fee trading. If you want to pump the price (and they are) you simply wash trade (sell to yourself) continually increasing the price. 
It costs you nothing to do that as there are no trading fees involved. 
24 hour volume in Bithumb is over 1 million BCH ... next closest is Bitfinex at 179k.

Unfortunately you, like many others, see the price move up and down and your mind says “ I knew that was going to happen” and you start trading. Then reality sets in and you realize that you have no idea what the market will do. 
The price goes up and you think that it will continue and you will wait for the top to sell but then it starts dropping. You say to yourself “ this is just  a small correction, I’m not weak, I will ride this out” ... it keeps dropping and that lump appears in your throat and you start thinking “is this the big crash??”  Then you say I better get out before there is nothing left so you sell at a loss.

So then why do you use Coinbase?
There are other options. I am not a Coinbase fan but they are a “ for profit “ business that can Taylor their business model in whatever way they feel will best Benefit themselves if they make bad decisions and their fees are too high then people can choose not to use them which will then get them to reconsider their structure. 
I do agree that it would be nice for them to give you the ability to set your own fee depending on the priority of the transaction.   My guess is they also take a slice of the transaction fee which is why they don’t.

Your assertion that it will take me a year to double my money is stupid and VERY easily disproven. 
Bitcoin price:
Jan. 1, 2017 ...  $998

2 reasons for congestion at times that make it artificial. 
1. Miners switching to mine Bitcoin Cash when it is more profitable to do so. It becomes more profitable when the difficulty adjustment kicks in and allows blocks to be mined at a ridiculous “ inflation creating” pace. With each block mined, there is still a reward for the miner in the form of new coins. It is easy to see my point. Simply look at how many bitcoins are in circulation and how many BCH is in circulation(many more). This means that the 21 million cap on BCH will be reached faster and no new coins will be available and no miner will mine that substantially less profitable coin if all they get are transaction fees. It will die a quick painful death. They , Roger Ver and Jihan Wu will try and keep it alive by hard forking it several times, the last of which will increase the maximum number of coins which then just make it an inflationary altcoin. 
2, some of the bad actors who signed the NYA have been spamming the bitcoin network with transactions with zero fees. This was/is being done so that they artificially cause a slowdown thus causing fees to rise. They also mine empty blocks at times. Again for the same reason. It is all done to simply cause the average bitcoin user who doesn’t know what goes on behind the scenes to think tha bitcoin is unusable because it is slow and expensive. 
S2x is not about an increase in block size (Bitcoin Cash has 8 mb blocks but slows to a crawl when the difficulty goes back to normal) because miners abandon it for more profitable bitcoin mining.  It is not an “upgrade” as it is running old code with known bugs and provides no replay protection. 
What it is, is a blatant hostile takeover by corporate interests. If it were to succeed they signers if the NYA can continue to mold  Bitcoin in the way that is most profitable for them without any consideration for the original vision, the ecosystem or most importantly, the end user ... you!!!

Go to the Ledger site and read about it or google Ledger 2nd confirmation. 
The 2nd transaction is your change being returned to your wallet. 
Think of it as paying for a $2 item with a $10 bill. The 1st transaction is the $2 and the 2nd transaction is your $8 change. 
If you update to the latest firmware and bitcoin wallet app, it will “fix” the issue (which is not really an issue) and you will no longer need to confirm the 2nd transaction.

Coinbase is not “giving” you anything. If you own any bitcoin pre-fork you WILL get the exact amount if Shit2x coins. The safest way is to move your coins to a hardware wallet and control your private keys. 
If you don’t have your private keys you don’t have true control of your Bitcoin and will always be at the mercy of the exchange. 
Buy a trezor or ledger Nano S and keep your coins safe, under your control and you will still receive an equal amount of Shit2x coins.

That is to be expected at some point in the future if Bitcoin were to become a reserve or world currency but that is not inflation. If you divide a bitcoin into a quadrillion parts but the supply of Bitcoin is fixed at 21 million then 1 bitcoin = 1/21,000,000 of all bitcoin. 
To better understand ... if you have 1 US dollar in your pocket and it’s currently divisible into 100 pennies and then the government decides to create half pennies. The dollar in your pocket is no less valuable because it is now worth 200 half pennies. 
But ... when the government arbitrarily prints more dollars, that’s when our dollar is devalued ... INFLATION!!!

Think about it. A mature investor who chooses to “short” bitcoin on margin will only do so because they “know” the price is going to dip. 
How can they “know” this???
They can only “know” it if they have enough bitcoin to dump on the market to drive the price down. They can only have enough bitcoin if they buy it in the first place (likely driving the price up) ... and once they sell the coin to manipulate the price down, they have to buy it back to do it again. 
IMHO no reasonable investor will short bitcoin on a hunch. It is a very resilient asset that is up 700% this year alone. If you just short bitcoin on the hope that it will go down, you will likely be one very unhappy, broke person in no time. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 19:24:52
Quite simply ... bigger blocks are NOT a long term scaling solution. Off chain transactions with on chain settlement is the only way to scale bitcoin and have it be used as a currency. This also addresses transaction speed and cost.

Remember that what keeps bitcoin decentralized is that all the nodes keep a copy of the ledger and validate the transactions in the blocks. If blocks become 100mb, imagine the time it will take for each node to download 100mb to validate the transactions. 
The only way to scale and for bitcoin to become usable as a means of payment are for those payments to be handled off-chain and then bundled and then settled on-chain using something like Lightning networks that is already in development.

What these traditional "Big Bankers" fail to realize (or maybe they realize but continue to repeat the same crap because it serves their interests) is that public digital currencies "lack of a controlling arm" is one of the primary reasons for their very existence. It is NOT a flaw, rather it is a primary advantage over the current worldwide financial system. 
A "controlling arm" is that which haphazardly prints more fiat thus causing inflation and devaluing that which you already hold. A"controlling arm" is that which commits fraud and causes the housing crisis and throws the world economy into a huge recession.

Assuming your story is real (sorry but a lot of fake stories out there) my advice to you is to take what little time you have and educate yourself. IMHO seeking a tutor to walk you through the process opens you up to some unscrupulous characters who may take advantage of lack of knowledge (and time). If someone walks you through the process of buying and storing Bitcoin, they will likely have access to your coins and when you least expect it ... poof ... they’re gone. Once your coins are gone, they are gone. 
There is a ton of condensed information available to put you in a position to safely buy and store your coins safely without relying on the honesty of a stranger. 
Search the threads and you will find bunches of info on setting up an account on a trusted exchange where you can purchase bitcoin and depending on the level of investment you may want to purchase a trezor or nano S hardware wallet which is one of the safest ways of storing your Bitcoin. 
Good luck but again, be Leary if strangers offering to help you ... they may have an ulterior motive.

It doesn't matter what I think. I believe in Bitcoin, cryptocurrency in general and what it represents. The value of Bitcoin should not be compared to the USD or any other government manipulated, deflating fiat currency. 
It is quite possible that a single Bitcoin could be worth in excess of $1 million dollars ... but ... what will a million dollars buy you at that time? A loaf of bread ... maybe?
You miss the whole point of the Bitcoin experiment...

I see things a little differently. While I don't believe this is solely about cryptocurrency, it may very well give the SEC the framework in place to be able to justify approving some Bitcoin related products such as the ETF's that are still on the SEC's agenda at the moment. 
Chairman Clayton has been reported to be crypto friendly so with "watchdogs" in place at the SEC it makes it far easier to justify approving the Bitcoin products. 
If that happens then the real institutional money will fly into Bitcoin and you may want to buckle up cause we could be headed to the moon.

Check the premise of the original thread. It was a guy with $57 dollars hoping that the rumor of a Swiss crackdown was going to cause a dip so he "could buy low"
It was not about the bigger picture. I took a jab at him because it was an irritating comment from someone hoping to profit from further FUD. You decided to school me and call me out as a NOOB when you know nothing about me. 
My comment in response to his thread was appropriate and on point. The market will in no way react to any regulation from Switzerland based on
1. Literally no volume traded in Swiss Franc
2. Based on your premise that this would be detrimental to the Eco system and the bigger picture. 
The daily value of Bitcoin in USD is based on Trading. It requires buyers and sellers and at least for the time being they are almost all trying to profit from the volatility and in many cases without any concern about the "bigger picture "
I, conversely, have a reasonable stake in various cryptocurrency and do see and believe in the "bigger picture" more from a political standpoint than a technological standpoint primarily because I am not a tech. guy. 
However, with that said, you jumped in and replied to my comment on a thread that was clearly a hopeful comment from an uninformed person with no real stake in the community hoping to double his $57 on a dip based on FUD so he could buy a new bong. 
Clearly you are a tech guy living in Switzerland and provided you are not part of the problem in trying to attack Bitcoin and centralize it , I thank you for your efforts. If you are one of those trying to attack Bitcoin, I hope you fail and fail miserably.

So if it was simply JP Morgan customers purchasing the product for themselves using" JP Morgan pipes" doesn't that mean that the customers are better informed and smarter than the the JP Morgan traders?
If the CEO of the financial firm that handles my investments firmly states that a particular investment is a fraud and likens it to the tulip bulb bubble and I felt strongly enough that he was wrong and I was willing to put my own money behind it, I would seriously need to question who is handling my investments moving forward.

Why yes I have heard of Crypto Valley and I also know that it is located in Switzerland. 
I also KNOW that the Swiss Franc does not make the list of the top 15 "currencies" by volume for acquiring Bitcoin.   is the Malaysian Ringgit and comprises .06% of Bitcoin volume which means the Swiss Franc comprises less than that. 
To be clear, that number is .06% ... NOT ... 6% ... In Case you don't understand decimals, that is 6/10ths of 1% (almost half a percent if fractions aren't your thing either)
So, that is for the Malaysian Ringgit and the Swiss Franc didn't make the list. 
So, Crypto Valley being located in Switzerland is wonderful, it is a newly formed "association" and is just getting is legs under it so I'm not sure what that has to do with "Switzerland" regulating Bitcoin and banning ICO's and its bearing on Bitcoin price as was the premise of the original post.

@_date: 2017-10-09 15:18:44
First of all ... Who are the people telling you to sell your Altcoins???
People on Reddit??? You do realize that there is no barrier to be able to participate on Reddit which means the people offering you financial advice could be a 10 year old that still puts their allowance in a piggy bank for safekeeping. 
Next there are soooo many altcoins (between 800-1000 at last check) that you would need to be more specific on which you hold and your price of entry for even the most educated investor to offer you advice. Even then, it is truly an educated GUESS for anyone to predict what the cryptocurrency market will do. 
My best guess as to what and why you are being told to dump your altcoins and buy Bitcoin is because if 2 events in the next 45 days or so. 
1. Bitcoin gold later this month. For every Bitcoin or fraction that you own, you will get an equivalent amount of the new "Bitcoin gold" token. It may be worthless but better to have a bunch of them worth $0 than to have none of them and have them worth something some day. 
2. S2x hardfork in November. In layman's terms, you will also get the equivalent amount of S2x tokens for every Bitcoin that you own at the time of the fork. 
Conventional wisdom says that many investors will be selling their altcoins and purchasing Bitcoin in preparation for these 2 events. If that happens, the avg. price of the various altcoins will go down with a flood if selling and conversely the price of Bitcoin will rise because there is a flurry of buying. 
So, in summary, with the 2 events outlined above, you will end up with a total of 3 coins for every Bitcoin you own. 
Bitcoin Gold
And ... in anticipation of that, investor money leaves altcoins in the short term, lowering their value and flocks back to Bitcoin, thus driving that price up.

Since when has FIAT ever increased in value by almost 400% in 9 months. 
My Bitcoin holdings have in 2017 even with the 25% drop in a day you are referring to. 
To spell it out for you because you seem a bit "simple" ... If I had $100 in USD on January 1, 2017 it is worth about $90 today because the value of the dollar has gone down since the beginning of the year. Conversely, $100 worth of Bitcoin on January 1, 2017 is worth almost $400 USD today ... even if you argue that the value of those dollars is reduced by 10% because the decline in value of the dollar, (which only applies if I cash out to fiat) it still has the buying power of $360 vs. the $90 had I just held onto FIAT. 
Cash out if you want but FIAT is dying a slow and painful death. Cryptocurrency is the future and is here to stay.

What was the premium you paid for the shares of GBTC vs. the taxes you would have paid?
As of the time of this comment the the GBTC premium has dropped to around 30% over the actual cost of the Bitcoin but a week ago it was over 60% so I would think it best to run the numbers first to see what makes more sense at the time of the purchase. Pay the taxes or pay the premium, whichever costs less. Also keep in mind the taxes would also likely warrant a deduction on your income taxes which would reduce your taxable income for the year, and reducing you overall tax liability for the year. 
If you have the knowledge and the ability to secure your Bitcoins, it is always my opinion that it is better to hold the commodity itself than to pay a premium to have a share of a trust that holds them for you 
Just my opinion .. good luck.

Fees get high because the men pool fills up and transactions are competing to get included in the available block. Think of it as 100 passengers competing for 50 available seats on an airplane. They start bidding against each other and the airline seats the 50 people who are willing to pay the most and the rest go on standby until the next plane comes and then it starts all over again. 
The problem is that the miners are the airlines and control how many seats are available forBitcoin transactions. The miners follow the profit so at times they mine Bitcoin cash which leaves fewer “seats” available for Bitcoin transactions which causes a backlog and higher fees. Then when it becomes more profitable for them to mine Bitcoin, they switch back, the backlog goes away and fees are lower. 
Unfortunately this condition will get worse before it gets better. There is only so much hash power (mining power) and when/if the S2x fork happens, the “mining” power will then be split between Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash and S2x. Conventional wisdom says the miners will follow the profit but there are some unscrupulous actors in the mining world who may deliberately mine at a loss in interest of choking Bitcoin. Their thought is that if they can slow transaction times to a crawl and increase fees,people will stop using Bitcoin and the price will Tank and they can steal the Bitcoin name to be used for the altcoin (BCH or S2x) that they support. 
No doubt it is going to be a wild ride.

@_date: 2017-10-14 04:39:40
Yes 
Increase in block size increases the difficulty. An substantial increase in difficulty requires even more specialized hardware thus increasing the cost of entry into mining. People used to be able to mine with regular cpu's and now that is no longer possible. A substantial increase in difficulty will all but assure that only deep pocketed miners will be able to mine profitably. Further, if as a community we allow the miners to DICTATE the direction of Bitcoin vs. reaching a real consensus then Bitcoin will truly be centralized and we may as well call it PayPal 2.0
@_date: 2017-10-06 09:53:24
I disagree. No one believe Bitcoin cash is Bitcoin. It is simply a poorly planned altcoin and as far as Bitcoin forked alt coins diluting the value of Bitcoin, I say to you that on August 1st when BCH was created, Bitcoin was hovering around $2700 USD per coin. Here we are a little over 60 days later at about $4400 per coin level (having already tested the $5000 point) ... in any investor's eyes, that is a hell of a short term (very short term) gain. So how you think a Bitcoin forked altcoin dilutes the value is beyond me.

Hey Brian,
Do you think this is some kind of game?
You are running a business, a rather large  business in an industry that is very small at the moment but that is going to explode in the not too distant future. There are going to  be major players coming into the US based exchange market   (Goldman Sachs) comes to mind. Coinbase has the 1st to market advantage but rest assured the community will not forget these absolutely ridiculous decisions that you are making. 
The community has spoken and clearly said NO2x and the community (those buying and selling through Coinbase and GDAX) are the ones who make your company the big fish that it is currently. 
Guess what???
We, the community, will not forget. We will not forget how you flip flop in a 24 hour period. We will not forget how you and a bunch of suits tried to hijack Bitcoin. We will not forget that you turned your back on us. 
What we will forget is your name as you become insignificant in this rapidly growing crypto space. 
What we will forget is the Coinbase/ GDAX name as they too become insignificant in this space.

We will exceed the "maximum" for October 2017 within the next 48 hours. 
Will you update and claim it to be accurate again???

Sure... just like governments collude to establish world peace, end world hunger, control pollution, protect the ozone layer, stop global warming and end homelessness. 
Get real ... you can only get 4 out of 5 dentists surveyed to recommend Trident gum.

Wow ... I believe you. 
Can I just transfer all my Bitcoins to you and have you keep them safe for me?
Because I trust the "brand new technology" known as proveably fair and everyone else should too.

Simple, you should work hard and whatever discretional income you have (that you can afford to lose) you can consider purchasing Bitcoin with. 
The idea that with no financial investment and no real knowledge that you can somehow mine Bitcoin and make a profit doing so is ridiculous. If that were the case then don't you think everyone would be doing it?
Callous ... no
Realistic ... yes

It is simply a formality and part of the process. The BATS exchange is the party that filed the paperwork and the SEC as a courtesy and as part of the appeal process agreed to review the ruling. 
Had the Winklevoss twins filed the request the SEC probably rejects it but since it was the actual exchange itself the SEC decided to approve the review. 
Nothing has changed and neither will their decision.

Traditional finance guys scared to death of the future. Soon enough they will be looking for work and unless they evolve will have as hard a time finding a job as a typewriter repair man does. 
Just sayin!!!

Has Fibonacci retracement ever happened before in the life of Bitcoin (that was not otherwise explained by external forces ... I.e. Mt Gox ... the answer is NO) ?
Then why on God's green earth does the quoted analyst (Nicole Whatshername) think it will apply now?
Ain't happening !!!

Every single one of us has a vested interest and also an OPINION about how scaling should happen. What makes your opinion more valid than mine or anyone else's for that matter?
Inactivity, slow confirmation times and high transaction fees will be "the death of Bitcoin" not compromise.

You definitely did not get banned for buying $100 per day. That is a non event to each of those exchanges. 
You know full well why they banned you so stop wasting our time with bullshit.

Sure ... I want to tell your little website what my crypto holdings are. 
Why don't I just store my private keys with you too. 
@_date: 2017-07-19 12:34:36
Stop trying to scare people to further your own private agenda. The vast majority of bitcoiners are happy that the scaling debate appears to be over for now. I've grown sick and tired of you snot nosed little kids who don't understand the word "compromise" 
You fucking millennials have been coddled your whole lives and believe that every child deserves a trophy. 
Guess what? The real world is different. There are winners and losers and the losers don't deserve a trophy and compromise is NOT a 4 letter word!!!

Craig Wright desperately wants to be Satoshi and even claimed/claims that he is. However, when challenged for proof, he has not and cannot provide any. 
All he had to do was move a couple of the original (Satoshi owned) coins and the entire Bitcoin community would bow down and universally accept him as Satoshi. Seems simple enough ... right?
He did not and cannot move those coins ... Wanna guess why????
Because he can't. He does not own or have access to those coins, therefor he can't move them. 
While Craig Wright is a very smart (some would say genius) man, he is not Satoshi. 
Simple as that.

Play in their sandbox and you need to play by their rules. Stop whining about it was only 1 time. 
Don't want to use an exchange with rules, localbitcoins with a 20% + premium sounds about right for you. 
It is people like you who further perpetuate the stereotype that Bitcoin is only good for drugs, gambling and money laundering.

That only happens when you choose to use a debit card instead of ACH. What he incurred were international processing fee from his bank for using a debit card. Coinbase processes out of the U.K. And if you use a card of any sort for purchase you will incur a similar charge most likely. 
If you don't need the coin right away, use ACH and wait a week for the coin to arrive with no international fee.

So you don't care what type of car, what condition it is in or whether it is worth the asking price so long as the seller is willing to accept Bitcoin as payment. 
Sounds like a solid plan to me!!!

If you have to ask that question it would seem to me that the investor picked the wrong person to assist him/ her. 
But ... 
Since you asked, have them wire me the money and I will send you Bitcoins ... I promise!!!

The bottom line is if they can't support the volume then they should pack up and leave this space. They are trying to secure $100 million in new financing at a 1 billion valuation. While that may or may not be a reasonable ask, why would anyone help fund a company that cannot even get the basics right. 
Every single day, multiple times per day, their performance is degraded at best or unavailable altogether, at worse. 
Can you imagine if trader on the NYSE could not trade their stocks in real time because their brokerage firm had degraded or unavailable service?
Pretty safe bet that they would find another broker. 
It would seem to me that a new exchange should be formed and that $100 million that Coinbase is seeking would go a long way to setup a stable exchange that would exude customer service and would then take over the US market. 
Coinbase it is time to step up or else someone is going to run you over someday.

Cuban didn't roast Bitcoin. He actually tweeted that he signed up for "Bitcoin Today" and you should too. 
He then bought $20 worth to see how it worked. 
He simply stated that Bitcoin was in a bubble and that he didn't know when or how deep a correction would be. 
And ... his tweets and the correction (that was all but erased later the same day) were not correlated in any way.

Who says the IRS is presenting new regs next week. 
They are having to explain their actions in the John Doe summons case with Coinbase to a congressional committee but how does that translate to new refs???
