I don't really know the culture here but can Altcoins be mentioned here? Because there are some projects put there that targets to disrupt the music/movie industry specifically for the problems you mentioned.

You bring up a point that lotsa people overlook.
Bitcoin doesn't represent internet money, any government can force you to use internet money (ahem alipay).
Bitcoin represents choice. 
@_date: 2018-08-22 18:20:30
Bitcoin IS an option for people. That's the whole point. If I have enough survival money and take on work on the side I would very much prefer bitcoin.
It does surprise me though that it took coinbase so long to pay a vendor in Bitcoin. Small step for one company, giant leap for bitcoin adoption.

Exactly. Especially if their business includes assets expenses in hard currency.
That is why I believe the easiest businesses to freely accept cryptocurrency are service based. As it stands it's hard to cover your margins if the same bag of flour costs 4mbtc yesterday, 5mbtc today and 3mbtc tommorow.

Why make a scene if they really are Nakamoto? Just spend the million of Bitcoin you have in your wallet then.

Sometimes Its easy to pay someone over a fun bet with in app coins and I don't mind the data trace. Other times I don't want anyone to know I've bought a 13 inch dildo.
Also it's sometimes fun to learn about how to run a full node without downloading 200 GB of stuff.
Bitcoin is still king though.

While this maybe be true in other parts of Africa, There are ample historical evidence that South African Land was sold to the Whites in proper transaction.
It might have been a shit deal, but your (I assume) ancestors shook the hands of whites and gave the land in exchange for something. It's not robbery.
What the ANC is doing right now though, that's proper robbery. It's funny in a way, it's like South African blacks learnt nothing for Zimbabwe.
Clarify: I'm South East Asian, I am on neither race's side. Just saying it like it is based on the information I know. 
@_date: 2018-11-15 16:55:04
Ehhhh..... Did you just said "it's okay to rob land" using politic jargon?
It's stuff like these why Bitcoin was created. 
@_date: 2018-11-16 10:15:07
Muah!!! Why-a this shitpost so goood!!!!
@_date: 2018-11-15 17:21:24
I'll sound stupid.... 
theoretically isn't this why mining pool is shit?
Wouldn't trusting a pool to use your mining power responsibly defeats the purpose of a trustless network? You're supposed to have full control over what youre mining. 
Bitcoin is fucked in many ways and mining pools are one of them.
Not selling my BTC though, it's still the best thing to have in your hands.
Edit: of course im not a miner, that's how I can say these stuff.

I don't get with people don't use the opportunity of running a full node to get their hands on a virgin pi3, read for 10 hours about how to Flash an OS, read some more to learn about installing the cli client, fuck up, read some more..
That's how one learns. Even if nothing much is gained at least the experience was worth it.
Instead they go ahead and buy a flashy looking box that plugs and plays.. Smh

Trust me, you don't want "State-backed digital currencies".
