Not all exchanges need 'graphs', APIs etc and are overrun by bots trading between themselves all day long. Conjar isn't perfect; the rate is a bit steep and the ability to place orders would be good, but it's still an exchange for people that just want to buy and sell, not play at day-trading.

The OP is incorrect in his assertion:
31. Accordingly, the meaning of 'the currency of Australia' (or 'Australian currency') under the Currency Act is the monetary unit established by that Act as the requisite unit of account, and means of discharging monetary obligations, for all transactions and payments that are not made according to the currency of another country. Conversely, 'the currency of some country other than Australia' - the only other species of 'currency' according to which transactions and payments can proceed under the Currency Act - must be any monetary unit recognised by another country's laws for the same purposes. Therefore, the critical character of the Currency Act's concept of 'currency' is State recognition and adoption of a monetary unit under law. This approach under the Currency Act reflects the position taken in Mann on the Legal Aspects of Money, namely that money 'must exist within some form of legal framework, because it reflects an exercise of sovereignty by the State in question'.

Clearly it's a popular proposal, but personally I am 100% against the change. Sure, an exchange, wallet or charting site can display the price in uBTC, as many of them do, however Bitcoin is first and foremost a Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System. A store of value is its secondary purpose.
Units of bitcoin are and should remain denominated in BTC, regardless of the relative strength or weakness of the minor currency against which they are exchanged.
Look how expensive bitcoins are in China right now...nearly 4000 each, and as for those Russian ones, wow they are almost 23,000.

For anyone outside Aus who thinks this is madness, just look into 'Negative Gearing', whereby if you own an investment property you can offset any costs, such as mortgage interest, fees, maintenance etc against your normal taxable income from your job.
In addition, any capital losses you make can be used in future years to offset gains, and if you run a business there's a whole heap of deductions...for example 'working girls' can claim deductions for toys and fetish gear.

Flawed logic, they're more likely to be sending ebay parcels. Traditional mail revenues are declining rapidly, e.g.
....Until now the successful parcels business has been on a growth trajectory thanks to the boost in deliveries resulting from online trading (particularly retailing). Until the second half of the 2014 financial year, this had been sufficient to offset the slowing volumes in the delivery of traditional mail.
But no longer. The rate of decline in the volume of letters being sent by snail mail (as it is affectionately known) is accelerating.
Digital disruption is nothing new, and many businesses have felt its sting. But the trajectory of decline is hard to predict. Print media companies sustained respectable margins for years after online content and advertising started to gain traction, but the shift to online has moved much more rapidly in recent years.....

A few errors, I edited your first para thus:
Permanently keeping the 1MB (anti-spam) restriction is a great idea, if you are a bank. Those favoring a permanent 1MB cap, whilst asserting that Bitcoin can still be a financial backbone of sorts, don't know how right they are. The problem isn't a limit in general but 1MB is so low that, under any meaningful adoption scenario, it will push all individual users off the blockchain to rely on trusted third parties. 1MB is useless for end-user direct access, but is sufficient for an inter-‘bank’ settlement network.
If the cap is not raised to some higher limit; allowing a larger number of users to maintain direct access, then individuals will be priced out of the blockchain. If or when that happens Bitcoin becomes yet another network with no direct (peer) access; like FedWire, SWIFT, and other private closed transfer networks.
There is no realistic scenario where a network capped permanently at 1MB can both have meaningful adoption whilst maintaining direct access to the blockchain by individuals. To be clear, by ‘direct access’ I mean parties transacting on-chain without relying on an intermediary or trusted third party.

Currency pairs are expressed as units of one ISO currency symbol to another; these often have nicknames e.g. GBPUSD (Cable), AUDUSD (Aussie), USDCAD (Loonie).
BTC is not an ISO standard currency symbol, as multi-national currency symbols begin with the letter 'X'. As BTC is not 'official' anyway, if we took the opportunity to obtain a valid ISO code we could move the existing BTC decimal point as far to the right as we like.
Unfortunately XBC is spoken for.

No worries...Yes, that's just the public wallet address you've listed.
If you're using the original client to store the wallet on your computer then enable encryption on it. If you're using a web wallet like blockchain.info then nothing extra to do.

Can't sell via them at the moment though:
On the 4 June 2013 we decided to close our Sell Bitcoins service while we carry out an in-depth legal and technical audit, with the hope of confidently bringing the service back online as soon as possible.
We have not been approached nor had any direct pressure to close the Sell service, but made the decision to do so in light of recent matters as covered in the media.
We expect to have an updates by the middle of June, but will provide them as we can.
We apologies for any inconvenience this may have caused.

Newsnight is a national institution. Paxman could have ripped into Bitcoin if he wanted, but actually looked quite interested and open-minded.

Have you upgraded from KeePass version1.x to 2.x? The latter uses KDBX files which aren't compatible with the previous KDB, though they can be imported. Have you searched your system for both KDB and KDBX files?
Alternatively, do you have Windows System Protection on the drive and any recovery points you can roll back to? (assuming using Windows?)

Looks like a bug; I entered an expense of 1.23456789 and Toshl interpreted it as 123,456,789.00.
Exchange rate seems to work, although as with entries that aren't in the main currency, the rate is a snapshot and the expense isn't updated in realtime once entered.
Have you raised a support ticket? They've always responded pretty quickly whenever I've raised issues.

Nearly pulled the trigger but couldn't justify ~$6k for 10GHs. Profitability calc I used reckoned ~100days to break even, but not sure how accurate that is given the sheer amount of hashrate ASICMiner are gonna bring online soon.
Not sure if done the right thing or not, by not getting a blade but bought a few ASICMiner shares the other day so guess will see an increase in dividend anyway.

According to FinCEN, “Virtual currency” like Bitcoin is not “real currency”.
In that case, why aren't FinCEN's "real regulations" inapplicable to virtual currency that does not have legal tender status in any jurisdiction.

...It should surprise no one that among the players implicated in this scheme to fix the prices of interest-rate swaps are the same megabanks – including Barclays, UBS, Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase and the Royal Bank of Scotland – that serve on the Libor panel that sets global interest rates. In fact, in recent years many of these banks have already paid multimillion-dollar settlements for anti-competitive manipulation of one form or another...

Traditional Japanese candlestick charting only used two candles, black (filled) and white (hollow). With this system each candle represents the Open, High, Low, Close (OHLC) price over a specified unit of time; M1, M5, M15, H1, D1, W1 etc.
The body of the candle represents the open and close.
The upper and lower wick represent the high and low.
Black - close lower than open.
White - close higher than open.
Later, it became common to use colours such as red and green, in place of black and white, but still only 2 candles.
We now have a new way of drawing candles, which clearer represents the trend between two consecutive time periods, so there are now 4 options:
Red hollow - close lower than open &amp; higher than previous close.
Red filled - close lower than open &amp; lower than previous close.
Green hollow - close higher than open &amp; higher than previous close.
Green filled - close higher than open &amp; lower than previous close.
EDIT - Not sure what happened to my line breaks!
