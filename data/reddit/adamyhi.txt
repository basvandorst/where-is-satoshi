This is a good idea.  I feel that having access to my encrypted bitcoin stash is ok to keep in the cloud.  I can access it anywhere, it has a huge password

Yep, the only one in town

In Van, there's one brick and mortar office.  It was overrun with people.  What struck me was the diversity of the demographic of people putting some serious cash into it.    I've had my investor antennae buzzing a little on this (I'm a recent discoverer) and decided to take a chance.  What struck me was the intensity of the amount of interest from such a wide cross-section of people.   They had to lock the door at times...

Yep, great guys there.  Very helpful.  I have nothing to do with them.

"We buy broken gold"   that always stuck me as hilarious.  They just melt it down anyways...
Yes, it has a gold-rush kind of feel to it, but with a bit more knowing that it's esoteric and potentially bigger...

Export Private Keys, from MultiBit, that's one way to put them into semi-cold storage

I'll look further into this.  Thanks for the advice, tenbatsu.  Appreciated.

The cloud offline sucks, but it's on all of my devices which access the cloud when they are online.   Google drive or dropbox keeps a local copy as well as a copy in the cloud. 
Worst case is my laptop gets run over by a bus.  I access my drive/dropbox, open my bitcoin file and voila: the money is there

There's a bank machine in town which does bitcoins.  Apparently the first in the world, in Vancouver, it's had ridiculous lineups.

Encrypted offline, yes. They helped me with that.  Plus a general understanding of how it works.  I have a small amount on my phone and put the rest into an encrypted offline storage in the cloud.   I get how it works... my coins are securely off my laptop.    
As a currency, I'm not sure who would want to spend it as it's appreciating so much, but that's just because it's so new and rather clunky at this stage.  That was a motivator for me to get in.  Once it's streamlined and mainstream, we'll see what the potential true worth is.
A number of my techie friends haven't even heard of it, which is encouraging in the speculative early-investment stage, perhaps.
Never gamble what you aren't able to lose !
