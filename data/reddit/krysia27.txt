It's the other way around for us! Husband is busy working and I hold all finances + crypto investments!

Where are you located?
Tickets to Tokyo from the US are quite cheap nowadays. Skyscanner and Google Flights is your friend. We spent approx. 600$ for a 10-day trip for 2, hotels, bullet trains, Tokyo DisneySEA and Univ Studios and 3 nights at the Mt. Fuji area included! Hold on to your BTC and save up fiat for the tickets and the shiz.
EDIT: $600 roughly per person for 2 persons!
As for the ring, well, that's another story. Tip: cheaper to buy a non-branded engagement ring than just waltzing in Tiffany's.

Hmm, I thought that it's generally acceptable to use persons when you can count them. "There were many people present last night" vs. "There are 2 persons in the hallway"

Of course, us women!

I saw this some years ago when I was living in the area. Sadly, I didn't get into BTC until last year (which I stupidly also cashed out after getting ~.9BTC)

Why don't you keep .2btc and sell 1btc? Who knows, if it rises to $1m, you still have $200k in t he future!

This is a lovely Christmas gift!!! I hope you can also consider our furry friends �������� I messaged the various animal rescue groups in my country to sign up for the Pineapple Fund since it's better that it comes from them- I do hope even .1BTC can reach them - most of them charge just $10/spay or neuter for rescues, and sometimes they don't even have money for food of the rescues. I really hope they could be a part of the fund!!

My brother had invested about .009BTC from something like $30 some months ago - it's now almost $100 :D

That's weird. I just cashed in a couple of days ago (or maybe they recently changed?) using my Debit Mastercard and it still displays cex.io :O

Not included in that, of course. but I'm from Asia already. I got our tickets at $90/person/2way
@_date: 2017-12-06 13:15:14
Yup!!! I planned it around 6 months ahead and booked ahead of time! We got 5-star hotels for around $70/night, and a ryokan in Kawaguchiko area for $60/night (before taxes) :)))

Yup Dallas might be pretty expensive. Just checked now at Skyscanner, though, if OP is from LA/NY, tickets are less than $500/person for Cherry Blossom season. That would make it $1100+/person ;) Goodluck OP!

Okay, I'm opening my Excel sheet for that trip, here's the rough breakdown, please keep this as a guide instead of your threshold, because I'm not really sure how much these ones cost now especially with the exchange rate. We travelled Feb 2016. Exchange rate now I believe is roughly 1JPY = $.0095
* Bus from Airport + Train to hotel: 1200JPY/person ($11.4)
* 2 nights in Best Western Nishikasai Tokyo for 2 persons: $110
* Tokyo DisneySEA tickets: 6900JPY/person ($65.55)
* Bullet Train to Osaka (via Kodama Platt): 10300JPY/person ($97.85)
* 2 nights in Hotel Livemax Otemae Osaka for 2 persons: $110
* Universal Studios Osaka tickets: 7200JPY/person ($68.4)
* Overnight Bus to Kawaguchiko: 5400JPY/person ($51.3)
* 2 nights at Guesthouse Sakuya for 2 persons: $180 
* Bus back to Tokyo: 1750JPY ($16.625) per person
* 2 nights at Grand Pacific Le Daiba for 2 persons: $212
* Limousine bus to airport: 2800JPY/person ($26.6)
Total per person: $643.728 (divide the hotels by 2)

I know this seems like a huge difference from the ones suggesting charities, etc. But please do consider helping even one animal sanctuary. I am from the Philippines, and the amount of strays that we have is skyrocketing. The government is not doing anything about it, there are no laws on spaying and neutering, and private organizations and individuala are pooling to helping around animal sanctuaries.
I have been supporting these 5 non-profit organizations who advocate for taking care and rescue adoptions, and for neutering and spaying animals, even if it means only giving $10 for 1 every other month:
MBY Pet Sanctuary, Philippine Animal Welfare Society (PAWS), Philippine Animal Rescue Team (P.A.R.T), PPBCC Philippine Pet Birth Control Center Foundation and CARA Welfare Philippines. 
Of the five, MBY Pet Sanctuary needs the most help - they even have trouble paying for their electricity of around $400/month, which powers their water pumps. Cats and dogs are left sometimes with only 1 meal a day. There are days when they don't even have anything to eat. PPBCC, on the other hand, travels all over the Philippines to provide free spaying and neutering services.
All of these organizations have their respective Facebook pages and Paypal donation buttons.
In the Philippines, your $10 is more than enough to provide for sponsorship for 1 dog or 1 cat. Or for spaying 1 cat or 1 dog. So 1 BTC, even divided by these 5 foundations, will be huge. 
They do not have any Bitcoin donation set up, but will gladly help them set up one, if needed.
Thanks, OP, for helping out those who are needy, and for giving ua an opportunity to suggest, even if it doesn't really mean being picked as a winner.

Started BTC at around mid-2016. I actually cashed out when I won BTC casino of around 0.5BTC /wrist
Again won in August 2017 at around $3000-$4000 and cashed out .13BTC.
Bought now again at $8000 and I swearrrrrr I shall not cash out again until after my spawn in my tummy can physically tell me to cash it out.
