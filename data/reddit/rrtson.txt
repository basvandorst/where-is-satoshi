I was part of the Bitcoin community since near the beginning and I can guarantee you that when Bitcoin had a similar market cap to Dogecoin, the people over at bitcointalk were just as greedy, vile, and rude as they are now. 
Dogecoin's community has exploded in just a few months and is just as friendly, if not more, as day one. Bitcoin almost seems like a portrayal of the current baby boomer generation: bitter, condescending, and... aging.

Calling people idiots for not believing in Bitcoin will definitely make people want to come join your band. I can already smell the eager participants.
Places without access to banking are also places that are too technologically deprived to understand how to secure/store/use Bitcoins. The people who you expect to use Bitcoins to pay for groceries via smartphones at their local marketplace are the same people *manufacturing* your smartphones in a sweaty factory for 16 hours a day, earning a meager wage that wouldn't even allow them to afford a smartphone after a year's worth of work -- let alone give them enough leisurely time to sit there watching charts on bitcoinwisdom 24/7, and study what exactly a Bitcoin is. 
Not to mention, if they ever do have enough spare change to buy Bitcoins, the market is so heavily manipulated by whales and early investors that they would possibly see the little wealth they have drop by half in a matter of hours. Definitely inspires confidence. Fiat might devalue by a few percent a year, but at least it's a fixed and predictable rate. The same cannot be said for Bitcoin.

Uh, when did I ever say merchants *didn't* prefer cash/bitcoins? Of course they prefer it due to the low fees. But that disproves my point how? If accepting carrots through a carrot-to-fiat service allowed merchants to trim 2% off fees, they'd jump on the boat in a heartbeat too.

Just because your losses have not being realized does not mean you have not lost anything. The value of your assets has decreased. You've lost value of your property, bargaining power, etc. One of the most important tenets of investing is this:
*"Cut your losses short, and let your profits run."*
Why is this so important? Because losses will hurt you more than profits will help you. At $450, BTC has now fallen 63% since the $1200 high. If anyone has been holding that entire time, they've lost the majority of the monetary value of that holding. But the interesting thing about that drop is that if anyone in such a position is wanting to hold on until they make that 63% back, they now need the price to rise *not* by 63%, but by **267%**.
@_date: 2014-01-27 01:56:23


No; it shows that they are baring their teeth, and that *you &amp; I* should be worried. JP Morgan and the establishment bankers have trillions upon trillions at their disposal. If they wanted to crush (or cripple) Bitcoin, they could at any moment. Our $10B market is pocket change to these guys. If Bitcoin grows enough to make them feel threatened, you can bet your ass they're going to react in a way that would make casual investors flee the Bitcoin market, forever.
Just think of Bitcoin as the rebellious 13-year-old in a household, thinking he's all grown up and shit. The dad (banksters of the fiat system) is still king of the hill. Sure, go act tough, flex your little muscles, run your big mouth. It's all fun and games until a certain point when that invisible line is crossed. Then the belt comes out. When the door closes behind dad, and Bitcoin is face-to-face with an imminent beating, we're all going to be cowering in a corner hoping to high heavens that the people who are *truly* in power won't completely obliterate us into oblivion.

Jesus Christ. I never thought I'd be on the other end of the pole criticizing people for their hatred of regulation, but the delusional anarchists posting here are starting to make libertarians like me look liberal.
OP I agree with everything you said. Regulation is mandatory for cryptocurrencies to grow. We've already hit a "soft" ceiling in which we can't grow any further, unless the existing powers set certain guidelines for us to continue building our railroads. All of the panelists at the NY hearing today agreed that there needs to be *some* sort of regulation.
@_date: 2014-01-29 04:16:32
Ah yes, there's that word again. I'm sorry to say, but if you believe any and all types of regulation/law are borne from the devil, then I don't think Bitcoin is for you.
All of the panelists up there today at the NY hearing -- who if I might add have a far greater stake in Bitcoin financially than you or I -- have advocated for *some* sort of regulation to "clear the air" and sort out what exchanges/financial institutions can or cannot do. Regulations legitimize and promote wider adoption, allowing more regular folk to have greater confidence in storing their wealth in a protocol that is being actively flushed with bad actors.
@_date: 2014-01-14 20:53:50
But how do you determine who gets to stay in what pool and who doesn't? What percentage is acceptable for a pool to be at? 24.99%? 18.4678%? At what point do you say a pool is "too large" for more people to join? The answer is you can't. Everyone *knows* a large pool is bad. But at the same time no one wants to be the one to switch. And none of them should be held accountable for switching since, again, there's no way for anyone to determine who needs to get out or who doesn't.
This is called Tragedy of the Commons. If it's not GHash.IO, it's going to be some other pool in the future. People will gravitate to the most attractive (lucrative) pool in a free-market. So who are we to tell anyone what to do? Again, the game itself is the one that needs to be fixed; not the players who are playing the game.
@_date: 2014-01-02 04:42:36

Ding ding ding; we have a winner! The more I learn about Bitcoin, the more I wonder, what's the fucking point? Limited supply? I say artificial (altcoins). No regulatory central authority? Looks like we're going to need one after the MtGox fiasco. Safer than fiat? Refer to OP. All of the supposed "benefits" are either marginally noticeable or are going to become erased in the long-term if Bitcoin is ever supposed to become mainstream.
@_date: 2014-01-14 16:06:10
We *should* be honest about it. But the problem is that everything is easier said than done. Changes to Bitcoin are slow-moving and take a lot of collaboration/agreement between multiple groups/individuals since there's no central authority that can push changes through overnight. 
The alternative is what we see now: everyone screaming at the top of their lungs for everyone else to switch from GHash.IO, which is essentially like putting a bandage on a fracture.
There's also a third alternative, which is to let the free-market play out and eventually Bitcoin will meet its end.

No, she mentioned alternatives as a *possibility*, but she did not state that as a certainty. 
Bitcoin is not guaranteed to be king. Her main point was to let regulators know that they need to take an agnostic approach to creating regulations that would ensure innovation is not stifled. Innovation doesn't just include those within Bitcoin. It also includes innovations *outside* of Bitcoins, as in other cryptocurrencies.

Are you familiar with the term "whales", "walls", and "manipulation"? The exchanges are completely unregulated and large exchanges like OKCoin have already been accused of faking trade volume to prop up prices. Immediately after they were pinpointed by news sites, their volume dropped off in mid-December. The exchange operators have all of the relevant information at their fingertips -- trade volume, how much fiat is sitting on the sidelines, how much BTC is being shorted, how many orders are sitting at what prices, etc, etc. They are the first ones to know when the market moves, and with the information, they can also manipulate exactly what the market *does*. All of the financial oversight and regulation do not apply to cryptocurrency exchanges at the moment, and thus none of them are held accountable to provide transparent data to a third party. That is the same reason why we had the whole MtGOX fiasco. Not a single one of them is playing by the books.

Well, that was a hyperbole to demonstrate my point.
The thing I wanted to make clear is: what's the original motivation behind merchants wanting to use Bitpay? Did they sit there one day and suddenly think to themselves *"man, accepting Bitcoins at my store would be pretty cool"*, or was the initial motivation to search for a service that would reduce their credit card fees?
That is to say, merchants have no "allegiance" to Bitcoin. What if another equally secure payment processor comes along that, for example, only processes WTFcoins, while offering an even bigger reduction in fees than Bitpay does? Since the merchants never hold any coins anyway, it would be the exact same thing for merchants to accept WTFcoins as they do for Bitcoins, except now, with WTFcoins, they save even more money.
@_date: 2014-01-10 04:38:58
Badges at the footer of every page that advertise stuff like "We accept..." and then a thousand different payment processor logos make e-commerce sites look cheap, cluttered, and poorly designed.

And Litecoin hasn't crashed back down in a week like you claimed. Bitcoin is **not** the fastest growing coin right now, and newcomers are increasingly looking for more lucrative opportunities.
Also, the Dogecoin subreddit/adoption has grown at a faster pace than any other coins to date (yes, even Bitcoin and Litecoin).

Bitcoin is pretty much just digital cash, which from a consumer standpoint, is simply stupid to use online. This is the same reason why I also don't use debit cards to make purchases.
A debit card is a link directly to your bank account, where your money is stored. Once you pay, the money is gone from your account, much like how when you spend Bitcoins, they are gone from your wallet. Credit cards, on the other hand, offer a *buffer* between the merchant and you. When you use a credit card, you are spending *credit* from a third-party. It essentially allows you to buy things with money that is not yours, and within the 30-day grace period, you can pay the CC company back if everything goes smoothly. But if things *don't* go smoothly with the merchant, you can always file a claim and the CC company will 99.9% of the time reverse the transaction(s) for you.
I can literally carry $50,000+ of credit with me at all times and feel secure, while I would definitely feel uneasy carrying $50,000 worth of cash or Bitcoins with me.

When the issue is a potentially imminent fatal blow to Bitcoin, threatening to completely undermine the very protocol that Bitcoin was built on, then you can safely that investors aren't going to have the patience to sit around and consult with fellow Bitcoiners to resolve anything. You're dismissing the fact that there's no central authority to enact changes overnight. 
The majority of investors at this point are here for speculation, and will jump ship at the first sight of true danger. The panic that would ensue would be thousands of times worse than the crashes we've seen in the past. If a suitable altcoin were to arise, the ease of trading Bitcoin to that altcoin would trump staying in Bitcoin.

It actually doesn't make it safer or easier for you to pay with Bitcoins. 
BitPay is a service that largely benefits the seller by converting BTC into fiat. BitPay offers no *buyer* protection in the case that the seller scams you (doesn't deliver, etc). 
In other words, BitPay isn't like PayPal where you can files claims to get your money back.

And now you're just conflating 2 entirely different things. First you started off talking about "usefulness", and now you're talking about "value". Usefulness =/= value. Also, if you're talking about value, the global market cap of gold is 6.7 **trillion**. Bitcoin's market cap is barely 7 *billion*.

Not even close. Perhaps it will *inspire* a future Type I currency, but in its current state, Bitcoin is not a viable Type I currency. First, wealth is concentrated within a small number of individuals. Secondly, it consumes way too much power to be self-sustainable (not to mention, only the rich have the power to mine). And there still exists inherent issues such as the 1MB transaction limit, irreversibility, and high volatility.

I wish I could give you and more upvotes. Realistic viewpoints like yours often get buried in a hurry, when everything you said is in fact true. 
I've given Coinbase hundreds of dollars in fees just from buying/selling, and the exchanges I trade on are all run by shady people who charge equally high fees for every transaction. The exchange owners, and the whales they're undoubtedly partnered with, can manipulate the market without repercussions since the cryptocurrency world is virtually unregulated. When you take that into account, Bitcoin really isn't decentralized at all. It's just a bunch of techno-mobsters at the very top who run a great marketing campaign to get "new blood" into this gigantic scheme.

No, if you were truly an atheist (like I am), you would understand that religion is **a belief** in a deity, deities, or set of principles **in absence of demonstrable evidence**.
With statism vs anarchism, you don't need to "believe" regulations work, because it has been demonstrated in all of human history that for a civilization to flourish, regulations need to be in place (hence the Constitution/Amendments, etc). Likewise, in all of human history there has been no instances where a civilization has been *successfully* built on top of anarchism. There's always a head of a tribe, a leader of a clan, a committee of a town hall, a president of a country, etc. If people interact, hierarchies will inevitably form to facilitate the community, some for better, some for worse, depending on the leadership.
So if you assert that anarchism is the only way of life, you'll have to provide evidence to support your claim. Because I mean, you're an atheist and all, so you should already understand that concept.

Not when the top holders now manipulate the prices of Bitcoins on a daily basis. You might be familiar with the term "whales". They are the same reason why there is so much volatility. Ever looked at bitcoinwisdom? Those orchestrated 20%+ flash crashes? Yep, those are the same people you are idolizing like deities.
If your target Bitcoin audience is supposed to be some poor fellow living in a third world country, Bitcoin is the furthest thing from a reliable store of value. A vast amount of Bitcoins is held in the hands of the few, who play the markets like it's a game. At least with fiat, I can predict what my money will be worth in a year's time. With Bitcoin, I can't even predict what my money will be worth in a day's time.

If the protocol is broken, which it is, then the only other option is to abandon Bitcoin if you can't fix it. Convincing people to switch to p2pool is only a **temporary** solution, that may or may not work. Large pools will always be a threat to Bitcoin.

I've had **2** credit cards that have gotten compromised in my **9** years of using them. Guess what happened each time? American Express detected fraudulent charges within 24 hours, contacted me, reversed those transactions, and sent me out a brand new credit card with 2 business days. That's called **consumer protection**. And that's on top of the total cash back rewards I've gotten, which is well over $20,000 in cash (I travel a lot). 
Now, let's go back to Bitcoins. What happened to all of those thousands of wallets that got hacked when certain online merchants' databases were compromised? Ah, that's right -- gone forever! It's the same reason why I don't use debit cards. Because using Bitcoins to make online purchases = using virtual cash. 
Credit cards act as a buffer because you are actually spending the credit card company's **credit**, in which you pay them back later with your own cash.

Other than that, Dogecoin is an easily-mined Scrypt coin, has a ton more coins in circulation (makes people feel rich), and they tip people on every single thread. Its whole fun and friendly vibe is also apparently exactly what keep people in the community. Many Dogecoiners accuse Bitcoin/Litecoin/Peercoin/etc of being too serious, and if you're looking for a reason why Dogecoin has rocketed past the others, that's as close of an answer that I can find for you. 
It doesn't matter if Dogecoin started off as a satire of Bitcoin. A currency's viability is tied proportionally to the amount of people who are willing to use it, and if a lot of people are using Dogecoin, then that is what gives it its legitimacy.

Anarchists are usually comprised of rebellious 14-year-olds who have a strong disdain for anything related to "authority" and a myopic view of the world in general. They usually grow out of that phase once they enter the real world and realize people are inherently greedy and need to be controlled to a certain extent. The "free market" is a lie. Even if you wanted to "vote with your wallet", over half of the shady things corporations do are done behind closed doors, so consumers would never be able to know if they're being screwed sideways. A regulatory third party is necessary to keep everything in check, particularly when lots of money is involved.

Except Bitcoin is not the technically most superior coin anymore. The only thing it has going for it is the network effect (many people use it). However, that "advantage" can change in the future, much like how everyone jumped ship from MySpace to Facebook. 
The existing infrastructure doesn't just help Bitcoin -- it helps all future cryptocurrencies that will come along in the future. When exchanges start trading in more altcoins, Coinbase will start buying/selling those altcoins, which means merchants using Coinbase's API can also start altcoins at zero added cost. Existing ATMs can also have their software/firmware mass-updated to accept altcoins. So as you can see, the "Bitcoin infrastructure" is an illusion. There is no guarantee that Bitcoin is going to stay as "gold" status forever. The current market is like a podium, where certain coins take 1st, 2nd, 3rd place, and can lose their podium ranking should a better coin ever come along to dethrone the leaders. In comparison, *real* gold has physical properties that no other element can ever reproduce, which is why gold has stayed valuable for centuries upon centuries.

Businesses are about **reducing** as many variables as possible to gain a reliable source of profit. Introducing Bitcoin into the equation nullifies that goal entirely. Bitcoin has its upsides, but you're deluded if you think it's suitable for businesses to hold onto BTC in its current state.

Their debt is in no part due to the "big scary banks". Americans in general simply have poor money management skills. If you are suggesting that Bitcoin can somehow relieve these people of their debt, Bitcoin actually requires ***more*** money management savviness, not less. 
If you make a mistake with Bitcoin, you stand to lose your **entire** Bitcoin savings, permanently. There's no take-backs. With the existing financial institutions, if you get your account hacked, the FDIC at least insures up to $250,000 of your money. Likewise, if your credit card gets stolen/used, the CC company reverses those charges and sends you a new card. These people need ***more*** safety nets, not less.

Nay-sayers? This group, aside from the Fed dude (Williams), had the most level-headed and informative discussion out of all the panels these two days. 
The superintendent asked realistic questions, and the panelists answered with realistic and meaningful responses. Sure, one of them was a stakeholder in Ripple, but who cares? She didn't advocate for any regulations that would benefit Ripple only. She stressed multiple times that regulations should be *light-handed* and agnostic, allowing for a free market competition between multiple cryptocurrencies. When they were asked whether a public blockchain was necessary, she mentioned that banning any cryptocurrency that doesn't have a public blockchain would be too specific and limiting, which is true. Who knows what new cryptocurrency could emerge in the future that would succeed without the need for a public blockchain? Heck, there's even a Dark Wallet being developed right now that would allow transactions to basically be completely untraceable.

That is an argument that I repeatedly make, and no Bitcoiner has yet to make a convincing point as to why Bitcoin is advantageous to the **consumer**. They always state that Bitcoin's irreversibility is a benefit to vendors, without realizing that vendors don't drive the market -- consumers do. If consumers don't feel safe spending their money, then they will not do so. 
With the current system, credit cards offer cash back rewards, fraud protection, reversibility (chargebacks), among many other benefits. There is little reason for consumers to shun credit cards in favor of Bitcoin. We Bitcoiners are a minority, and use Bitcoins largely due to particular ideologies. I like to play devil's advocate, and as I argue further with fellow Bitcoiners, I'm finding it increasingly difficult to understand why the average Joe would want to use Bitcoins. It's simply a hassle, and offers little to no benefit over the traditional system.

It's because merchant adoption =/= user adoption.
I've been saying the same thing since before Overstock started accepting Bitcoin. Spikes in prices don't happen because a certain shop starts accepting Bitcoin. Spikes happen when new users flood the market with new money (like what happened in early November from all of the media attention). You've got to give new users a good reason to go out and *buy* Bitcoin, instead of saying "hey look, you can spend Bitcoins on such and such site!" They're going to ask you, "so what? What's in it for me?" 
The November rise corresponded with people who thought they were going to make a fortune overnight, and many did if they got in at the right time. But now, many of those same people are selling off their Bitcoin, since the "newness" has tapered off, combined with the fact that we are sitting at a good $500 below our ATH. In other words, the hype-driven bubble of yesteryear is slowly deflating.

Thus, if I were offered chimpanzees at $1 each, I would be buying them *not* for the sake of keeping them, but for the sake of **immediately** reselling them for insane monetary profits. That is also how the house-flipping business works. You search for houses which are severely underpriced (which you do not intend to live in), and resell to people who would actually want to live in that location.

The existing Bitcoin infrastructure allows for future cryptocurrencies to be added in fairly easily. 
For example, Coinbase has mentioned in the past that once more exchanges (e.g. Bistamp, etc) start trading in LTC, then Coinbase will follow suit and add in LTC support. Coinbase adding LTC support means any merchant who is already accepting Bitcoin via Coinbase's merchant API will also be able to accept LTC for zero added cost.
So, if all it takes is a good number of exchanges to carry a certain cryptocurrency, then the barrier of entry for altcoins are only going to become easier and easier. Existing ATMs can also have their firmware/software mass-updated to accept coins aside from Bitcoin. 
What does all of this mean? Bitcoin may be first, but a truly revolutionary coin can easily become just as big as Bitcoin. Heck, the coin doesn't even have to be revolutionary; just marginally better with a big community (perhaps like Dogecoin). Bitcoin's current infrastructure doesn't just help Bitcoin; but it helps all cryptocurrencies. See: [Second-mover Advantage

I disagree. Many altcoins are *at least* as good as Bitcoin *at the worst*. Many of them like Namecoin bring innovations such as decentralized DNS; Peercoin brings proof-of-stake, Primecoin allows computers to search for prime chains, Scrypt-based coins brings SHA-ASIC-resistance, and that just touches upon the very surface of what altcoins have brought to the table. Whether or not you think something is a "clear" advancement is entirely based on your opinion.
Litecoin mining hashrate has also dropped 25% within the past weeks. People gravitate towards whatever nets them a greater profit. Apparently right now, the flavour is Dogecoin. And just like that Litecoin has lost a considerable amount of the "network security" you cite as a permanent fixture.

I like how most people here are saying we can update Bitcoin like it's a simple task. Some of you need to accept that Bitcoin might have been first, but it's by no means an exclusive right for Bitcoin to be the end-all be-all cryptocurrency.

Yeah... no. The risk of a "Fed raid" is a lot less probable than the risk of BTC dropping 20%+ in a few hours/days, like we've seen a hundred times already. A business needs to pay their employees, suppliers, utilities, rent on a regular basis. They're not in the day trading business. Holding BTC for any significant amount of time is suicide. They can't wait a week/month for BTC prices to go back up following a dip. With the current BTC volatility, no respectably large business would gamble like that, especially when running a business itself is already a gamble. Cue: yo dawg

This is a good time to learn about the [Diffusion of Responsibility]( phenomenon, which bears resemblance to the [Tragedy of the Commons]( problem, [Free Rider]( problem, [Volunteer's Dilemma]( and the [Bystander Effect]( 
In short, all of these theories point to **inaction**. It's the *"I would... but someone else will do it"* attitude. Or the *"I would... but there's so many people; my actions wouldn't even make a difference"* attitude. 
In this case, if there's a tangible benefit to mining on GHash.IO, each individual will tell everyone else to switch. The end result is that no one will switch to a less-profitable mining pool (or not many will) because they all assume that *someone else* will take the hit for the team.

Because bagholders dump their coins for products + no newcomers to buy those BTC = excess supply, which drives down the price.

It's easy to get caught up in the hype. I know I was. It's hard to stay grounded when the front page is always plastered with *'to the moon!'* threads. Most people would prefer to stick their heads in the sand, pretend that everything is all rainbows and butterflies, and that nothing could ever go wrong until, well... it's too late.
The 51% problem is often mentioned, but is quickly buried due to the popular opinion that it's some sort of myth. I like to play devil's advocate since I was already invested in BTC, and there's no point in me looking for even more reasons why I *should* invest in Bitcoin. However, the more I play devil's advocate, the more I realize how glaring of an issue a 51% attack is, since it really is an inevitable outcome if Bitcoin isn't fixed.

It's because they *can't*, or else their business, which run on 1-2% profit margins (read: razor thin), will inevitably fail

I'm well aware of escrow, but that is **pre**-transaction protection. I'm referring to buyer protection even *after* the good has been delivered. Example: laptop malfunctions a week later due to seller swapping in faulty motherboard. With PayPal you would be able to file a claim and get your money back from fraudulent merchants. With Bitcoin, all transactions are **final**, and there is no higher authority for buyers to contact in order to resolve issues with uncooperative merchants. I've had to resort to such measures on many occassions.
I'm not sure how you can still argue that escrow service is anywhere comparable to the buyer protection that PayPal/credit cards offer.

Even if that conspiracy is true, then what can we do to stop them? Nothing. Bitcoin's getting hit hard from all directions, and it doesn't seem like it's stopping soon. 
All of this negativity surround Bitcoin -- delayed trials (Ulbrich, etc), China repeatedly "banning" Bitcoin, mass heists, MtGox issues, IRS crap -- seems to be a series of unfortunate events that is dragging Bitcoin through the mud in a very slow manner. Anyone who isn't already a Bitcoiner will definitely read about Bitcoin, but also reaffirm their views of Bitcoin as a "dangerous ponzi pyramid scheme" investment due to all of this negative press that doesn't seem to be going away.
Sure, you could argue the "fundamentals" of the protocol are still here and Bitcoin will never die. But if the confidence of newcomers is not there, then there will be little to no "new money" flooding in anytime soon.

If the existing payment system is working fine, why would you want to implement Bitcoin? You're just introducing another point-of-failure for the business. 
Most bars I know have you leave the credit card with them, preventing you from leaving without paying, or having to pull out your money every time you want a drink. Bitcoin simply is unsuitable for these types of transactions.
@_date: 2014-01-29 18:42:41
Credit cards and PayPal offer consumer protection that Bitcoin can't even begin to match. Sure, merchants love Bitcoin because they reduce fees and are at no risk of chargeback, but from a consumer standpoint, the irreversible nature is an absolute hell-hole.
Disputes can be resolved in a single day with my credit card company. Disputes in Bitcoin? The only thing you can do if you got scammed by a seller is to complain on reddit, like this poor little fellow = 
And before you Bitcoiners jump up to suggest escrow/multi-signature transactions, that is **pre-purchase** protection. What happens **after** the good is delivered and something goes wrong (e.g. an item turns out to be defective a week after the transaction)?
There's also the 1MB transaction limit problem, that most of the coins in existence today have. This problem is insidious, not only because there is no easy (or maybe even feasible) solution to it, but also because the system could reach a point where transaction fees get so high that only the criminals are actually willing to pay to use it. If it costs one dollar per transaction, nobody will be willing to pay that to buy bread or milk, but drug dealers will be happy to save so much moving money across international borders.
The centralization of hashing power is also considered to be the biggest threat to Bitcoin. With $10B any government could destabilize the blockchain pretty quickly. Even large corporations have that much money to throw around, and regularly do so in patent wars and in fines. We're talking about governments that sneeze billions of dollars, governments that don't audit $8 trillion of missing defense spending. Hedge funds that pay billions in fines and don't care. One of these entities will eventually think it's in their best interest to kill Bitcoin, and will turn that into reality on a whim.
People also often claim that the underbanked/unbanked can benefit greatly from Bitcoin, which in fact is completely removed from reality. Places without access to banking are also places that are too technologically deprived to understand how to secure/store/use Bitcoins. The people who you expect to use Bitcoins to pay for groceries via smartphones at their local marketplace are the same people manufacturing your smartphones in a sweaty factory for 16 hours a day, earning a meager wage that wouldn't even allow them to afford a smartphone after a year's worth of work -- let alone give them enough leisurely time to sit there watching charts on bitcoinwisdom 24/7, and study what exactly a Bitcoin is. Internet service and mobile broadband are also entirely unavailable in those regions, have spotty connection at best, or are too expensive for a person living there to comfortably afford to use.
Also, take into consideration that certain individuals/companies are currently already holding upwards of 100,000+ Bitcoins each, and that factory workers in destitute places like Bangladesh are barely earning $2 USD each **day**, I doubt Bitcoin is going to be a currency that would qualify as a "worldly" currency. Just think about the magnitude in difference of wealth between those two parties. Bitcoins, in its present stage, has already developed an "elite" class of those who adopted/hoarded early, who regularly manipulate the markets on exchanges using complex trading bots. If the goal is to become a one-world currency where people residing in even the most impoverished places on Earth can confidently use said currency, and be sure that in a month, their money will be worth the same as it was a month ago, then Bitcoin does more to separate than unite. 
Those are issues amongst many others that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies will have to overcome in order to become successful.

A third-party needs to step in and decide on behalf of the two conflicting parties which one is "right". The third-party then reserves the right to carry out all necessary actions to ensure the "winning" party receives their dues, and the "losing" party pays their dues. This is called intervention, and whether you want to acknowledge it or not, the courts must abide by strict regulations throughout this entire process.

Litecoin/Dogecoin is speculative just as much as Bitcoin is speculative, therefore speculation is not an argument against altcoins. Cryptocurrencies in general are still largely speculative assets, and thus speculation is a perfectly legitimate reason to put money into whichever currency people choose to, no matter if it's Bitcoin, Litecoin, Dogecoin, WTFcoin, fuckyoucoin, or a million others.

That's great and all, but your previous argument was that merchant adoption will eventually lead to user adoption, which you've still yet to back up. How does Overstock accepting Bitcoins make people who *don't already own* Bitcoins to go out and buy Bitcoins in order to use it on their site?

Maybe a lot of you need to realize Bitcoin isn't some flawless creation that can never fail. The fact that people need to repeatedly post warnings on an online forum in order to prevent Bitcoin from being undermined/destroyed by large pools is a testament to the fact that there is something **fundamentally** wrong with Bitcoin that needs to be fixed. We didn't get to 42% because all of those individual miners conspired to get to that number. We arrived at this dilemma because this is the *natural* result of a free market and people acting on behalf of their own self interest. Sometimes people don't see the "big picture" and even when they do, they'll expect someone else to fix it, and not themselves -- no, definitely not themselves because they're too busy mining at 0% fees. 
This 51% will rear its ugly head over and over until either it's fixed or Bitcoin dies a horrible death. Expecting people to self-regulate is called **procrastination** and is futile in the long-term. Because apparently, posting these threads hasn't done anything of use. We were at 42% 2 days ago, and we're back up to 41% today. When the hype dies down, everyone switches back to GHash.IO.

Do you even listen to yourself? What the fuck is a "global digital economy" and what does it have to do with gold being more/less useful relative to Bitcoin? You're comparing apples and oranges. 
Gold and Bitcoin *serve different purposes*. It's like saying a toaster is more useful than a refrigerator because a toaster can cook toast better than a refrigerator can. Will toasters now replace all refrigerators? Hell no, because your criteria for measuring "usefulness" is one-sided. The only thing that gold and Bitcoin have in common is that they both act as *stores of value*. The similarities end there.
Gold has practical uses other than being a store of value, and will only lose its usefulness when another element can replace its physical elemental properties.

Their debt is in no part due to the "big scary banks". Americans in general simply have poor money management skills. If you are suggesting that Bitcoin can somehow relieve these people of their debt, Bitcoin actually requires more money management savviness, not less.
The average person can't even keep track of their monthly bills, loan payments, account balance, how much they spend at the grocery store or gas station. And you expect them to learn how to safely invest/encrypt/store something they probably still think is equivalent to internet Monopoly money? Good luck with that.

Libertarians here in the US are *staunch* supporters of the Constitution. The US Constitution itself is a set of regulations. I'm not sure how you're still arguing that libertarians want no regulations at all.

Only those with a vested interest in bitcoin would really respond to the survey. Generally, voluntary surveys are skewed in two directions - those with an extreme negative view of the topic, or those with an extreme positive view of it. In this case, those with an extreme positive view of it responded the most, skewing the results. This is plagued by response bias and provides some extremely flawed statistics. Anyone taking this seriously should take a minute to read how they actually conducted this survey.

Do you really think companies will pass on the savings to their customers just because they saved 1-2% from using Bitpay? **Hell no.** They're pocketing the difference and buying their families a nice steak dinner every night for the rest of the month. Just look at all the CEOs on Wall Street who are getting monthly million-dollar bonuses. You think that money came from nowhere?

Then Satoshi still made a glaring mistake in having so much faith in humanity. Individual greed trumps everything else. Read: [Diffusion of responsibility]( phenomenon. People won't just switch because it's the "right thing to do". They'll expect other people to switch, while they stay and mine at a profit, which ends up with no one (or not many people) switching.

Even if we knew their identities, and they eventually carried out attacks, they could simply say that they had a gun pointed to their head, so they had no choice. Or they could blatantly run off with the money afterwards and no legal action could be taken since 51% attacks technically aren't illegal -- just highly frowned upon. And when has something that's highly frowned upon ever deterred a determined criminal?
The bigger issue here isn't about knowing who would be behind the attacks or why they would do such a thing -- **it's about preventing the possibilty of an attack occurring altogether**. With things like money, and the notion that Bitcoin is supposed to become the defacto monetary structure of the world, you don't delegate something as important the security of Bitcoin to a bunch of questionable individuals. Humans are inherently corruptible, and the purpose of Bitcoin was to eliminate that variable. If wanted a central authority, I would just stay in fiat. That is to say... fuck that.

I don't think you understand the difference between **revenue** and **profit**. When you say "make", that implies profit.

@_date: 2015-02-05 06:29:22
The argument you presented above reminds me a lot of what I used to say to pro-regulation people. For the longest time, I thought I was Libertarian, but slowly realized that free markets simply cannot self regulate.
[This article]( was posted on reddit just a couple days ago. How long have said consumers been purchasing some of these supplements, without knowing that they were in fact purchasing nothing more than powdered rice? The supplements were purchased from Costco. Legit right?  Wrong. FDA testing doesn't cover supplements. The vast majority of consumers were none the wiser.
Now, let's pretend that there's an evil company, and you've made it a mission to boycott their products. Let's say this company is Nestlé, the chocolate company (**[they truly are evil](  It's been awhile since you read about why they're evil, so it's not exactly fresh in your memory. Anyway, you walk into your local grocery store, and your girlfriend wants you to pick up some icecream and frozen pizza. You pick up a tub of [Dreyer's]( icecream, and 2 boxes of [DiGiorno]( pizza, because they seem to be the most popular, almost to the point of being household names. Turns out... **both** brands are owned by Nestlé. In fact, Nestlé owns over [2000 brands of products]( ranging from cereal to baby food. Now let's be honest here, before this post, were you aware of these brands? I definitely wasn't.
So the above examples (along with many others if you care to look) challenge your argument of non-violent criminals being able to be self-regulated out by the free market, and that jails should only be used to house violent criminals. When a corporation has enough money, they can (and will) lobby officials, pay third parties under the table, to specifically **prevent** transparency, to keep people in constant darkness, while siphoning money away from unknowing victims. Because let's be realistic, ol' Joe Shmoe down in Arkansas just wants to walk into his local liquor store and grab some beer. He's not going to spend 2 hours on Wikipedia just to see if the brand of beer he's going to buy is secretly laced with cyanide, or if the brand is a subsidiary of an evil corporation. Nor do consumers like you or me have time to sift through Google and verify that none of the thousands of electronic parts in our iPhones are sourced from slave labor. 
We *depend* on groups that specialize in auditing businesses, on regulations to keep people in line, and on jails to remove bad actors from the pool, so that consumers aren't being scammed. I'm not saying that organizations like the FDA are 100% perfect, but corruption is countered by having **more** transparency. Not less of it. In a free market, transparency is at its lowest. It's a wild wild west. Bad actors run rampant, price fix with eachother, lie about their claims, and defraud consumers. People like Karpeles and Ulbricht *should* be prevented from re-entering society, as they've proven to be untrustworthy, malevolent, and selfish in the past. If a new BTC exchange were to pop up, how do you know Mark is not behind it? We only knew who Mark was because he was the CEO. The next time he could be an anonymous board member who's pulling all the strings.
@_date: 2015-02-05 04:11:17
There are numerous examples of non-violent non-drug-related crime where a life sentence (or close) is more than justified. Exhibit A: Enron. Exhibit B: our very own Mark Karpeles. Some people here just aren't thinking hard enough. I'm sure you can flip through Google and find plenty of other examples. 
Plus, Ulbricht isn't even getting anywhere close to life. The tentative 25-35 seems to about right for his actions. Bitcoiners should be glad bad actors like him aren't further tainting the reputation of cryptos. Are there worse people in this world who should be in jail? Sure, but that has nothing to do with Ulbricht's case. Like I said, worry about each case as its own.
@_date: 2015-02-05 04:13:21
Well, in order to confirm that the culprit did in fact stone the woman to death, you would need video evidence or personal accounts from witnesses to justify your claim. So your argument that we don't need "evidence" to convict someone is kind of amusing.
@_date: 2015-02-04 22:56:41
Other people not going to jail for nonviolent crimes doesn't excuse everyone else from ever being convicted of completely unrelated nonviolent crimes. Each situation is reviewed on a case by case basis. 
If you are upset that the bankers weren't jailed for 2008, that is entirely your prerogative. The jury has access to all of the evidence as to why Ulbricht is guilty. You don't. So, unless you have anything better than *"mommy why are you punishing me and not him?"* I'm afraid you have no ground to stand on.

What you're most likely seeing are whales who have massive amounts of fiat stored on BTCChina. Instead of withdrawing directly, they are now exhausting their funds to buy BTCs there, and will likely send those BTCs over to other exchanges to dump for a giant profit in arbitrage. All theory, but the current rally is way overbought and the volume shows that the whales are propping the price up so the prices stay high at other exchanges before they are able to cash out.
@_date: 2013-12-04 03:15:35
Irrelevant analogy. Two separate cryptos that were each created with its own set of parameters is not the same as a single blockchain that forks. Equating the two is being dishonest, as the main reason why we avoid forks is because in an existing blockchain that forks, transactions taking place before and after the fork would be desynced, causing mass confusion, and would result in people **unexpectedly** having their coins be unrecognized by the "other" side.

Matter of fact, link me to any *sizable* company (50+ employees) that pays their workers, pays their taxes, pays their utilities (i.e. electricity, water, gas), pays for their supplies (e.g. food, paper, furniture) **exclusively** in Bitcoins. Heck, even workers at Coinbase are probably still paid in fiat. Like I said, an entity like a government or private corporation isn't a bubble. Money flows in and out on multiple fronts, not just in salaries or fees. Worry about the private sector first before you move onto the public sector.
Also, the small mom &amp; pop shops who currently accept Bitcoins, and pay their 2 dish-washing amigos in the backroom, doesn't count as "small-scale".

Did you really just say that? You honestly think some broke-ass 2nd/3rd world hombre is going to invest in Bitcoin just to buy something online? Why would they ever invest in Bitcoin when the value of BTC can halve overnight? They can barely put food on their table. Credit cards at least offer the benefits of chargebacks and a panoply of other buyer protection mechanisms. Bitcoin offers **zero**, on top of the volatility. 
Bitcoin is a gamble at the moment, and will be for a long time. The reason "6 billion" of those people don't have credit cards or PayPal isn't because they don't have access to the services. It's because they can't afford to buy things online even if they did have PayPal, etc. Monthly wages in those countries are fractions of those in 1st world countries.

Opportunity cost. Ever learned it? They may lose money in the short-term by crashing Bitcoin, but in the long-term they stand to profit by preserving the fiat system. $10 billion market cap is pocket change to them.
Example: Sony lost money on every single Playstation 3 sold (i.e. took more money to build than what they were selling them for). They made back their costs in accessories and video games. Sony was playing the long game. Another example: you take out a loan of $10,000 for a new car so that you can drive to your job everyday. Yes, you're currently down $10,000 but you're making a bet that your salary will eventually pay off your $10,000 debt.

Unpopular opinion: 
Perhaps not Bitcoin, but another currency much further down the road. Taking into consideration that certain individuals/companies are currently already holding upwards of 100,000+ Bitcoins each, and that factory workers in destitute places like Bangladesh are barely earning **$2 USD** in **daily** wages, I doubt Bitcoin is going to be a currency that would qualify as a "worldly" currency. Just think about the magnitude in difference of wealth between those two parties. Bitcoins, in its present stage, has already developed an "elite" class of those who adopted/hoarded early. If the goal is to become a one-world currency where people residing in even the most impoverished places on Earth can confidently use said currency, then Bitcoin does more to separate than unite.
Edit: I'm **not** saying Bitcoin is going to collapse or fail. It can still exist and thrive. However, the "benefits" of being decentralized, and being able to instantly transmit money to the other side of the globe... realistically means shit all for someone living in less-than-1st-world conditions.

The same argument can be made for Myspace. Myspace is a mere website, that could've been changed at any time to adapt to changing demands. Anyone who was an active participant in online social media back then, probably had a Myspace account. Myspace essentially had a monopoly over users.
But then, Facebook happened. What went wrong? Websites are dynamic, and can be changed really easily right? Some coders could've gone in, fixed a few things, and Myspace would've still remained king. But that didn't happen. Facebook still ended up taking over for various reasons. In fact, the features were apparently so appealing that Facebook ended up stealing the lion's share of Myspace users.
Potential to change =/= ability to change. No one knows what particular features will become essential in a future dominated by cryptos. Heck, no one even knows if cryptos will even be in our future.

Head in the clouds, head in the clouds. An entire county consists of *multiple* cities that each have their own mayors and boards of directors. Each representative is also elected into office by the constituents and therefore you'd have to convince the majority of voters in that province that Bitcoin is a viable solution that would **solve an existing economic problem**. It's not just *"oh I want to use Bitcoins for my city"* and **BAM** wish granted. A city isn't a bubble. You have tens of thousands of workers to pay, domestic/foreign companies to contract, other cities that are in cooperation with your city, federal/state government programs to adhere to, and a panoply of other legal restrictions/regulations that would need to be overcome, just so you could *maybe* see a marginal benefit in day-to-day operations, if any.

They could've just as easily told the buyer to convert BTC to USD elsewhere first and then come back.

Are you shitting me? **Anyone** who uses Bitpay as a payment processor goes through the exact same thing. The retailer never holds BTC for any significant amount of time.

That's the thing. Hoarding itself is fine. If you have 100 people who all "hoarded" 1 BTC each, then that would be 100 people with power to influence the price of BTC. 
Compare that to the situation where 1 person hoards 99 BTC, while 99 of the remaining people hold 0.01 BTC each. As you can see, the person who holds 99 BTC has a lot of power in influencing the markets.

So much delusion in your post. Apparently you've never taken an accounting class or owned a sizable business before. Things are calculated down to *cents*. When retailers are operating on profit margins in the single-digits, even a 1% daily fluctuation in BTC price will completely wipe out their profit. They need to pay workers, pay suppliers, and pay for a thousand other overhead costs on a regular basis. 
Businesses are already gambling by running their business, and try to eliminate risk *as much as possible*. They're not going to introduce another variable into their business model that could potentially wipe out their entire operation overnight. 
Payment processors like Bitpay are the only viable means of accepting Bitcoins for businesses at this point.

As prices increase, the gap between exchanges will become increasingly negligible. For example: BTCChina has a price of $900, while MtGOX has a price of $950. That's a $50 or ~5.6% difference. If one day BTC prices increase to $9000 on BTCChina, and MtGOX to $9050, still a $50 difference, but now it's only a 0.56% difference between the two exchanges -- less than 1%. That means people trying to do arbitrage will have to own large amount of BTCs in order to gain any significant amount of profit.

Banks are an important first step (i.e. obstacle). The ultimate goal is to leave banks behind, but don't underestimate their initial influence on the cryptocurrency transition.

@_date: 2013-12-11 06:04:13
Yes, people have always said that 2 blockchains (or more) acts as a symbiotic relationship that keeps wealth within the crypto system, allowing for a buffer between cryptos and fiat, should anything happening. With one blockchain, you risk having one catastrophe forcing everyone to convert back to fiat. If there were two or more heavily trusted cryptos, people would simply ride out the wave in the unaffected cryptos until the affected one is fixed.
As for your point of anonymity, that is also another benefit too. Two or more pseudo-anonymous ledgers essentially combine to form an even stronger system that further distances itself from the possibility of authorities tracking identities through transactions.

You already have small-time whales with 1000+ BTC controlling the daily fluctuations quite successfully.

@_date: 2013-12-20 01:17:46
You're thinking of this in too simple of a manner. I'm not only referring to investment firms. The US government can make it prohibitively difficult to deposit/withdraw funds into exchanges just like China did 48 hours ago (fallout still ongoing). The same entity can also dump coins through various entities simultaneously to induce panic. Remember, the US government currently holds 150,000+ BTC, which they essentially got for free from *one* confiscation. 
If BTC is attacked on all fronts, in the end, the average joe will not want to jump through so many hoops just to participate in such a volatile market with a seemingly bleak future. Heck, the large majority of the population already consider BTC a "ponzi scheme". 
Again, $10 billion is nothing to anyone who has a vested interest in seeing fiat succeed. There are multiple *individuals* with net worths vastly greater than the current market cap. And that's not even getting into the hundreds of corporations/government contractors with bottomless pockets and heavy connections. To put things into perspective, the US government spends close to $15 billion a **week** on just the military.

Truth is, the average person is stupid. And I believe Bitcoin puts a bit too much responsibility in the hands of the user. You can't expect the average person to backup their wallet.dat files 3 different times on separate devices, locked in separate locations; much less expect them to know how to use paper/brain wallets. Heck, many people can't even remember their Windows login password on a consistent basis. You're already hearing numerous stories about people accidentally losing large sums of BTC by crashed/formatted/thrown away hard drives. Can you imagine when Bitcoin really hits mainstream? People will be losing shit left and right, sending BTC to wrong addresses, overwriting their wallet.dat files. Just walk down to your local grocery store and observe the idiocy of humanity. *Those* are the same people you're expecting to have an intimate grasp of cryptocurrencies.

Good luck with written contracts being honored halfway across the nation/globe. They're unlikely to be honored by vendors who are truly scammers. Escrow also doesn't offer protection to buyers after the transaction is complete (e.g. used laptop that appears okay on the outside but is defective after a day of use). Credit cards, especially ones like American Express, give consumers protection way after a product has been purchased. You can even double the duration of a warranty if you use AE.
"Good vendors will always offer a refund" is a non-statement. I can just as easily say, bad vendors will never offer a refund.

I understand the concept of risk and reward and have no problem with those who have become millionaires/billionaires off of BTC, much like how I have no problem with people who took a chance on Apple/Google stocks and have become rich from that. 
But the difference between the two is that stocks are stocks, and BTC is a currency. You wouldn't necessarily use your stock shares as a day-to-day currency. You would tend to hold onto stocks for long periods of time. But since BTC is being marketed as a currency, it shouldn't be viewed as an investment vehicle, which many people are doing at the moment.
@_date: 2013-12-22 05:29:19

This would be correct if your goal is a long-term investment. Buy BTCs and never sell.
However, Bitcoin adoption is supposed to be about the bigger picture. When small mom&amp;pop shops all the way up to larger retailers start accepting cryptos, market manipulation may cause major fluctuations within a single day. When retailers have to remain liquid and constantly convert cryptos&lt;-&gt;fiat, large players orchestrating pump &amp; dumps really messes with profit margins and confidence in cryptos.
@_date: 2013-12-04 03:05:16
How about I turn the question around on you? Besides market adoption, give me a good reason why Bitcoin is better than Litecoin on a fundamentally technical level.

You're making the assumption that the majority of the population right now already have Bitcoins and it would simply be a matter of walking to your neighbors house to exchange fiat for Bitcoins. Which is absolutely absurd. 
A *fraction* of a percentage of the entire population right now have Bitcoins. Some people using localbitcoins have to drive 20 minutes to an hour just to meet up with the closest Bitcoins dealer. If the purpose of Bitcoin is efficiency, exchanging physical cash for Bitcoins is the exact opposite of efficiency. You would have entire regions on Earth who would be absolutely devoid of any local Bitcoin dealers. Do you suggest that they take a boat to the United States and exchange their local currency for Bitcoins?
Again, **the benefit of using Bitcoins has to be greater than the physical effort to acquire them.** If regulations are put in place to ban electronic fiat deposits onto exchanges, or services like Coinbase, the average joe will see that their bank accounts, credit cards, and services like PayPal work *perfectly* fine still. There wouldn't be a convincing enough reason to change.

And it seems like *you* failed to address his points too. The vast majority of people today **enjoy** having an intermediary for transactions. Credit card companies offer their customers buyer protection in the form of extended warranties, 30+day chargebacks, fraud protection, cash back rewards, 0% financing on lent money, amongst other benefits. Those features simply cannot be replicated with Bitcoin, escrow services, or otherwise. Banks are also FDIC-insured for up to $250,000 per account. If you are dealing with large sums of money, most people are *willing* to suffer through a bit of annual inflation for the added security.
One of the often-quoted selling points of Bitcoin is that transactions are **final**. While that may be beneficial to vendors, buyers will see it as a liability/risk. And in a free market, vendors don't drive the economy -- buyers do. If buyers don't feel comfortable spending their money, then no matter how much vendors want their customers to use Bitcoins, it just isn't going to happen.

Your posts are vague; very vague. Accepting Bitcoin =/= running entire operation with Bitcoin. Far from it.

On the contrary, people would lose faith in the viability of cryptocurrencies due to their untraceable nature after being stolen. 
Stealing cash requires physical effort. Large amounts can usually only be stolen through an intricately planned heist. Ultimately, if cash that is stored in a bank is stolen, the bank will reimburse the customer. Large amounts of Bitcoins on the other hand can be siphoned from a wallet halfway across the globe in the blink of an eye, with absolutely no recourse.

It's one reason why coins like LTC are popular. LTC is built in a way that discourages centralized mining by putting a heavy emphasis on computer memory instead of faster processor speeds. This means that dedicated miners (ASICs) aren't that effective at mining LTC, which allows a better distribution of coins to the average joe.
Any serious Bitcoiner already knows that there are already big fish in the market who owns stacks and stacks of BTC, but will often deny this fact in public to trick themselves (and others) into thinking it's not a big problem, when in fact it is.

I'm not sure why you have to bag on Litecoins in order to make you feel better about being a Bitcoin investor. Two blockchains is better than one. The existence of multiple cryptos gives people the option of keeping their store of wealth within the crypto system instead of having to cash out to fiat in the case of emergencies, amongst other benefits.
Your condescending attitude towards other cryptos, as a presumably early Bitcoin adopter, honestly leaves a bad taste in everyone's mouths, especially to latecomers. It demonstrates your religious fanboyism to a particular crypto, and shows that you are in Bitcoins solely for the greed factor and being able to say you were "first" in this system. If you truly believe in the revolutionary and transformative aspects of cryptos in general, you would be just as excited for legitimate cryptos such as Litecoins as you are for Bitcoins. 
I suggest reevaluating your stance on why you're a Bitcoiner. Your exclusionary approach is unhealthy and sets a bad example on behalf of the rest of us.

My parents recently added a line of credit for my brother so that my brother could purchase gas and other school supplies. About 2 months ago, his credit card was apparently skimmed and the perpetrator used the card to purchase $200 worth of gas, $500 worth of groceries and $300 worth of food at a restaurant in the span of 24 hours. The credit card company immediately froze the card after detecting strange behavior, and contacted us to see if we made those charges. Obviously we didn't, so the charges were reversed, and a replacement card was rush-shipped to us the next business day.
Incidents like this demonstrate how intermediaries like credit card companies isn't the devil like many Bitcoiners portray in this subreddit. Yes, they charge obscenely high interest rates if you don't pay your bills on time, but in the 7+ years that I've used credit cards, I've never been charged a **single** cent of interest. If you're responsible with money and pay your bills when they're due, credit cards have literally zero drawbacks. In fact, they offer benefits that can't be achieved with cash or Bitcoins (e.g. fraud protection, chargebacks, cash rewards, buffer between vendors and your checking/savings account, etc).

The fuck are you talking about? I'm not talking about the blockchain.
If a vendor signs a contract stating that they'll deliver a certain product to you after you've deposited BTC to their address, they have the ability to shit on your contract and disappear since they already have your BTC. With credit cards, that wouldn't happen, since you would get your $$$ back if you file a claim with the credit card company.

1) Sign up for coinbase, link your bank account through instant verification, buy BTCs, and wait ~7 days for your bitcoins to arrive in your account. This time frame will decrease to ~4 days after your first transaction. Later on after your first transaction is comlpeted, you can verify your identity and make instant purchases. Although note that coinbase has run out of BTCs to sell today. On their site, it states any purchases you make today will be pegged at November 22nd's prices.
2) Or as xMGMT mentioned, contact someone on localbitcoins.com, meet up with them in real life, and exchange your cash for their BTCs. Which, if successful, will take way less time to get your BTCs than the ~7 days required for first-time coinbase users. Hence, the premium on localbitcoins.

Definitely happens. We call them "whales". They only have to buy enough to induce a panic buying spree, then they let the market rise. If they feel the panic buying is running out of steam, they either add more fuel by buying, or they sell off their BTC in order to induce panic selling. Rinse and repeat.

You're missing the point here. Mining Bitcoins still produces a massive amount of waste regardless of the way its mined. Producing less of a negative outcome does not negate the negative outcome entirely. 
In order to justify the massive carbon footprint of Bitcoins, you need to first prove the benefits that Bitcoins give outweigh the costs that it takes to produce them.

Overstock is getting slaughtered in the e-tailer business. They're going to be out of the picture in a few years at most.
I've bought close to 200+ items from Amazon in the past couple of years, even more from eBay, and absolutely 0 from Overstock. That website is a pain to navigate, and their prices aren't even close to competitive. Even though it's good to see this company take on Bitcoin, this is an obvious marketing ploy to save a sinking ship.

*Should* and *will* are two very different things. Regulations and manipulation will come into the picture well before BTC can even reach $25,000 a coin.

Should give you a good idea of the demographics using Bitcoin. By "using", I'm not referring to the hippie shmuck down the street with a total worth of 0.13534 BTC, accepting pennies-worth of BTC for their hand-made hemp T-shirts. I'm talking about the wealthy investors who own at the minimum of 100+ BTC, who are in it to reap some fat rewards at the expense of everyone else.
If you think Bitcoin is some revolutionary currency, let me tell you that the majority of BTC holders right now view it as a get-rich quick scheme with more than enough capital to make a killing off small-timers like you.

"Mailing cash"
**LOL**. Don't make me laugh. If it comes to the point where people have to mail in cash to buy Bitcoins, that will bring us back to 2009 levels, where Bitcoins were worth *fractions* of cents each. 
At that point, the average joe wouldn't even bother jumping through the hoops just to partake in a currency that is highly volatile, highly manipulated, highly regulated, and highly likely to disappear a couple years down the line. The entire infrastructure would already collapse from the regulations. No Bitpay, no gyft, nothing.
@_date: 2013-12-09 21:54:18
Are you making a case for or against Bitcoin? The average joe would very likely be glad to pay extra for a system that has chargebacks built in (buyer protection).
@_date: 2013-12-28 13:33:59
Payments are irreversible? You honestly think a merchant as large as Overstock isn't going to allow people to return products within 30 days? Or have you never shopped online before?
@_date: 2013-12-11 13:45:44
Fair enough, goal accomplished.

Yes, it violates pretty much the very definition of cold storage. I think that term is being used too freely nowadays. Kind of like that post where some dude's girlfriend took a picture of her paper wallet as a backup. Can't facepalm harder than that.

"All these people" were the same people you were so friendly to for the past week, encouraging at every turn to "buy buy buy!". 
Now you're acting like a condescending douche to them? Doesn't inspire much confidence in the Bitcoin community.

Proof = zilch. You don't know how many accounts Satoshi has, or how spread out his coins are.

I went through the same situation. I retried identity verification upwards of 10 times and every single time I get two questions asking me if I know some random people or lived at certain addresses that I've never heard of. Naturally, I mark those answers as "none of the above" and answer the ones that I *do* know correctly, yet no luck. 
However, last week I retried again, answered the questions to the best of my knowledge, and finally got approved. While you search for other services (localbitcoins, vaultofsatoshi, etc), just keep on retrying Coinbase's identity verification every 24 hours. There's a good chance you'll get through eventually.

Admit it. That's a bit of an understatement at this point. The bubble from November has literally burst, and stating it as anything other is euphemism.

It's funny how many Bitcoiners want to break free from the oppressive system we currently have in place, yet Bitcoin arguably takes corruption to an entirely new level.
The possibilities of transfering large amounts of money to anyone anywhere in the world anonymously is a tool that is *vastly* more useful to the powerful &amp; corrupt politicians than it is to joe shmoe down the street.
@_date: 2013-11-19 02:07:55
Because... you're getting your BTCs right away? There's a premium for wanting and getting something **right this instant**.

You are so full of hope (shit). Your entire post is complete speculation. If Overstock uses a payment processor like Bitpay, they wouldn't need to keep even 1 satoshi worth of BTC. The reseller business runs on a *very* thin margin. They cannot risk to lose profit. Just look at this past weekend. A 50% drop in a matter of hours. When every cog and wheel of such a large corporation needs to run with 99.99% efficiency, and overhead costs/revenue are calculated down to the cent, even a single-digit percentage in volatility can wreak havoc.
Better yet, go re-read the article. The CEO clearly says he is happy to accept BTC, but BTC is way too volatile to hold. They will be converting to USD immediately at transaction, as any sane business operator would. Much like the numerous small mom-and-pop shops that are now accepting Bitcoin with Bitpay, Overstock is accepting BTC for the marketing boost -- to say they were "first".

You're posting in a Bitcoin subreddit. Possibly one of the most-circlejerky ones of all. What do you expect the answer to be?

Don't know why your thread is being downvoted. I think it would be useful to have a consolidated list of countries that support Bitcoins. As more countries weigh in, perhaps we can even construct a color-coded map with "Bitcoin-friendly" and "Bitcoin-unfriendly" designations. 
But apparently the circlecerks only want to hear positive news.
