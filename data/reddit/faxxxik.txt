121? Nice trolling!

Doesn't the Blind Signature scheme allow unconscious collusion with previous owners, does it? As I understood, StateChain doesn't know what it's signing, including previous owner's transaction. Correct me if I'm wrong, please.

Would you rely on and always trust to a single information source, namely,  to not being hacked at time T?
If you want to attack a network in order to isolate significant part of it, it would be very cheap (compared to full-fledged attack on the Bitcoin network), to attack torproject site, replace the list by undesired nodes IPs, and then start a (really) cheap DDoS on nodes s.t. they (themselves) will ban all the unwanted part network.
The code, and even intentions might be nothing bad, but if you think as an attacker, you're just seeing a cheap vector of isolating arbitrary part of Bitcoin network.
What do you think?

So the terse answer is: the State chain knows **who** is the signature requester but has no clue **what** it is signing, (and can act accordingly), right?

Quick estimation. There is an estimate of 20+M wallets. Given signature size of 65 bytes, we're getting 130M of signatures per block (which all need to be verified, by the way), making it intractable.

"Blockchain" is a buzzword. Something has to guarantee its security, otherwise it is a slow and inefficient database. There should be economic incentive for the security and no human in the loop.

So it is a fixed (and known) set of keys. Let keep aside the need for hot wallet or key delegation. Then another denial of service is when some subset of these refuses to sign. You (miner) are stalled, since you cannot proceed to mining next block.
Then you can say: ok, I'm fine with taking the next in the list. But this is as bad, since violates your "50% of all coins" assumption.

As stated, the change gives the full power of control to the miner (e.g. he can only select the favorable signatures) and does not prevent the problem you're trying to solve and adds too much power to the miner. Nobody verifies the miners' fair play.

One example is a miner colluding with one of key holders, for example, who wants a fork without having 51% of hash power. This gives advantage to those, as they can discard competition blocks at will + good point in time by signing their own blocks with higher weight. The protocol gives means and "justification" for that.
Now, a Holder needs to sign the block. This means he is online and the IP address is known. That means, that it can be DDoSed to sabotage a signature at certain time which leverages the above attack even more. 
This effectively stalls the network.
In this protocol full nodes do not play any role to mitigate problematic situations. 
Security-wise, to verify signature, you must have a public key which increases chances of all attacks that need knowledge of a public key, not just an address. When you only use public key once, it is published when you sign a transaction, not prior to it.
Furthermore. If you use hot wallet, those owners expose them to a threat (e.g. IP or so) of physical identification. If you use an intermediary, you introduce an unneeded trust requirement which is absent in the basic protocol.

To my opinion, you are essentially trying to marry Proof of Stake with Bitcoin; that's not trivial at all.

This would be a built-in DDoS attack. Besides, it needs all wallets to be online which is also a huge security breach.
@_date: 2018-12-13 14:24:45
Well... looking backwards, then it might be not that bad prediction.
