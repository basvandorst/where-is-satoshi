I can just go buy some bitcoins for 100 bucks right now. Its a pretty fluid currency. Your argument doesn't make sense.

I don't verify what you enter. If your privacy is important to you then enter whatever you want.
I know that is horrible and lofi. But, the next iteration of my website doesn't even have any of those fields.

I get this a lot.
Honestly, yes, we founded in March. Does it matter. Probably not.
Talk to the hundreds of happy customers we have. Take a look at my [work history]( I have been in Web and Design most of my life and it is a great passion of mine. I am not some fly-by-night operation as I think your comment suggests.
I have built a reputation on quality my entire life and that is what I am doing with Little Nimbus. The value and quality of the service speaks for itself and if you don't like us we do a 7 day money back guarantee.
Please at least try and contribute to the conversation rather than just trolling or jabbing at my business for something as trivial as a founding dat.

I was under the impression that people with coins would love to spend their coins and they are having trouble finding good outlets for them.
I get 3-5 **requests** to add it per a month. I can only imagine that that is the tip of the iceberg since probably less than 10% of people take it upon themselves to write an email.

We send invoices via email. Unfortunately, for now you have to pay your bill manually each month as a bitcoin customer.
