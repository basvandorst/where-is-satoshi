If you're just shooting people in the head then people are gonna realize there's a serial killer on the loose, and most people don't take too kindly to serial killers in their neighborhoods. People would have an interest in stopping you because they want to be able to walk around town without worrying about a psychopath killing them so they'll probably either send their agencies to investigate and stop you.

You'd be taken to trial probably. If you don't have an agency then you'll probably have to supply your own representation. This video explains it better than I could.

It's a good starting point if you're interested in polycentric law.

Coinbase is a business. Smart businesses try to get as much information on their customers as possible. This shouldn't be a surprise to anyone.

Can someone explain to me how having several different exchange rates like this doesn't lead to some sort of arbitrage? I don't know much about Bitcoin but what's stopping people from buying coins through Virtex then selling them through VoS for 25 CAD profit per coin?

Ha cool. Thanks man

Thanks for explaining all this. I'd give you a tip but I don't own bitcoins.

I'm interested in buying in but I'm very nervous that BTC will just do what it did last time. IF you guys could convince me that we won't see another dramatic crash I'd spend a little bit on it. Otherwise I'm just gonna wait til the price starts to dive.

Thanks for the answer! I'm still a little confused though. You're saying that because transactions can take a week to process that the risk of the exchange rates changing in that timeframe discourages people from trying to take advantage?

~~Why would this make people no longer do business with them? Privacy concerns?~~
Nevermind I see how this would be a problem for bitcoiners. It definitely seems like they're going too far by closing the accounts for things people are doing outside of their service.

Thank you this is what I was looking for. It is still technically possible to arbitrage but one would have to move huge sums of money in order to make the long time it takes to accomplish worth it.
I'd assume that once Bitcoin exchanges get closer to instant and very cheap in terms of transaction costs then these discrepencies like the one in the OP will go to zero like they have in the foreign exchange market?

wtf when were they giving away free bitcoins? I signed up like a week ago and nobody offered me any coins.
Edit: Motherfucker.  Of course my school isn't on the list and I miss out on ten free bucks.
