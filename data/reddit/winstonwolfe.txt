It would have been nice if they had at least read Bitcoin's Wikipedia entry before having a discussion about it with such limited understanding of how it works.
Nice to see it starting to become a mainstream talking point though.

I've noticed most cards take 2.5% on top of their exchange rate, some even more. I'm living in Europe right now, and to use my CAD income from back home, I mostly use two Chase credit cards (Marriott and Amazon). They have the normal decent exchange rate, but don't charge a commission on top of that, unlike the others. Quite a godsend for me. Bitcoin only comes close to that I think, and hopefully some day in terms of convenience too.
Funny thing I noticed is that some in-store card terminals try to trick you into using their own currency exchange service (which they charge ~2.5 - 5% for) by asking you which currency you'd like to pay in.
If you chose CAD, the terminal does its own currency exchange and charges its own commission. 
If you chose the EUR or USD, etc. option, then your card gets charged normally and your credit card provider handles the currency exchange. 
It's deceiving IMO because it's not really clear what's happening and what you're agreeing to. Most people chose the first option, because it's usually phrased as a yes or no question.   
ie. Do you accept payment in CAD instead of EUR [Yes] [No]

It's not as simple as there was x number of shibes before, y number now; or buying power before vs now. Brand awareness and recognition is immeasurably valuable and there's no denying that doge has been imprinted into the subconsciousness of millions.

I have the Mariott card which does the same since they're both offered by Chase. Better rewards though ;)
