Speculating a rally of the bulls in preparation of SEC decision in late September. Thoughts?

Nah this is the one

Luckily I'm not at all religious so there will be no real praying going on over here. And besides, I'm a long standing hodler myself. I'll pray for you is more like, "Welcome!"

One can only speculate as to that speculation of speculation within speculation. 
@_date: 2018-09-10 14:41:03
Maybe the decision won't, but the speculation leading up to the decision will. 
@_date: 2018-09-13 23:22:57
So much pent up bullish energy, where will it go? 
@_date: 2018-09-08 14:58:15
Mid term: Bullish
Short term: Oh fuck 
@_date: 2018-09-07 12:49:54
If that crash really was orchestrated by whales then it's a bit sad that all that growth up to 7.4k was lost so quickly when it wouldn't have happened without manipulation. Without that it likely would have been a good start to a good end of 2018. Now we have to start from where we were 2 weeks ago and fight back to 7k+ before we can continue on the path to the moon. But that's the life of a HODLER I suppose. Roll with the punches, never panic. 
@_date: 2018-09-04 14:24:27
We're about to bull through 7400. Anyone care to disagree? 
@_date: 2018-09-20 22:00:35
Well that was a nice little foray above 6500
@_date: 2018-09-10 14:54:37
There's more volume now, more players and it's easier to trade. Whatever happens, it will be faster than in 2014

I agree with what you're saying about the snowball effect. We haven't seen this much FOMO in months. Everything points to a trend reversal. And everyone knows BTC won't fail outright so things like Bakkt and the ETF will only make the price go up from here. Even after going up $1000 in the last week this is still a descent buying opportunity considering where it could be at EOY.
@_date: 2018-08-14 13:43:59
I'm in the same boat mane. I don't hate BTC. BTC is just a means to an end for me honestly. Just an investment. One that I clearly bought at the wrong time buuuut here we are. Hodling with the best of em

BTC to USD being down on CBP just means I have to check it in Euros. It's the same thing but with some mental math thrown in for an added bonus. Incase anyone wasn't sure, it's still depressing af.

Well... good news was released late in the day on a Friday. News that could lead some to believe an etf is likely and institutional money will soon join the space. Who would that make interested in buying bitcoin right now? Average Wall Street investors. Thing is, they wouldn't be able to unload any of their current positions until Monday at the earliest. So to answer your question, I think it's going to be a good week as investors move money from the stock market into Bitcoin.

This dude didn't answer any of your questions and is clearly just blasting negative shit about bitcoin for some nondescript purpose.

@_date: 2018-08-15 18:10:49
You keep saying 60% but it's up 10% in the last 24 hours... check your math bro. If you had bought btc when it was $100 a piece you'd be singing a different tune. You being a terrible trader doesn't mean anything about BTC
@_date: 2019-06-16 14:10:00
Bittrex has said something similar. Do you know of a solid exchange that we’ll be able to continue trading Alts through in the US?
@_date: 2018-07-27 13:33:32
Like I said, futures give an incentive to manipulate but they aren't the vehicle for manipulation.
@_date: 2018-07-25 12:08:22
Been watching the order book for the last 20mins and some whale is attempting to keep the price down with a 60BTC sell wall.
@_date: 2018-07-27 20:30:34
With that logic you could argue that the sun isn't going to rise tomorrow. 
@_date: 2018-07-26 23:09:13
I made a comment earlier about how certain large holders need to see btc drop before the futures contracts end tomorrow... so ask yourself... is this dip a coincidence? 
@_date: 2018-07-27 13:32:18
Right but it's not futures that are being used to manipulate the market. It's Bitcoins themselves. The futures just give an incentive to manipulate. 
@_date: 2018-07-27 12:09:52
Expecting a full send on this continued bull run after futures contracts end later today. 
@_date: 2018-07-27 10:53:26
The whales who shorted btc are doing everything they can to keep the price down before 4pm today, with little success. 
@_date: 2018-07-27 13:13:48
That's what they want you to think 
@_date: 2018-07-25 15:14:53
Fair enough. Still wish someone would go ahead and annihilate this bear whale though. 
@_date: 2018-07-25 13:27:44
Exactly, they aren't letting the order actually fill just using it to stop upward momentum. When a sell wall builds up on top of it, say to about 80btc, they pull out and the 20btc wall is left standing. If it keeps going up they throw up the wall again and repeat until the price drops back down. 
@_date: 2018-07-27 16:35:19

@_date: 2018-07-27 13:11:42
My suggestion would be to wait until 4:05pm today after the contracts end. If you aren't seeing any 60btc sell walls, buy. The market as a whole is still bullish in my opinion. 
@_date: 2018-07-27 15:12:14
Full send commence 
@_date: 2018-07-27 13:53:55
I'm saying that there are people out there who took short positions on BTC and are likely doing whatever they can to lose as little as possible. I'm not disagreeing that whales, who have no futures contracts, are manipulating the market itself. 
@_date: 2018-07-26 23:11:01
Looks like we had the same thought 
@_date: 2018-07-27 12:00:52
Debatable on all counts. First off, I believe you're looking for positivity not "positivism". Secondly, it's ETF not "eft". And thirdly, there are more reasons than a possible ETF for the price of Bitcoin to increase. After the language the SEC used yesterday it's unlikely they will approve any ETF's, nevertheless Bitcoin will survive. 
@_date: 2018-07-26 22:11:46
"The SEC noted that more than three-fourths of the volume in bitcoin occurs outside the United States, and that 95 percent of the volume occurred on non-U.S. exchanges." - ETF's may get rejected but it doesn't change much for the  ecosystem as a whole
@_date: 2018-07-27 00:49:23
It's not about $ gain its about % gain.

@_date: 2018-07-27 13:37:43
Thats literally what I just said... they're using trades in the actual market to manipulate, not futures.

It's 9:14am in Seoul. 
@_date: 2018-07-26 19:56:10
I agree. 50BTC sell walls can only hold back the tide for so long.
@_date: 2018-07-27 12:50:36
4pm ET today when the stock markets close. 
@_date: 2018-07-31 14:06:35
Also you've been a redditor for 1 day and you're on here promoting some sketchy shit. Seems legit 
@_date: 2018-07-26 17:20:08
Could be off the mark here but is it possible that large holders who took short positions on futures contracts which  expire July 27th (tomorrow) could be creating sell walls so Bitcoin doesn't go above a certain point? If it keeps going up it will cost them more when the contract ends tomorrow. 
If that is the case then it makes me think that after tomorrow the floodgates will open and the upward momentum won't see nearly so much resistance. 
Thoughts? 
@_date: 2018-07-26 23:16:46
All aboard. It's like skydiving but more expensive. 
@_date: 2018-07-27 12:25:53
I believe that whales who shorted btc back in April are now using large sums of bitcoin to keep the price down by creating sell walls. They're doing this so that when the contract ends and they have to "sell" bitcoin at the price they agreed to, say $6000, they won't lose nearly as much money as they would if it had breached 9k, 10k etc. Sooo when the contracts end there will be less pressure on said whales to keep the price down and thus less resistance to the upward momentum. If I were a betting man (and I am) I'd say they'll probably jump onto the bulls side and start buying instead of holding it down. 
@_date: 2018-07-27 12:57:06
Hahaha that's fair. If you watch the order book you can see them pushing it down with a 60BTC sell wall that follows the price as it goes down. Less than ideal 
@_date: 2019-05-27 15:43:25
