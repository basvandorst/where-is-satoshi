Probably Coinbase fault.
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:26:37
You obviously didn't get the memo. Bitcoin is now a store of value asset not a currency anymore. You are not supposed to transact with it.
@_date: 2017-12-15 04:01:06
Reliable indeed.
@_date: 2017-12-28 14:39:22
Congratulations on your new piece of trash!
@_date: 2017-12-05 04:39:03
But on a more serious note. I agree, there is some major issues in the bitcoin ecosystem  that have to be dealt with(bitfinex and USDT exchanges) ASAP!
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:05:30
I know folks here don't want to admit it but Bitcoin  will become the HDDVD of blockchain.
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:03:52
You clearly can't read
@_date: 2017-12-05 14:06:31
When/if your deposit becomes available on bitfinex to let us know since many people are having the same issue.
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:40:15
Relax we are soon going to the moon, amirite?

@_date: 2017-12-21 22:13:23
Is it USD or USDT?
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:08:02
Take your tin foil hat off. And while you are at it take your shit post down as well, don't make a fool of yourself.
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:18:40
There is no such thing as fake news, amirite?
@_date: 2017-12-17 18:58:11
Nothing. This net neutrality thing  has been portrayed as a dooms day scenario and now somehow life as we know it will disappear. In other words, we are going back to the Internet of 2015.
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:38:49
Let me tell you, this sub is a big circle jerk. Comments that are not about all time highs and memes are downvoted and removed. Sorry bro, my only advice is to hold to your coins for as long as you can, hopefully the price will come back up soon.
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:12:36
That's what is going to happen to the hands trying to catch the falling knife. Don't get conned into holding some else bag.
@_date: 2017-12-12 01:32:09
Bitcoin is the official currency of the AltRight.
@_date: 2017-12-21 13:30:35
@_date: 2017-12-05 02:29:58
Bitcoin is totally traceable. The hard feat is to figure out who owns each wallet.
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:43:39
That's what the guy from the tweet should have done instead of blaming coinbase for his stupidity.
@_date: 2017-12-23 04:12:01
You do know the network fee is paid out to miners, right? 
@_date: 2017-12-05 04:32:35
You must be new here. All posts that are not moon related are just FUD. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:00:51
Right, because we at r/bitcoin even upvote bcash posts.
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:04:52
Garbage show, garbage audience.
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:14:28
Am I doing it right guys?
@_date: 2017-12-05 14:01:32
Guys, please report back if your balance posts.
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:43:36
Just do a quick search for "snl" in this sub, you will find posts like this dating back 4 years and it has never made an impact.
@_date: 2017-12-10 07:01:17
You are right, let's get ready for the massive rally ahead of tonight's episode. 25k?
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:58:04
You are missing the point by a mile. Bitcoin is a currency which is almost impossible to transact with, some folks will claim that it has now become a store of value asset but I would argue that you can not design a boat that failed to float to then fix it with 4 wheels and pretend is a car.
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:49:58
You are deluded. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:32:35
I call bullshit.
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:19:09
Show your confirmation emails.
@_date: 2017-12-20 12:59:13
Nah I'll pass. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:28:47
The salt is strong on this one.

HODL = hold my bag
@_date: 2017-12-18 03:39:51
I think he's got a point about tether shadiness but he FUDS a lot. I mean, every time an exchange goes down due to high traffic he makes you think it's the end of Crypto.
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:23:00
Can you provide proof of said buys?
@_date: 2017-12-04 04:54:24
Imagine you received hundreds of transactions that add up to 1 BTC, it will be more expensive for you to send that 1 BTC as opposed if you had received the 1 BTC in a single transaction. Am I right boys?
@_date: 2017-08-24 03:13:59
�� no, I'm talking about BTC!
@_date: 2017-08-25 16:17:15
@_date: 2017-08-28 16:39:14
Thats what people used to say when they were less than 10USD/coin. Just saying...
@_date: 2017-08-16 17:47:34
I feel this is just getting started. People who don't buy now will regret it bigly.
@_date: 2017-08-24 01:44:04
You are in for a surprise
@_date: 2017-08-24 17:55:37
I hear you man. Just hodl
@_date: 2017-08-23 18:45:28
BuY ThE DiP!!
@_date: 2017-08-28 16:41:12
Don't think about it like cashing out. What if the value is 1MM but payments are process in Crypto without fiat being involved.
@_date: 2017-08-25 22:24:26
Everybody thinks you want the drive to store the coins! Edit the question.
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:50:19
"It's different this time around"
@_date: 2017-09-26 17:31:11
This is going to be interesting. I'll give the market 2 years before a crash. Maybe around Trump's reelection. But that's just my opinion.
@_date: 2017-09-01 16:30:49
If that ever happens ill be moving out.
@_date: 2017-09-05 23:43:01
Beware the Feds!
@_date: 2017-09-22 01:41:17
This guys have something cooking but not out yet.
@_date: 2017-09-14 17:19:37
I'm selling hugs. only bitcoin accepted ��
@_date: 2017-09-14 17:16:31
I'm excited because I'll get them at a discount when weak hands like yours panic sell. Bitcoin is bigger than china.

Keep in mind that if they do, it will take a while. E.g. GDAX will not give out bcash until next year.
@_date: 2017-10-23 21:13:44
Some sort of lottery site.
@_date: 2017-09-07 21:24:08
I don't trust the guy ever since that joke of documentary he did on fast food.
@_date: 2017-10-05 23:22:36
We just don't like whiny bitches. Is that too much to ask??
Edit: Lol, downvotes for that? It's a joke, relax your anus people!
@_date: 2017-10-05 23:29:34
Is water wet? 
Just kidding!
Yes. Got a large amount? Go hardware or paper.
@_date: 2017-09-12 21:38:02
Apple never seen to do the most logical thing from the get go. My wild guess: they come out with their own Crypto and when it flops they add support  for bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-05 23:26:05
Ok, I guess...
@_date: 2017-10-05 23:33:41
Don't share how much you hold, ever. I think bread will suit you better at this point.
@_date: 2017-10-12 21:36:03
Wtf? I have more than that. Can I retire now??
@_date: 2017-10-30 23:38:59
Looks like we got cheap coins coming our way.
@_date: 2017-10-05 23:06:17
Downvoted, lol
@_date: 2017-09-16 00:10:08
Buying daily will cost you a lot in fees, your idea is good but I would do it weekly rather than daily.
@_date: 2017-09-14 17:19:37

@_date: 2017-09-30 19:09:18
Very unlikely but if that were to happen bitcoin should be the least of your worries.
@_date: 2017-09-22 19:58:56
You sound exactly like the guys telling early investors they would lose their money. 
@_date: 2017-10-03 14:42:47
I'm checking it out now. Thanks
