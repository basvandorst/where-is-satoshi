Are your patterns the same or do you do things different after coinbase didn't want you?
@_date: 2015-08-19 02:01:48
I just set up a bitfinex account for this very reason.  I watched it happen and yelled because I didn't have any money there.

- Acquire bitcoins on Circle\Coinbase
- Send bitcoins to BTC-e
- Perform quick market exchange to dollars then back to Bitcoin
- Wait a little while and send them wherever
  
Last time I checked, this worked and you end up with different coins than you started with and coinbase just thinks your using a different exchange other than their own.  Mixers are ineffective and obvious to companies like coinbase who have their shit together.

There was another post here some months back that spelled this out pretty well but I can't find it.  Basically, you are correct, but there are other factors to also consider.
  
- This test was publicized in the media while it was happening
- Not everyone was presented with the bitcoin option when they visited
  
So basically, if you read an article about mozilla accepting bitcoin donations or someone told you and you visited the site to see for yourself, you might not even see it the first time because it wasn't presented to everyone.  So you would have to visit again and again until you saw it. 
  
These types of tests are only valid when traffic is normal\organic and not influenced by external pressure during the test.  The person who originally laid this out here basically showed that the test was flawed and built to fail to maximize traffic and exposure.
  
1) they got media attention for the test
2) and they get media attention for the test results
  
This Mozilla "expirement" is continually brought up to "prove" that accepting bitcoins hurts your revenue.  And that is incredibly fucked up!

It's a nice thought, but what are the implications of this?  Will there be as much of an incentive to secure the network?  The more use cases there are for the bitcoin blockchain, the more it should theoretically be adopted and secured.  At least that is my simple view on it.

I've had really good experiences with Coinbase, I hope you don't lose money, but if you did, I feel like you should have some sort of recourse.

It's just a matter of time, Coinbase is working to get licensed everywhere they can at breakneck speeds.

From the reply, it sounds like a problem with your bank, not you.  Out of curiosity, what bank do you use?  I would just set up another checking account and use it with Coinbase.
@_date: 2015-08-21 23:37:49


  
I disagree, I think a lot of it can be prevented by removing the ability to store extra data in the blockchain.  I'm not aware of any core functionality that relies on it.
@_date: 2015-08-25 14:59:18
It's on their exchange, not the wallet service where you buy\sell.  Maybe it isn't available in your area?
edit: never mind!  I saw Coinbase_Rosey's reply.

Thank you for that, that is amazingly bad.  Coinbase will at least let you transfer your coins out before they completely lock you out of the account.  I have to question whether this is even legal, especially if they forced him to sell at a loss.
  
Also, he's not shadowmuted(that's not a real thing), his submissions are being sent to the mod queue because his account has no history.
@_date: 2015-08-21 23:43:45
That's my understanding of it.  And I should clarify, I'm not aware of what needs the extra space.  Hopefully one of the dev lurkers will pipe in here.
@_date: 2015-08-16 15:27:40
Maybe because people like me in the USA are waking up and downvoting and reporting all the XT spam bullshit.
@_date: 2015-08-21 23:27:01
ROFL!  OK, now that's censorship!
@_date: 2015-08-20 02:29:15


New computers accessing an account is a huge concern and it should be published somewhere for the user to reference if your service is any good.  We are at a point where it doesn't raise flags if it's an established pattern.  That in itself is a privacy concern for some people but others don't care.  Either way, it's an option that doesn't appear to be available for coinbase customers today.  Everyone I know uses coinbase with the expectation that they act like a bank but with higher accountability.  And they are doing a great job of living up to that short of publishing their por.  Something I wish they would be a leader in and do.
@_date: 2015-08-21 20:29:27

You should do your homework before you make stupid accusations.
  
1) He has a brand new account with no history but this submission  
2) Automoderator filters new account submissions so that the mods have to manually approve them.
  
So armed with this knowledge, you now know his submissions would have been approved when a mod got to them.  Automoderator is a very useful tool for popular subs.
@_date: 2015-08-20 22:34:10
What did coinbase support say?
@_date: 2015-08-16 14:42:33
FUD campaign to trick people into running XT.
@_date: 2015-08-21 21:04:35
That is simply crazy.  Did you sell at a loss?
@_date: 2015-08-21 22:30:51


  
I have not, which is how I know the difference between automoderator doing its normal thing and censorship.

Yesterdays price drop was because of big margin calls on bitfinex.  Not sure about today.

Make a suggestion to your management that they should implement a feature where customers can flag their accounts before they travel so they don't trip algorithms.  For instance, I can call my bank and let them know I will be traveling and to what countries and this prevents them from cutting off my card because they think it might have been skimmed and started being used in another location.  Sounds like this sort of thing could have helped this guy.

The market needs to adjust on its own to the various types of players because the alternative is regulation resulting in an artificial market that is even less secure.
   
Regulation is a band-aid for a wound that never heals.  It masks the true potential for failure and success.  Regulation is not sustainable because there will always be people who figure out a way around it or simply ignore it because regulation is almost never evenly applied because people are not equally accountable.  Regulation creates an unfair playing field because those with resources will get around them and profit at the expense of those that don't or can't.
  
Do not forget that greed is why bitcoin has attained the success that it has.  It is the biggest driver of adoption in this space.

"By making it the only way to get his money out of Circle; I know because this happened to me"
  
That would have been answering my question.  You did not qualify your response so I am taking it as an opinion until you do.

Yes, place a buy on their exchange at the price you want.
@_date: 2015-08-19 21:23:21


  
That fact aside, my actual argument is that bitcoin and monero are not equal because the size of the monero network is tiny compared to the size of the bitcoin network.  You implied that bitcoin and monero are equal but monero has privacy built into it.  Your implication is wrong on multiple levels.

Yea, I re-read your submission and it looks like it's more than just your bank, they think you broke their ToS(multiple times).  Probably from buying on Coinbase and reselling on LBC.  You should be acquiring your coins from places like BTC-e if you want to sell on LBC.

This is from the bitcointalk.org thread.  This is important because people there are treating this as not a big deal, as if it's just a matter of free spots and priority, which is a rather insidious notion.
  
*They* have already exhibited their grasp of this concept and ability to undermine and co-opt it.  Just as they can force us to pay higher fees and make us consider the unthinkable(adopting code without proper review and consensus)by using their spam attack, they will force a higher cost for nodes as well by simply playing by the rules they created.  They can completely eliminate Tor nodes by simply following the rules they created, they simply connect, a lot.
  
It won't end there either, they will continue to be at the forefront of setting the rules if we adopt XT.  So any promises of fixing code down the road are simply empty promises as exhibited by the tremendous effort it is taking to gain control of the rule making.

It doesn't have the network security that bitcoin has, so it is not honest to imply that it has everything else bitcoin has plus privacy.  Pretty sad that you're pumping monero in a thread you linked on or maybe that's what you meant by "misinformation abounds"..
@_date: 2015-08-21 20:27:08
How did they force you to sell?  
@_date: 2015-08-20 15:21:26
They've already proven they will attack the network to make a point, so it is far from a conspiracy.
