Why do banks have to provide loans? They like providing loans cause it's the only way to unlock their free money. Banks store money, nothing more nothing less. To be clear I understand your point but I disagree that lending is required to be a bank.

I'm simply trying to help. If I were in your position i'd sell any "Bitcoin" I had on Robinhood and buy it on an exchange which allows you to withdraw Bitcoin like cashapp, Gemini, or Coinbase. I would also read up on good wallets and pick one that suites me

I'm not saying Bitcoin is a Bank but I don't believe  you need to give out loans to be considered bank. What would you call an institution that charges you to keep your assets safe? To me that's a bank.

I was just saying because I'd be worried about losing a key. If you have two people it depends on what the use case is. The two people should trust each other in a 2-of-2 because one of the signers can freeze the funds by just not signing. If you don't trust the counterparty you might opt to do a 2-of-3 where a third key is given to an escrower who was chosen for their past performance.
@_date: 2019-11-02 14:40:13
You're lacking the redundancy of 3 devices in a 2-of-2 setup. That's really the only difference. 2-of-2 is arguably more secure seeing as there are less keys in total which have access to the funds.

When I was 16 I was able to buy Bitcoin by getting a parent to co-sign my bank account and registering the KYC on the exchange as my parent who cosigned. After that you can use your bank account to ACH funds into the exchange until you're 18 and you can make a new account. I have the old account to my parents and they buy Bitcoin with that account anyway.

B) If you're running a full node and the miners decide to unilaterally activate a protocol change you will fork, but nothing will change. If you were using an SPV node that was listening to two separate protocols it would get confused. If there were literally no miners on the chain that didn't update to a bigger blocksize, it means that that chain has become very insecure and you don't want to use it anyway. I believe this point is moot essentially. Yes SPV nodes follow the longest chain. More or less people running full nodes doesn't change anything in the case of miners unilaterally activating protocol changes, it can already happen and running full nodes doesn't prevent it.
D) "It will increase the sync time for new full nodes, too. This is actually a underestimated problem, we can't just keep adding the size of the blockchain faster than technology improves." This is a statement predicated on the idea that increasing the blocksize as much as discussed above (2-4-8mb) will result in this happening. You can't infinitely increase blocksize, but resyncing with blocksizes of 8MB would be tedious work for a modern home computer. It's just CPU power and modern CPUs can handle resyncing with ease. I was a blockchain developer at steemit and I can tell you that scaling to 100,000 tps per 3 second block was not a technical concern. We are not approaching the point where the blockchain grows faster than you can sync on bitcoin, not even close.
I would guess that bumping the blocksize up to 8mb would knock off less than 5% of current full nodes, yet it would facilitate exponentially more transactions thanks to 2nd layer solutions. There are legitimate points on both sides of the blocksize debate. It's my opinion that increasing blocksize dramatically improves useability of bitcoin and it's effect on the greater ecosystem of bitcoin will be net positive, although yes it will somewhat centralize the system (Though like I said I'd guess just about 5%). If you're so concerned about the miners doing a "non-concenseus" hard fork, perhaps you should consinder PoS. No blocksize will protect you from individuals hard forking the chain.
@_date: 2019-01-01 13:08:37
That's artificially making Bitcoin worse than it needs to be to push LN. Why not just do both and let the market decide?
People down voting me I'm a developer stating my opinion not a bch shill. I asked a legitimate question above.
@_date: 2019-01-02 12:37:09
Thanks for replying respectfully. I believe your points are all true.
A) right
B) I would just like to point out that SPV verification should be possible by all participants for a very very long time even if we bump the blocksize up significantly, so the only people that really need to run full nodes are institutions and miners and such. I do trust Bitcoin. I also know the incentives and I don't believe that centralizing the full nodes necessarily leads to BFT being compromised. I can appreciate your point and it would be ideal to have as many full nodes as possible, but the only people who actually need to run full  nodes are the miners and they're already institutions. I don't know I just am not convinced that bumping the blocksize up to even 8mb will knock that many nodes offline.
C) sidechains, LN, and other second layer solutions are all great and I truely do support the effort, but as I said below I dont believe that "second layer solutions" justify not increasing the bandwidth of layer 1. 
D) I agree with you and I think this may be your best point that hard forks really really need to be justified. I am not really arguing that we need to bump it up right this minute, but we could at least start outlining the conditions we need to meet in order to bump up the blocksize. I see a lot of insults and name calling any time it's brought up but I've yet to see some engineers explain when it'd be the right time. Honestly I really liked the Segwit2X compromise and I'm disappointed it didn't go through as planned.
Yeah I just saw your list of questions and figured I could try to tackle them line by line. Thanks for opening up a dialog and giving me a platform of sorts.
@_date: 2019-01-01 21:19:37
The market doesn't chose the easiest solution. It chooses the solution that benefits the individual the greatest. If you enable both options of LN or regular blockchain transactions you leave it up to the individual to decide what they want to do. If the majority of individuals don't want to use LN it's because it's not a good enough solution. Making Bitcoin transaction fees artificially high does not make LN artificially good. I love LN as much as the next guy before but I think it's quite foolish to assume you are wiser than the markets.
@_date: 2019-01-02 17:02:57
I can see your point with B) but I don't agree with the premise. If some business was running a SPV node to validate their transactions and the Miners decided to update the consenseus protocol to something the shop owner disagrees with, the shop owner should A) stop pointing his SPV node at untrusted nodes and B) start his own full node. This idea has nothing to do with blocksize. If the blocksize was so big that the shop owner couldn't run his own full node to run the "classic fork" I wouldn't agree with it. However, 2-4-8mb blocksizes are not prohibitively big. Those sizes are all small enough that a raspberry pi can keep up. I wasn't trying to pull an argument of authority bringing up that I was a blockchain developer but just give you context for my claims, I appologize if it came across any other way. 
D) I agree it's just a difference of opinions. I believe that an increase would have more benefit than what's lost, and I believe we wouldn't be loosing anything we can't afford to loose. I can't debate you the usefulness of the missing transactions. All we really know is that the transactions can't afford to be included in the chain. IMO exclusion of transactions from the main chain where it's not absolutely neccessary is a shame.
I think fundamentally we just disagree on the effect of bigger blocks. It's my assertion that if the miners do something against the majority social consenseus, peers will spin up miners and keep the original fork running. I don't think everyone running SPV nodes effects that much, unless the blocks were so big that it's prohibatively expensive to spin up a new miner. Bumping the blocksize up to 8mb wouldn't change the barrier to entry (of miners/full nodes) very much. I conceed it centralizes the system, I just don't think it's realistic to expect a global payment network to be processed by low power machines. If it can still be processed by a raspberry pi I don't see the risk.
Edit: to get back to the point " Bitcoin was created to be validated by all participants that needed to. Taking that possibility away destroys a very fundamental part of bitcoin." I agree I just don't believe that 2-4-8mb disables the ability of participants who need to verify the chain to verify the chain. 
@_date: 2019-01-02 00:25:20
A) we can only figure out this point if you define how to determine when it's "necessary". If the fees are 5BTC on to open a channel on the lightning network I think it'd be warented to up the blocksize, but still not "necessary." So your first point is just essentially an opinion question, not a researchable one.
B) it will absolutely effect the cost of running a full node. If you believe that the current design and blocksize of Bitcoin supports IOT devices being full nodes you're delusional. It does not. Home computers can run a full node and even raspberry pis but it can't stay that way forever. Even with the current design bitcoins blockchain is going to get so huge that even home computers cant store the full blockchain.
C) I don't know what this means. Cryptokitties are legitimate use of the blockchain. If we need to bump up the blocksize to facilitate legitimate uses of the blockchain thats that.
D) 2mb blocks will increase ophan rate and block propagation time negligibly as did segwit

Yes. When you spend coins out of a multisig the whole network knows
* The bitcoin address is a multisig

In bitcoin their is "traditional" multi-signature transactions in bitcoin that use the opcode for multi-signature transactions. ~~When you send coins to one of these addresses you're broadcasting to all that it's a multi signature transaction with whatever parameters it has (e.g. 2 of 3).~~ When you spend the coins the parameters are broadcast, before you spend the coins from the multi signature the setup is revealed via the redeemscript. The thing Andreas is referring to the fact that  certain signature schemes allow you to have a threshold like 2 of 3 without revealing that it's a multi signature at all. With the schnorr signature scheme, because it's linear, you can take two signatures and "add" them together to create a new valid signature. The new signature looks just like the first two, except it actually contains both signatures. Somebody who knows what they are looking at can validate many signers at a time by looking at the schnorr signature, but an outsider can't validate how many signers there where on the signatures, they can only tell it's valid. With Bitcoin this would mean you can send to a multisignature address and spend from it without ever revealing it is truly a multisignature account at all.
