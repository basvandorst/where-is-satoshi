Ah, I assure you I am not! :)
MTGox knew about their faults, and halting withdrawals was just an attempt of driving the prize down, to the point someone else could bail it out. The final nail in the coffin: "Leaking" a document - not placing themselves at the crossfire for legal actions of market manipulation.
Site dies later. Bankruptcy at a bargain, since nobody wanted to buy it out anyway.

I have seen it, it doesn't address the only request I got that he actually proves his funds at MtGox, which would add a lot of credibility. Just because he posts by his real name it does not make him legit. There are tons of people being douchebags in their real names

Still not a single word heard on this matter by twobit. I predict it will stay that way too

My thoughts exactly. Doesnt sit right with me. Only talking about Coinbase even though he supposedly has 300k usd upon gox

He does, yep

If you think they halted withdrawals to "adjust their software" you are very delusional. They merely did it to lead people on, to drive the BTC prize down to get the debt down with it. You see, if they would want to adjust their software they probably would suspend deposits at the same time, too.

I just seek a response in form of some evidence, because I believe the community have been deceived. I'd guess the string of information would be something like gox &gt; charlie shrem &gt; twobitidiot. He's just the messenger but I strongly believe he profits from this.

1, Evidence? Who's got any of that surrounding MTGOX? If I would go with your theory, why not halt trading alltogether initally when they claimed TM? Then return with a statement once it was fixed.
2. Oh I was wrong about mtgox all along! They just wanted to increase their debt as a company! 
If you think maximizing your loss as a company is the prime goal... wow. If you think someone legally and out in the open could steal 850k btc without any reporcussions wow too

twobit used to get info on mtgox through the chain I mention, now marks yesterdays news so he only gains it from bitcoin foundation. 
Charlie Shrem and him are close. You've been deceived.

Wow.. I guess I was right. Holy crap.
