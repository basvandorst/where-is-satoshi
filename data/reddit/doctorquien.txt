I am not disagreeing with you with what their role and responsibilities should be. But I am trying to see where they are coming from and one way for them to even get heard by an audience, they need to make the story digestible. That could even mean taking the easiest stance on something, e.g. i know nothing about bitcoin but it sure sounds fishy. Their other option is to try to explain to their general audience the intricacies of mining, wallets, addresses, and services that are stable enough to be trustworthy. My example for the last part is coinbase. I like their service but they do have a lot of issues and while I don't experience any, many do. Of course, banks have issues to,  but given their established and accessible nature, you can feel more secure. 
So you can't be that surprised over how it is reported. 
And they don't enforce an opinion,  audiences are more active listeners than you critics of mass media make them out to be. They constantly take in a message and interpret it,  change it, and decide themselves whether to accept or reject. I would cite that idea but I am not home and I am typing this on my phone. 
But anyway, if people, even journalists,  aren't being so kind to bitcoin, then the people who support it have to prove to them it isn't fishy or a scam.

Ah I believe get your question. I think it boils down to level of acceptance of Bitcoin. It could get to such a level were things are priced in BTC from the get go instead of just being the bitcoin equivalent of another currency. That could happen soon but it is all up to producers. When something is priced in usd or euros it's because of the merchant or producer; their main/home currency,  preferred currency.

I know that feel OP. Try looking up websites that give out free bitcoins or try mining for Litecoins and then changing for BTCs. Although while I heard this was a good idea at first, it doesn't seem very profitable once I was in a pool. 
@_date: 2013-11-09 16:29:16
I've seen a lot of posts like these and it bothers to see people trying so hard to convince someone to get into something. If they don't want to get into bitcoins now, let it go. They have their own reasons, many of which have some validity to an extent,  and it isn't your job to try to change their minds. If Bitcoin picks up as much as everyone here thinks it will, that is all the convincing others will need when that time comes. 
The best you can do is try to make the current community rallying around Bitcoin look better by showing that it is more than a bunch of libertarians trying to do illegal shit, and certainly don't make it seem pushy. 
Telling someone/spreading the word about Bitcoin isn't the same as trying to get them to buy Bitcoins so just keep that in mind. 
@_date: 2013-11-04 18:13:01

I think OP has a legitimate concern especially when you take into consideration all the hype and claims that Bitcoin is so magical, superior and a dollar killer/government cripler. Bitcoin is said to be the future but if it doesn't fit the needs of people like current currencies can.

But even when it is an option, either the creation of said goods and services or the acquirement of them by the seller may still require some form of currently existing currency. I can sell you a college textbook I own  for bitcoins, but to buy that I used American dollars.  And then, even  when  I get the bitcoins I can exchange it  for whatever currency I need. 
When you buy a product on Amazon from a Chinese vendor, you pay him in dollars (assuming you are in the US) but  when those dollars are in the vendor's possession,  they may do with then what they please - such as exchange for another currency,  spend it,  etc. In the end it does little to undermine the Chinese currency, since the vendor may choose to exchange or use the dollars within China, let's say.  
So yes, a person can  get  BTC through other means,  like selling,  but what they do with it is usually entirely up to them. Just as a person acquiring dollars.

If it's over a certain number, which I believe is 10K as someone here has already stated, yes it might draw attention. So don't transfer all at once, do under 10K, and go to your bank and find out about their deposit rules to be sure.

@_date: 2013-12-31 18:54:33
He's got a point. This isn't the best method to promote widespread use of Bitcoin. 
If you promote the usage of Bitcoin with and for the businesses that have ALREADY accepted or agreed to accept it as a form of payment, that means helping those businesses succeed via their adoption of Bitcoin, then other businesses, like that of will follow suit. They will once they see other businesses succeeding, if they do. It is what a smart,  rational business would do. 
But pestering them? That won't work and you come off as a cult, scam, pyramid scheme (they love to tote the whole early adoption bullshit), etc. 
And telling off in this thread also won't help.

As for their relationship: I recently read a description of both LTC and BTC as, LTC is silver and BTC is gold. Or something like that. 
From what I've experienced, I am able to mine LTC, albeit it small amounts, whereas I can't mine ANY BTC at all. And that's using my regular 3-4 year old laptop. I am assuming you have a better setup.

Outlaw? I don't see a reason why they would. 
Many people here talk as if this is actually some way to "undermine" currencies like the U.S. dollar but it really isn't. You still need dollars (or euros, or Canadian monopoly money, AUD, pesos, etc) to buy BTC unless you mined early on. And in which case, you can exchange BTC with others for whatever currency you want - governments need this shit to actually happen more often, if anything. 
You took something from the internet and exchanged it for dollars and then went and spent those dollars on other shit? Well, they would want that spending to continue if they are reasonable folks (which, to be fair, many are or can be). 
Instead of "outlawing" (such a strong word I see people throw around, so dramatic!), they should and or could just foster it. Or ignore it, think it's an internet game that is causing many to sink thousands into the economy one way or another. 
@_date: 2013-11-06 04:00:18

And if I am understanding how mining works and using these things: I have a mining program, and I get a similar setup to yours and connect it to my computer aaand that does the mining for me?

Awesome!  And I spent about 3 years trying to get an online business/news site off the ground with a friend. Through that, I frequently dabbled in online marketing and experimenting with new and popular social media platforms to promote our brand.

So I have some experience although it is important to note that things change fast now a days, but I catch on quickly.

The Bronx Deli? Are you located in Bronx, NY? If not, what's the story behind the name? 
I am from NYC so I am just curious

Coinbase (U.S. only) has worked well enough for me for the first purchase I ever made and it's already connected to my bank account. 
I've tried looking into other exchanges but their requirements for approval and for getting dollars exchanged into bitcoins are ridiculous. 
Sucks they can't all be as easy as coinbase.

Oh. Um. OP, never mind IGNORE everything I said above (except maybe the talking to bank rep). Thanks @_date: 2013-11-04 03:48:01
I got it verified in about 3 minutes or less. I put in my account info and let Coinbase do the trick. I am not really concerned with anything happened to my account, I rarely keep a high balance there.

Makes BTC look like it is dominated by paranoid libertarians.  That won't help move things along.

So...that price per coin...is it going down anytime soon?
