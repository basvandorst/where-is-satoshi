You sound a bit simple.
Maybe you can understand this:
if this bozo had put his Credit Card PIN number &amp; all other details up on google drive, 
would it have been the credit card suppliers' fault?
The malfunction was between the chair &amp; the computer,
as is (obviously) yours.

You simply grab the QR code on a phone app, [Bread]( (used to be Breadwallet) for example.
I remember thinking " it can't be this easy", ...it is!
Obviously send it to your hard wallet when you get home.

Decisions, decisions!
Get a Ledger nano S.
You're welcome.

People have alts with good reasons.
Say you're on a woodworking sub &amp; you've proudly posted pics of your front door, gate, boat.
Would you have all this IRL info connected to your crypto interests?
THINK about it!

Please don't take this the wrong way
are you drinking?
@_date: 2017-10-30 13:12:30
firstly In my last comment I honestly meant no offence.
(I like a drink myself sometimes)
"BTC fits with radical ideology. Interested in your counterpoints. Thank you."
I don't know which particular ideology you mean, but i'm guessing here would be represented pretty much all sorts and none.
The vast majority I would guess are average people that see their wages in FIAT currency devaluing and are pissed off by it, would you call that a radical?
yes, I know what Ad hominem means.

I am sure everyone is shitting their pants right now.

"BTC was designed to be politically subversive. Wages aren’t changing."
You may be over thinking it,
it's a tool, no single tool (since the flint)  has ever fulfilled the functions of every tool available.
As with all tools, try &amp; see it for what it is, rather than what you'd imagined it to be.

I am, thanks
early days yet.

I agree, there is ample evidence they will play dirty. 
(spoofing, misdirection, coercion &amp; outright lies).
I'm sure core are aware they might try some three-way attack alternating the bcash hashrate/eda nonsense.
They have shamelessly scammed their bcash useful idiots to be cannon fodder.
[This is the conversation I imagine going on in the SW2X bunkers right now.](
As obviously absurd as their "plot" looks, it is never good to underestimate an opponent.
