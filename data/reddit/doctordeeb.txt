This would be nice:) but this ain't no dictatorship, its a big ol' community with a group consensus (well I hope it is)

I was an average joe crypto investor at one point in time and reddit was such a great, friendly, and quick way to enter the cryptoworld (more research was def needed before money was thrown down)

memes to combat memes, I love it

sweet subs, I'll check them out for sure. I just am worried about the average joes/jens who want to get involved with the bitcoin community but only see the "meme" side or the "anti-BCH" side of bitcoin. That is a big turn off if I'm trying to convert my fiat living into crypto living

Lool yea I know thats lame but ive been browsing/lurking reddit for a couple of years and only had the courage to take more of an active role in the community

Lol ikr but I am just glad more eyes are exposed to Bitcoin when reuters busts out the "new all time high"

i wonder if anyone is working on an awareness campaign that uses crowdfunding to have a bunch of digital billboards that say buy bitcoin
