Nice point, thank you! There is a bit less life in the ETH/BTC products but it definitely allows trading with smaller values.

Thank you for your answer. Yes, I did check Coinbase out but their fees make it very hard (probably impossible) to get anything out of it. Buying at $1.99 means that you are paying $0.99 fees and get only $1.00 worth of BTC so I'm hoping that there are other options.

Basically I had some coins from using the idle resources of my server for mining, worth about $25, then instead of cashing it out I added $30 to check out trading, but on GDAX I would need at least $100 in a single currency to be able to trade. In this range using Coinbase would be very hard as only huge price changes would make it worth trading after the fees. If it's not possible I might as well send the remaining $70 to Coinbase next month so I can turn the coins around but I hoped I could find an exchange with lower entry points.

Yeah, this is getting out of hand. SEPA transactions don't process that quick.

It's not about being smart, I consider rocket scientists smart however they don't necessarily know how insecure and outdated email is by default, in fact most people probably have no idea about the possibility of spoofing emails. They don't care about illogical statements or grammar errors, it even fits the "random russian/asian hacker kid who barely speaks english and has an accent" and "bitcoin is a virtual money for illegal things" image, they see an email from their own address and they are instantly cornered. Some of them might ask a friend and dodge the bullet, others might panic and pay the fee right away. If you check the various BTC addresses associated with these emails you will see the sad reality of just how much money they can make with this scam. Only way to help is to report the abuse at the server &amp; domain provider and if you ever set up a mail server make sure it is secure and properly configured to reject these bullshits in order to protect your customers.

The Bitcoin twitter and the Bitcoin website becoming the perfect example of why we need Bitcoin? A domain name or a twitter account is controlled by someone, bitcoin is not controlled by anyone (usually). Too bad this advertisement only works for people who are already into bitcoin.

It's just an automated system making a mistake, we had it for a few products (vegetables and other food related stuff from a farm). Requested an approval and it went away in minutes. Nothing to do with bitcoin and nothing to see here.
