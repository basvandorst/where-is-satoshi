The bank would still give the money back, throw the account in default for $4500, and charge the account holder the fee.  Plus interest until the account is brought back to good standing.
Which benefits the bank more, turning away a customer or earning a $35 fee plus interest?  That answers the question.

I know you're being sarcastic, but that is absolutely correct.  Bitcoin, USD, Euro, the medium doesn't matter.  OP's problem with his scenario is he has no buffer built in so a minor delay makes him hurt.  That is the risk he takes in running so close to the edge.  It doesn't make his point any less valid, that he should be able to transfer his money without holiday delays since the entire process is automated anyway.

If you take a step back though, what OP is trying to do is a great example of the planning a lot of people do.  If you have multiple bank accounts some will be earning greater interest amounts than others.  In the ideal situation you'd structure your finances so that as much of your money stays in the highest earning account for as long as possible, only transferring the minimum you need to other accounts or even withdrawing for spending cash.  If the banking systems worked by any any definition of logic you could (and should be able to) structure your transfers so it leaves the high-interest account "just in time" to arrive in your other accounts by the time they are needed.  This is what OP was doing, but got caught by an unknown bank holiday.

Sorry I mistook it then.  It is a common strategy.  If you think about a normal household that has an emergency fund, do they keep it in their normal checking account that probably doesn't have interest, or do they keep it in a savings account or money market fund?  Usually the latter, then they transfer it to their checking account when they need to spend it.
