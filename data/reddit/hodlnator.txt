I might be misinterpreting but it appeared as though you were describing simple interest and not compound interest.
I’ll agree if you have enough starting capital there is absolutely no reason to go into ANY risk asset, to include stocks of any kind, much more consertive and you will do fine.
And I don’t think BTC is an “investment” in any classical sense.  But I don’t for a minute dismiss the use case or profit potential it represents.
Smart conservative investments can of course be a consistently successful strategy.
Different objectives and I’ll leave it that.

Ok, by that logic if I buy a gold coin and pay $100 for it, then gold increases in value and I sell it for $200 then gold is a Ponzi scheme, is that your position?
I know what your response will be, “but gold is something real, something tangible, it has intrinsic value”, am I right?
No, you know what is sad is that at this point in time we still have people in this subreddit so uninformed and ignorant of bitcoin that they could call it a Ponzi scheme. Ponzi schemes deal with complete fraud, the underlying good or service is a shell, there is NO substance, no value.
Here is the value of bitcoin, it’s immutable, meaning incontestable, it is descentralized, very divisible and easy and cheap to transfer.  You don’t have to ask anyone permission to buy it or transfer it to another person.
Here is the scenario, I have a friend in Venezuela and he and his family are struggling to survive, I have some extra dough so I want to give him $7000.  (I am using dollars just for ease of example really I want to transfer “units of value” to him).  Going through a bank to do an international wire is incredibly difficult and expensive, (I know from experience) you will spend no less than 20 minutes on the phone being questioned and forced to justify “why” and triple verify identity and then do it all again, it will take days to go through, and you will pay around $300 or more to transfer that amount.  $300 would keep my friend and family alive for a month, it’s a tragedy for the banks to extort that amount.  Why do I need to justify to anyone or explain to anyone why I want to give my money to my friend?  I don’t need to explain to anyone why.
And at any given point the bank on either end might just refuse to transfer/accept the wire, or freeze it aka steal it.
Enter bitcoin, I can send my friend $7000 in bitcoin, in a matter of minutes and for next to nothing in fees, probably under a dollar.  AND I DONT HAVE TO ASK PERMISSION or explain or prove anything to anyone.  That’s the value.  
And you see, price is irrelevant to us, it doesn’t matter if I have to send one bitcoin at $7000 or 7000 bitcoin at $1.  
Bitcoin is the most elegant and efficient system for exchange in existence.  It’s the most significant development in transaction of value in 5000 years, maybe in human history.
Ponzi scheme...naw, naw man that’s so ridiculous, it’s cartoonish.

Yeah, it’s a common thing to use known information, patterns, account for unknowns and then ascribe a % chance to something.  Like for instance, if you flip a coin and could say, there is about a 50% chance it will land with a specific side facing up.  Technically I’m just making that number up because there is a minuscule chance the coin could land on its edge, or be struck by lightening in the air, vaporized and never land.  Those possible outcomes are so remote as not to be considered in my 50/50 hypothesis.
Most folks are taking the information that they know.  One piece being the organization submitting/backing the ETF proposal, the CBOE.  That increases the likelihood of approval ie, increases the % chance of approval....wait a minute, did you really need all that spelled out, do I need to continue showing you each piece of known data that would bring someone to the estimation of 90% likelihood of approval??? Naaaw, you’re jerking my chain, right?  Anyway, yeah we’re just making it up.

Or not as good as people are making it out to be?  That it’s a lie?  That it would be good if somehow it was done differently but it’s not so it’s bad?  Ridiculous!!!  
Here is what is happening, Starbucks will allow people to walk in, use BTC, make a transaction and get a coffee.  Period.  And it doesn’t matter one fuck how many times it’s converted hither tither and yon back and forth between fiats, cryptos, gold, oil, virgin peacock oil...it’s just BTC to coffee, and in general a good thing for our space.

Getting us out of gold and silver was a trick.  The governments issued gold and silver money first, then slyly used paper, base metals to issue the physical money but backed it with gold, it was redeemable in gold, finally they slipped the gold right out from under us.  Now it’s just paper and electronic digits.  By the time this happened the quantities of the metals needed for large transactions had become physically prohibitive and the daily liquidity needed really requires a technological solution...fiat IS more liquid, but now there is BTC, problem solved!

Negative ghostrider,  My post was a response to the comment that banks are good for people and only bad for people that can’t manage money, which is absolutely sophomoric and myopic not to mention, categorically incorrect.  It’s a goofy assed comment.  
Banks are not necessarily good for people and the people they are bad for are not necessarily bad money managers.
It wasn’t a stand alone comment, it can’t be evaluated as one.  It was a response to a previous statement.
Banks do offer a service but they do it with a power and at a cost disproportionate to the services rendered.  Not all banks are bad, agreed.  But in general they have the power and capital to rape the piss out of their customers if they choose to.  Not all other businesses or corporations enjoy the same level of impunity.
Using the term “enough said” after a simple statement or word alludes to the simple statement inherently representing the larger argument, without having to write out or repeat the entire thing.  Wells Fargo as a bank was very bad for very many people.
Wells Fargo creates thousands of erroneous accounts, charged ridiculous fees and penalties, conned customers into overpriced and unnecessary insurance products and repossessed deployed service members cars and home which is illegal.  
And you know the term “buzzword” IS A BUZZWORD.  Using it to ridicule another buzzword is a negative feedback loop.  I didn’t use any buzzwords, my comment was as you say, mundane.

Hey OP, I enjoyed that, I didn’t think it was pretentious or judgmental at all.  It was a nice little cross section of everyday folk from which one can glean an idea of general knowledge of the subject among the people.  Cool ��

Here is just a brief article illustrating what happens ALL the time.  A decision to add or remove people/issues/events from curriculums as a matter business as usual of state run education.  In this case the decision to remove Helen Keller from all curriculum might not seem a big deal but the decision to remove “Japanese Imperialism”.as a “cause” of WWII is a pretty good example of state controlling what people should “think” about historical events and issues.
@_date: 2019-01-24 14:57:15
Absolutely correct!!

Damnit, you make a compelling argument that is filled with careful analysis and thought.

When one anthropomorphizes price movements they are actually consciously or unconsciously referencing the fact that price movements (bullish or bearish) are in a large part the result of human behavior...one could argue that even “bot” influence is human driven at its source but that’s a longer discussion.  The poster could have easily just said “lots of humans want this bull run”

That’s total bullshit, the CBOE wouldn’t even touch anything that was as certain to fail as you’re claiming.  So you think the CBOE submitted a proposal they know is going to fail or are you saying that you know more and better than the CBOE?  That’s ridiculous nonsense

Credit card rules are made by the underlying card company, so MasterCard, visa, Amex make the rules usually not Usaa, at least that’s the way I understand it.  And yes USAA has been linking to Coinbase for at least a year maybe two.  It’s nifty but it does throw all your account balances/crypto balances right into your USAA account page.

You’re applying the wrong economic models to the asset.  Price discovery is a process of supply and demand.  In many many assets supply is an estimate in BTCs case the only estimate that is variable is demand.  By very readonable models BTC is wildly undervalued, even at 20k.  By most practical AND empricle models, BTC is no where near a bubble.  It’s just not, speculative?  Of course, bubble, no.
