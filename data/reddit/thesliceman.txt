Actually it highlights the utility for all person to person transactions, similar to cash. Donations to another random person on the internet falls into that category.


Well Bitcoin is digital cash, if you are using it with a vendor, you wont use it with that vendor unless he has a built in escro service, like, for example, The Silk Road had.
Your problem is that not every merchant can be trusted. There is another post in here of a guy who got false charged on his credit card half a dozen times by merchants who couldnt be trusted. Merchants who cant be trusted is a constant. That doesnt go away when you stop using Bitcoin.
Furthermore, how long do you think these hypothetical merchants who take money but dont deliver the service will stay around in the marketplace for?


What Im reading is that Credit Cards are better than Bitcoin for bilateral transactions because people can rip you off. 
That just makes no sense considering how often we have credit card fraud. With Bitcoin, a merchant can rip you of one time by not delivering a promised service. With Credit Cards, a merchant, and anyone else who gets a hold of your CC info, can keep ripping you off until you cancel the card.
One seems far superior if you are worried about security than the other.

So thats like 2 bucks a day if Im doing 28 transaction a day. Or 4 bucks a day if the btc price doubles, which I expect it to.

Okay heres what happened.
I transfered .01 BTC from one wallet to my Blockchain Wallet and received .01 BTC.

But then when I click on the transaction in the Blockchain app, it says under "fee" , "0.0002 BTC".

They are independent in number value.

Blockchain app
@_date: 2014-03-12 20:17:01
I dont use it for retail much, but I use it for tipping online content creators almost everyday.
Its fun, easy, and is a way for me to give back.
I think the right way to do this is, just like a bank account, have 2 (or more) wallets. One is a savings account, and one is a checking account.
The savings obviously has your main holding in it and depending on how much you have, is either in cold storage or a respected exchange.
The checking has all the coin in it that is your spending cash. This wallet is your Blockchain Wallet on your phone.
I keep about 10$ worth of coin in my Blockchain Wallet and use it for tipping whenever I come cross the opportunity to. And when I run out, I buy another 10 or 20$ worth of coin into my savings and transfer it into my checking.
If someone somehow were to steal my phone and knew my pin to get into my phone and my pin to get into my Wallet, the most I could lose is that 10$. Its perfect.
This method is the best of both worlds. You are still saving your coin but are also spending it.

Cryptocurrencies (of which Bitcoin is the most popular) are the future because they are designed as global internet money.
Right now, Federal Reserve Notes (also known as the Petro-Dollar, more on that in a second)are being used a global internet money, but the Federal Reserve Note was not designed to be used as global internet money. Matter of fact, it was designed before even the idea of a global economy even existed.
Bitcoin is the first truly global currency. The reason it has the ability to be this is because it is backed by a distributed network, not a centralized building/nation/power-structure.
It would be silly to think that money is going to be the same pre and post internet considering the massive change money underwent pre and post printing-press. And the internet is 10 times more disruptive than the printing press.
[What is the petro-dollar?](
From 1913 to the 1960s, The US dollar went from being backed by gold to backed by something else. What else? Basically the answer is that the US's biggest resource is its Military Power. This might sound all conspiracy and crazy but this is known and accepted fact. The CIA "convinced" all the countries in the middle-east (particularly Saudi Arabia) to accept US dollars for its oil in return for the protection provided by the massive US Military Industrial Complex.
This was the creation of the petro-dollar. Federal Reserve Notes went from being backed by gold to backed by oil, essentially.
Unfortunately, the Federal Reserve (the bank that prints dollars) can only print so much before the currency inflates, loses value, and becomes undesirable. The leaders of these oil countries are not stupid and they see this trend. We are just now starting to see them attempt to break away from the dollar. So far only a few have tried, but are destroyed militarily before they can actualize that (Muammar Gaddafi in Libya). Once one successfully breaks off, just like any other stock, the value decreases and it becomes a race for everyone else to get out the fastest. A domino effect ensues and the petro-dollar collapses overnight.
So the options left are the Federal Reserve keeps printing dollars while the US military forces the oil countries to accept dollars untill the currency collapses on itself, OR the oil countries successfully seperate the oil from the dollar and the petro-dollar is no longer backed by anything and collapses. Those are the two most likely options.
Back on point, you dont have to spend all your time researching conspiracy theories and such, but everyone who has money should spend some time learning what kind of money they are invested it. Is it one that is losing value or one that is gaining value. Is it one that likely will lose value or one that will likely gain value?
Somewhat uncomfortable, but important questions.
Bitcoin is not guaranteed to be the currency that replaces the petro-dollar. As for now it looks to be a very likely contender due to its globalized, decentralized, and autonomous nature built for the internet.
That said, in my experience, the best selling point on Bitcoin is actually using it. Once you use it, you see how incredibly better it is than dollars. Your phone becomes your wallet.

Actually not well said.
He makes a "fortune" from starting a 100% grass-roots independent alternative media orgnaization which provides value to people.
You may consider breaking stories on the Bundy Ranch and countless other stories to go viral "snake oil", but many people find it valuable.
Creating value is what creates wealth. What you fail to realize is that value is subjective.
You would have a point if he was promising to provide value one way, but failed to do so (e.i. televangelists, scam investments), and got rich like that, which is borderline fraud. But that is not the case with Alex Jones.

Both the US dollar and Bitcoin are backed by things.
The misconception is that because these things arent tangible that it means they are backed by nothing.
1. The US dollar is backed by, wait for it... the mafia-style forced protection racket of the arab oil nations. In short, its backed by military might. The US government uses the military industrial complex to force arab countries to only sell its oil in dollars, thus giving the dollar value. As you can see, this is a total house of cards that can easily collapse, not to mention unimaginable unethical.
2. Bitcoin is backed by the most powerful digital network known to man, and what goes with that: The promise of an unbiased (math based) public consensus. (no double-spend). Which is something no other technology has ever been able to do.

Dont limit your daily coin to just tipping other redditors. Support the other internet content providers you enjoy daily.
For Libertarians, this is pretty easy as most of the Libertarian internet content providers already accept Bitcoin. But if the ones you like dont, let them know that you want to tip them in Bitcoin and they will adopt. I have done this successfully many times now.

Most of the population is eating the extra cost because they mostly dont have the credit to get well rewarding cards and dont have financial awareness, but I do, so I am in favor of keeping this system instead of a better one where most of the population will end up paying only half of that extra cost, if that, because I am completely impervious to the local economy.

Youre basing the value of gas on a cash price. The value of gas has a cash price, a yen price, and a bitcoin price, which number values are all independent, which makes your analogy invalid.
5$ today might be the same value as 10$ 10 years from now due to inflation, where say the .01 Bitcoin today might be the same value or even less than .01 Bitcoin in 20 years. Same with Yen.
The real quesion isnt "price" because price changes based on currency and time but rather "cost".
If out of those three, the medium of exchange with the lowest cost to the consumer is the one that will win. On top of that, we can go even deeper and consider all the different kinds of cost, (monetary cost, time cost, energy cost). Bitcoin wins all three.
Edit: Also, a last thing you neglected to mention is that getting cash from your bank also has a fee. Sometimes it is a 3$ fee from an ATM machine, sometimes it is the 3$ of gas that you use to drive to the bank. If the gas station accepted Bitcoin, the lowest price would be cash, then Bitcoin, then CC. But the lowest cost to the customer would be Bitcoin easily.

The CC fee here is 2%, Coinbase is exchange cost is 1%, and thats only if they need/want to exchange it. Best case scenario businesses start using it as a currency and then there is no fee at all because no need to exchange. The point was that Bitcoin is better, which it is. Youre grasping at straws.

Over 10 years ago I saw an episode of COPS where a dude with some type of muscular dystrophy or extreme arthritis in his arms and hands was caught behind a 7-11 with paint all over his face huffing paint.
Its was the saddest thing I have ever seen.
The cops approached him and he just told them about how he is disabled and couldnt afford his medication from the doctor so had to resort to huffing paint for pain relief.
There needs to be a silk road for medicine, and if it can prevent one instance like this poor unfortunate man was in, I am 100% behind it.

False.
