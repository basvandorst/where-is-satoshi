If ure worried about 4k u probably shouldn’t be buying BTC.  Not hating, just saying.
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:15:30
Ever hear of gold futures?  Or crude?  Futures dictates spot price, not the other way around.

U may aim for the moon.  But don’t be surprised if u land in uranus.

Because we need an excuse for off chain solutions by third parties that can profit from this deficiency.
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:40:46
Just waiting for the BTC lemming BTFD’ers arrive.  Then reshort and replay.

For the 1% it’s chump change.  Keeps the riff raff and proles away.

I think u are right.  Major sell the news event unfolding.  I have no BTC only alts but fear the whole space is going to get hammered.  Hopefully some whale steps in.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:37:02
You’re right but i think it falls on deaf ears hence the rise of BCH and ETH
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:18:30
Smart BTC holders literally ‘cash’d out
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:37:10
Yeah it’s fine.  We’ll probably correct back to 10k in the coming days
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:53:17
 Nothing like a little flash crash to start the day.  
@_date: 2017-12-04 02:26:40
This time it’s different....
It will burst, it us inevitable.  Nobody knows exactly when or how low but I think the day if reckoning is coming in 2018.  Probably see a price collapse for BTC below 1k someday.
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:26:16
Yeah lets privatize and make Bitcoin into a profit center for corporations!  Yay
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:13:47
The game is to cash out using futures exchange.  They can leave the coins in the exchanges that could not process the billions they owned.  CME and CBOE can let them cash out if they want by selling naked short the contracts since they have the underlying as a covered position.
@_date: 2017-12-21 11:03:51
Each layer more dependencies and centralization.  Dumb analogy.
@_date: 2017-12-15 17:22:13
Bitcoin has become Wallstreet
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:18:22
Really?  How long have u been trading CL or GC?
@_date: 2017-12-04 02:31:09
Simple solution - use the other bitcoin (i dare not speak the name). 
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:07:44
Liquidity is a joke.  I swear my order of 1 single BTC moves the bid/ask, I can see the exchange trading against me.
@_date: 2017-11-21 04:53:41
I think a lot of crypto should investors have not seen a real market crash.
We could be looking at a thousand point + crash tonight.
@_date: 2017-11-14 03:50:31
I doubt it.  I know many retail that have access to futures trading.  Anyone can make an Interactive Brokers account and buy futures.  
First step is futures, next will be Exchange Traded Notes (ETN) on the stock market - followed by the leveraged Ones.  They do buy underlying futures, and will have a strong impact on the underlying asset.
@_date: 2017-11-12 00:58:48
Progress won’t destroy crypto - quite the contrary. 
Like any good economic innovation - destruction is involved.  The current incarnations of crypto will be seen as naive and speculative in a few years.  Objective is to profit as much as u can during this gold rush - as it will definitely end in tears.
@_date: 2017-11-11 19:43:16
Just a little correction.  Probably down to 5000.  Part of normal market mechanics, things don’t always go up. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 11:31:20
The arb can still be done, albeit in cash.  A lot depends on investor psychology - if they accept the futures price to be the true measure of the price of bitcoin, similar to how gold and crude futures lead their respective spot price.
@_date: 2017-11-14 03:44:46
Nobody freakin takes delivery except a small group of commercial parties.  If u have a futures trading account most brokerages force u to roll/close out your positions before expiration.
@_date: 2017-11-17 13:52:06
It’s done like dinner.  Failure to launch still stuck on block 782.  No free lunch, not even a lump of coal.

Forbes contributor is about as credible as a Facebook blog post.  Forbes is losing readers fast because 90% of their contributors are taking their book/stock and now crypto under the guise of a Forbes sanctioned argument.

Lol what the hell.  My ears hurt
@_date: 2017-11-14 03:41:28
Umm its like a group of amateur’s playing poker and inviting the world series winner to play at your table.
This is being added to the CME to let in the sharks to prey on the fish.  Trading for profit will be exponentially more difficult as algorithmic traders take control of the futures contracts (and they will enter the primary market of course).

Money doesnt buy happiness.
Do yourself a favor and rid yourself of material things that can only lead to self loathing and endless cycle of wanting.
Send your coins to me and I’ll carry your burden.
@_date: 2017-11-14 03:38:57
Exactly.  The derivatives as a proxy will dictate the price of the underlying.  Bound to happen once it trades on futures.  Welcome to max pain.
@_date: 2017-11-26 06:45:14
This is bullish for Bitcoin Cash.  The aggregate $ for both forks is still money invested in Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 00:49:29
I use IB and totally agree with this.  It’s nuts for them to take the counter risk - how can they collect on margined futures leveraged 100 times.  The way Bitcoin moves, they will have to quadruple their staff handling margin calls.
@_date: 2017-11-12 00:06:26
BTC is not under attack - this is just evolution of Bitcoin, and it looks like BCH is next in line for the throne.  Let the markets decide which will be the dominant coin.
@_date: 2017-11-16 00:50:40
I hope they do this soon.  It may demonstrate that small txs simply dont work as unconfirmed tx’s stack up into the hundreds of thousands.
@_date: 2017-11-14 03:55:42
As an investor I have experience trading futures (mostly CL, GC, ES).  There is utility for commercial hedgers (oil producers/consumers buying hedges) but not for Bitcoin.  It will be purely speculative - a back door for Wall St to get in on the action.

Netscape was a cool browser..  and the Amiga was a great PC.   Yet things evolve...
@_date: 2017-11-17 19:30:45
Money going into BCH while BTC near ATHs. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 19:58:45
Want to see this go to at least $5800 before buying any BTC
@_date: 2017-11-11 19:59:45
Yeah, i think $5800 is in the cards for a test - probably overnight
@_date: 2017-11-12 01:01:20
Next week it will be $4000 and BCH over $2000
@_date: 2017-11-11 19:34:45
Same here
@_date: 2017-11-17 13:42:54
Dead on arrival. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 12:43:45
Like the axiom, he who has the gold makes the rules.  Right now the guys with the gold are going to BCH
@_date: 2017-11-14 03:36:05
Wait till BTC price movement is pinned and restricted due to contract expiration or hedge unwinds whilst volume explodes clogging the network.
This may be good to legitimize bitcoin to the mainstream but it is the end of the free (chaotic) bitcoin market.  More volume, less volatility, less wins for retail while bankers arbitrage and front run every cent out of every trade.  Welcome hedge fund algos with billions at their disposal.
@_date: 2017-11-15 01:54:10
So yeah - all the crypto hippies touting how Bitcoin is so great because it is decentralized, anti-fin establishment.  Well we’ve come full circle, and soon enough it’s success will be the end of all the ideals it was supposed to espouse.  Either way I’m more or less indifferent but it’s amusing to say the least.
@_date: 2017-11-11 13:05:46
Depends on your positioning.  I’m mostly in LTC and ETH.  My goal is to increase my coin count.  I’ll swap some coins for BTC every time it goes down 10%.  I got the feeling BTC will fall to around $5000 shortly
@_date: 2017-11-14 12:22:30
Can’t wait to see what these posters will be saying when the price of BCH surpasses that of BTc
@_date: 2017-10-26 00:42:59
Diversify into Litecoin.  Bitcoin forks will be the end of it.  Mom and pop folks will never accept BTC as crypto currency of choice if this continues.
@_date: 2017-10-27 21:30:49
Whatever happened to that trash Newsweek journalist that brought havoc to Dorian?  Did she ever apologize?
@_date: 2017-10-26 00:38:16
Exactly.  Litecoin has no drama - I think more people will gravitate there.  Stable prices and centralized leadership.
@_date: 2017-10-20 16:03:52
Hedge and convert some to LTC.
