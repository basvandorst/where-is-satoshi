Bitcoin (or any crypto) is not a millionaire factory, you are going to lose money at some point and win in other. This is not something you invest and wait until it tenfolds (unless we are in 2011) think of distributing your wealth in more than one form. It will probably will be a LOT better than having that money catching dust in your bank account anyways.

can you import a bip38 private key in bitcoin-cli? or do you need to decrypt it using external software first?
@_date: 2018-02-28 18:06:13
Ok, fisrt you have to know where are your binaries now, that could be `/usr/bin/bitcoin/` or `/usr/local/bin/bitcoin/` or something entirely else depending on your distro or how you installed it, you can always use the search feature to search the `bitcoin-cli` binary. Then you go to the folder where the downloaded binaries are e.g. `~/downloads/bitcoin-0.16.0/bin/` and copy its contents to the file where the binaries where. If they were in the first option then you would need to do
`sudo cp * /usr/bin/bitcoin/`, the * means everything in your current location so be sure to do this while in the directory of the downloaded binaries. Tell me if it does work.
*edit*: Do you remember how you installed it previously?

`bitcoin-core/bin`? whats the complete path?  `~/bitcoin-core/bin/`? 
Yes you understood correctly, you only have to replace the 5-6 binaries and thats all, you just have to make sure you are replacing the binaries that your current installation is using and not some random binaries that you may have copied redundantly before by error. It sounds that you have them installed in your home folder (which may be the case).

The biggest problem, (at least in math) is that even if we have the arXiv, where most actual papers are published for free, the math that holds it altogether was written a long time ago. Those authors are long dead and sometimes there is no way of getting those articles without paying to some obscure publisher, without Sci-Hub is very hard to get access to anything that has more than 50 years.

You turn on bitcoin-qt and it starts syncing with the blochchain. If you are on a decent pc with a decent connection it will be ready in about 10 hours (Do not try it on a raspberry) then you are ready to use it. In subsequent uses you only need to download the lattest blocks, which is fast (around 100-150mb per day since the last sync). 
Edit: the shitty part is that the blocks are downloaded and **verified**, that uses a lot of cpu/ram in the initial sync.

The balance of one address isn't showing in electrum using the personal server :c (the tx that funded the address was made more than 2000 blocks ago). But it is shown in the bitcoin core client. BTW it **IS** posible to run bitcoind and bitcoin-qt in the same machine with different users, just using `-connect`on the qt node and diferent wallets or `--disablewallet` in the bitcoind node.. I had to use `prune=550` + `blocksonly=1` on the qt instance to reduce the size of the bitcoin directory to 3.5gb on the second instance.
@_date: 2018-04-02 21:33:46
I think the DDOS vulnerabilities should be fixed on the client (e.g. LND) you shouldn't have to implement a weird setup using VPNS/tor/whatever. What I recommend is not running anything with port forwarding on your user.

@_date: 2018-01-25 15:49:55
These kind of initiatives promote nodes with hundreds of nodes connected which centralizes the network about them, while it is fine as it is if this conduct becomes the norm the network will suffer from centralization. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 00:45:19
1MB won't do it for the long run, but we are fine with it until this kind of solutions appear.

This is great. It does look a little overwhelming even tho most items are very simple. Two question: If I want download/check the blockchain on main main pc, how do I send it to the Pi? just copy paste in the correct folder?  If I want to use, say  prune=550, do I need an external HDD, what are the advantages of doing so?

according to the link posted by c-lighting can be run using pruning. 
@_date: 2018-01-24 14:02:41

@_date: 2018-01-27 03:30:43
well then I need another word, even if they have no control the fact that a few random disasters, ISP censorship, etc could greatly harm the connectivity of the LN by removing less than 1% of the nodes is a reason to worry.

@_date: 2018-01-25 16:34:00
In this case opening a channel with the 'other' node will have a fee associated whereas this one will be 'free'. Don't get me wrong I am ultrahyped with LN but it could become centralized if bad decisions/practices are made.
@_date: 2018-01-25 16:29:32
yes it is, at least it is easy to do, the only non-trivial thing to do is the port forwarding.
@_date: 2018-01-31 11:58:36
Losing money is the least concern now, one assumes that if you use LN over the mainet that money is lost already (for now). The last thing BTC needs now is bad press, so prefer testnet for now. Don't waste time in the mainnet until the devs are in a better position or at least when they stop telling ppl to avoid testing in mainnet.
Remember LN first version was released like 2 hours ago and the devs have their hands full only with bugs from the pre-test pre-alpha version, give them some time to breathe.

@_date: 2018-01-26 12:18:29
Did they install the client(s)? I see you did not use a segwit wallet also. I do agree that using LN is even easier to use than most BTC wallets once installed, a steep in the right direction.
@_date: 2018-01-22 17:39:14
thanks!! I just want to know if there is any advantage of using an external disk using prune, does running a node causes too much wear to the sd card?
@_date: 2018-01-31 12:09:33
If you want to support the decentralization of the Lightning network, please use/test LND's autopilot feature it connects you to fairly well connected nodes and also avoids the hubs. While those hubs don't actually control anything it, the only concrete thing we can do to help the network is to build a more robust network that has a better connectivity (see  for actual definition) and require less hops between any pair of nodes. It is a fact that the more those hubs are used, the more hops there will be between the farthest nodes in the network. 
To get an idea go to  , change the option to Viva (fixed) and start moving the HUBs outside of the center, you will notice that they already have an important % of the edges (channels) of the network.

Can someone tell me whats the deal about Bech32? It is better than a Segwit address?
@_date: 2018-01-31 11:52:39
Thanks for the explanation, I wish I could give it more than one upvote. Two questions:
When you say lower fees compared to the actual SegWit addresses (P2SH), do you have any estimate?. Or more concretely, what percentage of the size of a SegWit P2SH does a Bech32 transaction require? 80%? 90? 95%?
You say that actual SegWit (P2SH) is compatible with vanilla addresses, does that mean that Bech32 is not? i.e. I can't do a direct transactions between a vanilla address and a Bech32 one?

You can just set a node on your main pc, it does not have to have full uptime. It doesn't use that much resources 
@_date: 2018-01-27 00:39:34
You don't benefit from it. Assume  for a moment there are 5 hyper connected, call them A, and a group B of 100 nodes that connect to a single node from A. Then you could need up to 11 hops to get from one of node of B to another, thats bad. Asume now you have 100 nodes, every one connected to 5 nodes, if you think it for a moment, you would need somewhere between  3 and 4 hops to reach any node.
Of course these are very specific examples and far away from reality, but it does makes one think.
edit: the examples assume some things about the topology of the network, but you can get an idea.
Remember that the ultimate goal is to get the minimum amount of hoops between any pair of nodes, right now if you remove ALL the nodes that are only connected to a single hyperconnected node, the connectivity in the network will increase and the amount of hoops will decrease.
@_date: 2018-01-31 12:25:14
Showing that something 'somewhat' works is not better than waiting for it to work and then show it to the world, the reason Bitcoin is still relevant is the fact that it does not rush things, if not we would be already be using 8mb blocks.

I will give you the answer that workes for me (my OS), but it depends on your OS.

There is nothing wrong with electrum and samurai, you can't expect everyone to download/verify the whole blockchain. In a perfect satoshian world the average I-don't-know-how-to-reset-my-router-user doesn't even need to know what the blockchain is.
