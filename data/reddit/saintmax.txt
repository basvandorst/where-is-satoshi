For over a year I held like a guardian and at near the very bottom I was forced to sell due to a need for cash. Since then I haven’t had a single spare cent to put back in and I’ve just been watching it rise for months. So fucked up

Yes but the implication is that if Binance has a user that is moving tousands of BTC that can be traced to a known criminal wallet, it had better quadruple check their kyc to make sure they know who they're dealing with.

I don’t know if this is not completely true. And even if most of the surface has been mapped, not  every square inch has been personally investigated by humans. And if it has, maybe not in recent history and things change quite often. And on top of that, much of the interesting parts of the earth to explore are currently underground, which *definitely* has no not been 100% mapped. So there is lots to see and discover.

Wording is kind of vague. He says “justifies a higher price” meaning that if there was a price increase then it is not for nothing. Says nothing about the justifications for a lower price. He is just saying it is justified as an asset because it is a working novel technology. Basically exactly the opposite of what warren buffet says 
@_date: 2018-08-27 17:38:40
I would argue that the fundamentals have changed a lot. The BTC code hasn’t changed that much, but now you can buy bitcoin on your cell phone with a Wells Fargo account where before you could only buy it on a magic the gathering site. And now the market is not just driven by the tech fundamentals of bitcoin but by the tech fundamentals of over 1000 coins and tokens all with development teams. Also fundamentally (psychologically), sentiment has changed drastically from viewing crypto as a darknet currency to a tool that could disrupt any industry. The fundamentals of crypto in general are worlds apart.

Yes you’re right, I was thinking of 2011 for mtgox. Sorry. The rest of it still applies.

Yeah except I always cringe when people compare 2018 to 2014. The conditions are so far apart that the similarities in the chart shouldn’t even apply. It’s like comparing an apple that someone found in the trash to an electronic orange with AI that gives blowjobs

According to the last thread, they will never even receive/accept the bitcoin. They will just accept usd via an ewallet that also holds bitcoin.

Are you talking about “spoof” “noob” and “bags”?
Edit:just in case anyone is too afraid to ask haha 
Spoof means a fake buy/sell order, they pull it before it gets filled. Noob is newbie, a newcomer to the field. Bags means your crypto stash. I sometimes take bags to mean coin you’re trying to get rid of or are potentially holding at a loss.

Buying and selling but no moving/sending. Not your private keys, not your bitcoin. But it’s a start :)

Depends what you mean by recently. Fiat currency doesn’t move as quickly as fast as crypto. 
USD has inflated 2200% in 100 years: 
2.8 trillion dollars of M1 money USD printed in 50 years: 
Edit: dollars printed has gone from 8 billion to 2 trillion in less than ten years. Less than 10. 
@_date: 2018-10-04 05:12:11
They’re not really *that* comparable, no. But the OP that I was replying to was comparing them (by saying bitcoin was a bubble and usd is not). So I was just playing along and showing evidence of bubbleness in the usd economy. They are comparable in some ways, they’re both traded, they’re both minted, they both have a value relative to other currencies. The set of circumstances that usd lives in doesn’t allow it to be as volatile as btc. It does allow for long term inflation (which is by no means a required effect of an aging currency) so by showing the past history of usd printing and inflation I am showing that there is a small chance that the currency is in a bubble.

Sorry I’m not really super educated on this topic but I tried to do my research. This definition doesn’t include any constraints on time that a bubble can exist in, as long as the perceived value is greater than the intrinsic value, it can be a bubble. 
“An economic bubble or asset bubble (sometimes also referred to as a speculative bubble, a market bubble, a price bubble, a financial bubble, a speculative mania, or a balloon) is trade in an asset at a price or price range that strongly exceeds the asset's intrinsic value.”
From:  
Here’s one from nasdaq: A market phenomenon characterized by surges in asset prices to levels significantly above the fundamental value of that asset. 
None of the definitions I found characterize bubbles as a thing that has to happen quickly. And also If you look at the charts i posted you’ll notice and extreme spike in both of those metrics over the last ten years. Id day that’s a fairly short time line.

Haha I thought the article was nice but also kind of sad. Basically saying “all the biggest players and companies in the world are buying and investing in crypto yet the market still took a 70% tumble this year”.

In the banking industry this happens more than anyone could ever imagine and has prompted one of the largest industries in the world (the insurance industry) just to counter the scum fucks stealing from innocents. 
I do agree that many crypto companies will settle somewhere in the middle of decentralization and centralization. 
One example is a company Called MetalPay which created a venmo type app for USD and crypto. Right now the app is completely centralized with the company holding private keys, but in return, all accounts on their platform are FDIC insured by a bank. This is the first I’ve heard of insured crypto accounts. They plan on creating a hub for more decentralized-focused users to manage heir own accounts. 
@_date: 2018-10-27 08:01:40
Man people fucking suck. Any tiny opportunity to be a scum fuck and screw someone’s life over and these people will do it without question for a penny. And there’s thousands of them. Every corner of the cryptosphere is filled with scammers and con men. I know it’s basically like this in every industry that deals with money and info but fuck man it makes me mad and sad. Fuck some people.

Wherein investors speculate that the value of the company or asset will rise or fall *based on past earnings or current events affecting it*. In Bitcoin we speculate based on how many people we think will fomo or panic sell. There are still fundamentals but as someone said, we are mostly speculating on human psychology as an above comment or said. 
@_date: 2019-02-06 10:58:36
Notice they specifically left out the word scalable. They didn’t say it would be able to function as part of a large global economy. They said it would be a scarce and immutable, decentralized currency. There is a difference between that and some currency that might replace dollars and euros.

My contributions: 
Bitcoin is the first ever decentralized currency, giving operating power to its participants instead of its founders. 
Bitcoin can be accessed or transferred anywhere in the world so long as you can connect to the internet. 
A Bitcoin transfer from Peru  to Zimbabwe is as easy as a transfer between you and your neighbor. 
Though bitcoin is digital, it is nearly impossible  to attack or hack it without immense technological resources. It has not yet suffered a successful direct attack.

That part I understand. I was there for the debate and the ensuing split. What I don’t get is this photo in particular. Why are they showing BTCs white paper and saying that it’s BCH?
Edit: also What you say is up for debate. BTC can still be used as a peer to peer payments platform. It might be slow and expensive but it’s still true to the white paper.

Coinbase is an exchange. Most cold wallets do not have even 1% of the risk factor of even the best exchanges.
@_date: 2019-05-21 00:26:24
Depends what exchange you’re using but yes most have withdraw fees. Coinbase pro does not so I use that for most btc trading. For other coins it might be more difficult. For 100 you’re probably fine. Its not going to cripple you. But if it’s just sitting on the exchange and you plan on hodling it anyway, I’d pay the $2 or whatever to hold it in a cold wallet
