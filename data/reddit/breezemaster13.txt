Insider trading. There is no insider trading in a decentralized marketplace! Do you understand that? That if you were my best friend and I worked at CB and I knew what was up next, you bet I would call you for sure and tell you to stock up and there isn't shit anyone can do about it! Unregulated. Decentralized. All the issues you have problems with are not issues because the unregulated decentralized foundation allows for it.
You think we would have hit 20k or even 10k as fast as we did without Coinbase? No way. Can you deny that the exposure and ease of access Coinbase provides has propelled Marketcap to this point? You are right, we would have made it without CB - they aren't the heart of the system by any means, but they helped get us here, fast. 
I don't mean to sound Coinbase mega stoked. I'm not. I would expect CB to do what is best for their company bottom line. If that means siding with people who try to reck Bitcoin I wouldn't be surprised. They are about the money, not the value or functionality. But I think they were significant in getting Bitcoin and Crypto in general to this point so quickly.
All in all, thank you. I understand and respect your point and view.

In America, there is a fee if you use another banks ATM (not sure what country you are from, but whatever.)  You want over 500$ in cash? You best get to the bank before 5 or 6 P.M. because your 24 hour ATM limit won't allow over a certain limit. 
It's revolutionary because its revolutionary. Just because you burned through your monthly allowance and are sitting on the sidelines getting in tune with your feelings or whatever doesn't mean I don't know what I am talking about.

Bro on every page of this sub, you will find at least one post by a bro who got hazed fucking around with shitcoins trying to day trade. If 1 or 2 or even 10 people felt the burn, thats one thing, and I would take my chances alongside you. But when thousands of people lost enough to individually write essays about it on Reddit so the next guy might avoid the same fate, its significant. The exchanges are owned by the liquidity whales provide, and in return, they get advantages normal folk don't know exists. Plus, the exchanges are filled with fuckin robots programed to manipulate the price alongside our human emotions. If you can beat R2D2 or Data in math, then by all means, have at it. Just know you are going up against a bunch of insane smart robots that have 0 emotions and are programmed to trigger your emotions into selling coin. A very tough battle with an ending that will lead to an awkward conversation with your spouse about that one conversation you had a while back green lighting daytrading. Good luck bro, but please hodl.

Thats it. The real bottom line...
When you own Bitcoin you and only YOU have total control of your money. No 9 to 5 rush to the bank before close, no credit lookups to qualify people into tiers or groups, no ATM / wire / overdraft / bank fees. No rules telling you when or how much of your money you are allowed to transfer. Nothing, but total freedom and control of your $.
Honestly, its revolutionary when you look at it, big picture. Your money, when you want it, 100% in your control.

The point was that banks group clients into platinum members, gold, silver, ect and accommodate them at different standards (nothing to do with credit or financing, didn't mean to mislead you)... You are not actually in full control of your money when it is in the bank. You have to adhere to the banks rules and regulations; for instance documenting cash withdrawals &gt; 10k, no longer allowing cash deposits to unaffiliated accounts, and other regulatory controls of the sort. 
What if your mom had an emergency, needed X $ asap... but the site was down for maintenance? In that situation, you are not in control of your own $ and would not be able to access it on a moments notice. 
Bitcoin allows you to control 100% of your $, 100% of the time.

Probably because they hold our funds for days, force us onto their ridiculously fee infested platform, put points behind all coin prices when selling coins to customers, take points from coin prices when customers sell coins for fiat, and essentially control our access to our funds.

I HODL because I think the value will increase in time better than any other investment I can make right now \(minus real estate\). I can't prove it and I can't show why I have this mentality; it's just my gut feeling over what the tech and Bitcoin stands for as a whole. I could be wrong, but I'm saving my $ in crypto rather than a bullshit big bank savings account. 
I do agree with your point though. It's not fast enough to buy things with just yet. Hopefully, it'll get better as the tech develops.

The Rial \(their currency\) has dropped 50&amp; or so in the past few months, so crypto would be a logical move. However, things are really hard in Iran \(have been for years\), and with the new sanctions coming up, it'll get even harder. That ridiculous regime has a strong bind over the people, not only economically but particularly psychologically as well. Last I checked, Bitcoin was selling for about 1.5x on localbitcoins for Iran. However, you'd have to be pretty savvy with respect to IT because the f'n mulahs have pretty much tried to ban the entire internet to the people.
One would have to have a legit knowledge of VPN's while maintaining security and shit, and to most people, it's probably not worth the risk. When President Trump made his announcement, the first thought that came to my mind was "how do I get Bitcoin to my friends over there." For them to sell it, it would be risky I think, so I put the idea on ice until the dust settles.
I wish them \(the people of Iran\) the best through these hard times. It's ALWAYS darkest before dawn, but they are a resilient, educated, and clever bunch.

Banks have realized that Bitcoin is going to mega turbo haze their establishment. They are going to do whatever they can to destroy and cripple Main St. adoption of Bitcoin and Crypto.
No one can tell you where or when you can spend or send your Bitcoin. Crypto gives us full autonomy of our funds. To me, thats the factor that really makes it awesome! The banks are doomed and they know it.

@_date: 2019-06-04 09:49:05
Bro, you nailed it, but everytime someone brings up the obvious, (that this market is just a big fungoo) a bunch of knuckleheads start nerfing him saying "you must be new to bitcoin, don't you know it's volatile" or "just another healthy correction, stay strong." Even Hellen Keller could see that's garbage. The momentum that looks so surreal, shooting up millions of dollars at a time, seems that way because it is. This guy uses robots that are programed to act on peoples trades, in conjunction with manipulating them to their psychological limits. At then end, he takes it all and no one knows who he is or where he's from because it's crypto and thats how it works.
The past few weeks were all a fungoo. The same person took the same money and started moving it around, in and out, creating the notion that there was a spike in volume and liquid was being injected into the market. The underlying effort was to awaken the people who have been holding their bags since 2017, and once the media started yapping and making it seem like the dreams of Bitcoin riches could have another shot at coming to fruition, it was already over. Today's event has been on repeat over the past few weeks (just look at the charts) while BitMex has made over 700m dollars (that number isn't accurate, I think it's more) along side Bitfinex, and whoever owns this market as well. I'm surprised Coinbase hasn't joined in on the margin fuckfest, probably cause they are in the US but I'm not sure. 
Anyway, there is nothing anyone can do about it. If you just made 15m in an hour, you think you're ever gonna give that game up and walk? To answer your question, the 1 thing bitcoin does have going for its future is that there are a finite # of coins. Once that time comes, the fate of Bitcoin will be in the hands of the people to decide if they are going to keep the whale alive or let him starve. If they hold and stay away from margin trading, sooner or later whales stash will begin to dwindle. He won't go down without a war though, you can bet on that. The kicker: this wont happen for another 120 years or some shit and we'll all be long gone by then. Bottom line, if you invest in bitcoin today, you are at the mercy of the manipulator, thru and thru. People will suggest you try and go with the flow and take advantage of knowing that, but that reality is nearly impossible. If the whale lets the price get too high, it jeopardizes his plan because if somehow momentum does actually pick up the way it did 2 years ago, it'll cost him a chunk of his stash to regain control of the market again. I don't expect the price of bitcoin to go too high anytime soon and any momentum that does pick up will be at his discretion. If we get lucky, maybe we can make a few buck here and there. Sorry dude, I don't mean to be a downer, but take a glance at any chart over the past few weeks and decide for yourself. In all honesty, I hope I am wrong.

There is no way Krakens bullshit platform can handle the traffic surrounding the fork. I honestly don't even think Krakens garbage system can hold up 24 hours pre-fork either with out ghosting trades, logging people off, and failing to fill orders.

Coinbase may have up to a 4 hour freeze on trading 2x as well as a 24 deposit/withdrawl hold of both 2x and BTC.

You're gonna get some douche bags on this board who may say stuff like "are you high" or "stupid" or whatever. Ignore them.

For 99.999% of people, making money is and never will be as simple as choosing red / green and then sweating it out for hours glued to the screen.

Banks do whatever they please, and mostly without consequence - mind you these are the same banks that fraudulently created credit card accounts for millions of Americans and that purposely manipulated the order of customer debit and credit ledgers, causing people who live paycheck by paycheck to overdraw. 
When busted, they simply pay millions in negligible fines generated from the scam profits and settle down the herd of lawyers who represent the consumer (who now gets fucked by the bank and the lawyer...DP. That sucks.) 
Bitcoin may be able to give them a run for their money, only time will tell. Justice would be beautiful in this case. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 08:11:05
Bro it depends on what your motivation is. If you're chasing the money en route to become the next teen wolf of bitcoin, its late. 30 BTC would run you 250k. When BTC hits 100k, you've got 3 mil... a great return but thats not big dick by any means. You can research altcoins with the intention of hodling, and you never know, even the sun shines on a dogs ass one day. 
Maybe you see BTC providing a real opportunity for people to actually control their money; not access it from weekdays b/t certain hours, no hidden fees or gimmicks - ever... Maybe you think its incredible how blockchain technology can be when applied to improve real world systems. If this is you, you already know to hodl and probabl have a pretty good idea of where it's going to go.

Correct me if I am wrong, but I understood from the GDAX e-mail that 2x would be frozen from withdrawal or trading for up to 4 hours after the fork, and that deposit and withdraw of both BTC and 2x will be disabled 24 hours before the fork for up to 4 hours post fork. 
The question then becomes, during that possible 4 hour freeze, how much liquid opportunity would be lost if everyone dumps immediately after the fork? 
@_date: 2017-11-12 16:48:52

@_date: 2017-11-02 23:15:39
GDAX has a delay, up to 4 hours post-fork, where trading of 2x AND Credits or Withdrawls of both BTC / 2x will be frozen. 
If that 4 hours of other people dumping packs enough heat to smash 2x shortly after the fork, GDAX may not be the ideal solution.

I still think it'll go way above 50 but I'm not gonna feed the trolls with a &gt;100k prediction plus I think it'll take a long while. Imo, some really bad shit would have to go down for it not to reach 50k in 5 years, but its possible considering the magnitude of disruption Bitcoin presents.

Bro I was super confused. I used the the API auto feature for a few weeks. Some of my coin info was minus an outlandish number or something totally off, fiat was not accounted correctly, and I felt that the app wasn't able to individualize my trades correctly. For example, if I wanted to analyze my margin performance, the app didnt (or at least I didn't know how to get it to) batch them into margin trades that were gained or lost either as a group or individually. I concluded that manually entering them into my phone or whatever was more accurate for my needs, but I wish it would have worked cause its an awesome idea.

Wire into GDAX. 
When you buy from Coinbase, the price of coin is always higher than what the market states by 5% or greater minus the transaction fee. 
If you wire into GDAX (which is Coinbases exchange platform), you avoid that fee and can buy coin at market value. You're bank might charge you a wire transfer fee, but you can be sure of what you'll see on the flip side of your deposit. 
Good luck bro. HODL.

I don't know how much influence it has on fluctuating the price, but I think it has a very positive influence on those who are interested in learning about or getting involved in Bitcoin... hence, aiding in the growth and expansion of Blockchain Tech in the most general sense.  
The thread offers a wealth of knowledge from people who have been into Bitcoin since its inception and who boast a solid understanding of blockchain functionality. More often than not, I notice they are helpful and generous toward answering questions and offering advice; a factor has a surprisingly large influence on helping Bitcoin grow and expand.

Great news! Thats awesome!

No way, but thats totally what he did. Personally, I think it was a pretty big dick move. He goes up there, spats a bunch of shit from his dirty banker thief mouth, facilitates the drop in BTC value and his rats and weasels mop up a bunch of coin well below what was its current value. 
Big picture though, look at Wells Fargo Bank. They are the biggest cocksuckers around. They got busted for manipulating the order in which people charged their account, resulting in millions of $ in over draft fees for their customers. The worst part, the targets of that scam was college students and people who dance around having close to nothing in their accounts... Literally stealing from the poor.
Most recently, Wells Fargo got bent over again opening fake accounts for millions of their account holders. What happened to them? Nothing. They paid some slap on the wrist fine and it went away as if nothing even happened. Seems like most people didn't even notice which really sucks.
All in all, who cares what Dimon did or says? Hopefully Bitcoin can hold on and stay strong, lessening the influence the crooks running big banks have over fucking people over. Other than that, those dudes are untouchable in my opinion and they know it. It's nice to have a big dick.

In that case (with all due respect), I hope you get mega diarrhea 5000 that lasts for eternity, and that your asshole blows up / explodes.

What is the role of a "go do it yourself, you're stupid cause you can't research" hardass on a public forum? 
Oh wait, I get it... You're just a "real world" kinda person. Its your duty to remind everyone that the world isn't nice and that they have to make it on their own and you choose to do it on a public forum... Particularly on a thread that encourages people to engage in a technology that 99% of society is completely clueless about and that 9/10 people will have to seriously dedicate themselves to even gain the slightest grasp of. 
Your mentality helps nobody and accomplishes nothing. Get back to managing whatever dump you manage and don't be a dick.

Friends (real ones at least) don't make money off friends bro. I've hooked up my friends countless times throughout my life, and there has not been one single instance where I made profit. Make money off randoms.

That'll do just fine. Thanks a lot! Take care. Upvote.

You have to give your SSN (and I think your drivers license too) for Kraken to allow or FIAT deposit. You can deposit crypto from another wallet, then sell that into USD on Kraken, but you cant make deposits like you would with a CoinBase USD wallet or something...
About Kraken, if you simply want to buy different coins and trade them at occasional highs and lows then I guess Kraken is pretty simple to use. However, if you like to stake margins and make trades during times of high volatility, when you need the exchange to be responsive and act on your split decisions and hunches hunches in realtime,  then Kraken is the biggest piece of shit around.
Krackens platform (whatever they run their bullshit website on) is total garbage. During times of high volatility, when lots of people are trying to buy and sell positions at the same time, their platform lags becomes and becomes soooo insanely slow, that it sometimes literally just shuts down (like a DDoS attack or something). 
I have had the worst experiences with shithead Kraken because you will get stuck with trades that are 10 seconds  (no kidding) behind. Meanwhile, things are going bananas, you're trying to secure a position, but cant figure out what the hell is really going on as the site jams up, makes you log in again, and fails to respond to your orders on their horseshit system... All the meanwhile, BTC takes a mega dive and your margin position just lost hard cause Krakens platform is fucking lame. 
Recently they had to stop trading some coins because they realized what a piece of this they had, but haven't been able to fix it. Support takes a really long time and they aren't sincere about what shit they have people trading on. Google or search reddit for Kraken and you'll see how other people got hazed too. Beware.

I think most people got the point of the obvious exaggeration.

With all due respect, unless you have an in, don't even consider it bro. I used VPN to access Bitmex and other exchanges and never had an issue. However... I got rekt, went back for revenge, got rekt again, swore I knew it would drop the next time, and got rekt again. Finally learned my lesson. 
If you have the cash to hodl in a margin account so that your bet couldn't possibly liquidate, thats one thing... But even in that case the margin fees would eat away at your principal daily or whatever. 
Personally, I think the exchanges manipulate that shit to liquidate margin traders. Who's gonna do a darn thing about it if they were? Simply my opinion though, no proof. Good luck out there.

It's pathetic how people over analyze and manipulate what Draghi said. He was very clear and simple, and these nitwits come out with 1 btc = 1 btc. Cmon man, wtf?
If I walk into Lambo today with 200,000 Euro, I walk w/ a new car. Same in a week or 2 or ....
Now lets say I walk in with 25 Bitcoin today... In a week or 2, I may need 26 or 24 Bitcoin depending on the flux in price. Wtf is so hard to understand about that point? 
Don't be a cocksucker and manipulate Draghis statement by barfing out useless analogies like 1 orange = 1 orange or some stupid shit like that. It's simple to understand what he meant.
Edit: No personal offense to the posters below, but cmon fellas.

Bro. Then you see those stupid fucks immediately flood the boards with "Just another healthy correction, it's normal" and the best one... "You must be new to crypto you if don't know it happens all the time." My goodness it makes me wanna throw up.
The thing is, it's been happening for the past 4 weeks, clear as a diamond, and nobody seems to notice! What the fuck is that? People are convinced it's normal or something...  just look at the chart. If people  just take 1 look at the chart, even Hellen Keller could see what's going on. Unbelievable. 
When you bring it up these guys downvote and shill their scam and tell you must have lost money on the dip. Lol. Gimme a break. The best part, they are like "Oh when are institutions and banks coming, I heard they are here!" and "ETF." I'm *starting* to think that it's not just the market / price manipulation. It's the entire space. Straight up Jordan Belfort, in my ass telling me he told me so.

No way! This sub used to be so awesome back in the day! For some reason, literally in a flash (or so it seemed to me) all the quality posts stopped only to be replaced by random people who joined up to make a few bucks from the hype.
I'm so happy to see that some of these people have responded to this thread, and that they are in fact still around and doing well. 
Thanks for posting this and bringing out some of the legends who I admired years back. You made my day.

I bet that stupid fuck read it 5 times and still doesn't get it.

Sometimes I honestly don't know if half the people on this sub are just that fucking stupid, or if someone is putting them up to regularly posting shit like this to curve perception. Same with those dumbfucks who flood the board immediately after someone manipulates the market and buys back their own coin at a discount with "just another healthy correction, its normal." They have to be getting put up to that shit right? Fuckin dumbshits. There is so much scam shit in this space that it's incredible.
