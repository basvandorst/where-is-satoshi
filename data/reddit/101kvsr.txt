I spent just under 1700 BTC over two years on a business project. I don't regret the cost. As I learned so much about people, business and humanity. 
Reason I say this, is because I just seen my final statement of accounts for the business and seen the overall BTC cost. I used to cringe at companies getting $30m startup investments for crap, now I just laugh about the prospective and relativity of money and value. What a world we live in today :)

I'd like to see a world where everyone at least has 50% of their net worth tied in Bitcoin and Bitcoin derivatives. The only problem is most people have negative net worth, if this problem was inverted, getting to that goal post would be unimaginably easy.

Personally, I've only used it as a method of payment for high value serious transactions, I normally use fiat or Liberty Reserve back in the day. That's why we have a b-side to our coin preforkers.

Get an LLC to protect yourself and pay the fees/taxes because it may save you a lot of money if something screws up with one of your clients. No license other than a General LLC business license is required to consult with people in relation to BTC and you don’t need any license if you decide to go without an LLC, but would recommend lawsuit insurance if your doing consultations with village outsiders (Idaho is mostly village life, esp. in comparison to SLC, PDX and SEA.)

They’ve been bad for a while. But you don’t just start enhancing your AML process because of the law, because the law doesn’t require you to take a selfie next your ID with a shoe on your head, you enhance it to stonewall withdrawals because of a reason.
That reason could be fraction reserve banking (loss of bank access, hacked or destroyed coins, anything resulting in insufficient funds) or something else

For 1/7 of a Bitcoin, it sounds totally worth it. It’s an industrial use machine. Yeah, I’d expect the stand included, but many people have their own VESA stand system on their desks. 
For 3 Bitcoins, it sounds worth it for a machine that will endure 5-10 years. I’d prefer it to have newer parts however than last generation. 
My company spent like ~150 BTC on Apple computers about 5 years ago, so when you think about BTC, it’s getting more for less, if you aren’t hedging it as future investment and using it as a currency that gains value over time instead of an inflation based currency or long term bond/investment.
However I do regret the idea of ~150 BTC being spent on computers that didn’t last very long, poor quality, yet required due to OS lock-in.

Don’t you understand the early adopter advantage to BTC/BCH/Fork? Today BTC lost $700 while BCH gained $700. I lost nothing nor gained. It’s the only thing that people find interesting within the community, that is, making sure Bitcoin will economically benefit yourself and your associates which you don’t hate. 
A lot of people think multimillionaires live some sort of Hollywood depiction of Knots Landing, when the case is, it isn’t. 
It’s a very internally isolating life where you can’t trust anyone, even your blood, and you have to conduct yourself to some appropriate standard otherwise you feel like you’re making an ass out of your experience and he expected quid pro quo courtesy others grant you in the behavior department. 
I sometimes do nothing other than relax for a few months and try/taste new things, such as flying, tobaccos.  I used to have a very large social presence and network when I was &lt;250k net worth. Those old networks die out, the more you know, as they say... And so, you may get bored after a while and you’re stuck thinking about some ways for some good fun, so you meet some people from your community and make it a bit more spicier. 
Excuse my grammar/structure, I’m intoxicated at the moment.

It’s unusual for a LLP or a Corp to sign a letter like a signature for the name of the company instead of using a stamp or attaching a officer of the entity to sign on behalf of it.

Supply/demand would increase the cost, but that as a base minimum is not great. It should cost a lot more than $1m/hr to operate more than half of the mining of BTC.

When Binance was considering a reorg, it was within the realm of possibility to bribe/reward mining pool operators (top 3-4) into orphaning blocks that held collectively over 51% of mining capacity. 
An entity with leasable hash power could charge a base minimum of 200k USD/hr for 51% capacity excluding block rewards. 
We have to consider that there are many entities with hash power that don’t currently involve themselves in Cryptocurrency. 
SHA-256 ASICs have made keeping up harder in that particular area of compute power however entities may have a greater quantity rather than performance quality of compute power that makes the network vulnerable, I recall when mining pools reached 50% and miners within the pool went to other pools but the industry has changed to hardware manufactured pool mining and it’s not in anyone’s interest for A) three or four entities to conspire, whether bribed or in their self interest, to pass resolutions with 51% hash power and B) disregard others compute power capabilities that haven’t entered the arena and how much those services would cost and if they would be leasable.
Further development and decentralization is required to keep the network secure against bad actors and this isn’t 2012, we aren’t in baby steps anymore, we are trying to get an ETF off the ground and become recognized. This is essential.

Create a bounty escrow with your matched bets to an independent and see if anyone would be willing to take the $1m reward for doing a Bitcoin reorg, just make sure it’s payable in Sfr. in case the network takes a nose-dive, since I’m confident that a party willing to do so wouldn’t care about the long term and network/price recovery and would have to pay additional parties for compute power.

At 120 Billion Attempts Per Second on a ultra high-end Graphics/Gaming System, it lowers the time considerably.
Let’s say you have 100 of those systems programmed not to conflict, working in sync, you would have 4.32e16 combinations tried within one hour. 
43200000000000000 = 1 Hr @ 100x Ultra High End Consumer Hardware
7257600000000000000 = 1 Wk @ 100x Ultra High End Consumer Hardware
14515200000000000000 = 2 Wk @ 100x Ultra High End Consumer Hardware
21772800000000000000 @ 3 Wk @ Same Config
29030400000000000000 @ 1 Month @ Same Config
87091200000000000000 @ 3 Months*
* This is considering all software works efficiently and hardware doesn’t fail. It would take 3 months and $2m excl. Electricity, Software Development, Housing and Maintenance which could easily double the figure to $4m USD and 3 months. The person or entity would also have the private key of every variation of created using those words generated.   
It may not be 20 million years, but ~$5m and 3 months is good going when the words are disclosed. That’s all depending on fact all cylinders are firing correctly and all of the highest end consumer purchasable hardware is being fully utilized.
Specialized hardware could possibly do it quicker, but that requires significantly more resources and time. If it’s 50 systems, add double the time/resources and like wise if it’s  25 systems, add three quarters of the time and resources (one year, not three months) 
Some actors have access to these systems, cyber criminals using advanced botnets, cloud server providers, state sponsored enterprises like universities and supercomputer facilities. This can cut resources required and time required but adds in additional variables like software and hardware efficiency. 
If the balance is known, it maybe worth it depending on the actor and their resources. However pass-phrases and PINs safeguard against this method of brute forcing. Unless of course, your pin is 1234 and your phrase is password or swordfish. Then I guess you can say they worked for it.
But with that compute power comes security disadvantages which can mean: Someone steals it from the thief as soon as he’s stolen the funds.

I used to have this after Gox happened and we went from 1250 downwards to I think ~250 (BTC-e). Mine was the value going from the hundreds back to 50c where we started. 
It ended for me about 7 years into the game. 
Then I realized that if it goes to no value tomorrow, I still have the experience of the journey regardless of the destination. 
It gets better and you need to readjust your focus and keep HODL’ing. 
Forget that it exists and do YoY checks for the long term instead of reading the ticker every time you pick your phone up or look at your desktop.
