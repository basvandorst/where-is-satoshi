First off, you shouldn't be getting downvoted with no responses, that looks bad on the BTC community.
I think the main point made here is that BTC would be a currency the people of Greece could use that would hold value, and as opposed to other currencies, not tie Greece to the influence of a foreign power.

I see your point, I really can't say how BTC could solve Greece's problem, but it is a good option for the Greek people to have a currency option outside of the standard options which are not looking too good. So the point I'm taking from this is that it allows a relief of pressure on the Greek people and keeps them from being forced back into the Euro. 
I agree too that a Greek currency that they control is a good option.

I think you're exactly right, I think there are some very forward thinking people in the industry, and the way it's going many are looking for anything to give a competitive edge. I'm actually planning on leaving this company soon, BTC will definitely be brought up in the next venture. The old guard are moving to retirement and the industry is pretty desperate for some fresh ideas.

But look you have Reddit Gold! That's sure to offset any financial calamity! A few more good posts and you can retire early.

I'd love to use BTC for our trading company (textiles importer), but the industry is still very "old school" and my boss honestly doesn't have a grasp of email, excel or the internet in general. However, BTC would be ideal for transactions to suppliers in CN, India and even domestic. I'd like to sell the concept and implement it, but my confidence in it is a little shaky. I am only invested in BTC as a personal investment to make a return, not as a business tool. Eventually I think it will happen, but again the generation that is running the industry aren't interested and I'm not quite willing to go out on a limb to push the idea.

Oh man, idk why but this thread is really devastating me right now. That feeling is bad when its scaled back by 1000. I feel for you man.

I'm so sorry, I literally frowned. I thought it was bad that I sold 1 BTC for a cool 120$, but that is just heavy.

Yea I've bought at the top of several "bubbles," I've just held on and it's bounced back. Just hold on, grit and enjoy the ride.
