Actually it is the total number of transaction that he was highlighting.

I am also a Canadian and really like the service over at VOS, I would recommend them.

I don't think you understand that the issue here is the timing.  I am sure if it bounced back in 1 hour that would be fine.  But what if he had been watching the markets closely waiting for the right time to make a big purchase.  Finally the "right time" arrived and he made that big purchase.  Then 1 week later the price has already risen 25% and he finds out his purchase has been rejected.  That could be a significant loss.   
Being treated poorly by customer service once would be completely different then the case here where Coinbase has a systemic issue with the way the handle rejections.

If that is your only response to a potentially serious issue that has a probable chance of happening then there really is nothing further to discuss.

Hmm uses terms like "self entitled little cuntbag"  I can see why you are not a business owner!  
Hey how is your sub doing r/businessnetworking

Thanks, if I made a transfer with this version first will there be an issue?  
@_date: 2015-01-05 23:24:08
Thanks!  
@_date: 2014-01-17 00:13:43
Ah, my mistake.  Cheers.

So you suggest electrum.  Can I import using my core wallet key?  or do I need to download a new core wallet and transfer to elextrum? 
@_date: 2015-01-05 23:23:56
ya I had already made the transfer when I posted.  I had not used the wallet in quite some time buy was in a rush to get coins out of VOS.  
It seemed to have worked.   
@_date: 2016-01-04 23:39:10
Thanks, that's a great explanation!  I was just concerned I needed to do something to protect myself.  I am happiest doing nothing, and I'm really good at it!  
@_date: 2015-08-07 17:41:48
Thanks.  I am all ready registered with them, so out of laziness I will probably stay.   What is Consetters Rep like?  are they tursted  
@_date: 2015-08-07 17:42:38
Thank you

Just any FYI, even with today drop it still has 42% gains over this time last year.  
@_date: 2015-08-07 17:42:32
I had heard that, but would you say Quadrig is now considered safer ?  less likely to shutdown etc
@_date: 2017-05-24 16:10:41
This is ridiculous, I just moved to the site on several recommendations. I did a smaller trade and withdrawal as a test without issue, then as soon as I up my total all my withdrawals are being held. 
Edit. 
Polo approved all my withdrawals.  No issues now.  
@_date: 2015-02-23 19:54:52
I just got all my coins back from them!  
@_date: 2015-02-23 21:44:10
Or you could always just click the "NEWS UPDATE" link on the home page.  
I think they have handled this whole issue very well.  
@_date: 2015-02-23 22:58:13
Haha, you sound ridiculous.  Are you just one of those guys that is mad at the world for no reason.  
First of all you said 
"They're being so super shady by not having emailed their customers at all about this whole incident. If you're not on reddit or follow their twitter then there's a large chance you haven't even heard of this"
So the fact that they have a news bulletin on the home page shows they are not being super shady about " the whole incident"  
And as to the info about the withdraws, this is just a guess but as they are processing each one manually, I bet they are just trying to manage the flow of requests.  Here is the thing, people are getting their money / coins out.

Just an FYI, I got all my coins back about 5 minutes ago!  
@_date: 2015-02-23 21:18:38
That's what I did!
@_date: 2015-02-23 19:51:53
Just an FYI, you first must updated your return addresses. Once that is done you must email greg to let him know.  He will then allow withdraws, but only to the return addresses you had previously listed.  
I will be honest, I was really doubting that I was going to get my coins back!
