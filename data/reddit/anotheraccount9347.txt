There is a very good incentive for ESPN and other news services to report the correct outcome of games:  credibility.
@_date: 2014-05-20 00:08:05
Yes.  I agree.  People are not robots.  This is just a game-theoretical model, and a simplified one at that.
 It only demonstrates that this kind of setup (by itself) would not prevent (or even disincentivise) a seller from ripping off a buyer.
I'll be the first to admit that most real humans are NOT Von Neuman-Morganstern rational, nor do they behave that way (see behavioral economics for infinity examples).  I just saw a math problem here and couldn't help but to shoot it with some arrows I had lying around.

I'm super bored at work right now, so I'm going to use my l337 math skillz and look at a generalized version of your proposal to see whether or not it's possible to make this work by tweaking the numbers of BTC involved.
Ie:  Alice wants to a buy a widget worth W btc from Bob.  They create a 2-of-2 multisig address.  Alice and Bob send X and Y btc to the address, respectively.
Then an (unsigned) transaction is created wherein Alice recieves X' btc and Bob recieves Y' btc, where X' + Y' = X + Y.
Bob either sends or does not send the widget to Alice.
Alice chooses to either sign or not sign the transaction.  Bob chooses to either sign or not sign the transaction.
I'll see if there exist any values of W, X, Y, X', and Y' such that the resulting game has a Nash Equillibrium that we believe would be just.
I'll report back here when I'm finished (unless I get caught working on this on the clock and get in trouble).
EDIT:  Fixed my atrocious spelling and grammar.

"For a security issue, we have abandoned the wordpress. Maybe the webpage change again, but now you can check the fingerprints of our SSL cert:"
If their grammar is any indication of the quality of their code, I'd be very careful with this wallet.

Hip Hip, Hooray!
@_date: 2014-05-19 23:17:03
Alas, it turns out there are no values of W, X, Y, X', and Y' that encourage bob not to scam.
For Alice to be incentivized to sign the transaction in the case that Bob is honest we need X' &gt; 0.  That is, to prevent a rational Alice from trolling Bob (taking the widget and not signing the transaction) we need X' &gt; 0.
But if X' &gt; 0, then a rational Alice will ALWAYS sign the transaction, even if Bob scammed her.
On the plus side, we learned something VERY valuable: that game-theoretically secure escrow is NOT something that can be achieved using multisig with fewer than 3 parties.
@_date: 2014-05-19 21:18:51
good point.

Chain-of-Trust application.
You issue your own trust-tokens.  Give them only to those people you feel you can trust.  They pass them on only to people they feel they can trust.
When a stranger presents you one of your own trust-tokens, you know that there exists some chain-of-trust between you and that stranger. 
This is a useful application for anonymous markets, where trust itself is often the most valuable commodity.

I'm sorry to say this, but this won't work.  I'm a mathematician with more than two years formal training in the mathematical theory of games.  If you model this as an extensive form game and use Zermelo's algorithm to trim the tree, you'll see that the only Nash equillibrium is for Bob to scam Alice, then Alice signs the transaction, then Bob signs the transaction.
This analysis assumes that the utility functions of both rational players are linear in BTC (or any positive affine transformation of the same).  In other words, if the players only care about maximizing their profits (or minimizing their loss) then this won't work.  :(
I applaud the effort, though, and it'd be nice to see more of this kind of thing in this sub.  It gives me something to do.
EDIT: To make the analysis more clear, think of it this way: it is ALWAYS in Alice's best interest to sign the transaction, regardless of what Bob has or has not done.  No matter what bob does, Alice gets one more BTC by signing than she does by not signing.  Signing is a dominating strategy for Alice.  Hope that helps.

Awesome, thank you.

I hope we exist in a world where there exists one person (or group of people) that can be trust *one time* to do the right thing.
If so, we can set this thing up without losing too much sleep over whether or not the accumulator can be forged.
That said, if the accumulator is forged, at least anonymity is still protected... so you can convert btc to zerocoin, mix, than convert back to btc in under an hour, and you'll be both mixed and safe.

Coinbase is accessed through the browser.  The malicious extension shows the user one thing and sends another thing to coinbase.  It's all on-the-fly HTML manipulation.
Local wallets like Bitcoin-QT and multibit are unaffected because you don't use them via an internet browser.

(1)  This is (relatively) old news.
(2)  Though VERY interesting for complexity theorists, this has no implications for cryptography -- as cryptographic systems rely on fields with large characteristic, and the techniques used by the researchers do not extend to fields of large characteristic.
(3)  Bitcoin unaffected.
They talked about this a bit at the Chaos Communication Congress.  Worth a look on Youtube.

Can we get a colored coin tip bot please?
@_date: 2014-05-16 02:50:28
Can colored coins be subdivided in the same way bitcoins can?

If you read closley you'll see that this isn't being worked on anymore by the people who developed it.  They built a prototype, won the contest, and moved on.
It is imperative that we get people working on this asap.
@_date: 2014-05-19 22:15:59
That was fun.
@_date: 2014-05-19 21:08:40
I agree.  But in their defense, they thought they were protected by law.  This is the first time people have been arrested for merely *purchasing* hacking tools.  Either way, good for bitcoin.  Free markets demand free currencies.  :)

Just a little grammar nazi nitpick:
on the front page you say "BitWasp takes the privacy of it's users seriously".  Should be   "  its  " (no apostrophy).

Even harware wallets (Trezor, etc) won't work to prevent this.
However, hardware wallets *that support BIP 70* would.  So, yeah.... if anybody has the ear of any hardware wallet developers, please see if you can get them to have thier hardware wallets support BIP 70.
@_date: 2014-04-26 04:09:20
This is actually a pretty serious issue for every online wallet.
I understand that BIP 70-72 can be used to prevent similar attacks from happeneing when the end user is in control of the wallet.  But for online wallets, the end user communicates to the wallet via a browser.  So we really need a way to lock this down for that use-case scenario.
I know people will say "well don't use online wallets", but that's rediculous given the present bitcoin ecosystem and common use-cases.  Almost everyone buys thier bitcoins online through an exchange or a broker.  These exchances/brokers hold the bitcoins in an online wallet for the users until the users transfer them out to a local wallet.  So the 'online wallet to local wallet" process -- which is almost always done via a browser -- needs to be made secure.
TFA -- say, confirmation and authorization via text message -- for all transactions above a user-specified value should be industry standard IMHO.
@_date: 2014-05-20 01:30:46
Yeah, me too.
And if we live in a universe where we can't trust one person out of 200 people to do the right thing one time, then I think our problems are much bigger than cryptography can solve.
As long as Andreas Antonopolis is one of the 200 I'll sleep fine at night.
