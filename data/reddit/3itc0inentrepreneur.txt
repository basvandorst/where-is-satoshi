This may be true of Zynga, but overstock has been killing it lately- up almost 300% this year alone. Either way both these companies are huge. The overstock CEO is philosophically on board with Bitcoin.
As far as Zynga goes, IMO it's much cooler how Bitcoin could change their business model rather than growing the existing model. Imagine if in future apps you could make micro purchases of a couple pennies rather than the minimum $1 etc...

These are orders for a magazine only about Bitcoin- yBitcoin.net
The magazines are designed to introduce people to Bitcoin, and are targeted at high net-worth individuals. I know this is only an anecdote, but just this month we had a Doctor call into the office who had found the magazine in a San Francisco restaurant. He happened to own a pharmaceutical company and understood the friction in shipping orders to developing nations. After reading the magazine a couple times, he wanted to know who to contact about immediately purchasing 10,000 btc.
Anyway, feel free to request a magazine and thank you for the support!

I've said it once, I'll say it again. Do not tip these stories.. there is no way to substantiate it and people's generosity is feeding manipulators to keep posting these sob stories. If it's true, take this as a lesson. But please don't send money to a throwaway account claiming to gave lost 20k in btc on a mistake almost every bitcoiner could tell you NOT to do.

A little bit of background... Went to make a purchase... they were extremely excited but nervous as they had never made a Bitcoin transaction before. I had called in ahead, and they called corporate for a little crash course in how to accept payment. Get to checkout and they pull out this huge binder with printed out step-by-step instructions. They got confused by the QR code, but I took over a bit and told them to watch... payment was flawless. By this time, all the workers were crowded around the iPad. Once the transaction cleared, there was a moment of silence... some one said OMG in real country voice, and then 3 or 4 people started talking at once about how they knew this was going to be the next big thing and they'd been following on the radio and all the kids were doing it these days etc... you know... pretty hilarious and awesome experience overall.

Until a public address showing this has been posted I would consider this a scam. All he showed was a screen shot of an empty wallet and he's using a throwaway account. His behavior is highly suspect, 20k+ invested into BTC without any account or verifying information? Do not send this person money until he shows a public address which he can get from the exchange he bought the coins at and then withdrawaled to.

Hi Simon! Shoot me an email. David
We delayed shipping our international magazines because demand was so over whelming we could distribute more if we went with the most cost effective postage. We get dozens of bulk request a day and sometime just one of those request will be for 10,000 magazines! And we print 30k! So we made the decision to delay international shipments until we can satisfy local demand... lame I know, but it was a "How do we get the most bang for the buck in terms of on-boarding new people to the community"
Edit: Did you request the magazines through the website? If not, please send in an online request, it's how we manage our database. We will be sending international magazines eventually... the larger the shipment we do the cheaper it comes in per magazine for us!

I was working for a hedgefund and while I had heard of bitcoin I never evaluated it seriously until a conversation I had with a colleague in 2012. He was skeptical but something immediately struck a chord with me.. after alot of dilligence I started investing significantly around $10 a bitcoin. Made lots of mistakes in the process.. ive literally made and lost thousands of bitcoins... I once lost over 1000 bitcoins in a day... but ultimately everything worked out well and ive definitely learned alot. I made enough money by April 2013 to quit my job and work full time on Bitcoin. I started a Bitcoin business focused on adoption and education... people thought I was nuts walking away from a lucrative career and seemingly rejoiced everytime something bad happened to Bitcoin or the price went down. That changed during the last bubble and now people treat me very strange like im some tech genius (which couldnt be further from the truth)... now most of  my friends are Bitcoiners or very close personal friends as "normal" conversation has become very boring to me and people who dont know me well but know Im a serious bitcoin investor treat me weird (instead of being assholes theyre too nice/reverent). Theres a circuit of early adopter bitcoiners that travel the world together attending conference and what not, and ive really enjoyed being a part of that... some of these guys ive known less than a year but they seem like life long friends.. its weird how bitcoiners seem to click really well together like we're all cut from the same cloth.

Hey so just to weigh in real quick. My name is David Bailey- I own yBitcoin Magazine, have been involved in the community for almost two years, and have attended every single Bitcoin conference except one. I am personally involved with this project, and know both of the devs well- I cofounded a company with one of them when I was in college that does microlending (Forza Financial).
To clarify your concerns: while these two devs are completely honest and trustworthy, I think it's important that you shouldn't have to trust them. Not to speak for them, but I know this is an active concern and something they are working on solving- the system needs to be 100% transparent for it to work and scale to a bunch of users, otherwise it becomes a liability. If you have any suggestions on how that trust and transparency can or should be established, please visit the avalonic website and shoot them a message.. I can guarantee they will read it.

No point in counting coins, (too painful to think about honestly!) but we put a bunch of btc to work in-order to launch yBitcoin. We're printing over 30,000 magazines free of charge (with the help of our advertisers) every quarter and are planning to bring bitcoin to a million new users over the next year (we have big plans to help further scale the business). You can help our cause by signing up for a magazine on our website, and giving it to the person who you think is most likely to join the Bitcoin revolution.

So I just called my local store to inquire when they would start accepting it so I could go buy my girlfriend and mom some gifts (and lets be honest, I want a watch too and maybe an once of gold or something) and they had no idea they had started accepting it... but were very nice about it on the phone. Lady said she would call corporate and give me a call back today. Then I realized, one of the benefits of large merchant adoption is that they have 1000's of employees that are going to become knowledgable about Bitcoin and actually care about its success since part of their paycheck is derived from it. The lady at REEDS seemed very eager to learn and accommodate me (it was clear she wanted my business!) Very excited about this news! When you can buy a Big Mac, it's game over.

Not looking good, but it appears fiat withdrawals are being processed and there is a non zero chance you could get your money.. evidently they have like 50mil in cash or so to payout existing withdrawals, while hoping bitcoin prices (and thus their liability) on their exchange crash to nothing and they have no legal responsibility to pay them

Thanks for comment, I think what I'm getting at is your point... buying at discount is more betting that they don't flee rather than whether the are solvent. The solvency issue is what scares me- I don't think they will flee as that will effectively be a death wish.

I own yBitcoin so I am intimately aware of domestic/international shipping cost. Because you bought multiple issues the size container they will have to use is larger than an envelope... fairly confident that rate is at cost for them. Amazon can negotiate special deals and can use their own infrastructure... if you're using the postal system prices can get absurd. Specifically international shipments are very expensive... for a while we offered free shipping world-wide at yBitcoin, but the international expense got so high we had to switch to free domestic shipping only.

We ship individual orders from our printer (they have an automated system). One of those priority boxes fits 50 magazines, these are heading to Bitcoiners who get a bulk amount and then help distribute them to high-end locations in their area (and with friends/family/coworkers of course).
In terms of shipping cost: we work with all the different shippers and have competitive pricing from all of them. yBitcoin is not the only magazine we print, so we've been in this business for 30 years. For these types of shipments, this is the most cost effective way to move them.

We need to call NPR and have them issue a correction. They said Charlie and the other dude conspired to sell 1million worth of drugs- that is outright false.

It's not for sale, it's free! If you're in EU all we ask is you cover shipping. You can request one (or many) on our website ybitcoin.net  there is a check out option that basically charges 1 cent for the magazine and then whatever your shipping is.

This   is the point I'm trying to make even if I came off too enthusiastic  . There are only 2 million bitcoin users, even if this bowl gets 1 million viewers, this is a big deal for bitcoin.. thats not including all the additional press, sports centers, highlights, and the fact that this is a 4 year sponsorship. This also provide a talking point and builds the credibility and narrative around bitcoin. Categorically this is a big deal. By the time it's all said and done it could grow bitcoin users by a million realistically. This sponsorship is about making bitcoin seem normal, and I think it'll work. Haters gonna hate though.                   .

This is a question we're constantly asking at the yBitcoin office. I think part of the solution is making Bitcoin more accessible. Most people who use the internet don't care about how the internet works- as time goes on I believe we need more products, news, and services facing the audience that doesn't care how Bitcoin works.

I don't think so as nobody has mentioned it but perhaps.  Would be interested to see if bitcoin.com analytics are up significantly, but we've gotten enough calls that it's beyond just a random increase. Probably confluence of being geared toward newbies, having an easy to reach number, and the fact we aren't trying to sell anything (beyond the idea of bitcoin). Every caller that I've talked with has been older.

Wish we could print more, but 30,000 is the most we can do per quarter until we onboard more advertisers. You have to realize though that 30,000 magazines translates to over 100,000 readers.
Also the content doesn't change much issue to issue- we're not trying to do what Bitcoin Magazine is doing (providing badass news and analysis) We're just a primer designed to introduce Bitcoin's most basic concepts and get them to seek more information.. We're trying to take someone through the intellectual steps necessary to both buy and spend their first Bitcoin (in my opinion buying your first Bitcoin is the biggest barrier in the space, once you have that you actively want to learn more)

I'm not 100% sure how they calculated that number but if they're using some equations like "1 gigahash cost x" then it might be significantly off... What YiFu was talking about was more along the lines of an existing company with the manufacturing capacity to build it in-house like Avalon did.. It would still be very expensive though so it is very unlikely and increasingly more so every day.. 28nm ASIC will help a lot. You gotta remember though, it only took a handful of ASICs to make FPGA mining irrelevant.. so there is no telling if Intel could create some power mining chip that recreated that same dynamic (though I have absolutely no idea about that) You can google YiFu Bitcoin 2013 San Jose Conference to find the video. I don't think this will happen and I am heavily invested in BTC but I think it is worth mentioning as a theoretical issue.
Also I am underselling YiFu, he really is a great/smart guy but by no means did he have millions of dollars in resources... much less hundreds of millions or billions.

I'm not Chinese but can read it (majored in it in college) do you mind linking his qq? I google him + scam and did not return any hits other than like a 20 btc amount he was holding in escrow back when it was $100 a coin. I know for a fact Li Xiao Lai has a lot of bitcoin because I've met several of his associates and as I mentioned I personally know three different teams that have got seed funding from him (and by know I mean I am friends with their executive team). 
As far as you calling him poor, it was my understanding that he was in the private school business and operates a bunch of schools (like a 100+). I imagine that is good business if done well (in China at least)
Additionally, you ask if I can recognize a ponzi. To me, paying out less than 5% per year does not exactly sound like a Ponzi scheme- it sounds like he is using the pool of coins to offer hedging tools.. ie he loans large amounts of coin to a hedge fund/bitpay/ second market w/e so they can short bitcoin and reduce risk. If you go onto bitfinex now you can get a similar interest rate lending your coins through their platform which is a no risk investment since their platform is automated.
As I mentioned, I have no stake in this conversation other than I have a significant investment into Bitcoin and run a Bitcoin company so I think peoples reputation is very important in this business.. If you have a source you could point me to I would be appreciative, but as I mentioned I have only heard good things about Li Xiao Lai. 
Edit: I guess my question is, you keep saying Li is infamous. What is he infamous for? Could you link to something that explains the notoriety?

I'm definitely against the war on drugs, but I do believe you have to work from within the legal system (creatively). That's why I love Bitcoin, it's a way for us to legally rebel against the system and fix it. If BTC became illegal I would move to where it was not. I know this doesn't sound as sexy as "bring it all down" but I think it's my upbringing, professional experience, and family, that boxes my perspective like that. I'm not casting stones one way or the other though.

I see what you're saying but the corresponding cash liability would be eliminated.. do this long enough and you've eliminated all your liability for withdrawals... it would be like a sponge soaking up all the liquidity until it reach saturation (solvency)... the lack of liquidity at other exchanges would be a limiting agent though. The longer it takes them to process withdrawals the larger the spread, the faster they can clean their books...  Hmm this is starting to sound convoluted...

As a result of mtgoxes perceived insolvency... the premium on gox coins is because gox/usd is discounted to reflect risk.. If no solvency issues then wire transfers would process quickly like they do for almost every other exchange. Additionally, this could mean anyone with a Paypal account can now purchase Bitcoins with that account, lowering the barriers of entry to buying coins. Once you own the coins, its much easier to sell them as you don't have to wire money or provide bank information.

This is what I was thinking:
MtGox has 1million usd on hand, through an affiliate they send 250k usd everyday to Bitstamp account and buy xx number of bitcoins.. make up some fake reason for why you can't process anyones withdrawls.. Transfer bitcoins to Gox and sell at say 10% mark up getting clients to release 275k fiat to you + fees.. use fiat earnings to slowly clear backlog of withdrawals without deteriorating your balance sheet.. keeps MtGox price from exploding upwards and allows them to return their balance sheet to good health multitudes faster than using fees

My girlfriend is heading up there on Sunday to help me pick something out, then sending BTC from AL directly to the shop owner... pretty excited!

Just an FYI, as I've posted this elsewhere. We're printing a magazine called yBitcoin, that will be shipped internationally, designed to answer all of these question and serve as a primer on Bitcoin. We've gotten experts in the space to contribute their knowledge (BitPay, KnC Miner, Erik Voorhees, Bitcoin Magazine, Andreas Antonopoulos, CoinDesk, Tuur Demeester, BitPremier, Coding In My Sleep, and more) and will start by printing over 30,000 issues a quarter. We are also making a digital addition that can be shared via email or web link. The magazine is completely free as it is 100% advertiser supported. Feel free to direct people to  and please request as many copies as you can realistically hand out to friends, neighbors, and favorite merchants.
Edit: I forgot to add, we're going to press Nov. 12th to ship by the 15th!

Even if what you are saying is true, this is huge news... as it implies we now have an exchange with zero risk of insolvency... if an eBay "exchange" had been operating officially in April the price wouldn't have fallen through the floor and there wouldn't be a 15$ spread between Gox and Stamp...

YiFu from Avalon told a story at the San Jose conference that in Feb. of this year he was holding enough ASIC chips literally in his hands to complete a 51% attack. That one 22 year old kid with a handful of friends and access to a forge on weekends... A major tech company could easily destroy Bitcoin which would be very bad for people holding BTC... Cryptocurrency is the revolution and a new one would spring up if that happened, but that's no solace to the person whos btc holding just became worthless. So there you go.

Can you point to any frauds he has been involved with? I know several teams that have received seed funding from him and I have only heard great things. Source please?
EDIT: this is a serious question, I have no interest in this company but Li Xiao Lai through Bitfund.pe has made dozens of venture investments- are you just smearing him or is there a history of fraud I'm unaware of?

I normally wouldn't waste my time with a post like this (what is this high school?) but I just wanted to say if Peter, or Tihan, or any of the other people you're ripping on read this... thank you for all your dedication and time you've committed. Thanks for working full time and long days to try and help build Bitcoin (in your own way) and know that many people ARE THANKFUL for your effort and energy. Bitcoin isn't about tearing people down, its about picking yourself up and keeping the benchmark moving forward.

haha what do you want from me? A picture of the deed? Me holding a newspaper on the balcony smoking a cigar? You act as if nobody would sell an asset for Bitcoin... Look- it's my beach house, and unless you're interested in buying it frankly I have no interest in proving it to you. I would not even comment on this, but I don't want any serious buyers to doubt that it is for sale.
@_date: 2013-11-20 07:23:00
Is there any official documents or emails, which you can scrub the names from, that you can upload onto imgur? Why would you be secretive about the announcement if you are already posting that there will be one?
@_date: 2013-09-06 22:46:57
Ebay is just peeved that reddit stole their limelight... To me it shows something even bigger is happening beneath the surface, otherwise why take it off? Unless you were planning a media splash... Otherwise whats the point of wasting all the money on the Bitcoin video and to bother adding the category if your plan is just to delete once anyone finds out about it....?
@_date: 2013-10-22 00:47:23
yea I agree but it takes that level of commitment... I mean selling your home for Bitcoin isn't easy. 2,100 isn't about being in a club- it's about being in the 1% of 1% or top 10,000 holders. I'm nowhere near this amount yet but its a goal I've set. If you counted backwards from the top 10,000 richest people in the world its not a bad spot to be in
@_date: 2013-09-06 18:24:26
Why this is not true: yes, Bitcoin could usher in a cashless society in which every transaction could be monitored- but the state would have to sacrifice all capital control (internationally) which is a much bigger deal... if they could somehow end up controlling the network so to implement controls, Bitcoin's utility would be destroyed and the market would just follow a new altcoin that circumvented the regulations. Additionally, the very same tool they could use for financial transparency against the people could then be turned against the corrupt governments as well.
TD;DR They give up too much more than they receive to support it.

Great idea, but we're looking for 9 photos for the cover! We want to showcase the global nature of Bitcoin and that contrary to popular (and ignorant) opinion Bitcoin is accepted at real business and can buy real things.

I run a Bitcoin business, so not entirely fair but I also operate a non-bitcoin business as well. Comparing the two- our invoicing could not be easier than with Bitcoin. Getting paid minutes after invoicing from someone literally on the other side of the world, without getting slammed in fees or hassle, has got to be one of the most satisfying feelings! IMO it feels better than cash.. still gives me goosebumps.

Well I am a biased source, but those Zillow prices are no where near correct- I think they use tax assessed value or something. If this is a property you're interested in, feel free to connect with a Realtor from the area for more information.

That train of thought runs contrary to my philosophical outlook. Just say'n...

Now you're asking the right questions.. it use to not be a messed up place and now it is, what changed? That's what you need to figure out.. but your other analogy to Japan makes no sense, that would mean bitcoins are not being adopted in other developing nations.. which obviously is not true.. Taking your Japan example to its logical extension, Japan must be the best place in the world because MtGox is there...

Its not just a parent company, it's a board member of Business Insider. By saying Bitcoin is a "joke" for "clowns" he's directly insulting one of his bosses effectively saying he's a complete fool.

Syria was a very wealthy country until just a couple years ago. There are many wealthy syrian families that would be considered middle class here. They have assets that they need to remove from the existing banking system so they dont lose them if it disappears. Because there is a war, there will be capital controls implemented (if not already) to keep cash and hard currency from leaving the country.
