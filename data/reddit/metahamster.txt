My favourite was when it had $500. I knew it was coming a minute before, so I prepared a Reddit post on It hit $500 - so I submitted the post - and then it went straight down again, so my post got removed! It was hilarious :)
Merry Christmas everyone!

I have a whopping ~0.143 BTC haha

If you give 3 'possibly correct' options to anyone (even hackers), they would have to exhaust 729 possibilities (assuming 6 words uncracked). If that's not enough, you could even go to 4 (4,096 possibilities). The issue is, at least definitely with 4, the only types of people who would do well from it would be hackers using brute-forcing tools. No-one is manually going to enter 4,096 possibilities (or even 729).
Alternatively, you might just find that this type of puzzle isn't the best type, as it relies too much on guesswork. Crossword puzzles, riddles, etc. might replace it... Just a thought.

It looks like a really nice website :)
I like the idea of crossword-style puzzles.
Also, how about having a guess option built in? There are ~2,000 possible words, so even if only 1% of them could apply to each clue, you would have 20 possibilities per word. You could have two options: wrong, or 1-of-3 (or something similar), whereby 3 possibly correct answers are selected, to avoid people just guessing every single possibility for each word.

'Any guesses tweeted at  will be confirmed or denied. Three guesses per handle.' - I guessed yesterday but still no reply :(
Also, what's going on with the new 'done!' javascript popup?

Sadly it almost definitely is. If you look at the three addresses, only one of them holds any bitcoins. If the 1.78 BTC were there to build fake trust for potential 'customers', why wouldn't it be in the other wallets? You wouldn't aim to build trust solely in your cheapest wallet, you would do all three or at least the most expensive one. Very sad times :(
On the plus side, I made a post about it on bitcointalk and also messaged the mods to get it removed there :)

Thanks. So what happens when I receive new coins from now on? Does it depend on which chain I receive them?
@_date: 2015-08-15 23:47:29
Ah, OK. I doubt this will be a large problem but I was just interested...
@_date: 2015-08-12 13:12:05
You could make it much more manageable by adding the number of letters in each word! That would be really good.

I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but from what I've read, theyGot them now... :(
@_date: 2015-08-15 19:36:07
Could someone explain why/how this doesn't affect additional coins you may hold. Also, how will this work with 'client-only' wallets?
(Sorry for the noob questions)

What? We hit $500 for a few seconds, then just happened to go straight down.
