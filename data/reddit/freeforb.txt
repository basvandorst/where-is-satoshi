I am shocked to hear you say that "ethnewbie1" For the record when I entered this space in early 2014 everyone said BTC was dead and I believed it. They/I were wrong and I fear all the "ethnewbies" will suffer the same fate. It is a tough lesson to learn.

Well said. Lots of good points.

The same personality traits that makes someone want to be a visible figure, (speak at all the conferences, go on the podcasts, write the blogs) also make it hard to admit when they are wrong. I have started to tune out the loudest voices in this argument. If you are the developer you want people to think you are. Write code and stop talking.

Last time I looked there were no good options for US users. Has that changed?

Read the post again. Vitalik is saying that the community should vote. ETH will be subject to the same drama that BTC is now. You are kidding yourself if you think otherwise. I am happy you are making profits now but as someone who went through the previous ICO nonsense in 2014 it will come to an end. Protect yourself.

Ok. What will the total number of ETH created be? I am waiting.
@_date: 2017-06-12 23:27:38
You just gave me a post with "approximately" and issuance is not set and probably should be voted on. You are comfortable with that?

I for one would love to hear your 5 year old analysis of the problem, risks and possible solutions. The floor is yours.

I imagine in many countries without Fiat/Crypto gateways it would be very useful. A good local bitcoins alternative. That is of course assuming the fiat/crypto trading system works well.

Genesis and ITBit both have large OTC operations. In interviews I have heard in the past most of the big players use the OTC desk.
@_date: 2017-12-18 17:47:21
I would think their buys would be OTC. It would not show up on an exchange chart.

I agree! The ETF pump was over so smart money moves to pump altcoins. The resulting dip in Bitcoin fuels panic in all the noobs so they buy ETH and Dash. Why is everyone acting like we haven't seen this before?

I didn't purchase anything from him and I am a dummy but not a fool. I am well aware that it is a sales pitch. I don't think it was a dumb question. There are numerous examples where printing currency at the rate we have since 2008 ends in disaster. I am just asking for an example where it has worked out. Are we going to argue that QE isn't printing money out of thin air? Would you like me to use another term? What would you call it?

Curious what you guys think about the recent article from "experts" saying that investors should not expect returns like we have had in the last 40 years. (Bill Gross was the most recent that I saw but there have been others) Have many years would it take of less than 9.2% for you to change up your strategy?

I enjoy their podcast also but think they are way off in the Indexing belief. What I should say is yes indexing will help you retire comfortably with a sound investment plan but the truly wealthy people in the world play both sides of the market.
Check out Mike Maloneys "Hidden Secrets of Money" - helped even a dummy like me understand USD creation.

Nope. I don't own any Gold/Silver myself and yes that is his business. We all have to make a living somehow right? I just like his video series because it is informative and easy to understand. I think it is Episode three that talks about the Fed and money creation/money supply. As I said earlier - made it easier for a dummy like me to understand. We aren't disputing that money is created out of thin air are we? Isn't that where this all started? Do some research and give me 1 example where debasing a countries currency has work out in the long run.

I get the impression you think no one beats the S&amp;P. Now I will agree that for the average investor the S&amp;P is the best option. Most studies show that 95% of all retail traders lose money. (lots of it) I just dispute your claim (maybe I misunderstand you) that people can't beat 9.2% - There are people that can.

I don't think it is that controversial. A lot of the key points come from fed literature.

Anyone else notice the horrible exchange rate in the last few weeks. Now you pay a fee and a premium price. I have not switched yet but likely will for the reasons above.

Source? I don't believe this is true. The seller doesn't care where the money is coming from.

Glad "redditor for 5 days" weighed in on the situation. I was pumped by this but not I am not sure.
@_date: 2017-04-21 00:10:04
You should.

Jeff Garzik has contributed how much to Bitcoin development? I think you will struggle to find his commits.
@_date: 2017-04-22 13:53:04
Thank you for making my point for me. Did you read them? You can have a list like that and have people call you a senior developer for Bitcoin. He may contribute but he should be looked at as an expert.
@_date: 2017-04-21 16:04:30
I have. Show me his github commmits. I will wait.
