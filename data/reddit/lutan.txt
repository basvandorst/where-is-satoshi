So, what's the go-to segwit address generator? I want to setup a paper wallet.

Ah, I see. Thanks for the answer! Now I feel a lot safer.

Going to ask again:
What's the go-to segwit address generator? I just want to setup a paper wallet, but the only thing I could find is segwitaddress.org. Their addresses are 34 characters (public key) / 52 characters (private key), which doesn't fit the 64 characters mentioned on the [Wiki here](
I just want to pull my BTC from Coinbase, but I'm not sending it to some random address without feeling sure about it.

Yeah, just tried it again, and it's just telling me I don't have enough funds in my EUR wallet and I need to fill it up.
Apparently the feature you're describing is an US or debit card only feature, though I'm not sure.

I just got the same mail, and the only exchange I used back in the day is BTC-e, which was apparently rebranded to wex.nz. Maybe try there first?

What's up with LN stuff? Do I need another kind of address for that?

If I'm not mistaken, Germany is not on the list of officially supported countries, but still working. I'll try it out during the next days myself though.

I'm going in on monday when my funds are finally added on GDAX. Already prepared my cold wallet. Too bad adding funds takes so long, I would have bought in at 9.5k. Oh well.

19k lmao

I downloaded the [paper wallet generator]( from bitcoinpaperwallet.com in order to create a paper wallet on a fresh offline computer.
According to the [Wiki here]( a private key is 64 characters long. But the generated private key from the page I mentioned above is only 60 characters long.
Where does the difference come from?

I'm probably mistaken here, but: In order to buy BTC I need to have some money in my EUR wallet on Coinbase. To get money into my EUR wallet I need to do a SEPA transfer which basically means I have to walk to my local bank, type in some shenanigans into one of their terminals and then wait a few days to get the transaction done.
Coinbase doesn't just pull the money out of my bank account, I need to send it from there. And that takes some time.

I remember getting a mail from haveibeenpwned back in the day and checked on the page again just to make sure, and indeed, BTC-e is the only crypto related breach of mine. So that's our winner, I guess.

If I'm not mistaken, Coinbase and GDAX are literally the same company, using the same backend. It's just two different frontends for different kind of users. It's just SEPA deposits that take a day or two (or more on weekends).

I see. I checked out [segwitaddress.org]( but again, the same problem as above:
Are they supposed to be 34 characters (public key) / 52 characters (private key)? I can't find any info on that stuff and it just feels pretty random.

I refuse to sell because the moment I sell the price will definitely go back up again.
You all are going down with me.
