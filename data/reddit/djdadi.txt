I don't know where you live but houses around here sure as shit don't double every 10 years. 
I just looked at the Zillow average increase for 10 years.... 11.8%.
Also, that means a $100,000 house in 1960 would be worth $3,000,000 today.  Your math is *slightly* off.

I'm not sure you understand how paper wallets or bitcoins work.... if the OP's coins were on his phone or computer wallet, he would literally have to do 0 work.  If he had another paper copy, same thing, 0 work.  The only time he would have to do any sort of minimal work, is if the coins were encrypted on something like a dropbox account; then he would have to download the file and import it into a wallet....takes 30 seconds.  
To spend any of the coins on any (encrypted) paper wallet all he would have to do is type the correct password, which isn't any harder than entering a PIN on a debit card and orders of magnitude more secure.  
@_date: 2017-02-07 18:03:13
Firstly, I don't think regulations are a bad thing.  I apologize for the tautology, but: bad regulations are what's bad.  We could just as easily get 1 really shitty regulation replacing two helpful regulations.  The answer is better quality regulations and law makers, not just less of them.
Some instances where this policy fails:
When we add a new regulation about the amount  and quality of sensors that must be on an autonomous car so it doesn't accidentally kill people, do we have to get rid of two other working regulations in the DMV?
How granular is a regulation; for example does this cover things as minor as squar footage required for a hospital bed area?
Must these regulations be of equivilent importance?  For example, does


carry as much weight as:


What about new industries?  If there are no regulations and you have to remove two while adding one, this new industry can never add even **one** regulation?

@_date: 2014-04-28 19:25:42
The difference between a debit card and btc?  There are many, but the top few reasons are: 
*Security: using your debit card potentially gives your card number and info to the place it was used and may be stored and compromised later
*Cost:  While there is no interest on a debit, all the normal transaction fees are still rolled into the price
*Anonymity: self explanatory
*Redundancy: why the OP was excited, he could have his wallet backed up in 100 different places and as long as it is properly encrypted, its perfectly safe to lose your wallet.  And even if you do it takes seconds to sweep previous wallets to a new one

If that's so trivial, why isn't this commonplace?  There are PD's across the country with stacks of iPhones they want unlocked.  You're being quite dismissive for someone with only guesses.
As I understand it, when iPhone encryption key is made it uses the UID together with the passcode to make a unique key independent of just the passcode.  I am not sure if this feature is dependent on the secure enclave, though.

I never claimed I had a better one, but not having a good solution doesn't mean we should just try bad ideas until we find a good one.


I see this problem reminiscent of money in politics in both scope and size.  So how do we get money out of politics?  An EO won't do it.  Congress certainly won't do it (at least made up by the current body).  The best answer I have is to utilize a grass-roots movement and elect less corrupt people into office, then go from there.  
I'm certainly open to new ideas on both issues, but there are *lots* of problems with the 2-for-1 regulation EO that will seemingly never make it a good idea.

The low transaction fees have been a central selling point of bitcoin for years.  $1 hurts that selling point a lot, but, what if it goes *even higher*?

The only substantive thing out of all of those links seem to be the idea that maybe they could copy then rewrite all the NAND memory to attempt more retries (which I'm not even sure is possible).

To which Ponzi schemes are you referring?  I wasn't aware there were any active ones occurring.

Have you not read any posts on this subreddit?  Virulent hate for ETH.  I don't get either thought process, I hope they both succeed.  Tribal think is silly and immature.

It also put the concept of blockchain through trials and tribulation, so now new coins based on similar technology don't *need* to prove themselves 8 years before they take off.

Why not just put a password/PIN on Authy?  If your phone number gets attacked and authy is compromised, that should give you plenty of time to disable necessary accounts before they're able to bruteforce the Authy pin/password.

You can mine and get bitcoin *today*!.....using Nicehash.

It's not free money, you put your time and knowledge in and multiplied that times the risk.

Being part of a small community, being non-mainstream, money is involved, emotions are involved, different coins (that some perceive are in competition with each other) are involved.  Perfect recipe. 
I own some of most crpto's, so I'm happy as long as the community at large does well.

Those orders take 3-10 days to get to you, not 0-2 days.  So that reason doesn't make sense.

This is the strangest advice I think I've ever seen on subreddit.

Or it could be the fact that there is a scripting language that allows for smart contracts.  Either/or.

Not exactly sure what you mean by this, but, Jaxx is adding new coins to their wallet soon too.  I am holding quite a bit of STRAT waiting for a Jaxx version.

My girlfriends mom watches Korean news everyday.  Everytime I see her she says:


No clue if any of that is accurate, but 60yo Korean women are pumped about crypto.

There are a lot of guides out there to try recovery yourself for free or nearly free, if paying $2400 is the only other option.
@_date: 2017-06-12 12:16:47
Really?  I wasn't aware, which ones?
@_date: 2017-06-14 12:37:20
I hope that happens.  Cheap coins!

Wouldn't quantum miners raise the difficulty such that other quantum computer couldn't crack the encryption?  Or is this a different problem altogether?
*I know near nothing about 'hacking' bitcoin or quantum computing.

This is the real answer.  They're going to end up helping each other more than either is hurting the other.

Yeah, bankers, Wallstreet, all those guys are idiots.  Haven't they learned you can't make money with money?

You're so biased sounding it's crazy.  Bitcoin is in the middle of scaling issues *right now* and has been for months.  The reality is both of them will have this issue going forward and both will adapt.
@_date: 2017-06-21 12:30:56
Yeah.  Usually when you hear these stories it's something like Mark Zuckerburg writing some amazing code with an amazing unique idea, then deciding to quit college.
This kid more or less got *very* lucky, and because of his luck just wants to skip college.

The same?  A normal USB flashdrive is easier to get infection with a virus, for one.

I concede that all cases we're talking about are possible, but wouldn't intercepting something like a Trezor and engineering / replacing it with a decoy be more manpower than they'd be willing to spend for anyone short of an international kingpin?  
But, at that point you're going to have to change a whole lot else about your life as well...
@_date: 2017-06-28 19:05:53
maybe that long to confirm, but not broadcast.  Someone with more technical knowledge than me can chime in, but I don't understand why low cost transactions need to confirm.  It seems like the chances of the system getting hacked / double spent for a hamburger would be so rare it wouldn't even matter.
@_date: 2017-06-05 12:23:18
Still not entirely sure what you are saying.  If Bitcoin was somehow destroyed tomorrow, as far as I know all altcoins would remain unaffected.

Several other currencies already use Eth as a backend

I've always lost money on trading too.  Recently though, I've had luck  with limit orders on Polo.  33% avg profit over a 6 week period.  Hopefully it wasn't all just luck...

Is the price really that much higher than the states?  I don't put it past my gfs mom to grossly exaggerate.

That's like saying "you can't even buy anything with bitcoin!" in 2010.  It's new.  New things are in alpha/beta.

I refuse to search through my messages because I know I've had similar conversations and I don't want to hate myself.
@_date: 2017-06-06 19:54:55
I still don't understand your argument.  It seems to rest on the fact that you can't trust the manufacturer or those that deliver it.  But the exact same thing could be said about a Pi, or any other computer.  In fact, because there are more component makers and middle men, the risk from this is even greater.
Not to mention, all the security experts in the industry seem to disagree with you as well.

Maybe from amazon.com, but very very few vendors will get you anything on the DNM the next day.
