There is a difference between the fundamental value of a commodity and the market price. See, for example, the tulip bubble.
I invest on fundamentals. I am only interested in non-inflationary (at end state) cryptos which are also used as a medium of exchange. The lower the on-chain fees the better.
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:33:08
Yup. And Bitcoin Cash is a better coin for medium of exchange than Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:36:22
Yeah, and prepaid debit cards exist. Doesn’t mean I’m going to argue that all commerce is going to go to a prepaid debit card/gift card model (which is basically what LN is). Yes they exist, but they’re not the basis of commerce for a reason.
You do you, bro. You not buying in just means I can buy more Bitcoin Cash today just a tiny bit cheaper. :D

DM me your twitter handle and I will tag you in a tweet of an image of my recent Coinbase activity. In the image you’ll see from Sept 22 to Dec 12th that there’s a total of $132K of sales in a row.
Honestly, if I were gonna lie, I’d say I made 7, or even 8 figures lol. 6 figures is not at all impressive tbh.

If I were a vendor, I would accept Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum, and Litecoin. I’d offer a 2% discount to customers paying with any of them.
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:01:17
When you focus on the personalities instead of the actual fundamentals, you make trading mistakes. It's ok, happens to the best of us. Please don't get mad and give me the finger when you read this. :D

Lol yeah, I guess this is now a “feature”. /s
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:13:54
You could sell Bitcoin Cash for Bitcoin, Ethereum, or Litecoin and then transfer over to Coinbase. Look at the daily volume, Ver had months to convert to fiat and could have easily done so; with no material impact on price.
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:36:35
I didn’t invest in Bitcoin Cash because of Roger. I find this all amusing. I agree with his position, and I understand someone pushing his buttons.
What I can’t for the life of me understand is why this interview should have any impact on the future of either BTC or BCH.
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:04:38
Clearly you think I’m a worse person because of my political beliefs. Talk about the pot calling the kettle black. I’m not self-righteous idiot like you are. I am fully aware that I’m trolling on this sub. But hey, if you guys are ok making less money from here on out that’s fine with me. :D
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:29:46
I'm buying BCH and voting for the free market. You're buying BTC and voting for gov (Core) control.
It's pretty obvious which one of us has a degree in economics and which one doesn't.
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:05:50
Ok, so maybe it's a question of your reading comprehension skills rather than math. In my post I very clearly said I'm up 10x in Bitcoin Cash, and Bitcoin is up 6x. Obviously if we are comparing BCH to BTC the gain is less than 10x, as would be patently obvious to anyone not retarded reading my post.
You are literally going "you didn't say what you clearly said" and then calling me a moron. Lol wow.
EDIT: And no, not everyone who sold BCH put it into BTC. Last I checked USD was the standard yardstick for measuring gains, which is why I used that (and still mentioned BTC gains, lest people mention "but BTC went up more" which it did not)
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:04:04
Read this thread and then read r/btc and then decide whether you like Bitcoin or Bitcoin Cash.
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:46:33
Some of us believe segwit is a security vulnerability. You can read up on this and make up your own mind though.
Bitcoin has ceased to be a medium of exchange. Ether doesn’t have that as their main use case either. Bitcoin Cash does, and given the positive externalities associated with currencies (virtuous cycle - higher market cap is more holders is more people willing to accept as payment etc), is the one I’m most bullish on as a result.
@_date: 2017-12-14 15:56:10
They also ignore that he is referring to BCH when he says “Bitcoin”.
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:30:19
Yup. Bitcoin Cash is only 4.5 months old. They are in the “wait and see” phase right now.
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:20:06
Whatever. You’re the one voting for losers and investing in loser coins. Please think of me when you finally hit the “buy” button on the  BCH/BTC pair lol.
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:06:03
I look forward to you joining the BCH party some day. Sooner or later all the sensible people at least hedge their bets by buying some BCH, if not converting over completely.

The average person lives paycheck to paycheck. If you think they are going to be locking up their capital so that Starbucks can have lower transaction costs you are truly delusional.
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:48:41
I would love it if you all tried to leave Coinbase as it would clog up the mempool, cause fees to spike, and lead to a death spiral for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:50:48
Stocks have cash flows that give them value, whereas this is supposed to be a currency.
Currencies are supposed to be units of account, mediums of exchange, and stores of value. The whole point of framing the argument that way is to make it patently obvious how exchange and store of value are connected. Currencies literally derive their value from use (supply/demand). Learn about forex trading/valuation and you’ll see.
With Bitcoin, you’re basically buying a currency that can’t be used in trade due to high fees and transaction times. That’s a worthless currency.
Now, some say that Bitcoin is instead “digital gold”.
Gold is a commodity. Generally speaking, commodities are valued on the marginal cost of production and the edge use case. Despite what some may say, gold has enough industrial and product uses that give it value (it also has unique physical properties that make it an exceptional store of real value in the physical realm). Bitcoin has none of these things.
So, in that scenario, you’re basically buying a commodity consisting of computer code with no real use. Seems like a worthless commodity to me.
You do what you want; but as someone with a heavy finance/econ background it’s pretty clear to me which is the better investment.
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:05:10
Uh huh. Technically Bitcoin is “open source” too.
I disagree with the implementation of LN. Bottom line, do you think Visa and/or Starbucks are going to use LN? I believe the answer to that is a clear “no”. Yet all I hear about is how LN is going to solve for payments.
If what is going to solve for payments is something built by the likes of Visa (not the “open source” LN), then why are people on here always talking about how LN is supposed to be this magical cure for scaling?
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:17:31
Reeeeeee XD
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:05:47
Since the fork, BCH has performed better than BTC percentage-wise. I know it might be hard for you to focus on % gains instead of absolute price gains, but it’s how the real investors look at things lol.
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:38:44
So the vendors who accept Bitcoin are now the enemy? Maybe if you knew anything about payment processing you’d understand that vendors just want payment to work, and are not going to do anything extra. Look at how many small shops still require you to swipe rather than insert the chip. Call it laziness if you want, but you hitched your wagon to an approach that required near 100% buy-in when common sense told you that clearly wasn’t going to happen. Maybe get mad at yourself instead of the vendors who have gone out of their way to accept crypto to begin with.
Meanwhile with larger blocks, vendors don’t have to do anything. It just works, same as it always did. You need a better understanding of how things work in real life. But yeah, you can tell me to go F myself; I don’t care. XD
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:07:40
The premise that the storage or bandwidth requirements for large blocks are unworkable is laughable. There are literally thousands of institutions that could handle the tech specs you cited (today, let alone years in the future). Loading up the network with high transaction fees so an amateur can run a full node on a crap computer with a DSL connection is the exact opposite of what should be done.
@_date: 2017-12-21 07:42:47
You serious? You’re the one who started with the name calling and brought politics into it. Look at the very first comment you posted. Like wow; major hypocrite you are.
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:37:58
As they say; “follow the money”.
Do that, and you’ll see why if anything, BTC is the scam.
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:00:50
The bitcoin.com co-founder sold all his BTC for BCH.
Ver has had a vector to sell his BCH since August. Are you 12? You realize there are other exchanges besides Coinbase, right?
@_date: 2017-12-21 13:08:25
Saying that sooner or later all the sensible people invest in BCH is not an insult. I don’t care if you hurl insults, I just think it’s funny that you’re so delusional/triggered that you think I started it. Today is another day of BCH up, BTC down; get used to it.
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:32:32
Removing the technical fluff; the philosophical debate is essentially:
Does a cryptocurrency need to be a medium of exchange to be a store of value?
If the answer to that question is yes, you tend to prefer Bitcoin Cash. If the answer to that is no, you tend to prefer Bitcoin.
I prefer Bitcoin Cash.
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:22:36
If you’ve been a hodler for many years you should at least keep your BCH from the fork (or buy them back). BTC has done well since the fork too so it’s not that painful to get back to the 1:1 allocation at fork time. And if you didn’t sell them, you should be happy as BCH has done very well and you’re effectively hedged.
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:52:26
Coinbase issues statements last night that trading (post-only) will resume on GDAX at 9am Pacific time and after one hour regular trading will resume.

@_date: 2017-12-20 15:22:22
You need to do more research into how LN actually works. There’s a time value to money (nevermind working capital considerations) and LN is amazingly inefficient because it requires so much capital to be locked up. The actual cost of that system is GREATER than the few % payment processing currently costs.
The low fees you are describing are why vendors and users are switching over to Bitcoin Cash. But, people on this forum think it’s “Btrash” and vendors are just lazy. Lol, it’s hilariously hypocritical.
I also believe in the Flying Spaghetti Monster. May his noodly appendage show us the way to financial prosperity.

There was also a YouTube video of someone (not from nChain) giving a presentation on theoretical security issues with SegWit as far as the main chain. I’m struggling to find it at the moment but it’s on YouTube somewhere.

@_date: 2017-12-20 15:11:37
Let’s be honest; Coinbase could have issued a statement in advance and people here would be saying the same thing. It would run up on other exchanges in advance of listing on Coinbase no matter what.
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:15:53
Nice quote. If you read the thread you can tell it is obviously hyperbole and referring to how I'd rather invest in a coin that tries, but fails to replace fiat than invest in a coin that only aspires to replace gold. On a more serious note:
Lightning Network proposal is incredibly bank friendly. It literally requires just as much (if not more) centralization than big blocks. You are insane if you think we are going to remove financial/banking institutions in either scenario. They provide important functions, whether you realize it or not. My issue with Lightning Network is that it's an inefficient structure clearly inferior to current payment solutions (and proprietary to boot, yuk).
My preferred solution is a free market of 2nd layer solutions competing with each other on top of a chain that has used large blocks to scale the chain a reasonable amount. Exchanges are 2nd layer solutions; you don't need Lightning Network to implement 2nd layer solutions.
Read up on the trade-offs between centralization and efficiency and decide where you want to be on that spectrum. As usual, there is no free lunch.
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:57:13
I feel bad for the uninformed losing their money because of propaganda on your sub. Call me a shill all you want; I have yet to see an intelligent rebuttal to any of my posts (some of which are quite thorough/educational).
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:32:09
There are pro’s and con’s to either approach. I’m not defending what they did; I’m just saying the complaining from this sub would exist regardless. 99% of the complaints are about them listing BCH, not the manner in which they did it.

I bought BCH at an average cost of ~$300. It’s now over $3K. That’s 10x.
I’ve made six figures trading crypto in the last six months. Some have made a lot more, some have made a lot less. I don’t care. You do you, bro.

“Coinbase just announced BTrash is coming to their exchange. Friendly reminder to sell all your BTrash on that day. Make sure noobs know the difference between digital gold and BTrash! Also, close your account in protest and move to Gemini!”
Same crap people are saying now, would be said then.
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:58:27
On coinmarketcap, the lowest historical price that I see for BTC since August 1st is $2,685 (the low on August 1st). So, if you held BTC at the time of the fork, you are up roughly 6x. In fact, since August 1st, the most you can be up is roughly 6x, since BTC never went lower than the August 1st price since the fork.
Bitcoin Cash was in the $200/300s for quite a while. If you bought at those levels you are up 10x.
Like, this is just math. I wonder if you'll apologize for implying I'm dumb since you can easily verify that I'm right on coinmarketcap in like two seconds.
@_date: 2017-12-21 07:41:09

If you watch the video you will see that right before Roger literally loses it, the interviewer is accusing him of paying people to shill for Bitcoin Cash (if memory serves, I think he said sock puppets). In any case, this is pretty obvious if you watch the interview.
Personally, I think this is silly. Anyone can blow up if you push their buttons.

When Gemini adds Bitcoin Cash where will you go?
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:50:00
Current tech can support blocks much, much larger than 1MB. In any case, I don’t think anyone on the Bitcoin Cash side expects all transactions to be on chain forever, but there are much better 2nd layer scaling solutions than LN paired with Segwit.
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:27:55
Lol we just keep winning. People saying Bitcoin Cash is going to zero are the same people saying Trump was going to lose in a landslide.
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:01:36
So much butt hurt on this forum today...
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:55:38
It will make business sense for them to add Bitcoin Cash.
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:56:42
Your last paragraph is the answer. Cash is used less often than credit. 2nd layer solutions (ie Visa) can handle bulk of smaller transactions.
I would argue LN is a horrible solve for 2nd layer (I prefer the free market to solve for that rather than Core).
Current tech can get us to 500 tx/s with simple blocksize increases.
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:07:58
People like you are the reason Bitcoin Cash is going to succeed and Core is going to fail. I could paraphrase your entire argument down to: “but muh feels...they should do what I tell them to!”
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:53:47

Any time people believe strongly in something you’ll see cultish behavior. I personally find it kind of fun. It doesn’t impact my decisions one way or the other (in fact, if anything, the more cult-like the better, you know they won’t panic in a downturn lol).
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:50:34
Is that why Gemini also has Ethereum? lol
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:04:19
I don’t believe they have that one available to trade.
@_date: 2017-11-11 14:31:48
It will take many years to reach adoption levels of VISA. Compare the supercomputer of 10 years ago to the ones today. Even if Moore’s Law slows down and we only get half the exponential improvement, aren’t there computers fast enough to handle that blocksize?
If it reached that size I hate to break it to you but the only people mining will be large institutions (miners, banks, huge retailers, etc.). So we need to think about a $1M setup, not a $2K one. There’s really no way around this, regardless of whether you do it via on-chain scaling, or outsource it to side chains. All a side chain does is force that centralization somewhere else. LN doesn’t scale unless you have really large payment channels (basically, VISA part 2). I’d rather have on-chain scaling for improved visibility; 2-layer solutions will handle really small transactions, even in Bitcoin Cash (but without any changes to the core protocol, akin to how VISA doesn’t need the Fed to change anything about USD for it to process USD transactions).
@_date: 2017-11-11 16:19:12
There is plenty of literature on the pros and cons of on-chain scaling vs off-chain scaling. I am not going to rewrite all that stuff here.
One key thing most people miss is that there are benefits to some level of centralization, which is why it so often occurs. Centralization of some sort (either large miners, or large channels on LN) is inevitable imo. I would argue that a group of large miners is more decentralized than a group of large payment channels off-chain. I also don’t think you need to screw with the core protocol to do off-chain transactions. You could easily create custodial entities that move bitcoins around without having those transactions occur on the chain, just like how banks today move dollars without actually moving around physical tender (note, crypto exchanges already work this way). So long as the underlying asset’s value cannot be inflated away this is a huge win. You don’t need segwit for that. I am in favor of keeping the chain simple and adding complexity outside of it.
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:09:15
You open an account on Bittrex, transfer over the BTC, and then buy Bitcoin Cash with your BTC. Note that in Bittrex, Bitcoin Cash’s ticker is BCC, not BCH as it is in most other exchanges.
@_date: 2017-11-11 14:09:26
These are my thoughts as well, which is why I don’t think LN will work.
@_date: 2017-11-12 04:29:29
He’s probably looking at Bittrex.
@_date: 2017-11-11 18:59:25
I am advocating having as much on-chain scaling as possible as originally intended. I believe this can eventually replace many transactions, but there is a real possibility it’s not enough to replace smaller transactions. In such an event, I favor Paypal/banks/visa/whatever type institutions to come in and fill that gap much like they do today. This does not require segwit or lightning network, it just requires simple on-chain scaling via larger blocks. My key difference from regular Bitcoin is that I don’t believe you need either segwit or LN to do off-chain scaling. Just like how you don’t need it to power transactions on an exchange, you don’t need it for regular payments/transactions.
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:09:30
Miners aren’t just doing the math on what’s most profitable this very second, but also on what’s more profitable long term. It’s common knowledge that miners wanted 2X, they didn’t get it and now have moved over to Bitcoin Cash. Note that when miners started switching over the profitability delta was a lot smaller than it is now.
