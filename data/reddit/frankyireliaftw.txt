My 59 year old dad called it "button" ... and he told me " wasnt that the thing you were talking about a while ago , about those button you told me? How can i buy some" i told him that i had 6 BTC and sold them back in 2015 for 1.2k Dollar because he told me back then that this is bullshit and he kinda made pressure on me why i make bullshit with my money , so yeah you gotta had to see his face when i told him this

All I can see are the arguments from bitcoins fanboys taking the most bizarrest arguments to defend their shitty pow system which will die when the difficulty strikes too high

Good night for everyone bought at Top of bubble..hope you didnt lose your retiring money like some stupid youtuber who invests all in

Thats pretty much me ... 2010 i was on a internet site which offered bitcoin for 10USD ... FUCK MEE , but honestly i dont mind , even tho i probably missed the biggest oppurtinity in my life to be a multi millionaire im still a huge fan of btc by only watching the charts and the discussions on forums etc.. The crazy mining pump and dump days were the best , in the end i made like 0 profit and 0 loss (fingers crossed) but 2 years after that party i like it watching back and getting those memories alive

Well i only hope not that much people will lose money when the bubble starts to burst ... steady growth makes people greedy for more and sensitive for every dip. Dont know if people still are willing to trade if price gets manipulated back to 1700ish

When i began to tell my Friends about bitcoins and cryptos in general they looked at me like i would show them the creation of fire or like i invented the wheel .... people are still so backwarded and not openminded for new things its really hilarious

You will earn nothing , look at all the gigantic enourmous Hash farms in china and iceland , they generate up to 300 to 700 Btc's every month , they also use special produced and designed hardware only for mining. Your Shitbook pro is a freaking joke in opposite to them LOLLL
