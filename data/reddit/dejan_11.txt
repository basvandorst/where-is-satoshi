Thanks for the answer. So the big volatilty may start about one moth from the date the futures start, am i right? Because futures start on monday, and one month from monday the first futures are running out...?

Do they usually bet on the price in one day, one week, in one year, in one hour?

Why not?

Where can i check how many tx are above of mine?

Yeah thanks i figured this out now. In gdax for example when you are making a stop order you can click on advanced an there you can put in the limit price for the stop order. Did not knew this before, but i see it as a learning process. Now this won‘t happen again...
Hope it dips a litte more that i can buy back in again....

About 1000€
@_date: 2017-11-30 10:40:59
No i did not. Is this like sort of a backup then? Or how do i do this on gdax? 
@_date: 2017-11-30 10:46:08
Me neither....

Yeah did this at first, but often dips happen when you are asleep or not avaiable and you did not notice thw alert, so i wanted to be safe and made the stop loss. But now i‘ve learned my lesson....

Yeah i knew that this is possible but i thought: yeah if it goes from 8.6k directly to 8.4 then it sells at 8.4 no big deal.
But i‘ve never seen that the price goes down 2K in about a second and bounces back a second afrerwards...

Yeah thanks, i figured this out now. Unfortunatly i did not know this before.... 
@_date: 2017-11-30 12:24:47
Really? I check the charts every day i think, and i‘m a while into this whole thing by now and i‘ve never seen something like this. But ok, maybe i‘ve not noticed it because it did not effect me at that moment....
