thats not what I am looking for, i know what it is, I just want to buy a small amount of BTC with a Visa Gift Card.
@_date: 2014-02-27 02:57:10
How does that work, have you used it?
@_date: 2013-12-06 01:50:17
Take some when you need/want.

 I Saw 1 million transfer through the block chain today about 2-4 hours ago.
@_date: 2013-11-26 12:29:45
Ah. Alright. This makes sense! Thanks!

How do I make a local wallet? Would the bitcoins still be online? What do I use to encrypt? Would a raspberry pi be ok as a dedicated price of offline hardware?
@_date: 2013-11-27 00:04:11
I used bitaddress.org to generate a key, not blockchain.info 
@_date: 2013-12-10 04:58:36
You do have a very good point....
@_date: 2013-11-26 03:49:27
Same thing different names? 
@_date: 2013-12-12 00:53:22
Pics or it didn't happen
@_date: 2013-11-24 23:11:51
I've looked but I'm looking for opinions and things like that. Then do my research accordingly.
@_date: 2013-11-27 00:55:49
What if I were to reuse the wallet? I'm not going to but what if?
@_date: 2013-11-24 23:27:43
Alright. So lets say I use block chain. Make a back up and email it to myself. Do I then encrypt it? Or...
@_date: 2013-11-27 00:12:26
Make sure it's valid. 
Be able to use it on both iPhone and paper.
I generated an address on the bitaddress.org paper wallet thing and I can't seem to be able to use it.
@_date: 2013-11-27 00:24:47
I understand that, my address works, but how do I get into it to spend it? 
@_date: 2013-11-24 23:36:37
Alright! Thanks!

How am I able to use blockchain for this? I'm on the site now and not seeing anything for paper wallets.
@_date: 2013-12-04 05:02:24
So place your money into various other alt crypto currencies? Like diversify.
@_date: 2013-11-30 01:43:33
I don't know. It just seems like something that would draw in more attention. Just ideas of things to make, tweak and stuff. Just thinking.
@_date: 2013-12-10 03:10:55
@_date: 2013-11-27 18:20:01
Hypothetically speaking. What IF it does happen?
@_date: 2013-11-30 01:41:10
All we need to do us comment?? Are you sure? -.^

Buy immediately sell. Profit 185$

Like, I leave a slip of paper with an address on it. It gets scanned and a certain amount is deducted from my address. The thing that gets scanned is only worth the amount you owe or want to spend. I think this might be possible. Very slim chance.
