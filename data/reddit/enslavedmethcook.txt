No one here is vouching for Paypal. Some people have no other options. I don't use a bank, so even after Coinbase approved my drivers license they wouldn't let me use my Visa because it is prepaid. I didn't want to do a wire transfer and wanted my BTC quickly so the easiest way to get BTC using my debit card was Paypal. I don't use Paypal for anything else.

No problem. It's a fucked up feeling to wake up one morning and be locked out of your wallet. The only response I've seen from Hive's end is along the lines of "We're sorry that our software took a shit on you but these last few months didn't quite pan out how we thought they would financially." I'm just glad I got all my funds out of there.

I'm new to Reddit just trying to help out people with the same issues I had to deal with. Here's the link to the subreddit where posted the test server  Obviously people don't have to take my advice I'm just trying to offer a hand to someone who felt as helpless as I did yesterday.

Thanks for the reply. I ended up finding a Hive test server through a litecoin subreddit and luckily I was able to
 access my wallet after many hours of frustration and zero help from Hive. I instantly transfered all my BTC to new wallets and am now encouraging everyone to steer clear of Hive. For anyone experiencing the same issues here's the test server.  It worked for me fairly quickly.
