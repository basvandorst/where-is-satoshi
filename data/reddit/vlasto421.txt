There’s is an option to do it both ways i believe.
@_date: 2019-07-14 14:43:43
The thing is the way these machines work is merchant never receives coins, he receives straight usd. Once the transaction takes places, the coins are converted to usd.
@_date: 2019-07-13 15:56:46
You can choose the order you like.
@_date: 2019-07-14 13:23:57
I understand, i actually do operate a few in New Jersey , i just don’t understand how this is similar to BTM.
@_date: 2019-07-13 15:37:27
Not my company however i do have an opportunity to be an authorized retailer thus I’m looking for info.
@_date: 2019-07-13 16:06:18
Crypto.com or bitpay card, Coinbase card
@_date: 2019-07-06 13:59:08
For recurring payments? Yes Coinbase we’ll do the job especially if yu don’t have ton of money all I’m saying Coinbase is the easiest for a beginner. You start explaining hardware wallets, paper wallets, people get overwhelmed Coinbase is the best to get your feet wet.
@_date: 2019-07-13 21:10:52
Thank you contacting fincen was my next move Monday.
@_date: 2019-07-13 15:49:19
Yes it is
@_date: 2019-07-27 13:54:27
Umm i run btm operating business and if the funds come from a hot wallet as most operators use this setting then you should have gotten your btc almost instantly.
@_date: 2018-06-27 12:59:27
Let’s face it ... you got into bitcoin sometime in 10000s and now after the little drop you’re panicking huh? Always remember btc was around 2k around the same time last year. 
@_date: 2019-08-10 14:15:35
Only if you want to buy on the spot when making a sale, of course all states are a little different when it comes to license and regulations.
@_date: 2019-08-10 13:11:49
Only if you’re a big company that could afford money transmitter license. Most operators operate from hot wallets nd top up when it gets low to keep the cost low as mtl could run you around 175k plus renewal costs of 140k.
@_date: 2019-08-10 11:48:55
This way btm operators protect them selves from high volatility. We use 15% mark up. 10k btc is 11,5k at btm.
@_date: 2018-06-27 13:09:37
Not too shabby
@_date: 2018-06-27 14:33:25
Facts seems to me you don’t know how to deal with simple problems. Simple phone call would have it resolved without needing to bash actually a decent company in the finance world. I ve had PayPal since 05 and never had an issue. When an issue ever arose i called and had it taken care of very fast. 
@_date: 2018-06-13 19:45:21
Well said man just keep on buying every chance you get ... only less than 1% of earth population even has a bitcoin wallet. We are far away from the peak and I’m glad you understand it. Good luck to you all!
@_date: 2018-06-28 10:24:38
Agree that bitcoin we’ll become a store of value much more than a currency. 
@_date: 2019-06-29 15:39:53
I have to say i won a case back in 2012 worth 4K. Till this day i have not received a penny because even tho i won the kid went to college didn’t have anything to give and unfortunately they had nothing to take. He did wind up with a hit on his credit but that’s all.  What I’m trying to say. I went to court 3 times spent 3 hours each day having to take off work. So if yu make let’s say 200$ a day , to take off 3 days off for $150 doesn’t seem like a great deal to me if you can just stay at work and make it back.  Just take a loss and learn not worth the extra work and stress.
@_date: 2019-06-30 17:21:25
I believe Coinbase is 3
@_date: 2019-06-29 15:32:05
Not true even if you win no one guarantees you they ll pay . What happens if yu win but the person does not have money ? Nor any assets?
@_date: 2019-06-29 15:44:11
Don’t forget the premium on top ;) most operators will up charge btc by 1500$ if yu purchase bellow $800 . So if btc is 10000k you’ll pay 11500 plus the 6-10% fee.
@_date: 2019-06-29 17:50:31
I like Nano but it’s nowhere near as secure as bitcoin it’s strength is small payments. Even when yu have cash at home you don’t bring all your cash out to the bar you take little amount same would be done in case there was no fiat you take your btc ( savings ) and buy something with no fees and instant transactions to cover your small transactions . I wouldn’t leave my life savings in nano specially for security reasons.
@_date: 2019-06-29 15:29:59
Lmao 150$ for small claims court? He’ll spend more money taking off work than getting his money lol i won a case against someone who got me for 4K ( loaned him money ) let’s just say nearly 8 years later I’m still yet to see a dime. More likely scammers are somewhat smart and won’t keep the money where it’s traceable, even then yu sent him bitcoin and there’s no proving that you sent it to him or just sent it to another wallet that you have private keys to. ( not saying yu did that, I’m just saying ) If i were yu forget it and learn a $150 dollar lesson. Good luck tho my guy
@_date: 2019-06-27 17:17:38
Only up to 3k thought. your losses offset your gains. So make sure you include your losing positions to lower your gains. ( pay less in tax )
@_date: 2019-06-24 16:01:07
Ledger nano S, X
@_date: 2019-06-30 13:32:02
If it was this simple wouldn’t everyone be rich ?

Oh don’t mind me i was trying to sound like a douche lol yu good broski
@_date: 2019-06-29 14:56:37
Wire your money to Coinbase pro it’s usually minutes and there’s no 3% buy fee as Coinbase app to buy
@_date: 2018-06-27 14:57:48
Yu don’t need to do business with them I’m just positive you can recover your funds that’s all. 
@_date: 2019-06-24 16:04:09
Use a btm
@_date: 2019-06-04 21:43:37
More liquidity ...
@_date: 2019-06-30 13:59:53
Or you get at at 12k thinking there will be a correction and boom we just jumped to 16k, yu fomo yu buy at 15k and we back down to 12k for awhile now yu missed out on 4K since yu were out and now you down, yu have to wait till yu hit 15k. Now imagine yu bought at 14k during the last bull run  thinking it was a nice correction and boom we at 3k and it’s been a year and yu still nowhere where you’d like to be.
@_date: 2019-06-28 23:23:31
All good in the hood
@_date: 2019-06-29 18:07:46
I’m not btc maximalists know your facts before speaking nonsense It’s no secret btc is currently the most secured network.
@_date: 2019-06-28 23:03:12
Ledger is a different company ...
@_date: 2019-06-29 14:59:47
No only website interface is Coinbase pro app is just simply Coinbase.
@_date: 2019-06-29 07:27:56
Wanna sell fast keep it on exchange such as Coinbase. ( careful they claim to be fdic insured ) however that does not include bitcoin only usd. Wanna be safe ? Get a ledger or paper wallet. Just be careful trying to time the market. In high demand the network is congested and it takes forever to get your funds so at times trying to get your funds we’ll take forever and you’ll more likely than not miss your sell target especially when btc drops like it did the other day.
@_date: 2019-06-29 15:35:00
Yu got it man good luck !
@_date: 2019-06-30 17:34:43
Yull b good
@_date: 2018-03-30 19:07:50
Took you a long time to do research since you nearly purchased the top ��
@_date: 2018-04-17 15:31:21
If you’re stupid enough to believe something like that just know you’re the reason why we have warning labels on shampoo bottles...
@_date: 2019-05-15 17:30:29
Futures killed the bull run not transactions on hold  ....

Tesla all day
@_date: 2019-05-18 11:26:31
It’s also 120% on the year ...
@_date: 2019-05-18 11:49:26
Where would you rather have kept money in the past 5-10 years? An asset that has appreciated 1000x or an asset that has not moved in years while inflation has been increasing? ... btw: i can use my bitcoin to purchase stuff while you simply can’t ...  i agree that we’re years away from the techs full potential but if I’m to leave 50k somewhere for 5-10 years I’m expecting it to grow in value and not by 1-5%.
