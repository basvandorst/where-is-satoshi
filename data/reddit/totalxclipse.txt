Just an update, thanks guys, I was panicking then, the bitcoins have been all "registered" with the updating the wallet, hadn't even occurred to me at the time, thanks!

I thought they were because it says unspent, the node's currently red but was sure it was green earlier.

I know, what I meant by went is... So it isn't in my wallet... (more rhetorical)  
as for the send receive, I understand it's a synonym just find it how you can pay someone, or lend them cash.  
But was hoping there was a transfer option like taking money from my own wallet and putting it in another wallet without needing to pay someone to do it

3.2.2 I'm assuming it's out of date and that's why it's not auto updating?

What do you mean went?
Do I have to send it through the send/receive protocol there's no way to transfer?

History just has the one received note, for +4.6 Which is my balance.  
I sent two payments, this one, of 0.0046 BTC to know that it was safe to send to my wallet (correct details) as well as the second transaction a week later of 0.0958 BTC to the exact same details.  
These both left coinbase, but I only see the one transaction in my history?
