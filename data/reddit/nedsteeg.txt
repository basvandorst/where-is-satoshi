You might be right about this being potentially ephemeral but it still matters because  unfortunately is a de facto authority when it comes to newcomers who can’t tell it’s just an impersonation. So eventually it does matter a bit I believe and also I find this rather entertaining ;)

Hello there! ��
I'm the CEO and co-founder of [Spot]( Today I'm thrilled to share with you the product that we've quietly been building for the past few months...
⚡️Spot ⚡️is an iOS &amp; Android app that gives you an aggregated view of all your wallets &amp; exchanges. You can automatically import all your trades &amp; transactions as well as monitor the prices of the entire cryptocurrency market.
My co-founders and I are all passionate about blockchain &amp; cryptocurrencies and there is one thing we all lacked: a powerful yet easy to use interface to manage our cryptos. So we teamed up with the idea to build the transparent, safe and user-friendly product we've always dreamt of as long time crypto believers.
Today our apps are entirely native on iOS &amp; Android and we have built our own market data API by connecting directly to more than 150 exchanges. We have recently raised a seed round from amazing founders of companies like Ledger, eFounders or Trainline. In the coming months, we will introduce some major features like trading and transactions ����
We have received many amazing and useful feedbacks from our beta testers so far and now we can't wait to move onto the next stage and get even more feedbacks from you guys!
Let me know if you have any questions ��

Although my words might not mean anything to you, I can assure you that we are not sharing or selling any data.
We don’t require login or identification and the data we collect is entirely anonymized and encrypted. For example all the users’ API keys are stored locally on the device and never sent to our servers.
We also want to ensure that we are giving our users correct data. For example we've rebuilt CoinMarketCap from the ground up, to be free from any intermediate between exchange rates and our users. But even with that, you know that some of these exchanges are manipulating their data (especially the volume through wash trading). One of our goals is to understand how these manipulations impact the volume, and then display the right numbers to our end-user.
On the other side, there are numerous services which give blockchain data and we are using some. But we do have our own nodes we operate to cross-check and be sure the data is effectively what is on the blockchain.
Going through the Apple and Google app stores for now still seem the best way to democratize crypto. We believe that it is the best way to quickly bring a powerful, secure and reliable experience to our users.
As we grow we want to open source &amp; decentralize what can be so you can verify rather than just trust us.
