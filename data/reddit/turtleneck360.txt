Yes. Ideally you’d sell enough to cover your initial investment plus 30-40% in capital gains tax.

Percentages are going to vary but mutual funds are considered safe long term investments. Real estate is another good option. These won’t give you anything in the short term but historically has shown to grow 2 times or more in value near your retirement age.

When people were guessing which altcoin would be added to Coinbase, many people guessed and wanted XRP. There are many other coins that seem to be more popular.  Why do people want Ripple added to CB?

A good credit history requires a good range of credit aside from revolving credit lines (credit cards). The old saying that all debt is bad may be true to simplify things for most people. But it’s much more complicated.

This is dangerous investing. If all it takes is simply to throw money at small companies then many people would be wealthy. You need to view what you’re doing as playing the lottery. Buying a bunch of lottery tickets would make you rich as long as you hit one right? But most people don’t put much into lottery or at all because the likelihood is so minuscule. It’s a much safer choice to keep putting into your 401k. Crypto and stock market gambling should be a small portion of your investment portfolio.

Yeah people harping on if they only bought btc when it was $10. Well realistically if you owned 300 btc when it was $10, you would have also sold when it was somewhere around $50 or $100. No rational person would hold it for this long when they saw a 5-10x growth. Most of the people hitting it rich are people who bought and then never bothered to look at btc prices until recently.

Gdax showed it briefly flirted with $20k. Is this accurate?

This alternative reality that you're living in, how much is Bitcoin in that reality?
@_date: 2017-12-12 02:53:02
Yes, it can vary wildly but to be conservative, I stated 30-40%. Some states even assess around 10% on capital gains based on income, and then there's the 3.8% Obamacare fee. So it can, at minimum, hit 30% easily if you live in certain states.

Yup. I’ve had perfect credit for awhile with revolving credit lines but at some point my score never really improved. After my first car loan, my score made huge leaps.

The banks best position is getting your monthly payments AND get the house if you default. They have some type of collateral so the idea that they have no clue what they’re doing is stupid.

Crypto down across the board. I’m curious to know what is causing this. Seems pretty well timed.

It's scary how many people are jumping into Bitcoin only seeing the hype without internalizing the risks. Someone said they cashed out their 401k for Bitcoin. Uh wtf?
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:30:24
My guess is the whales are spooking the new bitcoin investors that came in at $10k. Imagine how many coins they swiped when it hit $9k momentarily.

There is no one on the "inside". It's within everyone's own interest to promote people hold onto their bitcoin or else its value would drop. He could simply be someone promoting his own interest to sell high, and buy low as bitcoin rises. If people believe and expect a bubble, they definitely would not hold onto their coin, thus hurting his bottom line. Take everything people say with a grain of salt.

You mean I can't buy a house soon with my 0.03 bitcoin? :(

I initially came to this subreddit for quality posts with quality opinions. But this subreddit is 95% memes. Comes off as super immature and reinforces the idea that only young, inexperienced people believe in bitcoin. Not the greatest impression when the goal is much more serious.

I bought in at $10,200 and then within seconds it plummeted to $9000. Lol. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:24:57
To do this, you have to ignore math and common sense. Both things have proven to be reliable. I'm fairly new to the scene but last night I watched as Bitcoin tried to push past $9,000. It hit a huge wall around $9,200. A few minutes later, within a split second, someone dumped a huge amount to push it back down below $9,000. Yes, all of this is normal strategy in the stock market world. But it shows me the manipulation is very real in getting Bitcoin to a certain number. Once those big players pull out, you will get dicked pretty hard. The only question is when will they pull out.

That’s not the point. Looking in hindsight is pointless because no rational person would continue to hold if their original investment doubled, tripled, or quadrupled. The only people who actually held are very small and mostly because they forgot they owned some or did not bother to track the price.

There’s a lot of blame to go around. The media is probably the smallest portion. The biggest is the guy for being stupid enough to invest in his credit card. The second are the moon kids who can’t say anything but HODL and MOON. 
I’d like to take this time to push why regulations are important. In a perfect world, we’d all have critical thinking skills but the reality is there needs to be laws to protect people from their own stupidity. That’s why there are warnings on bleach bottles and laws in stock markets to protect the consumer. I don’t know what would protect this guy but it sucks to be in his position whether or not you feel he’s ultimately responsible.
