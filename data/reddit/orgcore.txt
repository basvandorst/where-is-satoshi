No. Gatekeeping would be "if you buy a puppy instead of adopting, you know nothing about dogs"

The world is ending if USD were to crash, so it won't really matter.

This is such a false equivalency...hardly anybody in the US owns enough video game gold to be meaningful.
Anyway, this bill doesn't mean anything. If you make money off Bitcoin investments, pay your taxes like you should be. If you make money off RuneScape gold, pay your taxes.

Clitcoin hodlers in a single sentence.  All it needs is a mention of taking out a mortgage to buy more.

All these professionals going on television and speculating about Bitcoin are cringy.
They sound like 14 year olds trying to figure out if their crush likes them back.

We can have different purposes for holding bitcoin you know. Not all of us are 17 year old suburban libertarians who just read The Fountainhead for the first time...
