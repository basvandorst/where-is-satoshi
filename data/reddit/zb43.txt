Applying mathematics and reasoning like this is ignorant. Environmental features and changes in the market will drive a change in the price, not some old guy doing maths in a basement.
e.g. if every country banned bitcoin tomorrow the price would probably drop below 1k.
I always get worried about the criminal origins of BTC, and how it is the currency of the deep web and such. Governments or agencies could see the adoption of bitcoin as supporting terror or illicit behaviors.

can someone please explain what a fork is, what all the different names mean, how it will affect the value of bitcoin etc? I am very new to bitcoin thinking of investing but trying to learn as much as possible. Why are there forks and what does it mean?

back when bitcoin was around $3100 I was going to put 5k in it. I came on this reddit and some guy told me to only buy if it hit ~2000$. Im sitting here today with no bitcoins and they are priced at 7200$
