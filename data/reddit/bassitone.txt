Oh hey, sure I'll give this a shot!
If it's better than the standard one that I don't particularly care for, what's there to lose?

Probably been asked numerous times, but could someone give a breakdown of the different wallet options?  By that, I am referring to the different options for desktop/Android.  I know the basics of web wallets, but this is my first real jump into BTC from altcoins that have only the qt wallet as an option.  Why/should I use multibit or armory over the base wallet?  Are they just as secure? 
Also, is there a foolproof walk-through on creating a paper wallet somewhere?  I tried to do it a while back, but creating the BIP-38 encryption part lost me...

Yup, same here.  Pay attention to your ROI calculations people.  I've accepted that mine won't ever hit that point (barring a huge increase in price without a corresponding increase in difficulty), but I didn't drop all that much on one and just view it as a neat hobby.
If you're actually hoping to get back more than you put in, 2 months might even be on the optimistic side for scrypt with the new power coming online

Wow, never seen an LTC tip!  I knew there had to be some, but never ran across it

...on Gox.  Stamp is still showing $581.  Damn it, got my hopes up!

American here.  I learned the metric system in school too.  That said, it's hard to generalize anything about American schooling because it's done at the state level (though I think things may be starting to move to a more standardized system...)  Metric is certainly not in a common use among Americans outside of the sciences though.  Many cars don't even have km/hour on the speedometer, even though driving to Canada or Mexico is fairly common depending on where you are. 
As for why people prefer bits over µBTC, probably just the ease of typing it.  I had to copy your micro in order to put it in.  I don't know the ASCII code for it, and I certainly don't know how to get it to show on my phone.  As others have said, mbtc is too vague (are you talking milli or micro?)  It's easy to say micro BTC, but honestly I don't get the chance to talk about (much less use) BTC outside the internet very often.

Uh, when I go to that url it's talking about a different bitcoin deal, not the one the sub has been going nuts about all weekend.

Been lurking for a while, dabbled in BTC a little bit.  Now I'm super excited to make the jump into really using/holding bitcoin beyond just a matter of curiosity.

Twitter speak for our Reddit PMs, but I love the connotations with this meaning.
Well done.

Man, I just moved from one state that they're taking customers to one that isn't on the list yet. 
Damn it.

Sounds better than some atm fees I've seen...

Just sent a little bit (heh) your way!  I'm just getting into this whole Bitcoin thing, but I couldn't think of a better thing to send my first transaction to!

Man, where the fuck is this bot living that 2 beers is $7.28?!
