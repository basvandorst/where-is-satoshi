A Futures Contract is an agreement about selling/buying goods like Bitcoin at a specific price on a fixed date in the future eg. I buy 1 BTC for 15000$ on 1.january 2019 ... if the price of original BTC is below 15000$ on that date the buyer loses money if its over 15000$ he gets a good trade rate

You Could ask on index sites like Craigslist if somebody wants to trade BTC for Cash in person

For a list of independent Wallets see Bitcoin.org

It keeps your Private keys on a non smart/ non internet enabled Hard Drive which makes it impossible to access it unless you have the hardware in your own hands ...

The ICANN and all it‘s DNS Providers can only change the web address „Bitcoin.org“ to not lead to the Bitcoin.org page... however the site would still be available under it‘s IP adress or by using DNS Redirect portals. Countrys could decide to block the specific IPs of Bitcoin.org which would force you to use an High Anonym VPN Service to access it like TOR. to cut it out of the Network entirely All Nations would have to agree upon this and Destroy / Cut Off the Physical Servers which Host the Site...

I use it on my phone for easy access when I want to make transactions in person. However it is not as secure as a full node or an Hardwarewallet so you should not be keeping high amounts in it for more than 1-3 days ...

Yes but if you try to make transactions from different devices in short periods of time you might not get verified as an eligble Transaction resulting in partial bitcoin loss...

Hard Wallets aren‘t Internet enabled since there is no network chip in them a unseroius criminal manufacturer could implement a call home function into the software that you install on your pc to set up the hard wallet and let it steal your Private Keys/ Phrase however that would be recognised by most antiviruses and is not a good business model in the long run...

Its generated by your wallet

The other way around... you just look for someone who wants to buy in Person or wait until your 18 and link your own bank account to an Exchange like Coinbase etc. To trade it will require you to identify yourself via ID Documents ... not sure if Coinbase accepts Jordaniens though might want to look on Bitcoin.org for further details.

If BITCOIN is generally adopted as an Payment Option in Stores Banks Restaurants etc. Even more people would want/need to get there hands on it wich would rocket up the Prices even more followed by a small crash to a level of stable worth which would ratify BTC as a Real Stable Currency
