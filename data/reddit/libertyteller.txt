Thank you for the feedback. We are incorporating every piece of helpful advice that we can. Our setup is improving every day, and was definitely done with permission by South Station's management (which we converted to bitcoiners, along with many others).

hopefully soon you won't have to decide between using cash for bitcoin or Anna's :)

yes! it's been there for a few months now. our ATM combined with the airdrop will hopefully drive a lot of awareness around bitcoin and digital currencies. should be many more local B&amp;M businesses announcing acceptance of it soon.

The paper wallets are a critical tool for onboarding new bitcoiners that want to try bitcoin out quickly. We are strongly encouraging people to use our tutorials at libertyteller.com/tutorials to transfer the bitcoin on their paper wallet to their digital wallet. That way our service is trustless, and the next time they can use their digital wallet. Our names, pictures and contact information are available on our home page, so you know who to talk to if you have any issues.

No trust required. Everything is instantly pushed to the blockchain.
