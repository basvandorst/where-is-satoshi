Also, on AUSTRAC/AML (Anti Money Laundering):
AUSTRAC will monitor any transaction over $10k to or from a foreign institution (I've had questions from them ... about 2 years after the transaction)
If the transaction happens locally (e.g. with a business such as the one I'm setting up) then the local organisation must be able to identify the customer - again for amounts over $10k for AML purposes. I'm unsure if there is any reporting requirement associated.
How this works for BTC / LTC etc. will be less clear given the variability in price relative to the $. A sensibly written modification would be that any transaction equivalent to $10k or more in value at the time would be subject to the same regulations. Whether it fell to AUSTRAC or AML would depend on the source of the transaction. The argument about the international nature is moot - if it's worth over $10k and you don't know the origin of the transaction (i.e. a AU or non-AU entity) you are on very shaky ground.

Note on tax status: I've been following what the ATO are up to as they seem to be leading the charge on this. 
Best case outcome is that they follow Singapore's lead and effectively treat it as a tradeable commodity with capital gains tax due on any gains (and suck up your losses). 
Worst case is they follow Finland's lead and buying / selling bitcoin is treated as trading in a good that is subject to GST - putting a 10% tax effectively on every attempt to pay with Bitcoin, which may end up being a double tax as you will still pay GST on the goods you are buying.
The ATO likely won't rule until closer to the end of the Tax year as they try to factor it in for this years returns. They only decided to think about it seriously this month.
