Sorry but why are we celebrating bitcoin losing approx 50% of its ATH value? Pretty much anyone who bought in the last month is seeing their bitcoin value just plummet. I'm a HODLer so I know I don't lose unless I sell but it's painful to watch and wait for a recovery. 
@_date: 2018-01-11 18:40:20
A 2-4mb block would not decrease centralization. It would however open the door for knee jerk block size increases in the future. I agree that layer 2 protocols are definitely the future of bitcoin and I firmly believe that a block size increase is inevitable... I just wish they could have done LN and a small increase at the same time. But then again that could diminish the "urgency" for LN. This is all politics and at the end of the day there is a need to increase of the block size in some form other than segwit.

OP I'm curious, how long did the tx to fund your channel take to confirm? You mention that it cost $2.40 to fund your channel but with current fees I am wondering why everyone else is paying $10+ fees if you could achieve the same with a $2.40 fee. Even with segwit that is a pretty "decent" fee for Bitcoin. I'm excited to see LN succeed but I'm circumspect of most things until proven otherwise.  Thx

You want smaller than 1MB blocks? We need a small block size increase (2-4mb) and LN. Best of both worlds and it won't affect decentralization.

@_date: 2018-01-11 18:04:09
Know that feeling. As a bit coiner since 2011, and knowing how the network used to operate, I think a block size increase is much needed... However, I agree that it's not the only solution needed. LN sounds very interesting and I'm excited to use it but I don't understand why they couldn't have upped the block size a little. It seems like such a simple, logical thing to do. I see it as an inevitable thing that is being unnecessarily delayed at the expense of "average" bitcoin users. I dont think anyone except the "big blockers" are asking for 1GB blocks. 2-4mb would be nice and shouldn't affect decentralization at all.  Why can't we all get along? lol.

I personally wouldn't buy off eBay and scratch off seed words but I can definitely see how it happened with the massive influx of new users who may not be as tech savvy as most of us. Bitcoin is a very complicated topic that I still struggle with after 7 years of using it and I have 11+ years as a Senior Systems Administrator under my belt. Just when I think I fully understand bitcoin something challenges my beliefs. It's sad this happened to someone... I really feel for him. It's surprising though that this didn't happen sooner or more often.

It's the original crypto so it has brand recognition, despite BCH's attempt to hijack the name. It is also significantly more secure than any other crypto due to the hashing power of the network. Plus the engineering that goes on behind the scenes is brilliant. Segwit, Multisig, lightening network, Schnorr signatures... all make 2018 a very exciting year for Bitcoin!

You’re clearly ignorant and need to see the world. I’m Canadian and have had the opportunity to visit and live in the USA, Mexico, Cuba and Portugal. I’m also a pilot so I’ve seen lots of the world. Finland and Dubai are beautiful places. Much nicer and safer than certain spots of the USA. I love USA but some of its people are so wrapped up in America being the greatest they don’t realize there’s a whole huge beautiful world to live in. We have some of the most beautiful landscape and lots of resources. Sounds like you need to get on a plane to open your eyes and mind. With that being said don’t come to Canada in the winter unless you’re snowboarding/skiing. And finally, I think it’s funny that some Americans think that Canada blames the US. We don’t have enough problems to care about blaming the US with one exception. Voting in Trump. The whole world including many Americans blame America for that. I find that some Americans blame the whole world including your current president: It’s Mexico’s fault, it’s the Muslims, Russians, China, etc. Why can’t we all just get along instead of mud slinging?

It’s a big circle jerk over there is what it is. Don’t get me wrong, I hold bcash myself in the off chance it sky rockets again, but their “community” is like a cult and rather than admitting they copy pasted bitcoin into another alt coin, they have the nerve to use bitcoins name and try to confuse people into buying their alt coin. Personally I have no problem with alt coins, I have a problem with misleading people while pretending they’re doing Satoshi’s work.

@_date: 2018-01-11 18:11:16
I seriously doubt the bcash crew have the technical ability or resources to "destroy" BTC. The feeling I get when I go there is that I'm among a much younger group of people who are newer to the crypto game and are "rebelling" against the more mature generation of crypto (ie BTC) . Not to say there aren't some decent, mature people over there, but it's the feeling I get from their posts and tactics. Case in point, could you picture Andreas orchestrating the childish failed attempt that was the "flippening" ?  They focus too much time and energy on mud slinging and convincing themselves that their coin is the "real" bitcoin. I see benefits to bcash but their sub puts me off big time. 
@_date: 2018-01-11 18:33:31
Even if they're technically competent enough to pull that off, which I strongly doubt given the complexities that the core team is facing, wouldn't (bcash + tx malleability fix + LN) = BTC ? The only benefit they have from my point of view is larger blocks but I'm guessing that an increase will inevitably come in time for BTC after they resolve their other priorities.

If they were a responsible company I think a better question is what benefit would it have for their customers? Possibly lower (or free) tx fees to withdraw from them. Which would result in more profits for them. My exchange in Canada, QuadrigaCX, charges 0 fees and they batch tx's like crazy. They have nowhere near Coinbase's volume either and they are insanely profitable.

I started using bitcoin in 2011 and I’m still trying to understand parts of it so kudos to you for taking the leap into LN. I just don’t see the need for it quite yet as BTC layer 1 works fine for the most part.

BTC enthusiast since 2011 here... been HOLDing for a long time. And to be fair, it's not a fantastic strategy. It's the safest bet, but it's actually the worst investment strategy. If you are able to see a market correction coming, either by hunch, or seeing it start to happen using TA, you can greatly increase your position by selling as the knife starts to fall and buying back in when it hits bottom. If you sell 3 bitcoin at $10k each and buy them back at $5k that's doubling your position. Much better strategy then HODLing. Problem is it's risky... but so is crypto. 
@_date: 2018-05-19 23:38:26
But the goods and services we buy have their price in USD so we must always be measuring against it. 1btc could buy a trip to Dubai one day or 1.5 the next so we cannot simply measure only in btcs. Until there is more mass adoption and less volatility we will always see prices in USD. I would love to see things priced globally in bitcoin but I don’t see that happening any time soon. 
@_date: 2018-06-30 06:44:07
You're absolutely right. I hope the money I have invested/saved has value by sitting in cold storage. But I discovered bitcoin in 2011 and I used to spend it much more frequently then I do now. At one point I used Bitcoin for over 60&amp; of my monthly spending. Then we got caught up in the price and how bitcoin shouldn't be used as a currency but it's a GREAT store of value. The other sub is terrible but they have one positive trait and that is they want to use their alt coin that they call bitcoin as currency. We could learn a lesson.

Long time BTC hodler here and friend of this sub. Need to disrespectfully disagree. The USD value is what attracts the average non tech person to Bitcoin so it’s very important. I’ve been lucky for the most part but it’s not easy to see your investment go down significantly. It’s even harder to take advantage of a market downturn. I’m making 1BTC turn into more then 1 by selling a portion of my holdings and buying when it’s lower. Focusing on the dollar loss is painful but if you can see the opportunity to increase your holdings, even if you’re selling at a loss, you can still buy more BTC cheaper when this correction bottoms out. Just my 2 satoshis. HODLing is not a wise investment strategy. It’s just a safe one that has worked only because BTC has always recovered. What if that doesn’t happen again any time in the near future. HODLing in that case will only hurt. Increase your positions people!

This is probably not going to be a popular opinion but I wholeheartedly disagree you should pay taxes on crypto. Hear about the massive scandal that Quadriga CX customers are facing in Canada? Taxes paid on crypto gains did fuck all for us. Some guys are out $300k+  and paid taxes. Got them no assistance from the government. The RCMP (similar role as the FBI) has done fuck all despite the mounting evidence of fraud/embezzlement. Why should the government get your tax dollars for something they have fought tooth and nail against and which they offer no consumer protection?

Use Via BTC's transaction accelerator. Google it. I used it the other day after 24 hours of no confirmations. I had to use it twice before the first confirmation comes in . You need to put your txID in the accelerator within the first few minutes of the hour as they only allow a certain amount of requests per hour. Hope your tx confirms.

@_date: 2018-02-05 20:06:26
Developing a second layer solution on top of an base layer that doesn’t affect security of the network or your coins SHOULD take time. I want it to take time. I have too much money at stake for sloppy knee-jerk programming. I do however think they should have increased the blocksize a bit as a stop gap to SegWit adoption and LN. Bcash could have been avoided and a lot of the negative press bitcoin is receiving recently about fees could have been avoided. Problem is that just upping the blocksize sets a precedence that we can just increase the size and not work on more effective/innovative ways to scale the Blockchain. 
@_date: 2019-01-16 15:39:20
Automatic sweep could work if they implemented a way to verify that address is legit. I'm envisioning something similar to how PayPal sends 2 micro transactions to your debit/credit card and you have to verify the amount received. That's all it would take to relieve Kraken of any liability in regards to sending money that was swept.

2009 is a  long time in the tech world. I’ve seen corrections happen and bitcoin “die” over and over. I’ve been able to afford to finance getting my pilots license and most of the cost of buying a plane. The remaining funds needed will happen when this correction turns around. I’m not regretting anything. Bitcoin has changed my life.  I’m not rich I’m just doing well. It will be ok buddy. I think a lot of people here are new and been burnt and need to tell themselves it’ll be ok. What I don’t get it you laughing at me saying that since 2009 is a long time.... but then you go on to say that you’ve been watching whats been happening for the last 6 months.

Sure it is long term. It's increased consistently year over year since it's launch in 2009. It's up over 1000% since last year all without a bank giving us "interest" on our savings. That is a great store of value to me. It seems there are a lot of alarmists or new people here who joined in during ATH's who are now freaking out when they see such a big, overdue, well needed correction. Bitcoin doesn't have to, but it always has recovered. All this shit talk about it being useless as a currency and too volatile just make BTC that much more volatile as people panic sell when they see FUD posts. It'll be ok ... it'll be ok. If you don't feel that way then go watch some Andreas Antanopolis talking about the tech behind bitcoin and if you're like a lot of us here, you'll feel much better and less concerned with the price.

Wrong. PayPal presently is a bit more convenient for making small purchases but it is definitely not more secure than bitcoin. Sending money of any substantial value is not a good use case for PayPal but it is for bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:15:09
This! I think they’re all butt hurt they got left out and use a natural and overdue correction to rub it in our faces. I’ve been in the bitcoin game since 2011 so I’ve seen these types of price movements many times. The storm is hard to weather but knowing bitcoin has always found a way to recover is what gets me thru... that and firmly believing in the tech. 
@_date: 2018-02-23 18:55:41
You might be right. But don't confuse a crypto based economy with a deflationary currency. Bitcoin is deflationary, but crypto isn't necessarily. I can't see a government like Venezuela implementing a deflationary currency with strong consensus rules like Bitcoin. I see them wanting the ability to control and print more crypto coins at will. I could be completely wrong though as I'm entirely speculating.

Looks very nice and exactly what I've been looking for! Downloading it now and can't wait to check it out. I see a post about adding more exchanges if feedback is positive... if there's any way to add QuadrigaCX support for Canadian's it would be greatly appreciated and would go a long way to getting more users on board. Canadians are very crypto-savvy and QuadrigaCX is the dominant exchange here. They have an easy to API from my understanding... I have not personally used it. Good luck!

I think you’re insanely naive to believe that. I honestly think Satoshi is dead. He came out of the woodwork to say he wasn’t Dorian Nakamoto but now he’s silent when the crypto world is going nuts with forks and forks of bitcoin with everyone claiming they know what’s best for bitcoin and claiming they’re following his real vision. That and he has billions of dollars worth and nothing has been touched. In my mind he’s clearly dead or destroyed his private keys to btc and possibly all his accounts.

Buying drugs on the darknet, SilkRoad originally, was the first major use case for Bitcoin IMO. Edit: Now it's way more than that but im talking "back in the day" in 2011-2013. 
@_date: 2018-02-17 18:58:20
I feel this is underrated. Everyone talks about HODLing which in the long run might be the "safe" bet but selling on a correction and buying lower can increase your position significantly. I wish I had realized this before the knife fell this time. I will be doing this next time.

Not sure where you’re located but here in Toronto, Canada, the only “legal” way to get cannabis is having it mailed to you from a licensed producer like Tweed, MedReleaf, etc. And we can get alcohol mailed to us in the mail. Are you in the US? 
@_date: 2018-02-09 10:10:07
Interesting to compare the differences between countries! We can get liquor and cannabis mailed to us. To legally buy medical cannabis you have to order it thru a licensed producer and they legally have to mail it to you. At the moment there is no way to purchase cannabis without it being mailed... that being said we have dispensaries that operate on the sidelines in a grey area until federal recreation legalization in summer 2018.  When they deliver alcohol or smokes they just mark on it that you have to verify age over 19 (our drinking age in  Ontario). It’s pretty convenient !

It was my assumption that the reference client is more heavily used by backend services rather then end users. But on that note didn’t the older version of core client support SegWit via command line which is how SegWit adopters are using it now (probably an API call actually). My point is that it’s good news for sure that the GUI supports SegWit. Any method available to gain adoption is good, but I don’t think this is as huge for SegWit adoption as say Coinbase rolling out SegWit. Do you agree ?

More people have access to cell phones in undeveloped (and developed) nations unlike banks. With bitcoin all you need is a cell phone. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 23:24:15
It’s definitely not a thing if you can’t access the banking system like in many parts of the world. Even in western countries there are people who cannot get bank accounts. Crypto changes all that. And even the people with bank accounts are not safe from their accounts being skimmed like in Greece or frozen when the government doesn’t like your actions. If you cannot fathom what I am talking about you are in the wrong forum bud.

Haven't looked into the Petro in detail but what IF their government allows it to be mined and issued ad-hoc. Kinda like tether. lol. Then it just becomes another inflationary currency hiding under the guise of crypto.

I saw that scam the other day on Charlie Lee's twitter account . it was pretty convincing at first the way the impersonator used an almost identical looking account and there were even people "vouching" that it worked. There was even a fake page which looked like it had incoming small ETH amounts and outgoing huge ETH amounts. What gave it away, besides being too good to be true, was that the last transaction was 9 seconds old and it never updated on the page. lol.

I realize that having possession of the hardware running the node is the most secure way to run a node but I don’t know if I agree with a cloud node doesn’t count as a real node. Either way they’re seeding the network and verifying txs just one you don’t have physical access to. IMO. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:48:56
I agree mostly with what you said. Just want to add that they only got screwed if they sold. The people who lost money did so because they got in at an ATH and then a well overdue correction happened. If they HODL they will be safe long term. 
@_date: 2018-02-22 21:19:54
This is definitely good news but how many people actually use the reference client as their wallet?

Really? Thats what happened last year? It rose the whole year "and in the end months" it went down? Cuz I saw it rise, fall, rise most of the year and then in the "end month" it rose to an all time high and has fallen since. January/February 2018 are the months of crypto fallout. 
@_date: 2018-02-15 18:20:54
Yes the hostile takeover attempts from bcash are shady and despicable but the crypto/fiat trading pairs don't make something a "shitcoin". Your logic is very immature and flawed. First of all, by your logic Bcash, Etherium, Litecoin, and Bitcoin Gold are NOT shitcoins because I CAN buy them with fiat. My exchange has all of the above trading pairs. They are ALT-coins not shitcoins. In my opinion there's nothing wrong with alt-coins as long as they are hippocratic and don't harm the progress of crypto or specifically bitcoin. Which leads us to Bcash which has actively attempted to damage bitcoin and THAT could justify calling it a shitcoin. I see no reason why a handful of "major" cryptos can't be harmoniously living together and serving similar but different functions.

I hope you're right ... but why do you assume he would have wised up by now and sold OTC? The only thing that I think is safe to assume with anything to do with mtgox is that they are fools and seem to have a way of crashing the markets over and over. I sincerely hope they sell OTC but we will have to wait and see.

I cant speak for Venezuela (I can barely spell the countries' name! lol) but I know that many other developing nations have pretty decent cellular infrastructure. When I visited Cuba this Christmas i was able to get EDGE/3G signal in most places. I suspect many developing nations in South America have access to cheap cellular service. Mexico is much more developed then other nations but to demonstrate my point, they can get cellular plans for $5-10 a month there. Don't underestimate a countries communications infrastructure  just because they're "developing".

TREZOR is the best long term suggestion. But if OP is in an urgent situation it won’t be fast enough. Change your exchange passwords, and get your coins OFF the exchange ASAP. Send them to a paper wallet ideally but that can be complicated if you don’t understand how to create/use one. If I were in your situation I would send the coins to a wallet where I control the keys. Jaxx is a good one IMO. Act swiftly but smartly.

Why is the ETF interest driving this bull run? We had ETFs in the past that did nothing to help bitcoin... no? CME comes to mind. I don’t quite understand all of it though.

The deflationary aspect of bitcoin was one of the many things that attracted it to me in 2011. And then BCH and all the million altcoins happened and I realized that inflation found a way. Yes BTC will be limited but something about BCH forking and there suddenly being two Bitcoins made me realize that someone will always find a loophole.

I would guess that they have a mechanism in place to make sure txs are always verified. Probably part of the fee you pay to deposit ensures that an appropriate tx fee is paid to make sure it’s confirmed.

Or you could just buy a hardware wallet. Forget all this paper wallet nonsense. The way I see it paper wallets are only good for gifting small amounts of bitcoin. I used it last Christmas to give friends and family some bitcoin. I'd never store large amounts on a paper wallet. 
@_date: 2018-12-20 15:27:59
Because paper wallets can cause people to loose money if you don't do it properly or loose that paper. You need to be technically skilled to sweep a paper wallet. I gave out 6 paper wallets last year... only one of them was swept due to that person being more technical then the rest. Everyone else just HODL'd out of ability to sweep their wallet. I think anyone that puts a large figure on a paper wallet is nuts... it's literally putting all your eggs in one paper basket. If you have more crypto then 2x-4x the cost of a hardware wallet then it's definitely worth the investment IMO. 
@_date: 2018-12-20 15:22:58
Ya but BitPay's implementation is proprietary... even if you can figure out the real BTC address to send to, Bitpay will reject your payment due to it not being sent from a Payment Protocol enabled wallet. That's bullshit and isn't bitcoin. It's almost like a layer ontop of bitcoin that excludes everyone except a few. Sounds centralized to me. 
@_date: 2018-12-20 01:18:11
I could never get that working properly. I managed to get the BTC address to send to... but when I sent the funds it said something along the lines that transactions from non Payment Protocol wallets were not supported and that funds would be sent back where they came from. Bitpay's usage of Payment Protocol is NOT bitcoin. As far as I'm concerned Bitpay is some shady third party proprietary payment processor using bitcoin's name and blockchain to make payments to some vendors who are stupid enough to fall for their guise. The payment Protocol is a fucking joke and is not bitcoin. Rant over.
