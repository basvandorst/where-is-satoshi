I had trouble understanding bitcoin myself, and therefore stayed away from it, but what made me understand it, if shinny metals and compressed carbons pieces have huge markets, eg. gold has a cap of 7 trillions and bitcoin is just 150 billions, and just work why bitcoin would not also work, even when you buy gold jewellery or diamonds, in the back of your mind is the resell value, (hedge against inflation), not that they look much better than a fake, or the coated version.
Maybe in US inflation isn't a problem but in my country until a few years 7% inflation was low, although maybe the official inflation is low, but as far as I know asset prices have gone up due to quantitative easing.

I don't think there is any EU exchange that doesn't do AMC/KYC.

It always bugged me that breadwallet while claiming opensource there is no way to know that the github repo is the app itself, while initially the owner promised deterministic builds he didn't followed through. 
So the actual seeds could not be random but follow some formula, there was an etherum wallet who did this trick, not saying that is that so, but we just don't know, although in this case could be someone stealing the seed from ipad.

No, the bitaddress.org.html file is static, doesn't pull code on the fly from npm or anywhere else and there are no new builds in 2 years and this issue is fairly recent.
