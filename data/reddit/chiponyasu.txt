He's kind of not answering the question, though. It won't be attackers who decide if bitcoin is obsolete, it'll be bitcoin users. At some point, "buy bitcoin and HODL" won't be a reasonable thing to do (it can't go up infinitely, after all), and what happens then? Does it become a stable currency? Do the investors all cash out and cause a crash? If there is a crash, who stays around with Bitcoin? These are the questions that matter, not attacks from altcoins.

You can turn cryptocurrency into fiat just by selling it, and then convert fiat into different fiat, different crypto, or goods and services.

As someone who's been fairly negative on bitcoin these last few weeks, let me turn around and say that the best time to buy bitcoin is when everyone's making fun of you for it, and the worst time to buy is when "buy bitcoin!" becomes conventional wisdom. 
Some people are gonna HODL, some people are gonna buy now that it's low, some think it'll go lower and plan to buy then (personally I'm waiting for it to go under 9k and then reddit will be full of sad Vegeta memes for a bit and maybe that'll cause a big dip), some are out entirely because they think the crash is real and permanent, but I think there's a lot less of the "I'm gonna take out two mortgages because Bitcoin is going straight to $100k in the next year I can't lose BAY-BEE!" mentality, which is probably a good thing for a lot of people in the long run, because now investors are a little more awake to the possibility of a long, shitty period (even though this period really isn't all that long or shitty) and aren't flying ships they can't lose.

Might be worth buying a *little*, but I'm waiting. Bitcoin's always been high-risk high-reward, but it seems unusually risky right now. 
I feel like it's going to have another big rally at some point, and then another big dip, but I don't know when it'll happen. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:41:23
In decreasing order of likelihood 
1. Bitcoin's price goes way down, similar to [what happened to gold]( in 2012/2013. It slowly regains value, but takes years to get back to $10k, if ever. This wouldn't really be a "black swan", since every other chump on Reddit is predicting a crash, but it's still a possibility you should take extremely seriously if you have 100 btc or whatever and plan to live on it.  
2. Some kind of government action that fucks with Bitcoin in some way, such as it being outlawed in China or something
3. Someone discovers a way to duplicate bitcoin, or some other major exploit (It's never been mathematically proven to be impossible. If I were retiring on bitcoin, I'd be fucking terrified of quantum computers.)
If you're retirement funds consist of 100 bitcoin, you need to diversify that shit posthaste. Even in the most optimistic bitcoin future, there's a 100% chance of the BTC markets getting at some point for some amount of time in the next 40 years. If you have stocks, treasury bonds, bank CDs, property, and bitcoin, then by all means live a little. If you're planning to live entirely on your bitcoin stash, you *will* get fucked at some point in your life. I'd say this if you were retiring entirely on stock, treasury bonds, or fiat, too. Shit happens, and will happen to any of it, which is why the first rule of investing is diversify. 
Edit: If you were ready to retire at 5k, you *probably* will survive even a larger crash, but still don't put all your eggs in one basket.

Yes. Bitcoin has value because everyone is HODLing it. As long as everyone else continues to HODL, you'll be fine. 
Bitcoin's price is entirely held up by the collective will to HODL, which sounds like a meme but is entirely true. That's the *only* reason Bitcoin's price has shot up in the last few months while functionality identical alt-currencies didn't.

The idea that supply creates its own demand is not [generally accepted by economists]( and it certainly doesn't work the way you're phrasing it. Even if I want a new PS4, I can buy it in Dollars or Bitcoins or Swiss Francs. I don't need dollars specifically. 


Yes, they want to buy bitcoin with dollars so that they can sell it for more dollars in the future. The price goes up, so more people buy it in hopes of selling at a profit, which causes the price to go up. The price of Bitcoin can't go up infinitely, so eventually it'll stop growing, and the speculators will cash out, which will probably cause a crash. 


Of course there are doubts. There could be a market crash followed by all the speculators leaving forever. Dogecoin could become more popular (since it's *exactly as good.* There's *literally no reason* Bitcoin is the "premier" crytpocurrency except that it's more popular). Someone could discover a way to hack it. Growth could stall out. A million things can happen. Hell, if there's a recession, a lot of people will leave Bitcoin in search or more stable investments.

You're assuming the fault is even with GDAX's systems at all, which isn't a safe assumption. They probably have technology partners. In Forex, we had to work with banks, but I'm not going to speculate on GDAX's setup beyond "it's probably complicated".

Not necessarily "for that good".

I would, actually, since the way I learned it was that a "demand for currency" meant a demand for savings. 


Literally ask anyone on this board. Even the HODL people aren't planning to literally hodl *forever*. They're waiting for their moons. 


The most famous market bubble in human history is tulips, and tulips aren't worthless, you can still buy them today. The stock markets crash all the time, even though the stocks usually still have some value. Gold crashed in 1980, but it's still like $1000/oz. 


It won't crash in the "becomes literally worthless" sense, but in terms of "the prices goes down and doesn't recover for a really long time or maybe ever", all the speculators leaving will absolutely do that.

Man, it feels like yesterday Bitcoin was at $9,000, but that was actually [two days ago](
The price of bitcoin is rising at 5% *per day*! That means that one of the following scenarios will likely happen
1. The 5% a day trend continues, and Bitcoin will hit $20,000 USD in the next two weeks 
2. The price increases speed up, to the moon! 
3. The trend flatlines, and Bitcoin stops rising. Speculators pull out, stop-losses get hit, and the price begins to fall. 
4. As above, but the prices falls really fast and it's a crash.
I have no idea what the relative probabilities of these four options are (well, I have *some* idea, but I'm not an expert), but I caution everyone buying bitcoin to make sure you have stop-losses set so that you'll sell automatically if the price falls to a certain point, instead of waking up one day and missing the chance to get out with most of your money intact. That's true regardless of what you think will happen to bitcoin. Be safe, and always wear a condom while trading.

Well, obviously, bitcoin can't rapidly rise forever. At some point, it'll go down by some amount. 
Is Bitcoin *really* four times as big now as it was back in May? Is the shooting up in value *really* a reflection of the fundamental market forces below bitcoin? Or are there are a lot of speculators pushing the price up? 
At some point, you might see, say, Bitcoin crash to $3000, and then be back up to $4200 a week later and rise slowly from there (a lot of times, when something crashes, it crashes too hard and shoots back some of the way up). Or maybe it'll go up to like $40,000 next year and crash *real* hard. Or maybe it'll have a soft pop to like $6000. Maybe it gets to $X in value and then flatlines for a long enough that all the speculators pull out. But it certainly won't be quadrupling in value every eight months. At some point between now and the heat death of the universe, shorting bitcoin will be a real good idea. 
Now, *when* that is, who fucking knows, and that's the most important thing, isn't it?

When everyone's talking about how the price is going up up up is probably the worst time to buy, because the fever is peaking. If you're buying now, you should be prepared to sell in the not to distant future, even if you plan on buying it all back once the decline is over. 
When Bitcoin crashes (and it will, at some point, crash) and everyone's sad and broke and miserable, that's when you buy, if you just want to hold long term.

That's called speculation. 


[Gold actually did have a crash of 2013, and slowly lost value over the next two years]( There's zero reason to believe Bitcoin will his a "true" price and then flatline. People are buying it to ride the wave, not because they care about the "true" value of cryptocurrency.

One thing to consider is that the more Bitcoin shoots up in value, the *less* useful it is an an alternative currency. As a currency, Bitcoin is undergoing massive, brutal deflation, which means everyone's got a real strong incentive not to purchase things with bitcoin since that bitcoin will be way more valuable in the future.

Inflation-adjusted price of gold in 1970: $226

Also, I'm sure your choice of 1970 as a starting point (when gold was at its lowest and right before 1970s inflation) is entirely unbiased

No one's buying bitcoin because they think it's worth $9k. They're buying because they hope they can sell for $10k. Once the price flatlines, all the speculators will sell their bitcoins and invest in something else, and the price will crash. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 06:27:11
Well, they're going to all take them off at once, because once the first wave hits, the price will go down. Then any competent trader will have a stop-loss set up, so those will start triggering, and the price will go down more and then the average trader will see the prices dropping and panic, and that's how crashes happen. 
Also, a lot of traders are using the same few EAs, so there are a huge amount of traders out there with "automatically sell if the price falls to $X" set up, all using the exact same value of X. I worked in Forex for a few years and I saw it a lot.

No, it's not similar. People want gold engagement rings, gold satellite parts, gold fillings, gold jewelry, gold in electronics, etc etc etc. That's the reason there's a demand! If the only use for gold was as a currency/"store of value", then it probably *would* be worthless at this point. 
There's nothing Bitcoin can do that, say, Dogecoin can't. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 05:07:12


I have a bachelor's degree in economics, actually (though I got it ten years ago and work in an unrelated field, so I'm a bit rusty). And my point isn't that there's no demand for bitcoin, obviously there is. The demand is speculation. There's not a single goddamn person on earth buying Bitcoin at $9k because they think it's worth $9k. They're buying it because they think it'll be worth $10k in a few months and they can sell it for a profit. At some point, bitcoin will stop going up. All the speculators will cash out, driving the price down. People will see the price going down, get nervous, and sell, causing the price to go down, and creating a vicious cycle where people sell because people are selling. 
Bitcoin isn't going to, like, get to $12k and stabilize there. It *will* crash. That doesn't mean it's the next beanie babies or anything, it'll just crash to a lower price. Because when the price of a market asset increases by 1,000% in under a year with literally no on-the-ground change to justify it, there's *probably* a bubble. 


I was making a point though. No one uses gold as a currency because the value rockets up and down by an order of magnitude more than fiat currencies do. In 2013, gold saw 33% inflation. In 2017, bitcoin saw -1,000% inflation. And when it crashes, it'll have double-digit inflation. That's terrible for a currency you actually want to use as a currency. Bitcoin is an investment whose price is going up even as that very price movement is making it less effective at what it's supposed to do, because the people buying it aren't planning to use it as a currency; they're planning to flip it for profit. There's incredible deflation now. There'll be incredible inflation later. There'll be a crisis of trust after that because people won't believe btc can stay stable. 
There's a reason I can't walk into a store and buy some shoes with gold bullion, even if I could with Euro or Yen. Because gold moves around too much to be useful as a currency anymore. 


That's literally what I said, rephrased. 


No, no no no. They're buying it because they think it'll go up in price in the short term, allowing them to sell at a profit. The "true value" of bitcoin is totally irrelevant. I imagine there's a lot of people buying bitcoin believing it's *over*valued, but that it will be even more overvalued next month and as long as they sell before the beer runs out they don't care if Bitcoin is at $1k again in six months. If I were confident bitcoin would rise for three more months and then crash, I'd buy now and sell in two months.
