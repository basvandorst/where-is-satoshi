Thanks for clearing that up. Since I cannot be online 24/7, is it even worth having my own node?

Question -- if I have a lightning node, does it have to be constantly running? In other words, could I have a node running only when I'm using my laptop?

What exchange do you recommend to cash out my shitcoins?
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:35:09
My recommendation...

I would argue that the less you taste it, the better

Less than $50 away from eating his left ball!

Bitcoin's about to come...
is about to lose a ball

I sold out around $6800. Would like to get back in before we reach the moon
@_date: 2018-02-15 05:38:37
Sold at 6500, bought back in at 9700.

I've been looking at the EMA12 recently. [If it follows the green trend, I will regret not buying back in, but it could dip again... won't really know until it happens either](
@_date: 2018-02-15 05:52:59
Yeah, I'm still in the green. Now my 0 net profit moved from ~4000 to ~8000 :/
I was hoping that it would drop to 7K to buy back in.

Maximize losses!

Would you recommend Bittrex or Bitfinex?
@_date: 2017-10-12 02:32:29
So now the question, Binance or Bitfinex?

Is blockchain.info a safe wallet?
