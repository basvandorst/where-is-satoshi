Is that 10k spent over time? Or per purchase?

See this is where I am confused, you are correct in the fact I do mean specifically "buying" things by *spending* Btc. 
BTW, I am asking in reference of UK tax laws, not sure about the IRS.

you would need a lot more than $8000, you'd be better of just buying bitcoin with that $8k. 
Its been more profitable to just buy and hold bitcoin instead of individual mining for years now.

Very true, soon I'm going to go cold turkey from reddit and the bitcoin price.

But what would be the difference if I had say for example € Euros, then the value of the dollar and pound sterling plummeted while the value of the euro went up, when I now to go "spend" my euros, does that tax man count those as profits if I say buy a car or a house with my new high value euros?

If you have a DVD I want, and you say you will sell the dvd to be for 2000bits, and I send you 2000bits directly to your wallet, and you physically give me the DVD, are you saying that counts as me "Selling" my bitcoin?

We started 2017 off at $1000, I am really really nervous about today's price, that green bar looks like a flag pole.

Very frustrating, thank you for your apply, I will try to be more patient. 
I don't understand the down votes though I'm only seeking help as I feel in the dark.
