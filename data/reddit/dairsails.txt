That's not very exciting, think a market crash is scheduled next year or two, maybe then BTC will probably go up in relation

Hoping to hear something new is all, it was good advice

Or your group is so narrow minded as to actually believe there's no other way for economy to work as well as putting words in mouths reading what you've already decided not listening or trying to learn about other views.  There are inflationary cryptos, not backed by debt though, yet as far as I know. I'm sure someone could make one that's loaned into existence creating more debt than actual money, but that would be stupid. Instead we have a competitive free market of virtual currencies designed to function in different ways with different purposes.  Hopefully the ones best for social welfare win out, probably the profitable ones will win out, but that's good to.  If fiat actually failed in a snap and crypto took over, inflationary coins would be made to fill the credit void, bumpy road for them, but a quality coin will do it right in the end.  Fiat not gonna fail that fast though dumb hypothetical. BTC merely another way in the meantime. Poor people bought BTC and held, got rich beat inflation inequality and debt. Poor people hold us dollar - poor people poor.

Its working as designed.  That's the issue.  The corrupt unsustainable design. Perpetually rising debt inflation and inequality.

=92.242 trillion.
First statement incorrect 75 trillion value of global economy. US dollars that exist far less than that.  Probably less than the 19 trillion in debt owed

For 1600!?
@_date: 2017-05-26 11:58:54
Lol there's 74 trillion dollars that exists so would be pretty impressive 
@_date: 2017-05-26 19:35:03
Is relevant but also relevant that there's only around 11 trillion us dollars. So btc would have to have a larger market cap than the present global reserve currency

.16 btc?
