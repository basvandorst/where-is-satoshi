He actually killed a crypto with legal action - Coinye.

I did wonder if you'd been swamped. Just shows what a useful app this is :)

Tried to set this up but unfortunately when I paste in my API/Passphrase/Secret I click continue and nothing happens.. Not sure why, so after a few tries I gave up. Anyway, what I will say is that the app doesn't really feel very iOS-like, and would look nicer if it adhered to the design principles (i.e utilising the whole screen instead of a box with a background, using the standard "&lt; back" tag instead of the "go back" text) so that's something if you want to get more practice at iOS development.

That's awesome! Meanwhile I secretly buy bitcoin and don't tell my wife so she can't be mad at me.

Agree it's fake because banks don't just hand out mortgages without the collateral (e.g house) actually existing, but I'm pretty sure he's claiming  mortgage wasn't spent on a house but on bitcoin; presumably he'd be renting and using the bitcoin gains (because it can only go up) to pay the rent and mortgage.

Yep, I managed, but their webcam feature wasn't working for me in anything aside from Chrome, and verification was over 5 mins but I just left it going in the background. Did my second verification through gdax, so may be worth trying that? (it's probably identical, but maybe worth a shot)

The worse it gets, the more bitcoin I'll buy.

Damnit, prolly missed out on this one!

I moved the coins to gdax for free then withdrew to my wallet for free.

Also have a shared account, but I have a 0% interest credit card in my name with rewards for purchases (so gives me an excuse to use it for anything/everything) and that enables me to obfuscate what I’m paying for. Not saying it’s a good idea though.

They’re saying that when there’s an influx of newbies (dumb money) the market price is inflated and will crash. They’ll sell their coins, wait for the crash, then buy them back at a lower price. If they judge it right, anyway.

Thanks for the headsup. Just checked and this isn't what happens for me, so it's probably worth contacting them and seeing what's going on. 


That's how it's worked for me, without the extra charge on top.

I'm a new guy and it was a shitshow for me. Wanted to sell so I could buy in again lower so sent the coins in my wallet to gdax.. but that transaction still hasn't gone through so I've needlessly lost the fee and totally missed the dip. When I finally realised the transaction wasn't happening, I decided to trade my small amount of LTC for BTC and cash out but by the time I cashed out.. we were at the bottom of the dip, so had to buy back in higher. 
Didn't lose much in the end, but was definitely a lesson.

I forgot to move the little I had from MtGox. Good times.

 Aren't you looking at it backwards? AFAIK, with bonds the person buying the bond is lending the money with the government paying the interest. So now that the interest rate is negative, people buying bonds will be lending to the government but not getting the full investment returned. They're paying the government to hold their money.

I wouldn’t say it’s not worth it for dipping your toes into trading, but at the same time you have to consider the limited potential gains vs the time you’re putting into looking / analyzing your trades, and if you’re trading all of your holdings you’re more likely to get the FOMO when you’ve sold and BTC keeps rising. If you’re holding, be prepared for a very long hold.

I'm still pissed I sold all my XVG after the mining hack and botched hard fork. Surely that's a bad sign by any measure.. but nope, up it goes. FML
