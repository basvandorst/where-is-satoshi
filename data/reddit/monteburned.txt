It’s just like all the other drops this year, nothing unnatural about it. You’re a fucking jackass who can’t handle reality.
@_date: 2018-08-04 04:04:43
Last time you said you entered at $200. Get your story straight. Lol.
@_date: 2018-08-17 08:45:33

@_date: 2018-08-06 03:19:36
I caught you. You are a poor loser. You didn’t even know how mining worked until I explained it to you. You should’ve stayed out. You didn’t because you’re dumb and I’m smarter.
@_date: 2018-05-24 04:38:51
The fools on Reddit owe you and I both an apology and praise.
@_date: 2018-08-04 04:27:03
I thought you bought in for $400, asshole? But this old post says $200. You’re a dumb cunt. 
I’m glad you bought in so high at your fucking embarrassed to admit what your actual price is. I hope you went all in a few months ago. Keep HODLing, maybe you’ll make it back. Remember: according to your dumb ass, Bitcoin miners are nice people and will never allow pathetic retards like you to lose money.
@_date: 2018-08-20 21:06:15
You do know that you can sell and buy back later? If he sold at $13K and bought back today, he’d have twice as much BTC. 600 days is not tomorrow. It’s not even this year or next year.
@_date: 2018-05-24 21:11:26
Yes, the $ is some consolation. But you and I deserve more. We are the true victims here, look how they’ve treated us.

@_date: 2018-08-13 18:28:09

No. You should sell.

Sell on an exchange or buy some gold with it, end of story.
@_date: 2018-08-28 01:29:26
I wonder if the seller just put the comma in the wrong place? Maybe supposed to be $6,900 not $69,000?
@_date: 2018-08-04 23:43:45
You're a fucking loser. You got caught bitch. And going through your history -- it's clear you KNEW that Bitcoin was a losing investment. You thought it was a scam. But you just couldn't stop your dumb ass from buying at the peak!!!! You knew better you piece of shit!!! You fucking loser!!!! With your weak dumbass mind! You were one of the morons who bought from me when I sold! I'm so fucking happy right now. I love spending your money you fucking cunt.

My guess is no.

Not necessarily. If you had an email saying send BTC to a particular address and you can prove you sent it to that address, it’s a pretty open and shut case.

No, buyers don’t “need panic sellers desperately.” There are more than enough sellers already. What there are not enough of is buyers.

As you already know, if you sent it to the wrong wallet you are screwed. Surely the exchange has a record of which wallet you sent it to.

It’s called a descending triangle. A breakout is coming all right - a breakout down.
@_date: 2018-10-08 18:12:59
No. But if you think you were ripped off you should demand the exchange give you a refund.

Because you supposedly bought in for $200, Bitcoin is guaranteed not to drop below 2k? When you bought your Bitcoin did it come with a warranty?
@_date: 2018-06-23 05:41:10
Those hundreds of millions of Tether were used to buy bitcoin. Those guys are probably selling. They probably got their Tether for free. Tether was fake Monopoly money, and now they can sell Bitcoin for real money. The other group of people selling are probably investors who are beginning to realize most coins don’t work as advertised.

@_date: 2019-01-14 04:29:20
Your reasoning is entirely founded on the conclusion that the most efficient way for bitcoin mining to occur is through a natural monopoly. You provide very little support for that particular conclusion - one sentence by my count, and that sentence is not persuasive. 
99% of your write up simply assumes that conclusion to be true, and makes about a million other conclusions on the back of that assumption.

@_date: 2018-03-15 19:39:57
So I was right. You bought Tron. A lot. And you did lose on Tron. Your obv fake numbers are funny. You’d have me believe that I was right about every single thing about you - including that you are a massive Tron idiot - but somehow i was wrong about the $. Lol. Never. I’m glad you’re poor.
@_date: 2019-01-27 14:38:11
Cool idea. But depends on how much you’re spending. If you’re not giving over $1K, maybe also think about something like Monero. A gift of 10 Monero might sound better than 0.12 Bitcoin, or whatever it’d be. Unless you believe way more Bitcoin, which is fine.
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:32:46
Well, would you look at that. It’s first thing in the morning and the price is $7,300. “Trolls” make the best crypto traders.

It’s probably a good idea just in case.

If you go to Bitpay and download their wallet, you can just type in (“import”) all the seed words that you used at Bitcoin Armory, and then your Bitcoin should immediately and automatically appear in your Bitpay wallet.
Obv never tell anyone else what those seed words are, anyone can take your $ in the same way if they know those words.

The words Selling and BTC in the same sentence. Shocking.

You’re not just wrong. You’re very very wrong.
@_date: 2019-01-14 04:21:04
Sounds like a good plan. Personally too risky for me. An exchange just has to screw you once and not give you your withdrawal, stealing everything. I trust very few smaller exchanges not to do that.
@_date: 2019-01-02 20:36:06
@_date: 2019-01-05 23:18:30

@_date: 2019-01-07 22:22:56
Don’t do that. There is no better feeling than selling, and then buying even more BTC a couple days later with that same amount of $.
@_date: 2019-01-27 15:50:07
You know why stores say something costs $0.99 instead of saying $1? Because it sounds better. I deal with reality - people fall for that kind of shit every day, all the time. Even though it’s the exact same value in dollars, you can say you’re giving away 1,000,000 X or 0.0000000001 Y. What do you think is the better marketing decision?

You’d be surprised what exchanges get away with. Check the reddit of QuadrigaCX. Countless people waiting months and months for 6 figure withdrawals and all they do is whine to customer service!

Think about using your BTC to buy physical gold instead, which is delivered to you. In the USA, the online store JM Buillion accepts BTC and in Canada there’s SilverGold Bull. Also check out Vaultoro, which is the easiest way of trading back and forth from BTC to gold. But definitely transfer your $ to a BitPay wallet before you buy anything big online - it’s way easier.
@_date: 2018-04-09 14:52:33
