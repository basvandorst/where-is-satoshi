Okay, he knows about it, but couldn't name a date. There will be a post in the sub when the time comes. Should such an AMA be here in or at @_date: 2014-11-13 15:37:28
Well, we could start "tipping adventures"! So, in order to get more tippers together, we could go together to a subreddit (we already like) and tip here and there. Would increase exposure to the masses.

So it's like a showcase of how simple Bitcoin can be? I mean, it could be anything beside Bitcoins that get tipped to the other entity.
At first, I thought it's about creating many transactions, thus "generating traffic" which shows that people are using Bitcoin.

I think it might be because of black friday deals.

That makes sense. So ChangeTip is a big ledger, on top of a huge wallet. And since you have to be a user of ChangeTip to use their functionality, you are transferring Bitcoins from one ChangeTip account to another, but that does not need to be backed by a transaction.

Not really about Bitcoin, but I'm pretty sure I'll get an answer:
I watched a documentary about Stuxnet (the malware that was wrecking havoc in Iran). In the documentary they said, that the industrial control systems and the programmable logic controllers are not connected to the internet. Still, Stuxnet sent reports to two servers. How did Stuxnet establish an internet connection from those off-internet systems?
I assume it didn't. Stuxnet waited until a Laptop was connected to the PLC and then, when the laptop had internet acces, the outside servers where accessed.

Ok, I see. Thanks for the clarification. So it creates even more transactions than a transaction, which does not run off the blockchain? Those are called sidechains, right?
Am I doing this right? 10 bits
