Subprime morgages during the crisis is maybe one thing that comes close? I agree with your point, just out of interest.  
@_date: 2018-01-12 13:15:56
I agree with you on most points but what I don't understand is how people can miss this. Everyone knows that interest rates are too low, money supply is too big and people are chasing returns in every dumpster they can find. Its common knowledge at this point I would say. If it turns out to be a temporary hype and the market drops significantly over the next year, I will have lost a lot of confidence in market rationality, investors and governments.
@_date: 2018-01-31 23:02:15
So you blame the company or the bank for that? The money is frozen until she pays of the debt, plus administration time. Its a situation she is in only because of her own stupidity. You need to pay off your obligations, using cryptocurrency doesn't change that.

What is the point of this post
@_date: 2018-01-21 21:17:14
If I'm correct you dispute what is saying, namely that 


as you say that that has been tried in the past but hasn't worked out a single time. (preventing a doomed asset from crashing to zero)
The government stepped in (as a market force) to prevent the market value of cdo's from dropping, because of the banks and insurers that the government deemed too big to fail. Didn't the government successfully keep prices of these cdo's higher than there actual market value by buying them up on a grand scale?

What?? No, you’re completely wrong. People invest in safe stocks which pay regular dividends like Shell. Or in treasury bonds. This whole crypto thing is 99% gambling. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 13:18:48
Yea, but I'm pretty sure out of those thousand Buffet is the one with the best track record.
@_date: 2018-01-31 21:59:56
So why didn't she pay off her debt? Obviously companies will go after their money, what do you want or expect?
@_date: 2018-01-31 23:21:58
If she kept her money under her matress she probably wouldn’t have been able to take on the debt in the first place. 
@_date: 2018-01-07 12:47:07
That’s worrying

If you want it to be used, it’s bad news. If you believe that scarcity alone will drive up the price so you can make a profit in usd/eur/etc, it can potentially be good news.

You need to read a basic economics book.

@_date: 2018-08-14 22:37:33
I was aiming for a more basic macroeconomic book they give in college, I believe Animal spirits is more focused on behavioral economics. I’ve never read it though so I can’t really comment on that.

There’s taxes on the profits, he was avoiding those. 
@_date: 2018-06-24 16:39:44
It wouldn’t.  It would be rationalized as the banks, whales, Soros and your mom keeping the price low, so they can buy more for themselves. That’s been the story since the high, that’s going to be the story towards the end.

All you're saying is the result. I want to know how. How is the blockchain going to make the economy more transparent, fair, and immutable?

Will that change the economy or prevent wars? All the technology and use cases are a bit overwhelming for me.

What company has 50% margin? It’s entirely normal for bitcoin to drop 8% in a day, that’s your entire profit for most companies.

I can’t find it using google. Do you have a link for me?
@_date: 2018-03-11 14:27:33
Everything you say is based on the assumption/your conviction that everyone who understands the principles of cryptocurrencies thinks that they will succeed and replace fiat. Would you agree with that? Do you think there are people who truly understand bitcoin, decentralization etc. and say “This has zero to no usability for everyday use”?
@_date: 2018-03-14 17:51:47

Ok, and how is settling trade on the blockchain more efficient or better than how its done today? Is the current global market not more or less open for any participant? How will the blockchain increase trade freedom? This whole sub talks in results without having answers to the how question

No one can deny that, but you also can’t deny that the government is using it to tighten their control over the people.

@_date: 2018-03-14 14:56:25

There is not a single company that has put the blockchain technology into practice on a serious scale. Zero. Kodaks management scammed investors with some buzzwords to offload their own stocks.

The value of gold is mostly because of its scarcity and its history as a method of payment. If it was priced at its application value, it would be far cheaper. And I'm pretty sure the shine just has a psychological attractiveness for humans.
