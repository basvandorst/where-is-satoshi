Good on him.

I would blow you.

You're female right? Because you sure let them treat you like a little bitch.
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:56:39
Decent is anything over $250k/year. Anything else and you're a chump.     
@_date: 2013-11-19 16:45:42
Go fuck yourself, cunt. How about that?
@_date: 2013-04-12 04:51:17
Erlang? You dumb shit.
@_date: 2013-02-09 13:07:42
It can ban Bitcoin within its jurisdiction just fine.

Why is having people dying on the streets wrong? If you have a problem with it donate your *own* money.
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:34:02
down to $55 btc-e.com
@_date: 2013-11-11 07:03:19
shut the fuck up cunt
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:56:48
How much do you stand to lose? Did you sell enough @ $250 to cover what you borrowed? I've heard the coins are going to $20 or less.
@_date: 2013-12-05 14:17:38
What's your address? I'll happily donate a couple of satoshis. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 14:19:22
you should post a link to your daddies
@_date: 2013-04-10 13:54:25
$30k a year? You're one hell of a big shot bro. Bill Gates? Step out of the way.

I run OpenBSD and consider anything less unsecure. 
@_date: 2013-04-02 05:39:17
Someone made a $200k trade?!
@_date: 2013-11-17 05:40:34
Actually yeah it would, according to his math, it would be theoretically productive to brute force if each coin was worth more than $55B. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 03:47:09
A way to figure it out is to save the page locally. If it's client side it should still work.
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:09:48
Fair enough, I'm glad you're OK, I was feeling very sorry for you especially as the price of BTC just hit $80 and is still falling.
You also ordered 3 ASICs from the scam Butterfly Labs. How's that turning out? Did you refund your friends?
@_date: 2013-04-17 00:00:14
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:50:27
No, they're doing it to allow a "market cooldown" in their own words. Faster trading is a side benefit they noted.
BTC-E.com for quotes on the real price of BTC right now. It is plummeting. I know a guy called marv who has a 100k BTC sell order backed up too.
@_date: 2013-04-09 15:05:21
$214.23! New high guis!!
@_date: 2013-04-02 05:20:22
I was around when they were trading a couple cents per coin. Wanted to dump $1k into them since I am a libertarian who sees the value in a currency like this. A trusted friend, however, told me they were a scam and since I had other things to do I believed him.
I could have been ridiculously fucking rich.
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:06:31
UPDATE: BTC trading at 60 AND GOING DOWN.
@_date: 2013-04-08 10:00:44
Haha, sorry, I was the douche. I apologise.
@_date: 2013-04-09 15:04:26
not that funny.
@_date: 2013-04-12 05:58:45
Don't worry about it, they've got their [top engineer]( working on it.
@_date: 2013-11-07 16:55:32
How so? All he did is claim that he had discovered flaws in the paper, but wouldn't reveal them, for some reason. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 09:54:57
i'd kill myself if I was in that position
@_date: 2013-04-12 04:31:55
Facebook is in PHP. It's not PHP.
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:44:46
A guy called marv has a 100k BTC order backed up on gox. expect the price to crash to less than $20
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:31:34
What price did you buy in at though? The prices haven't been "hovering" between 120 and 180, they got up to 180 and are now down to 110 and they're looking to plunge further.
@_date: 2013-11-19 08:24:49
i'll buy in when 1 satoshi is $1
@_date: 2013-11-11 07:07:55
Hey cunt, shut the fuck up.
@_date: 2013-02-09 13:38:04
Whatever you're thinking, it isn't logically. Ignoring the constitutional issues (it's not interpreted properly anymore, and even if it was individual states are definitely within their powers to ban it), the government could just make it illegal to own, trade or facilitate the trade of bitcoins. The enforcement would be via cracking down on the exchanges and trades. It would die relatively quickly.
I think bitcoin is a threat to central banking and thus I won't be surprised when they inevitably ban it. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 06:53:33
you paid for btc at a valuation of $350 each?
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:35:45
your father is an alcoholic who beats you. at least online you can pretend to be someone else, to get away from it all.
@_date: 2013-12-06 02:16:30
Once the world realised a guy was transferring money from a 50BTC account there'd be calamity.
@_date: 2013-11-17 05:15:17
Yeah it would.
@_date: 2013-12-05 12:04:51
LOL Ubuntu, fucking pleb.
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:19:29
Very true. I recognise my wife works harder than me at times.

You can do encryption on Windows just as easily, if not more so, than on Linux, you moron.

Investing is a good thing. "Trading"  is a bad thing.
@_date: 2013-11-07 17:11:51
Yeah, well, he should shut the fuck up until he can prove his claims. He just *made* a pronouncement, with nothing backing it up.  
@_date: 2013-12-06 02:37:01
Good. Sal was being a bit fucked up and saying that he had to make all the videos himself. He's really fucking up himself, that cunt is. He thinks he knows everything, he wouldn't let other people do videos.
I'm glad he's relented now.
@_date: 2013-04-10 12:00:54
Exactly. OP is an idiot, I predict 0 sales.
Edit: No hard feelings OP but you've basically shit talked your mother into only accepting a currency which none (read: 0) of her clients use or can be bothered learning to use. You should apologise to her, since this is probably her livelihood. 
@_date: 2013-04-13 05:50:21
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:57:49
It won't be alright. They've just tanked to $55 and when MtGox opens they will likely go down to about $10 each.
How much cash did you put in? Consider it essentially all gone.
@_date: 2013-12-06 02:30:46
You're not going to get any tips, you fucking liar.
@_date: 2013-11-16 16:00:40
10^80 = ~2^266

Shouldn't you be in the kitchen?
@_date: 2013-11-16 16:04:22
If Bitcoin became the one and only global currency, in a few hundred years each one might be worth $60B +. Only then would the randomly trying addresses scheme work.
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:41:02
Define tiny and significant. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:49:53
If you think $1k is anything less than tiny you're less of a bigshot than you consider yourself.
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:12:52
You mortgaged your home to buy in at $130 each. They're now worth $100 each and falling. How do you feel? They're going down to $10 I reckon.
@_date: 2013-04-10 13:48:25
Wow you're more retarded than I could possibly have imagined. Are you autistic by any chance?
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:43:14
Oh, sorry, thought you were another guy I was chatting with that has lost a bunch of money.
Yeah look MtGox just suspended all trades to try and contain the crash. BTC-E has the price at $100 and falling quickly. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 14:19:59
IT'S HAPPENING
IT'S ACTUALLY FUCKING REALLY HAPPENING GUYS
IT'S ACTUALLY REALLY FUCKING SERIOUSLY HAPPENING RIGHT NOW!!!!
RON PAUL REVOLUTION!
@_date: 2013-04-09 05:24:35
almost, or did?
@_date: 2013-04-08 09:38:11
$30? You're fucking pathetic dude. I was active in the BTC community when you could buy hundreds of them for a few cents. 
I didn't invest for personal reasons though. So I guess you have the last laugh.
@_date: 2013-11-19 08:32:59
.0109 here. $8.50 fuck yeah!
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:35:10
A guy called marv has a 100k BTC sell order backed up. They'll tank below $5.
@_date: 2013-11-17 11:26:53
loot the rich

An image you view on your computer is just 0s and 1s. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 04:02:04
It's been spammed for the past year. This guy's retarded.
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:45:08
Would you define $1k as tiny?
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:20:19
Yeah it'll be around about worthless to mine BTC once you get it but you can make waves on the smaller currencies like PPCoin, Terracoin. Some guy recently came in with 2 ASICs on Terracoin and mined tens of thousands of coins. He had like 10x the entire network power.
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:28:19
you're 14 and angry at the system
