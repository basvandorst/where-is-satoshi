No Positive rights are conditions created by force. Negative rights exist and are DEFENDED with force. 
If there was no state, money tumblers would exist and financial privacy would exist. In this case the feds use force to prevent a negative right.

FINCEN already required Exchanges to have licensing that shit is expensive. Believe me My friends and I are dealing with it right now.
Secondly GOX would have gone under if the restrictions had not been in place and companies were allowed to compete.

Making it the only legal currency of the land does not take away its decentralized characteristic. Centralized meaning a central bank that controls everything about it. BTC doesnt have that. Therefore it is essentially libertarian.
The currency cant stop the government from making it legal or illegal, but it can stay uncentralized and that in and of itself is Austrian and Libertarian.

Helping slaves escape was against the law. Guess those folks should have been in prison.
The Nazis made it legal to round up the jews, gypsies and disabled. Guess because it was legal it wasn't wrong.
Legality is not morality. And this is the very definition of excessive punishment

I talked to Cartel about it the other day. The owner wasn't in. I'd love to be able to buy coffee with BTC. Also the hipsters there would get on board too easily.

They are gold or silver, so you have a physical commodity currency, and then under the sticker is a bitcoin. So basically as long as the sticker is not removed its a bitcoin+ gold or silver. its a neat way of conducting transactions. But mostly they are collectors items.

(oh no no true scottsman coming up) The they aren't anarchists. States are Monopolies on Force. Very few "anarchistic" systems were actually anarchy. Quakers, and the Irish Tuath were really about it. 
If you have a centralized monopoly on force, you are not an anarchy. That means that the only true anarchistic societies are Market driven (Anarcho-cap and Mutualism)

I always say the same. Anarcho Communists are not real anarchists. They use force to make sure the commune shares. The only true anarchists are market anarchists.

Watch the videos. It goes over this. If you don't have a dispute organization you can take your claim against them yourself just like you can represent yourself in courts now. 
Seriously your questions are addressed in that series of videos. I can either spend an hour writing pages. Or you can read Friedman, or you can watch those videos. The last 2 are better for both of us. Time save for one, and 2 you get the information much faster.

The rule of law is private property. If someone aggresses against your private property your Disupute organization would then demand restitution. If he has a disupute organization they will defend him. This will lead the companies going before a pre arranged arbitrator because they will have to do this often.

I guess you don't understand what competing currencies are. It doesn't matter that BTC can be broken down into small units. YOu can technically do that with gold too.  The thing is, is having multiple Crypto currencies is analogous to having Gold silver platinum paladium etc all on the market.

BTC-e is always like 10% lower prices than GOX. Almost always.
@_date: 2013-07-26 18:42:50
Correct. But the IRS can garnish wages, they can empty your accounts. You can't get into my BTC wallet. Taxation would be almost impossible. There is no names associated with wallets and keys. Keeping money anonymous at that point will make it so hard to keep track of who is who and whats what.
Cattle will attack other cattle if it could hurt the status quo. But if everyone is on BTC,taxation would be harming that status quo.

shit happens. I cashed out 200 LTC about 2 weeks ago when BTC was still around 60-70 and LTC was at 66 cents. LTC is now 5 bucks. I missed out on a grand... I think I'm gonna just never cash it out ever again.

Not all correct. But saying that these other whiskies around the globe were scotch style is idiotic.
Scotland is known for its single malts. Blended malts are in this day and age a dead art. Blends used to be fantastic and took great skill. Nowadays most blends have unaged grain liquor in them. 
Most blends suck ass. There are a few small label blends that are nice but anything from JW is going to suck besides maybe the green(no unaged grain liquor in it)

Thats not regulation. Thats them realizing they are hurting the market and voluntarily shutting down till they can resolve it. Thats smart business. This is not like when the Gov't comes in and tells wall street to stop trading for the day and makes them. This would be like every trader on wall street being smart and going. You idiots are panicing. we are shutting down for the day so you can go stop being idiots. 
Its their company so they can shut it down whenever

A group of friends and I all went in on a few BFL doubles(so 2 60gh machines.) We just ordered a third single at 30gh. I know they probably wont be as profitable as the lucky bastards who have them now, but considering we all only payed around 50 or so bucks for the initial coin per person back when coin was super cheap, I think we made a good investment.
