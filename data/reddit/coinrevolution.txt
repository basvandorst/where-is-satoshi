"More people seem to like it so good for you " \[...\]. Nope, is good for Bitcoin and the whole community. Maybe you get confused on what is the sense of Reddit. This is not a challenge. This is a way to be a part of a community, but thanks for your dislike on my comment, this was very useful for Bitcoin community. (sarcastic).

U can t be so stupid, that's why you should be a kid. I think Facebook or instagram is a better place where to be a meme evaluator, or for your personal and useful battle vs memes. Thank You for your precious help, but again, is not needed.

You are so smart, and intelligent to understand that this meme is an old one, yes also a famous one, historic one. KID. Bitcoin is bouncing around his 6K support, testing it, that's why people ask for HOLD, no is not good enough for me, because I m here for a reason different from evaluating the quality of a meme, If u can only see the meme and not the meaning of it, for the historical moment Bitcoin is passing is because you are a kid here only to disrupt and loose your time. You said: "at this point literally spam" NOPE, this is spam: "**Electronic spamming** is the use of electronic messaging systems to send an unsolicited message (**spam**), especially advertising, as well as sending messages repeatedly on the same site. " \[[ Go back to do your homework

 EU parliament releases report on how the European central bank could defeat Bitcoin
The proposed measure is in no way creative and just a copy of China’s actual measures against Bitcoin from a few years ago. A pathetic display when you are considering measures that an autocratic regime imposed on its citizens. The report continues to analyze competition between cryptocurrencies (intercompetition) and wallet, exchanges and other third-party providers (intracompetition). The report is just a theoretical approach as of now. But it could become reality sooner than expected.
