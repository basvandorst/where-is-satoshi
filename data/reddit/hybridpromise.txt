I mean, it works. And considering how difficult it is to even get 75% efficiency with a credit card and effectively impossible if you are under 18 I thought many people could use this.

THIS IS GOOD FOR BITCOIN

lol you people have had nearly a decade for Bitcoin to find its place in society and it hasn't

My first impression of Bitcoin? That thing that I have been using since it was a few dollars for like 1/4th my life? I just cringe so hard when people think that Bitcoin is going to replace fiat, it has it's place that's what it is

Because it has no cap, that seems as though it may be good.

Because first to market always wins in the long term to a superior product

Very low, a significant number of Indians survive on less than a dollar a day. Majority is certainly below $2

Going by this sub you would be the dissenting opinion.

But... That's the whole point, a currency that accrues value isn't a currency bud, that's an investment. You don't just leave USD sitting around doing nothing, you put it to work invest in things, spent it etc... That's good for the economy, considering deflation has been proven countless times to be extremely bad for a country the inflation haters remain.

Having a barrage of links doesn't make your point potent

Doesn't change what I said? And I don't disagree, the INR has insane inflation that won't be changing any time soon.

Tesla is probably the most ridiculed company in regards to its pps that I can think of.

Aren't we more looking down the end of year line than the 10 years from now line?
@_date: 2017-05-31 07:07:33
I'm not your pal, bud... But like I said, a currency is intended to devalue so people don't just sit on their cash stacks, they put them to work. Let me repeat a deflationary currency is not good and will never be favored, be it Bitcoin or the Yen. Attacking USD with something effectively required to function and is basically a benefit is ridiculous.

We should be focusing on Bitcoin making it through the end of the year than looking 10 years down the road.

I mean it will probably crash and steadily recover until it spikes again, that is sort of the Bitcoin life cycle, selling and re buying makes a lot of sense.

10 years not 6 months
@_date: 2017-06-01 04:56:16
Uhm, not really sure what your point is... But yeah the INR does have quite high inflation.
@_date: 2017-06-01 04:57:19
Not particularly nuts if it works!

Don't know the specifics but probably a paper wallet
