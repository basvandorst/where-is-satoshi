Sounds great! Would be great to connect.

Hadn’t seen this yet! Awesome!! Very interested to learn more about their offerings, price, and who holds the keys.

Happy to help! You can set up a Self Directed IRA and use what’s called “checkbook” control.  Essentially what you are doing is creating a self directed IRA account and then investing that IRA money into a LLC which you own. The LLC is owned by your IRA and then you take manager control of the LLC and invest the money how you see fit, in my case purchasing bitcoin. This way I physically have my keys rather than some other company or custodian. All in all it took me a month or two to set everything up for my first time and understand the laws and regulations however I’m very happy I took this approach and have the experience to help others. It also means I’m getting great tax advantages and am incentivized to buy it and forget it as it’s a retirement account. Let me know if you have any other questions!

Exactly!! All with lower fees that a traditional retirement account. Rich Dad Poor Dad made a case against traditional retirement accounts because of the fees but this gets around it.

There are some pretty cheap houses in some rough areas of Detroit you could probably buy ;-)

Already touched on it a bit in another comment; “You can set up a Self Directed IRA and use what’s called “checkbook” control.  Essentially what you are doing is creating a self directed IRA account and then investing that IRA money into a LLC which you own. The LLC is owned by your IRA and then you take manager control of the LLC and invest the money how you see fit, in my case purchasing bitcoin.”
Essentially: open self directed IRA with a custodian who allows checkbook control, make an LLC owned by your IRA, invest in self directed IRA, custodian writes check to your LLC, create business bank account, deposit money, invest money. 
Incredibly incredibly crude haha. If you’re interested in helping out I’d love to open up a dialogue and go a bit deeper and see what we net out on in terms of FAQs for my eventual site.

Awesome! PM sent

Thanks for the links! I definitely looked at a similar post and found not all let me hold the keys and those that did had a lot of overhead cost built into their financial model. It’s so fantastic to see so many players in this space though, Bitcoin is definitely growing!

This is a great example of how things seem easy but in reality aren’t so cut and dry. In fact it’s near impossible to be your own “custodian” if not impossible due to IRS regulations. You can however be in charge of your IRA through self directed IRAs which I’m taking full advantage of. The intricate complexities are what keeps most investors from doing this and I’m happy there are companies out there helping investors out!

I tried to Specifically make this not a sales pitch though... just spreading free info on different options to buy bitcoin. I’m just happy I finally did it and wanted to share my excitement with my fav community.
@_date: 2019-10-01 14:51:54
Agree, it would just be a question of shielding. The only caveat being if your LLC is an IRA LLC. Then there would be tax advantages for the LLC and not you personally.

I have an old 401k that isn’t worth much but is making me like .5% interest, absolutely horrid! I thought a bitcoin IRA would be a good idea. 
Do you think given my scenario a BTC IRA makes sense?
@_date: 2019-09-27 15:06:09
I have a particular scenario that requires me legally to run this through a self directed IRA
@_date: 2019-09-30 05:43:37
I’m in. See you all 3:30PM cst this Friday
@_date: 2019-09-07 18:52:09
Sell it to me. I’ll give you $5 ;)
As others said, if you don’t need the money now, may as well just hold onto it. Could be worth double or triple what it is now in a years time. Ultimately though if you think it’s dumb ditch it. It is safe in coinbase for now
@_date: 2019-09-27 15:08:26
Haha that’s awesome. Yeah I’ve seen tons of services like this online but I don’t want to pay upfront for something I can do. I’ve created LLCs before but there is specific language needed in the operating agreement since it’s an IRA LLC. That is the piece that seems like all these companies are hiding because if they let it out they’ll get cut out as the middle man!
@_date: 2019-09-27 15:03:39
Thanks for the great article. I read one very similar to that and have already contacted a custodian. I am more looking for insight into the operating agreement which I can’t seem to find all that much info but I appreciate the link nonetheless!

Convoluted how? I’ll do some research on GBTC and see what it actually has in it. I’d want to stay away of a fund that has things like Nvidia stock etc.
@_date: 2019-09-27 15:05:38
Agree to the above. I have a particular scenario where I need to run this through an IRA rather than 401k.
@_date: 2019-09-27 15:01:54
Not what I’m looking to do but thank you for the idea
@_date: 2019-09-07 20:01:10
Yay! Hodl!
@_date: 2019-09-07 18:45:55
Sorry to start a little back and forth Mark. I have made up my mind I want to do a BTC IRA so I was simply asking for which ones to use rather than looking for more guidance in “if” I should do this. I felt my post was clear on that but either way apologize for any confusion there.
@_date: 2019-09-07 18:43:28
Well put! Yeah given my situation I’m not seeing why Mark Bear is saying to leave it alone as it isn’t even beating inflation currently. I’ll just park it some bitcoin and forget about it until I’m 60. I’ve done the research as you have, I think it makes sense given my situation.
