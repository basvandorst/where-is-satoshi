I've been very patient and calm so far. However, the way Bitfinex has been handling this situation the last few days is really starting to annoy me. I only have about 50,000.00$ in fiat on BFX and I'm sure there are many individuals who have a ton more on there. I can see that either a haircut and refund by future payments or attracting investors is the way to go in this situation, which I'm sure both are being considering and reviewed by BFX at this very moment. 
However, that DOES NOT justify keeping customers in the dark whom have entrusted Bitfinex with 200M$ of their assets whilst keeping whatever funds remaining hostage.
I'm an educated person who's been around in the crypto world for long enough to understand that socialized losses are the way to go if BFX fails to attract 60M$ worth of investments, but I think we are in place to demand complete transparency, being kept in the loop and multiple announcements per day stating what is being worked on and what progress has been made.

I don't think he was drinking at all, he was taking time out of his busy schedule to talk to a bunch of customers. It was interesting to listen to and I appreciate him taking the time to come in ts. You're a disgrace to the community and just want some attention or to rub salt in the wound.

there's either a mistake with the price it values BFX or BTC at. USD Equivalent wallet is ~18% too low, please look into this before getting the site up.
