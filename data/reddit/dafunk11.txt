The security topic its quite big, i found my peace with cold storage and BIP38. Probably its an average solution, haven't research more about it.

I try to see this as a ticket to the bitcoin experiment more than making money

With the volatility of bitcoin I could understand your opinion. But thankfully I started buying between 200-300 range, so hoping for the best, and price doesnt drop below 200. But who really knows.

Out of the box idea...
With the new UN gathering with the pope at NYC 15/September. There will be a talk to join forces to stop climate change, so the new world government its going to address that issue and a new world currency its going to bring all together. Then cisco and 21 reveal their master plan the 22. And everybody is happy. Until the 23 when CERN discovers dark matter and other dimensions.

The equation has been modified. The assumptions has been challenged. The outcome it's uncertain. The function its stabilizing. Only time will tell what happens. But for now we only can wait patiently.
It's a dynamic system and it's alive, I believe soon it will stabilize, but for the meantime let's enjoy the rollercoaster.

I think we are getting more hedonic adaptation as a whole community.
