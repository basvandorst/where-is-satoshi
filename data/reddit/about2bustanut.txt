I suppose they could have video of me buying at walmart, but i'm not that paranoid. I don't expect it to be worth it to anyone enough to go through the hassle of following the trail from bitinstant to zipzap to walmart to somehow getting a warrant for those videos.

I sold my initial investment and put the rest in cold storage months ago. I'm in it for the long haul now.

What I do is just use a offline android with the bitaddress.org webpage on it, open it up via file://whatever, then take screenshots of my offline phone generated public and private codes. Then can use my actual phone with blockchain to scan the public into a watch only, then scan the private when a transaction is needed.

coinbase just got that $5million investment. I'd be surprised to see them go down.

For me, when I use bitinstant I use bogus names and the people at walmart's moneygram never check.

Now would be a good time for western union or paypal to step up with something.
