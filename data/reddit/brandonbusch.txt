it's the fact that they did it unannounced.  Took the market by surprise and I am sure other insiders at coinbase knew and leaked the info.  I was on bitmain's website trying to buy an antminer and it was almost impossible to get bcash today. bcash went up ~25% when i checked the 24 hour chart at around 7am CST today.  A few hours before they released it on coinbase

Ugh I am sure the $5b company bitmain wouldn’t want their company to crash. I just use common sense. There is a small small chance but they have its own economic system that’s being created. Most of the people here are thinking of absolutely horrible examples.

You basically explained in your second paragraph exactly what I was trying to sugarcoat. Thanks for a detailed explanation of what I was trying to think about :)

I have been working at a financial institution for over 4 years (21-25) and have been investing in bitcoin for the same time period. I am not trying to defend banks because they are most definitely a dying breed but I can answer any random questions you may have. The dude trying to take out 30k cash without calling is actually a hilarious joke by the way. Banks don’t keep that much money in their vault for security concerns. Anyway, AMA
