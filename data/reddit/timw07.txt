This is a great start, not as big as NASCAR - but far more exciting to watch a real sport than guys riding around in circles for 5 hours, right?

I'm having some issues with their non-existent support as well.. Hate that they went from instant 50 to 10 pretty much with no warning, but I made an order for 30 btc yesterday and still haven't received the "instant 10". Email to support is 24 hours old with no response, also pinged the coinbase guy on reddit  "Olaf' with no response.

I have 10 BTC stuck in limbo right now, 2 emails sent to support - no response yet. How can I get in touch with someone that can fix this?

Olaf - is this preventing transactions from showing up in coinbase wallets? Because that's what I'm seeing, I created a ticket with support - I guess I'll have to wait a week to get a response, huh?

This happened 2 days ago, ticket created on Thursday as well

kind of amusing, right?

Oh, and I tried contacting "olaf" no success or response yet

 Tough to keep my jets "cool" - Sounds like they could use some competition... 2 weeks to get in touch with a customer that's been around since day 1 - and that hasn't shown any hint of fraud with them???

Confirmed issue, seeing it on my side as well!

yea - worst part is that I buy / sell over 10k of bitcoin with these guys monthly... They have no concept of customer loyalty
