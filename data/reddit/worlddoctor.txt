I have used them since December and very good exchange. Free trades until Jan 31. You do need to wire transfer but more intuitive than Kraken. No app but used iPhone through safari and works well.

Abuse? Who is abusing who? 
Stolen name,logo, spamming network, coming out with media on futures launch with their CEO Mr Ver trash talking Bitcoin in CNBC, their hash manipulation, pumps in one Korean exchange then coinbase with inability to sell for 24 hour,2x support, centralization attempts, disinformation, etc. 
I have no problem with altcoins like LTC,XMR,Dash,Zcash,etc. Even IOTA they at least try to build something for themselves. But Bcash is just another Chinese knockoff fork altcoin claiming to be the real bitcoin.

Cool I will check again for app.

BTW I am in USA.

No not crazy. I paid around $15.00 on last withdrawal. But if I wanted slower and cheaper the option for $2.50 was available.

Bitflyer is excellent. Great service and no commissions until the end of the month. Biggest exchange in Japan now in the US.

You can get many duplicates before transaction appears as complete. Happened to me many times

When the altcoin market /ICOs bubble money flows to BTC and all the tulip calling friends ask you for advice on purchasing BTC then we will see.

You could also use Kraken in the US. Same day wire once approved. You can request for higher net worth / higher limits. The limits you are looking for. Coinbase will go up to 25000 per week but no more.

Every time you sell for altcoin/fiat it is considered a taxable event. I am not a professional accountant but I have studied the law.

Kraken has mobile support. You can set limit orders / go long/short in I believe around 20 different cryptocurrencies. 
I have been using Kraken since coinbase /Gdax was planning on renaming 2x as Bitcoin. 
Interface is not as “pretty” /user friendly but they have much better security with 2FA for everything. PGP email for extra security as well; based on what I read they are the most secure. 
For deposits you get same day wire transfer but you pay a $5 fee and you have to pay bank wire. My bank reimburses me wire transfer fees. Then you pay 0.026% per trade and it goes down the more you buy. 
If you are impulsive and you want to buy ASAP Kraken is cheaper. 
If you want to wait one week for ACH deposit in Gdax to clear and then be a market maker then Gdax cheaper in fees. If you are impulsive with coinbase you will get a poor market price plus 1.5%. 
So far I have been happy with Kraken. 
Can they improve mobile app and website for “eye candy” and institute ACH deposits- certainly,  but it does work for me right now. 
I will continue supporting companies that recently didn’t try a takeover on Bitcoin.

No. Just once. It’s some sort of bug on their system. Don’t worry.

Everyone and their mother knew $5000 and then correction. I do not trade my BITCOIN=No taxes. Probably down to $3500 if crazy volatility Then ⬆️⬆️. Strong HODL Bullish
@_date: 2017-09-02 21:32:40
Agreed however we cannot predict the future. It's a volatile  asset hence wild swings in price are expected.  I do not short term trade (I don't have the time) I like to HODL on my portfolio holdings including shorts and option trading. When fundamentals change that's when I close the positions. Not by price change which leads to emotional actions. You also end up paying less taxes. My biggest gains have happened  by sitting on my hands. The more I study and understand BITCOIN the more I like it. If it drops significantly I see it as an  opportunity to accumulate more.

Human nature dictates that if it's at 10 cents you wouldn't buy because you think it's going to 1 cent.

Then I would not buy any bitcoin until the dust settles perhaps check back around August 5. Since bitcoin started in 2009 this is the first time in its history where you shouldn't be doing any transactions  : it's a big deal: July 31 until Aug?  The vendor you are trying to pay shouldn't be accepting any transactions anyways. 
@_date: 2017-07-26 22:44:31
It takes 5 days for you to get the bitcoin unless you purchase with a credit card and pay high fees. So your bitcoin will be available around the 31st and then there is a risk moving it to a preferably safe hardware wallet like a trezor or ledger which I asume you don't have. I wouldn't keep my bitcoin in breadwallet on Aug 1st. 
@_date: 2017-07-27 17:20:33
Breadwallet is like a wallet you use for everyday. You wouldn't keep a lot of money there. With Aug 1st it is recommended not to keep bitcoin on those wallets but rather a cold hardware wallet like ledger and trezor. Search for them in YouTube. You have to purchase them.  That's were you should store large amounts of bitcoin. They have been sold out and you will not be able to get one on time even if you overpay for one in amazon. If i were you I would rather keep my bitcoin in coinbase than breadwallet with upcoming fork/software changes. I have my coins in a ledger and trezor. I want to buy more bitcoin but I am going to wait until dust settles. Especially with a delivery on coinbase around Aug 1st.
