That is stupid because all the authorities would have to do is find out wich address is yours and track you back from there and see what you bought and when.

Alot of stuff out there target windows users but really no os is inherently safe but just be smart. only (if you can) use one computer for your wallet and nothing fishy or bitcoin related (people can probably assume you havesome bitcoin if you are on bitcointalk or on this reddit)
Tldr: be smart

Do you know which node is rebroadcasting it 
@_date: 2014-07-07 05:24:32
(my 2¢) if you aren't going to report any of this all ways ask questions in the hypothetical never say you are going to do it cause if you do get caught they can use that against you, but really just report it, the police/DA arent gonna be your worst nightmare the **IRS** is, and they want their money and will tear your life up to get it.

Im running a full node and when I need to restart for blahblah it only takes a few hours for me to get up to normal again

Most likely they are legitimate transactions but miners just dont want to include such small transactions because they generally dont have transaction fees or if they do it is usually small

Bitcoin becomes the currency the US uses for electronic banking and money transfers and it will be the only currency that is FDIC insured, only then will it "get a man on the moon and safely back before the end of this decade" --some dead guy

The Same way that people make money with dollars and euros what your thinking is that there is a whole scheme to make money with bitcoin and bitcoin is no different than the others except the online ease of use

An easy way is to use coinbase and check out their program

I would just try and get somebody who can do it in person because frankly this sounds like the setup for a scam, so please don't ask for people here to trade

The bitcoin network is already a mesh network that's what nodes and miners do they just need some way of connecting the computers together wifi, Ethernet, fiber cables, power line (actual overhead high voltage power lines), or if you are the nsa heat
