"You found your moon".... - sick in my mouth
@_date: 2014-03-01 21:04:24
Yeah you basically lucked out big time
@_date: 2014-01-20 12:16:33
This is still very small for a first round
@_date: 2014-02-24 22:38:57
Serious question - why didn't they just delete the account?
@_date: 2014-01-20 12:15:48
$400,000 is tiny - like a drop in the ocean. You'd need to multiply that by a factor of 100 before it becomes significant.

You really shouldn't buy that much in one go on a bull-run, you should buy in increments, especially if you don't know how Bitcoin works. I'd be very surprised if we didn't see triple digits again (USD), and remember: be fearful when others are greedy.

I meant "you" as in "one", as in, one shouldn't put money in they are not willing to lose... etc. Sorry my bad

@_date: 2017-09-14 21:27:50
well then you shouldn't have put money in in the first place if a) it's more than you're willing to lose, and b) you're willing to sell at a loss
@_date: 2017-09-14 21:26:34
I don't think the value will come back, it *will* come back. China have banned Bitcoin before, literally made it illegal for citizens to put money into it. All that happened is the Chinese continued to invest, and when China lifted the ban the market rallied again. Just search "china ban" in this sub and go back through the old posts, such as this one, and you'll see my point:

My point is that I've still made x3+ in 4 years, simply by holding and not panic selling. And that's after investing at the worst possible time. If I'd invested 6 months prior, it would be 15-20x initial investment by now
@_date: 2017-09-14 21:16:42
I agree that the days of huge gains are long gone, but selling at a loss like many people are right now is crazy.

It's not about companies like Apple "learning" about it - they've known about it for years. it's about companies like Apple coming round to the idea that Bitcoin could be an asset to their business model as opposed to a threat
@_date: 2013-12-08 00:41:07
Yeah, come back when you actually understand international economics, lol

Congratulations for writing a post that is made up of almost 100% clichés
@_date: 2013-12-08 21:13:50
bought pretty much at the peak a few days ago - holding all the way and not concerned at all
@_date: 2013-12-05 12:43:33
You don't understand how markets work do you...
@_date: 2013-12-06 21:32:31
Exactly. Thankfully my wallet has updated and it's there. Something weird was definitely going on - can't see LBC on bitcoinity.org, not sure if it's connected. Hope yours went through too
@_date: 2013-12-07 16:49:53
I invested at ~$1200 - I haven't sold, it will go back up over time (may be a while though!)
@_date: 2013-12-05 15:00:20
you're a moron
@_date: 2013-12-05 19:05:32
it's not a ban!!!!!
@_date: 2013-12-07 16:52:11
same here man... just keep a cool head and don't sell - over time we will see it rise to a new high - not before the end of this year though!
@_date: 2013-12-03 10:37:07
Yes, very briefly! I think people were holding out for lower than that
@_date: 2013-12-06 12:37:55
This has scam written all over it - IF this is legit no one is going to donate until you give more information - which charity? why that charity? how the money will be used? How are you going to guarantee the money reaches them? But I suspect this is just another ill-conceived plan to become Bitcoin rich 
@_date: 2013-12-02 23:54:14
I think with most new things, no one really knows. However, consider the way most people react when anything new comes along - typically there is a high proportion of skepticism with new technology. Consider the internet as a prime example - many people thought it was a fad, and look where it is now. The internet has revolutionised the way we communicate, learn, share, trade etc. Can Bitcoin shake up the currency markets in the same way? Who knows. But it's exciting times, and those who believe in it will be at the top if and when it goes big
@_date: 2013-12-07 17:26:19
No, not for a while. If there's good news from somewhere after the New Year, then maybe - but I'm expecting it to level out at around $600 and become less volatile over the Christmas period
@_date: 2013-12-08 00:16:01
To be fair you lost the argument when you started yelling. If they don't understand it, fine, that's not unreasonable. If everyone understood the beauty of the system straight away bitcoin would be valued at $10k + already. In 5 years time they may even be using it themselves, so don't fret over it
@_date: 2013-12-10 11:54:04
Yeah CNN are shite. The FOX one is actually worth watching!
@_date: 2013-12-05 17:36:19
same here! I wouldn't worry too much, give a couple of days and this will all blow over
@_date: 2013-12-02 00:16:41
have you done a search for wallet.dat? And did you write down the string of words when you set up your wallet on blockchain?
edit - ignore the blockchain bit, didn't read the multibit part
@_date: 2013-12-06 12:47:46
Well then you're taking the other things for granted - start appreciating them more rather than thinking of what could have been, then you will realise what is important. Consider the fact that there are people in this world that have NONE of these things - do you still feel justified complaining about what you don't have? 
@_date: 2013-12-06 12:31:04
Well if it makes you feel any better, lots of people have done the same. You have to look at it objectively - money is a means to an end, that is all. Sure your life may be more comfortable having more money, but it does not necessarily mean you will be happier, in fact in many cases the opposite is true. For some having money is a burden as it comes with responsibility - how to grow it, how to not lose it etc. You have your life, freedom, family and friends, and cheesy as it sounds all the Bitcoin ever mined can not give you that. Remember, there are people in this world much worse off than you.
@_date: 2013-12-07 17:31:52
LMAO, I love posts like this. Probably not the end - what we'll likely see is the markets stabilising over the coming weeks as the huge influx of speculators and those that came here just to make a quick buck fade away. Then it will just be a case of waiting for good/bad news from governments/industry leaders. Could go either way but I'm personally confident in the future of Bitcoin
@_date: 2013-12-08 00:24:26
India!? Muppet
@_date: 2013-12-07 17:52:50
I think the main challenge it's facing is widespread adoption and with the current volatility that isn't going to happen anytime soon. Things have to cool off first

@_date: 2013-12-10 01:29:49
yeah that pretty much sucked - sorry about that :/
@_date: 2013-12-13 18:17:36
Hmmm yes perhaps - I did say only what you can afford to lose, so not all your money. Also Bitcoin has the potential of larger returns than roulette, so the risk vs reward isn't quite the same. 
@_date: 2013-12-08 21:16:11
The number of divisions doesn't have anything to do with the price. The price is linked to demand - if more people put fiat into bitcoin the price will go up
@_date: 2013-12-10 22:32:03
^ this
@_date: 2013-12-06 15:52:20
enlighten me then? You haven't actually bought anything to the argument so sit down
@_date: 2013-12-08 22:13:31
Agreed. There seems to be good support around $700 at the moment, so I can't see sub-$500 unless some more bad news comes out 
@_date: 2013-12-05 16:30:38
What we're seeing at the moment is a series of self-corrections in the market - as the price dips more people buy in to get a good deal. Even with the so called bad news from China today the price has popped back up again due to people in Europe and US taking advantage of the low price. I honestly can't see it crashing significantly unless some really bad news emerges
@_date: 2013-12-06 12:49:58
Oh my god stop posting these fucking things! everyone knows!!! 
@_date: 2013-12-10 22:23:05
Strongly agree with this. Invest and forget (just don't forget your wallet private key!)
@_date: 2013-12-17 18:43:54
not really a scam, it's a novelty item!
@_date: 2013-12-05 13:31:53
Fair enough I guess, speculating on the price certainly isn't for the faint hearted. I bought yesterday at almost the highest point, so today has been a bit of a rollercoaster to say the least! 
@_date: 2013-12-07 19:55:59
Why did you ask then? I am no expert but Chinese citizens CAN fund their bitcoin accounts from their bank accounts. If you're talking about trade exchanges then I'm doubtful, but that wasn't your question in the first place
