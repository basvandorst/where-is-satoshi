It raises awareness. Look at the dates of top posts on this sub and then look at the price change around that same time. It’s silly but it does actually have an impact, if it is seen by a large amount of people.

Alrighty then.

YEAH FUCK ME

Neither. I did not read those rules and I do apologize for breaking them. Just a lil excited. If this post is required to be taken down or further action towards my posting limits here are needed, that’s cool. I’ll leave it to the mods to decide!

Couldn’t tell ya!

If you must sell, there’s a milestone effect in this market. You sold just before so you missed out on a small % increase. In the long run, you missed out on a potentially very large increase...

In summary for why you are receiving all of these negative responses: the price is driven by the demand for it. When you sell or convince others to sell, the demand(price) goes down. 
Congratulations if you were able to make profit!

Nah I’m good. Thanks though!
@_date: 2017-12-16 08:48:39
For sure!
@_date: 2017-12-16 07:07:19
Damn dude! I have no helpful advice to provide you but congrats!
@_date: 2017-12-16 07:34:02
It’s extremely dope! Congratulations on being a part of this :) can’t wait to look back on these milestones and think of how insignificant they really were ;)

Hey that $50 could be 500 this time next year!

Submitting via alien blue does not show said rule when posting. Yes, a responsible poster would make the effort to check the rules before posting regardless. Excitement made me irresponsible, in this case. Once again, sorry.

Uhhh... I addressed that and apologized in another comment, or did you just feel like ignoring that? Chill dude, if it was as big a deal as you think it is, the post would have been removed by now. Feel free to check out my other comment.

Here ya go.

I did not see the rules due to submitting through the alien blue iOS app. Like I said, this post would have been removed by now.
Reporting this post would move towards that, feel free to exercise that right.

I’d probably keep it as positive/clean as possible, to stimulate growth.
Also, negative remarks towards other cryptos wouldn’t really produce much benefit to bitcoin imo, if that’s your goal.
You are free to express yourself in any way you’d like, in the end!

Tf are you talking about lol. I don’t even know what you’re trying to say
