IIRC, it was BTC withdrawals with Mt Gox that started having problems... And signaled that something was wrong. 
@_date: 2014-02-06 07:48:30
I have coins stuck in mtgox
Now, all this with MtGox proves what bitcoin needed. Which is regulation. Like this, we can all kiss our money goodbye. Suing or not, it won't change the fact that we won't get your coins back (or money)...in real world this would be extremely unlikely to happen.
....and if with mt gox goes down it will affect EVERY exchange and ultimateley boitcoin. Because, who will guarantee you and protect you against other exchanges? The ocnfidence will drop significantly which in turn will affect adoption
It was good fun bitcoin, but now the end is near....

You (like people that upvoted you and most here) have no idea about cryptocurencies, currencies and general economic do you??
Check the current supply of dogecoins (FYI: 40,686,524,461 vs 12,338,275 BTC). 
So yeah,  think about doge-coin hitting 20 .FYI: the market cap it will be around 8 trilion dollars, vs  20 billion BTC - the current bitcoin market cap. 
Not to mention there is no limit, so dog-coins are mined constantly...

If mtGox proves that are doing some shady stuff, and/or they go bust...there really is no reliable exchange. Mt.gox was the biggest and earliest exchange.,..with highest volume of trades. If they go down..who will guarantee you that others eventually wont??

Someone explain this to me - how is this not a pyramid scheme??  
They are effectively waiting for new funds in order to pay for the old ones. There could be valid reasons for it, but how the fuck we can now???
@_date: 2014-02-25 13:30:55
Because you are looking at this debacle from the smuggish-handsight angle.
gox was exchange that was doing bitcoing trading among first, for long time had highest  volume of trading, etc. ...and after BitFloor collapse who was there to trust??  Obviously (psychologically) people would flog to the biggest exchange -  as it offers illusion of the safest (aka to big to fail) 
I am from Australia and fro me personally mtGox was only exchange at that time that allowed AU transfers/deposits. Everything went seamless  and I purchased bunch fo coins back when they were $50. I was one of lucky ones that profited with bitcoin when it hit 1200, by sellign half of my bitcoins. Unlike you I was not smart enough, but suspicious enough NOT TO TRUST ANY EXCHANGE (guys there is no regulation here. There si a reason China issued a statement to "trade at your own risk:") So I split rest of my coins among several exchanges and wallets. Didi I lost coins with mtGiox collapse, yes. but just a fraction....and as said I  still way in profit margin
Again , unlike you I an not adding salt to the wound to all unfortunate people who lost (god kwos how many) and who put trust for whatever reason . The fools are only the people who invested their life saving is bitcoin. Something that was constantly advised not to do so. But circlejerk here was too strong that bitcoin will reach Mars. Ironcly, now the circljerk is "hurr durr guys, who didn't see this coming". Granted MtGox was amateurish, but the  whole bitcoin community was/is. Thats why teh safest bet is to trust no one in bticoin world.

@_date: 2014-02-05 07:31:42
Back in November  I had no problems withdrawing BTCs from Mt.Gox, and it was done in few minutes. Now, after hearing news that mtgox has delays, I tried to withdraw small amount...still waiting...
If mt.gox doesn't sort it's shit out this could be end for MtGox and it could possibly hurt bitcoin, because people like me (and you) are doing "bitcoin runs" on mtGox...and it seems that MtGox is holding bitocoins "hostage" (for whatever reason)..if MtGox goes down as some sort of exchange that run out of funds, bitcoin wil go down in history as pyramid scheme

No worries.

Dear Valued Customer,
We apologize for the delay in reply. We merged the tickets for a better follow up. We can see that your withdrawal is yet to be processed. The transactions are being re-issued automatically.All BTC are safe ,the transaction will be processed and they are not lost or stolen.We are working to resolve the issue, but at this point we are unable to give a definite date of resolution.Please be advised that BTC on MtGox are not fractional.
We apologize for the inconvenience this may have caused and Thank you for your patience.
Best regards,

As someone who want to sell couple of bit-coins (that are stacked up on mtgox) how fast do they process trasnactions to BSB account in australia?
@_date: 2013-12-09 00:42:10


That's the only difference. I guarantee you that if everyone starts to cash out, and in process dropping the price,  exchanges will not be able to pay out to everyone and consequently they will bail out, leaving people with useless cash in their "exchange wallet". While ealry adopters and people who sold early are drowning in cash.
Similary, although bitocin doesn't not depend on new buyers, the upward trend in price is driven by new buyers. Less buyers on market, price slowly goes down. One event triggers a people to cashout (like financial crisis did with Madoff) and you have a Pyramid scheme scenario.
There si a reason some people are comparing bitcoin to pyramid scheme. It is not simply as  "lol they are haters, they have no idea. they didnt read Satoshi paper, etc.." arguments coming from college kids


WHAT IS true value of bitocin atm?? (not speculating on future, but atm) I personally would not give it over 50$. It is used in few places, baidu  generated only 1.5 BTC (from 100 people milion market ). So realistically, it is not worth much. The current price is inflated value of what it could be, not what it is
@_date: 2013-04-26 16:51:51
And thats why it many think of it as scam. Almost 90% of bit-coin community (here on redddit)  talks about the value of bit-coin, not the actual use.
One affects the other, without the doubt. Without one there is no other.
@_date: 2013-12-02 10:44:26
That's hardly any argument for bitcoin sustainability. NSDAQ traded much more in volume back in late 90s.

Your warnings and analysis has nothing to do with todays crash. Literally the only people who could warn us about todays crash would be CEOs in Bank of China.
@_date: 2013-04-22 14:36:19
I also asked my self and this is only my assumption so don't take this as de facto truth
Firstly,when they do DDOS they do orders with very small amounts 0.01 if i recall correctly. 
Secondly, to do trading you don't  have to be verified. I am still in a queue fro verification (three weeks on) but I do my trading. I wired my money via  bank account.
Also, you can transfer bitcoins to mtdox BC wallet. Anonymously totally. 
So, hackers create multiple accounts and send bitcoins or do the wire transfer (less likely) the money. Lets say they transfer 10 bit coins per account -  thatss already 1000 transactions!. Assuming that there is large group of people (or bnotnets) doing this (organized) you can easily have 100s of accounts ready to dump 10000s of transactions with little spending overhead.  Add to that that they are most likely investing more than 10BC per acount and you already have 100.000s possible transactions. The reasoning is simple, as you may know, if I sell 10000 BC at  and DDOS the system at same time, most likely there will be a a panic sell and then I'll buy at lower price. It is a win win.
now, mtgox did put some preventive measures. I can't find the article, but they for example limited the amount of small transaction an account can have. Also , in my instance at least, there is a big yellow notice that say - verify your account otherwise you might be banned if suspicious (or similar). So , accounts are maybe banned AFTER the DDOS - we don't know that.
So in other words - they create multiple accounts because  nothing prevents them to create these accounts, but also mtodx has put various system in place to prevent these or/and to handle. Mtgox is stilllearning in that respect and with every DDOS attack they  see the pattern and make sure that it wont happened again. Thats not always the truth as we saw last night , but I doubt that with each attack they use the same method. 
Finally, I doubt we see *much*  more of these attacks. System is learning with each  attack and people are aware of them so affect of these attacks are getting smaller and eventually there will be no point. i hope at least. Its just annoyance  ATM

You posted a link against my concerns with bitcoin, hence I considered it as an [argument](
@_date: 2013-12-05 11:53:24








I agree but again, as said, the nature of the news (bad/good)  would  make the crash or make price go further.
China was a catalyst in this instance for what you have said. It could easily go another way if news favorable.(bitcoin traded at around ~$200-$250 fro weeks before spiking to $1000)
it is afterall still a speculative market. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 12:11:16


Agreed on this 100%. Majority (and I was screaming on this sub  for weeks) jumped on because of exponential growth, and short term gains. Hence creating a perfect bubble  like environment.
I disagree with the news sentiment, if major financial institution said "we endorse bitcoins" it will continue to attract new buyers who would buy in expectation for a rise. I was actually, personally, waiting for India to jump in as new "China" and possible 50% rise.


I would even wage that all these buys that we see at the moment are pumps and dumps from bitcoin owners. There is caution in the air for sure...which again will create selling pressure in coming days.
@_date: 2013-12-05 10:18:21
But anyway, coinjar just reached the daily limit withdrawal (i am suspicious of this as possibly zhuan stopped selling in impeding crash), so you have to wait and link your bank account to withdraw (or vice verca)

and it seems it's running this open source platform
 
I personally never heard of it.  But again I didn't deal much with open source forum platforms since 2005.
Looks pretty average. It had  few security patches in course of months, which is both bad and good thing. Bad -  it may be coded poorly (and judging that minimum server requirements is  PHP 4.1  we can assume some bad code exist there) Good - it is updated regularly. I am weighting that bad part of it is more prevalent and causes the "good" part.

I would like to differ. It makes sense with exchanges. As in *real* world,you really cannot cancel a transaction for a stock
However, when you are buying goods with whatever currency, you still want to make sure you got your goods  before money is of your account or have a safe net because of scam opportunities.

@_date: 2013-04-22 15:29:45
Depends on the amount. But if its larger than 500 (or whatever you feel justified to pay 20$ fee)  wire transfer money to mdgox, I  did that. You do your trading in AU, which sometimes can be a bitch as walls are usually created around USD amounts (but you'll get used to that) . 
My bank charged me 20$ and mtgox charged me 10$. Two business days later and money was in account.
I looked at all other options and the amount of coins I wanted to buy was nor justified to use those services (e.g. localbitcoins is trading at min 127 AUD ATM many with wire transfer only options - so same as mtdox - ,  while mtdox buying ATM price is 120$. Do your math)
EDIT: when do your wire  money transfer you specify your currency (AUD) so you can do trading in AUD as its easier then to BSB your money back to your bank account (without paying the price of exchange rates)
@_date: 2013-12-03 23:03:59
You got it wrong. You took it from perspective of bitcoin supporter, I am taking the perspective of an average Joe and oibviously it was hypothetical example.

@_date: 2013-04-24 18:25:34
Its interesting, whenever I have explain BTC mining to people who know nothing about hashes cryptography or anything, U simply explain it as ..well..mining the gold from one resource.
There is limited amount of gold, but every time you dig you have to go deeper and deeper and deeper. The difficulty increases with every dig. Initially it was easy, but every time more "gold" is digged up the more deeper you had to go for next batch. Sure,  technology and inventions plays the role and can be a game changer (like in real world)  but even so, you still will reach the limit when it will be hard with that equipment; 
So, in order to get rich by mining today you need some serious equipment and investment for that matter.

It is one thing to believe  biotcoin (or crypto-currnecy) is the future. That's fair enough -  I do as well,  and completely another think to dismiss all experts in a filed and all criticism.
As said once before. Why almost everyone pretends they know more about economics , business and legal sytem then the experts? Why don't all these kids apply to the top job in world bank and solve word economy?? Do you know why they don't'??  Because they know jack shit about it.
I am believer in Bitcoin, but surely I am not delusional about it. The other day there was 8th grader talking about bitcoin. We have 8th grader in our 'ranks' that talks about bitcoin and how great it is... and then people wonder why bitcoin is seen as a scam???
Tell me (assuming you are older than 30, and lets say you have business)  how will 8th grader convince you of anything? Yet alone business plan???

When average Chinese person owns bitcoins that will imply that there is a wide usage for bitcoin and  bitocins at that point will be well established as currency. So it really doesn't make any difference if it is Chinese, American, European.
Currently, average person around world has absolutely no idea what bitcoins are. When  average person (moms, dads, aunties and uncles)  start acquiring bitcoins , bitcoin will be considered success. Currently it is still in domain of tech-savvy/industry aware/investors people.
edit: Just like when internet started. Initially it was in domain of tech-savy people and average person (and average businesses) had no interest, knowledge and/or usage of it (example: no point of sending emails when other person you would like to send emails dosen't have internet) . When global adoption started internet boomed. Bitcoin ideally will go down this path or it will disappear as good idea that simply didn't work

From one  of the top comments (8 upvotes , one downovte)


Yeah, so...you see what I am talking about?? How retarded this community is. College kids vs all the exec and brains in big companies. Not to mention techies. So  problem is not in "they don't get it" but it goes much deeper that 90% of people here don;'t understand.

@_date: 2013-12-03 01:07:30


Exactly, but 90% on this forum are rooting for bitcoin not because of its potential, but because how potently it will make them rich. Otherwise they would not talk about prices, invest 5$ dollars, or  post 1000s threads when it drops 20%, etc. Media also talk about bitcoin in relation to investment growth, not use, which in turn attracts not users -  but investors (hoarders).
@_date: 2013-12-09 14:33:36
Not only that. Article itself is shit. 
The only source is this:
“There are about 2,000 active Bitcoin users in India. Most of the users are individuals and want to explore the possibilities of an alternative investment opportunity,” says Nilam Doctor, Ahmedabad-based software professional who has invested in Bitcoins and also developed an online trading platform rbitco.in
One dev, who has a "trading platfrom" (not an exchange btw, just localbitcins.com at lower % ) didnt; even say that India is gaining tractions. Je just stated the number (which is in my opinion to low)
But it is enough to put the title "India is gaining popularity" and people are wetting their pants hoping that China 2.0 will happened and that price wil go to the moooon. 
However, if you mention adoption. People put hand over their ears. Community is behaving like a cult and not like [1] [2] or [3] ironic manner, but full on serious. Soon we will outjerk the circlejerk. fuck.
@_date: 2013-12-03 07:52:17
Oh this thread again "People are stupid and we are smart"


....and for that you need endorsement from experts in a field (Economists, Investors, etc). Not  people in their mid 20s  asking their mom to buy bitcoins.
 To take your Internet comparison. Internet was used widely across universities, military, hobbyist and it was endorsed by people in a field. It had real usage well before it was widely adopted.What limited world wide adoption was affordability and accessibility (no GUI fro exaple)  Bitocin currently is still exclusively based on speculation; hate it you guys or not.
Hate to shit on the mania, but we cannot push something into people if it has little (or no point to) use atm. Not to mention knowledge on "how to use it" and "how to store it" for example recent news where hacker took 90 million worth of bitcoins. As said before, people will say after reading news like that :"Thanks but not thanks. Give me current currency and banks where I can store my money. I am happy to pay the fee for this convenience and ~~piece~~ peace of mind"

@_date: 2013-12-09 03:33:30
yes,  supply and demand play the role, but  if I am willing to pay max of $1000 per bitcoin, no amount of supply or lack of it, will make me buy for more. I can buy it for cheaper, but eventualy somoen else wil come up and say "hey that is worth more.."
That's what determines the price eventually. Not balance between supply and demand, but balance on "how much people collectively are ready to pay for it" Currently people are ready to pay ~$800 per bitcoin,and other are not ready to sell it for less. Simpel as that. Thsi value on other hand is based on what people THINK future holds for bitcoin.

At my workplace I am drilled daily for last week. Bought "handfull" of bitcoins while at work after 250 crash (in retrospect if i dumped all my savings i would be millionaire now, but oh well) . So, when  again BTC was at 250  (where i barley doubled my investment) they told me to sell it. Next time at 800 "you are fool if you don't sell it" So foolishly I thought they were right and I just sold my investment (couple of cons) so I can shut mouth to anyone who thinks I am losing anything. Then again when it hit 900 and today at 1000...can't wait next week "so did you sold them", "why you didn't..". etc...regretting that they know

I'll just point the flaws in your logic
It seems to me you cannot grasp what volatility means.
Sure, cash can lose its value tomorrow by +/-0.1%.  That's hardly an issue.  I can spend $1000 dollars and in month time my purchasing power for those $1000 will still be the same, even though if in process dollar value fell by 1%.
Bitcoin on other hand in a hour can be worth  +/- 300%. **By the time transaction goes through verification process you can lose (or gain) 2-3%**. That's how bit coin is volatile it literally negates the benefits of fee-less transactions. (at this moment, at least. future, who knows...)
Just look at community here. People are buying bit coins with $50 for example, or lets say $500.
Now you tell me this (applying your logic): Why they don't spend those $500 immediately after the purchase of bit-coins??? Why do they hold to it??
I'll quote you, if you don't know the answer


In other words, **this is not what economist are saying, this is what bit-coiners are doing**
Edit: or lets take this further
I have 50 BTC now and I have 50.000 in my bank account,. Convince me why would be better for me now to spent 50 BTC instead of $50.000 form my bank on let say - a car.


We are heading towards bubble and at the end it will burst,  when people realize that majority jumped on bitcoin hype to earn money, not to spend. That is the purpose of a currency - to trade goods. Euro was coined as a currency to do transactions and eliminate fees within Europe Union not for people to hoard it hoping that price will jump "over the moon" and they can became instant millionaires.

So basically it has ~~only one~~ limited use.
You cannot stack up orders. Like ordering two, as that would create two separate payments and hence two orders. You cannot use it in restaurants for same reason when you order full course meal.
You can't promote specials (buy 2 get extra whatever. I mean you can, but thats extra wallet address)
You cannot add extras (i.e. pizza with extra chilli)
etc etc etc...
As said, QR code of the item via app that does that for you and all other additional stuff woudl have more sense. 
Your idea is  basically removing cashier  (as you do the payment directly) who's secondary role is *customer service* when you make an order. Not to mention POS system that they have to either replace and implement, adding additional headache and cost, defeating the purpose of using bitcoins to save money.
Whats wrong with: 1) you make an order, 2) cashier gives you an invoice with total + discounts and whatever 3) you make a payment.??
Easy for everyone and essentially nothing has been changed in ordering process and nothing is different then using cash, credit card or bitcoins -  but payment option. As it is supposed to be.

Australian here.
You don't have to scan anything, take a photo with your phone.
I submitted my  driver license (for address) and my passport (for phot ID) and that was it.
You still can transfer money via wire transfer It takes 2 business days.I did that, bank dosen't care where you send money. You just choose AUD currency so in mtdox wil appear as AUD. Then buy bitcoins
In fact, after getting validated (2+ weeks aftyer) the domestic transfer option is only via  BSB, which also can take up to 2 days with my bank at least. So validation in that reps etc served me no purpose.

I have 50 BTC now and I have 50.000 in my bank account,. Convince me why would be better for me now to spent 50 BTC instead of $50.000 form my bank on let say - a car.

Oh god how retarded you guys think. (and you have five upvotes)
What would be positive thing for paypal?? or Western Union?? Their business model is to charge on transactions. Why would they encourage the system that bypasses them?? I thought the one of benefit of bitcoins is that it doesn't cost anything when you make purchase or a sale?? 
edit: Lets say paypal accepts bitcoins. Ok, you send bitcoins to paypal.  Now what?? Paypal has to put equivalent fiat  in your paypal account. So they exchange it. They charge you a fee (like every exchange does). Plus when you make paypal transaction. Plus  charges  when you want to transfer fiat to your bank account. Congratulations, you went full retard. 
or lets say they don't exchange money, and you have 5BTC in paypal, whats the point of using paypal then if paypal is just the wallet???
Do you guys realize that paypal at that moment will become juts bitcoinwallet/exchange??
Why do yo guys keep thinking that you know better than brains at WU/Paypal/Amazon/ and all other busniess that are not using bitocin. "oh my god how stupid they are fro not using bitcoins". yeah good job kid, please submit us your CV and became new CFO/CEO as we would love to have someone that can help us expand our business.
So yeah, tell me, how would it benefit. So I can sent email to paypal and get a job.
or  maybe they figured it out, maybe they are working on it. What do you guys think??? "just add this piece of HTML code and done!" we accept bitcoins
There are other plethora of legal reasons as well. Jesus fuck, no wonder bitcoin has a Ponzi scheme rep. when users are so gullible and  immature  "omg they are so stupid, they are missing the last train to rich land" - yeah nice argument kiddo.

I noticed it varies, sometimes its above. I realized that they based AUD value on CNY market value (and probably thats how they trade coins internally.) 
to OP, if you have  large amount email  coinjar support


When I asked about options for my coins (which I have in dozens) they basically said to put multiple $5000 orders (it wasn't considered extraordinarily large amount I guess) . I did that and sold 7 BTC at 800 (created 2 sell orders). As said before - money was after 3 business days in my bank account

I understand your point but as soon as gold entered the barter market as a commodity, it became a currency.
@_date: 2013-12-02 12:27:39
Don't get me wrong but I think that you don't understand what confirmation bias is. It is not philosophical argument (or scientific) where 'burden of proof' lies with a person who asserts the claim.
"People display this bias when they gather or remember information selectively, or when they interpret it in a biased way"
We can argue that bitcoin community suffers more from it than Economists do, as bitcoin community interprets data and criticism (bubble trends,  crashes, speculations ) to their favor disregarding any criticism. Economists are maybe very well aware  "how bad keynesian economy is doing", they just don't see bitocin as solution. Hardly a confirmation bias. 
@_date: 2013-12-10 05:41:59
History of bitocin - valid point. It is new.  Gold has been around for centuries as currency. Talks about psychosocial aspects as well of -  "touching and "seeing" money. 
However, he continues that "if it fits the bill" it can be used as gold.  There is talk about regulation and control. He think is valid competitor to fiat.
He just made observation and that  - in his opinion - "he is not **yet** convinced" and "we'll see what will happen" and "maybe the bitocin is not the right and  something similar could come up", etc....
In my eyes he perfectly understands ~~bitcoin~~ economical aspects of virtual currency and possible adoption and he just stated his opinion about it. (edit: as said you won't find politician of his caliber that is ideologically close to bitcoin then him) 
but "old people just don't get it" works better I guess. After-all you have 'invested' in BTCs and all you (not you explicitly)  want to see is  the moon and price at $$$$ while laughing at efforts and theories on how that could actually work and what is the best approach to it (as well as implications).

Do we have any number on how much BTCs were spent on previous Subway that accpeted bitcoins??
If not  it would be good if owner of this Subway reported back after a month.
Don't get me wrong guys, but I don't see  excitement anymore over "we accept bitcoins:" when we never have report on how much: sales they had, how much enquirers they had, etc..This is a reason big players don't implement bitcoins as payment options and think of it as ponzi -  because we have no data to support its usage in real world. I am excluding reports after cyber monday and similar sales promoted here or usage in darkweb. I am talking about real world. Sure "opening event" will create some sales. Tell me how it is after a month, two, three...etc

Why?? Tell us why?? What goes without saying???
Have you done your research and find out  how many bitcoin owners actually play LoL?? Not only that, but how much they are willing to potentially spend??
You think it is overnight implementation ?? Why would they  spend money and resources developing something that literally is in its early infancy? and currently has no business benefits and its has very low return on investment or none (see above)
Legalities &amp; Volatility. 
Kids on this sub. "Why doesn't company X implement bitcion??" Why do they fucking have to,  when they have other options??.
"but...but..but..tranactions...but...but..but..banks" Fuck you.  They are earnign shitloads through traditional method, that current bitcoin adoption (read: how much people are actualy spending) doesn't cover it. 
Show me your numbers how much bitcoin is spent worldwide  and how much potentially could be spend in LoL. Show trends, show projections. Go ask in who is willing  to pay in BTCs to get your numbers. But no, you came here to for some jerking off , hey? Do you realize (because I assume you never been to one) that you have to have very fucking strong case in  the meeting before bosses start even thinking to include it in future  plans. So even if they consider it as of tomorrow, you want see it - nor hear about it - for 6 months. Not only that your begging here makes no difference.
Don't you worry they are not losing any  money. There are smarter guys then you that work for  LoL franchise who would see businesses potentials if it arises **and when it does they will then start thinking about it. They don't depend on bitcoin**;It took paypal aggeeees to becaome  'another' payment option along CC on many w-commerce sites. I worked as developer. I know. "Should we  add payapl?"  Answer: ."nah, no. too much hassle, no one using it - if they don't have cc, fuck them" 
Why would they think differently with Bitcoin?. Not single person I know that has bitcoins has bitcoins only. If they  want to buy something they will buy it with bitcoins or without. If they don;t have any other payment option "fuck em- margin to small, ROI to low" (this is not what I am saying, this is kids how actually business is  thinking)
Why people (primarily kids in this sub) think they are smarter than CEOs, CFOs, Business advisor,...and think that all it needs is 300 upvotes on subreddit for big company to implement something that we don't even know how it will work (as we are speculating on price) while they have an option "to wait it out". They are literally not missing on anything atm.
Fuck me. Literally, this sub is turning into joke. No wonder we are laughing stock over at edit:  spelling.
edit2: The only guy in here who is remontley  considering it says this


Fuck me. "yeah you  should add bitcoins  and not only that - but you  should add extra discount...because??? well  because bitcoins". 
So, this guys is telling to businesses to spend money and resources on something completely new and risky as  no one knows if it will work, and not only that but when they do  - to add extra discount, because there are no other options for bitcoiners to pay??

Not to mention all panic sells in between. However, knowing that this is "only" a "thief cashing in" the price would bounce back.
If someone dumped the amount of daily volume on google stock, even though there are not enough ~~sell~~ buy orders, price will bounce back to its orginal value. But that's  Google, bitcoin on other hand is in speculative stage...so who knows. This thief can drop ultimate troll bomb or he can cash in chunks without affecting the market.

That is totally different. If there was no volatility, then my arguments are irrelevant. Then obviously there is no difference for me using cash or BTCs, in fact I would benefit for transaction less fees with BTCs. But we are still far away from that. Currently trade volume determines stability. One guy dropping 100K will affect the market in instant!


I agree the price is irrelevant in terms of bitcoin usage. However, it pisses me off to no end when people are freaking out when bitcoin drops 20%. Firstly they expect upwards spiral to the Mars, and secondly it shows how they feel about bitcoin. BTC price is totally irrelevant for adoption and usage.

Nothing. That was always an issue with bitcoin [market] Although people tried to rationalise it here how bitcoin wealth has been redistributed but the reality is and was that the wales always had a power to manipulate in low volume market.

majority of people were lured by the quick cash not realizing how speculative market is..and how speculative the value of bitocin was when it reached $1000. We had no adoptions at that time, it was purely based on the idea what bitocin could be (in long run). You would get down voted here if you mentioned the word mania and bubble. College kids were making fun of economist and experts calling them dinosaurs, simply because they said what it is happening now. In long run ti could work. but fro now it is not good investment, nor it is good for businesses **and that is the real value of bitcoin**
Those people are now bailing out. Many will never come back. In long run, however, there is still prospect.
If you put your  money that you could afford to lose  then don't worry and leave it as its. As if you don't have that money. Just forget about it. Come back after 6 months.
@_date: 2013-12-15 23:10:24
You are missing out on few things. Huge drop and cashout can potentially make exchanges to go 'broke' and hence making it look like Ponzi scheme.  Remember that we are not dealing with traditional exchanges where each coin was bought trough the exchange and hence each dollar that went in, secures everyone who goes out. Plus you have no regulation  and hence no protection. Nothing guarantees you that exchanges can close down due to insufficient cash and bail out basically.
So, market crash + psychosocial impact + media attention would leave sour taste to many (primarily adopters) when you mention word 'bitcoin'
I agree though "faithful" would keep on trucking and it's true  they would "eat it out" (I personally would buy few 1000s if it goes bellow 100)  but it will be far cry from bitcoin idea as you need adopters, not owners. Price, I agree is irrelevant.
@_date: 2013-12-15 15:10:07


This is most valid point in article and one of the most concerning facts that ignores and doesn't want to listen.


Well not really. It has nothign to do with sellers, but buyers
22% is around ~3  millions of total bitcoins. Trading **monthly** volume on mt.gox is around 1.5 mil. If someone drops 3 million bitcoins, even if there is no sell order at all, it will crash the market. **You have to have people ready to buy 3 milion bitcoins.**
For comparison, the last ~30% drop traded in tens of Ks.
This, however is most unlikely to happen as these top 20%'s would shoot themselves in foot if they do something like that. Crashing the market =  no way to cash out. Way better strategy is to sell in unnoticeable chunks. Which may as well is happening now (not really, but who knows?), as market is slowly dropping. 
This is also the reason why people are seeing it as a Pozni scheme (edit: as in - top people sell out =&gt; market crashes =&gt; people are left without their investment).
Basically, if one of those people want to screw with bitcoin market , they can do it. Easily.

Don;t get me wrong but "pretty sure" is not "100% certain I asked my bank." Explain to your bank what you want to do, what is the problem and if they have any options.
The other way is to change your currency setting to (EUR) and buy bit-coins AGAIN with GBP  and sell them immediately for different currency (EUR) .
Obviously you'll lose the difference in buy/sell and exchange ratio , but there is your other option

This is excellent observation that needs to be discussed more than the usual circlejerk here "lets make company x accept bitcoin"
Yes, it is true by implementing BPay  they don''t have to deal with bitcoins at all. They would receive cash instantly. 
However, 
It is not free. 
Bank deposits are limited to certain banks.
How many people have ask about it, so that owner actually would have to think how much  he is missing out. Does busniess have any idea how much sales he could have?? Everyone here posts news when some online bsuniess accepts bitcoin. That means jack shit.  Lets see some  news on how much sales they had and was it cost effective over CC/paypal, etc after all the fees and costs 
Furthermore, if you are not developer or not have a team or  don;t know your way around shopping carts CMSs, you would have to pay developer to implement this feature. Is this cost effective atm?? what's ROI??
Even if owner knows about bitcoin, there is still shady image of bitcoin in media and it is better to wait it out.
Source: Worked as developer for  e-commerce platforms and websites. It took ages for clients to start accepting  paypal. Only when they saw a rising trend in USE they would ask for it. Otherwise they don;t want to bother or as you said - they have fear of unknown and it is safer with old methods

wire (international) transfer: my bank $20 flat fee; mtgox ~$10 flat fee. So ~30$ all together. I would transfer whatever amount you think this fee  justifies. If you plan to buy small amount of BTcs, I would suggest localbitcon.com. Their exchnage rate is ~10% higher. So, for example, if you plan buying 10 BTC then its cheaper via wire transfer otherwise localbitcoin or similar.
While to transfer via BSB I think it costs you nothing and it is , as you said, a tid bit secure. First time wire transferring my money i transfered small amount (as i wasn't sure how long it will take and if it will work,, etc) then I added a bit more. In retrospect I regret not transferring all my "planned money", because at that time when I bought first batch of  BTCs it was ~70, and it jump for those couple of a days to 125 (when my other - higher bunch of funding got in) , then 150...I would be  have at least 25% more bitocins.
My suggestion: If you plan to buy bit coins, transfer your money now. You don't have to buy BTC immediately or ever, but its good to have it and buy it when you think the market is at lowest. After a crash bitcoin was at ~50$ i knew it will jump, but just didn't have options to buy them at that time (buy the time I decided, and when the money went in - it went to 75, etc..).
even now, its Friday I have no money in my funds and market is screaming for a "buy". (yes it can go lower, but imho it will recover when all these news about mtdox legal trouble has more details )
edit: as stated thousand times here -  don't spend money you don't plan to lose.

No worries man, as said - relax. Dude, there are people who had 100s of coins and sold them when it hit $10, then they cashed out and spent their money -  thinking it will be the highest. 
I, as said, could have mined coins in 2010. Did I spend my time thinkign hwo much i could have now?? No. Why? What's the point??
As for time, its just like when you break up with girlfriend. You feel bad, you think what you could have done and not  and how it would be great,  but over time it will pass. 
Don't worry and my suggestion don't stress about it, but don't do anything stupid and in vain invest all your savings. If you belive in bitcoin, invest what you can afford to lose. If not fuck it, cut your loses. Belive me, much harder things will wait you further in life and you will wish you had this 'suffering".

@_date: 2013-12-03 16:08:42
fair enough, but these are only assumptions. 
OP said  that said Economist false logic is in  "Why spend bitcoin if it will be worth more tomorrow? Spend cash, it will be worth less in the future""
I am saying that this is not what economist are saying, this is what bitcoiners are doing. You also claim that to the degree. ("to buy something that they previously could not afford, or to purchase a product or experience that was made possible by the bitcoin ecosystem.")
So adoption to take place initially there has to be some incentive to use BTCs,. **currently** (i can't stress this enough)  there are none. What you are doing is speculating. Which is fair enough...
@_date: 2013-12-10 06:07:01


I agree here, but this won't happened - as many are expecting - overnight (be that bitcoin or otherthing). The other week I saw thread about Western Union and Paypal  and  where title said "they are misisng out. Last chance to jump with bitcoins". Really?? A college kid has better understanding then plethora of experts these two companies have??? "why don't wikipedia add bitocin support", "why dosen't t ebay",  "amazon" and similar questions  where arguments are  "they just  don't understand it.". I'll take historical argument and psychological factor any day over "they don't understand it" . Do you guys (not you again) really think that all it takes for bitcoin to succeeds (hell to gain even 1% of traction) is for big companies ti chuck in piece of HTML code (or API interface)  and call it a success??
@_date: 2013-04-12 09:09:11
While I (sort of) agree with you, you are missing the point of the potential bitcoin has, which is what OP stated while paypal in that respect is limited. 
In reality is different. Juts  today I had discussion at work re: bitcons (as there waz buzz around it) and the colleague asked me "so, if i had 10000 bit cons what can i buy and where can I buy things?",  I said "well,  there are couple of places fro certain goods and that's it" 
So he goes, "So i can't buy nothing with them" I  continued  "well technically you can but on handful of places, also t  you can exchange it for real money!", but then we started discussion what if i have 1 mil in bit-cons who will pay me off, etc etc, ect. He concluded with "just sounds so dodgy"
So,  there is no point of pretending that bitconis ATM has no limitations in use,  but also this doesn't doesn't exclude possible potential. Same argument could've been used when banknotes were  introduced as promissory note for gold.
@_date: 2013-12-06 21:12:58
That's no the point. In stock market firms gave their quarterly reports for a reason. Critics or no critics, to much expectation or little, valuable info or invaluable - that's up to market to determine.

@_date: 2013-12-10 11:12:55
Yeah that's fair enough, but I doubt that has to do anything with age, or in this instance, anything what Ron Paul was talking about.
Yeah, Windows 95 helped wide adoption of PCs into households by simplifying the use and in consequence help Internet adoption. But the underlying principles were already set. Internet (or rather tcp/ip) was endorsed by old and young  well before it became wide popular. That is not the case with bitcoin.
But generally I agree, that simplifying \*bugs\* we can make bitcoin more appealing , rather than a virtual boogie-man. However, that only will not solve issues with anonymity, tax evasion, fraud, etc...that to be fair, many (big guys) are concerned.

it is safe. it can stay in coinjar. don;t worry.  my suggestion -  buy when it hits new low.
edit: I mean nothing is safe. if it hits zero. all exchanges will bail out and unable to pay,  and bitcoin will have a status of ponzi scheme. coinjar though is not technically exchange but still it has to have fiat to pay. But it is very unlikley  to reach 0. Afterall and not to make fun of you, you have very little to be concerned even if you lost it
@_date: 2013-12-18 08:20:25


 90% of people here are college kids who thought that they are smarter than all experts and they would get rich by "using" bitcoin. I don't want to waste time and find comments where anyone criticizing bitcoin (be that regulation or adoption or hoarding) was  down-voted to oblivion,  while  "lol. economist. what do they know?? they  are dinosaurs" were upvoted , or calling for global adoption when there was no clear business case for it or it was to early.
I personally am happy that bitcoin is crashing. People who thought that their .5 BTC will make them millionaires were toxic to community anyway....
atm there is no future for bitcoin,. take it as neagtive view or whatever but that is the truth. The real value of bitcoin will be one that reflect its usage not some dream or blind faith and only then we will see true value of bitcoin  (my prediction around 50, as I was saying this for months) that will be not affected by any news or speculation.
@_date: 2013-12-06 04:39:46


99% of new users and people wonder why economists call  it a bubble.
Bitcoin is speculative market. Meaning people are paying for what they THINK it will be worth in future. No one knows how much. $1000, $2000, $10.000, $100, $1, $0?? Market is driven by these assumptions. Some people buy thinking it will be worth more, some people sell thinking it is overvalued. When there is a balance between buyers and sellers price is stable. When there is imbalance price favors whoever "pushes" the price.
Volatility is high, because speculations are high. As said, no one knows. So if there is huge sell order, it pushes the price  down, someone reacts by selling (thinking that bitcoin values is dropping) someone is buying, thinking that it still has a value. When China news happened , people thought that bitcoin has no future and started selling, there were few buyers so the price fell due to huge sell orders,  it bounced back because some people thought it still has value and China news was actually favorable of bitcoin. It is 'stable' (in bitcoin terms) now, but primarily due to low volume (low volume = small numbers of sellers and buyers respectably)

Bubble is not only the curve but intent as well. If majority of people hoard BTCs for sole purpose of cashing in when price rises  it is a bubble regardless of what chart is saying.
There are 12 mil BTCs at the moment; [Daily transaction volume avarages at 500k]( Average trading volume on exchanges is around 100K. Exclude daily traders, exclude satoshi dice users and tell  me where do you see adoption trend??? What adoption figures I have to look at?

@_date: 2013-12-09 03:58:07


Not necessarily. People mined bitcoins. This is not IPO where each ~~dollar~~ bitcoin came through exchange and each ~~dollar~~ bitcoin is traded within exchange.


Cut the influx of new buyers (no deposits from bank - no deposits to exchange) and suddenly you have people trading between themselves. Let's say exchange has 1 mil of dollars in their bank account and lets say in market where you have 100K traders each owning 1BTC valued at $10 and lets say price rises by 1000%   and lets say 10% of them decides to cash out -  that takes all money out of exchange. 90% are left with imaginary numbers.


No it doesn't, but because intrinsic value of bitocin is what people THINK it is worht, then the risk are MUCH higher. I can think that Google is worth at (making up numbers) $100 per stock, because I think in future Google will dominate more,  but for Google to reach bellow its real value is impossible. It has real assets and business that generates revenue. So there is very little speculations on its worth.

Anyone who has little idea about bitcoins would know this. It is no secret. Furthermore blockchain size has been discussed fro ages now over at bitcointalk. This particular video as well

You are missing one point here. Bitocin is a currency, not an investment index fund. Majority of people, today at least,  sell bitcoins for dollars and spend that currency. They are not spending bitcoins. So in other words: they are treating a currency like an investment. That's not how currency works. Currency needs to be used in order to have its value. Otherwise its value is pure fiction  and thats why to many bitcoin smells like a scam.


This makes sense if your car dealer, your travel agent, your utility companies, your local strip joint and prostitutes  accepts bitcoins. Otherwise, you'll just sell it for fiat currency  where  bitcoin is treated as investment and hence will suffer from deflation in that regards.
On top of this(edit):  If paypal tomorrow implements bitcoin, many (90%)  will be interested in a value of bitcoin (and how they will be rich when they sell it fro fiat currency) not the actual use. The day I see posts here where  someone spent 50 bitcoins on the actual goods, then bticoin might have the future we all envisioned. For that we need stability in market and more  bitcoin stores and less "what will be the value of bitcoin in x days"
edit2: just to make sure: I am not saying that OP is not right, I am saying he is right ONLY if we use bitcoins. Argument "people will buy stuff" makes no sense, if they will sell for fiat currency at exchange.
@_date: 2013-12-06 21:56:12
Ok lets compare it with TCP/IP?? and lets go back 40 years ago.
Knowing how many nodes and how they perform and how many we have them connected on this network protocol is essential for future adoption. 
I agree with what you are saying (and I've been promoter of that to) that success of bitcoin is irrelevant of the price. But weather "I" should buy bitcoins or have a store to accept bitcoins (e.g. build my network with TCP/IP) depends largely on the data of current "performance" of TCP/IP.
Look at it as a beta feedback. Critics could gloat over poor 'performance' but if general sentiment among adopters is positive, and improving,  then critics will fade away eventually. Price may crash and that's not the point. Bitcoin could be success at $10. Price is irrelevant. Usage however is not.

Granted there are economist that , as said, are either indifferent or they think it is cool idea, but to be fair there are no experts in a field endorsing it. On other hand we have pure mania from bitcoin community with limited or no knowledge in economics. Argument "they don't know. they are old" is hardly an argument.

This is I think biggest perceived threat to bitcoin. There are people with 10000s of bitcoins and one dump can crash it
But again, similar happened in July when large quantity of coins were in hands of  few people. After the crash, coins got redistributed, price recovered.
However, we are now  at 1000+.  To get into  game and buying just 100 coins requires serious investment, yet alone 1000s coins. Early adopters and top 20 (hell I will say top 50) will be consonant threat for some time to the market and liquidity.

Well if I had 10 BTC and I want to sell them, because I want to buy a car  I place the order for $1000.  That means I am willing to sell to someone else who is willing to pay at this price. however, if there are no buyers at this price (because they think it is worth less)  I am "forced" to sell at whatever offer, called "market price". Imagine now there are only three buyers , and if these buyers  are willing to buy 5, 3, 2 BTCs at $999, $998, and $997 respectably, the price will fall to $997 (I sell to first guy, then second, then third and thats the market value) . Likewise, if I want to buy 10BTCs and I place the order for $1000, and there are no sellers (because they think it is worth more) I have to buy for higher price (because I think it is worth it) .So I ask for 'market order". So, if there are sellers for 5,3,2 BTCs at $1001, $1002, $1003, the price will reach 1003. Thats why volume currently affects bitcoin price.
Edit: what you are saying is what we have now. Few buyers and sellers willing to buy/sell at lower/higher market price or market order. So the market is 'stable'.

Both. Look at e-bay. Although currently sellers are less likely to scam and system is much more safer,   but before it went both ways. You buy something - you receive a brick. You sell something and buyer says he never received your goods, files a complaint. gets his money back
Also, I am not saying how much goods will cost, I am just saying that bitcoin has same issues in that regards  as fiat currency.. OP said he liked bicoint because "You make the action to purchase and it's done."   but when buying goods this is not a benefit and it suffers the same risk as trading goods with fiat currency. 
Example: I am selling 50'' LCD TV; send me money at my wallet: h4jh2i4h2iu4hiu2hh1h3198989

IF it becomes. You guys keep forgetting what speculation means. Adoption trend is ATM negative ironically  because of these speculations. Realistically market price of bitcoin should reflect what its current value (aka how much actual transactions we have excluding satoshi dice and exchanges) not what it could be. This then would have less vilotility as adoption  gradually rises. People expect here for amazon to adopt bitcoins from thin air and price to sky rocket. realistically when amazon adopts bitcoins it should not affect the market that much, as at that point adoption would be wide spread.

Further more, why do people here are buying 500$ worth of bit-coins and not spending them tomorrow uisng BTC but they spend fiat, if not for sole intent to earn money (i.e. hope it will grow 100 fold).
Why there was plethora of "hold" posts when price is falling?? and "to the moon" when it is rising? This has nothing to do with adoption, but sole purpose of earning from bitcoin.

Bitpay is not free.
Offers only deposits to certain banks. (what if Riots banks is not on the list??)
Question is what will bank do in that instance?? Without non-existing regulation - nothing guarantees that they will stop payment at any time. (bitpay offers deposits once a month) Will bank charge extra fee?? which can trickle down to players with extra charge , defeating the purpose of using bitcoins
Development time . It is not just "chunk this piece of code into interface"


Predestined maybe, but at this moment even if I was CEO of Riot, I would not make that decision just in order to satisfy kids here so that price can rise to the moon. I would wait for data, before I make any decision. Price and people trading means shit to me. SHOW ME DATA HOW MUCH PEOPLE ARE SPEDNING IT.
As said - present the business case  with numbers, trends and projections where Implementing  Bitcoin payments is \*critical\* for LoL franchise,  with little risk and some ROI short term, and huge long term returns - and then bosses will listen. 
Don't forget guys, that literally they lose nothing if they wait to see how  bitcoin fad will develop and implement it later vs implementing it now and potentially run into several problems in future.  There is no benefit at all (from business stand point)  for them to implement now  - there are no competitors doing it, LoL players don't depend on bitcoin exclusively like they do with other payment options , implementation cost, etc vs "lets wait and see"
Again, stop being smarter (not you) than board of CEOs, CFOs, CTOs in successful companies. 
edit: I see you edited your entry with image. Well in that instance, it cost them nothing to do it ("fcuk it we have so much, on extra dons't make a differnce". But how do we know they are not thinking about it?? Instead of cricljerking here, the LoL community needs to show that it has BTCs READY TO SPEND and present the case. Each of those payment options you have there are added with analysis and successful pitching   by their business development manager to the board. e.g. this number of people  have no option to pay but with bitcoins, if we add the bitcoin  option we can potently earn $$$ and attract X number of players

If the main reason is that people spent bitcoins because it can lose its value  that will be the end of bitcoin. In that instance - more people buy because bitocin might lose its value  =&gt; less confidence in bitcoin =&gt; eventually bitcoin is worthless. You can see the  equavalent  analogy int the market where people speculate on bitcoin value.  When people are selling their bitcoins and  are cashing out  they belive it is at its peak and may lose it's value. If majority of people does this (no. of sellers exceeds no. buyers) bitocin crashes.
People will spend bitcoins once there is no vilotility and when they stop thinking of bitcoin as investment but actual trading currency and mean of exchnage.
Again kids, stop thinking you know better.

Yes, that's all true, but what I am saying the *motive* is not barley to protect "honest workers of china" they still leave it open for people to trade with it, but to prevent bitcoin to be used as substitute to Yuan. As sadi - is it bad news for adoption in China? Yes it is -  without a doubt. But not necessarily for bitcoin.


They are just saying it is not currency in legal sense.


Basically, Yuan != Bitcoin. Don't use it. Nothing again that undervalues bitcoin.

Bugs? lol. Do you realize that it is not \*bugs\* in bitcoin that are the problem. Which are virtually non-existent.
If  there was one bug in bitcoin - the value of bitcoin would be 0.
Or you are telling me that \*bugs\* in economic theories (you know the ones people got Noble prizes for??) need to be fixed?? By community I assume???
If anything (and I am stretching here wild imagination)  bitcoin is the bug fixer. Old people were not the testing ground for TCP/IP protocol, for example, in order for Internet to gain traction. 
You guys are the ones who have no idea what bitcoin is.
@_date: 2013-12-06 02:56:45
Because if everyone invests in hope of getting rich the bitcoin becomes a bubble and is no longer a currency.
Also... Bitcoin can be a success if it drops at 500 but is used extensively as payment system.  As grandparent comment said. It is a payment system not investment stock. You want to invest? Buy stocks. You want to speculate on bitcoins success and value?. Buy bitcoins
@_date: 2013-12-03 08:58:38
It will be interesting to see the usage of bitcoins. This can be indication of adoption and It would be great if they had that data live. 
@_date: 2013-12-02 12:49:10


Again, don't get me wrong, I am no defending this guy (definitely forum needs to be rebuilt) just being objective . 
But, you guys are pulling out this 6M dollar figure from years/months ago as if he had cashed in now.  It makes no sense, you do calculations as if he hold on  bitcoins and at same time you assume that he cashed in now months ago.

That's the problem with volatile liquid markets. In retrospect I could've been millionaire.
Basically you have to decide will you be a "day trader" where constantly you will have monitor and to speculate whether price reached the peak and sell, and then buy at its lowest or to  invest and hold. There si no strategy, there is only risk, especilay with the volume at the moment. It is too volatile. It can drop tomorrow to 50, but it can go to 250. In retrospect it will always shift
Me personally, after spending sleepless nights and having two minor strokes, I have earn some money and lost some; slightly I am in advantage from initial investment -  but I have decided that I don't have time nor the patience or nerve to do daily trading. (when it starts to interfere with work and daily life, you have a "problem" and I couldnt afford that)
I just said to myslef - this is money I  plan to lose. I don't count on it, I don't even regard I have it (in one respect) . It's out of my daily life and out of my life planning. 
I just put it there and by doing that I gave my faith to the market . So now, I don't sell if there is a 10$ drop or indication of a drop. I don't give a fuck. yes in retrospect every time market shifts I could earn 1000s but fuck it; I have to quit my job  as market is (was at least)  volatile that you can't afford to sleep.
If you however want to do daily trades - there are no rules, but also remember no regrets either and always play with money you can afford to lose.

I will bite the bullet and be devils advocate. My biggest issue with bitcoin  ATM is that it is not widely supported by economists.. 
 We have experts on one end that are either against or neutral (as in we ll see what happens)  and we have non experts and young folk that are calling it revolution.

I am aware of that. 1 bitocin can be in use across the world. but my point is, unless it is used, the deflation argument still stands.
I am not saying that OP is not right, I am saying he is right ONLY if we use bitcoins. Argument "people wil buy stuff" makes no sense, if they will sell for fiat currency at exhange
@_date: 2013-12-05 15:06:36
While I agree that this sub as it becomes popular and attracts new subscribers it has less information and more circljerking.
However, in regards to China that happened couple of hours ago (while you were sleeping) 
**Published at: 2013-12-05 15:39:14 Bejing time** , now it is **23:05 in Bejing**
Which puts it approximately on this thread on front page
(at time of writing this comment is says published 7 hours ago)
I am not aware however that they announced that there will be an announcement. 
So in other words, if anything, this sub was pretty much among first to announce the news
@_date: 2013-12-09 03:10:28
Oh god, people in this thread.
Supply/demand has nothing to do with price. The question is how much is one willing to pay when supply is low, or demand is high?
..and that is called SEPCULATION. This speculation kids is based on what people THINK bitcoin is worth (or rather what bitcoin COULD be worth in future) 
Real value of bitcoin, would be anywhere between 5$ and $50 (my opinion at least: as few places use bitcoins and even fewer exclusivley depend on bitcoin). Current (inflated) price is based on speculation how much it could be worth if succeeds. That drives bitocn price, obviously more people jumping in and willing to pay = more chances fro it to succeed = price goes up. news that potently can harm bnitocin future - price geos downa s no more are people willing to pay 1000 per BTC

**You never had it** Do you understand this. You never did. What you had is a wallet that you lost. You never had a rich life. You are not missing on anything, you are only imagining what you could've missed.
it is nice to dream, it makes us feel good, but it also escape from reality. You live now in this world that you don't have and obviously its stressful for you, because that is not your life.
Be happy man that you are alive young and healthy. That your family and friends are alive. As said - if bitcoin never reached these prices -  you will never remember your wallet. You woudl be concerned about milion sof other things. Yes it is good to have extra money, but fuck it. You lost it, many people did.   I missed it for sure.The guy from UK throw his HD with 9000 bitcoins.

@_date: 2013-04-27 09:58:52
Yes that is correct. People invest in currencies, but the currency they are investing in is USED. Everyone here (or most at least)  treats bitcoin as investment and dream on how one day they'll get rich. That's not the point of bitcoin (hence, as said, to many it smells like scam). Bitcoin needs to be used in order to succeed as a CURRENCY.

Newsflahsh for you. Reddit !=Your post reeks with cult mentality. "guys upvote everything even if it makes no sense as long it's positive" You are probably one who thought "china news was good" and now without any sense of selfawarnes yet alone perception.... you are blaming the fallout to shills and negative news on OP is right. Wake the fuck up. 
You want me to create false sense if security and trust? I wonder why people see as biggest emerging jerk sub. 
@_date: 2013-12-09 15:24:57
No, price is directly proportional to buyers  speculation on what bitocoin could be . Don't mix adoption with people who buy bitcoins as investment.
Ironically, the news about adoption in India is actuality something people speculate on the market and it's ignored!! 
As if the whole sub lives in dream land where evryone buys stuff with bitcoins, but mention one news  that actuality is directly related  to that adoption and usage. You get answer "Nope. dosen't matter price is not affected"
price can go to million and it doesn't mean shit if bitcoins are not used as intended. Likewise it can drop to $10 and considered success if used across the globe. Price is not related to success.

shit its 2:31 am in Australia, i have to sleep and go to work tomorrow. I have a feeling when I wake up the BC will be at 80$. Nothing I can do I know, but to be fair these DDOS-es  are hurting not only *investors* but its hurting the image  of bitcoin overall . No wonder bitcoin is hammered in media and why it is a laughing stock (ha!) by every wallstreet expert. I ain't economist but I doubt there was a case where a value of currency  was  manipulated in way bitcoin value is.
We seriously are in need od some decentralized bitcoin exchange

Illegal?? Source?? 
I lived in Eastern Europe (specifically former Yugoslavia - a communist country) You could have a "foreign savings account" and basically buy whatever currency. In ex-Yug most popular was (west) German Mark and have savings in that value.
On top of that and I clearly remember foreign exchange LED display that impressed me as a kid (back in 80s).
As far as I know (and I think I know a bit more about Easter European countries) foreign currency was never illegal or banned. I mean, that is absurd!! You are denying legitimacy of one country, firstly,   and secondly - do you have any idea how will that make hard for USSR (and easter block) to trade??
Sure you might be suspicious if you suddenly rock up with 10.000  USD or alternativley rock up to buy 10.000 USD but that was about it. Never illegal. Never forbidden as currency.

Jesus fucking man. Relax. What kind of suffering you have?? You are young and healthy, you didn't kill anyone, you haven't sold your house and gambled it. **You didn't do anything wrong.**
Regret is part of our lives as you grow older you will have more regrets (I should have done this or that) some small, some big. Yours is tiny, insignificant. If bitcoin didn't jump you would continue your merry life and not even remember your wallet. Don't beat your self down over something you had no idea it will grow.  I installed bitclinet in 2010 on my new rig. Looked into it, run it, and said nah fuck - it its slowing down my computer. How the fuck I was supposed to know this?? I could've bought Mac stocks back in 2000 before first ipods were released and Macinsotsh started to become famous.But how could I know??
If you start looking into your life with retrospective glasses, you will have a bad time. 
@_date: 2013-12-03 09:18:23
Honest answer? (and I would be hated for this)  What's the point? You trade in bitcoins just so you can sell in fiat. Adds unnecessary step that is also soo vilotile  that is simply easier and financially more secure to use traditional methods. Even if you have to pay the fee.  Not gonna happened until there is strong volatility. Regardless of price. 
This is when I say that for me a big red flag is that bitcoin is not attracting serious players. In both tech and financial sector. As said : everyone (or most people) here wants bitcoin to succeed so they can be filthy rich.  They dream moons and marses. Not so that they can do google checkout with bitcoins but so that they can cash out and be ritch.There is a reason why people are seeing it as Ponzi scheme.
@_date: 2013-04-27 09:39:47


Many people invest besides stock market: realestate, savings, retirement funds, etc . Some don't because, guess why - they don't have the money (not to mention to enter a stock market you need more than 500 dollars, that currently many enter bitocoin market) and they need money to buy goods. I don't know how old you are but, to someone its hard to spare even 20$ a week, yet alone to "gamble" so to speak, on stock market, while they have families to feed.

It is becoming ridiculous how userbase are expert in economics, while ignoring criticism from, you know, real experts in this field. Because, and I kid you not, as  one guy said to me (and had upvotes): "they are not real scientist"
@_date: 2013-12-05 07:50:09


You are missing the point you are still 'baiting' them when you lure them to buy bicoins to earn money. Essentially 'promising' something that no one knows if it will succeeded (**bitcoin is in speculative stage kids!!**) 
Grandparent is right - and I hate to say it as well -  but this is exactly the reason why they see it as Ponzi scheme and why serious players are not into it. You have on one hand stack of economists calling it a bubble,  mania and whatnots and highscolers who are bragging about their riches.

While agree on all your points, you forgot this part. First paragraph google translated


**to protect the legal status of the yuan currency to prevent money laundering risks and maintain financial stability**
No matter how cliche I sound this somewhat gives bitcoin legitimacy as there is definitely concerns over bitcoin growth and potential instability to Yuan currency. So they are taking preventive measures. Bad news for bitcoin adoption in China? Yes. For bitcoin? Not necessarily.

To be fair I am warning people about bit coins when they ask about it. Literary I always say "buy with what you can afford . Don't invest your life savings"

dude...my suggestion. cash out, cut your losses and never do any investment.
@_date: 2013-12-03 23:55:23
and thus you proved my point and rebutted OPs claim, that there is no point of using bitcoin at the moment and  is exclusively used for hoarding and not what actually is supposed to be used, like, spending and buying goods.
Unless I put all my fiat into BTCs there is no incentive for me to use it. 
I understand what you mean with "good money vs bad money" but that's when people already have bitcoins. Why would I avarege Joe, used my 50K in savings ,buy bitcoins and then buy a car with them??  The only insensitive for me (not me per se) to buy bitcoins ATM  is potential for growth. Not use.
