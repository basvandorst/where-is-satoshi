The South Korean former UN Secretary-General should be such a meme at this point.

I'm very proud that I'm one of the many who invested in bitcoin, not only money, but also time and effort so that we can earn the amount of bitcoin we always wanted. I'm very happy in a way that I feel like I'm part of a new revolutionary that will change the financial system in the near future.

I think we are still correcting. Correction doesn't mean a straight line down. But no one wants to hear that. We all support our biases like htl mentioned. Anyways hodl if you are at loss, and nothing wrong with being more patient in the market.

Forget about BTC mooning. I'll be happy if it goes up slow and steady... maybe a 1% or 0.5% gain a day. That would be a lot healthier.

Who cares what bottom Bitcoin hits? It will be back in less than a month. Fiat currencies are the water. Cryptocurrencies are the floating objects. Push one down as deep as you want. It will, with certainty, rush back to the top.
John McAfee tries his best to explain,cool :)

Sounds like they’re planning on launching their own crypto asset and don’t want to deal with competing products based on Mark Zuckerberg’s previous post on the subject:
"There are important counter-trends to this -like encryption and cryptocurrency - that take power from centralized systems and put it back into people’s hands. But they come with the risk of being harder to control. I’m interested to go deeper and study the positive and negative aspects of these technologies, and how best to use them in our services."
