Is Bank Of America now closing Bitcoin accounts or did you just choose this?
@_date: 2015-12-12 22:45:38
What are you talking about, the public can buy it now. It's no longer only for accredited investors. 
@_date: 2015-12-20 01:07:22
What are you talking about? How can I be incorrect? I was asking a question.
@_date: 2015-12-23 01:01:52
Yes, and a lot of work has been put into this. I believe it's been used actually. I would check the search option.
@_date: 2015-12-13 01:29:39
oh I get what you are saying
@_date: 2015-06-12 17:23:24
You can use the blockchain, more specifically the Open Assets Protocol as a way to distributed shares of a movie now that you can get equity in a movie.

You got a link to that Slack?
@_date: 2014-10-22 18:33:06
Yea I agree, I didn't say that. What I said was that the companies knew Applepay was coming for awhile.  Apple has been installing devices in stores for a couple of years.  Bitcoin has only been on the radar of some companies for maybe a year, if that.  I'm not talking about development, I'm talking about people knowing its out there.  These are giant companies who move at a slow pace and make very sure moves.  Bitcoin is still scary to them.
@_date: 2014-06-03 11:34:55
The day of the update the wallets got banned
@_date: 2014-05-03 08:03:31
Yes the other popcorn time source code will always work, what I'm arguing is that if you give the people a fair market price they will pay it over pirating. Using popcorn time source code with the dark wallet source code allows us to show that people will pay a fair market price for content. My hope is that people see this and jump at the frictionless transaction. Instead of paying apple or Amazon or google, they get the content for the fair market price.

That's not really the point, the point is getting stickers on the outside of businesses that take bitcoin. With yelp we have a mainstream brand that people trust listing companies that support bitcoin. I frequent a coffee shop that take a Bitcoin but no sticker, we can piggyback yelps acceptance and get those stickers in the windows of a lot of shops.

How are you sure that apple isn't just going to ban this also?
@_date: 2014-05-03 01:34:32
I'm not saying it would stay at that level,, but that level allows Bitcoin users to participate without caring about lost money showing they support a system like that. It's a proof of concept.
@_date: 2014-07-21 03:41:27
Yea, he doesn't fully "get it," he is older than most of us and he comes from a lineage that believes in asset back currency. I think it's hard for people to understand a system that that is new to them, much like you can't teach an old dog new tricks. I think it was Douglas Adams who said,"any invention after the age the 35 is scary and not part of the norm, any invention before 35 is new and exciting and you can probably get a job in it." I'm paraphrasing but something like that.
@_date: 2014-08-06 23:34:47
The nature of an ETF means they have to actually be holding the Bitcoin. They have a direct supplier for them and it's a giant mine. I can't seem to find the interview I saw with the guy talking about. I'll keep looking.

@_date: 2014-07-30 23:56:10
Yea, this is gonna be the big future of bitcoin, when companies start going public or crowdsourcing in shares of the company.  Think about would have happened with oculus with all those early investors who only got a headset rather than shares, they didn't get any of the 2 billion dollars.  I've been toying with the idea of crowdsourcing my next movie on the blockchain, and giving people shares in the movie so any money I make it would get returned to the investors at a %.
@_date: 2014-05-02 07:40:56
More ideas: We write into the source code that the private keys get automatically e-mailed to the production office, essentially giving them full control of the money.
Does anyone know of an open source wallet? Does Dark Wallet work like that?
@_date: 2014-06-07 00:43:57
Yea, I can't find that.  I have it from a long time ago, but I want the updates to work.
@_date: 2014-05-03 06:44:59
Yes I realize I'm advocating the death of unions and the birth of individuals. When the person is stronger than the union, the unions die. Look at Uber and the taxi unions. 
I would love to see the return of theater companies so creativity flows freely, and not through the corporate bullshit of unions.
@_date: 2014-07-31 00:23:14
No, the 15$ covers all fees.  If you insure your money at their vault their is a maintenance fee.
@_date: 2014-07-11 02:51:42
No, none of the money goes back to the "company" making bitcoin.  It will definitely pump money in so the development will happen.
@_date: 2014-06-03 15:38:42
Do you have any info on wallets getting approved in America?

MOTHER FUCKER! Where is my e-mail
@_date: 2014-05-03 11:52:39
I'm starting to understand why they started to allow editing. If you go back and look at what I said, you could write the code so it configures itself to the lowest common denominator basted on market reading.

Good god!
@_date: 2014-07-24 08:51:31
If you go WAY back, people used to get REALLY angry with Coinbase over not getting the best information from them.  Olaf was literally crucified on the subreddit back in the day.  Another thing that pissed people off was not getting the Bitcoin price they bought at and over night bitcoin shot up 100 points.  This is of course the nature of the beast, but I agree that they haven't done anything "wrong," but hindsight is 20/20 and know most people trust the shit out of Coinbase since they have a great track record.  They have added a lot of good security features for the good ole days.

No what I'm saying is that you authorize the system to charge your dark wallet to watch the video at 1 Satoshi. Now a middle man attack could be a problem, that's why I think open source is the way to go.
@_date: 2014-09-08 20:43:06

Wait so is this Uber or Lyft done on an open source network, and it works off of the blockchain?  How does this work off the blockchain.

Yea, it explains why some people didn't get an email today.
@_date: 2014-05-03 23:13:37
Cause I want the people who are using the system to not be traceable, the money isn't going to the torrent distributors it's going to the content creators. The production companies. Also people know what Dark Wallet is so it helps with getting the idea out.
@_date: 2014-05-24 00:56:17
The idea that libertarians don't want a public ledger is a fallacy in my opinion.  They just want everyone to have the same info that the government wants.

@_date: 2014-06-03 11:33:58
Well, for all the noobs here. Blockchain actually had a new app and the day they were going to release it, Apple banned all the wallets. So here's hoping we finally get that update.

It's more like 3% from a meta point of view. Here's where it gets crazy, 40% of the price of stuff is because of fraud. Most of that fraud is credit fraud, you can't do that fraud with Bitcoin. In the long run you could see a cost drop of 30-40% just by cutting out the bloated banking system with too many holes. Just look at that target credit card breach last winter, all that fraud gets passed down to the customers.

I've always wondered how they do this when the price is jumping week to week.  If his salary is say 2 btc for the week, one week it could be equal to $600 the next it's $1200.  What do they base their pricing against?  Is it still levied by the dollar?

This doesn't make sense though, because the wallets are working perfecting fine on Android. If this was actually a problem about legality, Google or the companies would be getting sued.

Thiel has his hands in a lot of stuff, lets get one thing straight (and this is something Jones will never understand cause he's too old and not a tech guy), Peter or anyone for that matter has no power over Bitcoin.  That is to say, it is impossible for anyone to have power over it, everyone has power over it.  This idea is hard for older people to wrap their pre-internet minds around.  The system works off of consensus, like a true democracy, baby boomers are hopeless to understand this.  
EDIT: I don't know if Bitcoin will be the single currency, but the fiat system of central banking can't be the pinnacle of human invention when it comes to banking.  I think Crypto currencies will run the world in the future, TONS of them.  Bitcoin is a global currency though, which is pretty cool to think about.

Sarcasm or do you have a source?
@_date: 2014-06-25 03:52:18
THIS. I think its a great way to get people into, also it will bring a lot of liquidity to the market which we need desperately need.   The only reason I don't put most of my wealth into Bitcoin is simply because I can't spend it.  I don't see it as an investment, I see it as a new economy that I want to use.  If I can use the old system to use my new system thats fucking fine for me, it will only force merchants to accept it and then they can reap the benefits too.  I'm not worried about the fluctuations that much now, I've been through some of the worse with Gox closing and the government stuff.  The protocol is solid, I'm ready to jump all in, but I need this first.

interesting, I like where your head is on this.  More research is needed.
@_date: 2014-05-07 06:20:27
yea it would hit a plateau and level out after awhile.  Once we get an American Exchange and wall street investors can buy in with out having to deal with holding them, you should see a major swing up.  I know it sounds crazy, but I'm a believer.

Really sucks, cause I'm quite good at getting people to take it.  I wonder if I just keep telling them I will work for free if it helps.

I'm not sure we would have no internet if the dollar collapses.  Honestly, we all have meshnet capabilities now on our phones.  Blockchain LLC has a meshnetwork app in the iOS store called Firechat and it could transfer the transactions through that too a set up node.  Hell, you could turn the traintracks into live transmitter.
@_date: 2014-05-03 22:34:44
Exactly you could even put in a kickstarter option so people could invest in shows with coins through the mastercoin protocol.  This would allow for people to, unlike kickstarter, see a return on their investment since they would almost be stockholders in the content.  This is a little bit farther down the line.  As of now I just really would like to show a proof of concept with it.

@_date: 2014-06-10 07:25:22
Hedge funds essential short markets, so if there is a giant drop they make money.  It's how rich people insure their investments.  This allows these guys to be exposed to bitcoin without taking the risk of actually holding the coin/data/private keys, stuff on that end.  They are just looking to make money, and when you see big fish looking at something it's usually a good sign because they don't fuck around...but can be wrong.
@_date: 2014-07-24 08:45:35

understandable. 
@_date: 2014-06-03 15:49:46
This isn't the holy grail, but it would allow a lot of capital to move into the Bitcoin sphere, because people could theoretically almost use it anywhere (as long as it gets Visa or Mastercard).  I think this is a great step towards adoption, and Xapo has a pretty crazy cold storage solution.  I mean that it's insured cold storage.

Like I said before, it's not about the money, it's about sending a message. This has nothing to do with money it has to do with showing the powers that be what is possible. It's 1 shatoshi cause that is not a problem for Bitcoin users to use cause it essential means nothing, but it does show that we would be receptive to the idea.

That's why you actually implement a wallet on top of the popcorn time system, you automate the whole thing, all the people need to do is put some bitcoins into their wallet.

Essentially what they are doing is giving you a bumper of time so people can't just take your money and run.  One of Coinbases biggest flaws was that if someone got into your account, which has happened to people on this sub (the API hole was a total disaster), the person who has access could just send your coins out and you wouldn't know.  This way you have 2 factor email and a 48 hour window to cancel any pending transactions.  It's kind of like a savings account and checking account from the 1980s where you were actually paid interest, not the 2010's where the bank gives you the finger and tells you to pay for using them even though you don't have a different option. Now you do.
@_date: 2014-05-03 00:23:52
Okay so we write an algorithm that figures out the lowest denomination available. I was also thinking long term you could write an algorithm that controls the price so the more people watching it the higher the price. This would do wonders for viral videos.

The idea was to create a proof of concept, when I say "it's" a proof of concept, what I'm talking about is the finished program.  The paragraph was to see if there was any interest in such an idea, if you read the title that would make more sense. 
yea, they do consolidate torrents of movies, try to flow with the ideas here and not get stuck on semantics.  
There is no one in charge of popcorn time, it would be written into the source code that only the private keys would be sent to the production companies offices.  This would be able to be verified since github works off of consensus. 
The price would change after we put a different pricing algorithm in it, again this would be done with consensus.
If you go back and read a lot of my other comments, I proposed doing it with only test coins, but using a dust amount at first I find me exciting.
 I don't want to wait for the production companies, I work in Hollywood, I want to see the studios crumble, I want to usher in a new business model.  I want to push the future into my vision. 
Writing a couple of paragraphs on Reddit has already done a lot, I found out there is major interest in an idea like this, and have been getting PMs for the last couple of days from people who have been working on this or something like this.

@_date: 2014-05-04 00:43:33
Well I don't want the torrent creators making the addresses, I want that to be automated in the program.  Essentially I'm talking about creating a system that automates the content creators getting paid.  The wallet idea was so people could have an "account" or a wallet in our system that would be untraceable, and all they would be doing is clicking on movies and their account would be deducted without them doing anything and the money would be shifted to the bitcoin address of the content creator.  This has absolutely nothing to do with torrent creators.
@_date: 2014-06-10 07:46:45
Okay, so now it's just get ahead any way possible?

No, popcorn time consolidates all the movies, you just attach the bitcoin address to the movie in popcorn time.  The private keys are sent to the production companies.  AGAIN if you go back and read my stuff, this is a proof of concept, the price would change over time.  This is just to show them what is possible. It's not about the money, its about sending a message.

It's pretty crazy if the card works.  It could take a major chunk out of the remittance business.  True they only accept US and Euro, but there are a lot of businesses that take local currency and turn it into bitcoin outside of Europe and America.  South America has had a full on charge done to it.  Mexico is very open to the idea.  Think about being able to send money to a family member in a different country with no friction, and when on the other side all they do is swipe a card like everyone else.  That's insane, there has never been anything that good.  I'm excited to see what it does for the bitccoinosphere.

@_date: 2014-07-24 08:46:45
this is what Xapo does, they just aren't as well known and been around as long as Coinbase.  They remind me of what it was like when Coinbase first popped on the scene. 
@_date: 2014-10-22 00:48:45
This is true, but it's still a fractured ecosystem. Unlike Apple which owns the software and the hardware. They can implement on a much quicker basis. Also it take people around 3 months to really wrap their heads around what bitcoin and how it works.
@_date: 2014-07-30 19:53:15
Good point, i wonder that too.
@_date: 2014-05-03 07:18:07
The whole idea is to automate so people don't even know, a market value price is totally doable and I think people would pay.
@_date: 2014-05-02 21:44:41
It's not about the money! It's about sending a message! 
All kidding aside it's a proof of concept, you could even just do it with test coins. Using actually Bitcoin brings in some legal issues, but open source makes it kind of null in void. It would be like the Napster of movies, but with cash. It would scare a lot of people in Hollywood, but the smart ones would see the opportunity. Anyone know Sean Parker?
@_date: 2014-08-06 19:14:01
haha what the fuck is going on over at Xapo??  I wouldn't trust them with bitcoin till they get their shit together.
@_date: 2014-03-14 05:33:28

@_date: 2014-05-03 22:45:35
Okay, so I was wrong with the 1 satoshi, that's not the point.  Lowest common denominator based on market readings, is saying that you would only be charged the lowest amount that wouldn't be dropped by the network nodes.  Again, this is only a proof of concept, to show that you could funnel money back through the system.  In the long run I think you should allow for the market to determine how much you pay for a video.  Instead of having a fixed amount, you are charged according to the demand.  i don't think you should be paying the same price for a newly released content when the demand is high, as It's a Wonderful Life which has been out since forever.  
The money would go into bitcoin addresses attached to the content, the content creators (I.E. Production companies) would get the money.  Those private keys would be emailed to the production offices with out us touching any of it so only they would have access.  Again, it would be such a small amount of money it wouldn't really matter.  In the long run I would want people to be able to come to the system upload their content and put in all their own info, but since I don't see the production companies jumping at this we would have to manually put in the e-mail addresses of the companies (which are very easy to find).  
This is really just to open up their eyes to what is coming.  My great vision for this would be production units all over the world that are funded by the people and that allows for the great new and exciting programming for everyone.  Allowing people to freely express themselves outside of the stifling major studios and still be able to live a comfortable life.  The price of good equipment has fallen substantially, it is my opinion we are on the edge of a new revolution in the entertainment industry, and instead of fighting the winds of change I want to harnesses them and show everyone what is possible.

@_date: 2014-07-30 20:23:59
What we have is a liquidity problem. Until we have an exchange that is linked to Wall Street and have a functioning derivative market, we will swing wildly because one "whale" (business or person) can move the market with their cashing out.
I wish Bitpay and Coinbase would offer a plan to keep a percentage of the BTC in the network and not cash the whole thing out to their merchants. It would provide more liquidity and help stabilize the market. Secondly, I wish the merchants would wise up and start a rewards program in their system for people that use Bitcoin. They are making money, return the favor. This actually might work better from Coinbase or Bitpay. They could handle all the rewards stuff in house and it would make their networks more robust. 
I've also noticed that at the end of the month we see a down tick.
@_date: 2014-09-12 10:14:21
I guess, it would be a lot easier to notice with bitcoin, especially coinbase since they are building a payment system.  Customer ease should be TOP on their list.

The keys are created inside of the wallet, you automate it so that the wallet .dat file along with the keys are sent to them, nothing at Popcorn Time would ever see it.  You will be able to verify that in the code.  I don't feel I got a lot of down votes, I think someone was trying to piss me off at one point cause I won an argument. Hate to break it to you, but reddit is a great place to get a conversation started about ideas, if you only want programs head over to Github.

This would be so far down the rabbit hole, it's hard to say right now.  Would it be cool to use bitcoin to invest in a stock on a major exchange, sure, but that is really far down the line.  We still have a liquidity problem and we don't even have an American exchange.

First off, Norway is one of the best run economic countries in the world.  Their monetary policy is amazing.  They don't have a central bank connected to the EU, and put their countries money that they make in selling oil into the market and reinvest in the country along with paying people to live there since they make so much money.  The people have every reason to trust their monetary leaders because they very seldom lead them down a bad road.  The world should take note at what that country does.

Yes it is if there is a pegged amount on a currency.  The idea I presented, is built off of a Bitcoin business model. That means there is a topped amount, because of that you can extract a valid finish, which gives everyone an ability extract their own hypothesis.

I can't see coinbase giving people their keys.  They are making a system that will allow people to trade and sell and shop all within their platform.  In the future if you are paying with coinbase through coinbase, the merchant won't have to wait 10 minutes for a confirmation.  One of the reason they picked up Lee who started Litecoin.

Cause it won't have to do with the torrent that's downloaded, it has to do with the movie.  That would be written into the script of the new source code for popcorn time.  Also for the people using the system they would need a wallet in popcorn time so that they could be deducted the amount to watch the content. The key is to keep everything decentralized, that way you can't be sued. On top of that you can't take a cut of the profits as the creator of the program, that being said, you can still make the program and automate the movie delivery business and cut out all the middlemen. Done and done.
@_date: 2015-01-26 08:22:35
It's always been Coinbase's strategy to become a payment method.  They are a network on top of a network, this way everything that is handled in house can happen automatically and for no cost.

Coinbase is the only merchant with a connection to a licensed bank.  They use the ACH network, which is the network that all banks in the US use to transfer money around.  That's why it takes 3 days for them to get you your Bitcoin.  They have not disclosed which bank this is, but it would be safe to say it's probably a local one in SF.  I've heard that Circle might have that connection now too.  Expresscoin and Xapo both take wire transfers.  I wouldn't be surprised to see another company connecting to a bank soon, but banks have been reluctant to touch the companies.  
@_date: 2016-03-12 19:26:05

They won't be able to just unblock stuff, those deals are set by the movie companies.  I'm an indie film maker and have delt with Netflix, I know their business model back and forth.  If you think they are looking at Bitcoin as a catalyst to some big movie I think you are wrong.  They deal in billions of dollars, its a nice bump but nothing more for them.  I love bitcoin, don't get it twisted.

It's much easier for corps to interface with than bitcoin, simple because of the turing complete language, BUT I have a hunch it's easier to sell corps on Ethereum because you know who wrote the whitepaper, and it doesn't have a super mysterious origin and other things that make bitcoin look "scary."  That being said, all of this is good for bitcoin, because what Microsoft is working on is blockchain-as-a-service, which combines blockchains to work together, including Bitcoin.

The rate of development on Ethereum is mind boggling. Talking to devs about coding for Bitcoin and Coding for Ethereum, all say Ethereum feels like home Bitcoin is really locked down because the nodes don't let you run different scripts. I figure 21 is trying to beat this problem by creating a centralized system that you will be able to code into. Still the rate of movement over there is crazy. They have come really far since Frontier was released.

maybe, all signs point to this as a possibility now.
@_date: 2015-11-11 02:44:28
I don't think that is probable. 
@_date: 2015-11-11 02:44:01
Interesting. Vitalik recently talked about how you can make private contracts. It's one of the main selling points for banks and companies about Ethereum. I think the open source will be in Ethereum's favor, and I'm not sure what 21 is proving is an exact copy of what Ethereum has to offer. Devs I've talked to all say Ethereum will always offer more because it's the base code where as 21 is trying to build a layer. None of these devs of course have an onsite into what 21 is making, but I'm loving the competition between these two ideas. 
Edit: also the fact that it will be using a layer centralized by a corporation really doesn't help it. It means it can be taken control of by the powers that be, and that decentralized aspect is one of the most enticing things about bitcoin and cryptocurrency.  Again this is all hypothesis and I'm not a dev.
@_date: 2015-03-02 19:16:42
I'd prefer not to answer that, sorry

It's cheaper on Coinbase.
@_date: 2015-11-11 04:30:38
Nothin is out yet but I'm watching very closely. If anything rootstock seems like vaporware simply because of Ethereum and buzz. People on the fringe usually like more fringe which is a weakness in game theory. The white paper isn't out but, if they can do what the hype says, awesome! The thing is, from talking to Devs, understanding how a side chain works makes it harder for the at home programmer to really dive into. Again, this is all theory.
@_date: 2015-10-16 22:10:31
What does that have to do with anything?
@_date: 2015-11-01 23:26:33
Yea I was thinking the same thing. It will make it seem like the scheme works pushing it lasting longer. It is an interesting thought experiment.
@_date: 2015-03-02 04:44:26
That's what I've come to understand too.  The OTC markets just aren't as well received as the main exchanges.

@_date: 2015-10-29 03:03:31
Over a million dollars has to be put into bitcoin a day for the price to stay stable. I would argue that wall street is already getting in. People in Wall Street acquire position over a long period of time then announce it. This makes it so they don't pump the price up. 
@_date: 2015-11-05 01:36:47
no but that's when traders can start trading, usually money starts to flow in and our around these times regardless that bitcoin never stops
@_date: 2015-10-30 17:31:54
@_date: 2015-03-03 22:21:39
you won't have to hold for 12 months once it goes live, the accredited investors had to hold for 12 months because of the lockout, it's part of the deal and the reason why Joe Everyone isn't allowed into the party. Once Barry get's more money the BIT can start buying more bitcoin, the more money they get the more they can buy which is turn drives price up.  
@_date: 2015-10-31 19:11:52
What about what storJ is doing?

It will help create a backbone to the currency, add that with the addition of the derivatives market of last week, we have what looks like on paper to all economist around the world a true currency.  It will operate in the same world as them, it will open up the doors of perception for the rest of the people.  We are witnessing the coming age of Bitcoin.  If this all works out, we could end up seeing a stable currency at certain price, the biggest hurdle to Bitcoin working as a global currency is the volatility of it, this could stop that.
@_date: 2015-03-02 19:18:50
You can't actually buy anything yet, I tried to put a limit order in and it said.

I just sent a tweet to the author of the article about a date.

It will be on a more respected exchange.

@_date: 2015-10-16 22:09:27
Okay that's over 20 days away, the pump up usually occurs only a week out. This recent run up doesn't correlate IMO. Anyone out there want to prove me wrong?
@_date: 2015-03-02 04:45:03
That's what I'm thinking too.  There is no date in the article of when that is happening though, which is completely infuriating. 
@_date: 2015-03-02 16:57:27
Anyone can buy it, but you can't add it to a portfolio unless you are an accredited investor...that just changed.
@_date: 2015-03-03 02:16:00
Honestly I can't remember, when I did research on them it was back when the price was in the 100's.
@_date: 2015-03-02 21:33:07
what do you mean?  In 30 days it will go live for everyone else?

So...how does this work.  They get the money and then go and take it to an exchange and buy more?  I'm wondering about the correlation of the prices and how GBTC uses their funds to drive up the price of BTC.
@_date: 2015-11-23 01:40:01
It already went through beta like a year ago.
@_date: 2015-10-16 22:11:48
How so?
@_date: 2015-03-03 02:18:30
you need to use a brokerage firm like Scottrade, Fidelity, e-trade, ect. Not just using a credit card, it's an investment portfolio. 
@_date: 2015-03-02 18:18:04
It's Fidelity

BIT is backed by some really big people, wouldn't call this a penny stock.  They have also applied to be moved to the top tier of the OTC markets as soon as possible.
@_date: 2015-03-03 00:16:36
Not an ETF
@_date: 2015-10-07 12:37:29
They weren't able to do any of it feasibly until the breakthrough that bitcoin brought...blockchain. Bitcoin has first mover ability. Andressen has stated about Maidsafe that if they could go back and remake the Internet it's how they would do it. Looks like they are. 21 will get more attention than Maidsafe and have way bigger backers and their team is crazy talented. My bet is on 21, I still hold Safe coin though. 
@_date: 2015-03-02 04:33:07
Where does it say that you still need to be an accredited investor?
@_date: 2017-07-21 08:30:00
That's crazy

Yea it's quite effective though.

Houston, I'll let you know as soon as we have ignition. 
@_date: 2015-10-17 11:05:53
The simplest way to understand it is that smart contracts are agreed upon conclusions between programs or protocols, while a Turing complete system means you can program on top of it allowing for programs to be created for it on top of the protocol. One idea would be to put Linux powered by Ethereum. From what I understand. 
@_date: 2017-07-21 05:35:35

I know, I'm obviously involved in Bitcoin, I post a lot on this sub.  What I'm curious about are other people's idea on the subject, it has to be in people's minds, at least people who are using BTC in a smart manner not a get rich quick scheme.

Stephen dropped the ball on this, doesn't really understand much of what is fascinated for most of us in Bitcoin, and Peter can't understand anything outside of gold.  Neither of these guys are computer people and they don't understand what the real benefits of them.  For the people in it to get rich these arguments make sense, but if you truly understand what Bitcoin could do as a global financial system, how it will change how we spend our money.

This is a problem if there is not an application that is coming to make it go mainstream.  I feel there are two tiers that need to be created, and we are seeing them be built.  First is large holders, money men, who can anchor the system.  This seems old fashioned but we can't escape the validity that is brings to the system.  This is a very important issue, because it plays to trust, and that drives business.  Lets not forget that bitcoin works because we trust it, with that trust gone it dies. You are seeing this occur in the BIT Trust out of Second Market, and the twins trying to get their EFT started along with very prominent people in Silicon Valley. Second, hardware in the real world needs to be come wildly available for everyone to gain access and let it take off.  We are starting to see this occur with the ATM's and other hardware coming out.  This is also a giant sector that the VC's are looking into.  The thing that ties this all together is security, and we are getting better and finding new ways to control the system of validity better than anyone has before.  
@_date: 2013-12-16 10:19:36
Not surprisingly, the Dutch have always ALWAYS been ahead of the curve when it comes to the economy. Spare me the tulip stuff, most of the economy we have now is based off their principles. Wall St was their creation from back home. Give it up to the forward thinkers. I might be a little biased been Dutch, but fuck ya man!

The volatility will slow down as more people get involved, we will have violent swings from here till there though. That's not the major reason why people would start using it. It's just a reason that would help spread the it in the conscience of the people as a mass. The reasons why people would want to use it are many, but to that is for another post. The fact that it's a currency is just a nice feature, and calling it just that is like calling the internet just email. It's so much bigger than that.

It's much bigger than that. The idea of hashing your intellectual property to it is revolutionary, on top of that, with current systems you are paying 40% more for everything because of security. Bitcoin doesn't need these things, so the inflated prices we have on everything can come down.
@_date: 2013-11-07 10:11:39

This is really an annoying interview, Schiff really can't see it, and maybe its because it's not just about making money.  The true power of Bitcoin isn't in making money, it's much much bigger than that.  Gigantic change could occur with it, on a level the world has never seen before.  It would honestly be a brave new world.  We are in the crowd sourcing beta stages of Bitcoin, where it goes from here is limited only by our imaginations. The effects it could have on society are profound, not just from a monetary point of view either. This interview only deals with money, and it falls short of really understand the value.

agree with Q1 being HUGE, it will slowly tick up till after the new year and then boom.  Gavin has meeting with the CFR in Washington too.  That should really get the people talking.

@_date: 2013-11-27 00:58:41
of course there are but the system regulates itself for the most part, it's open source so it can be fixed, there isn't a central person pulling the levers.

Kevin I'm curious when did you buy back in after you told everyone that you were bumping out around 900 cause you knew the correction was coming?
@_date: 2013-12-18 17:03:23
In theory it should, but America has had the ability to export it's inflation in times like this for the past 30 years cause we are the reserve currency of the world thanks to Nixon and Kissinger making a deal with the Saudis so oil was always traded on the dollar. Recently China's new president in his first week made a deal with Russia for all the oil they could need to be traded in yuan. On top of that china and Russia are not longer stock piling federal reserve notes (dollars) and with is pumping 85 billion a month into the market that could all come rushing back into the market causing hyper inflation which  devalues the dollar. Luck for American the central banks are holding much of this inflation, so our stocks are safe.

That's what I assumed, I think people would pay if they could, especially if they supported the artist. This is predicated on the idea that the economy is good and people have access to capital, both of these ideas are a promise inside of  Bitcoin in my humble opinion.

GOD SPEED!  This could be the application we need to make it go mainstream.  Are you looking for any VC?
@_date: 2013-12-23 23:29:29
The next media event they should do is showing how they saved money on the transaction fees based on people who bought using credit cards, it's these type of things that get other merchants excited.
@_date: 2013-12-24 17:46:53
I agree that the system as of right now is ideal, but I look at it long, and the massive effect it could have. I don't really care about the short and saving that 30% right now. It's interesting to note that since a Bitcoin is deflationary people don't like to spend it, but interestingly merchants will discount (the sweet spot is usually around 30%). I don't really understand how you see us paying more in fees if the price goes up to 1500 though. If I bought a cup of coffee that was 3$ with Bitcoin at 600 and a 3$ coffee when Bitcoin was at 1500$ I'm still paying the same fee.
@_date: 2013-11-21 20:18:36
I'm not talking about a copyright, and many of the things you are talking about I understand fully, I work in the industry. Please remove yourself from your high horse and join the world. Bitcoin wouldn't end crowd funding as an idea it would eliminate the need for kickstarter so you could go straight to the person. Essentially kick starter wouldn't be able to take a big cut, I think they will evolve.

I would bet a lot of the merchants are turning in their bitcoins from Friday, it's simple supply and demand
@_date: 2013-12-20 23:29:44
Well a simple tablet is only 100$, you will make that back in saving from transaction cost really quivk
@_date: 2013-11-07 21:43:58
I think we can all agree that is BS, I did the research did you?  Also most people in the government can do more than one thing at a time, unlike the monkey who is .  YO MONKEY BOY!!!! SHUT UP.

What do you think the numbers are of Bitcoiners in LA?
@_date: 2013-12-07 03:27:11
yea, thats what I was thinking too
@_date: 2013-11-27 01:13:09
I spent much of my youth as a programmer I understand how open source works very well, open source is very much the future of the web and the advantages over the top down infrastructure of say a Microsoft will crush Microsoft as we are already starting to see.  Giant corporations can't keep up with the guy in his garage who programs cause he loves the challenge of it.
@_date: 2013-12-04 19:28:24
@_date: 2013-11-22 18:45:38
I guess, the markets operate by themselves in a lot of ways, you could freeze the crash but stopping it would be impossible.  I'm starting to see Bitcoin as the largest redistribution of wealth the world has ever seen, and in the process it's wiping out the middle men and freeing the world to spend their money in much different ways at fractions of the cost it used to.  Think about how much money the US loses just by printing Pennies that are even able to break down farther so it inflates everything to create a currency that isn't even worth spending.  That is straight up crazy talk, now that we have a system that can be broken up into tiny fragments for NOTHING.  This alone has giant implications on world commerce.

Fair enough
@_date: 2013-12-21 02:35:39
Sea they just want to get a tablet and run it, they don't want to spend any extra money to get it up and running.  Maybe in the long run, having a POS set up with everything and that would include your order in the blockchain would be sick.

This is in the works, glad others are starting to wake up to this idea. All activity in the net could end up making you bitcoin too or charge you. As it stands you can turn in your karma in for bitcoin which is like getting paid to reddit.

They gonna use coinbase?

@_date: 2013-11-03 03:00:05
I just think that will be how it works in the future.  Seeing if it was available. This is the very very abstract thoughts of what bitcoin will become. Curious if anyone was working on it yet.
@_date: 2013-12-06 08:43:56
Well it needs to be linked to the exchange, so it can be up an up to the moment price. The guy who did this in Pennsylvania did an AMA a couple days ago. You are only gonna get Bitcoins at like a sliver of the market value. You should really do this through Bitpay and use Coinbase or people are gonna trust you. 
@_date: 2013-11-07 02:37:40
what was it?
@_date: 2013-12-02 02:14:01
Coinbase is working on this, there was a post earlier today. This is in the works. :)
@_date: 2013-11-21 14:04:37
This has broader implications than that, and something I'm very interested in. I'm an indie film maker and as most would know the media and entertainment companies have taken a big hit from Internet piracy. By hashing our products onto the block chain people will know if they are supporting the artist directly. I really want to start VC into this realm with some devs.

But why would the user be using one of the fake cards, he would always be in control of his, the wallet is contained on the card itself
@_date: 2013-11-07 17:13:49
I do, Facebook makes profit off of their advertising, their advertising is great for small business. I can pinpoint potential customers for a fraction of the cost, it's really helpful.

Yea I don't think they know what they are doing. I went and looked at his history and it's not pretty. From what I can tell they don't even have it hooked up to the exchange for a current price, they just want to charge an amount.

What if you open sourced the security, and then had a team of security experts working on the stuff too. Much like how Linux has companies built on top of it. If you hashed the companies manifesto to the blockchain you could become the first Bitcoin based company.

how would the keys be known?  I don't think you could spoof the cards without knowing all the details of the wallet, that would be hard to do.

Hana, ya that would be nice but I don't see that happening.
@_date: 2013-12-23 23:34:50
Wrong! I've sold many merchants on the ideas of it based on the savings. They live in a symbiotic relationship,it's a chicken and egg type things. There is no overhead for the business to implement the system, it's a win win for them. Any smart business owner can see the advantages of it, just by advertising that they accept Bitcoin informs more people about the system. I don't think you understand business very well. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 21:18:21

It has to do with Saudi Arabia wanting the US to attack Syria to gain more control in the region.  Sadly the US acts in this why to keep our power on the petrodollar, but this is quickly eroding.

@_date: 2013-11-27 04:16:48
How does putting faith in a system that has enslaved you solve anything either, this is a radically new idea with tools that humans have never had before.  That's why I feel we need to enter into a symbiotic relationship with the network. For one though, the machines aren't gonna print off a ton of money and make all the money I have in the bank disappear.  This is why people are starting to see the dollar as a pyramid scheme.  The machines have no interest in helping a certain group of people, it doesn't matter who you are, it will keep it even.  This is all in theory of course, but it's a brave new theory. 
@_date: 2013-12-23 18:05:53
If you are an accredited investor I would recommend investing in the Bitcoin Investment Trust with some of that 100k.  Not all of it, but it doesn't sound like you really understand the ideas,  Just put 10k in a couple of wallets through Coinbase to start, and learn more as you go.  The rest put into the trust, they do all the hard work for you, and if you mess up you wont lose 100k just 10k.
@_date: 2013-11-27 04:18:05

No the point I'm making is that customers would also like it cause it's a deflationary currency which as more people subscribe it builds in power. Unlike the federal reserve note (US dollars) which with that awesome interest rate your return is kick ass sitting in the point right?
@_date: 2013-12-24 00:09:55
I wonder who is behind it, can we track and see if people have sent it money?

Why not use bitpay? It's way more secure. 
@_date: 2013-10-04 22:13:51
That would be great, but what I really need is a code that takes the price of bitcoiin along with the price of what I offer and then show the 10% discount in real time.&gt;

Yea, scoff just doesn't get it and he has a large vested interest in gold so it's a little skewed

which one is more secure?

@_date: 2013-12-01 23:10:08
Well I wouldnt care if the stuff worked. Mine would offer a high level of security cause it would probably cost more, but the mission of BiT would be to help spread Bitcoin.  Another device that operates like this is bound to arise but when money is on the line security doesnt seem a small price to pay.

@_date: 2013-11-22 18:38:19
This is a doomsday scenario, I don't think all of this will come true, and no one can predict what will happen in the next couple of months and anything can change.  Maybe Bitcoin will stop the horrid inflation practices that would occur and it would act as a redistribution of wealth.  With the advent of 3D printing we can create products at a much lower cost point than China and then sell products to them.  I'm just curious what would happen, I don't want to see people starving or having to resort to means that degrading of their "soul" and character.

That's a good point, but the security and lateral integration is something I really love. I'm waiting for android to catch up to that. I think there will be a synergy at some point.
