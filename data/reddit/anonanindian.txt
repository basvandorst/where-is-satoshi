ledger is easier for multisig with the coinkite method. afaik, trezor and ledger don't interop very well for multisig. I bought both but only use Trezor. I love the pin feature -- it is a very good way to generate a red-herring wallet.

Money is favor vouchers -  Printing extra vouchers is simply faking that people owe you favors when in reality they do not. It is up to each of us to participate in the voucher system or not. 
I get paid in INR but I convert it all to gold, silver, and bitcoin. Essentially, I demand to be paid in non forgeable vouchers. 
Consider monopoly the game. How unfair would it be if one player kept pulling monopoly money outta his ass-crack? An economy is just a monopoly game with millions of players... Except we allow the rules to be rigged by the biggest player,  a bully who only became strong because he beat up or jailed others and runs his own ass-crack printing press. 
euro == ass-crack money 
Just say no to ass-crack money!

Hoho you are so wrong.
Gold has had roughly the same price in oil since 1950. Look at the gold oil ratio.
So a lot less gold needed to be shipped than you think, in fact probably the same amount as today...

Redid the calculation. 
Approximately 200,000 metric tons at the high end and 2.5 mil tons for a crazy estimate. 
So 10 kg to 100 kg of gold is a 21-millionth of all the gold ever mined.

I'm a similar fan of Peter. Got all his books, believe he's right about the future,  think his dad's book "why an economy grows" is the best economics primer etc. 
This intrinsic value thing and the physicality preference is understandable, a literal extension of the Regression theorem by someone working off of "received wisdom". 
But what really gets my goat is the video where he says: sure they say there's only 21 million bitcoins but there are actually 2100 trillion units and they can make more if they want. 
Grr Peter how many milligrams in your pamp gold card? How many atoms? 
Subdivisibility is a good thing and the best answer to the recent CHF scarcity problem where CHF got so expensive because of the store-of-value buying that there was literally not enough circulating cash for day-to-day purchases by Swiss people.
I really wonder what Irwin Schiff thinks. In a world of bitcoins traded for services the income tax can be made more easily irrelevant.

50 years? Satoshi said it very clearly: if bitcoin wins, it takes over everything. If it loses, it goes to zero. Another 3 years at most and we'll know which way it went. 
There is no middle ground. The price is the measure of success. 
As a single coin gets stratospherically expensive so smaller miner fees still  compensate well enough... Especially as technology progresses and mining hardware gets cheaper and more efficient,  to the point where anyone can run a miner and most do.

Good analysis except it only applies to  a liquid market. 
In  a thinly traded market where the usual supply is not quite kosher and a major player has bought significant amounts over six months? 
Let's say we speculate that boa or Paribas wants to create a competitor to the Vinkle ETF. Money is cheap at ZIRP and they have inside info that the Swiss want to be the financial capital for bit coin.

So this situation of the need to print is historical. 
First, it had to occur post WW2 because trust between Europeans was destroyed and the common trusted asset, gold, had mostly been shipped off the continent. So the dollar stood in for gold and the Marshall plan shipped them planeloads of dollars.
Next, as the Swiss found out recently, if the world wants to save your currency as a store of value aka hoard it, there is no currency left on the street to buy bread with... This is another case where you need to print more, because people can no longer transact when there are no units of the money good left (they have all been taken out of circulation by hoarders).
Of course even *then* printing is sub optimal. What's really happened is that your currency is more valuable and so now bread should cost cents on the franc (centimes?) This *enriches* Swiss citizens and so it's *not a problem* that the rest of the world wants to hoard Swiss Francs.
But physical currency costs a lot more to create for small coins than for large bills... This is not a problem for bitcoin. In fact this is arguably the second-most important feature of bitcoin... the ability to transact while accomodating deflation (aka appreciation of the money-good).
I remember when bitcointards were tipping whole coins in and that subreddit consequently banned them... Boy maybe now they wish they hadn't :)
Anyhoo ... Printing money is not necessary, money gets more or less valuable according to demand and supply just like any other good. As long as you can continue transacting when money gets dearer there is no problem and lots of benefits... 
The central feature of money is that it should not be counterfeited  ... That is what creates trust and acceptance.
Printing by a central bank is just a form of counterfeiting. The Gulf countries are sick of selling their precious non replaceable assets for green bills printed afresh per shipload of oil. They understand the Americans are counterfeiting value (green bills) in exchange for real value (barrels of oil).
They value gold because like all net savers they want the ability to live well in the future and call on the labor of the world.
The dollar won't last and they know that. They've known it since the 60s. But from the 50s to the 90s the US hegemony ensured that some sort of a future would exist for the world they wanted to live in. That's why they took dollars ... and surreptitiously bought gold with dollars when they could.
@_date: 2014-07-03 14:41:18
Well it's not a coincidence of course ... the Arabs have always priced oil in gold.
It's simple Austrian monetary theory with a dash of FOFOA's special magic.
The Arabs didn't trust the dollar to hold its value. From the Middle to the far East gold is the true store of value... and once it was in the West too... arguably until about 1979.
In the Gulf's specific case, when the oil runs out, they still want the labor and goodwill of the world for the oil they have given in the past. They don't want to go back to milking camels two generations hence. One way to do that is to build a future where cities like Doha and Dubai continue to exist and bring in foreigners to work there. They can build the infrastructure now, trading plentiful dollars from their export earnings to bring Harvard and other prestigious names to their cities. And dollars are plentiful while the oil is there.
But when the oil has run out, and dollars are devalued? Large kingdoms may withstand upto 40% devaluation just due to their copious reserves. But they cannot stand a hyperinflationary collapse. They have gold because they think in the long term.
In fact, the best thing the Gulf could do is to build an actual Singapore with a voice for newly-made citizenry. But that is hard to reconcile with the Sheikh-first approach which has so far worked so well for them in terms of long-term visionary projects.

Taxes are already a major factor in any large investment return or spending decision. Companies will offer services related to bitcoin planning or new companies will spring up that ease that aspect cashing in.
Double spending and the fifty one percent attack is an over blown fear. Three is no transaction where 51% is profitable unless you're buying a bazillion Ferraris and the seller delivered without waiting for 6 confirmations. All 51% allows is double spending.
Of what you listed 3 is a concern, but withdrawing coin is the best protection and new exchanges that support multi sig will come along. Coinbase is the only worry re 3.
ETFs might become the primary coin buying mechanism not exchanges.
Nobody is banning bit coin certainly not the USA.
Nobody needs the entire chain. Like with the Finnish broadcast all we need do is listen for confirmations in a streaming fashion.
7 txn limit is a problem for now, and off chain or OT might be the solution.

Haven't had any stolen yet. 
Was a tradehill customer but they (Jered personally)  made me whole, six months after the closing! 
Was a coin floor (great site) customer, lost 500 USD there, didn't go through the credit union repayment process in time. 
Was a gox customer but moved my coin off six months before the crash. 
Sent 29 coins to pyramining which I now regret but still not sure if it is a scam or just a bad choice (rigged against investors). 
Use coin base and circle, never got into the hype of neo-bee and use warp wallets exclusively now. 
Used to use electrum and old qt-client... Only on local osx and Linux VMs &amp; computers... Recovering coin from those days is a bit of a hassle tbh.

@_date: 2014-12-16 03:18:36
I'm in the same boat as you. I have electrum, Coinbase and circle and an old 2010 wallet that I need to consolidate. 
For multisig create 2 HD wallets backed by mnemonic string seeds. Then download coinkite's offline tool and enter the public keys only to generate a txn...  Ideally the computer you use for this is offline booted from USB stick and rebooted after. 
Then create a login on their site for the 3rd signature, this login has password,
 maybe even 2fa. No identity or documents required, totally anon. 
That's my understanding of multisig, corrections welcome. 
The big advantage is a/ spending is more secure b/ fewer keys and passwords to memorize c/ 2 points of failure required for loss of coin (m points for m of n) so even if your computer is hacked you are okay d/ same HD electrum type mnemonic e/sleep well at night with secure consolidated coins f/ can setup family with additional keys in case I die or become incapacitated. 
Check out hw1 also for low cost USB signing key. Or trezor..  Both can be used with multisig.

I guess when people think 51% they equate it to a democracy and assume that the winner can do anything that they want.
