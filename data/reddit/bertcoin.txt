nothing that we didn't already know about, and showed some of the years they are going to be running in movie theaters and tv.
I left papageorgiou's talk convinced that they know their shit, and more confident in my early investment in their company. Hoping their launch is as exciting as their ideas and tech.

they're gonna be here all day Sunday too, and you can still register I think.
that's a heck of a lot of money for a tee shirt, though - but there's so much other cool stuff going on tomorrow you'll get your money's worth I think (litecoin guy will be here and announce some big litecoin news supposedly, and the regulation discussion panel will be a world class cluster fuck)

bitpay has failed multiple times for me in the last couple months when i used coinbase to pay. they dont play well together and i think it's coinbase's fault since it does the same thing sometimes (takes hours to confirm) when i send from coinbase to a non-coinbase wallet
@_date: 2014-02-11 22:57:14
its not. ive had multiple bitpay checkouts fail after paying with coinbase in the last six months. it's a horrible and longstanding bug in coinbase.

I saw him talk last night at btcMiami. he also said bitcoin would hit ten million dollars in 2014.

I'm the other guy in that 'linux market' and the actual scratching part worked fine for me in Linux Mint 16... until I clicked cash out and it went to the front page and I couldn't cash out after that. I'm not crying over 0.0002 BTC, but if I had paid for the tickets I'd be pissed!
Get rid of flash, it's garbage and it's going to sorely limit its usability on mobile (which, let's be honest, is where your biggest market is really gonna be). Another poster said it could be done more elegantly with HTML/CSS. He's right.
Otherwise, I think you stand to make a bundle off of the site when you get the kinks worked out and make it less ugly, provided hosting it is legal in your state/country.

I'm bullish for bitcoin long term and I'm considering investing in bitcoin companies.
What's NEO &amp; BEE? I have the equivalent of $2 USD invested in them through havelock because I liked the sound of the name and I wanted to do something more exciting with my BTC than buying gift cards and cat beds - should I have bought a soda instead?
How tough is it to get BTC into Indian INR? I sent some BTC to a friend in India as a gift to help him make a technology purchase - he's probably going to have to make that purchase with INR. I pointed him to localbitcoins and buysellbitco.in but frankly buysellbitco.in looks kinda shady. Other options? Any testimonials regarding buysellbitco.in?

prime ministers?
@_date: 2013-12-24 17:48:07
I put the equivalent of 3 USD into neo and bee the other day.

If you bought to get rich quick, remember you don't really realize your losses until you trade back into fiat. Also, shame on you.
If you bought because you see the inherent value in the protocol and feel (like many of us) that BTC is worth much, much more to society than 1000-1200... just hold, or maybe invest in a publicly traded bitcoin business.

It will take 24-48 hours with virwox. I bought lindens with BTC the other night and still haven't received them in-world because 'first transactions' are all flagged and have to be ok'd manually by a hired goon at virwox.
