In 5 years:
I wish I haven't been wasting my time with useless studies in 2017/2018... I could have learnt cryptocurrencies, whdn this revoluton was just starting off...
Damn it!
I could have killed 2birds with 1stone, learn the new economy and earn back what banks have had stolen from the people...

The date is 2030. 
\ is the store of value.
It is used solemnly to settle the biggest wealth transfers around the planet. 
Bitcoin blocks are mined mostly empty. Few transactions are being made daily.
Bitcoin mining have been nationalized by all countries in 2024.
The richest country is China, who practically monopolized bitcoin mining in 2024 (95% of the hashpower is in the hands of China), which is not weird at all because - all newly mined Bitcoins are automatically sent to the NBFs anyway. And Chinese NBF is the biggest.
National central banks have been replaced by National Bitcoin Funds (NBFs), 
NBF main purpose is to provide national currency, which are secondary layer tokens (finite amount of tokens) “backed” by Bitcoin held by the fund. These secondary layer solutions are smart contracts built on Ethereum.
Most of the Bitcoins held by the HODLers before the year 2022 were sold in 2022-24 because not many of them resisted the $1 Million price/value. Most of them were bought by countries, and put into NBFs.
The rest were bought by financial institutions (mostly – private and national retirement funds).
Families of the Bitcoin holders, who resisted the temptation to sell in 2024, seem to be financially set for generations. 
Current price of Bitcoin is evaluated to be equal to 80 Millions of PHD dollars (2019 Pre Hyperinflation Dollar). 
But it is hard to calculate precisely because dollar no longer exist, and the ultimate unit of wealth is Bitcoin itself.
Total Global Wealth is calculated as equal to 17.850.000 Bitcoin.
3 million Bitcoins have been considered inaccessible
There is about 150000 Bitcoins left to be mined.
Gold is still valuable but no one uses it as a store of value, because it is too complicated to verify its purity. On the other hand it is promising in energy generation technologies, and health industry.

Imagine - in 2 years we will see people with android apps that will carry in them sums like 5.000.000.000 (1Billion) dollars, only to be able to buy a pack of cigarettes.
or not
before that happens  will save the world.
1,00000000 BTC might be at $1Trillion by then

to be exact isnt 1 BTC 100.000.000 Satoshis?

If they do it in this market it wont work, because it is ultra bullish (talking about real bitcoin) market. There are hundreds of thousands/ will be millions of people waiting for the price to drop to buy the dip. Who of the holders would not buy more if they dropped to say a $1000???

Dont need to. They didnt have the currency that is easily infinitely divisible  like bitcoin. 
Milton Friedman didnt have the full understanding of money because there was no technical ability to divide currency units on and on.
With Bitcoin we have 2.1 quadrillion unique currency units, that are good to work as money until 0.00000001 is equal to $1, and then it still could probably be divided further. 
This is a long way to go and 1btc would be @ $100.000.000.
Deflationary currency with internal divisibility is your friend. Nothing to fear.

Inflation not only is unnecessary, but it s literally hurtful to the economy, on one hand it s a tax, on the other it makes the work done *and paid) in the past, worth preciouslly nothing in the future.
Bitcoin deflationary character can flip the economic system to the right and just side.

do you personally keep the 25 kgs your self? how do you guard it?
@_date: 2017-11-20 15:18:28
how can anyone fear of deflationary nature of Bitcoin while it is the most important feature of the sound money.
the need for inflation is totally false and constructed only to work for the benefit of current banking/financial system of debt.

so called 'economy growth' is an overrated idea.
'hoarding' is a newspeak for 'saving', totally contrary to natural human attitude.
inflation helps economy grow mainly by creating uncertainty in numbers/statistics, and that allows manipulation and 'proving' growth or whatever gov wants.

People who complain about high fees are socialists pretending to be free market lovers.
Lowers fees "fake transactions" have no Impact on higher fees proritized by miners. This is all working as intended.
It is only when majority of transactors starts to setting fees lower, the fees will go down. 
Taking into consideration the expected  value in the future (most btc holders expect $100 k. - $10 millions price) why would you think $200 fee is too high for processing  1btc transaction?
This is all working as intended.

Contract does not make them rigid, you could totally write a contract with a clause of diminishing wages. Today it would make no sense because fiar currencies are highly inflationary by design.
But if you could set your wage in btc today, would you agree to it being diminished with time (and btc appreciation)?
We have been raised in inflation (debt) based economy so our way of thinking is skewed.
The cost of replacing workers would have to be priced in the wages proposal anyway.
That s how free market works.
@_date: 2017-11-20 17:01:44
That would be a socialist problem.
If there is supply of cheaper workers then there is a downward pressure for wages. 
Any resonable employee will accept lower nominal value wages if they can maintain the purchasing power.
Also, robots.��

What was the average value of a transaction? 
I bet it was at least 10-100 times higher than average Paypal transaction.
Which proves the role of Bitcoin (not the only role though) - as a digital gold, used for wealth transfer and huge buys.
