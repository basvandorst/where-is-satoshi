This looks basically like a clone of bitmillions with much lower jackpots. Is there any advantage over them?

Hmm, good point. I don't know the people involved well enough to say for sure, but from various bitcointalk.org posts they seem like the sort of characters who would get involved in something like this. Always good to be skeptical on the internet though...
Edit: based on all the links purchased, it looks like this guy really does have a grudge against Josh Zerlan / Butterfly Labs

Yeah, exactly, or more like that bitcoingem site. It only works if somebody else buys the gem/pixels from you. Which is basically like a pyramid scheme except without the pyramid shape. But also I guess you get to keep the pixels in this case, so it's maybe still worth something from that perspective.

Well, it's harder to see now because other people bought stuff on top of it since. But when I started watching the site, there was an image linking to Butterfly labs, and an image linking to Seals With Clubs. I assumed they put up their own images, it could have been somebody else pretending to be them.
Then somebody bought a bunch of images like [this]( calling BFL/josh Zerlan scammers. And then someone else bought [images]( on top of the Seals With Clubs post calling them scammers too. After that there were a bunch more images calling Josh Zerlan/BFL scammers.
So that's all I know, I guess I don't know for sure who's involved with who, but it's been funny to watch.
Maybe somebody can do an analysis on all the transactions posted to see where they're really coming from?
