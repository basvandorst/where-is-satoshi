More proof that this is a cult.

Stop spreading FUD.

To everyone downvoting me:
300 million / 11 trillion = 0.000027272 = 0.0027272%
7170 / 14 million = 0.00051214 = 0.051214%

Thefts of bitcoin are good for bitcoin because it puts the coins into the hands of people that are more intelligent than the previous owners.

He needs only about $2500 to grow 1000 fold to be poor in retirement (2.5 million 40 years from now won't be that much, check any inflation calculator).

I don't think you know how to do simple arithmetic dude.

Nothing. This is what always happens when exchanges face no regulation. This used to happen with American stock exchanges for a long time. It still does to an extent, but not as egregiously as it used to in the bucket shop days of the 20s.

Thanks for the gold.

Most certainly the price will drop as the new owners of those bitcoins dump them on exchanges to turn them into actual money (USD, euros, etc).
@_date: 2015-02-15 18:02:25
Those are companies that produce actual goods and services though. You can't compare them to an infinitely reproducible cryptocurrency that is backed by nothing and pumped and dumped regularly by speculators, which also has the added inconvenient fact that it is barely used and after 6 years hasn't made much progress in the way of adoption.

His arithmetic is still bad.
@_date: 2015-02-12 01:03:12
Nope. Fuck em for laughing at us and not getting in early like we told them.
@_date: 2015-02-16 19:29:49
Sounds like you're mad because you lost an argument on the internet.
@_date: 2015-02-16 20:56:18
Because you're asking other people to do work for you. If you want it so bad, go write it yourself and then make a pull request to bitcoin core developers.

You didn't tell us why you think it's going to succeed but you want everyone else to? Tell us in your words why bitcoin should succeed.
@_date: 2015-02-16 20:34:39
No. Not happening.

Absolutely was worse seeing as none of those customers ever saw their money again. A billion dollar bank heist of real money still results in depositors (who are FDIC insured) receiving back their stolen funds.

Sorry for your loss.
