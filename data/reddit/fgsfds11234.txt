i'm one of those people who refuse to get a checkbook and my bank will make them for free for me. but yeah they do take forever to go through, but i feel like the delay is because of how frequently people fall for the check scams

Iirc there's an amount of sale you can do per month or year before they report it
@_date: 2019-07-10 11:42:17
Too bad fb is doing it and that can't go well. But on the topic of gold you can redeem a good bit of it every month before you have to report it to anyone.
@_date: 2019-07-24 18:24:20
how bad is it? i used to use newegg until my state started sending nasty letters to every company forcing them to charge tax on online sales, i wonder if they won't for this...

Can you go to Australia to buy some?
@_date: 2019-07-26 04:31:01
What if you buy something overseas, would i have to report it sold in their currency?
@_date: 2019-07-10 07:36:10
Yeah I want to look into using it to buy stuff in the future but it's kinda weird when companies submit stuff like investment earnings on it. There's almost an argument for a stable value crypto but that sort of doesn't work I think.
@_date: 2019-07-20 12:51:27
The real question is should you accept it for payment? Not doing so might mess with them more
@_date: 2019-07-10 05:45:24
I'm feeling weird about btc now, on one hand you can invest long term but isn't it supposed to be used like a currency to buy stuff?
@_date: 2019-07-16 18:07:38
there has only been ~~70~~ 90 days that buying bitcoin hasn't been profitable

My cu went through just fine with me sing coinbase. Some might not be so bad.
@_date: 2019-07-10 11:28:31
Yeah. The other alt coins which are more stable faster and cheaper begin to work better for currency but those simply follow the value of btc it seems.
@_date: 2019-07-14 16:55:28
how so?
@_date: 2019-07-10 09:13:27

Yeah those are interesting but those two channels are pretty dedicated to just lockpicking and showing how badly made modern locks and safes are. Recently they did a joint venture involving locks at a gun range. But might be a consideration if you want to store some coins offline somehow.
@_date: 2019-07-08 01:56:24
Back in my day gas was 11 cents a gallon
@_date: 2019-07-17 18:23:00
sure looked like it was tanking on that chart they were showing, which is funny because right after it looks like it went right back up (9800 ish now) i wonder if the news segment helped the price go up...
@_date: 2019-07-16 23:20:34
not denying that, just poking fun at that one post saying how there was only a small window where buying btc was not profitable, wanted to add the last 20 or so days to that list (for now)
@_date: 2019-07-11 04:39:17
If you are interested in locks check out the youtube channel of bosnianbill and lockpicking lawyer, one of them is working on a modern similar lock.

I'm sure if I invested every spare penny I had in crypto (and cashed out during peaks and paid the taxes of course) over the next 10 years of big peaks and whatnot, I'm sure I could afford to start powering my block somehow.

@_date: 2019-07-29 00:22:24
This is true. Even if you have a credit card with 2-3% cash back on groceries it is still costing more than going to winco which only takes debit or cash
@_date: 2019-07-10 02:42:13
I was assuming it was so they -had- to keep your tax info. Sounds like something they would do
@_date: 2019-07-12 02:59:28
I feel like over the last week the comments in here have been subtly political, like some group is posting here trying to spread some weird ideas (mostly when you mention paying taxes on investment) and I'm just not sure what to think of it. Just hope everyone is more cautious taking advice from here.
@_date: 2019-07-30 06:18:52
Don't bring logic into this, we are here to bash the gubment or something

So much for it being a safe and anonymous way to send money if it can be tracked like that

7.5 now lul
@_date: 2019-08-02 15:37:07
i'm somehow reminded of those late night tv scams with the coins, where they show the price chart of gold skyrocketing, and you can get the coin for only 25 bucks or so. great gift for the grandkids. except it's just plated gold
@_date: 2019-08-27 11:07:19
i understood some of those words
@_date: 2019-08-05 04:38:55
So it's now a money instead of an investment? I want to spend a good chunk of what I have on something but then I'd have to buy more at the newer higher rates... Meh.
@_date: 2019-10-26 06:46:52
still kinda holding 9.6 better than 7.6
@_date: 2019-08-05 07:36:05
I don't want to say that but a lot of posters here are really suspicious of having some agenda...
@_date: 2019-10-09 07:48:32
Yeah because everyone has whatever you need to hook up to that

this story reminds me of the old dad joke, "do you still take cash?" which really did pre date crypto. what's to keep people from going credit/debit card only if fake bills are too much of a problem?
@_date: 2019-10-16 20:08:43
under 8k again... bought a few more (not whole obviously) i'm pretending to save for my next car, which i plan on buying in like 4 or 5 years. i'm just hoping it keeps doing what it has over the last few years

This comment aged well.

i have a subtle feeling it's just gonna keep trending down. will it really boom when the halvening happens? maybe. will it just go back up to 12k and stay there? maybe. maybe not.

That's what I thought and was happy when it hit 12k now we are right back here. Hmm.
@_date: 2019-10-09 08:47:12
Like how my old co worker can access bitcoin. But not really cause he owns a flip phone
@_date: 2019-06-26 13:37:30
Thanks, yeah we are at a point where we can "waste" money on this. At least for me for the longest time I really didn't have any to spare which is why I never looked into buying any till now.

This is gonna make them quite a bit of money. Even if they don't make much off transactions they will profit a ton just by selling it and people not spending it
@_date: 2019-08-15 06:36:13
Well I was gonna buy something online while I was up to save a few % on something. Guess it's going on the card. Better luck next time

I'm just trying to say the sat network and Bitcoin to some point are useful, but not if you need it now because it takes prep work and hardware that not everyone has.

I put a few bucks in right before 10k, fun stuff. I got a friend to buy some too at 12k and seeing it go up fast might just have got him hooked too.

yeah oddly enough it was last week i got rid of facebook. and i never put pics of myself on there anyways. hence why i don't like sending pics of myself to people online
@_date: 2019-06-20 03:11:43
should i be worried about coinbase wanting a pic of my ID before i can put any money in?
@_date: 2019-06-19 18:55:01
hey that's me. trying to figure out stuff now isn't too much easier than it was quite a while back, with everyone trying to make a dime off of everyone.
@_date: 2019-06-20 02:40:15
ive always wanted to buy some but haven't really had spare cash till now. since missing the big boom i've just kinda ignored it till now and i feel like i'm missing out not having bought anything 3 months ago when it was about half what it is now. yet it might not be a bad time to put a little in in case hitting 10k causes some sort of boom again.
@_date: 2019-06-21 02:06:49

With cb pro you have to wait for the money to clear before you can buy which takes a week or so. With regular cb you can at least lock in the rate (like if it's a quick dip) but can't move the btc till the money clears
