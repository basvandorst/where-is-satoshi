I'm still pissed off I thought about buying some at around 300 in 2014 but was to lazy to look into it beyond downloading a wallet app, now I had to buy in at $2400. Bought a little eth at 220 hope it goes somewhere too but I doubt it. Proly just drop $25 a week into both and see how that goes and if it crashes again ill buy bulk.

Make a support ticket telling them that you are trying to invest several thousand usd but you are going to boot camp soon so you will not be able to invest while your in there. also attach a copy of your id that's what I did last week and they verified me the next morning.

I've been using gemini since June 1st that's when I was verified but they are still withholding all of my btc and eth from me. They say that none of my bank deposits have cleared and that they are all still precredit yet my bank has cleared most of them the one from June 1st has been cleared for 10 days now. Have you experienced anything like this. I just really need access to my btc by tomorrow morning but they still haven't responded to any of my support tickets from 4 days ago.
