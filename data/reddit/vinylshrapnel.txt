Or dollar cost average. Buy as you earn fiat with a periodic purchase. When it drops, you keep buying. No gains lost if you hodl and you still buy the dip.

Who will the first transfer for bitcoin be?

Exactly. House can’t take their cut if only she holds the private keys.

Last year a lot of the lows happened around the 15th of the month. Maybe it’s cyclical.

Pretty sure paper wallets are created on an air gapped computer and printed onto paper on an air gapped printer and put in a secure location, like a safe or a safety deposit box. What you are describing is keeping your keys on your internet connected computer which is never safe. You may be better off using a hardware wallet for future crypto storage. Check the sidebar for more info on storing bitcoins.

Additionally it’s been interesting to see the normal transaction size drop on the exchanges.

I'm not an expert, but I believe it's cheaper to keep pornhub.

This is the real answer.

Sure, but aren't those investments based on centralized trust in a company? If you have to place your money and trust in another human or corporation, then your investments have a greater chance of going to zero. I think there is less of a chance of a limited, decentralized, trustless currency going to zero than any other stock. If there is profit to be made, miners will continue to mine, nodes will continue to validate, day traders will try to stay a step ahead of the market. If the price gets low enough, smart people will buy the dip. 
All that is said assuming there are no unfixable zero day exploits in the code. Or quantum computing strips our ability to secure private keys. This is the only way I can see bitcoin actually going to zero.

The way I understand it is in order to get market price, you must trade on the exchange. If you purchase from the exchange, you are asking said exchange to procure that amount of Bitcoin on your behalf. This incurs a fee above market price due to the exchange either pulling the amount from their storage or procuring it on the active exchange.

And then they fight you.

How can the state prevent people from using a decentralized semi anonymous currency that is already out in the wild? They can prevent more adoption within the borders by shutting down exchanges. But that won't stop local bitcoins. The only thing they could (un)realistically do is shutdown the internet, which would hamper things, but there are still other ways to transact. As far as creating a more widely used coin goes, they kind of already did that with gold and the dollar. The dollar is more widely used, but gold is still seen as a decent store of value. Bitcoin being a limited resource would remain valuable. The decentralization, ecosystem, and developers present a truly trust-less store of value. The cat is out of the bag. As long as people have the ability to secure their private keys, bitcoin will remain a juggernaut. Could bitcoin go to zero? Absolutely, but extremely unlikely. All players would have to no longer see value in it for that to happen. I only see that happening with an unfixable zero day exploit rendering private keys insecure and that might be quantum computing.

Cashing out Bcash is akin to a dividend. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 23:13:12
It's not automatic. You must hold bitcoin (your private keys) before any fork to get the forked coins. For example, to have gotten bcash, you should have bitcoin confirmed before block 478558 (happened early August) and held through it. Then you still have to sell the forked coin on an exchange and wire the money to your account. Again it is not an automated process.

Then we shall hug in the shade!
@_date: 2017-11-26 23:30:57
You should do some research and decide whether it has any demonstrable intrinsic value to you before you put any money into it. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 22:47:48
Hard forks. Bcash, Bgold, etc. I'm not saying it happens as often as stock dividends, but you don't have to sell any of your bitcoin to get them, just as you don't have to sell any stocks to get your dividends. 
@_date: 2019-12-14 03:41:40
Because 21M isn’t the real mathematical limit.
@_date: 2017-11-26 21:34:26
You don't have to cash out any of the asset you bought, i.e. bitcoin, to get it. Since you still retain the original asset, isn't that like a dividend? I'm sure it's still taxed under capital gains though.

Prohibition doesn't work. My original point was that governments have more to lose by taking down the exchanges than the populous does.

Not if you bought the dip.
@_date: 2018-03-19 18:40:14
Without exchanges, the ability to collect taxes on bitcoin gains and transactions greatly diminishes. With 17 million bitcoin already having been mined, local bitcoins would be the way people acquire bitcoin.

Also this doesn’t really fit under the “Bitcoin vs fiat” title.

Sure confirmation times and fees were high, but there was more going on than just high transaction numbers. There was active attacks on bitcoin’s network by the hostile takeover attempt that was bitcoin cash.

It gave bitcoin its first valuation.
@_date: 2019-05-14 16:48:50
Lightning is a big step forward and solves a lot of problems in the scaling debate. Although the network was under attack, it was still quite functional. If someone didn’t want to pay the fees to get through in the next couple of blocks, nobody was forcing them to. If the confirmation of that particular transaction was that important, then the fees would be paid to guarantee priority.

Definitely read an article a couple of days ago saying the same thing about New Hampshire.

True, however the house still wins due to the fees they charge players to play.
