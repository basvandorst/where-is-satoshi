Honestly, anyone looking to buy the dip might be able to save a few months' salary before doing so. Just hold on. Don't rush in and buy.

My thoughts are we could go as low at $8k, $6k pessimistic. The weak hands need to be removed. It's the only way. The hodlers will hold the bottom line and then it will come up again. Each time it will boom and pop, but to a lesser level. If it had kept going higher this time round, it'd have further to fall. Once the baseline value has been established the market will come up again with ever more confidence in Bitcoin.

Ok, so you're saying 50% drop from here, which would be $7000 per coin. I said $8000, or pessimistic view $6000. Shall we call it 6 of one and half a dozen of the other?

Hey, 0.1 bitcoin is pretty hefty! I would absolutely get a hardware wallet for peace of mind. Trezor or Ledger Nano S. A Ledger is only 70 Euros. Well worth it for the security.

Obviously this is really tricky to work out. It is *the* question. My own view, as a hodler who has felt the pain of the losses like all of us, is as follows: take a look at the yearly view on  you can see it was creeping up comfortably to $7000 until 10th November (all dates are approximate), then there was a significant dip to $6000. At that point it lurched back up. Within a week it was pushing $8000 dollars. After that is when the real mania started. From 24th November the gains were enormous - this was the true speculative rush. Now, let's say some proportion of that speculative money, 10% or so, is convinced by the technology and the movement behind Bitcoin, so the dip can only go so low. For this reason I'd say this dip, this bearish movement, has the potential to go to $8000 per coin. Being utterly pessimistic, $6000 per coin, but that is very pessimistic. And then there may well be a drawn out, largely flat period. Once its flat and people see it is not going any lower, they will realise that there is confidence still in this thing and people will begin to store there money again in Bitcoin (remember, a lot of people will be happy if there money just remains at a stable value; the UK has 3% inflation at the moment, so anything better than that is a win).
Here's a theory of how this works: most hodlers would have started out as speculators (they may not admit this!), they believed that they could put some fiat in, realise the gains and then take fiat back out. After going through this cycle, some losing through panic selling (I was one of them once) they learn a bit more and realise that hodling would have served them better over the long term. Their money may have been sitting in their bank account earning 0%. They also realise, once they see the value of cryptocurrency, that one day more and more people will too, so people will prefer to sell property (for instance) for Bitcoin, and many will have to buy Bitcoin (or some crypto) to buy that property. Each dip will settle at a higher point as more and more move to a hodler position.
Hope this is somewhat helpful. Good luck.

No, definitely not. Keep on the ledger because that way you have your private keys under your ownership. You mightwell miss out on the fork if you keep it in an exchange.

Hi there, strongly recommend a hardware wallet which will store your keys. Ledger Nano S or Trezor. Easy to use and gives great peace of mind.

Look at the 2013 burst. It took 2 years to find its bottom and another 2 years to begin a real bull run. This time... 1 year for each? 6 months? I suspect it'll be a while. A lot of people who have hodl'd are just escaping on the upturn at the moment. Wait until the true hodlers remain - the value will flat line. Then when those hodlers begin buying again, it'll slowly rise. Then the speculators come in droves. Then boom. And repeat. Each time, a number of speculators will be coverted to hodlers, so the long term trend is upwards, but you need to be really patient for the long game.

Verge is pretty much make or break with the potential release of its Wraith Protocol. There was a major campaign of FUD yesterday spreading fake news that Wraith was not going to come and general project in disarray etc. The person who claimed that on Twitter claims his account was hacked, but that seems unlikely. Some big whales (possibly him?) loaded up on Verge in the dip. At this moment Verge looks like it might break out of the bearish turn it took yesterday. If you have anything to spare, maybe consider putting a little something into Verge and just hodling.

The most sensible post I've read in a while. People just don't get it! Look at the last crash, see how the bottom forms. Buy time could be 6-12 months away.
