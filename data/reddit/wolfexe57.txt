Search for the file on raspbians desktop os, if you can’t search for it the file didn’t properly download. Re follow though the steps and see if you messed up somewhere along the way. Also by node I’m guessing your trying to run a bitcoin node on a raspberry pi?? Like why the file for the blockchain is way bigger then the micro so card limit on the pi

Back in the day yes! Now their not really a viable option. The raspberry pi dosent have enough computing power to help the network at this point, and the file size for the blockchain is pertty big. You would need to attach a hard drive to the pi to even be able to download it.

For wallet. Any good ol wallet would work. It all depends on what service you trust. Google different wallet types, I for example have a trezor which is offline cold storage but you could easily have your bitcoin stored on a wallet on your phone or even a paper wallet. For a miner there are many a different softwares that could get you where you want to go. A lot of them can be installed through some searching. The easiest one by far and what I would recommend is NiceHash, just enter in your wallet address and it starts mining. 
Hopefully this helps and gets you up and running. If you ever make enough to spare some ;3
