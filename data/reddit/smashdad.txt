Bitcoin is the worlds most trusted, secure and decentralized public ledger.

Damn, you aren't kidding. Looks like u/_money_badger_ called all the dips last night. Further back I see the original pivx and music coin moon shots. I remember those, got a piece of each. Good calls! You got a feed I can follow? I'm a long time crypto dabbler but I don't have time for all the research.

I usually wait until I have a whole bitcoin and then transfer it to my trezor for long term storage. I also move anything I have in there when the price dips bc coinbase counts moving your btc as “selling” it and your tax forms from them will reflect gains and losses accordingly.
But the golden rule of bitcoin is never to leave more on the exchange than you can afford to lose without getting upset.

It gets a little tricky in the states. coinbase is required to keep records of these transactions (not sure of specific thresholds but they probably report all to be safe) for investigations and audits and AML. So they have to decide how to handle the situation where someone is removing an item from their inventory and it’s not cash. For whatever reason, Coinbase has decided to classify that event as a sale in order to simplify their books. Now, just because coinbase records it that way doesn’t mean you can’t file your own version of events when you pay taxes, but if the sums are significant enough you may have to explain yourself in an audit. I try to avoid audits at all costs so choose to move my funds strategically in order to pay what coinbase reports without further complications.

I started out with trezor, tried a ledger, immediately switched back to trezor. I hate that the apps have to be on the device when it doesn’t add functionality. If you could use it as a stand alone device without a pc I would understand, but as is it’s just a hassle for very little payoff.
