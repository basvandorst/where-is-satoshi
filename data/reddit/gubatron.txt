Good luck with that vision while it's so volatile, like now, it's simply a speculative asset that can be used for transfer value for a limited number of people everyday.
Unless you have massive use, massive acceptance of Bitcoin as an exchange of value you will never be able to achieve the vision of Gold 2.0 because the price is otherwise easily manipulated.
Therefore without scalability, your Gold 2.0 vision is still a dream.
Scalability =&gt; Adoption =&gt; Price Stability =&gt; Savings in Bitcoin
Until then, your best bet to store wealth is on a very stable currency, even gold itself sucks.

"On August 6th a COP $103,495,995 (USD $34,528) transactional volume was registered, the highest it had during the last five weeks.
Nonetheless, Colbitex had to shut down eight days after opening its operations officially. The Colombian authorities in charge, The Financial Superintendence of Colombia, holds everything with tweezers if it has anything to do with digital currencies, considering as legal only the transactions that have an equivalence with Colombian Pesos. Bitcoin has no such equivalence as the country does not consider it a real currency. The Superintendence also prohibits using Bitcoin to receive or send digital payments."

What if the solution proposed by Satoshi is one that's on the table right now and which you have a lot of reasons not to agree with?
Meanwhile, let's see how it goes for banks and how they will start solving their challenges and conflicts. 
I agree we're in a complete clusterfuck, but I think it's as a result of a great solution, which is not easy to come by. The creativity displayed with Seggregated Witness is admirable, and hopefully along with a block increase to 2Mb it will buy us more time. But we need a truly big change, perhaps a completely different network and blockchain topology so that Bitcoin can have the scalability flag gone forever.
Or perhaps you're right, maybe all projects of this caliber need the likes of a Linus-Torvalds like leader figure?
I think if Satoshi is/are out there, and he/they still care[s], and he/they does/do have a solution that will speak for itself, nothing is stopping him/them from creating another identity and submitting the idea for debate.
@_date: 2015-12-17 15:59:21
And this is [what I think they're doing]( do not underestimate an enemy that has been doing this for 200 years and manages trillions. 
The banks have heard us loud and clear, we showed them what is possible with blockchains and they're not stupid. Fed up core developers are working for R3 now, people like Mike Hearn who developed the bitcoin libraries you use on almost every android wallet stopped playing games and are building blockchains that will be scalable and massively adopted without the issues of token price volatility. To the end user, it will be like using Bitcoin, but with their banks and in dollars, no XCoins to buy, they'll use their fiat currency, and no, it won't be a simple distributed database, it will be a next gen highly scalable blockchain without the need for miners. Not all blockchains need miners, currency can be issued without huge CPU expenditure, they'd just have nodes to validate and propagate transactions.
Read about R3 and stop being so cocky about Bitcoin, Bitcoin is still an experiment that cannot scale, people are blind and deaf to how a clusterfuck is coming with full blocks and a reward halfing in the next months, added to that a possible increase in activity ON-chain with things like OpenBazaar which is almost out for a first release.

I think the lack of incentives for running a full node (for people not running some sort of bitcoin related service) trumps even the friendliest interfaces, there's just no reason to run a full node.

Finally someone in reality.
Let's add to this how easy it'd be to create fake drivers, and fake riders in the system. Then request fake rides to drive real drivers away from real customers and frustrate them, and have fake drivers pretend they're stuck in traffic before picking real users up.
So much can go wrong, specially with a company like Uber who repeatedly has played very dirty against competition, it would cost them a mere $50-$100k a month to have a dedicated team of p2p hackers and chinese monkeys sybyl attacking the fuck of that p2p network.
Also add that even if you succeeded you'd need some other cryptocurrency that could scale. Uber alone does 10x the entire transactional volume of Bitcoin, so you'd need to have at least 10Mb more per block to keep it going.
Let's see what will happen when OpenBazaar starts doing just 100k transactions (doubling today's blocksize) a day if Bitcoin-Core developers will finally get it, let's see if those "2-year block doubling proposals" still make sense.

[their technology is being open sourced]( they'd be stupid not to make the blockchain itself open (it seems to me they will as they have already said their source is open) and miss out on disrupting and swallowing so many billion dollar industries.
The only thing that shouldn't be open should be the issuance and destruction of tokens into the chain like on the bitcoin model where there is no central trust and trust has been moved to proof of work.
On their model, you could get rid of proof of work for minting new blocks, new blocks don't necessarily have to add or remove tokens unless necessary (e.g. people are transferring money from their checking accounts into their blockchain accounts, or viceversa), all banks have to do is verify the money is moving from somewhere else into the tokens and then sign with one of the federated signatures that transaction into the block.
As side effects you get: No volatility as you're dealing in fiat but on a blockchain, you can have multiple blockchain accounts in different currencies, and since new blocks only require being signed it can scale like a motherfucker given the banks have the opportunity to pursue far better data structure alternatives and they can all guarantee multimillion dollar data centers behind the blockchain operation. 
Blockchain technology like Bitcoin is 1st generation, there's so much you can do, can't believe how narrow minded people can be. This is software, so much is possible.

Looks like someone stopped drinking the Bitcoin koolaid and didn't want to bet the company on it. Makes sense.
From his point of view it must look like this:
- Bitcoin has all the potential in the world to do A, B, C,... but only for a very limited amount of people if it's to be done in a truly decentralized way.
- It won't scale if the blockchain is linear, it will simply be bogged down eventually by more transactions it won't be able to distribute fast enough.
- Keeping the blocksize small won't let it scale but to a handful of people daily worldwide, transactions will make it too expensive
- If they can't even agree on changing a stupid blocklimit, by the time they figure out they need a major structural change on the way transactions are stored and transfered, a competing cryptocurrency will be able to make bitcoin look like crap and scale with maybe even better incentives.
- In the meantime, I'll be open minded and look for the solutions necessary to bring what I envisioned I could've done with bitcoin, let me help people now.
- I'll let Bitcoin be one of the possible assets, but for now, it's nothing more than a especulative digital asset, the inspiration of what's to come if it doesn't hurry the fuck up and scales cheaply.

And in the event that it actually works, Lightning Network makes it undesirable to mine blocks, which is very unhealthy for the network.
Why? Imagine years ahead when the block reward is minimum, at that point you want blocks to have as many transactions as possible so the fees can subsidize mining.
If you move a massive number of transactions of chain, there will be no fees for miners, miners leave, blockchain vulnerable, game over.

it doesn't have to be centralized, it can be very decentralized, however control is centralized through super keys owned by the banker's federation.
Bankers can issue blocks with the transactions from their account holders, there could be multiple blockchains for different currencies, hell you could run a full node if you had the capacity, but the one thing you won't be able to do, will be mining new tokens, that'll be reserved for them as they settle money from savings and checking accounts in and out of their interbanking blockchains.

Less complaining and more coding. Most core coders are figuring out way more important problems to keep the system running and scaling so the whole Bitcoin experiment won't collapse, sadly they're not the best at UI design/experience and they require help.

hiring, marketing, regulation, litigation issues, PR, background checks, integrating with other platforms (spotify, now an app button).
A lot can go wrong and Uber is a ruthless competitor (just imagine how Uber would hack it in so many ways, making fake orders to fuck with drivers, take them away from real customers, introduce fake drivers on the network and people never get picked up...). It'd be pretty hard for something that deals with people's physical safety to run autonomously until you have sentient AI, at which point the AI would decide to make that money for itself.
@_date: 2015-12-04 12:10:41
maybe that token can scale...
Uber alone does over 10x more transactions daily than Bitcoin :_), you'd need **at least** 10mb blocks (with today's blockchain linear structure) just to support this system (and what about the rest of the world transacting? everyone waiting on the mempool?) if you wanted to let people pay in a fully decentralized way without intermediaries, meaning on-chain.

However, in practice this is irrelevant, because who the hell will send you the products if you're unable to phisically keep operating.

In the meantime these transitional systems will help to recruit tens of millions of users which will be great for leveraging against banks, which keep talking more and more about blockchain based tech.

Simply not enough demand for Bitcoin.
Once there's a reason to spend Bitcoin, there will be demand for Bitcoin. Support projects like OpenBazaar or anything that enables trading of all kinds of things.
If you could buy all sorts of shit with Bitcoin you would, right now, I can't even buy a coffee.
Then there's the issue that we can't really build anything that drives demand because of the scalability limitations.
If something like OpenBazaar were to be fully working in 3 months, and an exponential number of ebay and amazon sellers install openbazaar, we would make the blockchain collapse, as it can only take less than 5 transactions per second before filling up the blocks, which would then make every other transaction after that take forever to be confirmed, then people would say this Bitcoin shit isn't working... so, there's a lot to wait for.

A single bitcoin marketplace going popular on the internet (I'm thinking something like openbazaar, that requires on-chain transactions) will make the confirmations for everyone else start to suck unless they start paying higher and higher fees.
Bitcoin is still very experimental if you think about it and very much at risk of collapsing if adopted by the mainstream even just a little.

perhaps when they showed them Bitcoin can only support no more than 7tx/sec they laughed. We gotta stop being religious about Bitcoin and admit it's far from perfect, it just happens to enjoy a small network effect, but in reality it's not that big, we're actually super tiny still. If anything we should learn from what these other cryptocurrencies are doing to scale.
@_date: 2015-06-20 23:44:14
So looking at full blocks today, a block with nearly 1Mb in size holds between 1400 transactions to 2600 transactions (just taking a look at  recent almost full blocks).
That gives us an average transaction size in bytes of ~348 bytes up to ~714.
So, if we were optimistic, and transactions would all be on the lower end, by 2016, with just 16MB, in a period of ~10 minutes you would only fit ~46k transactions. If you divide that by 10 minutes, you get 4.6k tx/min, if you divide that by 60 seconds, you get a mere 76 transactions per second.
So this solves nothing by 2016. If people keep evangelizing and hyping Bitcoin, it will start to get real usage and this thing is going to stop working and the BTC value will majorly drop as nobody believes in a system that can only handle a mere 76 transactions per second.
Regardless of what devs. think Bitcoin is, this technology is being sold to everyone (and bought by investors pouring in millions) as Banking, Money Transmitting, Stock Market, and 
XYZ decentralized killer, it's a permissionless system, and legitimate traffic of minimum adoption (with the network being avaialable worldwide) can come from any where without it being malicious.
A block limit right now is just a huge risk to everyone involved, it will collapse by its own weight with such limitations.

In all seriousness, go to every exchange, and count how much bitcoin in USD is for sale, and how much USD is on the sell side, and you will have your answer. There's still not enough buyers, I wouldn't buy, but I'm still holding like a spartan since the $900s (I know... :( )

there's always black markets to make transfers, Venezuelans and Argentinians have had to dealt with these limitations to survive for over 15 years.
To make it work, you need to have an international bank account outside of Greece, you look for a friend that needs to send money to Greece, you deposit money in their greek account, and they deposit/transfer money to your international account.
For those that don't have international accounts... LocalBitcoins/Bitcoin.

stop thinking linearly. Bitcoin is hardly used at this point. If it starts getting used because of a big brand or an entire country finds it attractive you will need GB sized blocks.
even 20mb will be too little. there cant be limits, blocks should adjust based on transactional volume. 
full nodes should be running in the cloud anyways. people who want to run a full node on a shitty connection only slow the rest down.

There's a very arrogant attitude in the Bitcoin community, it's quite ridiculous when you look objectively at our current size and how fast banks could outpace bitcoin adoption the day they have an open interbanking blockchain like the one described in the essay.
Banks already heard us loud and clear, there's 20bn already invested **in series A alone** of fintech startups.
[Banks are being threatened]( by lots of different fintech startups, adopting blockchain/blockdag technology could help them shake off a lot of those competitors.
They're very aware, they have entire departments looking closely at all fintech related threads, they're investing in some of them, there's too much at stake for them to lose and for them to gain, they know retail banking could be unnecessary if Bitcoin could scale and if it were stable in terms of price. They know they can take over many of the industries we'd like Bitcoin to disrupt. They know and they're taking this seriously.

Way to go After all that long time you finally did it man!
Make sure you take into consideration a pre-amble when creating a paid .torrent, make sure users don't easily incurr into criminal copyright infringement.
It should be clearly explained when creating a paid torrent that the creator must own the rights to that content. Otherwise we'll have rampant, true, criminal, "piracy" over bittorrent, and I think that's the last thing we want both for the Bitcoin and Bittorrent communities.

All banks need to do right now to take Bitcoin down is to promote it in the mainstream media "Please, try Bitcoin!"
If someone can convince enough people to do just 100 transactions per second worldwide during one day (a.k.a. nothing in terms of transactional volume), while this whole Block size limit issue isn't solved, the system will collapse and people will sell out when they see money can't go from A to B in a reasonable time.

now that I know it can be implemented with payment channels this is how we'd do it, but we'd need a 3 way payment channel.
Where every piece is paid in proportion to what the content creator has specified in the original torrent.
The idea is basically adding signed metadata on the torrent when the content creator decides to share paid content on the network.
The content creator sets what percentage of payments go to seeders.
every payment channel update is accepted by the seeder if the content creator is getting paid in the proportion specified.
This is not a solution to kill piracy, as it's impossible, it's just an incentive to do the right thing. You as a seeder would probably prefer seeding the legal torrent and getting paid, than creating a new free torrent. Also, you'd be liable for criminal copyright infringement if you created a paid torrent and pretended to be the content creator, now that would be stealing.

The biggest issue is long term, Bitcoin is deflationary and the block rewards will get smaller and smaller as the time goes by.
If you don’t have a huge number of transactions per block which pay fees, there will be no incentive to keep miners running.
You want as many transactions on chain as possible to keep Bitcoin attractive to miner, otherwise they’ll repurpose all their mining equipment onto the next compatible cryptocurrency and sell out all their bitcoins as soon as they can.

~ 2 weeks sounds like not enough to address possible legitimate transactional volume spikes.
Think Madonna going on tour in Europe (each venue taking about 100k people and she's doing 10 cities) and she says she'll be accepting Bitcoin tomorrow on the first 5 cities, a Major Bittorrent client launching seeding paid for via micropayment channels (which have to be opened and closed on the blockchain, so at least 2 transactions per channel) and people wanting to make money day/night with their bandwidth, or OpenBazaar or a similar product actually working (and not possibly transacting offchain) and all of a sudden thousands and thousands of ebay store owners moving over, Or simply a bank run in Venezuela, Greece, Argentina, etc. that could raise transactional volume 100x for hours at the time, this wouldn't catch up.
I believe we could use a more aggresive function that takes into consideration the blocks of the past hour (just 6) to try to predict the slope of the volume for the next blocks.
Based on this slope or rate of change in volume, you'd also try to adjust a minimum suggested fee to guarantee your transaction will make it on the next block.
@_date: 2015-12-27 07:14:14
i guess the point they make is that demands like these are absurd, and it's a good thing developers have that power as they actually understand how the damn thing works, and that you can't just let people tune bitcoin in whatever crazy way they think it's supposed to work because the network would collapse in a few days.

Bitcoin is an open network, regardless of what the devs think it's for, it will be used for what people think it's for and they have very little control of that, therefore it should be prepared for what people want it to be used for, and people will want to use what has been promised to them:
 * Banking without banks (the other something billion unbanked that Andreas kept evangelizing left and right),  
 * sending money to other people like email, paying for cabs, coffee, and what not...

If you can't take your money out of the bank, that's pretty much money seized by the government, no?
Then your euros will be "sold" for whatever initial market price there is in the new local currency, and then you will be able to take that new currency out.
Then after that Greece Central Bank will print shitload of new local coind and your savings will go to the shitter, because with this new currency they will try to pay for their internal debt.

what happens to the other 97,300 transactions, plus all the regular transaction volume of the network.
would people start to freak out when they can't receive money they were expecting after hours of wait? will they start getting transaction dropped errors?
would this cause a panic in markets making the prices drop as some scared speculators start selling out?

don't spend it all in one place :)
To give you any suggestions, maybe it'd be nice to know what interests you have, what problems do you want to solve, being an MIT student one tends to think you are a very capable person, perhaps there's an intersection between a problem, your technological talents/interests, and where Bitcoin might fit in.
Don't just spend it, use it to experiment as you build something the world needs.
However, grab a bit of it so you learn the basics, transfer a tiny amount so you see what can't be done with credit cards, split it into different wallets, maybe play with the bitcoin apis available and learn more about the blockchain, a very interesting thing to look at is colored coins (how you can basically tag satoshis to give them a different meaning, for instance, you could grab 100k satoshis and mark them as say, invites for some service online, then use those satoshis as a way to get in and setup an account, thus you getting the satoshis back, an obvious idea is using them to issue shares or votes)

the moment it becomes illegal converting white to black, and people actually go for that, then bitcoin is dead, as you're forcing it to become dependent on a centralized entity. Bitcoin will not be regulated by any single government entity, it is not currency from any single country, it's free to move on the internet without any borders or centralized limitations.
I just don't see this happening at all. It's been designed to make it super easy to create a new wallet, good luck on trying to regulate that.

they had chosen profit and control from the very beginning, the moment they decided not to let you run apps from outside the AppStore.
Let's hope everyone gets to see the real issue here, it's not just about Apple Banning bitcoin, it's about them not letting you run whatever apps you want on your phone without voiding the phone's warranty after going for jailbreaking solutions.
they want to pull the same shit on desktop, only they give you an option to run third party apps. Developers like me have been forced to buy certificates from them in order to not get error messages when apps are installed on Mac.
it's just that MacOSX has a small userbase and the complains don't get heard, but there's a lot of people who don't ever get to the security preferences screen and think that software coming from outside the appstore is broken.
They have evil error messages and on iOS it's just ludacris.

For Americans needing other stories:
My cousin is 19 years old.
He just escaped Venezuela's communism to Colombia, so he can study, work and live a normal life.
He does graphic design, but he cannot get paid via Paypal, Paypal there requires him to have a credit card.
Getting a credit card when you're 19 in Colombia, with no steady job (he's a student) is pretty much impossible, he barely has a bank account (and no desire to deal with banks and fees that pretty much empty the little he has in his account)
How does he get paid?
1. Effing XOOM/Western Union which take ridiculous fees.
2. Through favors, peoplein the US who have Bank Accounts in Colombia
He wishes every client would just pay him in Bitcoin.
No banks, no wait, no fees (in comparison) and he can use the bitcoins to buy things online, or pay other people there.

when you get to employ someone in a country where your credit card/bank wires/etc don't work, you will see how Bitcoin will be an attractive option for you to use.
For anything else, it's still unnecessary for you as you seem to live in a first world country with a mature banking infrastructure.

gotta have a dream to motivate you. everyday that I contribute I'm motivated to just make this happen, this needs to exist.
I've been part of many startup companies and failed many many times, this time around, having such an early beta, we're getting so much positive attention, world wide media coverage, we know we're on to something, so we just gotta keep working on it and give our best.
It's also the necessity of seing things done they way you want them to be done, and in the process learning from other amazing people.
In the end if we fail, I'm sure I'll have learned a lot of valuable lessons so I don't make the same mistakes again, there's always something good you can take out from every adventure.

I've had the unpleasant chance of being under Federal investigation, I didn't have a gag order, but as part of the negotiation we had to do things to our software that made things really uncomfortable for our users, we got plenty of shit about it, lost a ton of them...
sometimes companies aren't stupid, or incompetent, sometimes they just have the foot of the government on their neck along with dealing with lawyers and not being able to sleep much.
At the beginning of january when Shrem got arrested, there were some posts here on reddit that talked about the possibility of Gox being involved in that investigation, something that was pretty plausible as the majority of the bitcoin traded went in and out.
Then I heard another post about people getting fired, and at that moment i cancelled or my orders and took the bitcoins out. weeks later here we are, I was lucky, and what Rism is saying is very plausible.

yeah, but you use a key only to perform a cryptographic signature, you can disconnect from the network to perform the signature, then you have the signed transaction, then you connect to the network, then send it. the private key never has to be accessible to any other network node.

because people are willing to pay you more. if nobody did, then the price would be lower. people are making money off of it, as long as there is someone that will pay so much more there will be someone greedier than you to take that opportunity. Simple supply and demand.
some people dont have a way to buy bitcoins online. they dont have SSNs or bank accounts, so there is a huge convenience in being able to get bitcoins.
you can always lower the price and offer your coins cheaper and your coins will be bought way faster. And then you will realiza the mistake you made as a seller as you see your supply deplete fast and then the price going back up again. You would need a lot more coins if you want to tame the price down, this is market manipulation basically.
then there are other people out there with a LOT of cash, who tend to work on the street selling illegal things, they dont mind the premium as long as they remain private, and on the seller side, dealing with these individuals poses a great deal.of personal risk, they could have their keys stolen at gun point or be forced to send all of their bitcoins and possibly get killed in tue process, and this is probably the main reason for that price. I dont know if there is a study out there but such a high premium suggests the buying side is LOADED with a lot of easy cash that needs to be laundered.

I've not yet studied their api in detail, I know they have a way to interface with it via rest, which is quite clever.
My approach though will try to behave as distributed asynchronous file system, I think If I can make it all the way as a real posix file system that'd be even better. This way you don't really need any api to interact with the file system, from an API perspective I guess the only thing you'd need to do would be to setup the folder where you will be doing the sharing with your key, or set of keys. I believe not everyone should have the same rights on the folder, some users should just be able to read, so there'd be a way in the API to generate write keys and read-only keys.
All content is encrypted and as you sign on to the DHT, you are forced to seed content near your bucket, as well as your own. I suppose this is how they are doing it to have enough seeds for all the encrypted content.

"if a malicious agent is able to access the private cryptographic keys of one of the donation targets, they are able to game the system and manipulate trust arbitrarily. Compromising the private cryptographic keys can be achieved through various ways by powerful agents; for example, a secret warrant can be issued by a government ordering that the private keys are handed to the court.
This attack would work as follows: The malicious agent first generates a new OpenBazaar identity. Subsequently, they donate a small amount of bitcoin to the donation target organization they have compromised, including their OpenBazaar node as their target identity in the proof-of-donation, thereby gaining a certain amount of trust. They then use the private keys they control to give the money back to themselves, potentially through a certain number of intermediaries to avoid trackability. Finally, they repeat the process an arbitrary amount of times to gain any amount of trust desired, thereby gaming the system."

on the non technical white paper there's something very important not mentioned: "price", "pricing"
how do you determine pricing? is there some sort of bidding system so that your nodes compete with other nodes to provide storage/bandwidth? (saw a mention of the word "bidding" in relationship to cloudcoins for investors)
I suppose eventually you should be adding decentralized-sandboxed runtime cpu (I'm thinking of being able to execute python code, ruby, php, java, mono, etc) so that you don't just end up with a p2p CDN, but also give users the ability to execute code and serve dynamic content, execute map/reduce tasks, etc.
Hopefully pricing will be cheaper than AWS, but this would mean a lot of the nodes shouldn't be hosted on AWS but on colos by people who can manage to get great deals on bandwidth and hardware. In my personal experience I gave up on colos, and if Bitcloud were available here today, I'd use it to offset my costs on the idle bandwidth and storage that I may have.  will subscribe to @_date: 2014-02-06 04:49:29

what do you mean governments can't control money supply?
The Venezuelan government completely controls money supply in Venezuela and this is the root cause of all the problems in the country. Our country has historically been managed through devaluation by the BCV.
If Venezuelans were in control of their currency Maduro would have absolutely no power. There'd be a powerful media with the means to shut him down, there'd be organizations taking care of all the issues, but without a currency worth anything no sector of society can take matters into their own hands, so yes, Governments can control money supply, centralized money supply is centralized for that very reason.
They strangle the main dollar supply coming from the oil rent, what gets in outside their power is just a trickle from individuals and rare companies that somehow still want to do business in that environment.
You say it yourself, they can only access other currency to a black market that's created precisely because of the rules they have imposed.
And yes, that's the goal, we want you to stop taking US Dollars and start transacting directly in Bitcoins, charge people outside the US in bitcoins, then if you want to convert them to UD Dollars just go to Gyft.com and buy gift cards (as the easiest way to do it without having a US Bank account) or sell them for USD/Euro in Bitcoin exchanges abroad.

Also add to that all the people in the world without access to credit cards but which together have trillions of dollars that could now flow on the internet, just think of all the people under 18 who can't have credit cards and who could be given allowances in bitcoin and who could now do business with anyone in the planet.

if you have a decent understanding of how public and private keys work you should read satoshi's paper, it's a short paper and you will get it immediatly.
basically, when a transaction is created, the emitting party will sign the transaction using his key along with a number that's hard to come up with, this number takes about 10 minutes to be generated because when hashed together with the transaction parameters, the final hash it must meet certain characteristics (proof of work) and paraphrasing it's basically a hash of the emitting party's public key concatenated with the timestamp of the transaction concatenated with the amount being transfered and that random number, when hashed, the hash must have... say its leftmost 20 bits all set to zero, for this to happen, you gotta try a shitload of random numbers (while keeping all the other parameters fixed), this random number I believe is called the "nonce". The transaction also contains output scripts, the basic output script says the receiving party has to have a certain public key.
The transaction is sent over the network with all these parameters as part of a transaction block, then miners can verify all the parameters quickly (as they don't have to recalculate the proof of work again), as more and more miners verify the transaction, the transaction block grows, and this transaction block will be part of what we call the blockchain, which is the distributed leger.
this is how value is transfered. only the party that has the outgoing public key in the transaction will be asigned the bitcoin, and the emitting party will not have the right to use that bitcoin again (no double spending)
if you wanted to attack the network, you'd need to have a huge amount of mining power so that you could append a fake transaction that would meet all those requirements to the blockchain. during the time you're trying to fake it, more transactions will come in, and all the peers in the network know they will always prefer the blockchains that are the longest.
it's really brilliant and simple at the same time.

i think the possibility of an attacker getting a hold of the keys of a charity is very slim, and if they did so, the attacker would be more likely to just steal the balance of that account than to use it to create a reputation in OB.

actually usage will be huge from countries where people can't get credit cards as easily as in the US.
Once there's enough liquidity say in Argentina, Venezuela, Colombia, people there will start using the currency not just to buy goods from american websites, but they'll finally get to enjoy the benefits of ecommerce we've enjoyed for years in the first world within their own regions.
What'll happen is that these countries will start selling many items at cheaper prices than what we get here, and then people over here will notice that they can buy some things cheaper there, making the internet and the world a more competitive place.
then there's also the moment where all the immigrants in the US realize they don't have to pay western union, or xoom huge transfer fees when they send money back home every month, they will start feeding their home economies with bitcoin, not US dollars, wonder what that effect will have in the price of the US dollar worldwide.
usage will be huge, there's room for all, but there will be no value to the currency if there are no investors backing the system at this point in time, only big companies, institutional investors and rich people looking for huge capital gains during the next 10 to 15 years will be the ones to bring the next huge multi billion dollar round of funding to the bitcoin economy, banks will join, governments will have to join and have their own reserves.
it's easy to see.

depends on which part of the curve you are, this could very well be the elbow of it. Most people out there don't want to run full nodes, or even install software to have bitcoin wallets, they want to access their bitcoins from different places and they think blockchain is safer than the level of security they'll provide for bitcoin, the blockchain.info app is the default recomendation, and it's being recommended virally, I do see the begin of exponential growth in that graphic.

Just stare at any random minute of Blockchain transactions in realtime and you will see that Bitcoin is not something that will happen, it's already moving a LOT of value TODAY. 
No identity required, no government permission is required, no regulations are required to use it except the rules of its protocol. 
It's already working and people are moving anywhere from pennies to millions of dollars worth of bitcoins everyday without asking banks or governments for permission, all this wether you believe in it or not.

We are looking for help to build our next UI at OpenBazaar. it is a voluntary job, but enough commits merged will surely land you several job offers a week. I think we are building a multibillion dollar per year technology that will not only compete with the likes of Amazon, Alibaba and eBay, but our technology will enable the further development of commercial verticals such as p2p lending, insurance, shipping, automated drone market places... anything that can be put into smart contracts.
if you are long in Bitcoin, you can see the time spent on this project as the best way to make your investment grow in value. The launch of OpenBazaar will mean a tremendous increase in commercial trading done on Bitcoin, causing Bitcoin to become more useful as it will buy you a long tail of things/services, meaning you will need more bitcoin thus driving the demand and possibly the price up.
in the meantime you will learn different technologies and work with an international team, the learning experience alone will be worth thousands of dollars in education and make you a more valuable programmer with proven experience in the cryptocurrency industry, thus you will have credible leverage for finding that job you want (that is if you will want to do something else, as if we make this happen we know honest funding will not be an issue to support a formal team full time if we incorporate as a non for profit)

best explanation so far.
now, what happens once the price of the ETF starts to go up as it'll be a symbol of its own, with its own offer/demand dynamics.
There's going to be a surplus in the valuation, even if it's 1:1 ratio.
When the price is higher than the average price in the exchanges, will they buy more bitcoin to back the value of the ETF?
@_date: 2014-06-27 13:59:14
so minus (at least 35% on fucking federal income taxes, not considering state taxes...)... you end up with &lt; $650,000 in hand.
Of that I'd invest about 15% on bitcoins, so like $100k in Bitcoin, at today's price ($586) that's BTC 170, not bad.
Of those BTC 170, I'd probably move BTC 50 between 2 or 3 exchanges and start swing/day trading/arbitraging.
The rest I'd put in Stocks, High Yield ETFs, Treasury Bonds, Cash, and leave about $150k to do Swing/Day/Option Trading on an account with leverage.

on payment delay: I've sucessfully managed to never owe a single dime to a credit card company. For me using credit cards has always been about just about the convenience of not carrying cash (and not puting my cash at risk with the possibility of getting a debit card cloned - chargebacks), I can't deal with debt in my mind, never spent more than what I can make, and not having debt just puts you in a better position mentally (cash in hand)
As for speculating on the price, I'd set aside some coins for doing that, not my day to day money, bitcoin is too volatile to asume that the price will rise during the period you'd wait on paying for your debt, which makes me think things are going to get really interesting when bitcoin-credit-card companies come out and bitcoin futures come out, the dynamics of the price will be quite interesting as people will try to game those companies, and they will try to bet on the price going down so they can cover your debt cheaper in fiat, oh man.

so what would be your incentive to have enough people running enough miners so no 51% attack easily happens... will you pay your voters in vote coin? (if you could exchange it for tax breaks or food stamps the election would be too costly) you then start thinking hard about it... very hard for this to happen, we will have to use guess which robust and diverse blockchain...?, the most robust one there is. oh.. the incentive here is bitcoin.
it happens to all those altcpins, they quickly collapse once a greedy miner with lots of of old bitcoin mining equipment comes in and takes over, fucks everything.
bitcoin is part of a successful blockchain technology. cant do shit with blockchain theory if you dont have enough incentivized miners, everything that is announced after bitcoin, as good as it sounds, will always seem to us like another altcoin, fuck em, we will just make bitcoin better.

should be the same as if you run an online store, you probably have to comply to your local tax authorities, at least you should report some form of income or sales tax depending on your jurisdiction.
It's up to the seller, not to OpenBazaar. OpenBazaar just gives you the tools to run a store on your own hardware.
If a seller doesn't report his taxes it's his sole responsability and will probalby have to face his local tax authorities, tax evation has nothing to do with the protocol, or bitcoin, or internet trade. it's just about being a responsible citizen and conforming to the law and declaring properly.

(I'm not speaking for the OpenBazaar team, these are my own opinions)
You can always implement filters at the client level when it comes to P2P, however, content removal is pretty much impossible once it's out (even on a non-p2p network, someone can always make a copy before removal)
Every tool made by man can be used for illegal purposes, you could grab your car and run over a bunch of people, the ways to deter you from doing that are moral and of course legal.
You go and do something bad and you'll get caught, and you'll pay for it, same thing in the virtual space, you can put child porn anywhere, but you'll get caught and you'll do time for that. To avoid for things like Child Porn we have laws and law enforcement.
I personally joined the project because of the HUGE possibilities within the legal space, I believe what we're building here will level the playing field for a lot of people that can't/won't sell under the current centralized e-commerce tools that charge for listing fees, seller fees, out-of-their-ass fees, and the restrictions they impose over what can and cannot be sold, even if it's absolutely legal to sell, just because it might be against the corporate strategy of the company providing the platform.
By taking out that middle man, the cost % taken off from every transaction will be an immediate efficiency improvement in the way people shop, added to that how efficient/convenient it is to transact with Cryptocurrencies vs the antiquated and limiting payment systems we have today.
If someone will want to use the OpenBazaar technology for other nefarious purposes I doubt it will serve their needs, they will probably have to fork the project, name it something else and create their own underground network, I  would like to see our project compete for legitimate stores, and enable an unimaginable amount of goods/money to be traded in a way that couldn't have possibly existed before Bitcoin + OpenBazaar.
And also I still have a hard time understanding, why in the world would someone go and transact illegal goods on top of a:
- open p2p network on which every government agency can have nodes running (even if traffic were to be encrypted)
- buy/pay with a crytocurrency which has A PUBLIC LEDGER. Money would eventually be traced back to the perps and a criminal conviction would be even easier to achieve.

you should trade options, futures or in forex if you want to trade past 4pm. there's also other markets, and you can short stock. You're also more likely to get burned as the markets have high frequency traders and some of the smartest people in the planet strategizing to get the retail guys, for an individual investor like us, it's like putting an amateur basketball player against the Miami Heat, you can't stand a chance, and bitcoin markets are getting that way, I think everything since december has had a lot to do with wallstreet money already being here.
as for the fees, you can get a margin account and trade with a lot of money, the earnings per trade make the trading fees insignificant, but yes, it's a very rotten space as you're paying comission to a bunch of middlemen and 13 exchanges that are HEAVILY regulated.
coming in the other direction one of the things that was unbelieavable with bitcoin was the low trading fees, the volatility, and the amount of noobs trading... bitcoin markets are highly inneficient for now, so enjoy while it lasts.

I like debating Bitcoin. One of the interesting aspects to argue on the economic side come from the people that say that given the deflationary nature of a fixed numbe of coins, you won't be able to help people as there will be no incentive to lend (or to borrow at a reasonable rate for the borrower).
they say that this would end up hurting productivity and economic growth as people won't be able to lend money.

Where you ask yourself if this is just some experiment, or a technological fad that will die. Once you see people moving money like that, even in the millions, then you know this is real, that's what I meant by believing in it, which then got me to open my trading accounts and back my belief by buying, trading and working for bitcoins.

why realize the loss if you don't have to, specially if you're sure it's going to be worth waaaaay more than $1k in the future?
if you don't invest that which you are willing to lose, then you probably need the money and then you ask your self "why do these guys haven't realize their loss?"
those holding, obviously don't need the fiat, have the time to wait, and understand this is all part of the volatility necesary to bitcoin's adoption.

For all we know sathoshi is the NSA, therefore he used SHA-256 as the hashing algorithm which was created by the NSA. Perhaps the NSA knows of a mathematical backdoor function that can generate a nonce with as many zeros to the left as they want given some other hashing data... which would in turn allow them to have a killswitch on an experiment to give the world a single unit of currency, that can be tracked and which is infinitely superior to fiat, control the currency, control the people... global currency, global control.

Take a look at the OpenBazaar project, we're creating a protocol for ecommerce/etrade based on the notion of Smart Contracts, A network of Peer to Peer Notaries and of course Bitcoin as the payment mechanism.

if you live outside the US, there's no DVD to buy in many places. Hell you might not even have a DVD player, but you might have a smartphone, or netbook.
There's no need for feeding the middlemen in an information economy.
Paying for a DVD means paying for all the people involved and the energy spent to bring that disc to your hands, that's extremely inneficient and the artist really gets very little of what you send.
This way you send a payment to the artist, get the file pretty much with very little CO2 emissions, and the artist gets to keep 100%!!!!

yes there would. one model doesn't exclude the other, the content creator will want as much money as it can.
@_date: 2014-02-05 20:17:49
it is if you take into account -$20 for every chargeback, plus not having the money as it's being floated by the credit card companies for days.
As a merchant I'd do bitcoin transactions any day over the scam credit card processors are running on everyone, the risk of a Chipotle customer being able to do a double spend and rewriting the blockchain are fairly low, and all I'd be losing would be the cost of an average meal.
As for the speed, the Simple Payment verification is almost instant, I'd say faster than the credit card overall as you don't even have to sign with a pen, print, etc. Bitcoin pwns.
Way better than CCs.
@_date: 2014-02-28 12:41:58
yes, this is very close to what we have in mind.
However there's always the issue of dispute resolution and the possibility of another peer in the swarm sending you the piece (for free) that you were sort of "bidding" for, and then there's the issue of the piece arriving, and the target not wanting to pay for it, so we need to figure out a way to truly prove the piece did get there (maybe through a randomly chosen peer in the swarm, but what if it's only 2 peers in it only) 
So there needs to be a few pre-conditions to establish these paid chunk transfers, like having enough peers, starting the requesting chunk transfer with an unspendabble output on the transfer which only becomes spendable after a condition verifiable by both exists, but this is where I get lost. I imagine implementing this logic on the bitcoin tx script, what I don't get is how often this script is executed so the output becomes spendable once the conditions are met (and I still haven't got a clue as to what that condition looks like)

I think it's totally doable, vbuterin is not thinking like a person that handles elections. These proceses are tightly controlled with officials.
You can do the same thing, have voting machines which use bitcoin on the backend.
You use a random wallet given with a colored satoshi to vote, you are forced to vote in a booth, before you get out of the voting place, you have to give the public address to an officer on the way out, officer doesn't know your identity, he gets to check the wallet has been emptied. When you voted, you never get to know to what address you sent your vote to as you interact with a high level interface that lets you pick candidate, and then scans your wallet QR code to send the colored satoshi to the secret candidate wallet.
100% doable.

have you tried sending them bitcoin? that one never fails.
Install the wallet, then send them a few cents and have them realize how sending cents is imposible. then show them blockchain.info in real time (with the display in USD), when you see a transaction for over 100k, tell them it's costs the same as sending the cents.
bitcoin is one of those things you gotta try.

unless you manage to create an ATM network that will issue coins which represent the fiat value 1:1 and then trade those in the distributed exchange. 
The ATM owners can make money on fees, floating the money that's statistically not withdrawn from their ATMs, forex arbitrage, etc. etc.
However, there's an onslaught of problems to solve by the proposed solution (In case they didn't jump to mind as you were reading the last sentence, here's a few: can't really deposit $100k on a ATM, or withdraw it, today's atm's barely let you get $1k/day, possible corruption from ATM owners which would end up in another fractional reserve) and you'd still need to have a massive amount of ATMs out there... if you did, most people wouldn't even think of an exchange, the exchange would be left for those of us who want to trade heavily... and we can do that with digital assets alone...
So I disagree with you that the whole idea of decentralized exchanges will be an exercise in futility, we need them to exchange digital property, there's always a chance to make money with arbitrage and speculation once you have a market, and you as an investor shouldn't care if you're making your money with Bitcoins or peanuts, you just  want to get more capital out of value winning trades.

and acceptance means usability, then you can turn a symbol into the representation of effort/action.
This is why I think building things like OpenBazaar are of most importance to the Bitcoin ecosystem. If everyone can easily exchange things/work for Bitcoin, then the bitcoin you're holding on your smartphone wallet finally becomes useful, the more people willing to ACCEPT it, the more things you will be able to do with it, and then you'll be running out of bitcoins and buying more, if that happens to more people, then the demand of bitcoin starts to become higher than the supply, and the price will inevitably rise.

I think you live in Wonderland.
The reason there is contraband is precisely because the government controls everything, from currency up to what gets in and out.
The way they've controlled everything begun with currency exchange, control the currency and you have absolute power. The government is the one stealing the most money out of this situation, they're the ones who are able to siphon the dollars they get out of China on every loan they make, on top of that, the military is deep with the contraband too, the more control, the more blackmarkets they get to make money out of.
Bitcoin means lack of control for the government, and they'll see that quickly once they see they can't stop it, issue it, or hoard it, so they will make it ilegal and call it an evil abomination of the empire. And the first thing that will happen is that your bank accounts in mercantil and other banks will be frozen.
The way Bitcoin will happen in Venezuela will be organic, it will be first out of us eventually convincing people to accept Bitcoin as a form of payment for remote work (I've managed to convince a few, but they still don't want it, they say they can't sell it, but that's slowly changing)
Then you gotta get people to start sending bitcoin to family members who are smart and in the right environment, for instance, to your cousins who are going to universities, they have the seed market that gets it, and that can afford it.
I'm trying to get a company that's setting up Bitcoin ATMs here in Miami to put a freaking ATM in Dolphin Mall, and to rally up Venezuelans that deal with buying/selling currency to hear us out about Bitcoin. All the people coming to shop here like the world is ending need to get in touch with the technology, the ATMs in Doral's malls need to have people there explaining how this can be used, how they don't need to open a bank account in Chase or Mercantil, how they don't need USD anymore.

no ponzi, just use the money you earned to buy more bitcoin when it dips again and send it back to the other exchange.
forget fiat currency.
If you need the fiat currency you can always sell it on localbitcoins.com
The issue with mtgox is that they've hit a limit of withdrawals of $3MM a day, so you will end up in a queue if you want to take the money out. This is also the reason why it's more expensive when you sell there, it's a premium you pay when buying on mtgox, however, there's a lot of volume in that exchange.
Companies are popping up to allow you to automatically do this across all the markets with volume.

The best way I can think Google can integrate Bitcoin into its experience is by:
1. Adding a Bitcoin wallet inside Google Wallet.
2. Integrate Google Wallet with Chrome out-of-the-box.
Whenever you are on a website that has a bitcoin address/payment form, Chrome would automatically kick in to let you pay with your Google Wallet.
Ideally, they'd leave the door open for Wallet developers to install wallets on your browser.
This would make payments on the web very very convenient, and you'd def. be tempted to use your Bitcoins (not just hoard them waiting for the price to go up), all of this should apply to android aswell, if Google has a Google Wallet app, there should be tight integration between Chrome for Android and the Wallet app.

compared to the competition, being able to buy bitcoin instantly 5% wouldn't be that bad (compared to coinbase.com which takes forever to give you bitcoins, unless you've ran through hoops in one leg for about a month of confirming identity in all ways possible). and if 5% were high, it'd be high just because another competitor would offer a better deal than them.

well, the big difference between bitcoin and gold, is that we've never proposed to use gold as a super convenient value exchange mechanism for day to day transfers, micropayments, etc.
So gold even if it were about to run out, it's really not as useful as a digital currency (sure it's very useful, but not for global instant electronic trading of property like bitcoin can be)
There's another cool argument I found a couple days ago, because even though I'm crazy about bitcoin, there's always a side of you that has to keep you alert... and it is the distribution of ownership of the coins at the moment. It's quite scary, and it makes you think about how easy it is to manipulate the price of bitcoin by the coin holders... of course, the wealth distribution of fiat currency in the world is just as effed up.

I think instead of 'running' on Maidsafe, what you want is an OpenBazaar compliant implementation built using the Maidsafe APIs, which I understand are a cool set of C++ APIs for building decentralized apps.
You betcha someone is going to build something like that at some point, OpenBazaar will just present the canonical implementation, the same way you have the Bitcoin Core wallet, and there's a ton of compatible wallets out there.

have you noticed if btsync uses centralized servers at any point in time? or does it purely use the DHT and the bittorrent protocol?
It's in my interest creating an open source btsync competitor this year based purely on the DHT + bittorrent. If they did it, then I have 0% uncertainty it can be done, if they're using some cloud service to perform partial uploads and rendevouz, then it's as if they cheated because the system has a centralized point of failure.

as this "sounds extremey weird to you", having the balls to wire money to Gox right now is the pay off of that opportunity.
Me, I just don't trust that company and wont' ever deal with them again, therefore guys with more balls than me will do what you're thinking off. I believe it's very likely they will enable btc withdrawals unless they're actually done with the company and not give a fuck, but my guess is they want to keep making money as an exchange.
It's very likely also, that they're using all the money they've made to buy whatever people are selling right now themselves to make people like you think about getting in, and then they'll start buying more to get that price up, once it has momentum they wait for it to go all the way, and start selling, making their money back several times over.

yes, we need an easy API to integrate bitcoin for the begginner/contractor type of web developers out there,
however, you won't ever have the "buy bitcoins with bank account|credit card" functionality.
but agreed, much necessary, and the building blocks are there.
It could be done with libbitcoin + python for instance. In fact there's already some tools out there developers are already using, but they're being built and they need volunteers to help document
Obelisk for example.
And checkout what we're doing at OpenBazaar, that's probably related to your needs.

"Nobody wants this" is a blanket statement that should be disregarded. The truth is that we're just getting started, Bitcoin before Circle was really hard to get by regular people, now that Circle is here, people need to first know about it.
There's also lots of entrepreneurs across the world dealing with regulatory issues who should be done by the end of this year and you will start seeing more and more ATMs popping up in cities world wide.
It won't be accepted everywhere in the physical world unless it's proven first on the internet. More sites on the internet will accept it as more people have Bitcoin and as more options as to how to accept and trade in Bitcoin become available, for instance, we're still building a functional OpenBazaar client, you just wait.
Pretty amazing how just "900 individuals" pumped 12 billion, imagine what millions of users will do to the value of this make believe currency.

there's just massive amounts of inneficiencies when you look at all the markets and the kind of investors currently in the market.
if you start up a fund, get yourself a team of quants, and start doing algorithmic trading across all the exchanges, which are currently unregulated there's a ton of money to be made during the next months Bruce, gotta act fast though. A lot of smart people are starting to see this and they've already built technology to do this.
Think HFS, but instead of dealing with the 13 ultra regulated markets, darkpool BS, you can do this with all the many (sub-standard) exchanges.

I think when you have $10k as the prize, you bring about tougher people to compete with and in the end, the project that wins should be of impact for the Bitcoin community as a whole, therefore the "cred" you will get out of this hackathon as a winner should be worth more than the prize itself.
If we want to raise the stakes, we need people from all over. I didn't see anything in the rules against that. (in fact I was telling the organizers, why not let people compete from the internet [distributed hackathon ;)], but then it'd be a bit harder to judge)

"i don't understand yet the concept of a wallet"
A wallet is simply a collection of keys, keys are used to sign transactions, transactions need to be signed in order to be verified such that the balance on the outgoing and incoming addresses are updated by everyone.
Bitcoin addresses are simply combinations of keys, each address is made of a public and private key combination. Your wallet just holds your own list of such address keys.
You want to protect your private keys, as they are all that's needed to sign money out of those addresses.
Bitcoin addresses (keys) are numbers so big, they're pretty much impossible to guess. It'd be like finding 2 corresponding atoms in the entire universe.

If you want to make a huge impact, and an international one, come and put one on a mall in the city of Doral, Florida.
In this city, there are LOADS of Venezuelans (and Argentinians) who live there, and also A LOT of travelers coming to the US from Venezuela with the sole purpose of spending (in the case of venezuelan) a limited amount of US Dollars approved by their government at 1/7th of the market price.
There's a huge business around the regulation of currency in Venezuela, money is given only to travellers in very limited amounts, there's crazy things going on like people traveling for 2 days, sleeping in bunkbeds (getting paid for this) just to be able to retrieve the money and make +600% profits.
Now here's the thing, if there's a place where people really need bitcoins, that's Venezuela.
The city of Doral is full of Venezuelans that send US Dollars home every month through the black market, if there were a Bitcoin ATM in one of the malls there (Dolphin Mall and International Mall) you'd have never ending lines of people buying Bitcoin so they can send to Venezuela without having to go through a black market.
This would help enourmously the goal of having Bitcoin liquidity within Venezuela. In my case, I've started paying graphic designes, coders and writers down there in Bitcoin and I connect them to local buyers, and it's working wonderfully.
ATMs in these malls would have a HUGE impact. Hope you read this.

I think you can if you prepare the right process to do it.
1. generate N random wallets private keys and deposit 1 colored satoshi into each wallet.
2. Print the wallets. Put each wallet in a certified and sealed envelope.
3. Have voters come to vote registration place, once identity is verified and that the voter hasn't come already to pick his wallet, voter gets to pick wallet envelope out of a huge pile, thus hiding the identity of the voter.
4. Voter sends colored satoshi to candidate of preference, when it's time to vote, by using voting machine, which does not ask for voter identity. Voter uses a system that doesn't let him/her know what the wallet address, this way the election cannot be monitored in real time by the media, as partial results might affect the election outcome.
5. count colored satoshis at the end of the election on the candidate's wallets.

it is related slightly, as ISPs could easily track bitcoin related traffic and slow it down, someone with huge interests of making bitcoin a pain to use could put its money and screw companies like Bitpay for instance, and then companies like Bitpay would be force to pay more for preferred bandwidth.
As for bitcoin in itself as a p2p network I'm not sure how net neutrality affects it, we already have poor upstream bandwidth as it is.

the only way would be through a network if syndicated atms owned by the bitcoin community. ownership would be established like on a public company... but there is always the human factor for corruption.
so.. if you want a pure p2p exchange the only way i see it is by the exchange of digital assets or other crypto currencies. then you move those through the p2p exchange/bid/ask/order protocol. the p2p market software is just coordinating the transactions among different blockchains. i see it like a distributed forex of digital value

there's a scenario in which NSA's SHA designed algorithm has a mathematical backdoor that allows them to forge hashes with left most bits as zeroes with a secret mathematical formula the creators embedded in the algorithm, therefore allowing them to mine blocks at any rate they want. ;) That's my greatest fear for bitcoin.
The other more plausible scenario is that NSA's computational power is 50 years ahead of commercial computing and they just decide to do a 51% attack to screw the blockchain. I wouldn't underestimate their power, our government was calculating the reaction forces of an atomic explosive reaction in the 50s and a lot of the stuff we know about computer science came from them. One of the most important battlefields is the internet, I expect them to have equal or greater power to nuclear weaponry in the computer science field, like being able to shutdown any node they please... they could pull off a 51% attack by shutting down entire bitcoin pools.

agreed, and we already have mechanisms to sign torrents.
The problem so far when working with artists is that the torrent creation process is not too friendly, so we'll be creating services so they can do so without even knowing.
After they've been validated they'll create their works on a catalog, they'll upload their files, they will be able to choose from a default crypto wallet, or a wallet specifically for that work, and then we take it from there.
The whole thing will run on top of bittorrent and crypto currencies, and it will be accessible to anybody willing to have their own version of how to present that content.
That problem is also solved by having the content creator publish the original torrents in the places where fans look for their music. People will always chose the legitimate torrent over a fake one if legitimate content is easily accesible.

After the positive feedback we got when we were asking the Bitcoin and BitTorrent communities we took the first step towards an initial integration of P2P currency, P2P File sharing and the next generation of copyright licenses for Internet content (Creative Commons)
This is a screenshot of a developer build of FrostWire on my computer.
Our next release will allow users to enter a Bitcoin wallet address, Litecoin wallet address, Paypal button page URL and any of the available Creative Commons licenses on the content shared via .torrent.
We're also creating a command line tool for site admins/programmers to create a large number of torrents via the scripting language of their chosing.
Initially we're looking to support existing free online music websites like Audio Mack, Free Music Archive, Dat Piff, so that they can create .torrents, save on bandwidth and hopefully let their users enter bitcoin addresses to accept payment directly from their listeners.
Our client will show the payment address and we will take 0% of the transaction, so much better for artists than any of the centralized music stores that take up to 30% of their sales.
(We're very aware of all the possibilities that we have ahead of us in the future by extending the bittorrent protocol if necessary, and the power of multisig transactions on the bitcoin protcol to enable seeders to monetize on their bandwith. We've actually started contributing minor patches on Bitcoin-Qt as we want to be part of Bitcoin, we know p2p and we feel Bitcoin is the most exciting thing we've had a chance to be part of since we started doing P2P filesharing development)

wait there is a way! again with the atms. the idea would be that all the existing and new bitcoin atms are compatible with the p2p exchange. you could alter your fiat balance using anu atm on that network on any fiat  the atm owner would make money by charging a deposit fee and by arbitraging on the fiat exchange rates.
some other problems i see are being able to deposit or withdraw large amounts of fiat (say $100k)

did blockchain ever ask you for your social security to fill out some tax form (1099)? if they didn't, just shhh, spend a little and HOLD! they'll be worth a lot more in less than 5 years, a hell of a lot more. fuck taxes until the IRS starts taking bitcoin as a form of tax payment.
but speaking more seriously the IRS won't be able to tax on what it doesn't know, having come here to reddit wasn't a such a good idea as there's a lot of assholes that are jealous of your winnings and will write down your bitcoin address and try to figure out your identify (based on your reddit account and whatever blockchain publishes about the contest) and will probably rat you out to the IRS so... you're very likely going to have to pay uncle sam a good portion of your bitcoin, talk to an accountant.
gotta love that unwanted business partner which never loses. i hate fucking taxes.
you should probably write down the price in dollars of the moment you got the bitcoin, I'd say that's your equivalent income tax liability, then if bitcoin happens to go up to 10k in the next year, you will have to pay capital gains on those gains as well, for now it's a smaller rate, but dumb ass people want that rate to be as high (or more) than income rate. capital gains should be illegal, to me they're double taxation.

notice in advance: there are some numbers I couldn't remember well (i was walking trying not to get killed by a car when crossing streets so bear with me), like how many grains of sand are in the planet, and how these compare to the address space of bitcoin, what I said in the video is actually small.
There can be 1.46E48+ public Bitcoin address, there's only like 7E18, that's 30 orders of magnitude more Bitcoin addresses, so way way way harder to guess an existing address, and then finding the corresponding private key.
There's huge applications I didn't mention, like the "other 6 billion" unbanked, peer to peer insurance (have satoshis represent a payment to a p2p network of insurance underwriters so that if anything happens they'll have to pay you back for your claim, bye bye centralized insurance industry, welcome to smart p2p insurance), peer to peer lending, etc.
I just hope this video helps a lot of people that might be sitting on the fence, or thinking of sitting on it a broader perspective of why Bitcoin, what it is already, and what it could mean for the future.

There's also the Mastercoin protocol.
Since I started having issues with MtGox and luckily got my BTC out in time, I've been giving this a lot of thought.
The way I see it, we could all design protocols and all sorts of solutions (OpenTX, Mastercoin, Ethereum, etc) to create a distributed Forex like exchange, the idea being handling orders that pair 2 different digital assets scalably, no need for user accounts (your orders would be signed and ready to execute or cancel once the market conditions are met for it), these orders could be for the exchange of 2 digital crypto coins, or to make it future proof, for 2 digital assets kinds, so cryptocoins, gift card balances, stock crypto-derivatives, stocks, world of warcraft money, you name it, if it's digital I bet we could get it in there.
However, the current problem the bitcoin community faces is getting the regular folks out there to exchange Fiat for Bitcoin. Even if we had a distributed exchange, something we desperately need to avoid all the issues we've seen with centralized exchanges, we'd still have a hard telling people where to exchange fiat for any crypto coin. Maybe there's already some digital asset kind you can get on say your nearby grocery store (first thing that comes to mind are gift cards), and then from there you could exchange these for any crypto available for exchange on the distributed exchange.
I've been thinking a great deal about this, "how do you distribute the fiat, you need to back the promise so that you can cash out at any time", the answer that comes to mind "Bitcoin ATMs", and then this brings another set of problems like: Possible corruption from ATM owners taking the fiat and creating a fractional reserve of their own, People figuring out a way to fool the ATMs with counterfeit bills (because this thing needs to work for all currencies), ... and then creating a crypto coin to represent each different government backed fiat currency (where do these coins come from? they're "mined" by the ATMs as you make a deposit?)..., how about people wanting to put over $100k into the exchange? you'd need to integrate with the banking system as you wouldn't realistically go into hundreds of ATMs and fill them up with cash, you'd need a bank transfer, the same way we do today with centralized exchanges.
Now... suppose that we already managed to solve all those issues with the ATMs, just having ubiquitous ATM prescense would eliminate the need for the majority of people to use exchanges for buying bitcoin, they'd just get it from ATMs or institutions dedicated to making the exchange for fiat easy. 
So what I'm saying is, if we build a great Distributed Autonomous Anonymous Exchange we should only focus on Digital assets alone, the access to fiat will be taken care of by other forces, maybe even banks will be part of it regulation permitting.

Doubt old economists would get down there and understand this, specially at the speed these projects are moving and how people are building on top of them and integrating with so many other technologies. Since this is smart money you're dealing with, programmers will find a way to slap it onto so many other products, and new products that seemed inconceivable before the blockchain, it's just a really wonderful piece of technology, the missing piece for many things we couldn't build in the past.

yes, that's one of the issues I listed, however, I rather have this trust distributed than putting all the trust on a centralized entity.
as for the order cancellation, the order has to be signed by you, and only you should be able to cancel it. So it doesn't matter if an ATM owner took out the cash, once the cash has been acknowledged as "in the system", it's the ATM owner's loss if someone comes in and vandalizes the ATM (something for which he should have insurance)
As for the ATM owner stealing cash from his own ATM, yes that's a possibility, but I doubt someone would set up an ATM and act criminally, it's a pain in the butt to get one, set it up, etc. and it would easily be denounced by users. Perhaps the protocol could include a way to flag insolvent ATMs.
If I were a developer of an App that would serve as  a client for the decentralized network, I think then it'd be a great feature to have an ATM rating system, which would be fed by user's feedback (ATM is often broken, stole my money, didn't give me cash, etc.) so before you do a deposit you can check the reputation of the ATM.

We give free stickers to our users in order to promote our brand. We think it goes a longer way than paying for clicks on ads nobody wants to see.
Anyway... in order to give more stickers, when we are low on cash we ask users to pay for the postage ($0.50)
For those of you who don't have your own business yet, this is what a chargeback means.
You try to charge your customer even a little amount of $0.50 to cover for postage, but if the customer decides to file a chargeback (say, the credit card data was stolen, like what happene on Target and being tested by online thieves massively in order to re-sell it) the business ends up losing $20 for each one of these chargebacks, and they're very hard to dispute. 
Even though it was really the fault of the credit card institution for not having tighter security, the seller takes all the risk and costs of the dispute. This is by far one of the best selling points of Bitcoins and why I think eCommece adoption will be faster than a lot of people think, with the additional upside that it will enable a whole new economy of micropayments.
It's time to switch all eCommerce to Bitcoin, the safest, most efficient, most convenient way to transact online.

why Bitcoin may sound awkward or unbelievable when compared to existing mobile payment technologies.
When compared to Apple Pay, Credit Cards, NFC, Bank clearing houses, and talked about on a public forum such as Refresh Miami, the Bitcoin expert sounded like he was a bit of an awkward fanatic (and he was being very very moderate and humble when talking about Bitcoin btw) by judging at the reactions of the crowd.
Comparing Bitcoin to the technologies used by the other members of the panel is like being in 1999 and comparing the Fax Machine to email or the internet. At that point very few people would take email/internet seriously, but these technologies moved at an exponential pace and now only government and lawyers will ask you to use fax machines.
Bitcoin is software, better yet decentralized &amp; open sourced, it can evolve at an exponential pace.
It was funny hearing the mastercard guy saying things like "people will never shop with cryptocurrency", or "I have yet to hear any solutions in the tipping space", when we are already developing decentralized marketplaces (OpenBazaar), smart contracts, and when I sent a beer via tweet to  right after he said that thanks to Bitcoin.

what he means by "normal internet" is, without having to install an app, just by using a web browser and pointing it to a web server.
OpenBazaar is basically a p2p app, so you need to install it, the same way you need to install a BitTorrent client to download torrents.
however, torrents... and openbazaar are accessed through the normal internet.
This will change in the future as entrepreneurs create services that connect to the p2p network, the same way you have torrent search engines.

we're discussing a few ways to do this, one way is letting the merchant define the listings using the fiat currency of their choice as a the base value, openbazaar can use many of the several price feeds available at the time of the transaction. there should be also a threshold of volatility the seller is willing to accept before contracts are signed.
there's also some suggestions about creating or using counterparty tokens, or alt coins pegged to fiat, I'm still not convinced on those.

And ultimately if we succeed we'll just be making Bitcoin more valuable as it will become more useful.
It's also part of the frustration that there are so many things I wish I could buy with Bitcoin that I can't buy today, we can't just sit arms crossed waiting for Amazon/eBay/Google to do something, they won't, so let's use the limited window of time before they figure it out to change the status quo and build the world where we want to live in.

everyone knows this, it's been said endlessly. And it's also missing the ability to get bitcoin easily. Unless there's ATMs or we start paying people in Bitcoin it's not happening for the unbanked, they can't go to Circle.com or Coinbase.com
This is turning into Andreas' groupie reddit. wtf.

I'm not sure if this will be a way to answer, or to end up asking more questions. But this is the way I think it works.
Let's say you have a company and need funding. You decide to fuck VCs, fuck the stock market, and convince the world wide crypto community to fund your company, to invest in your business, now the unbanked will be able to invest and you could have a chance through your passion to get them out of the cycle of poverty.
You go to CounterParty, and you think your company is currently valued... $10MM, but you want to raise just $1MM to get started, as you don't want to sell your entire company on your first round.. 
At today's price, the $10MM would value your entire company at about BTC 30k (USD 10,044,000 if 1 BTC = $334.80), and let's suppose a lot of people agree with you on that.
Then you say, that the initial price of your shares will be... about $5 each just to pick a cheap number and be more inclusive, the unbanked on the third world could at least buy 1 share from you with the hopes of selling later at a higher price.
You need to get funds of about just $1MM to get your business going for now, ... and most of all you don't want to give out all your equity.
at $5 per share, that's 200,000 shares for just the $1MM, so for the $10MM (initial full valuation) you'd issue a total of 2,000,000 shares. On your decentralized first round of funding you will try to sell the 200k shares on CounterParty, and you will keep a cool 1.8M shares for latter stages, perhaps for your decentralized IPO if this round and other rounds go well.
You announce your round of funding on date X, and you say you will only be selling 200k shares at $5 a pop, that's the same as BTC 0.01493429 per share. (but you don't mention anywhere the $5 value, you just announce your price in BTC)
So, you're expecting for people to come and buy the shares from you, there's a lot of news, you're one of the first companies to do this, and as the sell begins, sellers start putting limit orders to sell when the price gets higher, the price of your shares fluctuates IN BITCOIN, if you're lucky, and there's enough volume, you will sell all your offer before the market starts already speculating with the little coins you put in circulation.
Eventually people invested BTC 3500 in your company to buy 200k shares, now your company as a whole should be worth about USD $11,718,000.0 in capital, ... what do those 3500 BTC do for bitcoin in itself? I'm not sure, as they will be used by your company, hopefully to not cash out in fiat, but to hire people , equipments, research, PR, and hopefully use the BTC directly to pay people.
On some days your stock goes down, and with money you've made you decide to buy back some and help keep the price steady,.on others when you think it's over priced, you could get bitcoin liquidity to pay employees or research by selling some of the stock now. All these things would make the market react.
So looking at this, I believe the value is really held in the crypto shares (not on Bitcoin), and that's where there will be plenty of speculation and money to be made (and lost). My questions is then:
How can people estimate what the right price in BTC is for the shares of your company? given that BTC is so freaking volatile? can a really bad swing destroy the market cap of your company?
What would happen if the USD gained in value to the stock market? Now all of a sudden, a strong USD would mean you'd need less of it to buy the same shares of Google in Wall Street right?

1. generate N random wallets private keys and deposit 1 colored satoshi into each wallet.
2. Print the wallets. Put each wallet in a certified and sealed envelope.
3. Have voters come to vote registration place, once identity is verified and that the voter hasn't come already to pick his wallet, voter gets to pick wallet out of a huge pile, thus hiding the identity of the voter.
4. Voter sends colored satoshi to candidate of preference by using voting machine high level interface (you pick candidate, then it asks you to present private key of wallet to send bitcoin), voting machine never asks for identity of voter. Voter never knows address to where colored satoshi was sent. this way the election cannot be monitored in real time by the media, as partial results might affect the election outcome.
5. on the way out official which does not know voter identity asks for wallet, wallet is scanned to make sure it has 0 satoshis, wallet is then put back into another official envelope in case an audit needs to be made.
6. count colored satoshis at the end of the election on the candidate's wallets.

we're adding bitcoin and litecoin addresses inside the .torrent.
We're also adding a paypal address in case we can use that to generate a paypal payment form.
We're also adding a Creative Commons license, along with name of the work, name of the author and attribution URL.
We work with lots of independent artists, and we'd like to give fans a chance to name-the-price / tip artists no matter where they are in the world but only after they've downloaded and tried the music/movie/book that the content creator has made available for free under a clear Creative Commons license. 
With the creative commons license, the user can be sure he won't get in trouble for downloading, sharing, remixing and even re-selling or using the content in a commercial fashion as long as the license explicitly says so.
Bittorrent/File sharing users like to be anonymous, with Crypto coins we can provide a mechanism of tipping/payment on top of bittorrent while maintaining anonymity.
We're looking to partner with independent music stores/catalogs/labels to create a massive legal .torrent database to enable artists to share and get paid by those who want to support them, and when this happens with Bitcoin/Litecoin, artists will get to keep 100% of the money, FrostWire won't take a cent from that, we're merely a file sharing tool, there should be no intermediaries between content creators and consumers, at least that's the world we want to live in.

I think his concern with dealing with 2 parities from a user experience perspective is minuscule (and well answered by you Vitalik) compared to the problems you create for yourself when you base your asset/coin on top of XCP. 
Let alone that we have to deal with Bitcoin volatility, you also have to deal with XCP volatility (which could be a function of some black swan happening on another asset running atop XCP or just bad news related to CounterParty), counterparty forces asset creators to burn bitcoin with the excuse (that I get from everyone I ask) avoiding spam (has any one taken a look at all the squatters not being stopped by this measure?).
It just seems like a really bad idea to issue things like shares or stock on top of another imposed by the developers coin created by them. I think that just kills the deal for anyone with a common sense.

has anybody published a good restocking algorithm? it can be very complex if you think about it. You could own several ATMs, each one may have a different daily withdrawal rate, you could be purchasing Bitcoins from one or many different exchanges with your script (even try to arbitrage), there will be a time between the moment you make the purchase, until the moment the money is transfered to the wallet your ATM withdraws from and the money becomes spendable, so you don't want to withdraw too little because you might still be short, and you don't want to withdraw too much specially in a downtrend...
I guess such algorithm is nothing someone would want to share, as it's part of the zero sum game of the market if you want to run a profitable business you want to have an edge.

So, I understand my fellow venezuelans are in NYC, and they're using a new opensource exchange software that seems to be written in Python and still in its infancy called [BlinkTrade]( (just 5 committers, written in Python)
Hopefully with the low transactional volumes they have they won't have to start the rewrite anytime soon. Writing a true exchange requires in my opinion technology that allows for low latency transactions (Java/C++/specialized hardware to process a large amount of orders per second reliably, and that's just the tech side)
So let's suppose they get the capital to have the tech side solved, this part is doable, and I hope they can do it, for Venezuelans actually need this. The huge problem I see, and why I didn't even think of starting an exchange in Venezuela is the part of where you hold the Venezuelan FIAT.
The Venezuelan governement is extremely controlling of anything related to money supply. I think in a way they'll both hurt and help Bitcoin in Venezuela by trying to open an exchange.
Once the exchange starts working and people starts depositing money into this centralized piece (which in my opinion goes against what Bitcoin stands for, and all centralized exchanges eventually will dissapear as they are the major source of the fucking volatility due to short term vision speculators), it just takes a TV appearance of the president ordering these "Imperialist Fascists who are trying to wage war on the Bolivarian Currency to have their bank accounts and all assets frozen effective immediatly"
and that's it.
But then what, now everybody knows about Bitcoin, and then there will be a "debate" on the 99% Pro Government and Corrupt Assembly  to either ban bitcoin, or rule it as a currency under the same exchange laws applied to the US dollar, Euro, etc.
What that will do, will be to create awareness for Bitcoin, and then things will take the natural course I've predicted for Venezuelan Bitcoin adoption, Decentralized Adoption:
Given Venezuela's irreversible inflation tendencies, caused precisely because of their own currency exchange policies, a modest amount of liquidity that will come to the country via:
* Creative Remote Labor paid for directly in Bitcoin (Designers, Programmers, Lawyers, Writers)
* People traveling to countries with Bitcoin ATMS (We'll have some waiting for you in Miami/Doral very soon guys)
* Venezuelans with existing USD accounts opening accounts in Coinbase, Circle, and existing USD/Bitcoin exchanges.
...will make Bitcoin attractive enough as a momentary store of value, and an excellent option for capital flight in Venezuela.
So, if they don't succeed, I truly hope they stir the shit out of the media for months to come, and that in itself will be a success and we should applaud them for having the balls to even try this, as I believe they're not just at huge risk of entreprenurial failure (and I hope they pivot, or adapt and evolve), but they're putting probably their family members in Venezuela at risk by doing this.

Yes, Microtransactions are in our map, however that means deeper integration and having a wallet inside FrostWire, unless there's a way to start a microtransaction from a webpage, we could do it easily by enabling the necessary metadata in the torrent.
We wanted to take a babystep to see if we're moving in the right direction, if this is something that content creators will want and there will be a lot of experimentation.
As for donation-based model not working, that's to be seen, we wouldn't be able to say if it worked or not until we tried. So far donations support our development (our client is free), and we know plenty of friends that live under that model (Buskers, Street Circus Artists, Street Musicians), we thought the internet could act as a bigger stage for those willing to use their works as marketing collateral. Out of 250 million people, there's a lot of people who would gladly pay for content, but they just don't have the option to, now they'll be able to pay it back. We did an experiment with a Creative Commons mixtape a year ago, and it was incredible the amount of donations we got, some people even gave $20 for an album that was free.

reputation if i understand correctly from the paper is built by the proofs of burn of the network of shoppers around the shop. so if you have a buyer that did pob, that adds to your reputation. the more proven users that sucessfully transact and rate the better. the idea is to make it expensive to create fake ratings for fake trsnsactions, so you dont buy and sell from yourself to build up a bogus rep.

if you ever need to send/receive very little money, or more than $9999 to someone without getting your ass probed by the bank with ridiculous questions and wire fees, and you want the money to get to you or the other person almost instantly for little (cents) to no fees, use Bitcoin.
If you want to receive payments from people visiting your website and you don't want to go through the pain of getting a merchant account and certificates, use Bitcoin.
If you know anything about market speculation and you have some money to play with, you might want to trade Bitcoin, this is actually a good moment to buy 1/2 priced bitcoin.

NSA invented SHA algorithms. This is my one issue with Bitcoin.
Other than the NSA being able to have a mathematical backdoor in their design to re-create private keys... who's to say they (or some math wiz) won't ever find out a mathematical property to generate SHA-1 signatures that start with lots of zeros to the left. Just a mathematical quirk could make someone mine blocks at any rate, no matter the difficulty... this is one way how bitcoin could go down. let's hope I'm absolutely clueless about what I'm saying and that SHA algorithms are super super super super super hard to be tampered with.

that is part of "next steps", this will require deep integration and an possibly a deeper enhancement of the bittorrent protocol. it's something we think about a lot and to fully understand how to do it the easiest/cleanest/efficient way possible we're collaborating with the bitcoin source code, so that we can understand completely the possibilities.
one way we think this could work would be on a bidding basis, as you could get overwhelmed if you are seeding rare content. at some point the person that got the pieces from you will also want to make its money back and they will try to seed the content for a cheaper price, it will be damn interesting to code something like this.

i agree with what you think of wall st coming in and injecting real capital.
however i also elieve that bitcoin can easily grow its market cap organically without wall st. i have written an article about how the current market cap could grow in a bearish scenario a minimum of 10x simply because of bitcoin's convenience for e commerce
why bitcoin could then grow another 100x would be a function of your vision, however every time you speak to well seasoned wall st people with 2 or 3 times your experience the one word you hear coming out of their mouth is "regulation".
i think both b2c and b2b and "early" risk friendly wall st money will all act together in a positively reinforcing cycle, i think this is inevitable, the world has a lot to gain from bitcoin, and even if it fails a 10bn market cap is really nothing, im actually glad people like you are interested, ive been waiting for you guys.
it's a childish attitude some people have here towards wall st, everybody is free to use bitcoin, if anything we meed wall st's validation.

if the ATMs are directly connected to the internet, they'd be running P2P software to connect to the exchange.
The exchange, the way I see it, is made up by a series of Protocol messages which peers interchange to place orders on this huge graph. I almost see it as a search problem in which peers are constantly looking for orders that match the price points in order to be excuted. I bet this (as hard as the challenge looks like) can be decentralized as many other people have proposed.

Hope you learned not to count your chickens before they hatch from this experience. You don't announce anything nor get into any responsabilities based on uncertain information.
Very rushed on your end, after you get the ATM, it could be defective, you may need to develop custom software on it, you may need to learn about licensing, actually learn how to manage it, maybe place some infrastructure on the backend to manage replenishment, get the bitcoins at a fair market price WHEN you are ready to go, etc. etc. very very rushed way of doing business. *sigh*
LOL, you did have setup issues. I knew it. You guys just had a great lesson doing business, look at it that way, that was the cost of your $30k, you went in there very naively thinking of an ideal world. I'll read comments now to see if I'm being an asshole, or I've just had my lessons to learn too and I just find this as in big part your fault for not doing risk assessment properly.
(BTW, you have spent nothing, you should try putting an ATM in Florida, USA, you'll need at least $250k down to have a single one running [Vending mode only] and months of getting your shit together not just for the thing to work, but so that you don't end up going to jail for not doing business properly)

it won't stop the business either, think about it, say you're a famous content creator and you have a channel, and then some random 15 year old grabs the same video and puts it in his channel, which of the 2 copies of the video on the same site will get the most visits?
then the other way around.
A 15 year old unknown kid makes a cool viral video, if he properly watermarks the first copy of the video, virality is exponential and even if others re-upload, by the time the other copies become somewhat relevant, the 15 year old kid will have lots and lots of popularity on the network. Also, a famous channel would not dare and steal the content and put it up itself as they'd be liable for copyright infringment and they'd have plenty of liability on the line.
re-uploads will only help like word of mouth.

at this point we're not ready to deal with all the issues having a wallet brings, so we'll try to distance ourselves from implementing wallet functionality unless strictly necessary.
If we get to do some sort of deeper integration in which we do things like paying for preferred seeding bandwidth, then we'll think about it, but I also know that you can interact via RPC with different wallets, so we might just let you associate an existing wallet and have FrostWire speak to that wallet.
At this point in time we think it's too much responsability, we'd rather wait a little more time until people are more educated on how to handle wallets, wallet backups, private keys, etc.

If you manage to keep the costs of obtaining bitcoins abroad sell them and get the money back out of South Africa to buy more bitcoins, cheaper than that price difference you see today (and hopefully as fast as you can so you're not vulnerable to price volatility, which is probably priced in there too...), then you should be able to make some money on arbitrage. 
If there is some decent volume already, that price difference you see is already competitive as it may already include all the costs that several competitors have dealt with in order to compete and outsell each other.
If you can do it (get money out of South Africa into an international exchange [exchange rate costs + money transfer costs] -&gt; Buy Bitcoin affordably [volatility could fuck you if your transfer takes too long] -&gt; Send bitcoins back to South African exchance [miner tx fee] -&gt; Sell the Bitcoin at 1 satoshi less than the lowest seller [+exchange fee, risk of volatility fucking you up or another seller managing to lower the price much more than what you can] ), then there is money to be made... but now that you've published this here in Reddit, you've shot yourself in the foot (if you intended to make that money) as you will make that price difference less and less as you have more competitors, thus killing the chance to arbitrage yourself.
Markets are a zero sum game, don't be surprised if in a matter of days or a few weeks the price difference won't be that much.

Learn about the blockchain, signed transactions, validation, simple payment, fees, mining, wallets, bitcoin cold storage.
Once you get that, then read about how exchanges work, and it will then be clear how they're just a layer that doesn't directly depend on the blockchain (except for withdrawals and bitcoin deposits, and why that might be wrong or not, and how we could avoid another Gox-like issue)
Then you should read about alt-coins and how they differ bitcoin (and how most of them are just forks of Bitcoin with altered settings)

The hardest challenge they face is coming up and agreeing to a standard they can all offer their customers, which enables outsiders to use the platform only to make transactions, not to get mined coins.
They'd decide to add more or less coins to their "blockchain" the same way federal reserve banking works, and people wouldn't even know about Bitcoin once your local bank tells you about these new Free Digital accounts you can use for everything, and that you can just transfer balance from your checking or saving account into your digital wallets...

@_date: 2015-05-05 18:56:26
lack of liquidity. the price is unreal if there's no volume (nobody going for it), if you can't buy/sell those you can't arbitrage.
if you had a lot of people going for that price that's another story, but people will always want to buy the cheaper option, which at the moment is in the exchanges.

just checkout blockchain.info for 5 minutes, and see the transaction volume and transaction amounts. you will clearly see the advantages of something that is clearly having an exponential adoption pattern with 9 bn of capitalization. if you are truly from wall st, it will be a no brainer.
just by looking at the huge number of bitcoin exchanges, if you are truly from wall st, you dont need the advice of someone holding millions of dollars in bitcoin to realize the risk free opportunities to make a ton of money speculating as adoption ramps up and prices become less volatile.
ture wall st sharks dont need advice from redditors, you guys should know markets a hell of a lot better than that. for you BTC should be a low hanging fruit instrument while more wall st sharks dont swim in these waters

@_date: 2015-05-25 15:40:02
yeah, say you're an investment bank looking to start a Bitcoin fund, and you have a with a few million dollars to burn for your strategy.
You buy a few million in bitcoin across the span of a few months, so you have no big impact on the overall price, perhaps you do a bit of speculating for fun during that time, test how the tiny market reacts. 
Then you put a few bitcoins on different wallets (maybe hundreds of wallets), and then you have them sent money to each other, in whatever amounts, as fast as you can, you only burn bitcoin on transaction fees, until it runs out.
If you did that today at a rate of say, 20 transactions per second, you'd fill up the current block in less than 2 minutes and the rest of the transactions would be in the "memory pool". 
I've not read how the "memory pool" is implemented, if it's stored on disk, or if it actually lives on memory, if it does, you could then make a shitload of nodes fail with out of memory errors, but this is me talking about a naive attack which I hope has been covered, as I've heard description of much more elaborate and technical types of attacks.
Amidst the panick of the bitcoin blockchain not working (the one thing getting good publicity nowadays) you pay a bunch of bloggers to start scaring people into believing that Bitcoin has died this time, that the blockchain implementation wasn't the best, that the idea counts, that no transactions are going through, that the price is going down... then people start selling... then you wait until it goes as low as your quants had estimated it would go, and then you buy a shitload of bitcoin for cheap, then you have your writers team up to echo whatever is being done to fix the issues, create another positive public opinion compaign that could cost you a couple of million dollars, and hope that you actually didn't kill bitcoin, that its natural antifragile qualities kick in, the software gets patched impervious to that attack, and now you publish that you're opening an institutional Bitcoin Investment fund. ch-ching.

I could use bitcoin anyday, for instance, I tend to go out running with just my phone to track my GPS route.
Along the way it'd be nice to be able to stop and buy a drink, the same when I go to the gym, I don't take my wallet with me, just my phone to check what's next on my workout or answer any calls/make any calls in case something happens to me. Sometimes I'm hungry as fuck but I don't have paper money or credit cards on me, it'd be awesome if the Gym's cafeteria would accept Bitcoin, that way I'd be able to buy a banana or a smoothie if I'm about to pass out.
it's effing 2014 and you're still using paper dude, fucking paper.
Why if we have the internet and all these awesome mobile computers do we still need to carry around a wallet with paper money, plastic money, plastic driver licenses, all that shit can be electronic and it will be.
Why? Because you want to live in the future. Convenience.

I'd like to know how much time Warren Buffett spent studying Bitcoin to make those statements.
The more someone knows about an existing system, the harder it is for them to understand another system that makes the former obsolete. They'll try to compare it to what they know, but the truth is that he probably spent less than an hour talking to some assistants that didn't to the proper 3 to 6 months learning about Bitcoin, nor met any of the amazing people in our community, or the investors and entrepreneurs building upon it, so they really have no clue about what Bitcoin is and all the possibilities around it. This man just dissed the biggest technological advancement since the internet.
Despite what Warren Buffet thinks Bitcoin will succeed, hopefully he's not lying and is behind the scenes coming to manipulate the market with his deep pockets.

Start by installing a wallet on your phone, it's basically just installing an app, and that's it, you are a bitcoiner. No banks, no identity, just a send/receive anonymous address.
Then if you need to buy something, try buying it with bitcoin.
Get the bitcoins at coinbase.com, again, just get the amount you are about to spend, plus maybe $10 so you can also try sending money to another wallet, might be a wallet on your computer, might be a wallet of a friend, that way you will initiate someone else.
Don't get into the investment part if you don't understand much about investing, and until you learn what the bitcoin investment landscape is like, you will be nothing but fresh meat for those investing 24/7 (many with software that automates their trading)
Start as an user, try no more than $100 to get started.

in case you are abroad and your government does not sell you US dollars, or does not allow you to use your credit card except for a limit of up to $300 a year after weeks of red tape... that's why you use BTC. (this has been the reality for Venezuela for over 10 years)
In the US, it still really doesn't make any sense as we already have a very well established payment network.
Bitcoin makes all the sense in the world for the unbanked, and those that don't have credit cards, or US bank accounts. Accepting Bitcoin will basically expand the numbe of international customers you have on your ecommerce website.
Then, there's the philosophical aspect of it, we need to start paying everything in Bitcoin if possible. If you want to save in bitcoin that's another thing, but if you're going to spend $100 today on something, see if they take Bitcoin, convert the $100 to Bitcoin and spend them, learn from that experience, think of how it could be better, in the process you help the merchant keep a bit more and you will encourage him/her to promote bitcoin even more, and more Bitcoin will be in circulation.

not everybody can get into Amazon, iTunes or Netflix. To get into iTunes you usually need to pay a company that will do the submission for you, they'll charge you yearly fees for being there (if accepted) and you will have to sign a lot of stuff.
This you can do in less than 5 minutes, yourself. Put the torrent on your website, facebook, anywhere your fans come to you.
But we'll make it even easier for users to find all the legal content. That's where the next steps lie.
As for copyright, we've introduced Creative Commons licenses, so the content creator can specify exactly what can be done with the works, for example they can choose wether or not you can Remix the work, wether or not you can make Commercial Use of the work (e.g. sell it, rent it, use it on a commercial product).
No need for intermediaries. This is far more efficient.
The ultimate goal is that all this free, tippable content will exist in a distributed index which any website/music player/bittorrent client can tap into, all that content can be sindicated, and being there will be super easy.

except there's only a handful of us now, seriously, we're a really tiny community at the moment, and they have millions of customers. There's so little of us, that we can't even break the Bitcoin network because we don't even do 5 transactions per second (which is what it'd probably take to wreak havoc and have developers scrambling to raise that block limit). So they might have the advantage of creating a federated blockchain between a worldwide banking association, and then offer "Electronic Wallets" that allow all the things Bitcoin does, directly to their millions of customers in order to keep control from the Internet that hasn't been born yet.

you will have to index the blockchain's transactions, whatever the block limit is... so even if we increased the transactional volume 4x by next year and we'd need almost 4mb pre block, that's what you'd need to index anyway.
I rather have a blockchain ready to take on that, than have a blockchain that will start having issues on transactions not being able to make it to the next block.
Whatever you will have to index will be a function of transactional volume, not block size, and that depends on bitcoin adoption not the allowed limits of the network. I rather have it be ready for 20mb blocks, hell, give us the 15gb block limit we need to be able to truly compete with the banking networks.

at this point blocksize isn't holding back adoption, but the moment you have enough people in the whole world trying to use Bitcoin like we all dream, and you go to a mere 1000 tx/sec the whole thing collapses, today it can barely withstand 7 transactions/sec, it's unbelievably unscalable and sad at this point and it will explode in our face the more we keep talking about Bitcoin and convincing people to use it, let alone investing hundreds of millions of dollars on bitcoin startups, demand is coming.
Increasing blocksize will have an impact on adoption, it will allow for it, Bitcoin is a joke right now with 1MB blocks, still an experiment, and sending transactions off chain sort of defeats the whole purpose of having a decentralized  system. I want every damn coffee I buy on that blockchain.

We're barely doing 70 transactions per minute worldwide and already complaining about 1Mb blocksize.
Now think about that number again, 70 transactions in one minute, worldwide, then think how many transactions are done in an single american mall per minute, probably around half of that (or that) during peak hours.
If you still don't see how small that number is (vs how excited we're about the possibilities), next monday morning when you're drinking your coffee, think how many people are buying coffee worldwide, think of how many delis in NY, how many small little coffee shops are brewing coffee, how many starbucks worldwide are serving coffee to customers, then think coffee being sold in latin america, central america around the same time, now imagine all those transactions going over the block chain, it's gotta be in the 10s of thousands per minute, and this is just coffee.
This makes me worry about the scalability of Bitcoin, for hypergrowth to occur we'll need to handle thousands, hopefully tens of thousands of transactions per minute, and if Bitcoin will do all of the things that we dream it will do, then we'll have lots of computers wanting to transact automatically all sorts of amounts small and large at perhaps at rates over 100k tx/sec... worldwide, and even outside of this planet (dealing with Mars importers/exporters, sending money to family overthere and what not)
For now I think it's actually pretty amazing that it's worth $320 per Bitcoin, it's what you'd expect it'd be worth had you bought before the MtGox bubble of last year when it was around $180-$200... not a bad investment if you got in before the madness took it to $1200. It's pretty amazing, because only 70 transactions occur per minute in the entire world, that's NOTHING, NOTHING, yet we have Microsoft on board and hundreds of millions of dollars in investment.
Let's hope it'll be able to scale, as of now, the likes of VISA and MASTERCARD can still laugh about Bitcoin as an experiment, let's prove them wrong, let's make it easy for people to buy and sell.

This is a screenshot of google/analytics of bloghogwarts.com, a site me and friends run for a number of years now.
The site is in Spanish..., very niche content about Harry Potter... not for everybody.
So the demographics isn't that huge you'd think, however, whenever we have a couple of great articles, this is how things look in real time, we're getting about 2 to 6 readers per second here.
It's probably apples to oranges type of comparison, but I think it helps illustrate how limited we are currently being able to support a mere 2.46 transactions/sec on the blockchain
(I come to that conclusion simply by looking at blockchain.info and looking at the average tx size in bytes, around 420bytes~500bytes)
If Bitcoin just makes it in one city, or starts having as many wallet installs as some real popular software out there, oh boy are we fucked.
Just think of one hot shot pop star doing something with Bitcoin and their next album release and the whole thing will collapse.
PS: And don't come with the BS about off-chain as the solution like I was told in february when I brought this issue to the mailing list, you can't control where people will transact from, remember the blockchain is an open system.

I think the total opposite, it's only because of this that bitcoin has gotten the attention it needed, also the fact that it's deflationary it brings the greedy investors to the game, those who can afford to buy and hold for years, keeping value locked into the system.
it's a beautiful design from the human-desires point of view.

This is a mafia run government. It turns every opportunity for the people to make a living into a black market by making all activities illegal. You can't even move food from one state to another legally, they've turned food trade into a black market, they get food at subsidized prices, then they hoard it and sell it to black market distributors. It wouldn't be a surprised they wanted to do the same with Bitcoin.

to process a whooping 7 transactions per second... we so need multi gigabyte blocks and to rethink the whole thing so mining is not that expensive, as it's becoming more and more centralized due to costs, ask anyone and it doesn't make sense to mine unless you have big bucks, that sounds like centralization to me. 
326,663,538 GH/s for such a poor transactional capacity is clearly a problem that will kill Bitcoin if it truly gets adopted.

I'm pondering the possibility of putting together something in this very direction during the Miami Bitcoin Hackathon.
I don't think it could kill piracy, as the downloaded files can easily be put into another regular old .torrent which doesn't have to require for Bitcoin payments, however, I think content creators would finally have a way to monetize their content directly and it'd be a great opportunity to bring about a lot of legitimate content to the network, I believe there's more honest people in the world than not, and given the choice, people will do the right thing.
Maybe I can use the opportunity to get your thoughts on some of the questions I have on how to go about it.
Let's imagine for a second how the process would be with an existing BitTorrent client like FrostWire (the one I contribute to)
Some director or musician has a movie/album they want to share on the BitTorrent network in exchange for Bitcoins.
Right now on FrostWire you can specify cryptocurrency addresses where users can send donations, but now we'll have a checkbox there that says "[x] Paid torrent (share only with users that have paid for this content)" and then I envision another field that would allow the user to setup a percentage to share revenues with seeders helping deliver the content.
If Paid torrent has been enabled, then the user can set the price of the content and peg it to a fiat currency of choosing, every other torrent client will be able to fetch the market price of Bitcoins using a standarized service, say 
All good so far...
Let's suppose for a second that once the torrent got created it gets published automatically to a distributed index which is picked up by every other torrent indexing website out there. And the content creator starts seeding with this torrent client that will only share torrent pieces with other clients that pay.
At this point I believe what happens could be along these lines for the downloading side.
Some user in some other country has this same torrent client, he has already setup a Bitcoin wallet, he's funded the wallet with about USD $10 in Bitcoin, he performs a search and he sees some search results, and then there's this one fresh result which shows as a paid torrent. Since he has setup his client to work by default in USD, he'll see the price of the torrent in USD and in parenthesis the current price in BTC.
At this point, there's only one seed, the original one (and there might be other people about to make the same decision if the content creator is actively promoting the .torrent, or if it makes it to the news, think... 50 cent is releasing an album on a paid torrent)
The user starts the download and is asked to enter the password protecting the private key, the torrent client gets the .torrent, sees that there are 145 pieces, and by the time the transfer is about to start, after scraping the tracker it realizes there's already 20 seeds.
The .torrent also says that it's been configured to share 5% of the payment with seeders.
IDEALLY, at this point the client could setup a series of Bitcoin transactions with inputs and outputs corresponding to the address of the content creator with 95% of the payment per piece and 5% to the seeders, when handshaking with seeders we could ask them for their addresses but here's where my nightmares begin:
When are payments sent? 
After pieces are received?  
I think it's a no-no sending the payment before hand as the seeder might get disconnected. 
At the same time the seeder risks sending a piece and having the client not pay for it, so you start thinking of multisig for escrow, but who the hell can be picked as escrow (you want to keep it distributed, but it's also risky to be an escrow as you could be an accomplice for criminal copyright infringement, there will always be morons trying to make money off of pirated content)
Maybe there could be a mechanism upon which a seeder could challenge the downloader if he doesn't get paid for the piece sent, letting all the other seeders to not send any data unless a signed transaction is on the blockchain for the piece that was sent. 
I read the transaction output script supports an OP_RETURN operation that has 40 bytes available which can be used for metadata. If there's another way to add metadata to the transaction, please let me know, as I think the following information would be pretty useful to have, for quick verification, and also for looking up transactions quickly related to downloaders and specific torrents they may have paid for in the past.
torrent_info_hash : 20 bytes.
piece_sha1 : 20 bytes.
With these 2 pieces of information, along with the transaction information (seeder's btc address), and the fact the transaction is signed by the downloader, peers in the swarm could verify the piece has been paid for, at this point I have a big issue to solve, which is, how do we know the user didn't pay himself and he's pretending to be a seeder... should 100% of payments be sent to content owner's address, is there a way to maybe do this with multisignature addresses?
Now, a torrent may have hundreds of pieces, so imagine the number of transactions burdening the blockchain, there will be many cases upon which (to save space on the blockchain) you might want to group several piece payments into a single transaction... so many questions that could be answered by a Bitcoin expert.
I also think that if a user has already paid for a torrent once, he should be able to download the file over and over as long as he can prove with his bitcoin signature that a piece has already been paid for, in this case, the seeders would have to be altruistic and serve pieces that have already been paid for to others.
So those are my thoughts so far. would love some feedback, might be able to put something like this together during the hackathon if the process can be simplified.

here's an example as how things are getting out of hand. I believe in 2015 people will start killing each other for food, and it's already starting to happen here and there.
This happened in what's considered a pretty good area to live in Caracas, Cumbres de Curumo, a stamp of people got to a supermarket and they stepped on a woman, they stole her food in the process. She had powder milk, meanwhile some people laughed about the woman being stamped on. 
Society is just destroyed over there man, and it's only going to get worse.
To give you an economic outlook.
The country is about to default, wallstreet is giving it a 98% chance of default.
The country imports about 95% of what it consumes, and only government officials are the ones that can actually import anything, it's a mafia.
How will this country that depends on imports be able to get more USD to import anything with an oil barrel at $48 (and going towards 20s according to the saudis), they have managed to get everyone with half a brain out, the oil industry isn't capable anymore of adjusting oil production levels like in the past.
Analysts expect hyperinflation of 1000% this year, not only people will not be able to afford bread, but there won't be any bread to buy. McDonald's doesn't even have potatoes to make french fries anymore, and even Cuba which was sucking on the Venezuelan tittie decided to bow down to the US recently. The outlook is not good.
I already lost my grandfather last november, he died because we couldn't find a single hospital in all of Caracas that would give him treatment with a dialysis machine. So I strongly advice you not to go, so you don't end up like this:
 (she went to visit family, bam, killed)
 (just now in december)
If you go there, you should fear not just crimnals but also the police which is highly corrupt, underpaid and uneducated, several friends have horror stories trying to leave the country how they have been taken hostage by the immigration police which extorts them for US dollars, it's really crazy there man. don't go.

and most torrents have multiple files. We're looking at this for music sales, you can have full albums in torrents, singles. Also books, magazines, you name it.
You will always be looking at multiple pieces, and more downloaders than seeders, although the economics of revenue sharing by the content creator towards seeders could change that and the available upstream bandwidth would be increased.
At this point I just hope the Micropayment negotiation won't slow down the transfer too much.
At some point I was thinking of sending all the chunks encrypted at once, and then deliver a list of encryption keys as part of the bitcoin negotiation.

how do you hash 29,000 books and "put them in the blockchain"?
1. Create a torrent of the 29,000 guttenberg project books.
2. Grab the torrent's infohash, put it in the OP_RETURN of a bitcoin transaction. Make sure to add some BTCs for miner's fees so you don't spam the blockchain.
Bam, you have a factom.
3. Optionally seed the torrent and get others to seed... to guarantee the books won't ever be lost. Factom has nothing to do with this part, they want to let you sort out the storage aspects, so Bittorrent seems like a good solution as long as there are interested parties to seed.
Please someone tell me how this factom stuff is any different, maybe I'm missing a lot here.

Obviously piracy is impossible to solve, this is not what I'm trying to solve.
I'm just trying to provide a way to sell content so that those people who are honest, and who I believe are the majority out there have a way to do so using Bittorrent and Bitcoin, that's all. Yes, it's super obvious that you can just create another torrent and start pirating, that's not my target market in this case. Those who want to pirate are not lost sales and will most likely keep pirating until they can afford the content. I think that if the cost of the content is right, those pirates will turn into paying customers and do the right thing.
As things are, content creators can't sell over Bitcoin/BiTorrent and get paid directly. The closest thing is a hacked tracker/torrent BitTorrent Inc put together but it depends on credit cards, which limits tremendously the possibility for people abroad to pay for content.
I believe the majority of people in the world if given the choice will stay within the law, as of now BitTorrent only gives that chance for Creative Commons and Public Domain content, but nothing for paid content. Let's change that!
@_date: 2015-01-09 22:02:42
the point of it is for legal use. If you are a musician or writer or film maker, nowadays you have no choice but to split your earnings with all sorts of third parties.
The idea is to make Bitcoin another channel for legal content distribution, not to end piracy, which is impossible to end.
Those who will pirate, will keep on pirating, those who want to do the right thing will paid for the legitimate content on the network, which the market will surely dictate as a lot cheaper.
If a great implementation comes along, I'm sure many artists will prefer to have control over their content and get paid directly. Again this will not end piracy, but it will surely combat it as people worldwide would have a way to pay for content that creators want sold, no matter when.
The content creator could chose what percentage of the cost per piece shared would be split between her and the seeder, as well as a small portion for miners to include the thousands and thousands of transactions to the blockchain, per torrent, per downloader.

They're starting to say already that Bitcoin is sold at a price which is paired to the black market USD price (like everything not sold by the government which has ridiculous price controls that create black markets of everything), they'll also get them because they didn't have any "import certificates" for the mining equipment, so they'd be considered smuggled goods.

hopefully he/they'll make this happen. If bitcoin ever happens and we can't support 100k transactions per minute, this is going to fail majorly. People trying to pay for things world wide and transactions not getting included on the blockchain due to high traffic, because of block size limit?

Let's focus on adoption, adoption, adoption, then Bitcoin will be worth something as the more you can buy with it, the more useful it becomes, the more people will need to buy and speculators won't have enough clout to fuck with the market anymore.

For truly decentralized exchanges with FIAT support we first need Bitcoin ATMs worldwide and then having all the operators install a standarized decentralized exchange software.
All ATMs could be part of a decentralized network which allows people to deposit fiat (would not be viable though for people looking to trade amounts over 10k, like those with tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands or million dollar funds)
Otherwise a decentralized exchange would only work for digital goods/currencies only.

We need to enable everyone in the world to sell things, when more things are available for sale on Bitcoin then you have more incentive to use Bitcoin, then you need more bitcoin, then Bitcoin becomes scarce and price starts to go up and stabilize as no speculator can compete with millions of people using the coins to buy/sell things conveniently.

sadly the dude in the right was right.
it's nothing more than a speculative asset at this point, most people here don't actually use Bitcoin, perhaps once a month, the rest is just holding thinking they will be rich, the others are speculating on the volatility, if we started actually using it it would collapse.
He's right, people are still pricing in fiat because pricing in Bitcoins is ridiculous, you just can't with the volatility.
300k tx/day is still peanuts in terms of real world transactions and the blocks are already full. Core team in denial.
The only way it can go forward is when the price is so stable that you don't need a savings account any more, and for that to happen you need a massive amount of people actually buying and selling Bitcoin, something which can't possibly happen when you can only allow a mere 1Mb worth of transactions every 10 minutes.
Can't wait for other altcoins to finally explode and scale bitcoin out of the market.
Bitcoin is still alive because of greed, but there's really nothing fundamental that justifies the current price.

The LN network is brilliant, and It's debatable what the effects will be on on-chain settlement fees when you start having very little blocks (since people would be transacting on LN alone)
As Bitcoin is, it cannot scale, it needs a major redesign of how transactions are stored. Segregated Witness and blocksize limit raising will only give us a bit of time to figure these things out.
I'm hopeful though we'll have exponential networking speed available very soon, and even more channels to move data through (think 10s or 100s of gigabits per second), however, more people means more transactions that have to be replicated on every node, it's a scalability race between the current data structure and networking hardware (as well as the CPU capabilities to process so many transactions)
There's pretty amazing proposals though, Bitcoin-NG with its microblocks could help with moving data faster, getting faster confirmations, but still exponential in size.
I'm sure the human creativity will find a way, not sure about our ability to reach human consensus on what to do. Not always the best technology wins, think about Ethernet, it's a piece of shit that every packet that goes through your computer locks out every other packet in transit at that time, but market pressure and massive adoption made it work out.
So in the end it's a race vs the banks, who will provide the next generation of financial tools, the Bitcoin community, or the banks which have trillions to lose, billions to gain and who can steal the ideas.
@_date: 2016-03-09 21:50:47
I'm on the side of Bitcoin used as a currency, but maybe core developers figured out a long time ago that it's impossible to make it scale for such purpose, therefore they're pushing to just use the blockchain as that settlement layer, maybe they know that Bitcoin as a currency has already failed and it has no future.
The take away, the trillion dollar idea is the blockchain, and a blockchain doesn't necessarily need to reach consensus based on proof of work, this is just particular to the Bitcoin experiment, which is failing as a currency, and probably will never be a widespread currency given what we've seen unfold this past year.
Proof of work is there so that we can all trust on those new minted coins, but as far as I know, there's no mathematical proof that "Proof of work" is bullet proof. There's already papers on how to do it 30% more efficiently, and if something like Riemann's Hypothesis were proved/solved, it'd be a matter of time until someone would game the nonce generation, and then what does your "proof of work" proof?
Banks have probably realized by now that you can get rid of miners and simply sign new tokens in and out of blockchains, tokens which are backed by fiat holdings, the same way they can move money from your checking into physical fiat when you do a withdrawal in an ATM. When this happens, you have fiat on a blockchain, you don't have price volatility on the token, and you don't need to waste so much energy performing sha256 hashes into the void worldwide. Only a handful of libertarians would still use bitcoin, meanwhile the rest of the world which still believes in fiat would adopt this new amazing technology that would let them transact like never before, and when you tell them about Bitcoin they won't see the need for it.
Maybe the core developers have figured out this end game, and they think their best bet is to keep Bitcoin alive for as long as possible until people figure out the tokens are worth nothing.
So much to unfold.

If I had to guess, I think Bitcoin needs to prove itself and gain people's trust by becoming first the currency of the internet, once accepted everywhere online then it can make it to the streets, before that happens, I've a feeling that there will be a lot of automated transactions going on by Bitcoin-paid APIs, think Internet of Things, think p2p marketplaces for files (p2p itunes) or goods (p2p amazon) which won't settle off-chain as they need to be fully decentralized.
I'm so worried Bitcoin actually gets popular too soon it will fail.
Another way to look at it, remember this is supposed to be a worldwide network:
(with a 250 byte transaction, I've just read here that the number has gone to 500 bytes, so it could be half of this)
1Mb block - 7 transactions/sec
10Mb block - 70 transactions/sec
20Mb block - 140 transactions/sec
100Mb block - 700 transactions/sec
1GB block - 7000 transactions/sec
10GB block - 70,000 transactions/sec &lt;&lt; now we're talking. People world wide buying coffee, cigarrettes, vending machines, money sending to one another, paying for meals, gas, the normal stuff.
For automated computing we'll probably have to go order of magnitude up. Will Moore's law for storage, processing and networking be there for us? is Bitcoin way ahead of its time?
If we don't find a way to figure out scalability any time soon, Bitcoin in practice won't ever get out of the experimental phase, and any true attempt of mainstream adoption will make it collapse.

The prices don't make sense because you're using the fantasy based conversion rate by the government.
Here's the real Bitcoin price based on the ACTUAL dollar price.
To get dollars at the fantasy price you have to go through a lot of bureocracy and you will only get a few hundred dollars a year. It's only the people with ties to the government who are able to extract thousands of dollars at a cheap rate which can then go on the black market and sell for a profit of incredible proportions.
Entire fortunes have been made (and invested in the US) this way, which has lead the country to total collapse, and at the same time, controlling the population. All production means have been destroyed and the country depends on imports.
Currently they have barely any USD reserves left and the government on the brink of default just managed to land a 20 billion dollar loan from the Chinese.
As for considering going, you're insane if you want to go there. truly insane. If you don't get robbed, kidnapped or killed getting out of the airport, you better not get sick as you won't be able to even find basic medicines like ibuprofen.

here's your counter-idea a bit more fleshed out 
You want to create incentives for the sharing of the legal file instead, you do that by sharing the cake with seeders.
If they know they will make money by helping you, If they act rationally they will be detered from creating a free torrent out of the downloaded content as they'll want to make the money back from the purchase.
You also do need to compensate distributors as you as the content owner will probably not have enough upstream bandwidth to share the file.
Since you will probably end up doing lots of transactions, say you're downloading a paid torrent from 48 seeds, just one torrent alone and one downloader would end up creating 48 transactions on the blockchain, so you also need to leave some money for miners as this will increase the daily transaction rate exponentially.
The torrent, I believe, should specify a revenue share.  A percentage for you the content owner, a percentage for seeders and a tiny percentage for bitcoin miner transactions fees to not ditch the thousands and thousands of daily bittorrent transactions coming in.
You would start the download, your client would start the transfer only if you have enough balance to perform the download. Your torrent client negotiates with all the possible seeds the piece transfers, and once you finish downloading your LEGAL and paid for content, you can chose to become another seeder and get paid for contributing bandwidth. I'm sure most people will start seeding to get some of their money back. The uptime on the bittorrent network for paid files would be amazing.

Inspired by the OpenBazaar project we'll be 
hacking an existing full featured e-commerce solution
to create a decentralized marketplace. 
 
Bitcoin integration will be done using Bitpay, meaning store owners 
are not anonymous and will list legal products only.
 
All the stores will make a server-based p2p network, on which nodes
collaborate to provide product indexing and search.
 
With this approach buyers only need a web browser and a bitcoin wallet.

I want to enable content creators to distribute paid content via BitTorrent and get paid without intermediaries using Bitcoin. BitTorrent and Bitcoin could enable content creators of all walks of life to monetize 100% of their content, to not be censored. Content publishing should be as easy as publishing, and content creators who want to get paid should not need to split huge percentages with the distributors when content distribution can be done almost for free with technologies that have been here for well over a decade. Bitcoin I'm sure is the missing piece to bring affordable legal content worldwide.
In this video I explain part of the process I envision, and where things start to get messy. Perhaps there's a mechanism in Bitcoin, or a clever way to use multisig transactions, or functions of the output scripting language to let two parties exchange digital goods on the blockchain once something can be proven.
As of now, FrostWire allows content creators to specify bittorrent donation addresses, now I want to let them mark torrents as paid torrents and specify:
- The content owners's payment Bitcoin address.
- A revenue share split for each piece delivered which would be allocated to: Content Creator, Seeder, Miner. A suggested split could be: 95% to Content Creator, 4% to Seeder, 1% to miner fees processing the Bitcoin transactions. (I foresee a lot of transactions ocurring if this were to occur, as of January 2015, the Blockchain is doing about 70 transactions per minute and people are already complaining about Blockchain blocks being too big, If BitTorrent came into the equation I'm afraid the number of transactions per minute could jump exponentially, specially if some famous artist decides to gives this a try one day)
My problem lies on how to make a safe exchange of Data and Bitcoins.
So far I know/think that the seeder should deliver the pieces encrypted to the downloader requesting them, and at some point, once it receives the payment for the piece, it could deliver the encryption private key so that the downloader can decrypt the data given and check the integrity of it against the SHA1 of the piece as specified by the .torrent file. If I had a third party escrow in the process, this would be done easily, but the process needs to be automated, and hopefully without the need for an escrow.
I wonder if there's a clever way to create a multisig transaction between the two parties alone, or if there's some command on the output script language that could allow me to deliver the encryption keys/bitcoin rightfully. To somehow guarantee the seeder that the money will be there, and to somehow let the downloader verify the piece given has the expected data.

For those lost, like me when I opened the link (from their [wiki](
**What is SuperNET?**
SuperNET is a group of people who work on blockchain technology. SuperNET released and will release several applications to make the usage of cryptocurrencies and the blockchain in general easier.
**What is Iguana?**
Iguana serves as a unified codebase for all of SuperNET's myriad services. In the foreseeable future, the Iguana platform's services will run in a Chrome app or natively via Linux, Windows (both 32-bit and 64-bit), OSX, Android and iOS. 
As envisioned by SuperNET lead developer JL777, Iguana will become "a one-click chrome app. It talks direct to the coin networks as a full peer. It is a polyglot client. Same code for BTC and all compatibles. Using native ramchains. 
This will allow direct integration of Pangea, Instantdex, Peggy, etc., without any reliance on public nodes for anything.”
Ramchains are a customized and distilled database a given blockchain that allows to query information in a much faster way. Developed by jl777, it runs mostly on RAM, and as such is exponentially faster when doing blockchain related processes. It is also half to a third of the regular size of a given blockchain. The process by which Ramchains are made only applies to first generation crypto-currencies, or Bitcoin clones, and BitcoinDark must be also installed for Ramchains to work in their current state.

I managed to escape and I'm never going back, I'm desperate to take my family out of there. I'm a software developer. I wish nothing but to bring Bitcoin to my country but it must be done in stages. 
First stage is educating people and getting intellectual workers to accept Bitcoin.
That's why I translated the Satoshi Paper to spanish (my translation is currently available on Bitcoin.org) and I've started diariobitcoin.com to keep people informed about Bitcoin in spanish.
Then people need tools to deal with the pricing, that's why I built the interactive calculator at 
I currently pay bloggers and musicians via Bitcoin, but they quickly get turned off as they can't sell it as easy as one would wish.
When you have to spend so much time doing lines just to get basic things like food, medicine, it's very hard to think of cryptocurrencies as the solution.
Eventually some people will make money mining (using stolen electricity) and the word will come out, but we need more people to send bitcoin first, there's a lot of venezuelans in Miami. I'm trying to convince a bitcoin atm company to put a bitcoin ATM in the Dolphin Mall in Doral (Miami) where most Venezuelans go shopping to (those that can travel to exchange the cheap dollars) as well as the huge venezuelan community that lives in the area.
So first education, then liquidity, which can be established also by sending remittances there... but the situation there is just a complete chaos, it's hard to even begin to describe all of the things that are wrong.

from what I could tell... this sounds like vaporware or investor-dickpotting by using what seems something complex and over their heads, but in reality this is something that could probably be done for free using a real DHT implementation like libtorrent's, working already (running on over 10 million nodes), proven to scale and resistant to all sorts of attacks over the years...
I asked someone in the boot how this worked, and he said it was basically a DHT on which you pay to post up to 10k of information.
He said the need to pay was to deter spam...
I asked him about specific implementation details of the DHT, as for instance, the libtorrent DHT can only store up to 1000 bytes per put given it works using UDP Packets, and he said they didn't have a DHT implementation yet...
and then I ask myself if this is another one of those projects that somehow raises money to put an image like they're going to solve all of the worlds problems, and go to conferences talking about their crowdsale and sucker a lot of people in...
If all you're putting is the hash of a document, or the hash of a hashtree, why in the world do you need to make pompous presentations and ask for people's money to do this, seems like this can be already done on OP_RETURN with Bitcoin as it is on any transaction or submitting a BIP for a new operation that allows to store hashes on the transaction script if a certain amount of miner fee has been included in the inputs.

let's hope not. I've more trust on a ON-CHAIN solution based on the combination of:
 * Thin blocks (don't send the blocks, send a merkle tree so I can re-assemble the block with what I have on the mempool, If I'm missing transactions then I can ask for them)
 * Segregated Witness (make block usage optimal, fix transaction malleability)
 * BitTorrent Swarm style network propagation (We shouldn't be doing a dumb broadcast, we should play it smart like battle tested BitTorrent swarms which move petabytes a day to MILLIONS of clients, 1Mb... please)
 * Blocks as big as necessary to keep confirmation times under 4 hours. Dynamic blocksize limit. (Take over visa, mastercard, amex and everybody else combined, only when it's accepted as a form of payment by everybody price begins to become stable, then it becomes a serious reserve currency, then nobody needs banks accounts, even bigger blocks necessary, you'll need huge 15Gb+ blocks)
It'll take them a while to figure something similar to this and agree, otherwise the competition will take over, and you will be able to buy whatever you want ON chain, no poor people excluded.
LN seems like an over complicated solution which kills the incentive of mining blocks as the reward is diminished. As time moves forward you want bigger blocks so you can get more in transaction fees, affordable transaction fees for all.
Give me gigabyte sized blocks in the 2020s.

I'm sure networks will get hella fast, and we'll be able to move 20Mb blocks no problem, this alone will help us take over VISA's current transactional volume.
The goal will be to scale 100x beyond that, as a network with Bitcoin's characteristics will create way more transactional volume.
This is often what happens when you have a tecnological breakthrough, economies of scale happen. If you build it they will come sort of thing. If you let people transact cheaply, they'll transact waaaaay more, and that's what we need to achieve.

even if it ran as you wish, if the store wasn't censorable because it's replicated elsewhere on the network, this doesn't serve shit because someone still has to send you the products. So no biggie on that.
Eventually media storage will be replicated with something like IPFS (or IPFS), but this will only help with the shopping experience to be a bit faster, less laggy, maybe even help the store owner run redundant nodes.

Most likely you'll realize that it's unsustainable and that the market would probably not be able to afford the energy cost.
We'll see this as miners go away with the block rewards if Bitcoin can't scale to let enough people use it.
A currency that can only be used by a handful of people, with no intrinsic value, will just be a highly speculative asset until it can fool the speculators it has any value. Meanwhile, the Banks have figured out the genius behind Bitcoin is the idea of the blockchain, and that proof of work as the source of trust is simply a replaceable component of a blockchain.
It'd be real interesting if anybody can actually come up with this number, the unsustainable total amount of energy wasted by the rest of the network to create the next block, let's say all that hash power right now would equate to USD $1MM every 10 minutes, would you pay $40k for a single bitcoin on march 2016?

Stop drinking the koolaid. Fight for scalability if you want it to be a good currency. For now just a value transit network with awesome speculative opportunities.

Still not even 100 transactions per minute on average (only 73 transactions per minute worldwide, a single american mall probably does more than that during a weekend).
We're still alpha testing this thing.
Early days.
Can't wait for 100k transactions per minute. (OpenBazaar, BitTorrent + Bitcoin, All Deli's in major cities selling coffee between 8 to 10am...)

1Mb blocks for a handful of people to be able to transact, that's very decentralized.
Bitcoin for all, p2p electronic cash, permission-less ability to transact. This network already can do easily 10x the blocksize we have now, look at the size of the mempool already, transactions are getting broadcasted world wide no problem, and the internet is only getting exponentially faster with gigabit isps and 100gigabit ethernet in the cloud.
Had satoshi made the blocksize a dynamic function based on median confirmation times and the median size of the mempool in time, we wouldn't be having these debates and already getting massive adoption because bigger companies would've considered the system seriously, but nobody in their right mind will accept bitcoin if it only supports a maximum of 5mm transactions a day in the best case scenario, that's just laughable.
Nobody complains about difficulty increases, nobody complains about not being able to afford more hash power, and now having this artificial limit in the equation has created precisely the opposite of the decentralized spirit.
It's a no brainer these parameters need to be adaptable to the demands of the network. Nobody would be fighting this much if this had been left up to the code, just like the Chinese figured out how to own so much hash power, they would've worked around any bandwidth issues.

@_date: 2016-01-17 02:12:55
I agree, different beasts in that sense. But the truth is that in today's world, so much works that way and most people are still asleep.
It'd be great if we could have a truly scalable decentralized and take over their world.
To take over their world the price of Bitcoin needs to be stable, for that to happen the market needs to be significantly larger, if you can barely support 500k transactions a day, it will remain an experiment. Let's go beyond 15MM, 30MM tx/day and then the Bitcoin market will grow enough that it'll be much harder to manipulate.
Then Bitcoin becomes a store of value, then you can take the money out of the bank and safely keep it in your wallets, then more and more people wake up, and it doesn't matter if they build their blockchain, we would serve both purposes, and they could never serve ours.

Their Bank, Banesco, notified them their account would be closed.
The exchange says operations in Bolivars (the local fiat currency) will be suspended for about two weeks, and they strongly recommend all their users to withdraw their Bolivars back to their accounts.
Interesting situation from a market perspective as some users might want to cash out in Bitcoin scared that their own accounts might be shutdown by the government (as I don't expect that there's any financial privacy in there anymore as the government and powerful corrupt politicians bought banks left and right), while others might think of selling out all their bitcoin and cash out in Bolivares because they might need the money.
EDIT: SurBitcoin users only have until today, Friday Feb. 3rd 2017 to withdraw their Bolivars. I guess that will kill liquidity and whatever Bitcoin remains from Venezuelan users will flee the exchange. Let's see if this company will be antifragile enough to survive this hit.

they will allow permissionless transactions with bounds, the bounds impossed by existing financial regulations.
They could let you transfer even millions of dollars, the same way you can transfer millions of dollars via wire transfers today, but you already being a registered wallet with an identity in your system your transaction will raise some flags and you'll be monitored and stopped if needed, but not necessarily.
With a blockchain they can cut those regulatory costs enourmously.
And if you happen to be doing money laundering or very illegal stuff they can always rollback your transactions and end you.

Valid points but only a matter of time.
We can make Bitcoin wallets part of your browser and make payments easier than PayPal.
Adoption of Bitcoin will be much faster than you think as getting a wallet is as easy as installing an app. No banks, credit cards to associate, no country/ currency limitations for the billions of people outside the us.
PayPal just won't be able to compete toe to toe with Bitcoin.
It won't cease to exist as it is a huge online bank with millions of customers and it is already integrated into millions of ecommerce websites, but as Bitcoin catches on, given all its benefits PayPal will start experiencing some considerable churn and slower customer growth.
PayPal as an online money transmitter on the other hand, given that it has customers fiat floating, can serve as THE Bitcoin multisignature escrow to let people buy and sell Bitcoin online. And take commission from all that activity. This could go against their current business model as it creates liquidity and ease of access on the Bitcoin network, so they gotta figure out how else they can survive... perhaps offering their own Bitcoin wallets, security know-how, insurance, etc.

@_date: 2016-01-24 18:00:09
actually not, those are cycles wasted on random numbers and possible versions of a block that will never make it. Only a tiny portion is being used to verify transactions because there's so few of them.
It'd be better if a lot of that hashing power were used to index and verify transactions in a smarter way. On every other p2p network, more resources means more scalability. Not on this one.
The problem is that eventually this model isn't sustainable if the network won't have enough value to justify the energy expenditure, it's simple logic.
@_date: 2016-01-17 02:04:10
this will only happen if we have scale. If we remain small, Bitcoin's market will be easy to manipulate, you won't be able to do that until we can scale.

the ETF would've been great because the more people participating in Bitcoin would've meant the Bitcoin price would've been harder to manipulate and price stability would've come sooner (then Bitcoin could be a viable option for free savings accounts worldwide, then it becomes a real currency), not to mention bigger pockets and incredible development talent currently outside the Bitcoin development team. It's a fallacy to believe the best developers in the world are in Bitcoin right now, there's only a handful of them coding Bitcoin while probability tells us a lot more brilliant people are currently paid to do really amazing things in other markets (e.g. High Speed trading quants could've been funded to come and make Bitcoin a hell of a lot better)
Those who wanted to hold real bitcoins and their own keys are always free to do so, the ETF wouldn't have stopped anybody from doing that, so that's not really an argument.
Huge capital would've brought real pressure to make Bitcoin a mainstream financial network, I'm afraid that without this kind of "adult supervision", we'll be plagued with market whales eating the poor guys that have no clue about investment risks and market manipulation and we won't get out of the consensus hell we've been for like 3 years now, time is running out, the network effect isn't that great if you look at what's happening in the dark web with monero and dash, people are already using these currencies because they're affordable to transact on, that's my 2 cents.

I think you don't know about how the mempool works, and how you don't have to send the entire blocks after they've been found.
You see, all nodes are getting unconfirmed transactions almost in real time, these are waiting to be merged onto the next block a miner will announce.
When a miner finds a block, all he has to do, is build a merkle tree of the block he just put together and send it along with the block header.
Every node can use the merkle tree, which is way way way smaller, regardless of the blocksize, along with just a portion of the transaction ids (transaction id prefixes), to recreate the blocks locally, if you have collisions or you're missing transactions on your mempool you can ask your neighboors. End of the problem, there's no propagation argument.
You can also optimize this process by creating a merkle .torrent whose chunks are made to match the transaction id prefixes, and then use the robust, scalable and battle tested bittorrent protocol to distribute the torrent chunks efficiently.
The problem is human, it's not technological, plenty of solutions are available, and we can have huge blocks. There's just people interested in centralizing transactions so they can make money on fees.

the thing is that you can't have a SoV until you have scale.
While Bitcoin remains small, its market will remain small and its worth easy to manipulate, like what just happened with a post, a NYT article and a significant BTC dump.
That's not a good SoV in practice.
Have it scale and it will be waaay harder to manipulate, then you are free to use it as SoV if you like, no need for bank accounts, but that'll never happen unless everyone is willing to accept it, something impossible without scalability.
Networking technology will be here soon to let us support blocks beyond 20Mb, that's my only hope at this point.

You need to think about how many transactions you can fit in 10 minutes, barely 4500~5000.
This is an OPEN, World Wide, financial network.
Meaning, you can't stop any one from transacting whenever the hell they want (remittances, paying employees [what will happen around the beginning of the months when everyone is getting paid?], doing international trade, speculation and arbitration on exchanges, coffee shops, etc. etc.).
4500 transactions is nothing if you imagine all the money that is already moving and that will move this year on Bitcoin.
Just the equivalent of a couple Costcos and Wallmarts, a few hundred delis in NYC would make it collapse. Now add to that what happens if people start actually buying and selling things on OpenBazaar once it comes out, all transactions there will be onchain, and the world is super thirsty for this, specially outside the bubble you live in, where people have no credit cards but boy oh boy they like to spend money and they haven't experienced what it's like to have amazon or ebay.

I want to see what you will do when 2Mb blocks start to pop out with cheap fees, then BTU starts trading on exchanges initially for pennies, but big whales and sane investors could decide to exit _temporarily_ out of BTC to see how things play out and then decide where to purchase. Professional investors with the biggest capital in the market are not fanatic Hodlers.
Such sell out would trigger a panic and a massive BTC price crash could come. 
The price is still around $1000, a good time for many people to make real profits before the madness unfolds.
With the likes of Roger Ver selling a ton of coins BTC could drop, he might then try to pump BTU and it might actually have a chance once people see they don't have to wait 4 hours for a confirmation and that they are paying less than $0.05 per transaction.
BU signaling tells me I better sell before it crashes.
Miners have all the power, this is nothing new, without them you have no blockchain. If they decide to be evil with all that mining power they could have a long string of empty blocks for BTC right when the fork starts, they could swell up the mempool on all BTC nodes and make the entire network crash.

Eventually they'll realize that the volume of transactions and the amount of money in transit is not enough to sustain the already ridiculous hashpower armrace and energy waste.
Those resources could be put to better use if we had different ways to index and verify transactions, ways so that blocks don't need to even be broadcasted (as every full node already has pretty much the entire set of inputs/outputs on the mempool)

therefore time to introduce blockchain technology (not centralized databases).
You can have a distributed blockchain network of high performant servers that would gather transactions from standard bank issued wallets and store transactions into blocks, just like bitcoin, only that instead of using bitcoins, you'd move trust from proof of work, into a centralized model of trust ruled by a federation of keys, keys owned by banks.
Users can move their checking/saving electronic balance into their blockchain accounts the same way today they can move the same balances into paper money when they go to ATMs.
Once the balance is settled out of their ordinary accounts into the bank's blockchain via federated signature by the bank, these tokens can be transfered representing different currencies.
You now have a blockchain that is highly scalable, energy efficient, as all that needs to happen once transactions are packed into blocks (that could be issued way faster and with way more transactions), you could order transactions canonically in the block and once everything is verified, the bank signs the block and broadcasts to the other servers, and whoeverelse wants to keep a copy of the blockchain.
Forget about price volatility as the tokens on such blockchains could represent all the different fiat currencies in the world.
welcome to cashless society and tracking of every transaction out there.
just like we love Bitcoin, people will love these decentralized but centrally controlled blockchains as they will bring forth many of the benefits bitcoin bring, with the many of the regulations we suffer from today in the banking world, and complete tracking of how money moves.
Many existing Bitcoin companies will be smart enough to pivot and build/repurpose their existing services on top of such chains in order to survive, as the initial network effect will be too important to ignore.

decentralization how? serious question.
Let's say everybody wanted to use Bitcoin Classic, except the Chinese miners. If they keep mining small blocks it doesn't matter if everyone else is running classic, they get to make the blocks.
Sounds like China has Bitcoin grabbed by the balls.

@_date: 2016-01-24 11:38:57
No, instead we need a way to not even have to send the blocks. To not have that problem.
[The Invertible Bloom Filter proposal by Gavin is brilliant]( perhaps it hasn't been implemented because they found some holes in it, but that seems to path to put our minds into.
The logic is that we already have all the transactions sitting on the mempool, all you need to do, is to send a fixed size data structure that lets everyone with a mempool re-create the blocks on their and verify that the block is valid. End of the fucking excuse of propagation issues. Bitcoin for the masses, fuck 1mb blocks, fuck off-chain, give me my damn coffee transactions, give me back my damn $0.01 micro transactions, let's enable economies of huge transactional volumes, no lightning network mining incentive killing overly engineered solutions.

20Mb blocks are entirely doable, [1000tps are entirely doable on chain]( far better solutions have been proposed, everything is entirely doable from a technological standpoint. 
The problem is human, a tiny group of developers hijacked the entire protocol and anything that's not in their agenda is now deemed an altcoin. If this had been managed by a sane person, we'd have had a block size increase ages ago, followed by SegWit, followed by upgrades to the protocol to support new incentives to full nodes and what not. Instead we're just playing with shit like monkeys here.
It will be impossible to reach consensus unless consensus mechanisms are implemented in the protocol itself. Everyone should read Mike Hearn's last post from beginning to end, it's good to understand the history of the project. We're not only at square one, we're going in reverse when these stupid overly complex solutions start to be taken seriously when all we needed was to allow a few more transactions per block while we kept fixing the rest.

It's all a matter of finally knowing that you have enough for what you expect Bitcoin's value to be, and focusing your investments into other areas.
Right now we have about 13,400,975 bitcoins in circulation, with a value around $380, putting the market value at $5,092,370,500 ($5Bn)
What do you think the market value of Bitcoin will be in 2,5,10,30 years? (don't answer in your mind yet)
Unless someone majorly fucks up the blockchain [e.g. major hole in SHA algorithm for instant nonce discovery, NSA-like organization destroying the network with 51% attack to fuck everyone's balances], I don't see anything but upside, it's too good to be stopped.
In investment banking scales $5Bn is a drop in the bucket (just for the value of the network alone) for what this network will be doing for billions of people and organizations: Banking, Money Transfers, eCommerce (between way more people currently excluded), Retail electronic payments, distributed insurance, distributed crowd lending, distributed  stock exchanges.
If you research into the market caps of those industries, and being conservative, you thought in the next 5 to 10 years Bitcoin would just eat 10% of the business done by the status quo to support those sectors, you will come up with a market cap in addition to the $5bn we have today. 
Now divide that number by the number of Bitcoins you have, do you think you have enough Bitcoins?
If so, stop buying bitcoins, and the next bitcoins you use should be to USE it. If that's not enough and you're a long bull like I am, try holding on for a while and don't buy more than you're willing to lose, although your comment on your life being irrevocably wrong in the event that we are wrong tells me you shouldn't have much more money to keep spending on Bitcoin, so, stop.

except a bunch of people forget it. The fact is Bitcoin's money supply is eventually deflationary and if you keep blocks small, you won't have fees to make the operation sustainable. 
Otherwise fees will start to rise as block rewards diminish and nobody will be able to use Bitcoin as miners gtfo when the rewards start dropping lower and lower, no hashpower, no security on the chain.
We need miners to get used to shitload of transactions and to rake in sustainable fees of the many.

on the other hand, small blocks centralize bitcoin into the only people who can afford to pay the fees and into the hand of would be LN hub operators, which will most likely be companies wanting to take over Visa/Mastercard (Google and Facebook would be good candidates to know everything about you, including spending activity). Off chain is centralization in my book.
@_date: 2017-03-27 15:16:51
that's how I used to think, however exchanges clearly stated they will introduce another token.
looking at miner's incentives, and what they could do once there's a fork it's very likely they'll attack the small block blockchain with empty blocks (which would make confirmation times very very long and the small chain unusable) given their hashpower majority, dump their BTCs and start manipulating the price of BTU which would have a huge (perhaps over 500%) upside.
@_date: 2017-03-24 16:54:58
wonder what happens if all that chinese mining power colludes and has about a week's worth of empty blocks ready once they start pumping out big blocks in parallel to the Bitcoin Core chain (thus earning bitcoin rewards on both chains and immediatly dumping the BTC they earn to cause market crash because they've also dumped all of it to purchase BTU), bunch of transactions held up in the mempool eventually crashing nodes, people getting pissed and then through market manipulation big whales and fund managers start selling out BTC, a panic ensues, BTU still worth pennies, they start buying, people have no choice but to switch to BTU chain...

I still don't understand why so many bitcoiners consider such a volatile asset a "store of value" 
For all we know the price could spike to $1,000 during the halvening and then comes a massive sell out (Great store of value!) when miners greed kicks in once they know they can't afford to mine anymore on a system so limited in terms of scale. (Not everybody will be able to use Bitcoin with 1mb blocks let me remind you, for now it's just a great speculative asset)
 Bitcoin is a highly speculative and risky asset, nothing more, nothing less if you look at it from an investment perspective. Swing traders have a blast with this daily volatility 24/7 and a lot of folks that think this is a store of value are nothing but fresh meat for seasoned traders and quants coming from wall st running bots on every exchange they can. don't buy into the "store of value" mentality.

yes, your only restriction would be not being able to mine your own coins. Only a federation of keys owned by the banks are the ones able to add/remove coins from the system.
Since you don't have to mine anything, transactions are simply signed off by the federation and since each coin represents actual fiat value this is highly scalable and it presents no volatility, except the volatility of the underlying fiat, since fiat has millions of users it's much harder to manipulate than an experimental cryptocurrency like bitcoin.

when OP reads all the answers he'll understand most people here are fanatics repeating ad-lib arguments that don't make any sense.
Block limiting and fee pressure don't solve anything, it just deters people from using the system so the problem is hidden.
Meanwhile many of us have moved on, and diversified our crypto investments and so should you. There's no way to convince them that Bitcoin's greatest asset isn't that "it's hard to change", it's the opposite. The fact that the bitcoin protocol is made of software gives it the power to evolve, adapt and become stronger. Since Gavin left, Bitcoin stopped doing that. Even Mike Hearn told this community everything that needed to be done (not that Bitcoin was dead), but still people just read headlines and didn't take the time to listen.
It's all about narrow minded interests and ego. There's no way this project will move forward with the governance clusterf it's in.

that is if the price goes up 2x or more.

More competition now reusing a lot of what was built for Bitcoin in terms of access to cryptocurrencies with fiat.
@_date: 2016-06-18 16:51:20
not if it only works for a handful of people. bitcoiners live in a bubble, bitcoin is used by very few people, it's not as big as you think. it's actually depressing how little people use it, how small it is, and what a hard sell it is, specially when you know you shouldn't be recommending it to people because it won't work for all.
@_date: 2016-06-20 15:55:52
The government put very tough price controls on every thing, everything is regulated, no entrepreneur can compete, no entrepreneur is allowed to import anything.
All industrial and agricultural production is state owned and not producing anything. They made themselves a mono-producing country, being oil their product. Oil prices went below $50, now the country is in big trouble.
Those who could produce left, those who wanted to stay are hands tied buying what they can in the black market, and the government response is:
- this is all fault of the US.
- this is all fault of the opossition who wages an economic war against the revolution.
- more regulation
- bags of very basic food handed to people if they show support for the revolution.
It's disgusting. It's all because we've been invaded by Cuba. The people in power answer only to the Castros in Havana.

last time around, there weren't options like Ethereum which you can purchase and speculate with US dollars (with a much higher upside btw, the next big bubble is brewing there, the halvening might be of help to hedge against a possible Bitcoin collapse). 
Back then Bitcoin was pretty much alone. And now so many other forks will be able to easily plug-in to all the infrastructure left behind by Bitcoin. Bitcoin needs to scale or die, without scale and usability it's worthless and the bubble will pop.

the segwit &gt; LN path is not sustainable for the mining community. Why is that so hard to understand?
Tiny blocks, very few transactions, diminishing block rewards every few years. Unsustainable.
Going off-chain is not in miner's economic interests.
@_date: 2017-01-06 13:17:27
if you are going to build some software/service that needs to query the blockchain and you need no latency, e.g you want to analyze transaction activity, or you plan on starting a company and you want to verify transactions without depending on some third party api... or if you feel like wasting hard drive space, cpu and ram because you want the network to have one more mode to make it one more node safer (altruism), or you want to learn how a node really works (curiosity), or you want to send a patch or fork bitcoin (development). other than those there are no economic incentives if you aren't running miners on the local network that need to check what's on the mempool. This is one of the things that sucks about Bitcoin, no economy incentives for running full nodes, the p2p network is very small at the moment, not even 10k nodes, very easy to game if a bank wanted to do so.
I wont name other coins but some bitcoin forks have fixed this issue, and in one of them, if your full node commits to freeze a certain amount of coins you are entitled to a % of every block reward (you also get to vote on how things move forward with the technology as you are a proven stake holder in the economy), which makes sense for helping to verify transactions and using your resources. Do it, but eventually you will probably give up after a few months or years, you will realize that there are companies out there that will be running nodes anyway as they do have a real incentive to do so, which is another reason in my opinion that the 1mb blocksize limit argument about being able to run nodes in africa is absurd. regular users dont need to have the full blockchain and satoshi said it clearly.

good luck offering a LN hub to users when on-chain fees soar above just $10 and big corporations like Facebook, Google, Amazon sign contracts with Blockstream and offer to open free "Bitcoin (LN) Wallets" with free recharges, because they'll be mining your every transaction to recoup the on-chain costs, good luck competing. very decentralized it will become.

I keep wondering if this hike in price has been triggered by someone who knows the COIN ETF is about to get out and they're creating a bubble with 10s of millions (which they will burst) weeks before the ETF makes it, to then buy 5x more Bitcoin below $500, just in time for the ETF.
Or... they're pumping the price, to make the ETF sound even more juicy. The price hikes we are seeing are not healthy, noob traders beware.
@_date: 2017-01-12 17:50:31
the advantage is immediate access to trillions of dollars, no need to buy bitcoins directly. not everybody has the time/patience/capability to buy bitcoins directly, but a lot of people/companies/institutions do have access to capital markets from different parts of the world and can buy millions worth of bitcoin with a phone call.

Tell that to people that make $20, $50 tops a month in Venezuela.
If I pay for my transaction it's nobody's business what the amount field has, weighs just the same as any other transaction, it's effing bytes.
If you took a walk around Bitcoin communities in Facebook, where people don't have access to exchanges, where they don't want to use LocalBitcoins and they just want to trade one on one, you would not believe the amount of work people go over to buy and sell a mere USD $5 worth of Bitcoin, there are organic reputation systems where others vouch for previous transactions, where they make sure thieves don't ever trade again. $5 is a big deal for them, for you it's a grande vanilla latte in Starbucks.


By that logic, no single transaction should be replicated in all nodes, and that's the main problem, this would require tremendous architectural changes, and this community got divided over a simple constant that needed to be raised. I'm glad there was a fork, hopefully with competition thing will move forward faster without any further c$

the one difference with all the other altcoins (forks) based off bitcoin's source code is that this one has been bootstrapped using Bitcoin's ledger up to the fork point, so I wouldnt call it an altcoin, it's an alternate Bitcoin.

If you look at how other projects have solved the issues of block size limits this makes a lot of sense. Please read my entire response with a bit of an open mind.
If you had a dynamic block reward system, on which you'd penalize bigger blocks if their size is x% bigger than the mean of the last 100 blocks, then you have blocksize limits solved.
You can only do this if you have an infinite supply of coins (inflation). However, you don't have to add a shitload of coins every year once you get past the 21 million coins. All you need to add is less than 1% coins, a fixed amount, say 150k new coins every year, as time goes by, the 150k/total supply, tends to 0% inflation, but you still keep incentives for miners to run the network.
It's actually brilliant shit. But if you read a tweet and don't know about how other people have already solved these issues it sounds crazy.
This is how monero works btw.

any significant amount of money put into Bitcoin by Venezuelans is only temporary and for the purposes of capital flight, in a matter of hours or days it is converted back to fiat elsewhere. get real. same thing is happening with the chinese that need to get their money out, they're not stupid to leave it in such a volatile currency. therefore you keep seeing these surges and then price goes back down, people need to exit.
Any other amounts are usually very low, it's sad/funny to see people going at lengths to trade just $5, but it's the amounts they can deal with after their local currency has been hyper-devaluated, some professionals make only $20/month, it's very sad.

@_date: 2016-12-09 17:19:57
the one way to have decentralized exchanges that include fiat, is to make all the bidirectional Bitcoin ATM operators join a distributed exchange (like BitSquare).
Each fiat currency would be represented with a corresponding digital token that any other ATM (and Bitsquare participant) in the network will trust as a 1:1 value for that fiat, you'd have to trust that the ATM's have proper note scanners and that the operators aren't participating with fake balances.

they don't. the whole system becomes economically unsustainable in the long term, there will be no reason to mine, eventually only big corporations will be the only ones to afford on-chain transactions (most likely the big LN hub operators, which will offer channel opening and closing for free pushing the little guys out of the market, think Facebook, Google, Amazon or Banks, not the Bitcoin I signed up for in 2014), it will all crumble as people simply switch to simpler options that allow them to use no intermediaries.

What's crazy is limiting the system so you can run a node in senegal so that only a handful of people can use the system.
As it is if you look at the network size there's only 5k nodes, which are primarily developers, bitcoin companies that need such nodes, and miners. Regular people don't and won't run full nodes, that's a romantic view of Bitcoin. All this does is limit the amount of people that can actually USE bitcoin for transfering value.

I think the erosion of wealth comes largely due to the strict chokehold on currency.
When you make your currency unacceptable by any other country, and you have an economy that's based on importing goods, the only ones that have access to such goods are the ones that have access to internationally accepted coins, while the rest is simply enslaved by worthless ever devaluating currency.
I think it would be an escape valve if a lot of people could get a hold of a currency that's worth something and which couldn't be controlled in any way by the government.

don't worry, once the AirBnB engineers are asked about Bitcoin's capabilities, they'll have to decline from doing anything, like so many other companies have had to. 5tx/sec is only for experiments.

@_date: 2016-11-22 02:25:18
there's been endless proposals on how to decide the block size, perhaps you haven't taken the time to read or listen.
many versions are inspired on how we deal with difficulty, in this case through moving averages on transactional demand.
e.g. If Bitcoin wasn't so limited, perhaps big companies would actually use it to process things like payrolls (at a massive scale), the demand on the blockchain would certainly be a hell of a lot different around pay days.

what you say is what I have been saying from the very beginning, it's effing obvious to people that actually pay and get paid in Bitcoin, and who are suffering waits of up to 8 hours because all of a sudden their fee got outbid in a mempool of 45k transactions that shouldn't be so full in the first place, as 45k transactions should be NOTHING in terms of transactional volume for an open, universally and permissionless financial network.
Obviously it will be easier to sustain the mining incentives when you have lots of transactions paying lots of small fees, the economies of scale will have a positive growth cycle for it, more people means, harder to manipulate bitcoin exchanges, which means the unavoidable entrance of Bitcoin to forex markets, that level of price stability would make Bitcoin more attractive as a store of value for regular folks out there who are tired of paying bank fees every month for not having a "minimum balance", the more people moving their money to the blockchain, the more they will want to use bitcoin for mundane things, which means SHITLOAD of transactions and transaction fees.
But no, we rather have blocks smaller in bytes than the animated gifs with memes people send every millisecond on facebook and twitter, to supposedly have a decentralized network, that can be used by a handful of people... moronic thinking.

wouldn't more load mean more vested interests in the network, meaning the big league players could finally consider Bitcoin as a viable, more efficient and cost effective payment option, I'm talking about the Amazons, Google's, Ebays who could bring a serious amount of demand on the blockchain and who today, in their right mind, can't even consider Bitcoin as an option. wouldn't this mean more market orders to buy and sell bitcoin in exchanges worldwide thus making it harder for whales to manipulate the Bitcoin prices, wouldn't that then lead to stable cryptocurrency which could finally be used worldwide for saving purposes, wouldn't that destroy the need for saving accounts?

Time to create the "Venezuelan Dollar".
Burn USD $1 to a blackhole Bitcoin address and tag the transaction with a Venezuelan-Dollar-Blockchain address. At the same time broadcast a mint transaction to the VenezuelanDollar mempool along with a market based fee. It'd be easy to implement oracles that corroborate the average Bitcoin price to USD, giving these users a 1:1 parity.
If 100k venezuelans burnt $1, and used some of that free energy to mine VenezuelanDollar blocks (the only coins created would be from the burnt transaction requests), they'd have more liquidity than the daily volume on their biggest exchange (SurBitCoin)
I think that'd be enough to get the ball rolling and more bitcoins burnt. Once you start weighing paper notes you have to admit your currency has failed.
Any Venezuelan computer science students smart enough for the challenge? This would be one PEACEFUL way to free yourselves from the currency-based oppression which you are subject of.

no bro, apples to oranges with your analogy.
You can't do magic, there's only so much you can optimize, even if each transaction would magically take a single byte, 1 million transactions every 10 minutes for a WORLD WIDE OPEN FINANCIAL NETWORK is still not enough, it will not scale. The likes of mainstream e-commerce in the world can't possibly take it seriously and that's why we are stuck. No Bitcoin demand, no price hike, only whales manipulating markets.
The analogy is more like the blockchain is a train made of wagons and there's a lot of people waiting to get on the train at the station (the mempool), doesn't matter how many people (transactions) you can fit per wagon (block), eventually they will not all fit and they will have to wait at the station, so what do you do, you add more capacity to your rail system by adding more trains and bigger cars.
If you don't do that people get tired of waiting and use some other transport system.

Before we go and waste the time of a CEO of a company that could be awesome for Bitcoin in the future, we should get real and understand why no company of that size actually uses Bitcoin. We need to scale first guys, get real.
If the guy takes it seriously and they have good engineers there, someone will have to raise their hand and let him know that Bitcoin can only take up to 1Mb worth of transactions worldwide every 10mins, which equates to about 5tx/sec. A company the size of AirBnB alone could easily do 20tx/sec on Bitcoin alone, it's just a really bad joke right now, and it will sound like a waste of time for them when Bitcoin is actually ready.
let's stop calling wolf. we're not ready. When Bitcoin can do some real transactional business ON CHAIN, we won't even have to suggest it to these companies. In the meantime, I hope that thought otherwise and read up to this point, finally understand why the urgency to scale, not by a factor of 2x,3x or 4x, but by at least by a factor of at least 3 or 4 orders of magnitude (10000 tx/s)

because in the real world, it's almost impossible to connect any two peers on the internet without a central computer that defeats Network Address Translation limitations (NAT hell)
To open and close channels with other entities to transact with, you will most likely need to go through a hub computer. The people running these services will start competing in transactional performance and will try to lure more Bitcoin users into their hub so that they can provide you the ability to transact with not just the first entity you intended to but with others without having to open/close further channels, basically having you lock your funds with them. (and what happens when you do convince people to do this, and then all of a sudden, everyone running a LN hub is asked to have KYC or money transmitting licenses... only real companies with funding will be able to run those hubs, you guessed it, Coinbase, Circle, etc. more centralization)
The LN has a place, and it's for metered services, recurrent-pre paid services. The true path to decentralization is having transactions on the blockchain. LN will lead to either major channel centralization, or to the creation of a federation of LN services, a lightning network mafia, which you bet will make a ton of money also tracking how money is spent now that it can't be tracked on the blockchain.
Large blocks are a reality you will have to face if you have more usage, the network  will obviously need more resources to do this, just like you can't be a hobby miner and people didn't bitch about it, why are we going to be bitching about something truly necessary. If the chinese can't be in, good riddance, as of now the majority of the network is at the whim of a communist regime, but I'm sure they'll find a way. If we don't scale, Bitcoin has no purpose and we better do something else.

btw, I think you should seriously take a look at IPFS. I believe they've done everything you wanted to, take a look if you want to build upon something a bit more solid, which has the same ideals as yours, and that has been implemented by world class p2p developers (the lead guy (jbenet) of this project is a disciple and p2p uber geek of Prof. David Mazières, who co-authored the Kademlia paper)
The client already works, it's written in Go, which outperforms Python up to 3 orders of magnitude in multiple benchmarks

@_date: 2015-08-24 16:05:16
I'm refering to the Lighning Network (LN) when I talk about federated centralization.
LN servers seem like the type of solution that will quickly be adopted by the likes of Coinbase, Circle, then perfected and sold to banks.
Moving all transactions away from the blockchain when you have a finite number of coins to be mined remove all incentives for Bitcoin miners as the time goes by.
A small federated network could never compete with the hassle free user on ramping we have nowadays when everything can still be done directly on the blockchain, just install a wallet and go. With LN you will most likely have to register on LN servers, then government comes in, and all the KYC rules will alienate everyone outside the first world from Bitcoin.
That's what I'm referring with centralized solutions.
I believe we have and will have the technology to go to several gigs per block, all decentralized, all open.
I mention LN because Adam Back himself told me to go to the lightning network mailing list when discussing about the low fee costs of transacting on the blockchain not being a main motivator for most people (vs decentralization)
@_date: 2015-08-24 16:35:03
is there any specification on fees to use a LN server? Do you pay a fee to open/close channel? do you pay a fee per transaction?

Maidsafe's vision of a decentralized internet with their technology is unfeasable given their licensing. They use the GPL, which would force people building services with their libraries to also be opensourced, this would leave out a lot of people that just can't do that. They should switch to MIT, forced freedom isn't freedom.
The other option is buying their commercial license... nothing with such restrictions has ever scaled to the whole internet, only truly free tech is the one that can be adopted by all.

Here's also Adam Back being out of touch with reality.


Bitcoin.  I think the interesting thing is trustlessness - being able
to transact without relying on third parties" -Adam Back
So according to this logic, people will use Bitcoin, even if it's more expensive to transact than fiat, because you know, trustlessness, decentralization... what a massive fail Bitcoin will be if fees start getting too expensive, all the people in latin america who are too busy trying to ship mining equipment, who are super excited of how bitcoin works and who don't have a clue of this debate are going to get real pissed if things go the way these academics want to with their artificially imposed limits.
It's super cheap and you have to force feed it to people already!!! these people are so out of touch. In order to establish or replace inter-subjective phenomena like currencies, religions, rights, the first thing you need to have is a better inter-subjective phenomena, if Bitcoin is inferior it will fail.

Re 2.
Would you rather have your transactions processed by a small number of servers (easier to DDOS), or processed and validated by miners and full nodes?
To use the LN you'd have to go through LN servers, which will start fighting to cluster users and provide better user to user services, going from server to server will be a nightmare, channels will be closed left and right when connectivity issues arise, so many complications out of a centralized approach that removes the transparency and decentralization the blockchain consensus brings.
Not to mention that it will remove shitload of fees from the blockchain, and then once the coinbase rewards start halfing it does kill bitcoin as there will be no incentive to keep mining.
In practice LN will be put forth by companies like Coinbase, BitPay, etc. they'll try to force people into using their federated network. LN is simply the standarization of these companies via a payment channel based protocol, how the *bleep* is that not centralization?

Stop bitching and propose a better solution on Bitcoin Core or your own fork, a 1Mb block is certainly the end of this network which would be doomed to the hands of a centralized federation of servers nicely PRed under the Lightning Network proposal which goes away from what Bitcoin stands for and which will be likely run by banks.

Raising the limit is not enough, the limit needs to be removed altogether and the spam issue needs to be dealt with a minimum required fee that's based on things like:
- Transactional rate.
- Amount of money being transfered.
If Bitcoin is to be what we've been sold it will be, [you will actually need several gigs per block](
And enough of the bullshit that everyone is going to be running full nodes, this shit will run in the cloud, or by professional miners, the mining difficulty makes it already impossible for noobs to mine unless they live in a place with no energy costs (like Venezuela)

Good luck on that (given how many things already depend on it, great feature set and huge network effects already in place). 
To an extent Github is becoming too much of a central point, and already censoring projects out there. Therefore it does need a truly decentralized competitor, a place where you can host your git repos without the risk of being censored. The hard part will always be matching and outperforming them on the experience, github effing pwns.

make sure to wait until the blocksize limit issue has been fixed. Nobody should be promising the moon when this thing can only take about 3,000 transactions every 10 minutes. If you somehow manage to convince them to do something with the blockchain, and it goes into production, and then your customers have to wait hours for something that was promised as being instant and cheap, oh boy.
Once we can do, say 50,000 per second, then evangelize all you want. For now, Bitcoin can't scale unless you do offchain transactions, which is bs, see what happened with MtGox...

is it possible to measure exactly the time between a transaction is submitted to the network (enters the mempool) to the time the transaction has been added to the blockchain and 2 more blocks have passed?
can we figure out a way to adjust the maximum blocksize based on this medium wait period?
if the wait period starts surpassing an unacceptable time, say 45 minutes, then we double the blocksize, the blocksize then remains at that new value until that mean wait period goes down to say 15 minutes (less transactional demand, no transactions are waiting on the mempool) and then we reduce the size by half.
The inspiration for this idea comes from the way difficulty is handled with a moving average for the past hour, we don't put limits to hashing power and we haven't had any issues with the centralization that it brings as more and more hobbysts simply can't mine unless they live in a country with almost free/super cheap energy.

Who funds Blockstream, [Mosaic Ventures]( and others, most likely VC types with good connections in bigger companies like Google, Facebook, Amazon.
Perhaps their end game is to deliver a "distributed" but in actuality centralized high scalability solution off-chain, in the form of sidechains + lightning network hubs/wallets.
It's not written anywhere in the bitcoin protocol what the cost of opening and closing, and transacting off-chain will be.
Say you want to disrupt the payment industry, become 100x more capable than VISA/MASTERCARD/AMEX/Western Union together, who has the money, resources and know-how to run massive cloud operations, mainstream user production quality software...
Say you want to be a LN Hub operator, why would Alice open up a channel with you when she can open a channel (user friendly lighting wallet) for free on Amazon or Facebook and have her transactions run smoothly with lots of benefits, friendlier user experience, and in USD/EUR/others, not even knowing they're using Bitcoin on the backend?
Who do you think will use all the available blockspace? do you think you'll be able to afford opening and closing payment channels when fees go beyond $500 and all the blockchain settlement ops are run by these giants?
What's going to happen to miners? they're going to have to close up shop, and mining most likely be taken over by blockstream or the ones running the LN hubs.
LN is a dangerous path to follow if you keep blocks small.

none, the private key is never sent over the wire/air, it's only used by the wallet's cpu to sign transactions, which are then sent and can be verified by the other wallets using the public key (that travels over the wire/air).

As for mispricing, the price is right, there's simply no demand for it at the moment for the price to go up. (and the $1,000+ price was fake out of fake bitcoins traded on mt.gox), if you think about it, it is quite amazing that people are already willing to give more than $200 for 1 bitcoin, considering the whole thing started in satoshi's computer being worth 0 and people would only give hundreds of a penny for it, I think we've come a long way, but yes, the potential is enourmous.

If you've ever had to deal with a congested subway/metro system foryour daily commute (of which you are sick of), your world-changing mind might perhaps start thinking of how to get rid of the problem, and you will naturally come to the following solutions, and they don't have to be exclusive as they all help alleviate and eventually solve the congestion issues.
- If the train lenghts do not span the entire station lengths, it's a no brainer adding more carts (that'd be the equivalent a block size increase)
But what if that's already the case? -which I believe it's not in bitcoin yet, but segwit proponents think it is-
- You optimize for more people to fit in trains. You start removing seats and you make everyone stand up. That to me is segwit and it doesn't solve the problem, it only lasts for so long, but if you have more cars with optimized space you can fit a lot more people in the system.
Eventually the system still gets congested, and perhaps you've been on a train station at peak times and you see how when 2 or 3 trains coming back to back clear the station.
- You reduce train intervals by adding more trains to the system.
This would be the equivalent of having faster block minting periods, something that we can't do because of Bitcoin's finite amount, something other coins have solved by adding a FIXED number of coins once a nominal coin limit has been minted. In practice it allows you to play with coin supply, decongestion while still keeping a deflationary economic behavior since the FIXED yearly extra supply makes inflation tend to 0% as they represent a smaller percentage of the coins already in circulation.
So then there comes a point where you can't add more trains to that train line, what do you do? You add more train lines and bifurcate traffic, you look for common passenger trips and add other lines, express stations and what not.
The people you send out of the system via Buses, Cabs, Bikes, etc, that's not part of the system, and this is what I'd consider off-chain solutions, but there should be a way that we can find emulates having multiple/sharded chains.

I started worrying seriously about this issue when I got deeper into OpenBazaar.
If Bitcoin can only handle 7 tps (at best, it's more like 3tps), and if a mere doubling of the max blocksize would get us to a laughable 14tps, the success of a decentralized app for buying and selling things ON-CHAIN (as it needs multisig in most cases for doing decentralized escrow) would easily destroy the system on which it's supposed to run on.
If OpenBazaar, or some app like OpenBazaar manages to work as advertised, you'd have tens of thousands of stores running in a matter of months, and hundreds of thousands of shoppers finally having a way to spend their Bitcoin.
This would create a positive value cycle for Bitcoin. A currency is as valuable as it's useful. This would in turn cause more demand for Bitcoin thus putting pressure on price, more attention would go on the why of the sudden demand pressure into OpenBazaar, which would easily start filling blocks just for OpenBazaar transactions, what will the rest of the world need to do to transact? as it is, fees would go up, and a lot of people would be pissed when their transactions require so much time to be confirmed, if confirmed at all.
So yes, I'm worried.

maybe you should fund it in stages then, but each stage gets less equity on the album. On the first stage try to raise the necessary money for the first 3 tracks, and do a damn good job about it, on the next stage fund 2-3 more, now raising the same amount of money but handing out less equity. This way you reduce the risk for your first investors, and you prioritize on picking/creating the best job, and you don't fill the album with songs that would be crap. Make each song a hit if possible and convince your investors you're doing a good job, that your project is on time. Don't make us blow $20k blindly.

Nobody in their right mind would've approved an ETF on Bitcoin as things are today. 
The market can easily be manipulated because there's so many other places where you can play the arbitrage game, which is the main reason why it got rejected.
On the other hand, Bitcoin can't scale, it's a toy and we can't agree on how to move forward, time to wake up and move on. Sell while you can.
Just looking at how people here were actually thinking it could've been approved given the circus we're in right now shows how delusional this community has become and when finally people wake up as the hard fork approaches the crash will be spectacular and sadly a lot of people who didn't take the time to see what's happened before will lose it all.

"Here's this magic internet money, but sorry, you can't use it unless you're rich and you want to settle millions per transactions because the fees aren't worth it to do retail..."
Good luck with getting that to fly.
I pity people like you who want to censor the use of Bitcoin. Don't you get the whole purpose of money is to transform value regardless of what gets turned into what?
If Bitcoin is money it's none of your business how people want to use it ,and guess what, it actually doesn't matter what you think or want Bitcoin to be used for, you can't stop people from sending whatever amount they need for whatever purpose they need.

some people here would certainly like Bitcoin to fail.
If you look at the mempool right now, there's transactions, that at best (if every block were to be completely filled by miners) would have to wait 2.5 hours to get a first confirmation.
Why would you want to do these absurd premature and over complicated and unnecessary optimizations, just to keep your clearly failed idea of a fee market when you can let everyone transact and cover the miner's cost with the fees of everyone?
I guess the small blockers want Bitcoin to fail now.

Saudis went all out and produced shitload of oil.
Now other poorly managed huge oil producers can't live with a sub $30 oil price, met to reduce production. But other players, like Iran, which finally has had its sanction lifted are saying "Fuck off", we can use the money. If you reduce production, fine by us, we get more market share and we don't have to do anything, not good, they're in a deadlock if they can't agree.
Meanwhile I can't wait for a 2x or 5x improvement in battery capacity, electric cars with 600 mile, to 1000 mile ranges would be possible, home use batteries and what not, that'd fuck oil prices even further.

it will be a great addition, but if left uncurbed it almost looks like a Bitcoin replacement. If you manage to put most of the transactions off-chain and people are fine with that, and you keep having tiny 1Mb blocks, as block rewards diminish from 25 BTC per block to 12, to 6, to 3, o 1, to less than 1 BTC, what do you think miners will do, if their blocks only contain a handful of transactions with very little in fees? It becomes even more unsustainable than it is already, the network becomes to expensive to support such a small number of on-chain transactions because you managed to convince people to use LN.
Hashpower dries, then blockchain susceptible to 50% attacks, attacks on LN channels occur, the whole thing goes to shit.
Satoshi was/were very wise. The whole thing is decentralized because you have a decentralized ledger. The moment you start incentivizing that much activity outside the blockchain then you start creating centralization.
Maybe if LN ever happens and succeeds, maybe it could somehow evolve into something that doesn't need the original blockchain to begin with and miners will shift into LN channel operators, competing to get your bitcoins, maybe the market will tell what the fees will be on such network, in the meantime you betcha there's a lot of people working on on-chain alternatives, and the bankers are also not sitting idly.

If you want performance and faster development cycles you should think of a JRE based approach, you don't even have to use Java, but you want to use a runtime that has enterprise quality performance.
If not I'd prefer the core of it implemented in a language proven to be several orders of magnitud faster on all benchmarks, C/C++, Rust, Golang or Java/JRE based would do it. Then you can create bindings for higher abstractions to be built on top if you want to extend it with Ruby, Python, JS.

No amount should be censored, the amount is irrelevant, fees aren't % based last time I checked, nor it costs more or less to send that amount on the blockchain, it's freaking bytes. What a disconnect with reality.
If Bitcoin can't handle it then you know what will happen.
What I pay for a latte here is 1/2 a minimum monthly salary in Venezuela and that amount could even mean living or dying for someone. Get out of your fucking first world bubbles. People outside the US are the ones that need Bitcoin the most, they don't have access to credit card or banking services.
What an elitist way of looking at Bitcoin, the open network for the rich.
What people spend their money on is nobody's business, for that I use the nosey government regulated banking systems, thought the whole point of an open blockchain was precisely the freedom it brings.

I imagine it's more like a lot of people are fighting in a train, then the engineer says over the speaker:
"If you don't like the way this train is running, there's another train on the next station that might get you where you're going, however, we'll only be able to get to our destination on a single train, either this one, or the next one. The rule is that only the train with the majority of passengers will be the one to get us there."
Then some people start getting up and lining up before the next stop to switch to the newer better train, while some are stubborn and want to sit on the current train.
When the train stops, more than half of the people switch to the train on the other side of the platform, both engineers do a head count, and the train with more people leaves at full speed.
When the guys on the first train see the train isn't moving, and they try to show their ticket to the first engineer, the engineer tells them that this ticket is no longer valid, that they should go on the new train with the majority to make their ticket valid and get to their destination.
Eventually everyone  looks at each other like John Travolta and have no choice but to go on the majority train as the old one isn't going anywhere.

you have a real incentive to run a full node, other than altruism.
for a master node to get any reward, it must "freeze" 1000 coins, this helps mitigate price volatility as it commits participants to hold value.
then it is superior because these full nodes provide other services that allow for true fungibility and privacy as coins are mixed. other services too, instant confirmations and voting.
meanwhile we cant agree how to inclreass the blocksize.
At this pace, Bitcoin will be the napster of crypto and dash could become the bittorrent. Miners have too much power in bitcoin and they are choking it to death.

It's good to note that you've just kept your wealth, while everyone else has lost 2 thirds of it, therefore giving you the impression of feeling like you tripled it.

Let's for a minute be neutral AND READ THE MESSAGE
There's other cryptos that perform better than Bitcoin (true [faster confirmation times, cheaper tx fees, less resource usage, etc.])
Have more features than Bitcoin (true [fungibility, privacy, instant confirmations, consensus/voting systems as part of their protocols, monetary incentive to run full nodes, higher level abstractions for contracts, friendlier to other non-crypto developers to integrate with, etc.])
More receptive and cooperative teams (true)
Better upgrade paths than Bitcoin (true)
First mover advantage gap is closing, look at the market cap ratios and how Bitcoin keeps losing ground. In technology you can't wait that long to make decisions, a modest block raise was a no brainer to experiment while we had time to then put segwit and other more ambitious protocol changes, we're still at the same place as 2 years ago with respect to scalability, meanwhile other projects have passed us technologically speaking, all they need is more media attention and some of you to try them out and wake up, and they will get it as Bitcoin loses ground.
Sucks that the immediate reaction is always to mock, or attack specific people instead of hearing the criticism, the same thing happened with Mike Hearn, he couldn't have given a better diagnosis of what was wrong and how to fix it, yet everyone just demonized the guy that single handedly brought us Bitcoin to android.
If we can't cooperate or agree on anything Bitcoin isn't going anywhere. It doesn't matter if you think core has the "best developers", it's all about getting a group of people to cooperate and move forward. We're moving nowhere right now.

if you end up doing only a handful of bitcoin transactions, this almost makes a point that you don't need a blockchain to keep your balances safe. How is this network safer than Bitcoin, how are the states of those channels protected, and why can LN do this so efficiently when Bitcoin can't.

because there's a big possibility that the nodes you will use to create those lightning channels will be centralized.
Think about the possibilities:
What if Facebook/Google decided to destroy Mastercard and they announced they're opening a service where it's free to open and close "Lightning Wallets" (aka Lightning Channels).
Nobody small could compete against them, probably 90%+ of transactions would go through them, now they'd also have your spending data, no privacy.
If we already have full blocks, think of the pressure this would put on the mempool when you have real mainstream usage, perhaps the cost to transact on-chain would skyrocket into the hundreds per transaction, making them the sole users of the bitcoin blockchain. They could collude to make a market that drives away anybody else, but which wouldn't make any financial sense for miners to keep mining, then the next step, these companies take over mining. So long decentralization.
We need as many transactions as the network can handle on-chain in order to keep miners securing the chain.

If I were a miner, and we're still in this golden era of 25 BTC per block, with block sizes being so small and almost no fees to collect, I rather put my hash power to mine empty or small blocks faster than the rest. 
[The next block reward halving is almost here]( and these shenanigans are actually making that moment come sooner than later as I believe the halving is based on block height (block number)
Make blocks big enough to earn another 25 BTC in fees alone and this will surely change.

"The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work."
so that's a proof-of-work based blockchain. the hashes can be created in other ways and it is still a blockchain.

in theory it sounds beautiful, but in practice there's absolutely no balance there because it became an arms race when it came to mining and the Chinese had a much favorable ground to do this.
The Chinese miners have all the power, if we disagreed with them, which we have, the alternate mining network would have very little hashpower in comparison, it'd be very vulnerable (specially to pissed chinese miners who will do whatever it takes to not lose their huge investment). 
We're married to their infrastructure in practice, it's not easy to dismiss so much hashpower. 
Unless we can have an equal amount of hashpower elsewhere, we need to face it, it's Chinacoin 
If we disagreed with them, they could easily perform a 51% attack on the revolutionary fork minutes later and make that blockchain worthless.
I also think it's no coincidence this happens in China where antitrust/feds probably have no jurisdiction to go after these actors for collusion.

Similar approach over here with [Seller.Trade]( [1-node-demo-here](
Will def. give it a spin and read how you're doing the decentralized part, are the stores supposed to talk to each other for any purpose?
In the case of Seller.Trade we route search through store instances using the Bittorrent DHT.
You can plug in whatever payment processor you like, as of now we've only added Bitpay.
Like your approach, buyers don't need anything except a Web Browser, they could pay with Bitcoin or Credit Card if so they choose.
Here's our [presentation video for the SellerTrade]( we did this during the Miami Bitcoin Hackathon.
We don't have synced databases like you seem to have (that seems kind of hard to scale to tens of millions of stores, but I might be wrong), each store is independent from the others, but they collaborate routing traffic.

wtf...? the dataset size does not matter to a hash function (it just takes longer, but factom can't do magic unless the hashing function is meant to be fast, and probably not so good), wether it's executed by factom or by X software. In the end the hash is just a number and it can be stored by anyone. so that's a BS selling point.

Here's how you do Factom "Proof of existence" for free using bittorrent:
1. document_data_and_date_hash = SHA1(document_no_matter_the_data_size ++ todays_date)
2. Create a .torrent out of a file that contains document_data_and_date_hash.
3. Seed torrent and announce it to bittorrent DHT network along with several torrent trackers. Publish .torrent in all major torrent indexes.
You're done. For free. You don't need to pay anyone to do this, you just need to run this algorithm by all interested parties on a simple app that uses libtorrent for all of the above. With enough peers running it, you have your proof of existence data seeded and indexed.

not sure why the hate against java, probably ignorance.
Java is hundreds of times faster than Python (which seems to be the preferred language of many projects in the bitcoin community) and that matters very much on a p2p network, it's rock solid, proven to scale, there's plenty of mature libraries so you don't have to waste time solving problems that don't concern your project, and development time is perhaps faster than with Python if you use the right IDE (like IntelliJ) as type safety will save you from unforeseen runtime errors and from writing lots of ridiculous type checking unit tests.

there's already a decentralized index of magnet links... it's called the Mainline DHT and there's an endless number of torrent indexes crawling it.
dead on arrival with the alt-coin thing, too much trouble to publish content, and you still need seeds.
and no way you can fit a whole magnet link in just 80 bytes. Just the infohash alone takes 20 bytes. Also, until we don't significantly raise block size we don't want to be putting crap on bittorrent transactions. When we're able to raise the block size to several gigs, perhaps we could think of having that arbitrary data field hold more info, but with an average of 250bytes per transactions, we can barely do a MERE 4,000 transactions every 10 minutes.

@_date: 2015-09-22 00:07:18
my guess is that they could use a federated blockchain and keep it open for people to transact and query on it, just keep the mining portion protected so that only miners from an association of worldwide bankers can be the only ones mining the blocks, everyone if free to join as an SPV node, or even have a copy of the full chain if they wanted to. 
The crypto-banking-federation could always decide wether to mine more or less tokens to represent value being transfered, while keeping it very scalable.

[The solution is simple and elegant]( it assumes no knowledge of the future, it allows the network to process these surges without backlogs and then reduces the blocksize limit to what is truly necessary.

they can be increased, yes, Gavin has done tests with 20Mb, but that still falls very short for the amount of transactions people think Bitcoin is able to do (lots of evangelist out there feeding bullshit to a lot of people). We need several gigs worth of blocksize to have Bitcoin be THE decentralized transactional network we all dream of.
The internet needs to be faster as a whole for Bitcoin to compete as a truly decentralized network. As of now, it will be done as best as we can by having lots of transactions silos outside the blockchain.
Also, try to get everyone to upgrade to a version of the protocol that enables huge blocksizes... good luck with that.
We need gigabit everywhere where a full node/miner is running, and we need the storage and processing power to crunch all of those transactions fast enough. Maybe 4-6 more years, counting on Moore's law and we might be there.

So why not do this "sustainable ad-free web experience" without the hardware?
This looks like an important mission for the FOSS community.
We need the following:
1. An HTTP-header based micropayment protocol for web browsers to send micropayments to headers that support it.
`Payments-Accepted: application/bitcoin-payment-requests`
2. C/C++ implementation for web servers that can be easily be integrated at the web server level via module. Think an apache module, nginx module, lighttpd module that you activate and configure on your web server's configuration. Basically it implements the functionality of an advanced micro-payment receiving wallet for each VirtualHost configured on the server.
3. Web Browser integration. Hopefully someone out there is already working on submitting beautiful patches that enable Chrome and Firefox with their own wallets, it'd be a matter of implementing 1. so that it can talk to micro-payment compatible web servers. As you browse and as you're about to enter a website, you could get a notification at the top (kind of when sites want access to your location, or your camera, etc.) letting you know that this website accepts N satoshis per page load for an ad-free experience,


Something along those lines would be pretty awesome, and help put a dent on Google's all powerful internet ad-monopoly.
Then instead of paying 21inc $400 to mine, you simply load your browser's wallet and you're good to go.

This demonstrates Andrea's vision of Bitcoin.
One on which Bitcoin serves only as the foundation, the internal pipeline for making the existing financial/banking networks more efficient through the use of a limited sized blockchain that only big banks will be able to afford to transact on..., and hopefully that will cause them to serve the other 6 billion electronic banking services...? Not sure how Bitcoin will affect the lives of so much people without those off-chain brokers not being intervened by greed.
I rather have a future, where we get to scale it, and people can simply install wallets and immediatly have banking services that belong to nobody, kind of like today, but let's give that to everybody.
I also hope I don't end up using 10,000 different coins  from 10,000 different sidechains, it'd be a lot easier if we could all use a world wide electronic token... like Bitcoin today, just at a larger scale.

in this context is far from silly. If within a year, Openbazaar gets to have over 100k stores, and millions of buying customers, Openbazaar could crash the Bitcoin network singlehandedly.
Just 4000 transactions per 10 minute block (~1MB) is all we can handle.
OpenBazaar does not do any off-chain transactions AFAIK, if a few stores start getting a lot of popularity, our success could be a big problem for Bitcoin.
What will happen if OpenBazaar transactions start to eat up the 10min transaction limit, and shitload of other transactions don't make it to the block...? what happens then to tx fees? they go through the roof?
In anycase, I'm glad we're far from there, but it's not a silly concern.

because you can let people query the blockchain and transact on that blockchain.
the blockchain doesn't need to be private, the only thing that needs to be restricted is the mining.
everyone goes on it in SPV mode basically.
@_date: 2015-09-15 00:41:07
so if you had a bigger block you'd have more transactions, meaning more fees. currently the block is so tiny the only thing supporting miners is the coinbase subsidy. you want bigger blocks however you look at it.

1. Giving everybody the same benefits (and more) than those given by Bitcoin.
2. Lowering their costs and making their settlement systems way more efficient.
As things like Bitcoin get more ground, they have no choice but to innovate and upgrade their inner systems, we're just showing them how to do it with blockchain technology.
You guys keep calling it a "private" blockchain, it doesn't need to be private, it just needs to have certified miners, but you can keep all the other benefits of letting people query and transact on those chains, and in the process they could even figure out a way to get rid of volatility by pegging the value of their tokens to USD.
Bitcoin would have a hard time competing against such a thing.

you'll just get audited, and if you didn't report your bitcoin income, you'll be in huge trouble. In the US, income is to be reported, no matter how you get paid, if you get paid in Chicken, it's still income, and you will be taxed on the USD value.
The way to do your reporting, as of now, report the transactions at the weighted average exchange rate of that day when you do your accounting. There's historical data on prices you will have to look up.
If you use a wallet like Bitcoin-Core, just export all your transactions to a .csv file, and multiply the amounts for the exchange rate of the day to do your accounting properly.

the thing is that there is very little available for purchase with Bitcoin, OpenBazaar guys are working hard on changing that.
Once you can purchase more goods and services, Bitcoin instantly becomes more useful, useful currencies are the ones that are accepted by most people, you wouldn't take some weird african currency as a form of payment, to you it'd be useless, therefore less valuable. We need to give Bitcoin utility, but again, we're still in baby stage to make such claims. I think it's infinitely superior as a form of payment, I enjoy buying with Bitcoin online when I have the chance, so much easier, also I use it as a form of payment to people abroad, no questions asked, like sending a message and my business is taken care of right from wherever I am at nearly 0 cost, not sure how that can be a dead payment system any time soon, it's barely being born!!!!.
as for americans, your logic makes sense, but much of the rest of the world can't do e-commerce because they don't have credit cards, and Bitcoin is getting there, in countries like Venezuela people are mining it, selling it, getting paid in BTC from abroad, and they're starting to sell things online for bitcoin through facebook groups.
it just needs to be more convenient and ubiquitious as an accepted form of payment online. but it's good actually that it hasn't been adopted that much as it would collapse if it were (3tx/sec only)

Dear OP, please expand, very vague, you don't say exactly why it became the only way for some people to do legitimate business, could you give us examples of the hundreds of thousands of people you mention using Bitcoin to do business today?
In my experience, writers that work with us in latin american countries have found it essential for 2 years now as it's the only way I have to pay them and they can redeem the fiat equivalent in their local exchanges. I'm not sure if there's hundred's of thousands of them yet.

@_date: 2015-09-14 19:53:21
no, it hasn't. If you run a full node, you need the entire 47Gb of blockchain, and so does every other node that wants to validate it.
That's extremely innefficient, it will not scale.
I'm talking about a different way to store transactions, a way that's more efficient and on which each new peer that comes to the network will actually be able to contribute and have an incentive for doing so.

you can always turn off mining. The interesting portion here is the whole buying/selling API calls, which I believe shouldn't need hardware, so the hardware would be mostly (at the current price of Bitcoin, if price goes up, then your ROI concern goes away) to have a full node, and who knows what other tricks they have up their sleeve.
this company kind of scares me, they have so many influential contacts, they're looking to establish a standard high level API for Bitcoin that depends solely on them, which isn't good for Bitcoin's decentralization, then it will be 21Inc's Bitcoin, it'll sort of Become the Google of Bitcoin that gets to dictate what everyone can and cannot do (like google and their ad monopoly and how they act like bullies censoring content and mandating censorship or otherwise "we screw you if you don't follow", apps and software that doesn't go along with their plans)

Don't you think Lightning is actually detrimental to mining incentives.
As you have less rewards per block and as you have more people transacting on blocks that are becoming full, you will be tempted to move most transactions off-chain with lightning, which means less fees for miners, then miners will instead want to run lightning nodes and will have to charge you for opening channels to keep those servers up.
OB at this point is interested in having a working product. I'm sure those interested in adding layers of privacy will be able to do so. Hopefully with something better than government's Tor. I2P would make more sense IMO as OB uses a lot of UDP.
I understand the motivation for decentralization, but my point is that people will not care about much of that if they got to see what banks could be capable off if they actually tried to offer what Bitcoin can already do for us today.

So quick back of the envelop math (without Seg-Wit)
255 bytes on average per transaction * 1000 tx * 60 seconds * 10 minutes =&gt; 153Mb/block.
Let's say you save about 50% with seg-wit rolled out, you'd need half of that =&gt; 76Mb/block.
So on the worst year...
144 full blocks per day on average * 365 days = 52,650 blocks per year * 76Mb/block =&gt; 500 gigs... peanuts, 
even without seg-wit, you only need 1Tb a year for that level of transaction, worst case scenario.
hardly, storage is cheap even for today's standards.
And it will be precisely all the Bitcoin companies that would sprung exponentially once you have that kind of transaction volume ocurring the ones that will run full nodes. If you have a Bitcoin business where you need to perform queries on the blockchain, it's in your best interest keeping local copies of the blockchain to provide a faster service, it's also in your interest that the chain keeps its integrity.
Satoshi him/her/themselve said it. We never expected regular users to keep a copy of the blockchain, that's nonsense.

yes, get an account on a good exchange and learn about Limit/Stop orders and other types of orders they support.
Those are not features of Coinbase and Circle, because those aren't exchanges, those are simple retail services. With an exchange you can buy and sell as much bitcoin as you can without waiting for bank settlement, it works very differently, you first deposit either an amount of bitcoin, or fiat into your account, and once that's been settled there, then you start trading within their system (not on chain) as fast as you can, whenever you want to cash out, you either withdraw bitcoins to an external wallet, or you ask for a withdrawal to your bank which takes time.
with coinbase/circle, you get charged for every purchase, or whenever you sell you get that balance in fiat (on their systems) and then you do a withdrawal. coinbase and circle are for casual buyers, exchanges are for people who want to trade larger amounts or who want to make money by speculating and they support what you ask and way more.

Not so much a "private" blockchain, what they want is a federated blockchain on which mining nodes are only the ones owned by all banks.
You want to keep the "federated chain" public so that you can allow users to query and transact on the blockchain.

You want to put your transaction on the blockchain but you cant because they have decided to keep blocks too small, you offer to pay more to get your existing transaction to be included.

[This is how I think banks should do it]( it'd be efficient and it would provide all the benefits plus non-price volatility. Also it wouldn't be private, it would be an open, yet federated blockchain. Think [Bitcoin-NG]( but instead of anybody being able to mint key-blocks, it's only the banks that can do so, yet everyone can download the blockchain, query it, inspect it and transact in it as long as they have valid coins and wallets.
Why wouldn't banks want to do this and take over all the disruption Bitcoin could have if it were to scale and be adopted worldwide?

LOL, however, having dynamic doubling and halfing of mining difficulty doesn't concern anybody, I guess everyone is happily GPU mining today...
I think it's actually very very conservative and won't solve anything if we get real adoption. 8mb, or 16mb blocks can barely hold any transactions if Bitcoin were to be adopted, and block increases are nothing but a temporary solution, not a solution for scalability and truly making Bitcoin a superior option.
And lightning ... i'll have to see it to believe it, I think it's detrimental to mining incentives when you take transactions out of the blockchain, if it even works, it will be the wild west of transaction fees in there.

Keep laughing but until we can scale the man is very right.
Bitcoin couldn't even be adopted by a mall right now, remember, just 7tx/sec, even if we raised blocks to 10Mb, we'd have a mere 70tx/sec, nothing, easily collapsable with any real world use. We need gigabyte sized block capacity for this thing to happen, the internet is not ready for that, and it's just unscalable under the current model, even if we wanted to we couldn't scale with the current blockchain distribution model.
Bitcoin is depressingly small if you are objective about it. A few of us might be bathed in it, but that only makes it an experimental currency.

BIP 101 is a joke too. The transactional rate achieved would be still too low for a worldwide open digital cash network (that also wants to be everything else)
It assumes Bitcoin transactional volume can be guessed and that a simple doubling starting at 8mb per block will suffice. So you go from 7tx/sec (1Mb), to 56tx/sec (8mb), then 2 years... at a mere 56tx/sec? you kidding me? then 112tx/sec (16mb ~ 2017) still a joke, then 224tx/sec (32mb~2019) still a joke for transactional purposes specially entering the world of the 2020s, with gigabit connections.
You can't guess volume demand (what happens if some super popular musician decides to do a concert sale on Bitcoin and we're still at 16mb per block 4 years in... it fucks everyone else that day/week), a single product could demand 1000tx/sec. so BIP 101 would still fall short on its ass. You could instead make Bitcoin churn to the maximum of the network's capabilities, but still that wouldn't be sufficient because the system requires every full node to have a full copy, this is unscalable as it is, you need a major architectural shift on how you distribute the blockchain, there needs to be a way on which you just get portions of it with enough redundancy that you can query the parts you need only when you need them.

A multisig (as in multiple-signature) address can only move funds out if N of M signers sign on the transaction, that's the gist of it.
Some examples:
Mom, Dad and Kid have a 2 of 3 multisig address.
Mom and Dad fund the address with $50 worth of BTC so Kid can spend in the mall.
Kid can only spend money if Mom or Dad signs on the transaction too.
John and Paul have a 2 of 2 multisig address to hold a large portion of their business funding money. The money can only leave the address if both agree. (a PITA if there's a disagreement)
You have a network of 10 Bitcoin ATMs. Instead of assigning each ATM a funding address (to replenish the BTC), you can setup a 1 of 10 multisig address, you just fund the multisig address and you're all done funding all of your ATMs in one step. Each ATM can dispense funds, as you only need 1 signature of the possible 10.

As long as Bitcoin can't scale, there will be centralized servers holding bitcoins for users and doing transactions within their databases.
When Bitcoin can scale to billions of transactions per day, people should not accept depositing bitcoin to sites, and they will want bitcoin addresses for every transaction.
In a way he is right, at the moment the product is flawed, and it is still an experiment when compared to things like visa, mastercard, western union. We can barely do 67 transactions per second, or 4000 transactions per minute witht he current block size, and we wont be able to scale to accomodate all of internet's commercial transactions until we make the blocksize go from the mere 1 megabyte limit we have now, up to several gigs (estimating a small transaction size of 250 bytes on average)
That means all miners need to have gigabit connections first... so that gives you an idea when bitcoin will truly be ready to compete as a platform on its own. in the meantime we are stuck with the likes of centralized services that can go bust, sued out of business, regulated out of business, hacked, or simply take off with people's money.

I wouldn't bet much on this project. It seems like it's just a bunch of unclear ideas and questions with no real answers with a lot of naive technological assumptions.
I don't think this project has the right team or direction after seeing him present at the SF Bitcoin meetup.
He wants to monetize the protocol, as in getting a cut from every paid upvote (big mistake from a liability perspective) and he says that his client would censor content.
This would make him liable for things like criminal copyright infringement as people would post copyrighted contents (think a New York Times article) and then would make money on the upvotes, while the official Datt team would monetize a portion of the upvotes...  so you ask them about this, and they say they'd censor that content in their client to avoid the liability... I don't know how is this solving anything if you have control of the content on a portion of the network as you introduce partial censorship, and the development team is liable for all sorts of things.
Good heart, but it seems they still have a lot to figure out and need quite a bit of help.

@_date: 2015-03-22 16:48:27
Let me explain off-chain with an example.
You sign up to a centralized online service, say a gambling website.
You deposit your Bitcoins to an address they give you.
Now your account has a "Balance"
They have your bitcoins, but you have a "withdrawal" button somewhere around there.
You start playing, betting, losing, winning.
All those transactions DO NOT happen on the blockchain, it's just updates on their database, taking balance from one user to another, probably taking fees.
At the moment of withdrawal, they check your balance, if you have enough funds on their database, they then send you the bitcoin to your withdrawal address. The only on-chain transactions would be the deposit and the withdrawal.
The one benefit of off-chain transactions is that Bitcoin currently cannot support a large number of transactions (tops ONLY about 4,000 transactions every 10 minutes, def. not enough for a world wide network, so the only way to go now to scale is having services with lots of transactional volume go off-chain)
The risk, is that the service holding the bitcoins can get hacked, or can run away with the bitcoins (like Mt.Gox)

You guys are stuck on the bitcoin system design and can't see past other possibilities.

@_date: 2015-11-19 04:40:29
you don't completely remove PoW, you have to mine that key block but you send it right away without any other transactions except for your coinbase tx. Now you don't wait to add the incoming transactions to the blockchain while you're doing the work (everyone starts getting their transactions confirmed almost right away). You do the work, and that work gives you the authority to sign transactions as fast as agreed by the network (there's a microblock rate and size too), so with this you minimize latency issues, and you use the network to the maximum of its capabilities. 
Seems to me waaaay better than what we have now.

Tokens are generated by bankers, the same way they generate electronic tokens today to represent the account balance on your checking account. If they have the power to do that today, they should have the power to move the existing value represented in today's account into that blockchain.
Once a token is created and moved around the blockchain it can always be tracked to the moment it was added to the chain.
And yes, read the post again, I'm moving trust back into banks, or you think banks are going to just let go of the power they have as centralized trust entities?
I'm just making a case that if banks got their shit together and gave us blockchain capabilities to openly transact, while keeping trust in their hands, people would dismiss Bitcoin as it would be an inferior option.
If Bitcoin gets to scale, then that's another story and the next issues to solve are volatility, fungibility and regulation.

Money is simply an exchangeable token to represent value/trust.
If I somehow could convince you that crayons would be money, and got you to give me something for a crayon. Then you'd try to do the same to somebody else.
The moment you have enough people exchanging crayons over value, you have yourself a currency.
In Bitcoin what happens is that you will try to mint your own Bitcoins, and after months of wasting electricity and generating shit, you end up believing that it's just better to pay for it, when that happens, Bitcoin has become money. Bitcoin is infinitely better than crayons since it's impossible to counterfeit, you can keep it forever without it rotting, and you can send it instantly for almost no cost.

you need to understand that even though fiat is centralized, you can have thousands of atms that can all join an open, decentralized exchange that presents the fiat as another altcoin. you would go to Acme ATM, deposit your fiat, atm validates it is legitimate, and then it assigns sends you a certain amount of colored satoshis that represent that fiat, or it is exchanged for some altcoin that represents that fiat. With things like counterparty it has been proven you can then do decentralized exchanges of digital currencies/assets.  it so can be done, but you need to get all atm operators to be part of a standard, open, decentralized exchange network. the atms are you decentralized points of deposit and withdrawal.

the challenges are the ones you mention. plus finding a designer that actually gets the user experience (not just looks) is expensive/hard, those guys are usually very busy and doing cool things. Most talented people are already busy and are well paid, at this point Bitcoin is probably very small to reach their ears.
Eventually one of those guys who is a talented coder with the blessing of having also a feel and know how for user experience and ui design will decide to either collaborate with a wallet project or will also happen to have the time and/or money to start a new wallet company that gets users that care about having an electronic wallet. 
Will make a fiat-comes-first user experience that everyone understands (my mom doesnt have a clue what a BTC 0.003432 amount represents in worth, nor she cares, show her fucking $s!),  with NFC integration as the default way to interact (and QR optional but easy to get to) for POS payments or phone to phone transactions.

that first, they need to know about Coinbase, and second they might not trust it. They can already buy tens of thousands (perhaps more) different symbols and funds with their current trading platforms, if they could just do the same for Bitcoin it'd be great, they already have all that shit setup for trading in a heavily regulated environment.
Now you will get a lot of curious buyers without much hassle. It's way way way more convenient if you can buy/sell it like another symbol in the real markets, where so much liquidity is available.
If you try to buy Bitcoins on Coinbase and you get the value of your money a week later, that's not very attractive to someone who's used to putting orders of 100k and seeing them execute in less than 1 second.
I truly hope that these funds will attract so much money that a little group of Bitcoin traders won't be able to manipulate the price as easily as they can do it today. More volume from a huge marketplace will mean less volatility.

but it's an open system and nobody can stop people from using the chain. Bitcoin gets popular in just a single city and it's done for (unless it can scale).
you should try using bitcoin with people that actually need it, like in south america, specifically venezuela where their local currency has gone to shit and the government's USD reserves are a mere $500MM. 
This country should be of special interest, as not only they have this monetary situation, they have pretty much free electricity and the amount of people mining is growing rapidly by the month.
A lot of people are starting to try Bitcoin and they're liking it, if it starts to become a method of payment to circumvent the government's worthless fiat a city like Caracas alone might make fee pressure go up and lots of transactions to remain unconfirmed for days, which would then make people say "this shit doesn't work" and it will crash beautifully.
but right now, developers are in academic la-la land, thinking of artificial limits, instead of letting the network churn to the maximum of its capabilities, while companies whose best interests keep pushing for keeping the artificial limits, so you take your transactions off chain and into their centralized databases.
the market will tell.

I want my wallets to let me display all amounts in USD and hide the BTC values if possible.
Everyone understands USD amounts to give value to their work, products, services. If I need to pay someone $20 bucks, nowadays I have to take extra steps to enter the USD amount, USD should be the default if that's what I use the most.
When I see my transaction log on the wallet, I currently have no clue how much I spent, I'd like to see everything in USD, hide the BTC. Normal people don't give a shit about bitcoins since they don't earn or spend bitcoins and have no frame of comparison. Put that stuff in dollars, and they'll be all over it. The amounts on hot wallets are usually so small, that volatility is irrelevant by the time you spent the money, can you remember exactly how much cash you have on your regular wallet right now? I've no clue, so volatility wouldn't really that much of an issue, as sometimes it works in your favor.

On OB you transact directly with the other person, each one runs an app, no website in between. 
**OB goes through the open internet if you run it out of the box.**
***OB is not meant and was not designed for illegal use***, OB is meant to decentralize e-commerce which represents a multibillion dollar industry that could grow even further in cash based nations, who don't yet have a clue what it's like to live with services like Amazon or Ebay.
**OB will be a significant job creator in developing nations** (and I hope it pushes the developer community [to scale the fuck out of bitcoin]( because every transaction will need to occur on chain)
it will be very easy to get caught if you go out there to do illegal transactions. Do not use OB for illegal activity, instead put up a store and sell all the things people can't buy with Bitcoin, you will make way more money.

it's not a great store of value if it's so volatile (only for those that mined at the beginning, if I were to spend the bitcoins I bought at 900 id'be fucked, so not such a great store of value unless I can one day break even). theorically it is (if it can scale and not crash completely when the next generation cryptocurrency kills it), in practice right now it's nothing more than a speculative asset.

BIP 101 is a joke too. The transactional rate achieved would be still too low for a worldwide open digital cash network (that also wants to be everything else)
It assumes Bitcoin transactional volume can be guessed and that a simple doubling starting at 8mb per block will suffice. So you go from 7tx/sec (1Mb), to 56tx/sec (8mb), then 2 years... at a mere 56tx/sec? you kidding me? then 112tx/sec (16mb ~ 2017) still a joke, then 224tx/sec (32mb~2019) still a joke for transactional purposes specially entering the world of the 2020s, with gigabit connections.
You can't guess volume demand (what happens if some super popular musician decides to do a concert sale on Bitcoin and we're still at 16mb per block 4 years in... it fucks everyone else that day/week), a single product could demand 1000tx/sec. so BIP 101 would still fall short on its ass. You could instead make Bitcoin churn to the maximum of the network's capabilities, but still that wouldn't be sufficient because the system requires every full node to have a full copy, this is unscalable as it is, you need a major architectural shift on how you distribute the blockchain, there needs to be a way on which you just get portions of it with enough redundancy that you can query the parts you need only when you need them.

You're absolutely right. If we had capacity, we'd have more transactional volume, more transactional volume more people going in and out of the markets making price stable. More price stability more capital saved on bitcoin instead of bank accounts, more useful money, more valuable money.
it does care, just look at the overall market cap and how bitcoin is already less than 50% of it.

Any mention would have serious implications, from market speculation, to more mainstream attention we DON'T NEED until scalability is figured out, all the way to a possible legion of FB App developers starting to have more and more ideas on how to badly integrate Bitcoin into facebook most likely with on-chain transactions , , if just a single crappy FB app goes viral the blockchain would probably collapse.
If I were him, I'd probably be watching it every now and then while having my people keep tabs on it with regards to any news about scalability in the horizon while I develop a financial platform for FB that's agnostic of the underlying payment system. Just like Microsoft didn't let the hardware makers dictate the industry by selling their software on multiple hardwares, and how FB is device independent, they will probably have the same approach on letting people transact.
Bitcoin will probably be just one more of the services a FB wallet will have, if it can scale that is. In the meantime no need to taint your name with what could be empty promises and a lot of bad history. Not necessary for him at the time.

So if you were to distribute 13 million users evenly across 30 days, you have 433.333k users which could pay for their bill on any given day.
The bitcoin blockchain can only handle about 4,000 transactions every 10 minutes.
The day has 1,440 minutes, so we have only about 144 blocks x 4,000 transactions, that's only about 576,000 transactions we can handle per day.
If those customers decided to go for that 20% credit, which hopefully they won't, they'd eat up  75% of all the available transaction space...
Good thing that this is an impossible scenario for now, otherwise we'd fuck the whole Bitcoin thing before it happens. Exponential adoption is my biggest fear at this point where the internet is so slow and the blocksize so tiny.

"It costs a regular bitcoin transaction fee for every token transaction or issuance."
does this mean that these tokens are even less scalable in terms of transactions per second than Bitcoin? According to what you said, it sounds like you're using whatever little space is left on the block to perform these transactions, this doesn't make much sense in terms of scalability, or does counterparty create a separate blockchain for each token issued?

If you multiply a number by a prime number (prime factor), you will only be able to obtain the original number by dividing by the prime factor.
Since there's no formula to generate prime numbers, if you grab a big number and mutiply it by a huge prime, it's really hard to guess what the factor is unless you try to divide by all the possible primes until you find the large prime, make the number long enough and it could take centuries for a computer to find it.
So, simplifying... to get a close mental model of pair key encryption, you could think of these numbers as your public and private key. (that's at least how I understand it, but of course, [there's a lot more operations involved when it comes to key generation](

it's funny that the one company that acts pretty much the way LN would work (2nd-layer scalability only centralized, like a LN hub would in practice to an end user, and probably with a better user experience, actually functional today, and with a credit card you can actually use!) is begging for 8x blocksize increase, the ones actually letting regular people move money on Bitcoin, immediatly gets shutdown.
it's funny that there's 150k transactions backlogged at a rate of up to 3 transactions per second, and people still don't get that we need to stop the bleeding before we make an organ transplant.
This religious debate will kill Bitcoin, the miners already said on which side they're on, the people actually putting real money, employing others, giving you credit cards so you actually spend bitcoins and bring more capital into the market, people taking actual risks and people physically running the damn thing being shut down. what a brain wash blockstream has done, they destroyed Bitcoin's community spirit in the process too.
No matter how many optimizations you make, you will need a bigger block size.

We're now at 883MB, and it has no sign of stopping.
This is happening just hours before Gemini opens for trading. (tomorrow at 09:30 EDT)
Gemini's timeframe to register and validate a bank account has left people not willing to make a Wire transfer today without USD liquidity until friday, which is when ACH's sent this afternoon would make it to Gemini. Therefore, people funding their accounts with ACH transfer have no option but to fund their accounts with BTC for sale.
If a small group of individuals have USD liquidity to purchase Bitcoin, the BTC supply will be higher than the demmand, which would naturally send the price downwards.
Now back to the mempool possibly going past 2GB if the attack continues until 9:30am tomorrow (does somebody know what the default maximum number of transactions for bitcoind is?, we're currently at about 64,000 tx), if it starts having a very negative effect on the network's performance, or if it starts making a large number of nodes crash, somebody is going to buy a lot of Bitcoin real cheap tomorrow morning amidst a bunch of negative headlines about a Bitcoin Network crash.

it is better if you only keep block/coin minting private (federated) but keep all the other benefits of peemissionless transactions a blockchain does.

@_date: 2016-05-20 12:12:40
The problem with the thunder/lightning network is that it eventually eliminates the incentive for mining blocks if you move the majority of transactions out of the blockchain, when block rewards are close to zero there won't be any fees to collect if everyone is going off chain, then what's the point of the blockchain. Also, who will regulate the cost of using that network, node operators will compete on a market basis which will bring huge centralization once the likes of corporate giants realize they can have valuable information in their hands by routing these payments. Centralization will mean censorship.
It is not Bitcoin, it's a trap.

Yes, it is possible.
After [asking some questions to Bitcoin Developers]( we think we have a clear way of doing it using micropayment channels.
The way we propose it works is done when the content creator creates a torrent.
By Content Creator I mean a Musician, Film maker, Book author, Software Developer willing to sell content on the BitTorrent network.
When the content creator creates the torrent, it specifies the payment address, and it also specifies a revenue sharing rate for Seeders, as well as a Bitcoin tx fee so we don't end up with a bunch of Bittorrent related transactions being added to the blockchain days later.
When someone wants to download a torrent, it will negotiate with seeders for the torrent pieces it will ask for, the negotiation terms will be done through a micropayment channel and refund transactions which will get diminished as the pieces arrive and their hashes are verified (as specified in the .torrent file).
As an example, the content creator could specify sharing 5% of each piece sent with the seeder that helped distribute the files. 95% would go to the content creator, and 5% to that seeder.
This is a proposal to incentivize legal file sharing on the Bittorrent network. We believe piracy isn't going anywhere, but it is mitigated when you give people convenient and legal options to get paid content.
You as a downloader could always create a new torrent that shares the file for free, but I believe you will have a bigger incentive of becoming a seeder of the legal torrent so that you can earn some money back by sharing.
**Bitcoin might not be ready for the volume of transactions we might create though...**
One of our biggest concerns with this, after talking to Bitcoin developers, is that we think the Blockchain is not ready for the amount of transactions we could potentially bring, so maybe it'd be wise to wait until Bitcoin has a larger blocksize (like the 20MB tests they were doing) and can at least process 8000 transactions per minute, currently the Bitcoin blockchain can do only handle about 400 transactions per minute, given it has a mere 1mb sized block -&gt; 1Mb/250 bytes per transaction = Max ~4000 transactions in ~10 minutes =&gt; ~400 tx/min, which is nothing, if Bitcoin were to be adopted today in all of NYC it would probably collapse every morning when people are buying coffee and breakfast, 400 tx per minute is nothing.
What core developers will tell you at this point in time, is that if you have a high transaction volume, take it off the blockchain (centralize it basically), that's not something we could do in the case of Bittorrent transactions as Bittorrent is a distributed system and we wouldn't like to have anything to do as developers with the transactions people make on the network, meaning, we wouldn't host this transactions for anything in the world, it'd be too much liability as it is expected that some people will try to truly pirate content and sell stuff they have not created, not to mention the possibility of selling illegal files on the network. So, since we can't take our transactions off the blockchain anytime soon, we'll have to wait for Bitcoin to scale.
So... no rush to build this at the moment, we think it would only make Bitcoin collapse, and that wouldn't be good for anybody.

banks don't need to waste computing power to mint a block, all they need is to have a list of federated keys, and any bank in the federation can mint new blocks (or key blocks) and sign as fast as their computing power allows them, thus enabling hundreds of thousands of transactions per second, in the open.

usually the premium you pay for being able to take the money out faster, meaning, the one of the two where it's easier to access your fiat will be the most expensive one.
If you find a way to move the money out of the hard one and sell at a higher price on the other one, then you'll understand why you can get away with this arbitrage, there's a risk you incur by going into the cheaper exchange and you make others pay for it, that's what I call the arbitrage premium.

is there a way to make this wallet work displaying amounts only in fiat? (I don't care for volatility in my hot wallet, I don't keep more than $100 at the time in there and I can't hardly remember how much money I have left anyways...) 
I rarely enter amounts in BTC when I use Mycelium, when I pay people we always deal in USD and those are the amounts I need to send, all my transactions are usually dollar based.

keep underestimating...
Those chains don't need to be 100% private. Only Block generation needs to be federated by bank's mining rigs. 
If so they wanted, they could let anyone download their blockchain, query it, transact on it, all the benefits of permissionless money transfers (with all fees going to them), just having a wallet generated by them. and then what? Imagine having all the benefits to the consumer we have with bitcoin, plus scalability and no volatility...
keep underestimating. Not sure what's so hard to see here. Banks might be able to make Bitcoin obsolete if they release at the right time.

why do you assume they already haven't figured this out?
Blockchain without mining doesn't mean you have to keep access to the blockchain private.
You're just taking trust, from the many (miners) to a smaller federated group (banks), but you could keep all the benefits of permissionless transactions and querying the blockchain has.

Any mention coming from him would mean FB is working on it, but FB can't even touch it given how unscalable Bitcoin is, a mere test would probably collapse the Bitcoin network at this moment.
If Bitcoin doesn't fix its scalability issues they'll probably continue to pull the trigger with their own world wide payment system, and once that's rolled out, convenient and available to everyone you know, Bitcoin will be a very hard sell.

So I've been told that the transactions in the mempool consist of those whose fees were too low in comparison to the ones miners picked.
There's about BTC 80,000 on the mempool right now, I suppose those are those "(pending)" for all that people, and they'll be like that for about a week then.
That's like USD $19.5MM on hold for 7 days, and growing.
Also, all those transactions, as low as the included fees were, make up for BTC 10.89 in pending fees as well.

8MB + segwit =&gt; how many tx per block would that be?
About 2-3 years ago Gavin proved we could easily handle 20Mb blocks..., the 8mb proposal was a modest one.
and [we actually need 15GB blocks]( (2 year old piece, still valid), but people seem to think it will always be 2017 and have not heard of the 5G Internet features** and beyond.
Meanwhile people keep sending 3Mb .gif files just for fun, and we're fighting here about stuffing transactions of an open world wide transfer network and some morons still think we should limit our selves to a mere 1Mb every 10 minutes, madness.
# 5G Internet features
    According to the Groupe Speciale Mobile Association (GSMA) to qualify for a 5G a connection 
    should meet most of these eight criteria:
   1. One to 10Gbps connections to end points in the field
   2. One millisecond end-to-end round trip delay 
   3. 1000x bandwidth per unit area
   4. 10 to 100x number of connected devices
   5. (Perception of) 99.999 percent availability
   6. (Perception of) 100 percent coverage
   7. 90 percent reduction in network energy usage
   8. Up to ten-year battery life for low power, machine-type devices
But sure, let's keep drinking blockstream's 1Mb blocks so they can turn Bitcoin into SWIFT and monetize from the problem they're creating.

not until it can scale.
To stabilize you need a bigger market, you can't achieve that big of a market unless a lot of people can accept and use bitcoin to pay for retail.
If you had the possibility to have millions or tens of transactions per day ON-CHAIN, this would let Bitcoin be useful and valuable. There would orders of magnitude of value going in and out of exchanges because of necessity from retailers and people, when such volume surpasses many times over the amount of bitcoins being traded by sole speculators, then you'll achieve stability, if you achieve stability then there's no need to have saving accounts which would drive even more people to bitcoin, then the rest is history.
but if it can't scale... forget about it.

if Popcorn Time were a company that would seek to license directly from independent producers, this would be awesome.
As it is, doing such thing would probably fuck everything for the Bittorrent ecosystem who has worked very hard for the past 10 years to legitimize itself as this would promote massive CRIMINAL copyright infringment, sharing would no longer be a civil offense in most jurisdictions, now people would be truly stealing.
Piracy will never go away, but this technology needs to be used in a way that makes sense for content producers as well, otherwise a lot of people will actually end up going to jail for selling films they don't have a right to sell.
We at FrostClick and FrostWire have been working on using BitTorrent + Creative Commons since 2006 (we invented the Bittorrent Bundle) and have managed to drive millions of legal downloads by promoting this free content free of charge to indie bands, writers (even [Paulo Coehlo worked with us]( using Creative Commons), and [film makers]( We've also [integrated Bitcoin/Bittorrent Tipping into our torrent client]( and we think the way to do this with micropayment channels, is to create an easy to use platform where bands, film makers, writers and other digital content creators can upload content to a service that creates signed torrents which specify what rev.share % of each sale goes to seeders.
Your .torrent metadata would include the desired fiat price (so torrent clients can negotiate an initial price at the moment of the download using an average bitcoin market price), when micropayment channels are opened, one is always opened to pay the content creator, while the rev.share % specified in the torrent is the amount of bitcoin paid to seeders as chunks are sent.
Letting people get paid for seeding left and right this way is in my opinion as a Bittorrent developer very irresponsible.

any business idea you have in Venezuela is a bad idea.
You can't do business in a country whose government is very efficient at destroying capital to impose a castro-communist order where nobody owns anything and the government owns everything.
It's only a matter of time until you get caught, you'd have to do the whole thing in absolute secrecy, which is practically impossible in a country where people are so nosy.
Then you have to deal with crime, not getting the equipment stolen, and not getting killed over it.
And then even if the electricity is cheap, how do you deal with not being able to mine for 5 hours at the time when the electricity goes out, which tends to go out for hours at the time almost every day?
To give you a reality shock...
How the hell do you plan to smuggle the mining equipment?
Did you know that if you get caught simply by moving a box of diapers, or toilet paper, the police can say that you're a "smuggler" and they can simply throw you in jail without due process? (The government has regulated prices on everything and killed all production of goods, now that the country has no USD to import things like it used to, there's massive scarcity of basic goods, the police steals from citizens, and all non-regulated business is considered "smuggling", it's a fucking nightmare, you can't trust anybody because they might be informing the government of what you're doing)
If you're still not convinced, think about the first thing the commmies did when they got in power, they implemented a very restrictive system of currency exchange controls, why? because they knew that without access to foreign currencies they'd have absolute power with their own currency, and secondly, because they'd be able to create a black market and make themselves rich as fuck in the process. Bitcoin goes directly against this method of population control, it's only a matter of time before they start talking about it in public and say that this is a technology created by the american empire, and if you are caught mining bitcoin you are a traitor to the revolution and the motherland and the supreme commander Chavez and blah blah blah (fucking communists...)
Don't do it dude, very bad idea.

you could mine a block and start mining the next one without publishing the first one (and risking someone else might find another one while you're holding back), if you're lucky (probably using machine learning to estimate the right timing), you can send the block waiting as much as possible (while still winning with the first block) and soon after have a more favorable position to find the next block (given you know which transactions you already picked from the mempool on the previous one, and you'll have the next block lined up)
@_date: 2015-10-31 03:20:25
right now you need miners to create blocks because we all agree that blocks have to have a special property, a special number in them that takes a lot of work to be found. Once this number is found, it's attached to the end of the new block with all the containing transactions and it is signed by the miner who now ads to himself the new bitcoins for that block. New bitcoins are created this way.
But you can change the rules, you can say that you don't need all of that work to create a new block, you can say that all you need is to have one of several known public keys to which only banks have private keys for.
This way you can mint blocks as fast as you can, pointing to the previous ones, and these blocks don't necessarily need to add new coins into the system, they can just contain the transactions that happened recently.
Every wallet joining the network abides by these public federated keys, if someone tries to add a block of their own and change a balance without having one of these keys every peer in the network simply ignores this block and keeps on churning.
No need to waste so much electricity, and you can have thousands of transactions per second.

Being Devil's Advocate:
You don't need the thousands of miners to keep the blockchain secure if you have a set of federated keys when it comes to block minting.
Banks could run a chains that mint coins pegged to different currencies. 
As bank customers transfer money from their checking accounts into their crypto wallets on the currency of their choice, once the banks can agree the money was moved out of their bank accounts (settled), that amount of new tokens is added to the next block and assigned to the different wallets that purchased them. The creation of the block would be done with a federated signature and the "coinbase" portion of that block would include the assigment of these tokens to all the wallets.
Their blockchains could be public in the sense that anybody could download it, anbody could create block explorers and all sorts of services and statistic gathering around it, anybody with a wallet could transact on it, scalably, you'd keep the most important benefits to end consumers. 
To end users, they don't even have to know the underlying mechanism is a top a blockchain, yet banks would enjoy the benefits of an ecosystem around their public chains, you're only taking the miner portion of things out of the equation. End users would just think banks have had this awesome innovations, as many of them wouldn't even had heard of or cared for Bitcoin.
If you don't mine bitcoin today, the only difference to you would be:
1. No volatility
2. You can transact all you want.
If you mine bitcoin today, the third difference would be:
3. You can't mine on these federated blockchains.
If BOFA, CHASE, CITI and Wells Fargo sat down on a table and agreed to this (which might be quite easy as these institutions might already be a monopoly with different faces), and gave their millions of users the ability to send money for very low fees, they'd increase the amount of transfers world wide, they'd collect all the fees, and the rest of the banks would have to join the chains and pay fees like us mortals, but they'd keep all the control of the chain.
only those who wouldn't want to use the bank system for whatever reasons would stick to Bitcoin which would remain a small unscalable experiment.

sadly as much as I thought like you, I realized Bitcoin can't really scale to compete with those companies unless third parties process a lot of the transactions off the blockchain, basically holding a bitcoin balance for you and trading internally between their users, and then at the end of the day moving the actual bitcoins.
the bitcoin blockchain isn't anywhere ready to support 1 million transactions per minute yet. The best we've done is an average of 73 transactions per minute and people are already complaining about block size reaching 1Mb, if we truly want to compete, we'll need to have blocks of several gigs and an internet fast enough to transmit those every 10mins, and mining power fast enough to verify all those hashes.

The attack is simple, in parallel, you make compliant, but EMPTY blocks (while you mine for the big block chain), which are easier/faster to make, and you send those to the core-abiding nodes in order to make them incapable of having any transaction confirmed for hours or days. 
Once you make the first empty block, if you make it fast enough, you start working on the subsequent empty blocks that link back to this one, and you time your block publishing so that you always win.

Checkout Seller.Trade, we built this during the Miami hackathon
Here's the source code
It currently runs well on OSX, we have binary issues running on Ubuntu (which is where we actually need it so you can just run this on a server and start selling)
As more nodes are fired up, more products become available, and search load is distributed among them.
Prices are set in fiat, no confusing volatility BS to deal with. Currently the only payment gateway it supports is Bitpay, but we'd like to add more, including paypal, because why not, all we want to provide is p2p ecommerce, consumers should be able to decide what to pay with, we don't have to use multisig so we are not tied to Bitcoin only.
As soon as I get a breather I'll make this run on Ubuntu and put out a beta installer to see how it goes.
We pulled this off in 16 hours during the miami hackathon. It's not regulation issues holding us back, just day to day life and work, being able to make the time to work on this.

Chinese Miners mine Bitcoin.
Chinese Miners against core have majority hashpower.
Chinese Miners could easily use a fraction of their hashpower to flood small block blockchain with empty blocks (this is why core was talking about changing PoW algorithm, good luck with that), when small block blockchain can't move a single transaction in mempool and network starts collapsing, people will have no choice but to move their bitcoins on the Chinese miner blockchain, hopefully you will have an exchange that supports such token.
Chinese Miners can easily meet outside US Jurisdiction and Collude to short the hell out of small block bitcoin while dumping all of it at the same time, and then wait for the demand of new big-block bitcoin to skyrocket past $3000 a pop.

this is very doable if a atm operators all become part of a decentralized, open, exchange network, which lets people buy the digital equivalent token of any fiat, it could be represented with colored satoshis, or with altcoins. then you can exchange digital tokens in a decentralized fashion as ot is been proven by counterparty.

more power to the chinese.
Bitcoin's power is centralized by the Chinese mining mafia. Even if the core devs agreed to raise the blocksize to 20Mb, in the end it's up to them to upgrade, doesn't matter how many full nodes there are, they're the ones minting every new block.

the bitcoin blocksize debate is not about the precision of bitcoin, it's about how many people can use bitcoin every 10 minutes.
Right now honey, only 2500 people could use bitcoin every 10 minutes, everybody else would have to wait.
If we want Bitcoin to be used worldwide, to be accepted just by a handful of popular websites it can't work with such a tiny blocksize. Several solutions exist but people are fighting way too much.
The blocksize could already be about 100Mb, you don't have to send the blocks when they're assembled, all you need to send is a compressed index of the transactions on the new block, most full nodes, already have received those transactions during the last minutes, whatever transactions you don't have once you receive that new block's index you can ask you neighbors saving tremendous bandwidth.
But the truth is, that Bitcoin is already very centralized by the miners. It doesn't matter how many full nodes there are, Bitcoins are generated by miners, it doesn't even matter if developers come out with solutions, miners can choose to keep the limit small and not update.
meanwhile more people will wake up

well it makes sense, the more the chinese mine, the less chance for others to earn any rewards, the bitcoin price isn't enough for them to cover their energy/equipment expenditure and when the halving comes, if there's a price surge it might not be enough, perhaps there will be a huge surge and then a nasty drop that will end things.
what we need is huge block so that miners can offset the diminished minting rewards with fees, but core...

it's because nobody had time enough to fund their accounts with USD. There's only like USD $6.5k on the buy side, and USD $63k (BTC 268) on the BTC sell side, so 10x more BTC supply than demand, guess what will happen to the price. 
If you have 27 BTC to sell, you can own the price on the buy side.
People only had time to fund their BTC wallets and not their USD funds.
I wonder if the short time between registration and launch today was intentional so this would happen, or simply an important oversight. Most bitcoiners will fund via ACH and will not do the Wire funding mechanism, too expensive.

Judging at the history of secret technologies developed by the US government, we're fucked if they wanted to shut down Bitcoin then.
The US government has always been way ahead of commercial technologic development, we had our first computers in the 1940s to develop the necessary calculations for atomic forces when building an atomic bomb, at the time most of the world was barely using planes for commercial flight,  and didn't even have a clue what a computer was...
Those guys probably have had working active Quantum computers able to break any non quantum-safe encryption out there, it's a matter of national security and supremacy, I don't see why not with such huge budgets and so much time to develop it since the 40s.

In my experience, running a full node is way more reliable when it comes to using Bitcoin.
After running Bitcoin-Core for over 2 years and starting to hurt due to an almost full hard drive I decided to give electrum a try.
In the past 2 months using it, I've had a week on which I couldn't open the client as it'd freeze synchronizing, and during the weekend I couldn't send bitcoins after the last update, which was fixed, after the fix, I had another issue that said my client was lagging two blocks and it wasn't until this morning that I could finally send my payments.
So, sure it might be lighter, but it isn't very reliable at this point in my personal experience.

I think when Bitcoin forks, people that want to play it safe will start selling and perhaps buying into the next best capitalized coin, Ethereum.

you seem to forget that what seems like a lot of storage and bandwidth today will be literally a joke in just 10 years. 
Read about storage technology coming up, read about 5G networks.
I still remember coding on blazing fast Pentium with 64Mb of ram rig with a massive 16GB hard drive.
Sure, not everything needs to be on chain, but there's just so many unknowns from an economic perspective when you then centralize transacting on chain because you're artificially constraining what can be done on it that only banks and fortune 500 companies will be the only ones to settle on chain, while you look around and there's 200 other currencies, and the top 5 after bitcoin today allowing everyone to transact virtually for free, with confirmation times in seconds, on chain, while also having more greedy upside for speculators.
As for full nodes, there's hardly any full nodes and there will be hardly any full nodes unless you change the economic incentives to run one. Other coins are doing brilliant things in this respect and they have way healthier node counts in comparison.
TL;DR; Hardware improves exponentially, there is competition ON-CHAIN that is faster and technically more capable already (privacy, fungibility), Bitcoin does not live in a bubble and the market is already moving away from it (look at Ethereum's price from March until today, vs Bitcoin's price on that same time period)

yes, finally this conversation made it to the top.
We'll need a 15GB block if we ever want bitcoin to become the financial network most investors out there think it is today, when in reality we can't do that many transactions and we have to do a lot off-chain to think of being competitive.
Meanwhile Alipay in China alone is processing up to 2.85 million transactions per minute, or 47500 transactions per second. At an average of 250 bytes per Bitcoin transaction, we'd need the blocksize to be 7125000000 bytes (7 Gigs) long to compete with Alipay alone, and then there's the rest of the world.
The internet itself is still not ready, hopefully 2 years from now Moore's law will help us take care of that in terms of bandwidth and CPU power. For now, a lot of projects we have in mind will simply have to wait as the network can't really compete.

"Just the tip"
@_date: 2015-03-02 12:03:39
what happens when the amount of money in the fund surpasses the amount of Bitcoin USD value held in it, say... simply because the managers can't buy Bitcoin fast enough.
since the fund is traded, the fund in theory should have a price of its own (based on the order book of the fund, how much are people willing to pay or sell Bitcoin for), to give it an example, let's say the fund has 100 million dollars worth of Bitcoin on some cold storage wallet, and they find 10 million customers that buy $10 worth of the fund each, the news spreads, and now a lot of other people want to buy the fund, the current owners hear about the bids on the fund doubling the price... in one way or another this fund should affect the price of bitcoin on other markets as people will want to arbitrage, the price of the fund can't always reflect the price of Bitcoin. This I think is a fundamental difference between buying bitcoin yourself and buying the fund. The fund is somewhat based on Bitcoin, but it can't be perfectly pegged, unless the price is not a function of the order book, and the price is simply some sort of index and somehow you limit the amount of bitcoin that can be purchased.

he means people don't understand about currency exchange rates, specially if they were born in the US and never travelled anywhere.
Bitcoin can be marketed better, I think for starters wallet software should by default show denominations in fiat, and make the BTC price something the curious user gets to know about.
That way, you just send dollars and receive dollars.
Every time I have to transact with real people, I always have to change in Mycelium the currency denomination to enter the dollar amount I want to send, with the current volatility it's impossible to know what a Bitcoin's worth is, bitcoin denominations are meaningless for day to day transactions, we put the value of things in our minds in fiat, that's what we're used to.
If we want people to use Bitcoin, we can't take them from A to Z in on step, Bitcoin needs to coexist, if necessary, as invisible as possible. People don't give a damn how things work, they just want things to work.

Playing devil's advocate, it's good that they try to do make you transact off chain.
Currently Bitcoin has a HUGE HUGE limitation of a 1MB blocksize (to avoid DDOS they say), with an average of 250 bytes per transactions that's only about 4,000 transaction in 10 minutes, or a ridiculous maximum of 400 transactions per minute... for a world wide financial network, when you have centralized solutions in china (Alipay) doing [2.85 million tx/min](

not sure how you will be able to take blocks if you don't have valid keys to sign the next block... you don't need the miners, all you need is more copies of the blockchain.
But if you think about it, if banks started transacting on a blockchain, only guys with shitload of resources would be able to keep up with so much transactional data, you'd go from 7tx/sec, to probably hundreds of thousands of transactions per seconds, only banks and well funded companies would be able to keep up with today's technology.

ether, dash, monero, ... credit cards and why not paypal.
It's only in this sub that people seem to suffer from a major reality distortion.
If stores can't survive because most people don't have the magic internet money this is going nowhere.
If you let people pay however they want, then sellers can play and give discount if you pay with X coin.
In the real world there's still lots of cash-only shops. You can't just replace a form of payment cold turkey.
From a seller that makes $15k monthly on FIAT selling glasses online:


and that's because of two simple reasons:
1. Not everybody has it, and they just don't effing want it. We sound like Jehova's witnesses guys.
2. Because of HODLRs greed.
it's a strategic weakness to base your product on a single experimental cryptocurrency when there's so much more out there.
I hope when they get a new round of funding, some of the people they hire dedicate themselves to making an abstract payment layer and then make it easy to integrate with all forms of payment available on the internet. This way the network itself would become a decentralized exchange.

the reason why people aren't running full nodes is because there's really nothing for most people in running them, that's the true. Eventually you get tired of wasting so much space without really any tangible gain. You try to vote into running a Bitcoin full node fork and you get DDOSed...
The lack of incentives for the every day person to run it is what threatens decentralization if that were the most important reason, we know that there's other interests at play here with keeping the block small. If people got money for processing transactions on their node, or performing some time of operation on it, say execute smart contracts or who knows, then that node count would inflate.
If maybe there were some kind of sharded node...
But you can't limit people's ability to transact and say that's the excuse. It's more worrying how mining is centralizing and how much power the miners have today, that most bitcoins are mined on chinese soul at the mercy of the communist party there.

You don't create inflation by spending money dude, inflation is created when more money is printed (or created with interest) and when the amount of wealth in the economy is less than what the notes represent, the consequence is therefore the dilution of value of all the currency that was printed, the currency becomes devaluated and then the result is that prices of things go up. If no new money enters the economy and the economy doesn't grow, it doesn't matter how much money is spent, the same amount of value exists in the system.
are you sure you know what inflation is chris? you keep contradicting yourself.

getting rid of the evidence. Lord knows all the levels of money laundering they have set up when it comes to selling the coins on that exchange. In a country in such dire situation it's pretty easy to find people that will launder your money.
When I have the time, I'll write about the ingenious schemes Venezuelans went through to cheat the currency exchange system, getting hundreds of thousands of dollars at the official (unreally subsidized) exchange rate (say 1 USD = 4 Bs) by paying hundreds of people to apply for the yearly USD allowance, then sending some of it via Paypal (Internet Allowance) and the rest by flying them to Miami to spend the money on stores that would be in the scheme along with cash advances. Then they'd sell the dollars at black market price making huge returns.
It's very easy to find people to launder money in Venezuela. Should be super easy to find young people to pay them to set up accounts on the exchange and give them a cut of what they sell.

Alipay, Alibaba's payment system, did 2.85 million transactions per minute on average during the Chinese "Single's Day" of shopping, which is like black friday and xmas combined in terms of transaction volume, but in one day.  
I truly wish Bitcoin will at some point be able to scale to this level, we'll need 15Gb blocks, or figure out alternatives if the internet and hashing power won't be able to catch up to the block size necessary to have it process incredible levels of transactions, and these may come from autonomous systems.
At this point Bitcoin will only scale so much as a decentralized payment system, the answer from core developers is relying on off-blockchain systems for larger numbers of transactions, which kind of defeats the purpose of Bitcoin.

for bandwidth- and computation-efficient anonymous communication. We have evaluated
Riffle in two different applications: file sharing and microblogging. Our evaluation shows
that Riffle can achieve a bandwidth of over 100KB/s per user in an anonymity set of 200

you also need to understand that there is A LOT of algorithmic trading on Bitcoin exchanges, which put the operators at a huge advantage over guys like you who are barely trying to understand what's happening.
they don't care about making huge profits, it's far less risky making smaller profits thousands of times a day, therefore yes, they'll compete on the smallest margins, they'll arbitrage from exchange to exchange.
making everyone agree to do what you say is impossible, everybody has different motives and circumstances, greed baby. Maybe you got in at $500, and at $550 you're looking already at an easy 10% profit (which is pretty awesome if you've been used at getting 7% returns in 12 months investing in more boring asset classes on the mainstream markets), when you know there's so much volatility you want to secure your earnings and sell, put that money in your pockets, and wait for the next movement, but then again, someone might have gotten in at the $220s and they're looking at doubling their money, why wait if you can make the money today, specially after we've seen crash after crash.
Some are more sophisticated and buy options and hedge against possible losses.
But it's good that you're asking, there's a lot to understand, and a lot has nothing to do with the news or with rational thinking. There's a lot of manipulation of the trends by the bigger players, who must be throttling the bitcoin supply from before the halving, and who are probably waiting a few months until all the smaller miners can't afford to operate at what now is twice the cost.
It's a lot of fun to watch this market.

To those who look at headlines and don't read the post.
The article DOES consider the black market exchange of 1 USD = Bs 1036 today.
As of this comment, the price on SurBitcoin is of Bs 557k, which translates into $536 USD, a 16% discount of the $672 on international markets.
There's several theories why the price drop.
Users reported they couldn't make withdrawals last friday, until tuesday, not sure if the situation continued, perhaps this caused a panic.
There's also a new scandal with government officials involved with Bitcoin, those people might be selling a large portion of what they have to wash their hands.
And there's also a severe food/health/social crisis in the country, some people might now be forced to liquidate in order to eat.

wait until the bills start to hit the smaller miners next month and the big miners who manipulate the supply on the exchanges keep it at the same rate so the price doesn't go up. Then my guess is that the big miners will short bitcoin, and sell a lot to drive the price down, then buy low and choke the supply to bring prices up, when new miners come in, repeat, and thus bring moar mining centralization to china.

yeah, but most people in surbitcoin are not the smartest traders, I spent 30mins explaining to a friend that instead of making a withdrawal of the bitcoins he sold last week at 670 in Bolivars, he should now be using canceling the withdrawal and using the opportunity to buy it all back thus having 20% more bitcoins than what he had last week. 
I literally had to explain like 5 times and guide him through the simple logic of buy low, sell high.
As the day goes by I'm sure the smart ones will figure out the opportunity, cancel their withdrawals, buy Bitcoin and move it to their wallets until everything goes back to normal.
Easy 20% risk free.

As of 12:59pm EST.
The price on SurBitcoin is of Bs 577000 per Bitcoin.
At a black market exchange rate of 1 USD = Bs 1036, this puts the price of Bitcoin on the exchange at $556.94 per Bitcoin.
Compared to the $672 weighted average price on international exchanges, this puts the Bitcoin in Venezuela, right now, at 17.1% discount. If you have a way to get Bolivares (selling USD over there through friends/family), this is a great opportunity to do some risk free arbitrage and get a 17% return on your money today, as getting the Bitcoin bought there into your wallet is frictionless. The hard part is converting the USD into Bs.
The reasons might be:
- Issues experienced by users doing withdrawals towards the end of last week and the weekend.
- Government officials involved in a [Bitcoin related scandal]( who might be trying to sell off.
- Venezuela is going through a major food shortage/medicine/social crisis, it's much harder to be a HODLR when you're in that situation.

They're just holding bitcoin until the moment there's 2 btc/btu tokens, they can control the supply of bitcoin at the moment, thus keeping the price high. When the time is right, they can dump btc for btu, while also making a ton of money on the alts they're going long for.

in practice it's the opposite. If people used it as a transactional system it'd collapse, it only supports 300k transactions a day at the most.
most usage of Bitcoin is happening indirectly in exchanges, and it will continue to be only that, a speculative asset, until it can scale. It owes all the public interest it's gotten only because of the investment community. As a currency it's still only good for a experimental scale and other altcoins will eat its lunch if we stick to the ridiculously small transactional capacity we have now.

@_date: 2017-06-08 15:48:07
you're thinking small.
Think that if LN is activated, then Bitcoin will be marketed to way more people, there would be a lot of competition in terms of LN hubs, and Blockstream most likely will sell their solution to the likes of Amazon, Google, Facebook, and Microsoft.
Imagine how many channels those 4 companies would open and close (think FB messenger, or Snapchat joining to let people send money over private snaps, people wanting to add/cash out balance to their LN-based wallets), perhaps you've never dealt with user scale anywhere near that magnitude, there simply won't be enough space for small blocks to open/close channels. Another nightmare scenario that comes to mind is that of a bitcoin price hike or crash and everybody at once trying to open/close channels.
In this massive network LN scenario, it'd be impossible for small hubs to compete, only well funded ones would be able to craft and pay for the transactions that open/close these channels.
Not sure if miners will want to stay around for this, or if this substitution to what Bitcoin was supposed to be will even work.
If only we'd focus on having no 3rd parties and strived for creative ways to scale in a purely decentralized matter.
There's a lot to worry about, and the price is looking nice to cash out before it pops, and that pop will only take a certain number of people to think of securing their earnings today, there will come a spilling point, and it will be uglier than ever.

Just have a way for people to buy the bitcoin in the area, and then they can use their phones to pay.

Massive usage leads to a lot more volume in exchanges to satisfy the many people and institutions wanting to go in and out of Bitcoin, this leads to a market that is harder to manipulate and you only have pice swings in the $0.00XY range, like all other currencies. With price stability people can now truly use Bitcoin wallets as saving accounts because it holds its value and it is also easier to accept and pay with given that it would be both stable and scalable.
Bitcoin being a stable unit of exchange makes it useful for both banking and electronic commerce, this is not a contradiction. But Bitcoin will never be this electronic cash many of us signed up for years ago, when you hear certain people saying it is ok to pay $20 in fees, they want to tuen Bitcoin into a SWIFT competitor, they will simply destroy it, it does not live in a void. Other currencies will pick up the demand for a stable and scalable electronic unit of exchange, this is so clear to me.

suppose LN happens, and then you successfully onboard 100 million users in one year, but we're still on small blocks, how many channels will be opened/closed daily? think of people wanting to add more funds to their LN channels, what will the cost per on-chain transaction be? which hub owners will be able to front that bill, what if you want to fund your LN wallet with $10, but the on-chain transaction fee is $100. I only see the big internet behemots and banks being able to run these nodes long term.

Maybe the Wall St/China vultures with a fund of $50 million or so in hand (petty cash for them) have started controlling the market price by buying everything and hoarding it, until it's good enough for them to sell it all off, or sell it little by little and squeeze every damn out of an army of trading noobs.

this is what we always wanted, this has been said a million times but some people don't want bitcoin to be electronic cash and are doing everything possible to turn it into a settlement network like SWIFT, which will be so expensive to use (in the named of decentralization because of small blocks...) that only banks and huge corporations will want to use bitcoin, supposedly, when you can't even send $5 from A to B, but they have this utopic dream that it'll be a settlement network.

i wonder if the utopic plan is to eventually make things free (in the case the world economy started moving to use BitCoin as a predominant currency), a coke would be worth a pico BTC, or less, wouldn't that almost be the same as free in the end as the value of the coin keps rising?
To understand, just imagine pouring the trillions of US dollars traded every day into a currency that only has about 20 million units in global circulation. At some point in time, being the holder of a single BTC will be the equivalent of owning 1/20,000,000 of the entire economy, with today's dollar, you hold nothing and you hold less and less as the Fed prints more money out of its arse every month.

Once all the coins are mined, what happens when a lot of people/institutions try to lend/borrow Bitcoin at a certain interest rate?
where will the extra money created out of interest come from if the supply of coins is finite?
I think it will be like Madmax to get bitcoin to pay for your debt, what happens to the BitCoin economy when so many people will have to default on their debts because they can't simply get the money? I'm having trouble conceiving this situation at a macroeconomic scale with a deflationary currency.

market fragmentation and lack of regulation leads to innefficiencies.
Just wait until Wall Street Quants pour their massive amounts of capitals and their trading algorithms on all the markets and maybe we'll see a balance as they compete for bitcoin.
In the meantime the few that might be there already might also be the cause for these defficiency (market makers), also this is good for you, open several accounts and start trading basically risk free. Beats working for anybody and you can do it from anywhere in the world, buy low, transfer the bitcoin, sell high, get money out, repeat ad naseum, make a killer.
@_date: 2013-05-31 02:54:37
then understand me, as more people come into the universe and they create more value (of all kinds, most importantly intellectual property can create huge amount of value to economies and it's certainly a renewable endless resource) the only way to reflect such growth in value is to devaluate at the same rate, otherwise there will not be enough coins.
so you say it can be divided (i hope it's been built to support a great decimal precision) for I see things like the price of a cup of coffee having prices that will have to be told in scientific notation BTC 1.22 * 10^-18
and those exponents will only go down further and further.
As this happens, this unstoppable deflation happens, it will be super hard to co-relate value to currency, we as humans won't be able to keep up, hopefully by then we'll live in a Star Trek like society where eventually currency loses all meaning and we do as we please, just live our lives because we'll have free energy and computers to do the hard work for us while we just learn and create (until computers get rid of us)

The way we see this development ocurring goes as follows:
1st Stage:
The Protocol allows the specification of a donation address by the content creator sharing via torrent.
At this stage, Bittorrent users can send donations in a pay-what-you-want fashion.
This would already be a huge incentive for many content creators to start sharing on the bittorrent network.
They'd get the donations minus bitcoin transfer fees, so they get like over 99% of the donations.
2nd Stage - Trackers receive a portion of the donations.
As we've discussed stage one, not opening the possibilities for trackers to receive donations would encourage tampering with the torrents by malicious torrent index sites and trackers looking to get a piece of the action.
3rd Stage - Payment only transfers
Transfers only start once a payment has been confirmed. For this stage it'd be very convenient if the bittorrent app has an implementation of a bitcoin wallet that will send the funds and confirm the payment has been received. Upon confirmation the client can begin the transfer, to avoid free riding, the trackers and the peers involved have to verify the transaction as well.
This phase has been very controversial, but I foresee more good than bad coming out of this, specially if we see the Bittorrent Protocol and Bitcoin protocol being integrated as a technological stack for companies to create content distribution platforms to which they have absolute control (rights to the content, subscriptors), they'd be able to use the bittorrent+bitcoin technology to create content distribution that could be monetized without the issues presented today by the centralized banking and currency exchange systems. To clarify, I'm talking about say a Netflix competitor, or Spotify competitor which would be able to charge anyone without a credit card for access to the system.
4th Stage - Preferencial Seeding, a new Bitcoin economy on top of Bittorrent
Perhaps this could be the third stage, and this one is very interesting to think and debate about.
You start a bittorrent transfer and you see an icon which tells you that this transfer supports a speedup if you're willing to pay a speed up fee, via Bitcoin.
As there could be competition for limited bandwidth, you could bid for bandwidth as you prepare your payment. Say you decide to pay the equivalent of USD $5 and you're the top bidder. The BTC is sent to the tracker which would act as escrow, and the tracker would let know the peers which have announced their bitcoin addresses that there's a bounty of $5/n peers, they'd start sending the pieces, and at the end of the transfer there would be a phase of checks and balances to know how the preferencial seeding ocurred so a fair distribution of the bounty occurs among those peers that sent file chunks. The tracker could also get a piece of the bounty for "transfer management fees"
This last stage would be the equivalent of introducing capitalism to a file sharing network that works pretty much like communism, perhaps this is philosophically in diametrical mindset to BitTorrent, but it's interest to imagine that more bandwith would be available on the network, as seeding content becomes the equivalent of mining bitcoin.
It's easy to foresee people seeding for months on end just to see the bitcoin balance on their FrostWire wallets go up, only to use it again later for faster downloads.
as for the micropayment channels, I need to read more on this myself, one of the authors of Bitcoinj said this:
"You need to check out micropayment channels ( You should also not use an address form (PLEASE) and instead let people specify an arbitrary script to send money to.

just bought my first coins there, but they won't come until next week. does it take so long everytime? or is it because it's the first transaction from my bank to coinbase?
@_date: 2013-11-18 19:43:37
it will take you some time to get that kind of money to an exchange with enough volume (MTGox, which has a problem when it comes to taking US Dollars back out, they're only letting out betweek $300k to $1MM a day only after the last crash, or so I heard, they're being rate limited by their bank)
However, if you manage to get the money there (will probably have to be done in chunks of $10k, gotta see what the limit is) it takes 7 days to do so, and a little bit of fighting with their support to acknoledge the transfer, it might be late for what you plan on doing, so probably your best bet right now is to try to buy using LocalBitcoin.com right here in the US, you won't be able to buy the $50k at once unless you're lucky enough to find a single guy selling so much of it, meaning it'll take you several transactions, but at least you'll be able to get in the game now.
You can also try coinbase, but you will be able to buy only 10 BTC on your first transaction, that's only going to be about $6k on today's price.
So there's really no easy way to buy that much unless you find sellers, this is still in its infancy, and you're not the only one with this problem.
Wish paypal would join the fun, it'd be awesomely convenient, but they seem to be either very against it, or maybe the government is breathing down their neck to not join the Bitcoin fun.
In china it's the opposite, perhaps you want to try a chinese market (where bitcoin is getting alot of positive press and media exposure, which is one of the factors driving the price up), in my case I just don't trust doing business over there, I feel like I might get ripped.
Good luck!

hell yes, as long as there's coins to be mined and as long as people are turning real life value into bitcoin the value of the bitcoin will only  rise (as it was designed to)
had you put your last salary into bitcoin last month you'd have doubled it.
you bet your ass it'll be worth $1,000 very soon, don't wait and buy some.
Keep in mind that more money (volume in USD) is traded on BitCoin every day than via Western Union already. The currency is very real, very convenient, people are using it to transfer very large sums of money without having banks ask any questions and for cents of comissions.
Any money you are not investing/using, you should be turning it into BitCoin (if you ask me)
And at this point in history it's only getting started, many people just talk about it, while enthusiasts are getting their feet wet, and others keep asking this question. Act fast.

Everytime I've tried to buy, they either want you to be an "accredited investor" and want to know how much money you make, or you have to sign up to weird unknown merchant services.
Also, is there a paypal equivalent for Bitcoin? (people to people merchant service)
A place that keeps your wallet(s) in the cloud and that you can make payments via email, without having to give away your bitcoin address?
If there isn't such a thing I'd love to get a team together and start building it.
The only way for Bitcoin to accelerate so that it's "Time to Buy" is if it's made VERY easy to get the coins and to trade them.

not if the ones that bought at 500 want to make a profit now at 600 thinking it won't go up, and the buyer side gets scared or put off by too high a price.
a crash is inminent in my book, the only question is, what will be the bottom.
greed an fear in all positions are setting themselves up.
greed: "it's going to keep going up, buy!", "can't wait for it to crash to buy super low, then sell high again"
fear: "i think it's too expensive now, I better sell before it crashes, people won't buy at these prices", "i better not get in now, it might crash after I buy"
It's so gonna crash in the following hours, unless there's a never ending supply of greedy fools.

"But it won't be a currency until volatility slows down."
If there's anyone that can do something about fixing volatility that's you David Marcus.
Volatility is a now a huge function of how Bitcoin is being traded.
It's very hard for most people to buy BitCoin, and the volatility most people talk about is created inside MtGox which has most of the trading volume.
That volume is considerably low because companies like yours won't allow people to buy/sell Bitcoin, if anybody could sell each other bitcoins with paypal, there would be a lot more liquiity and way more players to compete inside markets like MtGox.
As of now, those huge peaks and valleys exists due to inexperienced traders that can't or won't understand what a simple limit order is and who sell at market price or buy at market price when fear or greed comes to them.
More players will make the market more efficient and the price of bitcoin more stable. If anyone can help, it's paypal.

If China really wants to dominate the currency, we can expect nothing but a good outcome from the hearings.
The US cannot afford to lose ground and let China hold the power on what could be the world's most adopted cryptocurrency, just as a simple matter of principle, the world's economic super power cannot let China take the upper hand.
We can already see Mr. Bernanke giving Bitcoin a blessing on his letter, I say hold your coins, this shit is going to get a lot higher once the word a positive word is out and US investors are encouraged (indirectly) to adopt the currency.
