Walk away. Everything seems real unstable in the Crypto world ATM.

Im no expert if there is such a thing but I would just watch and wait a bit. Could be a day, week, month. Who knows in the Cryptoworld.

Do it and do it now.

I sent $10 in BTC to do a test and the fee was like $30.

At the end of the day this about making money not using Bitcoin. Lets all admit it.  Sell now and get your profits.
@_date: 2017-12-06 16:29:07
I agree with your statement but I think we are talking about Bitcoin atm.

I would have always said Hodl steady but theres a new swingin dick in town..BCH. Sell now. Get your profits. Maybe by back in later for the dip when we get there. Go now. Sell.

Right..either get in now of forget it. The ship is sailing.

I think I looked at those as well but couldnt get one till Sept. Needed something in July before the BTC split.

Got a Trezor hw wallet w BTC for abt $150 from their site. Cheapest one I could find pre Aug 1st split.

Didnt he say Coinbase can only do 15K?
@_date: 2017-08-23 04:04:58
Ive been going to this site for abt 16 years..and reading the admin/owners post for years...GLP gets huge traffic and UFOs are the least thing discussed here. If u want the latest news, goings on..chk in on GLP once in a while. 
So what would be the point of making up this story?
@_date: 2017-08-23 04:05:34
Was it a significant amount?
@_date: 2017-11-16 05:53:41
Its come and gone? Or is this the new Dip?
@_date: 2017-11-05 07:44:22
What a fuckhead.
@_date: 2017-11-23 04:26:11
Buy ASAP.
@_date: 2017-11-23 04:29:41
Buy it ASAP. 
@_date: 2017-07-28 05:30:57
I really appreciated this. 
@_date: 2017-07-12 02:39:47
A lot more xpensive there than buying through Trezor. Bought mine w Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-07-12 02:41:19
Just set up my Trezor today. Happy so far. Currently most reasonable HW wallet available.
