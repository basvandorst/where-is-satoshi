**OFFICIAL REPLY FROM BITDICE.ME CASINO.**
This topic related to [this](
First of all everything in this topic is a lie except that coins were blocked on BTC-E by our request and we appreciate their help on this case.
**OP is thief**. 
Account **goldcakes** has **no relation** to company BitDice Casino S.L.R. We do not know who it is and might be OP's alt.
Now, what has really happen was posted by **NLNico** on our official thread on [BCT](
We are preparing official reply which will be posted on reddit and BitcoinTalk soon.

**OFFICIAL REPLY FROM BITDICE CASINO**
As you aware, on March 24 BitDice lost ~145 BTC (more information can be found here:  We tracked down those coins. 85BTC were blocked on BTC-E by our request. We deeply appreciate their help and cooperation on this case. I kept silence about it while both parties conducted investigation. However, the thief went out public on reddit harassing reputation of BTC-E and impersonating BitDice developer. Here are the links:
I will try to say as much as I can without providing any private information about this case until further notice from our attorneys.
There were no dice playing by that user, he didn't win anything - he just stole the funds from the account. Legally it's called embezzlement and fraud. Coins were tracked down to the wallet that belongs to BTC-E. We got in touch with BTC-E and told them what has happened and they started their own investigation and delayed withdrawal of those coins.
I deeply apologize that it harmed reputation of BTC-E. They did what every legal business would have done in this case, that is attempting to seize the theft. And I really appreciate that bitcoin community can help each other in such cases.
At the moment case solved. **Coins have been returned to us**. On this I would again thank BTC-E for great help. 
BitDice Casino S.L.R.

That's really sad that's not provable fair casino is being placed on bitcoin.com domain. 
We at BitDice Casino believe that gambling should be changed with **real and bulletproof** provably fairness. Low house edge and good transparency (proof of solvency). And we already proved it by providing one of the most fair service. We also have one of the biggest payouts which is currently around 170BTC per bet, and only at BitDice players can win up to [550BTC](

You can't. Also there's no provably fairness.
@_date: 2016-05-11 16:15:24
Again AFAIK SoftSwiss has no provably fair. You can check it among hundreds of other white labels, like bitstarz and others. And Ver can't change games as it's White Label. I suppose SoftSwiss has received some certificate which proves they use some RNG algorithm and based on it they made a statement that they are PF.

Of course I use it to promote BitDice, it would be a lie to tell you I'm not. But there are different provably fairness. Casino can get a certificate and use it, but while user has no control from his part there's always a chance to alter result. AFAIK Softswiss doesn't have real provably fairness. And Ver's casino is a simply white label of softswiss.
Let me explain how real PF works: there are server seed  which is hidden, but casino shows a hash (sha512 or sha256) to user PRIOR bet, and there's client seed, which is being generated on the client or is set by the client. That client seed casino receives ONLY when bet is being made, then it applies server seed to client seed and by various algorithm generates outcome. Without knowledge of the client seed, casino can not make "loosing" outcome. And client having hash of the server seed can prove that casino didn't cheat and haven't altered server part.
If it's something different, there's always a chance to change results and you can not prove that you have been cheated.
