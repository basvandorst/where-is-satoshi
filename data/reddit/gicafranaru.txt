Bitfinex doesn't have to be bankrupt to halt withdrawals, it just has to be insolvent, and i don't think you understand what insolvency is. Once Bitfinex was aware of the hack, they knew they are insolvent. They could halt all withdrawals and wait for a court to confirm insolvency. Once that is confirmed, and it's a quick process, the company may refuse to accept your withdrawal because it doesn't help all the creditors.

if you look at the transaction history you can notice that the BTC isn't related to the recent hack

This is my guess too. They will probably force you to accept an agreement that you are ok with the haircut, if you want to withdraw your money or continue trading with them. I don't know how legal this would be, however a forced haircut on non-affected funds isn't either so it seems they are willing to take the risk.

I based in on my views of who will actually use it in the future and several papers i've read that analyze Bitcoin as a store of value and as a currency. 
The problem is a lot of the people invested in Bitcoin actually believe it will be used by the average person. But they fail to see that the average person barely makes it from pay check to paycheck, they don't need Bitcoin to store savings they don't have. And as a currency, it's not the cheapest virtual currency to use, and will probably never be. The average person doesn't care about network security, they will use whatever has the lowest fees. So my thoughts are that when you value Bitcoin you will need to think of it as a niche product, never try to value it based on usage by the total global population.

I strongly believe in bitcoin, however i never in a second thought that the current price is justified. When i first started with Bitcoin i bought it because i believed in the technology. Lately i only bought it for speculative purposes, knowing these prices won't last forever, and with the recent buys i never intended to hodl.

You are missing the point of their response. They state that cryptocurrencies are not a virtual currency (currency exchanges are not taxed) or financial instruments (which have special taxation law), which means any income you have from trading cryptocurrencies is taxed as "other income" or "income from foreign countries". You still have to pay your taxes, which is 10% of your profit.

Do you understand that your 5.981 sat/Byte transaction only got confirmed because your youngest son had to pay 250.63 sat/byte to send you the BTC back, when at that time the fee to get included in blocks was around 100 sat/byte? If your son wouldn't have paid that fee then, your transaction would still be in the mempool now. If you are really not trying to manipulate, please, please document yourself more. You are being brainwashed.

Lol, 260 satoshi/byte? You cheap bastard, you deserve it. I paid 480/bye (~20$ fee) a few hours ago and i am now afraid my transaction will be stuck in the mempool for days (at least).

Cash settled futures allow speculators with a lot of money to profit big time from price manipulation. Spot price can be influenced very easily if you have enough money:
1. Buy btc OTC (or even on exchanges to pump the price to an unstable value)
2. short futures (say 10x the ammount of btc you boufht)
3. dump the btc on exchanges in steps to lower the price
4. Profit.
And then there is that thing called arbitrage. If the spread grows, there will be market makers that will want to profit from the spread, and they will have to buy/sell the underlying asset to hedge the risk, so this will lower the spread.
So before calling everyone else stupid, do more investigation yourself.

Lol, when i wrote the first comment i didn't even look at the screenshot you posted. I looked now, and my assumption was correct: the recipient address was actually yours (3HCWY7dHqzXPXHdd5afu181Hk9d1vi8i1Q). In the background, the transaction at the top comes from 3HCWY7dHqzXPXHdd5afu181Hk9d1vi8i1Q. (tx id: 93d9f53f2f27b8f1f41f48a9877f97835cbbe7d7b77e7a2f9c6fab97f60cfe95). So why did you omit the part that you actually had to overpay 250.629 sat/B (and yes, you made a segwit transaction) to get the first transaction you sent to yourself confirmed? I just don't understand you people.... just admit when something is wrong.

For Binance it was easy since they have a USDT wallet software. Localbitcoins probably doesn't, and implementing one costs money (it doesn't just work simply as "Hey download this unknown software from here and use that"): at least 1 programmer to code it, then there is code review by someone else, then there needs to be approvals to have access to the private keys, and that involves other employees so all in all it will probably cost them more than 5000$ to return your money. If you try to sue them, they will probably list you a detailed cost of the entire operation and you will just abandon the cause.
@_date: 2017-12-21 13:50:48
Please stop manipulating. Your transaction was included in the blockchain only because the recipient (probably you) then paid a 250.63 sat/byte fee to spend the output, and at that time a 100 sat/byte was probably enough to confirm, so he overpaid to cover your transaction too. 
Do you realize that by spreading false information like this you get people to actually take your advice and have their transactions stuck in the mempool for weeks?

You can trade without any status. 
As for freelancers, the health contribution is capped to 2280 ron. For pension fund, the tax is 25%, however you are free to choose the tax base to any value greater tha minimum wage( if you chose thr minimum wage then it's 5700 ron). A freelancer is not an llc, so he does't pay dividents to himself, so no extra dividend tax is involved

You will have to pay health insurance, but that is limited to 10% of the minimum income in the country, no matter what you make. Since cryptocurrencies are not regulated, you won't be able to deduct any losses you have.  
@_date: 2018-05-13 19:40:40
There is no dividend tax. Just the 10% income tax and aprox 500 euros for health contribution. 
Since it's not regulated, they dont care about every transaction you do on exchanges, just the money that arrives in your bank account. The state sees it as regular income and by default will want to tax you on the entire sum arriving, so you would need a proof of the money sent to the exhange (if you bought the crypto directly from a person, for example, you will have a hard time to have only your profit taxed).

You only need to contribute for pension fund if you are employed or self employed (if you are self employed you will have the minimum wage as taxable base for health and pension funds). However since cryptocurrencies are not regulated, you don't have to be self employed. As i already said, you just declare the income as "other income" and you pay income tax+health contribution only. I talked to the tax authorities directly, and they said that "other income" is the best category where income from crypto would fit.

Microcontrollers can be flashed/have their flash memory read using programming interfaces, so the bootloader doesn't need to be loaded to update firmware. The microcontroller that Trezor uses has read/write protection for this, and i hope the team activated it, however this protection can be bypassed on some microcontrollers by playing with voltage and tricking the microcontroller. Since this is not a secure chip, most likely it doesn't have a voltage detection circuit to detect this. 
@_date: 2017-08-17 08:12:50
The problem is that because they don't use secure chips to store sensitive data, you can just read/update the entire contents of the chip's Flash memory. So that signature check is only good for firmware updates done through USB.
@_date: 2017-08-17 16:41:12

You are so wrong. Stocks are the safest investment with a decent return, if you are not in a rush to get your money out in the near future. History has proven it. There are indexes with more than 100 years of data to prove it. Bear markets can last a couple of years max. If you don't panic and are not in urgent need to get your money out, you won't loose anything. Bitcoin on the other hand has a very small history. The current price is based purely on speculation, not on real usage. It may go mainstream and be adopted as a day-to-day payment system or it may die. It's a very high risk investment for the long term. So if you did 10x or maybe 100x in Bitcoin already, it would be stupid not to diversify.
The market will turn bearish, but that may happen in 1 year, 2, maybe even more. The best way for an average long term invester without solid knowledge of the market is to enter now, not to wait for the perfect moment.

Sorry to break it to you, but the time the first margin trade was performed with Bitcoin, it was no longer a full reserve asset, since exchanges require from the trader only a fraction of the collateral to loan him Bitcoin (sure they have safeguards to prevent losses for them or their clients, however it's still fractional reserve). And once custody solutions get available for the masses,  fractional reserve will become very common in Bitcoin. You may not want to deposit your Bitcoin to a custodian, but others will for the interest they will offer. It's the same with fiat, the fact that you and only a small minority of the population keep cash instead of depositing it in a bank, doesn't prevent fractional reserve.
@_date: 2017-11-18 09:12:25
The fact that it's not a near term solution is the biggest problem. 
Another problem i see with channel factories is that if a party in the group spent all it's funds, it has no incentive to keep staying online, so he can just disappear, which forces the other parties he has channels opened with in that factory to broadcast the transactions where the lost party was involved, inducing huge losses for them if the on-chain fees are high. So to keep risks low factories should be limited to a small number. Trusting 20 strangers to be honest if they have nothing to loose is  naive. So that is why i consider the 20 party/100 channel example to be far stretched and actual scaling to be a lot smaller.
@_date: 2017-11-17 22:48:23
I also gave some examples why channels will not be open forever, as i said, please read the text.
@_date: 2017-11-18 00:02:09
Actually schnorr signatures should reduce transaction size by 25%, it is not a 25x scaling. The channel factories paper you quoted is in a pretty basic form, there is a a looong road from this to an actual implementation. It states a 50% decrease in on-chain usage in 3 channel parties (the number i used in my post). This is good, but i doubt it's enough, and it may take a long time until it gets implemented.
@_date: 2017-11-23 08:52:09
Please check your calendar date. Bitcoin is over 8100$, not 4500$, your $ calculations are completely off, and 1 input-2 output transaction is roughly 220 bytes, not 200, so correct  non-segwit transaction fee to confirm ASAP based on your data, would be 6.3$, close to 8.9$ average fee. A segwit transaction of same format would cost 3.3$.

Once you are are done smoking the hopium let's check some facts:
* WU fees are around 6%, not 10%. 
* There are cheaper alternatives to WU however people use them because they are at every corner for both sender and recipient. 
* The fees are high if you want money to be picked up immediately (yes the ~6% fee will get you the money in minutes). People pay for convenience. Now let's compare it to your solution: you pay 4% and get a voucher and send it to recipient. The recipient has to signup online, redeem voucher, and after he has to FIND a way to get cash out of his BTC. Easy way: a bitcoin ATM that adds an extra 10% fee to withdraw and probably an hour to wait for the ATM to approve your transaction. So total cost: ~14% fee. The hard way: use an online exchange, pay exchange fees, withdraw money to your bank, pay an extra 2-3% currency conversion fee and maybe wait a couple of days to get it. But if you still have to use a bank, there are way better alternatives out there.
So no sane person would use them for money transfers.

Put your numbers on paper. It will be easier for you to see that you as a bank will not have any extra money. In your example, the money that people owe you is the same as the money you owe to them (their deposits). If a bank doesn't charge any interest. When all people pay back their debpts, and the initial depositer gets his 100$ back. The bank will have 0$ left

Stop watching conspiracy videos. They don't create money out of the blue. They guy you quote is right, they just lend the money from the depositors. And they are allowed to lend up to 90% of the deposited money.  You can "print" money yourself exactly like a bank does. If a relative gives you 100$ for safe keeping, and you lend 90$ to someone else, then congratulations, you just created money. 
People that deposit money in banks are aware that their money will be lent to someone else, but for that service, they receive a small interest and guarantee of safe keeping. Money that is not used is wasted opportunity. Banks are intermediaries that help put unused money to use. The only problem with banks is when they get too greedy, and start to offer loans to individuals/entities that have a high risk of default. 
And another thing: Switzerland in no way made fractional banking illegal.
@_date: 2018-04-06 17:50:02
The money that is circulating in the sociaty are max 100$. The rest is just accounting numbers in the bank's books. There will never be 1000$ circulating in the society. What fractional reserve banking does is put unused money in the hands of people that have actual use for them. A healthy economy needs money to move hands.
@_date: 2018-04-07 06:18:08
If they all withdraw the money, the bank will just lend EXISTING money from another bank or the central bank, so the extra money that goes in circulation is not new money, it's all existing money. The only time money is created is if the central bank doesn't have reserves and is allowed to print money. So there is no danger if multiple clients want to withdraw at the same time as long as the bank is solvent. The only problem appears when the clients can't repay their loans back. 
But you still couldn't explain how the bank ends up with more money by this process. You can't explain it because the bank just doesn't make any other money other than the ones from the interest. It doesn't create money for itself.
@_date: 2018-04-06 16:11:16

I was trying to explain to you that fractional reserve is not some mambo jumbo that only banks can do. You can do it yourself too as an individual, and the additional money that you create is just some notes that you keep, but in circulation you won't have any new money. 
Please answer me one question. If you think fractional reserve is evil i assume you are agains loans of any kind right? You think any lending should be banned?
@_date: 2018-04-06 15:53:22
The money of the depositors are out of circulation. They agreed, when they deposited, that the bank can do whatever it wants with it but promises to return them to the depositer when he asks. It's an agreement between them from which both parties win something. You as an individual can do exactly the same thing just like a bank. The money you will be creating is just virtual, and temporary. In circulation you would still only have the initial 100$.
@_date: 2018-04-06 20:12:31
Money lent for consumption do increase productivity. If a client lends money to buy a tv, a phone or a car, he actually stimulates production of goods, therefore stimulating the economy. The only problem with fractional reserve is when a client is allowed to lend more than he can pay back. And this is done by greed for profits by bank employees, this is not a funndamental flaw in fractional reserve system itself. Yes, the implementation has flaws because it's implemented by humans which don't always make the correct decisions, and in the case of banks, all of us have to pay for their errors, however, fractional reserve gave access to money that were otherwise not used, for both producers and consumers and lead to the technological advances we have today.
