What is the value of the bitcoins on that wallet? You'd have to weigh the cost of trying to brute force passwords for the rest of your life vs. just writing it all off.
One thing that you didn't account for is that the password length will remain the same, but computing power will get better and better for the rest of your life. So this problem may not be as lengthy, 10 years from now.

What if we had access to quantum computers or botnets or Watson or some other AI? Really depends on how much hardware we have at our disposal. I get that a trillion years seems daunting, but the problem may be entirely different in the future.

This sounds interesting. What's your setup look like?

Might be a more effective use of your electricity to just set up and mine a new bitcoin.  lol

Down for me.

No, no way. Your math is wildly optimistic.
@_date: 2017-12-12 05:27:26
Huh. Okay, I believe you. I am just parroting what someone else told me yesterday. He was an accountant or tax guy or something.
@_date: 2017-12-12 02:40:10
Interesting. That is a direct contradiction from some accountant guy that posted yesterday.

I thought that you weren't taxed until you realize those gains.
Buy one bitcoin at $1000.
Bitcoin doubles in value to $2000.
Sell 1/2 bitcoin and get your initial investment of $1000 back.
You still have 1/2 bitcoin and $1000. You didn't realize any gains until you sell the second 1/2 bitcoin.  If you hang onto it for 10 years, you don't pay taxes until then.
Am I misunderstanding this?

Coinbase down for anyone else? It is not accepting 2FA code.

Tell him to Dollar Cost Average. Instead of putting $1000 a year in, buy $20 a week.

Does this include fees?

Why does reddit even HAVE a chat function? Literally the only time I've ever gotten messages were from bitcoin bots. And you can't disable it.

Is there a newbie basic guide for moving bitcoin off of coinbase directly onto a Ledger? I understand that you are supposed to use Electrum(?) to avoid software issues but I have no idea how any of it works.  Just want to have a hardware wallet and a sheet of metal with 24 words stamped on it. Need a step by step non-technical guide to get me there. This bitcoin will never be sold in my lifetime. I'm a hodler. Need to have a simple instruction sheet for the person who inherits it to be able to get it off the hardware wallet and sell it.
@_date: 2019-06-28 23:47:54
Stamp the letters into a sheet of titanium. It would survive even the hottest house fire. Can't corrode. Can't rust.

Disregarding the up-front cost of equipment, what do you spend on electricity and what do you get back out of it in bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-04-04 00:25:28
Yeah, it's almost back up to half of what I paid for it.
@_date: 2018-02-06 19:01:22
You don't have to think about paying taxes until the day you sell.

I rent my wife out instead of selling her. More long term profit that way.
