Our sincerest apologies to all customers for this inconvenience. We are working to find an alternative as fast as we can.

Funds are not frozen.  It was a business decision on their part to not work with Bitcoin.

I must say this link seems severely biased.  We have 60,000+ customers who use CampBX regularly, and we are the oldest Bitcoin company in USA.

Hi YAT, we use a fully automated system to print and mail out all withdrawals via USPS certified mail.  If USPS cannot find the exact address you provided, the mail gets returned to our office.
This is what seems to have happened in your case.  Helpdesk should reach out to you shortly for address verification, and mail out a replacement check.

Chariman, not trying to shill but wanted to point out that CampBX is PCI, CISP, and SDP certified, and fully audited by multiple independent security auditors.

Sorry to hear that a lot of people's bitcoin deposits were lost in the BitFloor hack.
CampBX has been in operation for over a year, is based in Atlanta, and has successfully cleared multiple independent Pen-tests and security audits.
Give us a try!

Hi Scrubadub, you are correct: McAfee is one facet of a comprehensive security audit at CampBX.  We are PCI, CISP, and SDP certified, and audited by multiple independent security auditors on regular basis.  We have shared security audit reports with trusted members of Bitcoin Talk community for peer-review. 
You can read more about our security credentials on our FAQ page.

Hyh123, we always ensured quick trade execution (&lt;3 seconds) since our launch and we are acutely aware of recent slowdown.
CampBX gained 7,000+ users in one month due to increased in interest in Bitcoin, way more than our capacity plan estimates.
We are actively working to resolve this: there are major database upgrades going in production in first week of May, and four new enterprise servers going in data center in last week of May.  
We have our challenges, but we are committed to fixing them.

This is grossly inaccurate post on all three counts, 1930197.
We have locked accounts only for valid reasons like hacking or fraud attempts, or requests by Dwolla team.  
We do not provide support over phone as it is really difficult to track communication made over phone calls.  Helpdesk ticket system is the best way of resolving customer issues.
And we do not use PO BOX - lots of customers stop by our Alpharetta office every week.

Hi Everyone, 
Dwolla used to hold your funds for 31 days before you can deposit it in CampBX.  They now have removed this requirement, so CampBX has implemented the exact same requirement on our side of the fence.  
We will provide a full explanation on Dwolla policy change tomorrow morning but couple of quick notes:
1) This change is not retroactive.  It applies only to NEW Dwolla deposits May 1 onwards (as announced on CampBX news feed on April 30 morning).  Wish we could have given a longer notice, but Bitcoin as an industry is evolving rapidly and this is one such example where we had to react fast.
2) All other forms of deposits including USPS money order deposits and personal check deposits are not affected by this change.  You can buy and transfer Bitcoins out without any issues.
3) Dwolla withdrawals are not affected.  You can sell Bitcoins and freely withdraw money through Dwolla.
4) If you are uncomfortable with the hold on Bitcoins, you can always withdraw your money back to Dwolla.  We only hold the Bitcoins, not USD.
Thank you,
     Keyur

Keyur from CampBX here - happy to answer your questions in AMA.  What time did you have in mind?  Later in the week is better because we are working on pushing our some code changes.

Expiring Bitcoin addresses is a performance requirement.  Tracking millions of BTC addresses simultaneously takes a huge toll on trade engine responsiveness.

Place, we have completed migration to the new servers this morning. Please try out CampBX today and let us know what you think of the speed.

Italeffect, we migrated TestNet as a trial run to work out the kinks in livenet migration. 
As of this morning everything is running on new data center in Atlanta. Try us out and let us know what you think of the speed.

Dear Throwaway, we are not refusing to change the money order, however we need a scanned image of MO to address any deposit issue as standard procedure.  Once we confirm scanned images with bank records, any shortfall would be resolved immediately.

Hi VienneseCPA, give CampBX a try - our Bitcoin broadcasts are near real-time.

Please let me know if you have any questions and we will make sure we answer them. 
Thank you!

This seems to be a broad phishing attempt, where users who don't use CampBX have received similar mails. We have multiple test accounts on CampBX with multiple domain names, and have not seen any such mails in spam or inbox.

Hi SBL, thank you for your kind words!  Our goal is to keep trade execution times under 3 seconds. After this morning's migration to new data center in Atlanta we are around 1-2 seconds trade execution. Give it a try!
Now that migration is over, developers will resume implementing more features starting August. You will see couple of changes to make live trading more accessible for day traders.
