At beginning, Internet wasn't easy to use. I remember me using a very slow modem, many softs without gui, and so on. Internet went mainstream.
Let the BTC biotop grow. Those not interested in financial freedom or technic skills will use BTC through third parties like financial companies (see for example [coinbase.com]( or [metaco.com]( 
@_date: 2018-09-30 09:15:47
Look at metaco.com... 
@_date: 2018-09-17 19:40:08
The same goes for financial freedom as for other freedoms: many do not use it but are satisfied that they can use it at any time. As long as you can withdraw your BTC, you'll find back the financial freedom.
BTC offers other advantages than avoiding third parties, you know it for sure.
With internet you can loose much: your secrets, your reputation, your fiat (through malwares and scams) and so on.

Thank you. I don't understand :
- After sweeping, does the paper wallet exists anymore ? May I use it ?
- Why Sweep instead of Import ? What the advantage of importing ? Why Import is less secure ? 
    Import: Less secure, but requires no fee. The paper wallet continues to hold funds after import.
    Sweep: More secure, but requires a 0.0001 bitcoin fee. After sweeping, the paper wallet is empty.

As I understand being no technologist : like a cold storage connected to a soft (try their 'tutorial', it's like you had it on your mobile). Your private key goes online only encrypted. You have to input a password to pay. The password cannot be sniffed by keylogger (there is no keyboard on the mobile).  Plus : the gold one will have copies in swiss banks to your disposal. Look their site +  + their friendly support. 
I have a silver for my current expenses and a silver one for my savings. I'm waiting the gold one.

Sorry, I've nothing to do with bitcoin-central, though I've open an account there. It seems interesting to show a market which adopted local laws constraints and found a good way to protect the client with a bank.

You are right but two of them seem to be in touch with ETHZ in Zürich.

Mixing money just to protect privacy (without illegal thought) in little transactions cannot be illegal. Is it illegal to cash some money from your bank account to buy something ? Is it illegal to send money to Bob to let him buy something for you ?

Bitstamp obeys anti-money laundering rules. Banks or other financial institutions are obliged to take an interest in the economic background of transactions. Bitstamp has decisively decided to scrupulously respect the laws applied in Europe. 
Whether it is good or not, we must admit that there is no survival possible in Europe for a financial institution that does not apply these rules, especially in the case of cryptocurrencies.
@_date: 2017-03-11 18:36:35
I completely agree. But to be realistic I am not convinced that the majority of the public does not prefer to pay sneaky fees in place of self managing security procedures. Pessimistic point of vue, I agree.

Sorry to be soon downgraded for writing this, but I have to notice that actually Bitcoin is not so easy to use with security in mind. No problem for little amount but with big amounts... 
@_date: 2017-03-11 17:42:56
Litte amount: install the wallet, put it the equivalent of 20$ and forget security coz you may loose some bucks. Large amount: cold storage or trezor or ledger, write the 12 or 24 words in such a way they cannot be stollen but can be retrieved by your family in case of death, avoid malware with keylogger, and so on. Many are not interested in learning security procedures. Call it laziness, I call it human weakness.

Dangerous to copy the seed on your computer. Zeroknowledge ok, but uncrypted on/from your computer. Don't do this.

Interesting, thanx.
@_date: 2018-06-02 16:46:03
You need to use cryptosteel.com or blockplate.com to backup your seed. Blockplate is cheaper. I think blockplate is better because you use two plates you can split. There is a way to buy blockplate's alternative in Europe.

I like very much Andreas, a good and charismatic guy who does much in favor of Bitcoin. But I cannot agree with him about the fact that Satoshi had no power on Bitcoin. The ability to flood the market with &gt;1M btc is a power.

For the pwd manager you have to buy a new Trezor, I think so. Though the bitcoin wallet let you use an app on the smartphone in place of the Trezor. 
@_date: 2016-09-21 17:01:10
Actually, many people will never buy a Trezor and learn to use it. They will prefer to let their banks do the job... or never use bitcoins.

There is also a lot of laziness. Admission of the concept gives more work to understand and explain it.

"[...] article published by the NYT [...] argues that Bitcoin’s immutability is a weakness and that a blockchain should allow its history to be rewritten to fix accounting errors."
In my country you may not delete and rewrite an accounting error. You fix the error through a new input.
