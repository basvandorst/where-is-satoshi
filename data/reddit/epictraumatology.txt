Cool, sign this exact message with your private key holding a whale's worth of Bitcoin.

When more people use Bitcoin Cash than Bitcoin Core, and the fees are still $0.01, will you eat your hat?
@_date: 2017-12-17 18:40:56
Read the Bitcoin whitepaper. It explains how the electronic cash ledger is arrived at by consensus.
@_date: 2017-12-17 18:39:33
Hashpower. It can't be faked. Unlike Redditers, Twitters, Transactions, etc.

Check out Litecoin's distribution versus Bitcoin Cash:
50% of Litecoin is in 70 addresses:
 
@_date: 2017-12-16 05:47:01
I'll bet it was a 0.08 BTC fee.

Knowledge is scary.
@_date: 2017-12-18 03:02:36
Prove it with a transaction hash.
@_date: 2017-12-16 05:21:02
Absolutely support this!!!

Every transaction for the last two weeks has been suckers and newbies?

I can't expose my true identity as a Bitcoiner from 2012; too dangerous. You all should know what the Real Bitcoin is. What has utility.

How's that store of value now?

-15% for a moment
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:51:51
What do you do once you have it? Too expensive to transfer off the exchange. Do they give you an IOU?

The title of the paper is Bitcoin: Use visa then

Ditch BTC, if you even can. The blockchain is frozen. The revolution will not be centralized.
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:01:20
I've waited two weeks to clear my transaction. I'm never using BTC again. Bitcoin Cash fixes everything.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:58:24
Store of value
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:57:08
Higher capacity, huge market share, and same legacy of mining as BTC.
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:16:33
I am a whale from 2012, and hide my identity. I know what the real Bitcoin is. It's peer to peer electronic cash, like the whitepaper says.
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:56:27
SegWit removes signature data from the blockchain; preventing us from verifying all transactions. It uses an opcode that means "Anyone can Spend". It's complex to add to exchanges and wallets. It's an unneeded and risky "feature".
Bitcoin Cash scales as intended, to keep fees low. It most closely matches the Bitcoin whitepaper: peer to peer electronic cash.
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:10:30
Bitcoin Cash is more decentralized:
50% of Litecoin is in 70 addresses:
 
@_date: 2017-12-16 05:48:18
Stay the course.
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:51:56
20% due to increased hashpower, lost due to difficulty adjustment.
@_date: 2017-12-18 03:04:21
By destroying bitcoin they're rewarded with bitcoin. Makes sense to me.
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:51:35
No. BCH has the same mining legacy as BTC.
Litecoin can't compare - it's mostly been mined and held at extremely low prices. Look at the currency distribution of BCH versus LTC.
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:23:57
Your proof would be as easy as copying and pasting text. You liar!
@_date: 2017-12-16 17:24:18
$100 if you prove it with a transaction in the past week that paid less than $2.75, your average.

Which Bitcoin fork is closest to the whitepaper? I'll call that one Bitcoin.

2009-present of fair mining issuance.

Average fee is distorted by intentional misuse. Use the minimum fee / byte to get into the next block: 
1 satoshi / Byte
BCH @ $20,000 and 226 byte transaction == $0.045 fee
I appreciate that you tried. Did I make any mistakes here?
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:05:03
Lost 15% today
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:26:59
Yeah, 4x cheaper "weight" fee per byte, an unfair discount. Should be 1.7x cheaper per byte, to match actual costs.
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:53:10
It'll be so healthy as it falls below BCHUSD.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:55:00
It's lost 20% of its value in recent moments.
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:50:03
Bitcoin Core was the fork from the whitepaper. It shouldn't be called Bitcoin: A Peer to Peer Electronic Cash. It's more like StuckGoldCore.
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:00:27
Wrong idea. The advantage is the fair and earned issuance of currency. I don't want one single holder to dictate the supply of the currency. 
Bitcoin has been hard-fought since 2009. Bitcoin Cash continues that, and alt-coins can't compare.
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:59:35
Ah, Ledger allows custom fees, but only down to 2 satoshi / byte. I think their API's spam limit is 1 sat / byte.
@_date: 2017-12-16 17:06:56
How many are above the median fee?
@_date: 2017-12-16 05:39:20
Captain, there's been icebergs reported along our route.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:55:21
You're getting red-pilled on what Bitcoin really is. Electronic cash.
@_date: 2017-12-16 05:16:23
Bitcoin has hard forked before. Bitcoin is the project that best matches the whitepaper:

You should respond to the content, if it offends.
BTCUSD -20%
BCHUSD +200%

2X was a blocksize increase: same transactions, just more of them.
SegWit is voluntary, and quite complex to incorporate into a wallet. New address format, new transaction format, new data structures.
@_date: 2017-12-16 05:37:59
You get 1000 posts a day from dissatisfied customers?
@_date: 2017-12-16 05:43:46
Reach consensus on a block height or time, replace a 1 with a 2.
Hard forking is easy, Bitcoin's done it before.
@_date: 2017-12-15 17:25:35
Bitcoin.com said they would do this if SegWit2x wasn't adopted. Old news.
@_date: 2017-12-16 05:40:24
YOU HODL while I cash out.
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:54:40
Oh yeah this is a real post
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:48:31
No, take the average of these fees: [1000, 0.01, 0.01, 0.01].
Average is 250. Median is 0.01. I'd be happy to repeat the argument using the median; although the correct price is the minimum needed to get into the next block. (For BTC, last block minimum fee was 575 sat / Byte)
Can you link me to the transaction ID? Rarely, blocks come infrequently by chance. If it made it into the next block, that's as fast as transactions can happen.
Plus, Bitcoin Cash removed replace-by-fee, so you can trust 0-confirmation transactions with tolerable risk. No need to wait 3 confirmations.
@_date: 2017-12-16 17:12:31
A week straight of $10+ fees.
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:40:58
Yeah, it's my favorite block explorer.
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:54:16
Bcore is set up for a king is naked moment, realizing that once the blockchain seizes, the miners will simply pack up and leave for profits off the real Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:07:07
25k, about 0.1%. I won, because you didn't counter my argument. Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin! 
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:59:22
Bitcoin? That shit is frozen unusable.
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:17:15
It I was incorrect, it'd be easy to refute.
@_date: 2017-12-16 07:02:55
Is it many? Or not enough?
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:52:34
Money you can't move is the best money!
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:59:00
I'm a 2012 whale. Bitcoin should be about the content of the message, not the messenger.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:57:55
Crazy, people should read the white paper. Bitcoin Core is totally Peer to Peer Electronic Cash; with lightning hubs and IOUs!
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:24:56
The current wave will blow over as BTC falls down the market cap list.
@_date: 2017-12-16 05:45:08
That was back when it was a peer to peer currency; it's different now.
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:41:01
"operated at this capacity"
uh, it's been stuck at this capacity since the beginning of the year.
