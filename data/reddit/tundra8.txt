Does it apply to transfers? Buy Bitcoin and trade it in for Litcoin for example, has a taxable event occurred?

That kind of welcoming, helpful atmosphere will surely help future adopters.

In stocks, loans, gambling, and any financial transaction someone might lose. It's not a new thing, you don't oppose something because someone, somewhere might get hurt. As with all financial decisions people care about themselves. You can hate it, but truth is plenty are making easy money. 
That hypothetical college kid could have already made thousands if he had bought in when this was posted and gotten out clean. Does he decided to stay and lose it all in 20 years? Well he made a choice.

No you're right. People are excited and overly hopeful leading others to false expectations when there is little context.  
It was pitched to me as gambling; whether or not it is is irrelevant because if people know the risks then they can be more intelligent about it. But if you go in expecting danger it's easier to stomach. You're a wise fellow and I wish you the best!

I mean, if you had bought a single bitcoin when this was posted, and sold it now then you'd have made $800 that easy. 
A lot of idiots sure, but man easy money is easy.

In this thread: 
-People who own Bitcoin and are elated. 
-People who have no idea what is going on and are curious
-People who are super salty they passed on buying

When did I ever say anything about the system, banks or corporations? Your projecting your disgust with a subreddit onto a random dude who owns Bitcoin. 
I don't care about banks or some grandiose ideal and honestly most owners probably don't. I care that I've made money and have great future potential to make more. 
This post was on r/all remember? If you hate me for making money well then sorry dude.

With what I have already sold, I have doubled my investment back into my own pocket. If it all just disappeared to zero tonight, I'd still have twice my money. If it doesn't, I have even more. You don't have to just stand there with the bag in hand, ya know?

The entire stock system we have is set up that way. If you oppose the financial system on moral grounds then absolutely Bitcoin isn't for you.

So bitcoin newbie here, why dump exchanges? I use coinbase. That bad?
@_date: 2015-11-04 03:12:13
So...I have no idea how to do that...

Thank you kind sir.
