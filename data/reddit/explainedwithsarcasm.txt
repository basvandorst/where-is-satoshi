Me too. I bought and sold on Coinbase without any problems. That's two of us, what are the chances?

Looks like you got really crappy support from Coinbase. But you nailed it: bitcoin adoption is doomed as a direct result of poor customer service from Coinbase.

A wallet is software (computer or app on phone) that controls the public and private keys, thus allowing you to send/receive bitcoin.

I'm not clear on the true implicating of a hard fork. If Bitcoin Unlimited is successful at becoming the default node, would a hard fork have the same result as what happened with ETC and ETH (two separate currencies). 
Other than increased block size, I would think that this would be a disaster. What am I missing?

Less!!! If I was you, I would hang on to alt coins until the BTC price crashes to $100. In the short term, alt coins are definitely the way to go! /s

I'm a bit of a Linux noob, but was able to install 14.0 on my RasPi3 using [this tutorial]( What steps in that tutorial do I follow to update to 14.1?

Sweet, thanks. I'll give it a shot!
