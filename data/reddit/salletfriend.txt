If store is "Have there for any time" you are correct.
I think most people here read "Store" as "When you aren't in front of the keyboard" which is valid.

If packets aren't being sent over your network, you don't blame yourself for not paying your own network more money, you start troubleshooting the protocols being run on your network. You don't pay a network cable to have your packets transmitted first, you buy a better cable.

I think it is quite clear in 1984 that the proles are controlled through the means that Huxley talks about. Mostly that they just need to be kept well fed and distracted.

I love that comic, but to me I think we are doing both in small steps. For every draconian law there's a new reality TV series. Books are banned AND nobody reads the ones that aren't.

So hypothetically if you and your brother from another mother had to get a significant portion of funds to the Cook County Assessors Office you could simply transfer bitcoin to the corresponding public record and save the orphanage without a hilarious car chase through Chicago.

That's actually a very reasonable position.

ABC (Aussie) had a security/crypto guy come on (seemed like short notice) and just confirm everything the BBC article said almost word for word. I imagine the story tomorrow morning will be different. But it is being repeated without any journalists attempting to test the claim.

Cointree is pretty good. Accepts in person bank deposit and after your first deposit, BPAY.

If someone tries to sell you something with the justification that it will make you money, the profit is always in selling the thing, not running it.
