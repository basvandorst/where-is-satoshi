All of those uses can be applied to bitcoin. Just simpler. Bitcoins use &gt; golds use.
Storing money in bitcoin is good for the educated user as it provides quicker ROI than a standard savings account ect. (The main thing is you have to be educated in it)
I know 20 people invested in bitcoin. All 20 are educated in the stock market and actively invest.

Does gold or silver have uses as payment?
I can use bitcoin on a number on online services.
People will keep investing to use as a stock i think.

Hey! 
So im new and i have a question.
I wanna buy one of these but i just realized something when watching a setup video.
It showed that you have to chose if you want segwit or legacy for your wallet.
Im currently using coinbase so i dont know which it is using or the detrements of picking the wrong one. Can anyone shed light on this.
@_date: 2017-11-27 12:45:25
I think its an s-curve. There will be dips coming up soon ish but i think its gonna keep going.
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:35:13
BCH isnt too great either.
@_date: 2017-11-23 20:19:19
Why will there be a dip?
@_date: 2017-11-27 03:41:28

@_date: 2017-11-27 03:28:13

@_date: 2017-11-24 23:04:21

@_date: 2017-11-23 20:26:55

@_date: 2017-11-27 03:35:48
Thats what i do. Buy. Put profit into wallet. Wait till that profit amount comes back. Move to wallet. Repeat.
@_date: 2017-11-24 22:56:17
Commenting for later to look up those videos.
@_date: 2017-11-17 16:38:15
You were rather condecending in your delivery :/
But to get started. Heres an upvote.
@_date: 2017-11-23 20:34:20
Ill treat it as a sale like everything else :)
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:34:07
What miner should i use on nvidia gtx 970
@_date: 2017-11-21 21:58:48
You seem rather informed. Which exchange do you recommend?
@_date: 2017-11-13 00:44:02
Only option :/
@_date: 2017-11-21 21:18:42
Just buy it.
Also provide him with the places to research it but make it his responsibility to be in control of HIS investment.
@_date: 2017-11-27 03:38:12
While on the topic i saw in a setup vid you have to pick segwit or legacy. If i wanna move from coinbase to wallet which do i pick.
Sorry im new :)
@_date: 2017-11-21 21:24:41
One thing i always make sure to say when getting people into investments is to stress that it thier decision how they handle thier money.
@_date: 2017-11-12 20:06:56
Im new to investing. 
Is it really a good time to buy?
@_date: 2017-11-11 22:32:07
Ah. I must be misinformed
@_date: 2017-11-24 22:57:37
Good luck! And welcome.
@_date: 2017-11-11 22:19:22
Hey! Im new and have a couple questions.
Where should i keep them otherwise?
When coinbase switches to bitcoin cash where should i trade.
@_date: 2017-11-25 15:11:02
I use coinbase. Very easy for me to buy my bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 01:56:42
For sure! I'm hyped. I think it will recover eventually once major news sources stop shitting on it. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 00:34:54
As much as I want to believe in this I always feel it's important to remind people that while it's always easy to read Reddit and hodl or jump on the bandwagon it is always better to do your own research and make your own independent financial decisions.
