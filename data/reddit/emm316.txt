That would technically be like a pump &amp; dump if you coordinated with everyone to do it all at once and that would be illegal.

I used the same e-mail address to file two claims with Kraken.  It was fine at the time because the logins maintained the original Mt Gox login names...
Now that they are changing all the usernames over to the registered e-mails with this 2FA thing, I am really worried that when I file the second claim, they will conflict and I will only be able to access one out of the two claims... 
Has anyone filed two claims with the same e-mail?  
Namjies, I've been reading all your replies and your knowledge so far has been 100% on point, please help!
P.S. I read the entire thread to make sure I am not asking something that has already been covered.

Thanks!  I agree with that assessment, I will head in and submit the second claim.  Cheers.

It did not work, the error it gives is:  "An error occurred in the registration, please try again. "
It is obviously too late for me to do the offline claim &amp; even if there was time, it's no good because we dont live at that address anymore...
This is devastating.  Any ideas?

Yeah, I understand all that, but the problem for me is that I used the same e-mail for TWO claims and now the new system from the trustee uses that e-mail as the login, so how will I maintain access to BOTH claims once I transfer over to the new system?? or will it let me set a new e-mail as the username???  I need to know before I start the second claim so I don't loose access to the first one.
