yes, but the fees, bro.

If it doesn't get mined it will eventually(EVENTUALLY) revert back. It's a small gamble of getting your money tied up, but worth it to save money if you won't need it anytime soon.
@_date: 2018-01-06 07:36:00
honestly at this point you know more than me. I'm still new at this, just picking up information. the speeds and blocks mean nothing to me just yet haha.
@_date: 2018-01-19 03:28:59
when you compare the explosion we had, it's not really that bad. Market's correct, that's what they do, we had a correction right on top of a yearly low time.
@_date: 2018-01-13 05:33:55
your "better" question just completely negated my question... so your definition of better is a bit off...

This week is notorious for the yearly low. stop watching it, check back in a week or 2.
@_date: 2018-01-18 11:19:32
are you in the US?
(edit: If you are in the US the new 1031 tax law restricts crypto from "like-kind changes". meaning everytime  you trade a coin, it's taxable.)
@_date: 2018-01-04 07:41:09
So say coinA is 12 buy, 10 sell. I buy coinA at 12, then trade for coinB. Since this is usually the case, aren't most exchanges a loss and not recognize? Is it essentially just watching for short term gains. For instance the price increases between the time you buy coinA and the time you trade it for coinB?
@_date: 2018-01-19 03:52:45
Wheeeeeeel offfffff FORTUNNNNEEEEE!
@_date: 2018-01-19 09:52:12
umm, where you been the last week? price has dropped 5k+. I mean sure it's possible, but i don't think they have a reason to, their is so much volume they make their money easy.
@_date: 2018-01-11 02:43:58
that's 3.4k.... I don't see bitcoin dropping 10k that quickly, but who knows.
@_date: 2018-01-12 02:36:55
nah, it's just setting a price to buy/sell at, watch the order book you can see whats selling, what's buying and get your lowest price without any flippin fees besides the tx one.
@_date: 2018-01-13 04:10:33
DFS Coin, check it out.
@_date: 2018-01-05 03:48:10
coinbase is weekly limit, but once you cash out to their USD wallet your limit is 10,000 from the USD wallet. Just means you have to wait like 12 weeks to get full use of it.
@_date: 2018-01-13 03:50:50
geez 2? i dunno if i can handle it... i guess i'll try!
@_date: 2018-01-13 04:51:35
For someone who's new, what does this potentially mean for the price of BTC?
@_date: 2018-01-12 02:05:04
better off transferring it to gdax for free, and using limit buys to avoid those hidden market costs.
@_date: 2018-01-14 15:26:40
This is sketchy as f*** with no context.
@_date: 2018-01-11 06:11:41
sell 0.0001 BTC, buy sharpie, buy bucket, find piece of cardboard.
"Bought bitcoin, now i'm here, please help!"
Stand on light corner.

did you not make a private key with your paper wallet?
@_date: 2018-01-11 05:39:39
show's how much i know, ha.
@_date: 2018-01-19 01:36:55
My transfer went through within 2 days, but is now pending on coinbase for about 18 hours. I'll let you know.
@_date: 2018-01-19 01:19:17
Coinbase is fine, just don't buy and sell through coinbase itself, use their free xfer to gdax and go from there... Unfortunately until LN gets implemented, everything is going to be slow.
@_date: 2018-01-12 04:05:23
i musta misremembered... didn't even think about it, heh. My point stands... 240k is still ridiculous.
@_date: 2018-01-18 10:35:43
They are not regulated to do so. I think i saw something about them offering it, but rarely following through. I would keep and excel sheet and updated every few weeks, gdax makes it's pretty easy to copy over with fill orders list.
@_date: 2018-01-19 02:07:19
got confirm from bank 18 hours ago, but still pending on the deposit.
@_date: 2018-01-13 03:07:46
xfer the BTC to me, i'll pay the fees. np np : )
@_date: 2018-01-12 04:19:15
it took roughly 12 hours a week ago.. i can't imagine it's better now.

I like how he completely skirted the major point of crypto being a normalization of wealth, and the general idea of "sticking it to the man"(however cliche that may be).
@_date: 2018-01-13 04:00:58
So when you paid $20 for the bucket was it worth it? Did you enjoy getting it for $18? How long before you realized chicken wasn't worth the $27 you paid for it?
@_date: 2018-01-18 10:12:46
It might be helpful for the panicky type to know that this week is usually the yearly low, but we've seen 2%, 2.5%, and 10+% by the end of the year for the last few years.
@_date: 2018-01-12 03:30:47
There's nothing to do. They're heavily backed up, binance opened their registration for 1 hour and got 200million new signups... i can't imagine what those guys are going through.
@_date: 2018-01-18 12:13:11
look, i'm cheaper than this guy, i'll hold onto .5 btc for you.. np np... yeah uhh, split it up! harder to lose that way! or something...
@_date: 2017-12-29 01:38:54
I think including is the wrong word. that is the one big change. Typically people were playing the market by swapping all through the alt coins and not being taxed for making money that way. On Jan 1st everytime you change coins, it's taxable.  As long as you're just switching between exchanges and not actualy currency, shouldn't trigger any taxable event this year or next.
@_date: 2017-12-30 06:13:11
in the US starting Jan, 2018, yes. Any change in $ through trades between coins will be counted as gains. If you're still trading these last couple days, you're safe to only report Capital gains for short and long term.
@_date: 2017-12-28 06:00:31
Depends on when he bought it, it may not be worth 100$ right now... and next week it could be worth 150$. i'd suggest doing some research before just cashing out.
@_date: 2017-12-30 08:45:42
seems legit.

hey, i celebrate xmas too! : P

I'm confused all i see is less than 5 cents sitting there...
@_date: 2017-12-30 06:33:43
I suggest looking up the changes to the 1031 tax law on the IRS site to make sure my wording made sense to you the right way.
@_date: 2017-12-29 08:42:25
hey that's not..... name checks out... carry on.

If they succeeed, are they really idiots?
@_date: 2018-02-04 09:02:39
it's just another demand vs availability. mempool gets full, because fees are high. Fomo and stop losses cause high volume and fill up the mempool when the price is crashing or surging. when the mempool is empty, the volume is low and the price is somewhat stable.
@_date: 2018-02-02 01:20:15
mine took around 9 days to get to coinbase, which i assume is the same banking system. (don't worry i don't use coinbase except to get money into gdax, can't get my account to connect straight to gdax)

Can confirm this is actual picture. Distance from earth directly related to value of bitcoin, obviously!
@_date: 2018-02-18 09:02:58
when it drops below 10k, i'll think about worrying again, then i'll remember, i don't care, it's just business, and continue to hodl.
@_date: 2018-02-04 12:43:48
A lot of cards offer services for lost cards ect... These banks can afford every person who sees the price drop to call them and claim their card got stolen. I'd say it's a bit of everything. Loss prevention, adoption stalling, and maybe some guilt....nope nevermind that last one.
@_date: 2018-02-18 09:09:36
What happens if it's 50 on the dot?
@_date: 2018-02-01 01:18:28
This is actually backwards. The wording was changed for like-kind exchanges to exclude cryptocurrency after Dec 31, 2017.
