Most definitely! I already sold my house and have been living in a van

Well, if Thomas Glucksmann predicts it it's bound to happen. Just sold all my possessions and maxed out my credit to go all-in!

Might want to rephrase your initial comment then. "Down overall over 20%" would imply that dividends were included in the calculation. Also it seems like you were being deliberately misleading then if you were trying to use that as anecdotal evidence of why the stock market is risky.

Difference is that US stock returns have averaged 7% over the past 150 years. So, at least in the past, if you held for long enough you'd always come out ahead. Obviously this doesn't guarantee future performance or anything, but it's a pretty solid track record.
If you had put your money into index funds instead of trying to pick individual stocks you'd be up 63% even if you invested at the peak of the market in Oct. 2007.

Uhhhhh :)
But seriously, timing the market is nearly impossible to do. Yes, the stock market will have a major correction sometime in the future. No one knows when though, could be next week or it could be in 5 years. In the meantime it could easily go up another 50% before the correction.
But yeah definitely agree with your point that the stock market is risky. It's just that compared to cryptos it's much safer imo.

Why'd you say you're down 20% then?
@_date: 2017-10-13 23:48:30
People have been saying that for 3 or 4 years and it's only been going up since then. Eventually it will correct but trying to time it barely ever works out. Definitely agree that it seems overvalued atm though.

Great looking site! The only thing I could think to improve would be to add more increments for the multiplier or possibly even let the user enter their own multiplier and have it calculate the target spin. User: spiffyspleen
