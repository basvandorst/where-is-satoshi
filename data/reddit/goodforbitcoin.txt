Even if all you posit is true and not a drug-induced pipe dream, you can't tell me that there wouldn't be people more than happy to do some enforcement work in return for some "government favors". 
That having been said, you've got some serious gaps in your logic there, mainly how the government somehow misses the boat on the entire economy flipping to bitcoin. What I can't tell is if you think the government will literally stare in the other direction for the years it would take to happen, or if you think that all of a sudden everyone *except* everyone in the government is going to wake up one day with a mass desire to suddenly move all of their goods and services to a bitcoin-based economy.

This is good for bitcoin, because:
- The first captain of industry to create an online alcohol delivery site with Bitcoin would have an easy monopoly for the entire state of Ohio!

This is good for bitcoin, because:
- When your bank closes your account down because you're scaring them, you'll be doing 100% of your business via BTC transactions and he won't be able to deny how useful they are!

"Hey, we'll let you out of prison, you just have to work for us for free for a couple months."


Ahahaha, yeah, no. It wouldn't need to shut down the internet worldwide to stop BTC from being passed around. All you have to do is go to a couple of major ISPs and say "bitcoin trading is a federal offense". The ISPs would fall over themselves blocking any popular BTC trading hub sites, blocking blockchain downloads, and so forth. You would never be able to *stop* BTC trading, but you'd certainly dissuade anyone except a very, very, *very* small fraction of people from using it.

This is good for bitcoin, because:
- The massive price drop that results from those coins being liquidated at once will greatly reduce the barrier to entry, thus allowing everyone you've convinced about BTC to get in low!

This is good for bitcoin, because:
The more people have their savings stolen entirely, the more aware people will be of how important it is to always take excessive steps to protect their wallets!

This is good for bitcoin, because:
- Every reposted article the MtGox liquidation and cross-post from will receive enough upvotes to jump onto the front page of as a proud beacon to show that someone's trying to counteract all of the downvote bots without thinking about the consequences.

Yes, the government lives paycheck to paycheck, if people stopped paying taxes then all the money it has would spontaneously evaporate, it would have absolutely no commodities anywhere, and would be completely powerless. Come on, man, you can't just stop taking your meds like this.

You do realize that if Bitcoin becomes a widely-used form of currency, the government will wise up enough to take them, right? The blockchain is completely public, it wouldn't be that hard to look at the wallet or wallets a company uses to pay for items and say "They've got more money than they're reporting they're taking in." If you start using a tumbler to launder the bitcoins, then they'll probably either subpoena the company doing the tumbling if they're in the US, or say "It's illegal for you to use this service to launder money" if they're not.
Of all the things that Bitcoin is legitimately good for, "tax evasion" isn't one of them.

This is good for bitcoin, because:
- Instead of merchants having to pay all the fees associated with credit cards and passing those costs on in the prices of items, buyers now have to shoulder the fees directly as well!
