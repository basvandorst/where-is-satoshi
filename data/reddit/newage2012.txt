Big government utopia exist in this world where you have free health care, guarantee job and pension.  I hear the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is nice this time of year. You just need to learn a little Korean.

"One thing I have learned is to slow down. Take your time. No one is going to steal your idea. It is not a race to the public view."
Tell this to Apple. We all know this is not true in terms of patents. Whoever patent an idea first owns the idea.
