This is why the coins that shall not be mentioned, can never work. Those miners run all the nodes and could get away with mining an invalid block. They are all scams to just buy more bitcoin.

He said: “I can assure you I will personally not be loaded up on bitcoin in 10 years,” Mnuchin said on CNBC’s Squawk Box. “I would bet even in five to six years I won’t even be talking about bitcoin as Treasury Secretary.”
He was talking about Bitcoin directly not Libra cause Libra can easily be shut down. Once a centralized player involved, it’s easy. It’s also why they are terrified of Bitcoin cause there is no central player to attack. 
And if they want to attack Bitcoin (I’ll use Andrea’s example): they will turn a little gecko into a Komodo dragon. 
What hasn’t killed Bitcoin has only made it stronger. China couldn’t do it even with their Firewall and if the strongest country on earth (USA) tries to attack Bitcoin, it’ll grow fangs and attack back. 
I hope they try it cause even their Congresspeople know it’s unstoppable. Make it stronger Steve than go get fired like the rest in your administration.

Thank you America for a great vacation. Met the theoretical physicists my country wanted to meet. 
It is so disturbing how far behind America is compared to the rest of the world with Bitcoin. 
Your representatives in Congress and tax agencies are destroying your potential to dominate the globe but there are other countries ready to take over. You all had a good run. Canada ���� loves you. 
Wake up and call your elected officials or forever fall behind. You have the talent. Your Congress is working on bill now we heard. It’ll just kill innovation and send America behind the most innovative technology in years. Good luck

You said inflation creates jobs aka keeps unemployment low. Inflation is a tax making that central bank issued money you work for, worth less. 
I assume your American cause most Americans don’t understand their central banking system. 
We are in Canada and are pushing for our government to offer tax incentives to get this talent from USA. It’ll be easier now that this Secretary basically declared war on these innovators who are some of the best in the world. 
If America doesn’t want the bitcoin community, we assure you many other countries, far ahead of America in this emerging technology, will gladly take this tremendous asset of people.

This maybe far out there but the few theoretical physicists we are meeting on this trip, gave the only answer to the double slit experiment we ever heard:
The universe is determinist and everything set for infinity. The universe expanded from the Big Bang and will expand until gravity becomes the dominant force pulling all particles together again in another Big Bang. They called it the big Crunch. Dark matter is pushing galaxies apart right now and is the dominate force in the universe now. 
To tie that in with bitcoin to make this a business trip, bitcoin is already set to dominate the globe. These minor price swings these new people worry about, miss the fact that the best PEOPLE are working on Bitcoin’s code. It’s more about the people than the coin cause without the devs, bitcoin is worth nothing. We trust in the devs. 
Supply is set; now we can just watch the demand side rush towards it. 
Enjoy your holiday weekend America. Wish you all would be further ahead of the curve in this most important technological and economical advancement but than again, you have the strongest force against you all: central bankers.

Big block coins are a scam to give miners more control over validating nodes.  Bcash is trash. Proven a failed experiment.  Decentralization is key to everything working with nodes validating blocks miners mine. 
What happened today, could work on big blockchains only where it’s too difficult to run a node on a huge blockchain. Bitcoin’s 1mb block limit let’s most anyone (especially merchants who need to verify) to run a node.

They schedule a recession every 10 years and it’s overdue. JP Morgan bank even said the USA dollar won’t be the reserve currency much longer.

If a country is so scared of numbers (NUMBERS!!!) being trusted over inflated fiat, it’s a house of cards and time to exit that corrupt system. I hope Canada sits back and just watches this attempt.

After thinking about this tweet more, he definitely knew what Bitcoin was for years cause his chief of staff. He wants interest rates low cause the US dollar is based on thin air. 
He knows Bitcoin is based on Proof-of-Work (PoW), and miners pay extremely high energy costs to mine a single Bitcoin. The US dollar is just printed by an authority outside democratic control. First time their central bank felt this much “political” pressure. 
Gold is based on Proof-of-Work too: scarcity and costs to mine it. That’s what gives it value. 
The US dollar is based on 1 man’s judgement (Powell’s at the moment) and is than printed out of thin air to induce debt.

You’re wrong buddy, it’s called balanced budgets. You maybe too young to remember such an time when your country, USA,  had a surplus in the 90’s. 
With balanced budgets, governments don’t need to keep borrowing. That debt (interest rates) is what creates fiat. Without debt, no need to keep borrowing but Americans can’t live within their means so they put their fiscal irresponsibility on the backs of their children and grandchildren.
USA politicians don’t like raising taxes cause the system is cyclical (every 4 years) so they devalue their dollar.
@_date: 2018-09-21 22:57:33
Will this expedite Segwit implementation? Bitcoin needs to get to 100% eventually. If this specific upgrade is mandatory, won’t segwit be included also?
Segwit which separates bitcoin from its ugly cousin. Which had the community fighting all last year on scalability and bitcoin won but Segwit is only 45%. Segwit which is needed for the Lightning Network!
If this upgrade is mandatory, why not make the inevitable 100% Segwit adoption mandatory too?!!
Segwit reduces fees and allows Lightning network and it doesn’t make sense that its not being used to the max!!

Samourai did something that we have have been waiting for in the Bitcoin community. They acknowledged that not everyone is the same and to quote them “users will never be ready”. You can read for yourself what they did. 
Bitcoin community keeps thinking all people have the time to invest in understanding all details. They don’t so they made a great decision. 
Miners will never be ready for the inevitable technological advancements coming in the next year if Segwit adoption is any example. Only 47%! 
Why does this community allow great features go forgotten? Miners just want to win the next block and will do anything to get it. 
Segwit needs to be mandated because All the work put into these advancements coming out in the next year, and to have them just sit on the sidelines cause a miner is lazy or too focused on the next block is Demoralizing to the coders and believers who put all time and effort into it. 
Lightning is the future per everyone. Are we going to let That sit unused?! Enough is enough. I know you all hate and think people will act according to the benefit of all but they don’t and won’t! You have Segwit to look on as an example which is required for Lightning.

Will this expedite Segwit implementation? Bitcoin needs to get to 100% eventually. If this specific upgrade is mandatory, won’t segwit be included also?
Segwit which separates bitcoin from its ugly cousin. Which had the community fighting all last year on scalability and bitcoin won but Segwit is only 45%. Segwit which is needed for the Lightning Network!
If this upgrade is mandatory, why not make the inevitable 100% Segwit adoption mandatory too?!!
Segwit reduces fees and allows Lightning network and it doesn’t make sense that its not being used to the max!!

All they can do is regulate the on/off ramps. They can make it difficult to exchange for fiat but in the end, that might help its growth when its forced to be used as a currency.

Let us clarify: first sign we saw in person. 
It’s from our last days in Philadelphia for work. I talked to owner of the establishment at length. He owns multiple bars around the city and said his younger customers asked to pay in bitcoin that he had no other choice cause his competition accepts Bitcoin especially on a College football Saturday or NFL Sunday. He said it’s one of the best things he did cause all the young people showed him how it works. 
As my team left, the patrons knew why we were in Philadelphia to look into a specific victim from a major case of fraud caused by a certain crypto lunatic who scammed her. 
I was informed after, that the young patrons supported our investigation to bring justice to these victims. They made the owner promise to not accept anything but bitcoin and told us everything about what this major figure aka lunatic as they called him, in the crypto community, did to their uninformed elder family members.

They both need to be brought to justice. We watched it in real time.

Under the method he just described by getting paid in Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash (very surprised btw, isn’t the limit of 21 million coin limit rendered void. Someone can issue a crypto with a trillion of coins and pay you on that as long as it’s listed on an exchange or can an atomic swap eventually? 
Also, he speaks of decentralization as most important but how can he support Bitcoin Cash which has purposely added confusion to the market and defrauded many investors on bitcoin.com using bait and switch - one of the oldest Frauds known? 
Ver’s methods border on illegal and his goal is to destroy decentralized bitcoin and replace it with Bcash. Please comment. I’m sure I’m not interpreting his goals for bitcoin incorrectly. How can you accept and support someone like Roger Ver who uses fraud and deception. He has said he hates USA and sees nothing wrong defrauding it’s citizens? 
If you do use your methodology accepting all these alt coins (some of which are openly trying to destroy bitcoin) the number of coins are infinite.

It should be 100%. There no reason a proven technology that can reduce transaction costs and devs can build second layers onto, is only 40%. I’m existing 75% till segwit is 100%. 
I just see too much inefficiency with segwit adoption. It’s a no brainer. We stayed at small block size exactly a year ago so we could adopt segwit. 
When the community gets rational, and the price drops  to $2k cause you’s can’t come together on the simplest thing such as segwit adoption, than we can support devs. 
SEGWIT WILL BE 100%!!! WHY ARE YOU PEOPLE FIGHTING IT? WE STAYED AT 1 MB TO IMPLEMENT SEGWIT AND BUILD OFF IT. ENOUGH IS ENOUGH

Segwit adoption is only 40%. Exactly 1 year ago bitcoin hardforked because Bitcoin wanted to stay decentralized and block size at 1mb because segwit could allow 4 mb blocks without giving miners the centralized power they wanted. Than China bailed after. 
The bitcoin community has the best technology but they cannot implement it. It’s ridiculous segwit is so low. 
We think China will see how inefficient the devs are at implementing segwit (a proven and unbelievable technology to build on) and Will move to enter the market again and centralize mining amount Chinese miners like prior to segwit being developed. 
If bitcoin can’t agree on segwit after a year, Lightning has no chance. 10 years in and bitcoin has not innovated cause consensus among human beings is impossible.

You need a dose of reality about human nature. They never agree on anything. Segwit should be 100% but is left on the floor like Lightning will. 
Unless Satoshi Nakamoto himself gets frustrated at this bullshit and expedites segwit than Lightning, this goal won’t be achieved till after we are all dead. 
1 year later. 8/1/2017...... we all thought Segwit would be common sense and no need to increase block size. Human nature prevailed.

I have 50 to experiment with for Canada. scope: to see if bring all mining to Canada will give it a leg up on financial commodities while USA executive branch wages tariffs on our limited exports. We thought USA like bitcoin per mick mulvaney and who they hired to run SEC. it just shows huge bureaucracy if that government can never come together to support bitcoin even when the director of the entire budget, mulvaney, can’t make any progress in 2 years. If anything, USA damaged it. We need a country to 100% take in crypto and start the revolution. Working in USA you can tell it’s just a business with indoctrination for military. Most get in, make money and get out. I’m not sure if that’s normal with superpowers but Canadians dont do that. We’ll find a friendly country soon but it’s not the USA. I did multiple internships for USA Congress. They know Ver scammed thief older citizens and I believe now that they won’t seek justice against him cause it’s too difficult dealing with Japan and Japan is proud to have a USA citizen who renounced his citizenship and said he hates America and they deserve to be scammed. 
America looked weak in this new battle and I read the letters to senators about losing money trying to buy a bitcoin for their grandchildren but Ver scammed them.  Bait and switched to Bcash. It was sad. I know my government would defend us but USA has so much going on they just wait for it to pass. Those old people lost thousands to Ver.

How’s your boy holding up? He worried he fucked up by splitting the market last year for no other reason than to benefit himself cause he wanted to get into mining and centralize power to miners. This is all his fault but he’s rich and doesn’t care. Hope he comes to USA for a talk. It’s doubtful he’ll make that talk. He was the strongest voice we had but got too selfish. Now stuck with Andreas the idealogue who hates conflicts.

Why can’t the USA just issue tax laws to clarify or go the Germany route and make them tax free for now till we know wtf this new class of currency is.

How?!! Segwit is only 40% after a year!!!!! 
Dreamers 
You need a dose of reality about human nature. They never agree on anything. Segwit should be 100% but is left on the floor like Lightning will. 
Unless Satoshi Nakamoto himself gets frustrated at this bullshit and expedites segwit than Lightning, this goal won’t be achieved till after we are all dead. 
@_date: 2018-08-19 21:16:39

Good luck with Lightning when segwit can’t even be implemented a year later. Bulls are done. 
@_date: 2018-08-01 03:03:56
It should be 100%. There no reason a proven technology that can reduce transaction costs and devs can build second layers onto, is only 40%. I’m existing 75% till segwit is 100%. 
I just see too much inefficiency with segwit adoption. It’s a no brainer. We stayed at small block size exactly a year ago so we could adopt segwit. 
When the community gets rational, and the price drops  to $2k cause you’s can’t come together on the simplest thing such as segwit adoption, than we can support devs. 
SEGWIT WILL BE 100%!!! WHY ARE YOU PEOPLE FIGHTING IT? WE STAYED AT 1 MB TO IMPLEMENT SEGWIT AND BUILF OFF IT. ENOUGH IS ENOUGH
LOGIC MUST PREVAIL..... SEGWIT WILL BE 100% DONT RESIST ABD DELAY. THE HUMAN LIFESPAN IS NO LONG ENOUGH TO DELAY GREAT TECHNOLOGY THIS LONG!!!!!!!!!!!

Dude, stfu!!! You don’t know me. I am legitimately confused and angry. I took the side of decentralization last August. I trusted Andreas and many other people with more expertise (devs).... hearing him say he accepts Bcash last week devastated us. He said he never claimed his BCH cause they could track him but also he believes in 2nd layers with segwit. 
Don’t judge me you troll. Get a life. You have no idea the shit I seen and letters I read from the older generation to their congressional representatives. That was our internship cause we knew crypto. The letters were so disheartening but I don’t expect anyone here to care. You’s are just money money money. These people  just wanted to buy a bitcoin for their grandchildren and went to Ver’s site and bought the wrong coin than transferred it to a bitcoin address!!! So F off..., Ver only recently changed his website:

Remember that bitcoin works as a currency no matter the price. Earn bitcoin at any price makes no difference. People still count the 21 million. 1 bitcoin is divisible multiple times. All currency is relative to something. Bitcoin is relative to fiat at the moment. If price drops, you can still earn it, than hold it or exchange it. 
It has a difficulty adjustment to make it fair for all miners but even if a few miners are around, Bitcoin will always run according to the algorithm for over hundred years.

@_date: 2018-08-01 03:29:28
That’s the opposite. I’m saying get out. We fought a battle to stay at 1mb blocks and stay decentralized exactly a year ago. Segwit is needed for second layers. The community has abandoned segwit and left it on the floor. 
What’s the point of development if the community ignores it. I think China will see bitcoin’s inefficiency of adoption and get back in so mining becomes centralized in China again. This community failed to live up to 1mb blocks and segwit that it promised. 
@_date: 2018-08-07 23:48:31
Than why does he accept them?! 
He claims to be pacifist. I guess that’s why he is so avoidance of what even goes against his vision. Is Ver was pushing bitcoin instead of btrash, he found at least put up a fight. 
I feel the coins are just doubled now. Useless if someone like Andreas will accept them against his strong beliefs in decentralization. He wanted 1mb blocks!! He wanted segwit. He doesn’t fight like Ver does albeit Ver is most likely going to jail. 
@_date: 2018-05-18 03:46:13
Andreas refuses to take an opinion. He even said to buy  Bcash is that’s what you want. Than he says that Lightning and decentralized is the way to go. I got involved because of him than it’s hard to judge his views cause he won’t admit Bcash is centralized cause he hates the fighting. 
That’s what happens in an innovative market and wish he’d be stronger and say Lightning and decentralized is Better like he does privately. 
@_date: 2018-08-07 01:55:57
Bcash is defrauding people through bait and switch. He calls BCH the real bitcoin. He doesn’t support Bitcoin. Why would anyone especially Andreas support Ver’s coin?! The guy’s a con man. 
Is the issue that technically that law enforcement can’t understand what he’s doing. The guy is a scum bag. He deserves to pay a fine and possible jail time. He knew what he was doing when he revoked his USA citizenship. Now we have to ask Japan to deal with him.

The Biggest Story that may bring trust back for this generation to try bitcoin again is if Armstrong answers why he added Roger Ver’s Bcash during bitcoin mania middle December 2017. Than Roger Ver does the bait and switch so people thought they were buying bitcoin but were really buying Bcash in Ver’s domain Bitcoin.com site. 
They both need to be brought to justice. We watched it in real time. 
They added so much confusion listed two coins named Bitcoin that the market couldn’t recover from that. One day it’s bitcoin, Ethereum and litecoin. Next day they see two Bitcoins listed. They sold and said this is stupid.

Do you think the big blockers won after a year. Segwit adoption under 50%; its 40% I think. 
It’s a sad day for us (my trading team and I) who believed in segwit than Lightning than mass adoption. 
Over a decade in...... we will continue to hodl but the pace is so slow, we are just doing it for our children. Why delay the inevitable... it doesn’t make sense. The fight we all went through to stay decentralized and 60% (actually more cause it was only 20% Segwit in December) of the community decided to do nothing which increased fees to all time levels. Time to re-evaluate the commitment the community has. Andreas tells us to stay in but why delay the inevitable adoption? We all upgraded our wallets to Segwit in half a day as instructed. I’m at a loss. Slackers 
You will all bash my comment and me; and I understand hope. Keep hope.

That’s cool and all but if think the price is going up, why spend it? It’s a catch 22. They price would have to go so high that people don’t mind getting rid of a few satoshis.  It’s a great store of wealth right now but the goal is currency via Lightning network. 
@_date: 2018-08-07 01:47:14

@_date: 2018-05-26 01:14:53
Agree but it was the inevitable end point and the market played games not implementing it sooner which caused fees to rise in December so high, it became useless. We all know Lightning is needed if bitcoin will reach full potential. It needs segwit. If it’s obviously the right direction and only miners are resistant cause they can make more on fees while destroying the market and technology, it should be brought to consensus of 95% which all agree. 
People will only give technology a certain number of attempts before they move on and a bad reputation lasts. That’s human nature. No more ideology all... if we know what the end point is, where it has to go to be successful, no more games in between!!

I’m not Bcash supporter at all. I actually know people working with the Japanese embassy to have Ver come before a house sub-committee to answer questions on bait and switch tactics which defrauded a lot of the older generations. (Allegedly)
I am all in for Bitcoin but scale ability isn’t we’re we need it now. The market never lies. Once it’s ready, the sky is the limit. We all play out part. I am relying on the devs to hopefully have bitcoin retail ready by end of year. I will do my part in keeping confusion out of the market and the likes of Roger Ver will not be part of this technology’s future if he continues his tactics. That is guaranteed. 
You will hear about it soon around July what the investigation has turned up. For the devs, please keep doing what you do best and we are year to support you.

I heard Andreas Antonopoulos speaks in Panama. The simplest thing such as an easy user interface could have a huge impact. We are focused on code and under-the-hood stuff but if the average person can’t use the code, it’s useless. A technology with no users is a waste of time. 
Where’s the graphic designers?! We need help getting our code out to the masses. Lightning is getting there but when main-net wallets are too complicated, how are we going to let them use a Lightning wallet. 
We need a fund, to raise funding for new designers and devs (of course) or we are in limbo for years. 
The internet was brought mainstream faster cause they knew instinctively that it had to be made simple. Apple iPhone too. Making technology simple is key to mainstream. The product is there but hidden. Let’s make it easy and expose it so they would be crazy not to use it like Steve Jobs did and so many early internet developers.

Ethereum will have adoption 3-5 years after bitcoin hits its full adoption. There is no utility to Ethereum now and we will all get plenty more opportunities to buy it even cheaper. It’s great for 1000 people who code. 
Bitcoin needs adoption first. Bcash needs to be destroyed as a warning and punishment and than us pre-early adopters (not speculators) will reap the benefits. Too much dumb money in the market like Nick Szabo said most of it in shit coins specifically Bcash. 
Bitcoin market cap needs to approach 70-75% followed by Ethereum than litecoin which can act as a Lightning payment channel on ramp with atomic swaps. That’s all that is needed. 
Let the dumb money be lost. Majority of it all flows up.

The whole reason they hardforked instead of contributing to bitcoin, was proven they screwed up allowing miners that much power. 
Bcash will find out next with that huge block size increase. Those miners owners Bcash. Just a matter of time. 
It’s so sad too, all these devs could be focusing on the true goal of decentralization instead of $$$$$$. 
@_date: 2018-08-01 05:14:39
So sad a year later. We thought Segwit would be 100% and Lightning up and running. Human life span is not that long. If you want to enjoy the freedom bitcoin offers, STOP resisting the technology that will eventually be implemented. 
You are fighting against technology that will be used and is needed for second layer solution. The bitcoin core tried the diplomatic way but this technology will succeed better without you holding it back. As soon as Segwit and Lightning are 100%..... no more alt coins. 
Adopt the inevitable so you can live to see the revolution it brings, if not and you continue to delay what is definitely going to be implemented into the BIP.  
We didn’t fight to stay decentralized for you people to drag your feet and not implement superior technology. Adopt Segwit. Stop being greedy for high fees.

I’m not Bcash supporter at all. I actually know people working with the Japanese embassy to have Ver come before a house sub-committee to answer questions on bait and switch tactics which defrauded a lot of the older generations. (Allegedly)
I am all in for Bitcoin but scale ability isn’t we’re we need it now. The market never lies. Once it’s ready, the sky is the limit. We all play our part. I am relying on the devs to hopefully have bitcoin retail ready by end of year. I will do my part in keeping confusion out of the market and the likes of Roger Ver will not be part of this technology’s future if he continues his tactics. That is guaranteed. 
You will hear about it soon around July what the investigation has turned up. For the devs, please keep doing what you do best and we are here to support you.

Beautiful concept. It’s needed now with users. Answer me this please :
The Biggest Story that may bring trust back for this generation to try bitcoin again is if Armstrong answers why he added Roger Ver’s Bcash during bitcoin mania middle December 2017. Than Roger Ver does the bait and switch so people thought they were buying bitcoin but were really buying Bcash in Ver’s domain Bitcoin.com site. 
They both need to be brought to justice. We watched it in real time. 
They added so much confusion listed two coins named Bitcoin that the market couldn’t recover from that. One day it’s bitcoin, Ethereum and litecoin. Next day they see two Bitcoins listed. They sold and said this is stupid. 
Than Andreas says he accepts BCH in his YouTube channel last week, for payment for talks. He abandons decentralization we all fought for. That Statement by him, doubled the coin size to 42 million and demonstrates there is no max supply. 
@_date: 2018-05-26 01:04:49

I feel for you people. I wish you knew the evil he’s capable of. He has bitcoin but that wasn’t good enough. He wanted to ruin it instead of work on it. Roger was given a psychological review at his arrest. Bottom line, he doesn’t like when system such as governments or Bitcoin for example are working properly. (I can name so many more he said)
He has a messiah complex. To ruin everything than come in as the savior. Don’t fall for his act. I wish I can tell more but by August you all know. 
@_date: 2018-05-05 01:08:22
Agreed. The tech is ready for massive adoption yet. Lightning needs to fully implemented which is hard when segwit is only 38%. 
@_date: 2018-08-01 03:21:06
Nice !!! Bitcoin is done for 10 years. They can’t even adopt their own technology like segwit. Consensus has never worked. Lightning needs segwit btw and segwit is only 40%. Peace.... we are out here.

Easy way to bypass credit card block. Use a bovado like site which all credit cards love cause they get paid if you win and get to sue if you don’t. 
Than withdrawal immediately into a bitcoin address. Not Bcash account cause miners can reverse it. Bcash is centealized ...... works every time. I buy all my bitcoin this way cause credit cards screwed me my entire life buying college books and food. Our turn to turn the tables. They love gambling sites than withdrawal to a hardware wallet. Money is untouchable.

Bcash is being investigated not Bitcoin. Bcash used bait and switch tactics and scammed newbies and older people out of millions while adding confusion and distrust to the market. This Federal Investigation is needed so people trust bitcoin again and are protected from people like Roger Ver who thinks he’s protected cause he lives in Japan. I am telling you now, the state Department is talking to Japan to extradite to USA. Trust me on this. Once it’s completed by August at the latest, Bcash will be proven a scam and roger will be before a senate subcommittee and he can’t plead the fifth cause he denounced his USA citizenship after the Waco Texas incident and he was buying bomb material. 
Bitcoin will become stronger after Bcash and roger are exposed as well as fake Nakamoto in Florida courts. 
Andreas Antonopoulos is such a powerful voice. We just wish he would stand up and confront these scammers. He doesn’t like confrontation and I guess he’s grateful for the millions he got after roger made fun of him.

They guy is screwed. He can’t plead the fifth neither cause he said he hates USA and disavowed his citizenship, when the state department gets him before a subcommittee. Don’t doubt me on this. I’ll tell you more once he’s on US soil. He bought bomb making material after Waco. He’s not very bright. He wants to hurt the USA as much as possible. Japan will extradite him by August. Bcash scammed slot of money from the America who vote and write their representatives. I promise you. I’m retiring from the Agency soon. I’ll be open cause I like the tech.

Anyway my nephew is 13 and knows the difference. I am very happy about this upcoming generation. Him and his friends taught me more about bitcoin than I ever could have read. They can’t even open bank accounts. If we stay out of this generation’s way, they will change the world for the better but Roger Ver scamming new older entries into the market will be stopped in the U.S.  that is guaranteed.

Do you want bitcoin to become highly regulated and banned from exchanges? 
Ok, he fulfilled his libertarian dream for awhile. People are dying daily cause they can’t control addiction. It’s human nature. Many good people who would advanced human evolution, died from that flaw in human evolution to continue doing what feels good. 
We have no problem with guy and he’s definitely not going to spend life in prison. That was just a warning for others. He’ll be out eventually. 
Bitcoin needs to separate itself from that cause majority of human population don’t want that association. Monero is taking care of their needs now and is being thrown off exchanges all over the world. 
Do you really want that to happen to bitcoin which has a higher potential now than just getting people to kill brain cells? Bitcoin has the potential to be a trusted currency and free people from central banks all over the world. 
People like you who continue to focus on drugs, are feeding the bankers exactly what they want. You’re discrediting bitcoin for them and enslaving humanity further. Go use a privacy coin but stop this negative association and working for big banks.

Bottom-line, the predictable financial model of Bitcoin is better than just randomly raising interest rates based on the judgement of a human being.

You are viewing the term “job” incorrectly. Job can be raising kids, having a kid, mowing the lawn, fixing the roof etc... it’s not the 9-5 job you are thinking about. Economists always struggle to find value for those jobs to incorporate into the GDP. Music and art has to be taken into account also. The time invested by a human is finite. Time and an individual’s use of it is measured. 
Bottom-line, human beings need something to give their life purpose. No one would want AI taking over every aspect of life while they get a universal Income based on the job AI is doing. That’s the dilemma in the next century with AI on the horizon; If it doesn’t do what Elon Musk thinks and destroy human life. Quantum computing would happen first but there are only 100 Qubits in existence so that’s a decade away at least.

Stephen Moore, Trump’s new pick to the FED, this guy is the biggest critic of the Fed. He believes the FED should act more like the GAO not be completely private and more accountable. The Fed has to be more like the GAO. 
Private banks shouldn’t be able to shock the economy by raising interest rates overnight to benefit a small rich minority. People love Bitcoin’s model cause you can plan its supply by the block rewards reduction every four years so you can plan your financial security for 20,30,60,100 years. No surprises in bitcoin. 
Plus the USA government works for the people. They should lend money at zero % and not be benefiting off its citizens. Other countries without central banks, did that and the economy grew. The central banks hated it. 
Stephen Moore is the warning shot the FED needs. Look at the USA’s GAO. Similar charter but they don’t profit off it.

Segwit was one of the main reasons for the hardfork last August. I understand that Bitcoin has to be attacked in order to continue to survive and supply trust. A hardfork is the hardest thing it could encounter next to the mt gox hack. 
Bitcoin decided to stay at 1mb and implement innovative technology such as Segwit and Lightning (which only works with Segwit). If the Bitcoin community does not use these innovations, it is just btrash which just increases block sizes and centralizes  miners. 
It has yet to recover from that hardfork if Segwit isn’t implemented.

I understand what you’re saying. Economists was my major and I worked in the USA as an intern for 2 years. 
The way you describe it has a time delay which is not needed. The younger generation will demand speed and not wait for what central authorities (FED) have to say about it. Time is a natural blockchain which decentralized technology can attach to. The FED served its purpose whether for good or bad is subjective. We have a higher technology that can govern all: Time. 
Using time as a currency with hashrate proof of work, will and does work better than 12 central banks deciding on interest rates and how much US dollars to print. It’s amazing my neighbors to the south chase US $ like no other but then outsource it’s production to 12 banks.

It’s documented and his days are numbered.

They are running out of FUD so they are recycling the old climate change FUD. If they demonstrated how much clean energy Bitcoin uses in cold environments to heat houses, compared to the banking’s carbon footprint which just gets wasted along with the cost of mining gold, people would be amazed. 
Clean energy is being used to heat homes with mining machines. Banks just waste the energy.

This has to be addressed at the federal level before local level. Receiving bitcoin is purposely difficult in the USA  for tax purposes.

This stability is great. People from 2 years ago who wouldn’t let me show them Bitcoin, are willing to use its ease as a currency. Plus Segwit is being implemented. 
Bitcoin is evolving. Soon Segwit will be 100% (it’s inevitable) and technologies like Lightning will build off Segwit. Everyone will be able to run a node! 
It was smart to keep bitcoin at 1mb. Developers stepped up and continue to. 
Bitcoin will be the most decentralized crypto coin. Btrash will fade away with the rest. Everyone can’t run a full btrash node cause cause it’s too large. I just use a laptop for my node. Everyone will be able to verify the rules on their own.

Segwit was one of the main reasons for the hardfork last August. Why is it only 45%?  I understand that Bitcoin has to be attacked in order to continue to survive and supply trust. A hardfork is the hardest thing it could encounter next to the mt gox hack. 
Bitcoin decided to stay at 1mb and implement innovative technology such as Segwit and Lightning (which only works with Segwit). If the Bitcoin community does not use these innovations, it is just btrash which just increases block sizes and centralizes  miners. 
It has yet to recover from that hardfork if Segwit isn’t implemented.

Invest as you will. You worked to earn that money to invest. I agree last year was a debacle especially when USA’s biggest exchange decided to randomly add btrash without telling anyone. It sent mistrust throughout the market that will take years to recover from. Plus you have an asshole forking bitcoin into btrash and making a fool of himself and committing fraud which is still under investigation with his bait and switch on a bitcoin website. 
If you notice, the market reacted as it should have. Now once Ver is brought to justice and trust is established again, the market can continue on its path. People like him are just pure shit stealing and taking advantage of new investors. He will have to pay for his crimes if people trust the market again. 
It always makes us feel disappointed if bitcoin never forked last year: It would be so much stronger but not everyone can play nice. Segwit and Lightning were going to happen no matter what. It’s evolution. He wanted to disrupt it and boy did he. More than anyone could have predicted. Once Btrash is revealed to be a shit coin with no innovation and Ver faces justice for his crimes, bitcoin can continue its evolution and innovation.

I understand what you’re saying. Economists was my major and I worked in the USA as an intern for 2 years. 
The way you describe it has a time delay which is not needed. The younger generation will demand speed and not wait for what central authorities (FED) have to say about it. Time is a natural blockchain which decentralized technology can attach to. The FED served its purpose whether for good or bad is subjective. We have a higher technology that can govern all: Time. 
Using time as a currency with hashrate proof of work, will and does work better than 12 central banks deciding on interest rates and how much US dollars to print. It’s amazing my neighbors to the south chase US $ like no other but then outsource it’s production to 12 banks.

Bitcoin’s open source technology is being adopted faster by other coins. It’s frustrating for coders to work on something for a purpose only to be used by another project instead of the intended. We feel for the devs and hope they keep their moral up. Segwit version 0 is only 50%.

Bitcoin is about to be taxed by the irs and they will jail the people who didn’t report capital gains just as an example and warning to others. I seen the bill. Bitcoin has not privacy. Andreas lied to us in the beginning and hoped the problem would be fixed by now Last I tweeted him. He can’t promote privacy coins after congress testimony or he can be jailed the system he is trying to exit. Privacy coins are true cash. No trace, no tax, lower supply, higher potential.

No one in the USA is going to go fully in till the IRS issues proper taxing guidelines. They are purposely keeping it vague. 
If the Trump administration is so worried about China’s power over the market, they should do what Germany did and not tax it till the market is mature enough. 
Miners in the USA get taxed at earned income tax rates which is approximately 30% depending on tax bracket. THAN, when they sell it, it gets taxed at capital gains rates!! 
Who would want to mine in the USA?!! No shit that China has 80% of the hash rate. If they truly believe it’s a security risk having China control so much hashing power, don’t tax it like that.  Either way, the government is going to be forced to make a decision when one of these mining farms in the USA takes the IRS to court. Than the courts will dictate the regulations. They are just “kicking the can” to another agency. They don’t want bitcoin to mature and will do everything to hold it back till it’s too late. Germany is the place to be.

Why is Bitcoin so conservative with their technical upgrades. Bitcoin said at 1mb so miners don’t have too much power over nodes. Miners will always be there no matter what. They just chase the auto issuance of bitcoin every 10 minutes. If they drop out, difficulty adjustment takes place. Do miners aren’t that significant. They do as told. 
Segwit came out over a year ago. Why can’t nodes who control the consensus rules, mandate segwit?! It’s going to happen eventually; it’s better tech; it’s needed to scale for Lightning. It’s only at 40% after s year!!
Why? Bitcoin is developing at a snails pace in a rapidly evolving world. Mandate Segwit! Get Lightning operational so when Bitcoin gets its second chance this November, people are paying $50 fees again! 
Bitcoin will only get a certain amount of chances for the masses to test it.

Gold and storage assets don’t appreciate much cause it serves one purpose. It’s all bitcoin turned into. No one used them for commerce. It’ll drop to store of wealth value which is not much further and it will be there when the rich need it during a recession here or there but HODL and no Lightning to make it useable, plus it’s traceable  which means taxable. The unbanked as andreas and all the maximalist say, will continue unbanked. You need an ID to buy into the market. Andreas is a dreamer. We need dreamers but not in a multi billion dollar industry. He is a great person who hopes but doesn’t live in reality. I met him many times and talked to him. Nothing negative out of his mouth that doesn’t have a solution but he assumes too much. He exited the system years ago. Not everyone wants to exit the the system. We can’t. We have families. He lead many down a bad path I feel. He thinks everyone can pick up and exit the USA financial system that easily. We wish. Privacy would help but he can’t push privacy coins after testifying at Congresses. 
When it achieves true cash like status and private fully, the government will fight it like they are with other privacy coins now which dark web users actually use. Bitcoin lost its path. It’s a sad time. Luckily we are rich from bitcoin already but we wanted to see it succeed. Bcash just added confusion. Ver should be in jail.

Well when you have bests devs and top people in all fields from marketing to psychology to artists and finance, etc.... why would you direct people to another project. Cause you may not prefer bitcoin (you have to respect the people it has working on it), it’s going to be the standard on any future crypto project. When that project gets the unbelievable TALENT that is working on bitcoin, than you can complain about equal time for all others. 
I don’t understand how a project such as bitcoin is not good enough for the type of person you describing? 
The infrastructure and dedication and support from these people who could work on any project or for any company they want at any salary they want, is not enough sign to people of what the future is going to be because these devs are the ones who will create it.

China is the USA biggest creditor. They could flood the market with US Treasuries which would cause their ability to borrow additional money to fund their debt more expensive. China bought a lot of gold last year and now their views have “softened” on Bitcoin. They will come for Bitcoin next than flood the market with US Treasuries increasing interest rates by a foreign power.

He does go too far sometimes in his speeches. If he rehearsed them first rather than doing them on the fly, some of the things he says that are considered impossible to do in life, wouldn’t have been said. For example, not everyone can just “exit” a country cause bitcoin exists. Not everyone is technically capable of understanding the technology that comes so easily to him. 
Wish he’d take a day or 2 to plan his speeches rather than winging it. He’d have much more credibility cause you can see the spots he’s improvising that just popped in his head without proper evaluation. 
Another example is his back and forth on privacy: base layer or second layer. He says he can be persuaded either way in that case but than gives definitive answer during speeches. 
He’s a great educator. I’m not taking anything away from that but a little rehearsal could help everyone especially since this is the role he chose for his life.

Only 15% of Bitcoin’s supply left to be mined over the next 120 years. Plus 3-4 million coins lost forever including Satoshi’s (most likely). 
Those facts put things in total perspective just as the older generations are doing everything they can to stay in power (everything that everyone in the upcoming generation knew they would do). Timing is perfect. 
The most interesting FACT is that the main users, innovators, etc... ARE NOT EVEN BORN YET!!!

He’s already trying to apologize and changed his website. That’s not enough. Plus he can’t plead the fifth without jail time. His website confused older people and they are furious. I’ll tell you how I know after this goes down. It’s ashame cause he was respected but decided he wanted to go back to his messiah complex. If he stuck with bitcoin, he would have had to wait a year but he could have helped so much. Now he’s going to answer for his crime and he weakened bitcoin and set it back 2 years.

The main problem is confidence that was damaged in December. We spent years trying to get people to just try it and they finally did and paid $50 to transfer $2 to their family as a test. Currency cannot exist without trust. It’s why the $ can be printed with ease, TRUST! 
This may take a generation to recover from. The lag in the technology may need that time. The devs got rich and bounced it looks like. Never seen anything take so long to develop. The internet was developed faster.

This technology is important. We are not coders so don’t know the difficulty but 9 year development seems long to develop anything. Internet from 93 to 03. Same time frame. I know switching to a new currency or even just a store if value if that’s the aim, is difficult cause human beings work (give time of their lives) for the currency they exchange for goods and services.  
A lot of people gave it a chance and fees skyrocketed. This has to be grass roots before mainstream. Lightning per all information out there is not ready for prime time. At this rate, it will be the next generation willing to give bitcoin another chance but that maybe enough. I just wished I could live to see decentralization of banking. This pace of development......... I don’t know what to say. Everyone has theories but no one knows and anything you say is a guess. Maybe too many early holders to trust a currency owned by so few. Lightning would alleviate that mistrust allowing micropayments but segwit is only 40% adoption at best. Humans are not patient species. 
@_date: 2018-06-20 04:58:00
Bitcoin has reached bottom. Everyone thinks they need a whole coin and still don’t understand you can buy partial. The lower it goes, the more people enter and brag to their neighbor they have bitcoin. 
It’s not dropping much further. 
We now wait on the devs to make the technology useful. 
The next generation who will really use it can’t afford it (the way they think) but if the devs get a better UI and better way to store rather than coinbase which is mind numbing how they anyone could store on an exchange! 
When hardware Lightning wallets sales start to pick up, we are there. Current generation can’t think about that but their 5-7 year olds will when they are doing banking in school via lightning wallet apps. 
And I hope moms get their daughters into Lightning wallets so it’s not 95% male and all can partake in this decentralization.

When (not if) central banks of the world start buying Bitcoin, it won’t be announced. It’ll happen suddenly with only a handful of people knowing. 
No one knows what’s on the USA FED’s balance sheet (largest most powerful central bank in the world).
They will want to decrease the available supply to the average citizens and foreign actors, which is good for holders. It’s the only way they can control bitcoin and they are finally realizing the threat bitcoin is to their power. 
It’ll happen in a 15-20 minute span and that supply they buy will be locked away forever like they did with gold in Fort Knox: Executive Order 6102. That won’t work with this generation and the digital nature of Bitcoin (you can’t break into a human mind to get their keys).  
It’s going to happen before the halvening as they see it undervalued till than.

Well when you have bests devs and top people in all fields from marketing to psychology to artists and finance, etc.... why would you direct people to another project. Cause you may not prefer bitcoin (you have to respect the people it has working on it), it’s going to be the standard on any future crypto project. When that project gets the unbelievable TALENT that is working on bitcoin, than you can complain about equal time for all others. 
I don’t understand how a project such as bitcoin is not good enough for the type of person you describing? 
The infrastructure and dedication and support from these people who could work on any project or for any company they want at any salary they want, is not enough sign to people of what the future is going to be because these devs are the ones who will create it.

True, why does China bit like bitcoin when they have all the miners. That is too centralized. The nodes are the only thing keeping it centralized.

@_date: 2019-08-23 23:05:39
It’s simple supply and demand economics. Less supply with increased demand and miners, equals higher price. It’s so f’in simple. It’s good the old holders from 2011-2015 are selling now. It’ll bring in new holders with new cost basis.

I said a month ago this investigation was coming. It is not about bitcoin. It’s roger Ver located in Japan. My wife works for the subcommittee that is working with the state department to get him to America via U.S. Marshalls who on ready to go when Japan embassy says it’s a go. They had to make it public before they charge roger Ver. Coinbase and roger Ver in December negotiated an addition of Bcash to coinbase in the middle of the night which added confusion and started the downward tread. Everyone who sees bitcoin this low, jump on board cause bitcoin is not being investigated, roger is. Bitcoin is at a discount now. I’m posting on this “daily tread” cause Reddit erases it at midnight and I won’t get in trouble spilling government goal. Roger is done. Anyone who followed my advice saved up for this drop.

Complain about taxing a new technology. They adopted “do no harm” as with the internet which enjoyed tax-free status to start. Germany has adopted the same approach. 
In Germany, Bitcoin and other cryptos are not considered as a commodity, a stock, or any kind of currency. Instead, these things are considered as private money in a way that’s similar to foreign currency.
Trading bitcoins/altcoins are considered as a private sale under the rule 23 EStG which has tax-free benefits.

Everything is relative to another thing. You are making bitcoin which is math and predictable supply relative to fiat? Why? Fiat will keep getting printed non-stop. 
Bitcoin’s supply is fixed and it’s inflation rate laid out. So, if you are worried about it relative to fiat, it’ll always increase as the supply of fiat increases. 
You just need to judge the demand side of price economics and all indications are that the younger generation prefer bitcoin. And they will tell their kids too. So demand will increase.

They spent billions on studies trying to understand how millennials function so they could try to exploit them. It didn’t work out well cause millennials and their future children appreciate life and refuse to be controlled. It’s that simple. 
They are the smartest generation and everyone needs their knowledge but if you treat them like an 80’s office worker, they will leave without saying bye with all the knowledge you need to sustain your retirement. 
They want bitcoin and not central bank money. Their best coders are working on it. The USA dollar is not the world currency any more. Nobody told these 50+ year olds yet.

The gold supply can be massively inflated with new technology. Look at this asteroid that has more gold than earth. And all it’ll take is a SpaceX rocket or some other asteroid mining company, to direct it to earth and pick up the pieces. 
With the right company, they can destroy the gold market in a decade. What’s the point of gold though if it’s not scarce anymore. 
We are going to space. These precious metals will be easy as sending a rocket to move it’s orbit a little and have it burn up in the atmosphere and collect the inside treasure. We can time it within millionth of a second. Amazing.

In the next two decades, we are working on quantum mechanics. Take the USA’s probe that was launched in the 70’s and exited the solar system 2 years ago. It takes hours to communicate with it. We are setting up “easy tech” that uses significantly less gbits. They will work alongside computers cause the human brain can only process information alot slower than the speed of light. All you with have to do is observe it which shrinks the wave function instantly. Communication will be instant. Breakthrough coming soon just need these USA’s celebrities whose need for purpose isn’t evolved as the technology. Electricity won’t be needed to communicate. Just looking/observing/ measuring. 
It must be bad for these USA celebrity actors. The women do scenes that no mother would approve they call it art so they are suckered into it. Than once the world sees them embarrass themselves, they need a true purpose in life and take on global warming or God knows what. They don’t know that future generations got everything under control just like we do from prior industrial revolution worries. Hollywood in the USA will keep exploiting these attention seeking people. They lack purpose in life and are desperate. Go to them for funding of bitcoin startups if their Hollywood bosses let them.

Cash is the most popular and private “bearer instrument” (whoever holds the paper, owns it). As the world moves to cashless societies, bitcoin will be the cash equivalent. Let’s get this user interface improved as next year’s elections will give more power to officials who won’t have to worry about certain voting blocs anymore and can implement these cashless provisions.

Thought for today: we have seen a steady rise in chain analytics companies and the price Governments and other companies are willing to pay for their services. Just take a look at Coinbase’s purchase of Neutrino (look at this company if you get time today; very unsettling). 
This fact is why we need privacy over scale sooner rather later cause it will get harder and harder later. The goal is for internet cash. I know transaction fees are getting out of hand during certain sessions but the time maybe now to focus on the harder issue of privacy cause that’s going to be the biggest push back from governments and all these companies who are making so much money selling it to everyone and who are getting more powerful in this sector. 
It has to be done at the base layer before adding second layer and Lightning is progressing fast. If not done soon, this current state will be part of Bitcoin forever. 
Privacy is a Right.

Ideas like this will be the next billion dollar ideas in this young industry.
Countries want to go cashless and millennials don’t trust central bank issued paper due to inflation and counterfeiting which leads to increased supply and devaluation of their labor. 
All things point to Bitcoin as the dominate currency once the user interface is improved, and security and privacy enhancements are adopted for less tech savvy users. 
The current non-believers think that Bitcoin is static. They don’t realize the improvements on the horizon as every coder in the world works on bitcoin as a hobby in some form. These non-believers are mostly older people who control enormous sums of “old money” and cannot comprehend the coming revolutionary ideas and do not want to admit their reign is coming to an end: TIME IS UNDEFEATED!

Define money. Money is just the exchange of an individual’s labor. That’s it. An advanced barter system that humans decided a precious metal, due to its scarcity and hard to steal, would work as a medium of exchange. 
Banks than exploited that system and were given control of the medium of exchange of a person’s labor/time. 
Time is all we have in the end as a human being. And it’s time to pick a better medium of exchange that is finally free of central bank manipulation/control.

When the debt bubble burst next year and inflation skyrockets in the USA, that will happen there as well. The middle class isn’t feeling the inflation yet cause the rich are hoarding the money they get first from the FED. Just look at how high the luxury items increased in price just this last year... first class business plane tickets to Europe, yachts, etc... 
Once the middle class gets that surplus money, they will know what inflation feels like. It’s the result of keeping interest rates artificially low so Trump gets re-elected.

You separate people. Humans are in Government as a job, laborers are building, Coders are coding. Your view of humanity is so limited. You know your job but do you know what others are. 
You are viewing the term “job” incorrectly. Job can be raising kids, having a kid, mowing the lawn, fixing the roof etc... it’s not the 9-5 job you are thinking about. Economists always struggle to find value for those jobs to incorporate into the GDP. Music and art has to be taken into account also. The time invested by a human is finite. Time and an individual’s use of it is measured. 
Bottom-line, human beings need something to give their life purpose. No one would want AI taking over every aspect of life while they get a universal Income based on the job AI is doing. That’s the dilemma in the next century with AI on the horizon; If it doesn’t do what Elon Musk thinks and destroy human life. Quantum computing would happen first but there are only 100 Qubits in existence so that’s a decade away at least.

Your statement is subjective just like the trust the US $ is based on.

To each his own but a new generation is coming that will have the option to trust 12 central bankers (humans with all flaws) or universal Math.

Bitcoin is conservative in its implementation. It’s there for people to use. 
When you get past the BS, the ultimate currency is human labor and what we are willing to exchange it for. The barter system worked until the human population exploded. Next, Gold was scarce and hard to steal so that worked for a time (gold had a built in proof of work system since you had to mine it which WAS labor intensive). Than humans decided paper representing gold would suffice but the trust was impossible to verify. 
We are now in the current era deciding what to base our medium of exchange of labor on. 
Bitcoin is the answer. It’s based on universal math which can never lose trust and is scarce and hard to steal like gold (if you protect your keys). 
But the ultimate currency is an individual’s labor and what we choice to exchange our time for. 
Math=trust, programmable scarcity, individual ownership. Consensus!

Canadian authorities are on his market manipulation already. Australia just lets him run his mouth which is listened to, sad to say. Australia definitely the land down under. 
Bitcoin was challenged this week like all the contributors say it has to be so that it becomes stronger. The events this week show it’s not strong and a small few people control majority of it and they left the market from fear. 
The real satoshi team needs to step up to stop this animal from be able to continue to manipulate the market. He restricts his travel now knowing he’s going to be “detained”. Florida filed suit but he won’t show and Australia and Japan don’t extradite their citizens.

Any timetable you can provide buddy? I come from a generation that gets instant gratification. My peers are turning to centralized coins after last year’s fee debacle. They don’t care about the technology; just transferring and using money on the internet as fast and cheaply as possible. 
It’s dangerous using them centralized coins and goes against everything bitcoin is meant for. Bitcoin is TEN years old. The community thinks expedition of technology is bad. Humans can accomplish anything when we put our minds to it. We went to the moon in under a decade; split the atom to win wwii in time. Expedition of a technology is not bad and I fear the technology has been too sluggish for the younger generation who cannot afford $30 fees. It’s time this technology steps up or it’s going to lose outright which is not desired by anyone!!
I want to fund this technology cause each generation after mine will continue to want faster and cheaper. 
@_date: 2018-11-19 22:44:43
Where is Andreas Antonopolous or Greg Maxwell when we need them? 
I wish Andreas wasn’t a pacifist when 4 people are destroying the technology he loves.  
He could easily talk to the average non-technical person to demonstrate the obvious. Rather than just say give compassion during time to people losing money. 
Nature doesn’t work that way. Use your god given ability to talk and decentralize bitcoin again from these 4 men. 
@_date: 2018-11-29 03:26:32
Going on 11 years and the only cheers come from speculators. 
When it becomes useful and accepted by businesses as we tried last November/December and fees are not higher than the commerce being performed, than Greg M is right on scale. If not, 11 years is a long time relative to technology. We need to keep spreading the word. 
“The squeaky wheel gets the grease” and the best devs are content to not be squeaky. It’d be great if they were out there every day explaining what they are working on to everyone including most importantly (high schools) but their void has given way to louder squeaks who, per human nature, will be trusted cause someone actually talked to them. 
@_date: 2018-11-05 23:00:32
Keeping block sizes small, allows for innovation such as second layer solutions like Segwit which will lead to The Lightning Network and so on, and keep Bitcoin decentralized as more people can run a full node. 
 If block size gets too large, it becomes harder for the average person to run a node and participate in consensus. Other cryptocurrency’s (that I prefer to not name again) want to centralize power into miners. 
Support Segwit and let everyone participate in this transformative technology.

All fakestoshi has to do is move 0.002 Bitcoin from “his” wallet and everyone would be forced to admit he is satoshi and he’d win this war against Ver but he’s not satoshi, just a scam artist that won’t be around much longer.

It demonstrated the extreme exposure the Bitcoin market is subjected to if a con man from Australia (can pretend to be its creator) can threaten to flood the bitcoin market with 1 million bitcoins and drop the price while he shorts it and makes huge amounts of money. 
Until this guy is fully 100% exposed to the average non-technical investor/user, the bitcoin market cannot grow and will continue to fall. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 03:08:25
confusion for investors who want out now. When the market drops, the riskiest assets go first and bitcoin has demonstrated the ability to be extremely manipulated by 4 people. No etf or grassroots’ trust. 
We are banked. No major wars “yet”. A technology has to serve a need and if investors rush the protocol, just more warrantless surveillance. It has to be built strong before being built upon. 
Devs won’t be rushed. Speculators gave/lost enough to allow work at leisure. 1.3 decades more unless a war happens.

HODL on bro!!  Haha.   I’ll never understand that!

And these speculators brag about it. Why don’t they read a book from Andreas or learn code and build so they don’t have to scream “HODL On” which is becoming a joke. 
There no ETF coming. No mass adoption. 10 years in and I’ve never been more depressed. Our only users are speculators. I feel sick. 
At least the price will drop to level that allows the real users/devs to build. 
These last 10 years have brought out some interesting groups who came and went. HODLers/speculators are the least important. This generation isn’t enlightened enough. Hopefully their kids are and trust they will be. More young devs is required. 
@_date: 2018-11-29 03:53:28
Andreas Antonopolous is best public speaker we have ever seen, in person multiple times, But he will avoid conflict with devs of other technology to the extreme even when they come at him. He takes payment in other coins which I personally was amazed at. 
We had to the chance to talk to Him after a talk, and discuss why he stays silent and he said he’s a Pacifist. We respect that!! 
But he is the best advocate for bitcoin, for decentralized bitcoin 1mb blocks. 
The other spokespersons are screaming louder and getting attention and we are worried they’ll come out ahead after the dust settles in 10 years and we just get another internet with government surveillance. It’s already happened with “chainalysis” which exposes every user more than ever now which is not useful in fully banked country. 
I heard Greg Maxwell’s speeches in 2013-14 where he said Privacy was the most important over scale and we all agreed. Other technology has surpassed us with privacy. The darknet, where bitcoin was actually used for something rather speculators/HODLers, at least stopped using bitcoin cause it so easily traced. He may have avoided adding CT and Schnorr that have been discussed for 2 years but not implemented due to government pressure but we’ll never know. We just see other technology being used while bitcoin is still under 50% Segwit adoption which was the cause of the 8/1/17 hardfork. With out Segwit, Lightning can’t work. 
I have personally given these best devs the benefit of the doubt and know they must be under pressure from all directions that I’m patient to the point I don’t expect to use the full potential but my kids will cause the no matter how slow and pressure these devs are under, the technology is out there and the future devs will speed up the technology and / or the pressure that holds back certain features will be lifted in a friendlier Government. States in the USA are already starting to accept bitcoin for taxes. Maybe all it takes is 1 or 2 states in the richest country to allow all these features be brought out and used. I hope. Canada is on board but USA runs it all. 
Implement Segwit 100%, Schnorr etc.... just have “public relations” for lack of better word, explaining what’s ahead and why delays and who is who, and stop making the users confused. They know you are the smartest and best devs in the entire crypto industry, they deserve some respect that they want to use your technology and trust you. Devs in bitcoin could destroy every shitcoin if they just spoke (however uncomfortable they are) to the users of their technology. It’d be great. Greg isn’t a public speaker (we know painfully well) but he could communicate via others methods he likes rather disregard his users who respect him immensely.

The debt bubble will last at least another year before the Federal Reserve purposely burst it. They need to get their family and friends taken care of before they raise interest rates again causing another recession. They didn’t expect the market to drop so fast just cause it’s anticipated in December they were going burst the bubble by raising rates. Remember the Federal Reserve is PRIVATELY owned and they control the monetary policy of the richest country and cannot be audited even when Congress asked it to be. 
When you think about Fed policy, think what would an individual with a family do to ensure their financial success for generations. They are a close knit international family.

Does bitcoin want to replace gold? Let us know please cause we thought it was the internet of money which is meant to used not HODLed. What direction is this technology going? Does it want to be the gold of crypto technology? The gold of the world? 
10 years in and still confused. Help us out. What do you want it to be? Store of value or private cash? 
In the internet age, people need liquidity/cash more than ever since the internet is flawed and watched by governments and hackers constantly. 
The base layer is more sound when Segwit is implemented keeping fees low and allowing for off chain transactions but when is that gonna happen? CT, Schnorr, Lightning. Why are we in the same place as last year? When will the devs besides Andreas Antonopolous tell us what’s going on and when?

They don’t understand how to relate to the layman at all. It’s a major disadvantage bitcoin has. It’s developers are not too good at public speaking which is needed to communicate what is important to implement. Take Segwit. They developed it and have it sitting on the shelf (under 45%). They must not care if their hard work is put to use. It’s frustrating. The other coins are shit but they have spokesman to support it.

What would stop a miner from changing his asic equipment to mine specific wallets such as satoshi’s? The reward would be a lot bigger than 12.5 bitcoin.

This community has to expose Craig Wright to the layman. Enough of his bullshit and fake threats that he’s selling his million btc. 
Until that is accomplished, they can short the market, mine at a lose and make a killing. The SEC will not allow retirement accounts be subjected to this manipulation which they can’t arrest.

You see that Ohio will allow tax payment in bitcoin. It’s like paying taxes with gold. 
The USA forced all citizens to sell gold they owned to its Treasury under the Gold Reserve Act of January 30, 1934.
Since they can’t force the selling of bitcoin (due to the way people store it with private keys), they will try to take via tax payments. They fear the freedom it offers. They want to control the spending habits of their citizens, to know where all money goes and they aren’t ready for this next generation’s freedom.

You come from a rich country. Help us understand why use bitcoin. Andreas Antonopolous says it’s mostly for remittences and high inflation countries. 
Convince us otherwise why a fully banked nation needs a new, confusing, hard to store, property?
As the price comes back to were it should be (by that I means among geek as Andreas says) only a small number of extremely smart people can use it or even want to. Am I wrong? 
When or if the price goes under 1k in any currency, the only people hurt are speculators and people who held the property without any intention of using it? 
People see the truth. Hodl just means Speculators who don’t build. Andreas Antonopolous didn’t Hodl. We had to give him Money last year so our investment would have a spokesman but people smartened up and asked WHY???’  We had no answer! 
@_date: 2018-11-04 02:25:06
The Btrash hardfork is going to drain funds from the real bitcoin (Ashame I have to say real cause Ver is such a good liar and manipulator), so we think bitcoin will drop in price for two weeks so they can get their airdrops. 
Segwit and Lightning need to Dominate. Ver and fake satoshi Craig Wright are too good at getting at new investors. First time I’m worried. Segwit is dropping to below 45%. 
People naturally want kings, queens and presidents and Btrash is centralizing itself according to human nature. Bitcoin needs to step up and stop being the leader in name only. The community is stronger than this. Come on!! Segwit has to get higher. It’s the one thing that separates bitcoin from Btrash. Any wallet or exchange that doesn’t use, tell us!!!
@_date: 2018-11-16 20:48:48
Ashame we have to give a shit about Btrash now cause they are so vocal and scare off billions of investors and an ETF. 
ETF won’t happen for years now cause of Ver and fakestoshi.

The are mining for who? They seen a group of people with an idea and provided a service. They will move on to other ideas as they pop up. 
 Adoption is years off. Years. 
These thanksgiving dinners will be brought up in a decade. 
The devs won’t be rushed. I won’t live to see it. I accepted that but I taught my nephews how to access any coins if they need a decentralized currency. They are fully banked so they don’t need decentralization yet and the bitcoin devs eventually scale bitcoin with privacy which will take years. 
Speculators need to leave this technology alone. It’s potential is too great and the more money speculators put in, the longer it will take. 
For example, No one working on Lightning would Risk a bitcoin at the inflated price. Soon they will be a leader from testing on main net.  
Speculators are the opposite of builders! Builders make the technology better. Speculators drive it to the ground. They need to back off on this protocol cause it won’t be rushed like the Internet protocol which now allows the Governments mass surveillance. Bitcoin protocol will be built correctly before businesses build off it. Sorry you speculators rushed in. Tell your kids about us. Bye

Faketoshi loves quoting Canadian and USA law to scare investors, which he knows nothing of. Anyone can get a degree in any field. He’d never pass the bar in the USA or the 1906 Supreme Court case he keeps quoting would show it was overturned decades later. Degrees don’t matter. Knowledge matters. 
Trust .... that he’s being investigated with a lot of taxpayer money. The thing with taxpayer money used for investigative purposes; the public demands a return on that investment. 
Craig S Wright overstepped hard this week and put himself out there for his own vanity which helped investigators a lot. He should have followed Ver’s example in this case. Australia will extradite with certain incentives they just heard.

You’re not alone. Everyone is asking why, when, how? It’s 10 years old. That’s beyond early adopter stage. I pin my Hope on Segwit and Lightning but I get discouraged seeing it’s not being fully implemented and when people go to use bitcoin like last year among high traffic, fees climbed to $30. I think they are setting bitcoin up as store of value but when you don’t have value to store among the younger generation, I struggle to find the point. I’m sticking with it though hoping one day soon, they get these promising scaling solutions up and running while staying decentralized. 
@_date: 2018-11-14 02:38:16

Thank you for your reply. It put things in perspective.  I believe in a decentralized currency. I see many of my peers who are also new to this technology, taking the easy route to a centralized coin due to fees. They don’t share my idealism. They just want to transfer fast and cheap. I tell them the dangers of centralized coin but they say life’s too short. 
I’ll always support the direction bitcoin is pursuing but it is frustrating for a generation raised on instant gratification and that won’t change but will only get worse with each generation.

More core developers need to speak up more and tell the community about the importance of Segwit and the progress of Lightning. They need to tell everyone what they are working on and why it’s important. Bitcoin stayed at 1mb block. They are in the know and need to speak. 
Other cryptocurrencies have people explaining everything and why certain tech has to be implemented sooner rather than later. Why can’t these core developers be more outspoken?! They have to be frustrated that Segwit is under 45% after a year.
Public speaking may not be their area of expertise but they if they want the technical advancements they developed to be used, Tell people how important it is or it’s going to sit on the shelf for 2 more years. How frustrating must it be for them to work on projects and have them not be used. 
@_date: 2018-11-29 05:07:28
Or simplify your life and use it like it’s supposed to be. Only if you understand the technology. Andreas Antonopolous isn’t a Speculator/HODLer. He saw a great works changing the technology and used his speaking about along with his technological expertise and advanced bitcoin more than anyone in our opinion. 
Don’t hold a technology like this. If you really believe in it, use it for Commerce as intended and help adoption.

Love watching Bcash destroy itself from the inside. So satisfying. CSW is doing this for 128 MB blocks. Hahahahahaha. Than he threatened everyone that he has 1 million BTC so they better listen to him. 
It’s the funniest thing to watch. Meanwhile Ver is going into hiding cause his scam is being revealed and he’s going to be questioned. He was smart to pick Japan and get rid of his USA citizenship.  He only goes on “cruises” in international waters where he’s on drugs half the time. Maybe the drugs caught up to him and he wants csw to take over. He doesn’t think he’s satoshi any more. Only Gavin thinks that who is simple focused on coding. 
They just want to sell more mining equipment. Centralize power. 
@_date: 2018-11-16 21:36:06
The  issue when investigators use public funds to investigate an issue or “someone”, taxpayers demand a return on investment (results from the investigation).
CSW showed his ability to manipulate a $100 billion market without any proof he is who he claims to be. He exposed himself and took heat off Ver. 
He can quote degrees till he’s blue in the face but the more he talks the better. Ignorance of the law isn’t a pass. He’ll be easier to prosecute. Canadian authorities have been on him for years. He finally messed up. He can’t travel to North America cause he knows what would happen right off the plane cause his old boss when he worked in the casino business was pulled off the plane and that shook him. His vanity will continue to help the taxpayer’s “return on investment.”
Australia will extradite easier than japan does. 
@_date: 2018-11-27 03:06:52
10 years in.... no adoption cause people are bragging they HODL and don’t use the technology for its intended purpose but that may change finally with Lightning. 
It’s not about the name, it’s about the features. Which crypto can offer fast, cheap transactions while staying decentralized from any nation state. The HODLers have done more harm than they know. See Andreas Antonopolous on that issue. We gave him btc last year cause he used the technology as intended and speculators needed him to keep talking.

Bitcoin is going on 10 years old. Tyler Cowen is right that now is the time that Bitcoin has to demonstrate its value. Last year’s fee crisis can’t be repeated. Segwit than Lightning need to be up to task. 
The next generation we are all counting on for adoption is ready to give it another chance. Don’t let them turn to the easy route of centralized Bcash. Everyone, up your game. Don’t support wallets that do not have Segwit. Advance Lightning. Now is the time. 
Bitcoin won’t get many more opportunities to demonstrate itself if we keep letting them not adopt the innovation that is already readily available.

Agreed, the developers will have to understand they need to offer a better product at a faster pace. Some people have families with children and future grandchildren. Developers can take their time but life is too short to invest in the potential they claim is available and than slow it down. Humans can do anything and expedite technology when we want too. 
If they want bitcoin to be the standard they need to pull a “we choose to the go moon” motivation. Traveling to the moon was faster than this technology being adopted. 
I give them the benefit of the doubt but I will lose faith soon if they continue at snails pace. 10 years is a long time in a human life and I want to know the world my grandchildren will live in. We’ve given so much patience to start the revolution but it’s just turning into a speculative market. So disappointed.

If Segwit was 90% or higher, I’d have hope progress is being made to scale but it’s under 47% after 1.5 years.

@_date: 2018-11-30 22:12:56
Agree with everything you said but if the technology isn’t used such as Segwit which is still under 50% after 2 years, than when can it be fully tested, tried, and relied on? People are trading baseball cards it feels like. Currency is harder to relate to than all technology. As Andreas Antonopolous said, bitcoin is only the 5th innovation with currency after credit cards 50 years ago. 
If I was a developer in this field, I would be so frustrated that people would rather sit on something I worked years on and not be used for the purpose it was designed. You say the technology is “early”.  10 years is a long time but That’s true when taken as a currency but there is already plenty of stores of value! We need this to be used and adopted so the future generations will have superior store if value if that’s how they want to use it cause these forks are causing significant inflation when no one knows when it’ll be stabilized. 
Early adopters; take Satoshi Nakamoto for example, have significantly less risk cause they get 1:1 ratio on all forks so they have the luxury to sit back and see how the world changes. These buying windows will eventually force speculators/HODLers to realize the fact they don’t need a store of value if they can buy back at the same price in a year or two. Adoption is the key.

Time. Time, Time. It’s frustrating when the devs know what needs to happen for success before the next generation which we need to sustain this technology, loses interest; and the devs can’t get out their project cause consensus and older holders refuse to help the the technology cause they bought in at $10. 
Devs control and patch this technology. Without the devs, there is no bitcoin. It’s centralized to the smart people who can code and not speculators gambling they don’t get frustrated and keep working. HODLers/speculators hold the potential back. 10 years in. Bitcoin is Looking like what they said 5 years ago. And new talent isn’t entering the development phase cause they don’t want to wait years, if ever, to see their hard work not be used. 
Same debate they had at universities in debate class: Is democracy the best form of government if it slows human progress? 
It’s always ended that during a war, humans look to a Lincoln who took away rights to win the civil war or FDR who took away right to fight Japan to the pint he locked up all Japanese citizens who were innocent victims of his racism. 
No one has an answer to these debates but if we believe in bitcoin as the future than it needs the next generation who so far are not interested. We can’t get them. They all say it was the fade of 2017. 
We believe that coders (who are all centralized anyway) make these decisions implement the technology to scale with privacy no matter what the USA economy says. They will hop on board as always once it is true internet cash. 
Let the future generations deal with 2120 issue of no block rewards. We need to get this upcoming generation involved cause the past 10 years has stalemated so much intellectual coders. Lightning needs to demonstrate its usefulness. Alt coins will die out. It’s 5 years or never everyone. That’s 15 years. We need to keep attracting talent if we are going to create a currency free from central banks. Millennials (81-95) are out the market is showing when we try to hire them. The second generation 95-2011 will be the ones who take the reigns if we stop this stagnation. Current devs, ball is your court for now.

I hate price talk but it brings people to the potential of the technology and They just did one of the most comprehensive simulations adding tens of thousands of factors. None go to zero. There maybe an issue in 2140 but not this generation. That’s a problem for future generations to solve like we solved prior problems from past generations. Result:
The floor is not in. It has to drop to a point where long term HODLers start selling to ensure profit. Once it becomes affordable to small businesses in the USA along with privacy features via Lightning, adoption increases and price moons till 2095 when transaction fees increase to keep miners in business. 
Most important factor in the simulation was HODLers selling at lower prices sub $1k.

Why would you spend an asset that you want to appreciate in value? Everything you bought with it would more expensive if your goals came true. Store of value is worth trillions. Nothing wrong with being a store of value. That maybe better than being a payment system. Gold is $7-$8 trillion. If bitcoin could get half that, we’re good. 
$5 trillion divided by 16 million coins (due to approximately 5 million lost forever) is not a bad goal per coin.

The only benefit speculators offer is that they will invest this to Max before putting their money back into it. They can’t build, they can’t do anything beneficial to the actual technology but they will get to the bottom of it and if there is a backdoor, they will flee and go speculate on some other thing they know no nothing about. Good, let them leave. I agree with the devs and if they want to go slow, we are young. Just hope it’s ready for my grandchildren.

Otherwise it’ll fade away for a decade which maybe a good thing while the devs build cause it can’t be sustained in its current state. 20 years to develop a technology, yet we still trust and give them the benefit of the doubt.

Anyone else starting to notice that Stablecoins are being used a lot more due to Bitcoin’s volatility?
That feature of transfer of labor/currency is one of the biggest reasons most used bitcoin in its early days. Without this feature, why would merchants accept bitcoin over a Stablecoin since it is pegged to what they want anyway. 
Bitcoin’s main selling point now looks like it capped 21 million coins, deflationary properties. And most of these coins are owned by small minority even worse than the 1% of US dollars. 
Help me out this downward negative thinking and tell me besides censorship and capped coins, why bitcoin over Stablecoins?

We are long term speculators. If price goes near the earned price than why would we or anyone hold longer when the price didn’t go up. It’s the same situation as gold. When gold drops below the bought or earned price for their labor, they sell to ensure profit.  Why hold a depreciating asset? Buying or earning earlier than someone else just sets your ability to “hope” longer. Time comes for us all my friend. It’s undefeated and unforgiving!

Why 2019. It’s been working as a currency for years until last years’ speculators over-ran the network. We use it daily as a POS. It was cheaper than Visa until last year but now it’s back and if Segwit and Lightning are implemented like the developers are working on, it’ll be the best POS in the world. 
And I refuse to run a btrash node. It’s all spam transactions and too large.

So you’re a speculator. What would happen to these 2 examples if they were never used but just bought and sat on, 1: hardware example (IPhone), 2: software (Windows or IOS). Btw, it’s hard to find anything comparable to a purposely scarce technology but than again, if it was used, it would not be forked so often to fit so many needs which inflates the supply when miners are willing to mine a coin being used. 
Speculators which what a HODLer is, would destroy the technology. A technology not used gets pushed aside for technology that makes life easier. The user doesn’t care about how decentralized or controlled such as long as they get cheapest fees fastest. 
Users are not idealogs. They go where the trust and cheapest service is no matter how centralized. 
Look at google. Every search is saved to that IP so advertisers can pay google and use target marketing. 
I want Segwit, Schnorr, Lightning, CT but if we have to wait another decade of talking about it and not using it, than where does the technology go?
My question is, should this be used as a store of value since HODLers are the main users? HODLing allows extreme volatility since each HODLer has different exit prices cause they aren’t using it. That opens to door to buying windows each year or every few years so there’s no rush to get in now when someone can buy at the same price in a year IF the technology is adopted.

We don’t think the price is burst fully yet to allow the devs to build. 
Please respect the goal of technology and stop speculating. I know USA just cares about their mighty $ but their is something bigger here that you won’t experience in your lifetime due to scaling money. 
Your children will benefit as well as the unbanked in Africa and 3rd world countries. 
To paraphrase Andreas Antonopolous, the technology is too complicated like the 1989 internet; his mom only last year sent her first email. That 25+ years. 
The value won’t be in ownership or people just skip over it. It’ll be valued when mass adoption happens and price doesn’t matter.  The protocol works no matter the price you’s Judge. If you’d think $500, they will send bitcoin at $500. 
You don’t understand the technology if you think it’s about money. It’s what you build off the protocol individually that will make you money if that’s what you care about in America. Only America... So indoctrinated about money.

What? Change from a democracy? The FED feeds these politicians who just want to survive their terms and are willing to spend whatever on the backs of their kids. Than their kids do the same. The FED knows this behavior and mastered manipulating politicians for the benefit of the few banks. Than when the banks make a mistake and mess up this formula, the government bails them out. It’s a perfectly messed up system that can’t last much longer. FED turned 100 a few years ago. They won’t turn 200 while exploiting this current democracy cause they will kill democracy. The FED/Central Banks were designed for kings and queens who ruled Europe knowing their kids and grandchildren will one day have the thrown. 4 year terms and the power the potus has is a perfect storm of destruction.

I agree Bitcoin has the Best developers but where’s the passion for their work? How can they be quiet when their development of Segwit (under 45%) is not being used. That was a main reason bitcoin stayed at 1mb cause Segwit would be backwards compatible and increase the block weight. 
Without Segwit, no Lightning. Without Lightning, no scale. Without scale, huge fees and just a name. 
If I developed Segwit, I’d be screaming it everywhere on all media. I don’t see any organization or plan and it’s mind numbing!!!!

Segwit is going back up. Always remember why bitcoin stayed at 1mb block: So everyone can run a node and Bitcoin can stay decentralized. 
They are just trying to sell mining equipment which is why they keep increasing block sizes in other cryptocurrency that I won’t mention. The bigger the blocks and more power the miners have, the more it turns into fiat money; and NOT the decentralized, censorship resistant currency the world needs. Support Segwit. It’s been well over a year. Get your game together.

Everything you said is centralized. Bitcoin is closest to decentralization in hundreds of years. I wish I could tell you what I hear every day. The government owns you all through centralized banking. It’s sickening what I hear. 
We need segwit, we need Lightning, these technologies cannot sit on a shelve and not be used. The more people use this decentralized bitcoin, the freer we become and can spread that freedom. 40% segwit adoption and Lightning not having devs doesn’t scare the government. 
If bitcoin got its act together, you have no idea the fear it would send them and we only have 2 years cause this administration likes bitcoin and didn’t expect to be here. The sec chair is on board. We continue to fail the technology. Mick mulvany controls the USA budget and why isn’t bitcoin using segwit or Lightning so far behind.

That was prior to 8/1/17 but the fork happened and they opted to go with bigger blocks. We stayed for Segwit. It’s going to happen eventually (100% Segwit), why wait and destroy. 
If any user doesn’t like cheaper fees with small block size, they have plenty of other choices. Btrash will take them. It’s not hard to opt out. Just go to a coin like Bcash that doesn’t have Segwit. Why allow an opt-in? It’s irrational!!

This is a “build” time the last 1.5 years. No reason they should delay the inevitable and they holding the full Potential of Bitcoin back.
Dorsey at least is going to make up for all the time lost by these incompetent exchanges. He’ll expedite Lightning that has been stalled by the greed.

A lot of reasons. This is a “build” time and accumulation period. They should have the time now after the last 2017 bull run, to implement it. 
But in the end as they continue to delay, it’s more and more likely Cause there would be no reason to buy Alt coins if Bitcoin scales to support billions of users and no more fees they could charge the suckers who buy them.

Asia, you control the market now. USA blew it. We look to you for guidance. You are highest IQ on the planet.  
Bitcoin opened Pandora’s Box. USA had its chance to control the market. They fucked up bigly. We look to you now. Take hold. We will follow. We are done waiting on the USA to lead. My government of Canada doesn’t have the manpower and numbers. It has to be you. Wake up Asia.

500,000 more coins were confirmed lost. It’s always good to affect the supply side rather try to to judge the demand side. Read my post and it has the link to verify that 500,000 bitcoins are lost. Supply side is easy and price increases with less 
The demand side is so much harder to judge. It’s where the innovation is, the adoption, the FUD, and everything lives. 
When we get news that supply has decreased, we should celebrate more.

Millennial already do love it. I’m a millennial and our investing money goes directly to crypto. Fuck the stock market. We seen it cycle too much and don’t trust it. No reason we should have to go through a recession just to make a few people rich. Crypto and bitcoin specifically, will change the world. We are lucky to be born in time to understand this technology’s potential. 
And generations after us will use crypto cause we will show them (our children) how to use it when they are 4 years old. They won’t switch to banks when they are 18 years old.

We used to have to work and mine gold which costs a lot of money until people excepted it as a medium of exchange. It called Proof of work (POW). Bitcoin is decentralized and bringing back the PoW standard. 
Centralized banking has such a monopoly, they gave up the POW standard (Gold back dollars). 
No more. This generation has the highest IQ in history due to having a supercomputer in their hands and any question answered in a minute. No more fake recessions, or wars for the sake of elections. 
Humans are evolving exponentially and the 1% centralized banking trick is dead. Don’t invest in those stocks. Short them and you can make a killing. We made a few test shorts of bank linked stocks and bought bitcoin with the proceeds. We are going to short them massively. JP Morgan insiders said through darknet chat rooms that they are all invested in bitcoin and have to use Tor to communicate cause Jamie diamond threatened them if they supported crypto. They are pissed cause his daughter and family own crypto but he won’t let them. 
Short all banking. You can’t lose. It’s finally a dying industry. No 8-10 year old who isn’t allowed to open a bank account, is going to switch from bitcoin to banking’s inefficiency. A simple app they used their e tire life to a complicate banking system that tells them they can can’t spend money they earned freely on products they want. Makes no sense and these kids will be the smartest generation the world has ever seen. Banks are in fear and should be. The clock is ticking. A lot of people in the banking system are using Tor to communicate to short JP and buy more crypto. 
The baby boomers are dying off, the millennials are building the future and kids under 10 today are using this technology. 
It’s the way of evolution. But banks will fight bank so it’s going to have to be revolution.

Do you think Americans know that on their east coast, a group of people not elected by them, are about to print more than the market cap of bitcoin to hold up an economy ready for collapse per the rules of the game since 1914 when the new world’s central bank was created: 10 years to a recession according the rules. 
This won’t be sustained by future humans. It’s so insane. Bitcoin is the escape created in 2008 to not have to deal with these cycles.

Bitcoin is moving on with decentralization via segwit and Lightning. Stop with the forcing people bullshit. No one is being forced. We don’t believe in that. That’s why there’s 1000 shit coins. Anyone who has a problem with segwit or Lightning can go to Bcash. Bitcoin is going to have mandate the users who stayed to use segwit. Trust me.

“Imbalances in international trade were rectified automatically by the gold standard. A country with a deficit would have depleted gold reserves and would thus have to reduce its money supply. The resulting fall in demand would reduce imports and the lowering of prices would boost exports; thus the deficit would be rectified. Any country experiencing inflation would lose gold and therefore would have a decrease in the amount of money available to spend.”

Why is debt created? It’s just the interest the government is charged as soon as money is printed by a private entity: the federal reserve which is a private company and not government. They fool Americans with the word federal and they pay trillions to outsource the printing of money.

Not forever... in 2120 when block reward stops, they can have fees. Now they can get their block rewards.  The block reward is significantly higher than any fee. Let’s not worry about 100 years from now when we won’t be here...only saying that in relation to bitcoin not global warming or nuclear war. If we survive 100 years, my great great grandchildren should pay fees and hopefully they will be the ones collecting. For now, miners should focus on block rewards. One step at a time. 
If fees return to those levels as you stated you hope, there won’t be a useful currency to the average person. Why send $3 to someone if fees are $25?! (Venmo can do that). 
No one will use it and adoption drops. I can’t comprehend your mindset wanting high fees while we still have large inflation in block rewards. Fees can be dealt with further down the line. But if you want high fees, set your Trezor to the max. You’ll be first in line. 
Plus off chain (Lightning) fees will be significantly lower than any on-chain transaction. Options are coming.

If a new person comes to bitcoin, they will be paying these fees. We don’t have too cause we been in the market for years and understand how to avoid them but when fees hit $50 last December, people sold cause it wasn’t usable.

It’s harder to do a recession on fixed supply. Recession starts with demand and supply both dropping.

Need to classify this argument I’m having with my team:
To simplify it; if there are 100 miners of Bitcoin. Blocks are validated every 10 minutes. IF 25 miners turn off their machines due to government pressure in this example, the “difficulty adjustment” written into Bitcoin’s program, will take effect and it’ll be easier to mine Bitcoin to keep the 10 minute block validation intact correct?
So no matter if there are millions or hundreds of miners, the difficulty adjustment will ensure the 10 validation, correct? 
That’s why it’s so hard to mine Bitcoin now cause there are so many miners and that 10 minutes has remained constant? Impressive

Different view of recession. The $ always exists during a recession at the same value.  Than everyone runs to a fixed supply such as gold (before bitcoin) to protect wealth. 
It’s the goods such as the housing market etc... that deflate. If people knew how many dollars would be printed (inflation rate of the $), it would mitigate recession and allow people to plan. The Federal Reserve wants a recession every 10 years. There’s no need for that anymore when we can pick a medium of exchange that established its inflation rate forever. 
Inflation is a tax on people who save ( retirement for example). Every year at 3% inflation, that lonely saved is worth less and less. Inflation benefits the debtors which is always the Federal Government so they can get elected without raising taxes.

Lightning network better keep fees low and segwit better increase adoption soon cause bitcoin will get 1 chance with these investors. Enough ideology. Mandate Segwit. Fees can’t go crazy again. It’s been coming up on a year. Everyone knows what to expect. Keep fees low or ETF is pointless.

Eventually all that will change. Cash is being phased out. Government wants to know where every dollar they magically create, goes. Bitcoin is created through Proof of Work and decentralized. 
When the government wants to control where you can and can’t spend their magic money, you’ll realize how important decentralization is. Give it 4-6 years.

I know how to send cheap transactions. New people entering the market which is needed desperately, will not know how and will use an exchange wallet. 
These are the current average fees people are paying. People like me and you are pulling that average down. These new people have no idea and will be paying higher fees like what happened in December. How don’t you see that?!
They aren’t going to buy a hardware wallet first, than try bitcoin again. They are gonna buy it, test it by transferring $5 to their son for example and see a $30-$50 fee again like last year. That was ridiculous. You can not justify fees like that.

We used to have to work and mine gold which costs a lot of money until people excepted it as a medium of exchange. It called Proof of work (POW). Bitcoin is decentralized and bringing back the PoW standard. 
Centralized banking has such a monopoly, they gave up the POW standard (Gold back dollars). 
No more. This generation has the highest IQ in history due to having a supercomputer in their hands and any question answered in a minute. No more fake recessions, or wars for the sake of elections. 
Humans are evolving exponentially and the 1% centralized banking trick is dead. Don’t invest in those stocks. Short them and you can make a killing. We made a few test shorts of bank linked stocks and bought bitcoin with the proceeds. We are going to short them massively. JP Morgan insiders said through darknet chat rooms that they are all invested in bitcoin and have to use Tor to communicate cause Jamie diamond threatened them if they came out and supported crypto. They are pissed cause his daughter and family own crypto but he won’t let them. 
Short all banking. You can’t lose. It’s finally a dying industry. No 8-10 year old who isn’t allowed to open a bank account, is going to switch from bitcoin to banking’s inefficiency. A simple app they used their entire life to a complicated banking system that tells them they can or can’t spend money they earned freely on products they want. Makes no sense and these kids will be the smartest generation the world has ever seen. Banks are in fear and should be. The clock is ticking. A lot of people in the banking system are using Tor to communicate to short JP and buy more crypto. 
The baby boomers are dying off, the millennials are building the future and kids under 10 today are using this technology. 
It’s the way of evolution. But banks will fight bank so it’s going to have to be revolution.

What u think... Fwd: 
I always look at fees. When they start going up for whatever reason, the price was going up right before it.  Than it hits a point where fee gets too high and people sell. Miners what to exploit whoever they can. They are pissed we didn’t increase the block size and they want the real bitcoin to die and Bcash to take over. 
Segwit is only 40% and Lightning’s years away. This isn’t the year AGAIN!!!  Listen, Wait for the price to go back to ATH and the fees explode. When fees go up, people sell. It’s a top indicator. It got be 3x’s as many Bitcoins by selling at $18 and buying more at $5900. It’s gonna take years for segwit and Lightning. I don’t understand what is holding it up maybe they are doing the same lol. 
These cycles will make people like us rich but adoption so slow that they may switch to another alt which Andreas said will happen in his last talk. He said bitcoin won’t be  so we just watch the price and fees and know exactly when to sell.  They are starting to think segwit and Lightning won’t be 100% for another 4-7 years. I’m older than the devs. No time to wait for that so I’ll play the game with them. 
@_date: 2019-09-20 23:33:00

You’ll get a stronger voice on how the world acts. Instead of a few making decisions, the majority will dictate what gets funded and it won’t be wars to benefit them.

Centralized banking is done. It’s done enough damage. Future generations won’t stand for it after having an alternative in bitcoin. Which is designed to be decentralized. Bcash will be centralized by the miners who like bigger blocks so they have more control.

How Bcash is in the top 10 crypto is so worrisome cause these people don’t do research. If a hedge manager was looking to invest (or when they do eventually invest), they will see within an hour that Bcash serves no purpose except centralization of miners who are rewarding themselves. 32 MB block size hahahahahaha!!! Bitcoin will do more transactions and stay decentralized with 1 mb blocks and miners will fight to get the remaining bitcoin at the next halvening. Can’t wait. Bcash will finally die and Armstrong and Ver and wright will be out of the market hopefully (if Facebook buys coinbase hopefully).

WTF America??!! This can’t be happening in this day and age of social media. Is the average American this ignorant?  
Look what your central bank is doing right now with the overnight lending rate!! Your FED is printing money to manipulate the overnight interest rate. Half a Trillion dollars in less than a week and no American cares? 
Damn, they got those middle class Americans right where they want them. They’ll wake up tomorrow and go to their jobs not knowing their dollars were inflated by an unelected group of people.

Midnight in the USA and traffic is dead. Everyone is out partying on a Friday night. The USA controls the market and is looked to for leadership. It’s not a bad thing and that’s all I meant when I said there is room for another country looking for a niche, to jump on board and support the “people ‘s money” 100%. 
China took the extreme route and out right banned it which will cost them dearly as all miners are moving out of China. USA is keeping it grassroots and not allowing institutional investing. 
Canada should embrace it with its green energy and cold climate to cool the machines. 
We were working on an internship  in DC to right the wrongs from the fraud and deceptive practice of Bch that American voters want justice for. You all know what happened it’s not a secret. My minimal part of reading the complaints from elder voters to the people in charge, part is done so know I gotta convince my government to embrace bitcoin which won’t be hard. Justin Trudeau is very interested in technology and quantum computing. He’s upset with trump at the moment so he will welcome the “people’s money” aka bitcoin to set up shop with more information. 
Everyone, good times are ahead. The fraud and confusion has to stop though. I’m glad USA’s ETF applications  focus on Bitcoin alone and not that shit hardfork btrash. I’m sorry but reading how people got scammed and so desperate to write their representatives so it doesn’t happen to other people has hardened us and everyone on the team. People were straight conned by that guy. I hope USA representatives see that and bring him to justice through the state department. Hardest most emotional  job of my life.

I’m Canadian but we want the devs. I’m working on tax free for them. Personal Estimate of just the devs is $134,900 per coin.  The devs alone give it that value. With the technology, it’s as you would you expect, Higher. 
Bitcoin is a hidden gem. You all have 1 year to accumulate.

All currency is relative to another currency or thing. 
 Let them inflate or deflate their relative currency, 
Bitcoin is set. Any currency can use it as its relative nature just like the $ and gold. 
Governments fear Bitcoin cause it’ll keep them fiscally responsible. No more fractional Reserve (lending money they don’t have)

They profit from human nature. They are global. They have self interest and not human interest. If a war, or even an act of god happens like a volcano, they get to they get to print money which goes to the 12 central banks first before being distributed. They keep an unknown % for doing nothing. 
The federal reserve is a private entity that the USA government has no control over. The Congress ordered an audit of the federal reserve and they said no. Congress doesn’t have power to order them to do anything. The president picks its head but it’s been already picked years prior. 
Biggest scam last century that will be hard to defeat. They marketed it with the word “Federal Reserve” but it’s not federal. That alone fooled Congress and Presidents for 100 years. People are waking up.

We are in the internet age now. Bitcoin is the money of the internet. The Internet is connecting people and commerce in unexpected ways. After the multiple recessions the fed artificially creates, Wall Street went overboard in 2008. 
Internet = Human connections, commerce, etc..... which needs a medium of exchange that is trusted. The first superpower to embrace it, will control the global economy for generations. China is a follower state.

We did.... it all depends on the highest fee what is allowable for the lowest fee which won’t get processed till all the high fees do. 
Segwit was 20% in November and December 2017. You really think an extra 20% of segwit with no Lightning will be enough to hold back the demand the network felt last year to the point the miners increased fees to $50.
@_date: 2018-07-29 20:56:00
If we say Satoshi has past away and with him, the keys to 1 million, that number maybe significantly lower. Think about it, those first million coins haven’t been touched in 10 years. He’s dead or can’t access them. 
Bitcoin supply is usually set in all models (21 million by 2140) regarding price increase/decrease. Most models just focus on demand since supply is set. But the supply side may need to be adjusted to account for 25-35% lost or more correctly, inaccessible Bitcoins gone forever. 
@_date: 2018-07-18 03:16:40
I always look at fees. When they start going up for whatever reason, the price was going up right before it.  Than it hits a point where fee gets too high and people sell. Miners what to exploit whoever they can. They are pissed we didn’t increase the block size and they want the real bitcoin to die and Bcash to take over. 
Segwit is only 40% and Lightning’s years away. This isn’t the year AGAIN!!!  Listen, Wait for the price to go back to ATH and the fees explode. When fees go up, people sell. It’s a top indicator. It got be 3x’s as many Bitcoins by selling at $18 and buying more at $5900. It’s gonna take years for segwit and Lightning. I don’t understand what is holding it up maybe they are doing the same lol. 
These cycles will make people like us rich but adoption so slow that they may switch to another alt which Andreas said will happen in his last talk. He said bitcoin won’t be  so we just watch the price and fees and know exactly when to sell.  They are starting to think segwit and Lightning won’t be 100% for another 10 years. I’m older than the devs. No time to wait for that so I’ll play the game with them. 
@_date: 2018-07-30 01:30:49
You are all missing the point.... the supply is significantly lower than what is published everyday. Every algorithm has 21 million coins by 2140. 
That is incorrect and the price is undervalued right now which is why we keep buying at any price under $25k till December when this information gets included in the projections. 
@_date: 2018-07-09 09:12:16

Alright, tax season is over. Let's start this up again. We see there a Bitcoincash now. That has to go. It confuses new users. One thing I realized is that US customers is all that matters with regard to price. Refunds are coming now and if the community cares about the future they will keep it simple and easy rather than needing a computer science degree to operate. We see lightning is coming on but without uers, whats the point to scale? These hardforks need to stop now. Mistakes were made and passions ran high but lets move on and ignore the 8/1 fork and move on with 2nd layer. We need better interfaces. Coinbase hurt the market more than anythingby allowing bitcoin cash on its services. If they keep allowing hard forks, no one will invest. There is one bitcoin. adding blocks is just centralizing miners to have more power. Coinbase would be wise to get ride of bitcoin cash and any future hard forks. Enough ideology of the free market will decide. The free market are uneducated and we are just confusing new users. Enough. Apologize, remove it, focus on adoption and ease of use and lets go. This year will be the last time the current generation gives bitcoin a second look. 2 weeks all.... enough of editors allowing FUD. Lets get this right in the next month and take back the years lost that bitcoin cash and coinbase cost us. Get to work. 
@_date: 2018-04-12 20:31:17
Gambling is short term gratification. This is long term investment; 5-10 years. Adoption needs to pick up this year or I agree with you. All these hardforks and high fees last year, turned people off. If we get them to try it out again, I hope Segwit and Lightning are up for it. It won’t get this many chances much longer.

If the creators of monero called their project “Bitcoin Untraceable”, monero’s price would be higher than Bcash. Ver wants the name without the decentralization. I talked to Andreas Antonopoulos on this and he said to not worry about it cause no one owns the name. I agree with him 100% but most people do not understand crypto and this is all confusing. We still believe it was coinbase’s decision to add Bcash that crashed the market in December. Americans had no idea, than seen 2 bitcoins which their family members who told them to buy it, during thanksgiving, was unable to describe why there was 2 Bitcoins listed on a trusted exchange. Confusion needs to cut back. It needs to be simple not more confusing. Bcash just adds blocks and gives power to miners while Bitcoinis innovating on second layer solutions to scalability. Educated people see that but not the new user which bitcoin needs if it’s going to grow. Always ask, “ how will the next generation use this technology” and you’ll be good. The market can’t take more confusion which is why we applaud coinbase for not listing BGold. That would chase out all new users from the richest market. The decision to add Bcash set it back a year or two which may be good cause the technology wasn’t ready and fees were too high.

We believe in Bitcoin’s future (if hard forks stop and adoption picks up).

It is worrisome that fees are going up no matter how insignificant. Segwit and Lightning should fix this problem by now. It’s the  indicator we look at abd if it continues going up, it can’t be a currency. As soon as we approach $10k, fees go up. It shows what would happen if it goes back to ATH.

If adoption finally picks up and segwit and Lightning are able to keep fees low, what’s stopping Bitcoin from taking over the crypto market and finally showing the world Bcash is pointless and centralized. We are going to get another view from curious investors and the next generation. We need better interfaces and ease of use. 
Bitcoin is the currency of innovation. Bcash is using the same old formula and is causing so much confusion. It set the market back years cause it turned off new users. Hopefully this time, Bitcoin succeeds in being able to be used as a currency. As soon as coinbase added Bcash, people left the market.

After 2020, when the overdue recession hits and a possible new administration with the VP of ‘08 administration is possibly elected, they will act fast. 
We need to get bitcoin and Lightning nodes dispersed throughout the world. Miners can be somewhat centralized but nodes are the main player in this environment and need to be spread across all different jurisdictions. 
If one major country tries to shut it down, 20 other can easily pop up. And they can keep running the same core version as new devs are educated (if they go extreme).

The people who supported it didn’t understand how Centralized big blocks make their money. They had no faith that developers would solve the problem of high fees and scalability. 
People all over the world can run full 1mb nodes (with Segwit if they choose). New phones are coming that run full nodes. 
People all over the world CANNOT run full nodes on big block nodes. The data and bandwidth is too high. That gives too much power to big block nodes and defeats the purpose of why crypto exists.

It’ll never be on main net. It’s second layer. By definition, it is not base layer. 
Base layer is secure, tried and tested. Second layer uses that 10 years of battle tested technology to advance payment processing, and use the base layer just for settlement. Some transactions won’t even have to go to the base layer.  
Some will use the base layer as store of value while majority will use second layer Lightning for instantaneous payments at fractions of a penny. It’s going to revolutionize everything. For example, you pay bills monthly or get paid salary weekly. 
Future generations won’t have to deal with that and will receive and pay simultaneously. 
Humans have too much potential to focus on money and bills. This allows the human species to evolve by including every human on earth and allowing them to focus on their individual specialties.

If bitcoin can be a payment protocol with easy on and off ramps that are decentralized and cheaper, people will use Bitcoin over Visa. 
What business in the internet age, wouldn’t love being able to easily convert bitcoin to local currency.
Its worth as a store of value is proven to be unnecessary due to volatility. 
Once Segwit than Lightning are fully operational, a customer can open a payment channel at a bar for example and close it at end of of the night and not pay 2-3% fees that Visa charges and Lightning will allow more privacy over Visa. 
The examples are endless. You can open payment channels for any commerce. We are at a bar now but tomorrow we will be at a coffee shop to help get rid of a (possible) hangover and we’ll have payment channel open there as well. Once speculators let devs build, it’ll come sooner rather than later.

No old people who will be passed on in a decade will waste their valuable time learning to understand it especially how complicated the UI is; but younger people are learning even with horrible UI.

Price doesn’t matter. The devs are what matters and the users. 
Don’t let price cloud the ultimate goal of a private, secure, fast transfer system. Humans are now firmly in the Internet age. We need bitcoin as the cash!! 
So many ideas / specialized labor, in this stage of human evolution that bitcoin is needed. Banks only allow  a small % of humanity to transfer their labor/ideas to others. These people once included in the internet age can offer so much. How many Einsteins or other geniuses have gone forgotten cause they were unable to transfer their labor easily? 
If you care about climate change or any issue, bitcoin can open the world to these forgotten people. They may have the answers to problems this world needs. Just cause you have a bank, shouldn’t give you the exclusive right to be able to participate in this world.

That we stayed at 1mb hoping for Segwit and Lightning Network while Segwit is dropping under 45% now and Lightning is years away still. 
That other scaling solutions are being proven. 
No fear that crypto will go away, just which one wins the next generation’s trust to commerce with each other through. They already have the phones and are literate on levels never seen before in history. They have information at their fingertips. Now it’s just where they put their trust regarding their medium of exchange. Are they willing to pay higher fees for a more decentralized bitcoin or take the easier, cheaper route through a more centralized medium.

So you were proven wrong on Segwit. I run a Lightning node also but that doesn’t prove anything. 
We need users to use it for it to be adopted by the upcoming generation. If we can win over this upcoming generation, bitcoin will succeed and the great technology made possible by the best devs such as Schnorr, Segwit, CT etc... will finally be adopted and secured for many future generations (no matter what the G20 is attempting right now). 
Think long term not short term. Short term is a battle and I don’t expect to live long enough to see full adoption but I want to leave this next generation, the best medium of exchange to trade their labor and specialties with. 
Inflatable Fiat won’t work. 
@_date: 2018-12-04 02:53:07
Can we still use it to transfer money. That’s all we care about. You’s can HODL but we are moving on with Segwit and Lightning as a means to transfer money including micropayments. 
HODLers ..... future generations will never understand why you sat on the best payment system ever and held the technology back. It goes against common sense and now is the time of reckoning with a new generation coming in and wanting the internet of money to transfer their labor/money, not sit on it.

The fully banked don’t need a store of wealth. We just need a better payment transfer system in the Internet age cause banks are failing. But banks are trying.

People all need to work but where they put the fruits of their labor is most important. Bitcoin is fixed supply. You can know it’s supply in 100 years. The central banks could decide today to inflate the currency and print a few hundred billion of their currencies.
@_date: 2018-12-05 05:12:43
Agree!!!.....We don’t use it to speculate/HODL! There are much better things to buy that will appreciate in value. We use bitcoin as a payment system. If you want an asset that appreciates, buy property and you can even write off the mortgage interest. 
Once these HODLers go back to trading baseball cards,  we can finally use Bitcoin with Segwit, Schnorr signatures, than Lightning. 
@_date: 2018-12-05 10:40:35
Micropayments will be the future. Not storing wealth!! A payment system in the internet age. 
If someone has wealth and they are young enough to understand bitcoin, god bless them. They are the very few. 
People with wealth have better ways to store it and it’s not going to be in bitcoin. Bitcoin will be the cash (for lack of better word) in the internet age. 
If you are someone who is young (under 35) and have so much money you need to store it, go buy a rare baseball card or anything else. Stop speculating and holding back the payment feature of Bitcoin so it can grow and most importantly, keep the best devs cause without these devs, bitcoin is worthless.

With miners dropping out and difficulty adjustment the other day, hope that opens the door for new miners who will implement the technology from the best devs. Schnorr, Segwit, CT and eventually the masterpiece: Lightning. 
The next generation is waiting. Let’s leave them the best payment system. 
Bitcoin with Segwit and Lightning will be the greatest payment system in human history.

Make it so it’s so easy that people (even banked people) prefer to use it to commerce with each other with, over their credit cards. Like email. Andreas Antonopoulos gives a great example how complicated email was than his mom just recently sent an email with a simple slide of the finger. 
Once bitcoin gets there while staying decentralized and cheap, that’s when moon. 
Embrace these down times to build the technology up and not to just keeping asking when, when , when.  
Don’t speculate, build. Bitcoin needs all professions not just coders. It needs better user interface, better storage methods, better marketing, accountants etc...

You are not answering the main question... 1.5 years and it’s “hovering” around 50% still. I don’t want to get into a debate if it’s going up to 45% or down to 45%. That chart/facts speak for themselves. Our goal is to increase Segwit and I can tell you want Segwit also so let’s get the word out to only support Segwit wallets and boycott the ones who refuse to allow the innovation. 
@_date: 2019-05-06 06:59:08
Majority of speculators who just use bitcoin to trade, watch fees as the price goes up to test the base layer. Shit coins know this and they spam the network To  increase fees and stop it. 
Miners want fees high as possible and want to dictate the consensus rules, so they make it hard for people to run nodes (by increasing the block size) cause nodes are the most important part of the ecosystem,nodes tell the miners what blocks to mine. Miners don’t like that which is why Segwit is under 40%. 
Lightning can only run on Segwit so I wish nodes would demand Segwit only blocks if that’s possible. Segwit is old technology at this point. No reason we are allowing miners to continue to choose not to mine Segwit blocks. Miners know without Segwit and Lightning, they get higher fees. 
There will come a point when nodes have to say, Segwit only blocks- THAN nodes will pop up all over the world and the blockchain is small enough for anyone for run a full node bitcoin node with Lightning. 
No organization of governments or corporations could dent a system that strong.

Maybe they are using it as a money transfer protocol aka cash. Not everyone has to be a speculator. 
It works great as payment system. Instant transfer on the most secure blockchain. You don’t have to believe in bitcoin to HODL it and never use it; and still use the main feature of money transfer. 
If bitcoin drops to $100, you can still transfer $25 through its blockchain. If it goes to $10,000, you can still use it to transfer the same $25. 
Sorry that not everyone wants to sit on it for years.

We just transfer money with it using Segwit only Bitcoin wallets and make sure the money got to destination fast, cheaper and more secure than bank a wire or PayPal even. 
HODLers need to go speculate on something else. The price of a payment system and eventually payment channel means nothing to the actual users.

If bitcoin can be a payment protocol with easy on and off ramps that are decentralized and cheaper, people will use Bitcoin over Visa. 
What business in the internet age, wouldn’t love being able to easily convert bitcoin to local currency.
Its worth as a store of value is proven to be unnecessary due to volatility. 
Once Segwit than Lightning are fully operational, a customer can open a payment channel at a bar for example and close it at end of of the night and not pay 2-3% fees that Visa charges and Lightning will allow more privacy over Visa.

There was never a point to HODL!!  They are finally being shed from the technology and we can proceed to build without their influence. 
I feel bad for the next market they speculate on. Speculators doom all markets they enter. 
Maybe they can get their money together and go speculate on the “Mona Lisa”! 
They will destroy the worth that too. Lol... but at least it’s just a painting and not a payment system protocol that could advance humanity.

When will this be available outside “testnet”?  In your opinion, what is holding Lightning back from being used? I understand Segwit is only 45% after 1.5 years. Is Lightning 1 year away? I know corporations and employers would love micropayments to ensure they get maximum profits. If adoption isn’t there peer to peer cause HODLers refuse to use it; than corporations will be the ones to make adoption. HODLers don’t get it that bitcoin and Lightning work at any price. We don’t care about price!; just private, fast, censorship resistant transactions. 
We read a dev blog saying “There are 7 decimal places that we can use while speculators go nuts”. Than they went too technical to follow but we are glad devs are bypassing HODLers and aren’t allowing them to hold back the technology. Bitcoin at a $1 works the same as bitcoin at $100. We will keep funding devs so they don’t get discouraged cause their technology they spent so much time on is sitting on the shelf. 
Devs are the reason we believe in this payment protocol. Without these great minds, bitcoin is useless. Please stay with bitcoin. These speculators will tire out eventually to the next big thing.

Once the technology gets free of speculation, it can be used to its full potential. The next generation of devs won’t want to work on bitcoin if the technology they develop isn’t used. 
Don’t care about price cause bitcoin works no matter if the price is $10 or a $10,000. You can still transfer $50 to your family and friends at any price. Once Lightning is allowed to be developed and used, micropayments will be possible which corporations such as Netflix for example would love. 
Treat it as the Internet of money (cash). Private, fast, censorship resistant in the Internet age. We need this payment system now not later. Speculators need to go buy antiques or a painting to speculate on. Not this payment system for the Internet age of humanity. 
@_date: 2018-12-05 10:38:10
Micropayments will be the future. Not storing wealth!! A payment system in the internet age. 
If someone has wealth and they are young enough to understand bitcoin, god bless them. They are the very few. 
People with wealth have better ways to store it and it’s not going to be in bitcoin. Bitcoin will be the cash (for lack of better word) in the internet age. 
If you are someone who is young (under 35) and have so much money you need to store it, go buy a rare baseball card or anything else. Stop speculating and holding back the payment feature of Bitcoin so it can grow and most importantly, keep the best devs cause without these devs, bitcoin is worthless. 
Use the technology they spent their time on!! Enough already!! A decade in and you’s are bragging about never using technology as intended.

No matter the price, you can use it transfer money on the most secure blockchain. 
It works at any price. 
With miners dropping out and difficulty adjustment the other day, hope that opens the door for new miners who will implement the technology from the best devs. Schnorr, Segwit, CT and eventually the masterpiece: Lightning. 
The next generation is waiting. Let’s leave them the best payment system. If the want store of value, buy what generations did thousands of years and use precious metals. 
Bitcoin with Segwit and Lightning will be the greatest payment system in human history. 
Personal labor and trading that labor with each other, is something that has never changed nor will ever change in human evolution. 
We just need a better medium of exchange for our labor. With that, human evolution will speed up faster than during the industrial revolution did.

The USA Federal Government will never approve An ETF while this remains a mystery. That’s not a bad thing. There are only 21 million bitcoins ever to exist. If someone holds 1 million bitcoins and no one knows who he/she is, they can’t approve an ETF cause that person would control a significant-portion of the supply and manipulate the price. 
Only after these million coins which Craig claims to have and no one has been able to disprove fully, will the market sleep tight. This should be a bigger issue but isn’t cause they mark them as lost and missing in price models. Every time he talks, he alters those models and the price fluctuates.

Just focus on the technology not the price. Ask yourself what can this decentralized, Private, payment system do for you? If the answer is positive, than use it. 
If you are banked and don’t care about privacy, and willing to allow everyone know what your labor is and to who your paying and receiving payments, than it can’t be beneficial and move onto something else. 
Life is too short to focus on a technology you have no interest in. It’s not a get rich scheme. 
The world needs this payment system and speculators are holding it back.
