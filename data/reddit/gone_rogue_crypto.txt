Some cryptocurrency / Bitcoin news websites do nothing more than copy and paste (give or take maybe 80% (and that's being generous)) of an article from another website and make a news article out of the content.
I personally think people talking about Trump's stance towards bitcoin on any news website, cryptocurrency-oriented or not, is perfectly fine. These are popularly known as opinion pieces.
Other websites do zero fact-checking and publish false headlines with strawman arguments for content. Like really, read between the lines for some of these news sources.

My point is that a lot of cryptocurrency and bitcoin news sites / journalists push content out expressly for the point of obtaining clicks / views without any concern for journalistic integrity or factuality of content.
As far as I can tell, this isn't a massive issue with but with it can be. Let's say I own 5 1 oz gold bars. Then lets say I go to Italy. I buy a 600 USD Gucci luxury wallet using gold, and I vlog it, and post it to youtube. Then a journalist watches my vlog and decides to make a news article titled, "Gold is now legal tender in Italy in 2019!"

Do you really think the exchange I work for would hire someone that didn't know how to obtain bitcoin?
