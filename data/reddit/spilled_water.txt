Would you like to answer?

Nothing about that screams scam. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:39:39
Wait, how come BCH is a scam but BTC isn't?

If you hate coin base, what do you use? I've been thinking about an alternative.

I don't get it. He didn't explain why he thought it'll be 5% of gold. How did he get there? Why not 10%? 20%? 1%?

With which bitcoin mining machine can you achieve that? [With something like this?]( Also how long would it take to mine one BTC?

I took a look at the source code the other day and was overwhelmed. Are there any tutorials, videos, or lectures on how the technology works at the source code level?

There's a lot of cryptocurrencies right now that are worth $13. Would you put $300 in any of them?

A lot of people are asking what the heck is going on. To be honest, 10 days ago, I was just as confused. I found a great and informative thread posted here 8 days ago.

That's an awesome response.
Where do you stand on the great debate? 
@_date: 2017-09-14 16:23:04
I sold all of my cryptos. I'm deciding to wait it out on the outside. I'll jump back in a few days later no matter what the price is, but I just wanted to get out of today's dip.

Try sending your bitcoins to a different wallet, and then cash it out of that. 
@_date: 2017-06-14 00:31:36
It's insane that you're so sure to expect BTC to be worth that much in 15 years. 
It could.. And it could be worth far far less.
