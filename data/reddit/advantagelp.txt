Here are some key points of signing a electricity contract thru an aggregation service instead of just using a broker:
1. As an aggregator we broker deals just like a broker would working with a supplier
2. Brokers offer a deal from a supplier based on your individual usage. Just like with buying anything, the more you buy, the cheaper the price. Suppliers (REP) become increasingly more aggressive in lowering the energy cost due to an abundance of competition from other suppliers. 
3. With aggregation we combine all our customers that sign up into deals with the suppliers to gain leverage as i was saying before. 
4. We can broker 3, 6, 12 months deals like any other broker but the savings would not be significant (assuming natural gas prices decrease and we have a cooler summer than expected in Texas)
 
Bitcoin miners and BTC appeal to us because we feel like we are leveling the playing field for residents and business owners in the ERCOT system that are getting pushed around by the Reps because of their lack of usage. I don't know as much as i would like about BTC and bitmining but it seems like cyrptocurriencies are appealing because wanting a change from the normal corruption and games big banks play...

We are a young and company and have grown significantly since our hard launch in January 1, 2014. We are a licensed aggregation company in Texas and are not claiming to be a retail provider. In aggregation, we combine customer usages, shop around different retail providers for what the lowest rate they can offer for a fixed term contract (12 months). As we get new customers to sign up, our usage increases along with the leverage in negotiating with the retail providers to get the price closer to the actual wholesale rate.
How is aggregation is NOT total bullshit?
We want you to sign be signed up with us in a contract thru a retail provider and will do everything we can to notify you when your contract is ending. If you are not in a contract with a retail provider and are just paying MTM, you will be paying significantly more than you should. 
Since we are a new company, we are testing different markets and would like to be exposed to as many groups as we can to advertise. It seems that most people talking about electricity on here are impressed and jealous from customers only paying 12 cents/kWh, when we are offering 12 month fixed electricity contracts for UNDER 10 cents/kWh. Saving around 20-30% on your electricity makes a big difference...especially to you guys who are using the amount of power you guys are using.
We can provide to anyone available in the deregulated Texas market and would love the chance for your business. If your interested in learning more or have general questions about the electricity market in Texas, please check us out @  or give me a call (one of the principals) at 877-262-0950

Please educate me on how lowering electricity costs for miners wouldn't benefit. Are you referring to Bitcoin only or other coins as well? I understand that some machines wouldn't benefit as much as others, but I'm a little lost how lowering electricity wouldn't help, well, anyone.
