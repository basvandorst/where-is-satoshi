do an nslookup on google.com for an example of why same domain is not "same server"
@_date: 2014-02-25 07:18:59
you're still wrong. that's just a proxy that routes to multiple servers rather than dns round robin 
@_date: 2014-02-25 04:31:41
same domain name is not "aka same server".

miners don't need the support of the nodes.  node numbers are easy to fake, and having a node on a minority chain with 100k+ backlog and 1-2 hour blocktimes for the next 2 months is basically worthless.  
@_date: 2017-03-28 10:58:28
it's not like there are going to be 0 nodes on a majority chain. 
@_date: 2017-03-27 10:56:19
I don't see how.  A minority chain in a hardfork is not usable because it's not being mined, few/no new blocks are being produced, and there is little economic incentive for miners to continue with that chain, meaning it dies.  Users can absolutely say "i don't agree that the majority chain is valid, so i'm going to continue using the minority chain", but they won't be able to realistically make transactions.  Miners on the majority chain also have the option to produce a number of empty blocks for the minority chain which they can then save and post any time a new block on the minority chain is found, invalidating it, making it effectively dead, but I don't think that's likely to happen.
@_date: 2017-03-27 13:00:47
just talking generalities here, not any political argument for or against any split proposal. why would the minority chain have more value if it can't be traded? 
@_date: 2017-03-27 10:32:15
node numbers are extremely easy to fake.  ultimately it's up to the people producing the blocks to decide.  renting some servers with large blocks of ip addresses is trivial, money wise, compared to how much money the miners have invested in hash power
@_date: 2017-03-28 08:27:38
95% never happening at this rate, so your point is rather moot, but having the majority of full nodes will not prevent a hard fork
@_date: 2017-08-01 11:43:37
running a node does not keep anyone honest if it's not mining
@_date: 2017-08-26 02:26:10
don't segwit nodes still need to store segwit data on disk? 
@_date: 2017-08-01 14:20:10
similar to independence day
@_date: 2017-08-26 05:30:39
where does the extra data get stored? 
@_date: 2012-01-10 18:55:27
Oh yeah, this will definitely add some credibility to bitcoin. /s
Also, do you really think bitcoin is easy enough to use for the average person of that profession to figure it out?  And honestly, will it make them any more money to do this?  
@_date: 2012-03-01 11:32:48
it isn't.
@_date: 2012-01-04 19:16:15
Consumer protection is the most important thing to ebay.  If consumers feel unsafe buying from ebay then their entire business will collapse.  There will always be more sellers as long as there is profit to be made, so from a business standpoint, can you really blame them? 
But that's really going off on a tangent.  Merchants getting hit with chargebacks has nothing to do with bitcoin, unless you're saying that irreversible transactions where customers can't get their money back no matter what is going to fit into e-commerce in any form, in which case, I'll be here laughing.

Other than transfer an amount from point a to point b, bitcoin does nothing that paypal does.
@_date: 2012-02-08 16:45:49
lol.  yeah good luck with that.
@_date: 2012-01-04 11:04:33
Can I put my credit card number into bitcoin and instantly transfer the cost of something to someone else with buyer protection already taken care of using bitcoin?  No?  Then it isn't a practical replacement for paypal as far as ebay or anything that needs recourse against scammers is concerned.
@_date: 2012-02-07 22:56:34
Bitcoin is nearly impossible to use, and is pretty damn traceable if you actually try to do anything with it.  Not sure why anyone smart would want to use it for something like this.
@_date: 2012-02-11 01:23:23
Nah, I'll just downvote your shit instead.
@_date: 2012-01-04 19:18:52
Yeah, you made my point much better than I did, haha.  I don't always have a way with words.
@_date: 2012-01-04 20:06:21
So if i buy something on ebay with bitcoins and it never gets sent to me, what can i do?
@_date: 2017-10-04 00:29:26
sure but that's far from the case here. very few people understand the situation let alone care either way
@_date: 2017-10-03 16:30:41
it was a rhetorical question. they don't, nor should they

doubt it considering how badly they messed up the bch fork
@_date: 2017-10-05 01:15:41
correct, and they've been doing that for many months as you can see, bitcoin market cap is below 50% now because blocks are too small to handle the volume 
@_date: 2017-10-03 09:29:55
yes, they provide the food the customers want, they don't use the brand of equipment that the customers want to produce it, though.  
@_date: 2017-10-02 04:51:33
More like you have as much of a say as a customer does over how a corporation is run.
@_date: 2011-06-24 16:29:59
the currency is still decentralized.  speculation by some redditor about bitcoin mining (not bitcoin itself) becoming more centralized is a far cry from what you're implying.
@_date: 2011-07-27 04:42:24
How is this shocking?  If you have only $600, they don't let you in.  Bitcoins are not legal tender.  Anywhere.  
I know this is the bitcoin forum and the circlejerk will probably downvote this comment to shit, but this would be the equivalent of saying you have collected 5000 coins in mario saved on your gameboy and are going to try to use that to fund your trip.  
@_date: 2011-06-25 23:37:24
I don't see how their site could possibly be more functional than it is now.  It has a form for placing buy orders, a form for placing sell orders, you can view your standing orders, view your balance, and they even have an api.  What the fuck are you even talking about?
@_date: 2011-09-28 18:52:54
there is no such thing as challenging a chargeback.  You can send in information about it in hopes of keeping your merchant account alive with too many chargebacks but its never about getting the funds back
@_date: 2011-06-22 09:09:22
I'm glad there are some intelligent folks on here.  Was getting a bit sick of the irrational LOL BITCOIN IS DEAD and retarded image macro posts featuring MtGox people.
@_date: 2011-09-28 07:11:19
Sounds like you're new to the credit card processing game.  Chargebacks never go in favor of the merchant.  You being notified is merely a formality after the fact.

If it's having you fill out a survey, they're likely getting a dollar or two per person for that, so they make a decent profit depending on how little the bitcoin payout is.

It's tough to sympathize with a business like this that can't float 30 days worth.  This is NOT google's fault.
@_date: 2011-12-18 03:34:31
So your argument for bitcoin is to get rid of fees associated with payment processors.  Getting bitcoins with any reasonable ease requires giving the same money to payment processors, just with tons of added hassle.  Not sure why it's a good idea.
@_date: 2011-06-22 04:50:09
This shit is getting retarded. They got their DB stolen. Yes, it was their fault. No they're not handling the aftermath poorly.
@_date: 2011-06-19 21:52:48
if it's unacceptable to you, use another market.
@_date: 2011-06-25 21:32:54
Their site got hacked and they've done pretty much everything properly in recovering from it.  I'm not sure how this analogy is getting any upvotes.
@_date: 2011-07-27 15:19:19
Paypal is actually established and well-known, as well as it basically being a bank. You can even get a paypal debit card, and your balance is shown in USD.  
Bitcoin is a hardly-established virtual currency with speculative value that barely anyone has even heard of.  How you could draw that comparison is mind blowing.
@_date: 2011-11-28 21:37:20

I understand the joke you're trying to make, but 13mil getting scammed from some company is not the same as having the largest monetary exchange hacked into, crashed, having all customer data stolen, etc.

Either the bitcoin price will have to go up a fuckton or these things will have to be incredibly powerful and cheap to even be relevant in 4th quarter 2011.

Uh they have what...50k users?  Having not personally replied to your email in this crisis is actually a point in their favor.  The only argument you have listed is their webdesign which is such a non-argument and has no correlation in any way to their backend coding.  
For you to call anyone 'sheeple' after that paragraph is just jokes.
