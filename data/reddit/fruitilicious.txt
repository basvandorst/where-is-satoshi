I think what a lot of people don’t consider is your age, if you’re say 23 fresh out of college with minimal debt making 55k, your risk tolerance will be much higher than someone who is 35 with 2 kids under 5 years old.
Everyone’s situation is different, if you were a 19 year old in college at a community college working in a a job that pays around $12-15 an hour you could probably afford to dump 90% of every dollar you earn into something like bitcoin.
But take the 35 year old with a mortgage and mouths to feed, they may choose to invest the majority of their money in things like stocks and bonds

Is it from a company called EnergyBuyLine? Because I’m dealing with the exact same thing for my debit card, I never even use my debit card either

The amount of times that I have seen bitcoin double in price, nothing can phase me.

My grandfather is a US resident, I thought he wouldn't be allowed to have an account at BitMex

And you know this from personal experience? You’ve easily transferred 6 figures out of Mexico into the US before?

coinbase doesn't support MEX/BTC nor does it support transfers from mexican bank accounts, I think localbitcoins is the best option

currently they have a niece of theirs living it for the past years, essentially for free, they take care of the home but, they are also concerned about her trying to keep and claim the home once my grandparents pass, hence why they are looking to try to sell it now.
Until a few years ago my grandparents would spend about 3-4 months each year living in mexico with her but with age they have stopped going pretty much completely

Coinbase doesn’t support deposits from Mexican bank accounts, nor do they deal in pesos, tbh I do wish I could get XRP as it’s just so much faster but liquidity for BTC is better and I’m trying to move a lot more than just a couple thousand dollars

the issue lies in government and bank censorship of money, specifically large quantities, banks often try to deny people trying to send large amounts of money out of mexico.
local bitcoins doesn't seem viable either as purchasing the low 6 figures would take forever and be a hassle.
