Let me guess, details in two weeks?

Remember the old days of same day cash deposits?
Good times.

And what would stop people from dropping this new coin the second times get tough?
The wealth will accumulate in the same manner with any currency.

Why didn't fintrac bother to track the 90k hush money cheque from the PMO to a senator but is so worked up about virtual currencies?
Surely money laundering in the highest levels of government should be a higher priority?

But I want to use it, and I am sure lots of other people do too. 
The market simply won't use it? I am not so sure that is right. There are still gold markets is there not? If I want to borrow money I go to a bank, I don't try to buy gold, but that doesn't make gold useless. 
I think that there are probably some other people that see the advantage of a currency that gains in value. 
When it comes down to being "free to choose" I just can't see anyone opting for saving with an inflationary currency. 
Of course, nowadays saving is a bad word. Nobody has ever heard of delayed gratification, or the story of the ant and grasshopper.

Maybe he meant millibits. 
If bitcoin goes to $10, I will own a lot of them, can't help but think others would feel the same.

Ghash.io and btcguild don't really care about this, nor do the people who choose to mine on those pools.

But if I lend it that is more risky. If you mean in a bank, that's all fine and dandy if interest was paid, but with inflationary currencies why bother with high interest rates?
By saving bitcoin I am helping the bitconomy by increasing the scarcity.
Stock certificate is a great way to think of it. It's a great stock in a great
Why must we get all worked up about semantics?  Currency, unit of account, money, stock certificate. Bitcoin is new and hard to classify.

I strongly encourage people to use brain wallets - as long as they use dice to make them and have at least 7 words

A better question might be - why would a consumer of illegal goods? What with the permanent record and all. 
But no, I buy things with bitcoins cuz they are worth so much more than they were when I bought them, so everything feels like it is free. Pain in the ass selling on an exchange just to fund account to use credit card. Too long didn't buy. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 01:29:31
Perhaps you missed my mention of dice?

Not if they upped their rewards, lowered their fees. People are really irrational when it comes to mining pools. 
@_date: 2013-12-30 13:54:39
It has been a long wait, I am looking forward to getting mine. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 11:38:01
Cheap bitcoins. I know I'm buying some today. Sale on bitcoin.

Forgive me for my sophomoric questions. 
If we are to have free markets, then that means a free exchange of currencies doesn't it?
With bitcoin being open source, couldn't Krugman just make his own altcoin that follows all of the economic necessities he cries out for?
If we are to have a free exchange of currencies, then if Krugman is right and inflationary currencies are better, wouldn't everyone move to the coin that loses value over time, rather than the one that gains value?
Because I know how much everyone cringes when they wake up to see that their bitcoin are worth more than they were the day before. (Sarcasm). 
But really though. Free markets. If we are free to choose, then who in their right mind picks the inflationary currency?
So basically anyone against deflationary currencies are against free market (they like forcing people). ?
@_date: 2013-12-18 00:36:53
It isn't a problem at all. 
You have enough currency to buy a widget.  You don't spend it and then after a month you can afford two widgets because your currency is worth more. 
Do you:
A - get angry and swear you will never use a deflationary currency again. 
B - realize that people who think deflationary currencies are bad don't know what they are talking about. 
Bitcoin will never be worth anything because people will never spend them because they will be worth too much. 
Crazy talk that doesn't understand human behavior.

Uhmmm... If anyone wants to sell me their bitcoins for $11, I'll buy every one you have. Hmmm.... How will they fall to 10 if I buy them all at $11?
@_date: 2013-12-18 11:38:51
Stop telling people what to do with their bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-12-17 11:32:38
Downvoted for trying to tell me what bitcoins were meant for. I'll do what I want with mine, you do what you want with yours. 
Also, quit whining about volatility, suck it up, buttercup.

How did you even post this without help from something made in China? Your tablet, computer or smartphone? Router?
Bic lighters I think are the only american made product anymore, and their high quality makes me long for the days when you could find a tag that didn't say 'made in China' 
I mean who has ever had a bic lighter break before running out of fuel? And who has ever had a Chinese lighter last till it ran out of fuel?
@_date: 2013-12-18 01:04:53
No I think you have that backwards

Botnets are of 0 consequence to bitcoin, thanks to asics.
