This is the best write up? The English is pretty abominable don’t you think?

Well terrain is precious because it is limited and we can build on it. So is Bitcoin. It is the bedrock of this new industry. This is the digital age. You don’t have to be able to hold it anymore.

Obviously new to this.

In response to that, if all the speculators boosting the value of bitcoin sold out right now, the value would not be zero. There are people that believe in it’s core philosophy.

Chill out Bitcoin. Have a kit kat.

Obviously you’ve already made up your mind on the value of Bitcoin and that’s fine. Just enjoy the show on the sidelines. I really recommend spending some time learning more about the ecosystem of cryptocurrencies however. It’s definitely the next generation of finance whether it’s Bitcoin or something else.

Why? You gonna give him a gut punch to rub it in?

Just forget about crypto for a week or two. Unless you’re an adept day trader. It’s Christmas time.I’ll just hodl until normal service resumes. That goes for all my cryptos. Anyone getting into crypto not expecting this type of thing now and again hasn’t done their homework.

I’ve done that before. Got the hell out of their pretty quickly though. Had to take a shower afterwards.

Not really. It’s because this is how people have gotten rich on crypto. They’re just sharing their common wisdom and they believe strongly in the value of cryptocurrency in most cases. Who cares if a bunch of Redditers sell their bitcoin? Most of the world hasn’t even heard of Reddit.

Not telling you NOT to sell your discount bitcoin but if I had some spare cash lying around I’d be buying more of it to add to what I’m holding now. This isn’t the first time bitcoin’s dropped. I’ve been through a few flash crashes and it always jumps back up. Your friend gave you good advice you just aren’t used to the markets. I think you’ll be kicking yourself in a few days or weeks if you do cash out.

We won’t. Bitcoin is evolving into a store of value similar to gold. It’s not viable as a currency due to it’s volatility and inferior tech. Other cryptos are better placed to fulfill that role. One big benefit of crypto in general is that you own the currency. Not the bank. It is as created as a reaction to the current financial system which is toxic.

I don’t know what this original post was since it was removed but if you want to make money just invest a little and be patient. You probably won’t get rich but just get what you can and be grateful you got onto crypto before most. If you get Ripple and just hold onto it you should make steady safe long-term gains. You should probably stay away from day-trading and more speculative crypto investments judging from the little I know about you from your Reddit output. Posting negative comments in subreddits will only get you angry feedback. Good luck.

If I were you I’d hold your bitcoins and sell them when the price rebounds. Then do some research and sell the bitcoins for Wabi IOTA or OmiseGo. Those are a few examples of cryptocurrencies that have a clear use. Shouldn’t you be aware of this already?

In your respective field and as an economist I’ve no doubt you are very knowledgeable. We’ll have to wait and see what happens. It’s already being called the biggest bubble of our times. My feeling is that there will be a crash but similar to the early internet it won’t go away. It’s been bubbling under the surface for a few years. You can’t stop progress.
