Ask him why he thinks it's ok to retain a 1:25 asset to liability ratio at his bank.
JP Morgan currently has 2.1 trillion in assets on their books and 51 TRILLION DOLLARS in notional derivatives liabilities hidden off balance sheet.  And those are just the non-OTC derivatives they bother to inform Treasury of.

Did you see that the support email auto repsonse said it would be 72-96 hours before they would be able to respond to your ticket?  10 days obviously is too long, did you make 1000 tickets in the initial 72-96 hours?
I had a similar xfer that went afoul, and got the same autoreply.  No response to my ticket yet.
They also seem to have a *stickied* warning that average ticket respone time is 72 hours since 1 week now:

@_date: 2018-09-04 16:25:44
If you're talking about BIP174 no, it allows for a "Partially Signed Bitcoin Transaction" format that wallets can exchange with each other to update transaction signatures as a transation becomes signed by the multiple parties needed.  Exchange of these partially signed transactions is done out-of-band so to speak - the wallet/user is responsible for figuring that out, but eventually the transaction is fully signed by all parties and looks like a transaction publishable to the blockchain.

I know.  It was a related but different question.  It is not ridiculous if you really think about it - Satoshi started one of the biggest open source projects known to man.  Although we cannot say for sure which OS he uses, we can ask, "who else runs a large open source project and what OS do they use?"
To that end, I was asking if you know of any party that fits the bill (uses Windows and is heavily involved in a popular open source project).  Apparently you cannot name anyone because you did not.  If you can find an example I would genuinely appreciate an answer as my question was not rhetorical.

Crypto shines when fiats fail.  If we enter a very monetarily unstable period like an impending crash similar to 2008, or similar other likely event may bring quite a few national currencies to ruin in the coming years.  And what happens when USD, the world's reserve currency slowly loses its reserve status and all of a sudden foreigners don't need any dollars anymore.  They will come flooding back to the US to buy anything real that people can still get for them.  Inflation in this (or any other realistic) view could get ugly.  Gold 2.0 will look very nice then, especially with it's paper receipts on top (lightning++ whatever that looks like).
The fact that fiats fail and lose most of their purchasing power over time highlights the fact that there is something wrong with the system.  It will unravel as it always does, and when it hits you, crypto will look like a godsend.

Plenty of people in the austrian camps easily identified and called the housing bubble and an associated coming recession as far back as 2005-2006, in the run-up to the 2008 crash.
Many got the crash right, but still failed to see the bigger picture of a complete meltdown and market selloff of EVERY ASSET CLASS, so even though they called the crash, they didn't exactly avoid losing money during the crash.
No matter who you are, how smart or even correct your ideologies, how connected you are, calling 10 out of the last 5 crashes but not being able to make money when the crash is happening doesn't make a "correct" prediction worth shit.

I actually said "ATM owners."
The owner of an ATM company himself told me he did not have to register as an MSB.
Apparently, the operator of an ATM is often different than the owner.  Then they pay "operators" to go around filling their machines back up with cash.
Thus the operator is not the guy who who would be doing stuff to the software on the machine.  If that were the case I think this offering would have happened a lot faster.

Is that how you categorize bitcoin?
Bitcoin is a revolutionary technology that allows man for the first time in history to move any amount of value globally, to anyone in any jurisdiction, nearly instantly and for almost no fee, all without having to trust a third party with the funds.  It is also decentralized, making it censorship resistant.
On top of all that it is cryptographically scarce, yet open source and programmable, and anyone can use it without permission.
You think of it as an investment.  For many this is our way of life now.  Vastly superior to the old system, which WILL eventually crumble under its own dead weight.

Interesting indeed.  I wonder if BitMEX (et al, if you guys have a line to the research dept) would care to comment on / add something in about Banks' off balance sheet derivatives liabilities.  Looking at reports from the OCC:
If we compare [Q3 2008]( to [Q3 2018]( 39):
**2008 Top 25 Banks/Holding Cos**:
Total assets on books: **$11 Trillion**
Total derivatives liabilities off books: **$184 TRILLION**, including $109 TRILLION in swaps
**2018: Top 25 Banks/Holding Cos**:
Total assets: **$14 Trillion**
Total derivatives liabilities off books: **$271 TRILLION**, including $132 TRILLION in swaps
I'm just a layman but this seems excessive to say the least.  If CDS/swaps on bad MBSes are what turned against these very banks and caused system-wide insolvency in 2008, what is to keep it from happening again?  What, do they have options to hedge their swaps this time, or what is different?  What happens when the market turns against their derivatives?

Everyone except half the country.  Assange always has served his own interests, which sometimes coincide with the interests of "the people".  I think in this case, the leaking of emails which expose certain scandals is a good thing.  He is (was) a force for good in this world, exposing lies, corruption and government malfeasence.  It doesn't truly matter what the source of the leaked emails was and I think we would all welcome the leaking of "republican" emails just the same.

Just to add a little more info for those who aren't very familiar with PGP: Anyone, even you dear reader, could make a PGP key for any email you want, and backdate it and upload it to a keyserver.
The fact that this fakleiman PGP key was also generated with ciphers that were not preferred (or not even integrated into the GnuPG library?) until years after the key's supposed creation time, *just like Faketoshi's other fake, backdated PGP keys* is a damning and tell-tale sign that it is a fake.

I got these numbers from the actual administrative code itself.  I will admit it is a bit convoluted and thus somewhat confusing to read through, but if you could provide a source for your crazy made up numbers (like $2000), I would be glad to see it.
Money Transmitters' limit is $1000 per person per day, above which they must ID.  Money Services Businesses are different, you are not even necessarily an MSB unless you are doing $10,000 per person per day (in my reading of the code), at which point you will need a license if operating commercially.

I am sure they (sounds like *you* they way you're so hot and bothered about this) hired special lawyers "to ensure they're properly complying with regulators" but regulators are not the law.

Are you really arguing against more privacy?  Crazier than your other views!
It does add a layer of network protection.  Just because they can tell which IP and port you connect to doesn't mean they have to be able to see the content you're fetching.  Without HTTPS it is a network observer free-for-all.

Setup your transaction, pick a fee.  For amount, hit the MAX button.  1 output results.

@_date: 2019-01-27 03:18:06


In short, using plenty of (increasingly outdated) assumptions.


This assumption is broken by plenty of custodial wallets and exchanges which batch transactions from UTXOs which don't belong to the original wallet-holder.  It is also intentionally broken in a trustless way by [CoinJoin]( wallets like [WasabiWallet](and [JoinMarket](and custodial, 3rd party mixers obviously.


There is no foolproof way to tell which output is change and which is the payment, though some (especially older) wallets have tell-tale patterns they conform to.  Modern wallets with some semblance of privacy in mind (such as bitcoind) use outputs and utxo selection pretty randomly, moreso than in the past.  There are even BIPs such as [BIP-0069]( which attempt to format transactions in a standard way to break output analysis.  Breaking the standard assumptions can be as easy as making 3 outputs in your transaction instead of the standard 2.


The transaction fee isn't specificially included in the transaction, but is calculated by subtracting the total output amount from the total input amount. 


It is getting harder and harder, luckily!


Again it depends on the wallet.  Almost all wallets use BIP-032/39/44 hierarchical deterministic wallets, and many will let you create multiple HD seeds.  So all bets are off if they use their change wisely.  Others have "coin control", that is, manual selection for specific control of utxos within each hd wallet, such as bitcoind, electrum, and wasabiwallet.


Not in a provable way, only guesses; like they were both used to fund the same transaction, which again is increasingly a faulty assumption.


Yes, you can import an array of private keys for different addresses into the same wallet and use them all as inputs to the same transaction.  This is very easy in wallets like electrum.
If you really want to make great strides in documenting address ownership, run some electrum servers, and log which wallets ask for the balances of a series of addresses.
@_date: 2019-01-19 00:57:37


TRUE.  But one doesn't need an MSB license if you are doing amounts below that.  Those amounts are what define who needs to be a regulated entity.

Sure, for instruments which count as monetary value under the 2015 directive.  As stated previously in this thread Bitcoin doesn't seem to be included until the 2018 directive, which member states are advised to pass local legislation to comply with, within a period of something like 3 years.

What are the limits?  Unless they're over $1000 per person per day and you don't keep the coins on hand, this sounds like total BS to me.  If you do keep your own coins on hand for a simple trade, the limit is $10,000 per person per day before you have to ID.   Maybe coinstar wants to be overcautious or maybe you do - but someone is not simply complying with the law, you are introducing unnecesary hurdles.  4% AND you record my info?  I believe people are going to tell you NO THANKS!  I'll pay less than 1% and buy through a real exchange.  Or I'll pay a couple more % and not give ID.
Ok, then turn the change instead of bills option on then so we don't have to go through the KYC BS!  Happy to pay the higher fees not to submit to unnecessary surveillance.


The people don't want or need "accounts".  We want to be able to not have to give an deep-vein asshole scan (or even ID) every time we want to turn a few dollars into bitcoin.

Can you actually swap coins for cash with someone in person or is it just altcoin trading?

It isn't really about whether the exchange actually has your bitcoins on hand (most do), but for users to actually hold their own bitcoin.  You can do it as good or better than some untrustable third party, by just transferring it to your computer.  Backup the seed phrase and password and then pat yourself on the back, because you are now in the future!
Transfer a few Satoshis to to your phone to help you play around with it and see that yes, you are actually holding it, and yes, it actually works.  Then one day when you see a Bitcoin symbol at a register, spend it!

1. Start with Monero
2. Open TorBrowser
3. Navigate to xmr.to's onion address
4. Buy bitcoin with your XMR

Maybe his question was poorly phrased; but this is not the correct answer.  I think you both misunderstood the question.
I will try rephrasing for him: "Among the block hashes which would have still been valid had the difficulty been even higher than it was, which block has the greatest difference between the real difficulty at the time and the highest difficulty at which it would have still been valid?" ... if that makes any more sense.

Mostly I just want to have fun but also I want to avail bitcoin of scammers.  It would be fun to watch him squirm because I know the 160 char format of twitter is perfect for him to twat out his nonsense to unsuspecting noobs and fools.  Misinterpreting someone on twitter is easy due to its constraints, and that is a great defense when you can't actually explain the bullshit that spews from your own mouth.  So naturally Wright is in heaven there.

I agree.  Though coins are held in addresses, we should be precise in our language.  Slip of the fingers!
@_date: 2019-05-25 16:33:14
Well in that case you will either want to send them a privacy coin like Monero (or possibly Zcash if used correctly and our assumptions are correct about its privacy), or after you recieve the bitcoins to your own wallet, put them through a wasabi wallet coinjoin, then send them to your "friend".

Correct me if I'm wrong but isn't this what Jeff Garzik (or some other snake? Good riddance in any event!) wanted to build into bitcoin - KYC/blacklists at the protocol level, and had the audacity to call it a Bitcoin **Improvement** Proposal?

^ this.  It shows the monumental hubris of Jihan Wu et al.  If there is ever a network partition (funnily enough this is most likely in China if through state action) lasting more than 10 blocks, there will forever be 2 Bcashes.  No chance for reconvergence.

Also if this movement has any steam, transaction fees will be going up.
@_date: 2018-12-02 08:36:55
Chainalysis has themselves claimed that when transactions do not meet extremely rigid norms that many wallets default to, a manual analysis must be performed to determine what is actually going on with a transaction.  Add many rounds of coinjoin and unless there's undisclosed, bewildering wizardry going on, things get pretty bleak for the analyzers.
Guess who traditional KYC providers turn to when providing banks and exchanges with crypto kyc risk analysis scores?  That's right, Chainalysis, and one or two other companies.
It's hard to blacklist coins that have no significant statistical link to each other.

Shit, uninformative article.  All this and more was covered multiple times over in the last couple days, and what's with the dig at the end?  It is not even noteworthy when an altcoin steals your schnorr construction (without attribution) and rebrands it as their own in the most useless way possible just to beat you to the punch.
