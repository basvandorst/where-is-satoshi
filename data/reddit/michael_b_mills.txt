So after 10 hours of trying, I have come to the conclusion that Bitcoin is impervious to by Jedi mind trick of trying to manipulate the price to 35000$.  It just keeps dropping.  Hmm, come to think of it, maybe I should try again, but this time focus on manipulating the price down?

Yeah, cos it's going down to 4800$ and that's when I move into Lambo city.

At least it seems I am not the only one who thinks we could see another drop before the bull run.  I just feel it in my bones.  I a'int selling nothing, but I do have a few $$ to buy in if we ever see another drop

Last year I was able to raise $25000 for the 48 hour bike for sick kids thanks to BTC.  This year $50000? Maybe if the market picks up.

I watched a really good Elliot wave chart analysis.  Looks like another downward trend will hit us in March, maybe as low as 4800$ before reaching for the moon.  Bring it on I say, I want to buy, buy, buy and just waiting for that low super good deal.  
@_date: 2018-02-23 20:04:24
I heard it becomes real at 4800$

Not sure why anyone one would short/leverage short when bitcoin was so low in value.  Goodbye greedy people, goodbye noobs, goodbye mr. Who remortgaged his house because he thought he could rich with bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-07-19 12:20:06
Lol, buy low sell high.  Do it, it’s so easy!!!!  Even pro traders lose 2 of every 5 trades placed on average.  Retail traders mainly don’t have a chance.

Elliot wave can be applied to BTC as with anything.  It has served me well these last few years in the crypto space, however anyone who relies solely on Elliot wave is an idiot as other TA strategies should be applied to help with probabilities

I’m pretty impressed, not so much with the setup but with the temperature.  You see most people think computer equipment needs to run in super chilled environments.  The number of clients I’ve visited and walked into their fridge of a server room will boggle the mind.  But 40 c or 104 f shows the guy knows pretty much what he is doing. 
I have a team of server techs that where shorts and tshirts in our data centre.

Dude, it’s really very simple.   Shorting is more risky than going long.  We are close to the price where it becomes unprofitable to mine bitcoin.  This unprofitability is a support level, probably the biggest support level bitcoin has and one not everyone is familiar with.  Therefore the probability of bitcoin going lower than the cost to mine is less than the possibility of the price increasing. Shorting at these prices is an extremely risky thing to do.  See nice and simple, no K2 bullshit this or T bullshit that.
