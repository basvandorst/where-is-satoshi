I find that when services get hyped so much so long before release that when it does get released its a crushing disappointment.

Don't use coinbase if you can help it.

Knowledge of how the the fed or BoE come to their decisions are proprietary knowledge and most reporting on such is an educated guess. Bitcoin, blockchain and similar technologies therein are public domain knowledge and has been seen since their creation, if you have an understand C you can just go to the github and read them.

I use the term never changes a bit liberally, theres new gold being mined every day. But its a much lower inflation rate than fiat plus if I buy a gold necklace for 1500 fake dollars, then fake country A collapses and cant honour the value of the fake dollar I can go to fake country B I can sell it for nearly as many Fake Pesos(gotta take fake Jeweller A and B profit margins) as it would to match the buying power as 1500 Fake Dollars at the market value they had the day I bought it.

Way in the past we used gold as currency(before that it was tangible goods like animals or people(slaves(indentured labour), daughters hand in marriage/virginity(dowry))), but people also enjoyed the security and convenience of a bank and didn't want to carry all that heavy gold. So the first banks issued coins or paper notes and that was worth the value of gold written on the coin/paper so that people could trade in gold with having to carry it about and securing paper/coins is easier than bars of gold, it could even be kept on your person. Then the banks starting printing/minting more of these tokens than there was gold in the bank to facilitate loans and risky trading strategies on the basis not ALL the people would withdraw ALL the gold at the same time. Now come to Bitcoin, that ALSO has the same sort of value (they are supposed to be worth the electricity/hardware processing time it took to generate the) and fiat currency (paper/tokens also called dollars, pounds, euros, yen) fluctuates around these constants even though it doesn't seem so because those paper/tokens were around when we were born and is all modern people seem to need. I could explain further but I would need to write an essay with a proper bibliography.

Also Drugs and Guns can also be stores of value if you want to look into the distopian future of money. (if there is no Government to back a currency)

A Greek switch to Bitcoin will cause a price spike due to demand then a so called 'crash' when its value normalises and supply outweighs demands again. Bitcoin is the the transfer of wealth not a store. In reality smart Greeks will invest in gold because it stays the same value (and all other currencies fluctuate.) The real problems will be in a couple of weeks if the government collapses so they wouldn't be able to fund a police force (or even have a currency to pay them with) and everyone has their currency/precious earth materials under their metaphorical bed will cause a crime wave. Also with the Middle East not to far away meaning weapons would be easy to come by. That is the point when Bitcoin will prevail.

They should allow .ac.uk (the british version of .edu) to parcipitate in this offer too.

or have each account assigned a bitcoin address as a general money storage account with the private key buried in the userdb as deep and encrypted as the password hash, to be able to use the service the service sends a challenge that is automatically signed using the bitcoin address. That will forgo the need to have any transactons with the service before connecting.

I thought the first bitcoin block was technically 'unspendable' so that is why satoshi doesen't use the private key that block is connected to. He could very well have other wallets.
If I was the inventor I would totally cash in on its success, its like being the queen (or royal family) spending money with her face (or for her family, with their mum/wife/sisters/grans face on it)

Don't open any file from anyone you don't know or not expecting. This applies to web links as well. Malware these days compromise a users email account, logs in to them and downloads a copy of your addressbook and message history and propagates via replies to email chains rather than sending a new email. This has been a very successful tactic in the last 6 months.

5 years ago or so, this sub was 90% articles on the technology of bitcoin and Blockchain (as at the time it was only one) and plans on hour to be free from stock traders, governments and investors from trading away our future with the other 10% being chat about its.value. Now those people are doing the same thing to bitcoin and I will admit I got caught up in the hype about its value too cause earning free money is great. However I want to find a sub a bit like this one five years ago. I also would like more influences such as the anarcho-capitalism and acknowlegement of all cryptocurrencies (without shitcoins being pumped).
I would also like to find another sub dedicated to the technology that goes into these coins and how to integrate them with your software.

Could you cover the embossing in something like magnetic putty so it looks blank on the xray?

I thought they wanted to be loud and proud if they think their revision is clearly better.

I'm on the verge of unsubscribing, too much of a storm brewing about the block size limits and hard forks. IMHO Bitcoin should stay current with demands to avert it becoming stale and worthless. Not gonna argue about it.

Are you still relevant?

Maybe the value of gold/bitcoins didn't go down, but the value of the dollar went up?

It will just display the blockchain.info site in a frame size of your choosing.
