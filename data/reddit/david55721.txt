That's because almost no wallets are even running segwit right now so all those transactions you are sending don't have segwit active.

Because it's essentially a Swiss bank account in your pocket. Each bitcoin costs $1000+ in computing power and electricity costs to make.

It will drop lower then $4200 this is healthy for bitcoin.

No one knows we can't tell the future
@_date: 2017-09-04 12:29:15
I think this is going to be healthy for bitcoin and we will rebound out of this. For now i think bitcoin will drop even lower

Well if u don't want bias I wouldn't ask here because here everyone will be biased towards bitcoin

You dont have to buy a film bitcoin. You can buy bitcoin 0.5,0.1, even 0.01 on bitcoin you neccesarily dont need to buy a whole bitcoin. But i get what you mean many other cryptos have a better short term ROI.

You can do the instant bitcoin cash out which requires no id but the cash out has to be over $100

If you are going to be putting alot of money in then you should put most of it into bitcoin.

@_date: 2017-09-03 19:37:33
If your going to mine then mine alt coins because it's not worth gpu mining btc
@_date: 2017-09-04 02:45:41
Yea well i personaly dont see any appeal to it as bitcoins fees are low now. Once LN and once segwit transactions are more of a regular thing the fees will be even better, making bitcoin cash less desirable.
