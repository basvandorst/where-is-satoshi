Well? Don't leave us waiting.

Thank you for checking the timestamps.

If the Bitcoin community works to point out and stop this behaviour it would prove we have the ability to regulate ourselves. Otherwise this sort of behaviour justifies the eventual regulation that faces the industry.

Depends on the news. If everything is fine, price will continue back on its rebound from 258.

Good move.

Where did I say that?
The owners have friends, and they probably heard the news first. It is not hard to believe some of those people in the BitStamp inner circle knowing that information sold their Bitcoin positions before the news was released. This is all possible without invoking what you claimed I suggested. In a more regulated industry that could be considered insider trading, and it is a possibility worth considering.

I don't know abut that, people are pretty trusting. MtGox got hacked early on.

Not illegal is not the equivalent to not irrelevant. If the Bitcoin community works to point out and stop this behaviour it would prove we have the ability to regulate ourselves. Otherwise this sort of behaviour justifies the eventual regulation that faces the industry.

Oh, then you are wrong. 
Though there is a point to be made how this new economy makes it very easy for hackers/scammers/criminals to secure large sums of anonymous money that can't be seized over the five years the experiment has ran.

What is? You need to clarify because that word is misunderstood and misused often.
@_date: 2015-01-05 20:49:35
Wow, thank you for sharing this. I wonder if anything else can be collected, this would be a clear case of insider trading.

Do you have to make it never happen to make it worth trying to limit it from happening? Your argument is childish.

Thanks for asking, that is a disturbing response.
