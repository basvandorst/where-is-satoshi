There is a complete breakdown in technology. There's no way Bitcoin or any other crypto can service mass consumerism. We saw that with huge delays and massive fees when cryptos were at peak interest. When I was running a full node of BTC, the blockchain was at around 165GB with about a day or two worth of equivalent Visa transactions. There is no possible way to decentralize a ledger of that size. People running full nodes (the people with voting rights on the blockchain) would need massive storage capacity if BTC ever was actually capable of processing enough transactions for mass consumerism.

Isn't bitcoin infinitely divisible?

Seriously, buy a pizza, just replace the Bitcoin you spent. If Bitcoin is to be Seriously, buy a pizza, just replace the Bitcoin you spent. If Bitcoin is to be widely adopted people need to spend it not just trade it among themselves or leave it rotting in a wallet for eternity until they lose it and forget where they wrote down their secret phrase.

Right. Bitcoin will likely never become mainstream for many reasons but one very important reason is scalability. Bitcoin could not keep up with demand if it became popular. Transactions would take days to confirm etc.
Bitcoin was/is a fascinating experiment and I've been a part of it (and a supporter)  since 2014 but I really don't believe it will ever become mainstream. Too many issues.

The Canadian banking system is nowhere near "extremely outdated".
Where do you guys come up with this shit?

Its a bitcoin shilling sub, always good for some laughs.

They are looking for new ways to convert btc to fiat. A "bitcoin" debit card doesn't even use bitcoin, it converts it first so that  merchants will accept it.  Not many places one can actually use bitcoin to buy anything.

It will probably have forked many times by then, creating millions of new "coins".
I'm fascinated by bitcoin and those who are so passionate about it. I disagree with most though, I don't believe bitcoin has a future and would never invest in it no matter what the price.
