No, I will never be paid in bitcoin so I'm basically being given a retirement fund that is smaller than my current retirement fund in USD.
Not to mention you now need to bring a third party in to make transactions for you every time you want to pay your electric bill, go to the mall, go to the gas station, etc.  
If people in this thread actually sat there and thought about it, they would really realize that what they're doing by saying yes is committing themselves to a life plagued by a heavily restricted market.  It's just they like the side they're on this time.  They would be spending a large amount of time managing things our current system has trivialized.
Reinventing the wheel, if you will.
Maybe people are bored, I don't know.

This isnt silent.  Its in writing.  Its also "common knowledge."  
Am I surprised poor people get more overdrafts?  Well I have never known "poor people" to be exceptionally skilled at managing their finances.  Bit of the old chicken/egg there.

Well, it's best that you see for yourself.
Go to tradingview.com/e and load up a chart.  On the right you have standard markets you can load up.  You can load up the S&amp;P500 (SPX), or the Euro/Dollar (EURUSD) or whatever you like and get a full daily chart.  
Right click on the Y-axis (price) and click Log Scale.
Toggle that setting back and forth as you go through the symbols.  BTCUSD is in there by default I believe.  Have fun playing around (zoom in and out with your scroll wheel).  Tradingview is a great site.  You can do overlays and use indicators and what not.  It's pretty awesome.

It's the parallel in attitude and mindless shilling that I find amusing.
Those that stand to profit from X will publicly cheer for X.  The first sentence of the blog article says everything that matters.

At least post a reasonable chart.  There isn't a trader in the world that would use whatever the fuck it is you're looking at.  One of the images in the sidebar is a more [normal]( looking chart.

so then the end user is just paying a markup for the service, if the service provider can just continually transfer btc to the machine, right?
@_date: 2014-04-04 09:46:51
How would you do this without taking massive risk?  You would have to buy bitcoins in bulk up front and vend them out over time, how does this not leave you open to getting assfucked by volatility and price drops?
@_date: 2014-04-12 18:34:22
It's weird how this thread is going already.  Thread response:


If your decentralization system is just redundant propagation you will have very real security concerns.  If it's segmented distribution then the use of the word 'but' here is incorrect.  The word should be 'and.'  Having a single point of failure is an upside, not a downside.  If I decentralize something in a segmented fashion, across 10 nodes, I have 10 points of failure.  All it takes is one of those 10 points to fail and I am fucked.  If I centralize, there's only one point of failure.  If these points have equal probability of failing, the decentralized model has a far higher probability of failing than a centralized one.  In addition, redundant backups in a centralized system further reduce the probability of failure, because you would have to have your single point of failure fail along with every backup point fail. 
The pizza analogy always works well for decentralization - let's say I want to decentralize a pizza.  In a redundant propagation system I would need to order a pizza for every node - this is a huge efficiency issue (and security issue if nodes look inside the box!).  In a segmented system, I am cutting up the pizza and giving a slice to each node - all it takes is one of those nodes to get hungry and I am fucked.
Also, stipulating it as (emphasis mine)"*nothing more* than a design choice" trivializes the very serious nature of the "application-specific costs and benefits."

lol what?  what fucking banks are you guys using and who the fuck are you talking to when you call them about your issues?
Im calling bullshit if youre in the US and your bank just tacked on a fee to a debit purchase like you say and then justified it to you like you say
@_date: 2014-04-12 05:24:46
I don't think it's a wise idea to let people off the hook for being correct while not having to display they actually truly know why they are correct.  This is math.  I don't take this shit lightly!
I would have bet a lot of money that, in a face to face conversation, he would have folded immediately if pressured to elaborate.  I would further bet that he would never use the term "interval" and the word "logarithmic" would make his eyes gloss over.
I didn't downvote you btw, not sure who did.  I would normally not even vote on your comment but I think you deserve to be above the horizon.

I like how you get blindly upvoted for just saying things like "banks rip people off" and "they fuck you."
No substance at all to your post, but here it is...at the top.

That's in the stock market, where the average annual gain is ~7%.  
This is not the stock market -  at all.  Understanding this difference is absolutely required if you are going to talk about serious investment strategy.
You should have a stop-loss (and profit targets) placed the second you enter your order.

Oh, yeah, I was more pointing out that the implementation of what is basically a debit card for bitcoin is being heralded as "very cool" when it's nothing new and how regular currency already works.  I thought it was funny, that's all.
@_date: 2013-11-01 02:49:36
Bookmark this thread and get back to me in a year then.  I will bet everything I own versus everything you own that fiat currencies are still top dog.  I don't even know how you could argue this.
And by the way, some third world fuck nothing country with a GDP of 8 bananas and a goat adopting BTC as its currency doesnt count for shit.  All I'm saying herenis that the best case scenario for you in reality doesn't hold water.
@_date: 2013-12-07 01:30:18
How is this very cool?  It's a fucking debit card.  WOAH GUYS ITS 1990 AGAIN
@_date: 2013-11-01 05:19:32
You can either work with the systems we have or live outside of its comforts.  But until bitcoin is fully integrated into the system you will be paid in and paying your bills in fiat currency.   If you want to lose money to exchange fees to turn it into bitcoin in between, that's on you.

The dollar has lost all of its value?  Are you joking?  The world will go on without it?  Are you kidding me?  The world would spiral into a new dark age if the dollar collapsed.
@_date: 2013-12-07 02:27:21
For me it's because I'm okay with a gold and silver coin.  But 400 coins made by changing versions, naming them like marijuana strains and then dumping them into a market is over the top.  It's entirely unwarranted, too.  There's no need for that shit, yet.
@_date: 2013-11-01 08:06:45
Money has ALWAYS been that way.  This isn't a new concept.  We all agree it has value because it's in our best interest to do so.  This is how ANYTHING has value.  Backing doesn't mean shit.  It can be backed by gold but that means we all agree that gold has a specific value.  IT'S ALL THE SAME THING.  BITCOIN IS NO DIFFERENT.  Bitcoin has value because the market has agreed it has value.  How is it any different?
You seem to think that bitcoin is somehow a solution to fiat currency because fiat currency has problems X,Y, and Z when bitcoin has all of the same characteristics AND MORE.
I'm not saying bitcoin is worthless, I'm saying it will never replace fiat currency.  A lot of those reasons are incredibly basic and often touted as positives for bitcoin which is hilarious.  
Bitcoin solves precisely zero of the problems you think exist (many of which aren't even problems, they are simply the way things are and you seem to not like that, oh well), and to top it off its a finite deflationary currency which is INCREDIBLY DANGEROUS.  If you think deflation is a good thing, take a look at Japan (doing everything it can to address deflation) and the Eurozone (latest prints show decreasing inflation which is a MASSIVE concern).
You've been convinced that our current system doesn't work and that it's failed.  I got news for you, it's done exactly what we expect it adheres to the theory.  Look at the business cycle, we naturally follow it.  It just lasts longer than you think it does and you expect things to continually get worse because the bust---&gt;consolidation period lasts a measurable amount of time.  Talk to me in 5-10 years when we're in another boom.

I like Jeffery Tucker, he's a pretty solid guy but he's out of his depth here and a lot of the things he says in this article are either mistranslated (which I would bet on given how slanted RT is, they HATE the USA) or are purely dishonest.  You pointed out one example.  I'll point out a few more:


This would make most economists laugh, which makes me think he didn't say it or he was unwilling to discuss volatility because there is no really good argument for it.  Bitcoin is volatile as fuck.


There's no way he said this.  I know he's a libertarian, but good lord that is a fucking stupid thing to say.
EDIT:  Apparently there's a video of this, which I am afraid to watch because I don't want to hear him actually say that.  
@_date: 2013-12-12 03:10:42
The post wasn't about basic supply and demand, it was about an idea on how to be a profitable market maker, and it's wrong from top to bottom.

While he's speaking from a US perspective, the overall message he's conveying has nothing to do with the states.  You gain recognition through regulation - period.  Governments will have to put measures in place.  Until then, bitcoin isn't viable as a currency.  
Do you think gold is unregulated?  Think about how gold works, that's how bitcoin will have to work.  That is, quite honestly, the absolute best case scenario for bitcoin.
Realistically it's unnecessary as a currency at all.  We seriously do not need it.  But if we're going to use it, it will have to be regulated to gain traction in the commercial world and be offered as an investment from commercial services and to retail investors.  This means that the major countries of the world will need to work (preferably in unison) at adopting bitcoin through legislation that carves out the framework for the industry and provides the necessary regulations to satisfy commercial investors.

No one does serious payroll with bitcoin and they never will.  Citing a few small businesses and individuals that essentially accept all of their payment in bitcoin because their business is based off of it is insufficient, to say the least.  They are a flash in the pan as well.
One month ago I said "treat it like gold, regulate it, trade it, but it will never replace fiat currencies"
Look at what happened in China.
I'm clairvoyant (or more likely not a complete moron buying into utopian hype from neo-libertarians spouting nonsense).  Good thing we downvote anti-hivemind!

Yeah, because when I buy stuff online I am paying in rupiah and baht.  You fucking moron.
The internet comparison is horrendous and falls flat on its face the minute you actually think about it for more than a half second.  
Somewhere along the line some of the bitcoin people became convinced that fiat currencies are shitty and destined to fail.  I don't know how this happened, but if you are in that camp you are a fucking moron with a piss poor grasp on basic economics.

@_date: 2013-11-01 01:19:47
But he didn't mean that.  You will never be paid in bitcoin precisely because there is no central issuing authority or regulation.  This is also why no one ever pays you in gum.
Your housing analogy is incorrectly posited.
He's a smart guy and he knows this.

If you think that bitcoin has been adopted already you're a fucking idiot.
@_date: 2013-11-01 01:49:58
I don't think you understand how payroll and corporate accounting work, let alone serious big boy financial accounting.  Until bitcoin is loaned by banks, it will not be used to pay employees.  It will never be loaned by banks because there is no central issuing authority.
This is one of the problems with the bitcoin hype machine.  Most people have no clue how complicated finance and accounting actually are.  Yet they somehow conclude that our current "system" (as if its just one thing) is riddled with problems and that bitcoin exists outside of this system (it doesn't) and/or can replace it (it can't) because its better (its not).
Treat it like gold, regulate it, trade it, but it will never replace fiat currencies which makes using it more costly than just sticking with a debit card because you will forever have to convert to/from it.
@_date: 2013-12-06 23:30:23
Because it's a speculative investment.  China nailed it, it's a commodity - and a super volatile one.

Wow if you want to compare the world pre electrification and fucking running water, go nuts, but this is a completely different world we live in and we have it this way precisely BECAUSE of the systems you ridicule.  You, your parents, your grandparents and their grandparents all constitute "recent history" so get off your horse and get some fucking serious perspective if you're going to time travel.  Thanks for clarifying how bartering works and defining exactly why we moved into currency, though, almost makes me want to go back in time and watch them expand trade with currency.
@_date: 2013-11-01 00:17:26
I think you're getting that wrong.
The world will keep going with or without bitcoin.  Because the world doesn't care.
The world is governed by fiat currencies.  This will not change in your lifetime and you are delusional if you think otherwise.
