@_date: 2015-08-03 17:46:47
well once the majority of the world wants into the bitcoin game then I'm sure they would want cheaper coins. Thus with more new players the majority could want more coin supply. Can the devs be strong enough in the face of all this pressure to keep the limit at 21 million? Also if we are relying on the decisions of the devs to keep the protocol as satoshi intended then how is this not arbitrary? Bitcoin is supposed to be trustless, we are giving a lot of trust to those in control.
@_date: 2015-08-04 03:19:31
I'm saying when the masses want to all get into bitcoin and find it to be too expensive because psychologically they want to have at least 1 "full" bitcoin. Thus the majority of bitcoin users will be in favor of increasing the limit.

Satoshi deserves to be rich for creating this technology. I wouldn't care one bit if he sold all his btc and crashed the price because then I would be able to buy more.

Once you get a trezor you will never want anything else. I don't know how I went so long without one. I highly recommend it.
@_date: 2015-08-03 17:48:32
if the increase in total coin supply would drive the demand up from people wanting to purchase a full bitcoin, the exchanges stand to make a profit from increased trading volume. an increase in block rewards might also an incentive for miners to demand such a change.

It's been 8 confirmations. I had opened the app and sent the bitcoins, the wallet showed that it was receiving. Then the next time I opened the app it said my balance was 0 btc which is strange because I had some dust in it before the transaction. This is not a normal wait and see problem.
@_date: 2015-07-26 02:22:25
Normally it says receiving x amount of bitcoins. Now it does not even say that.

how would they shut it down?

sorry but lightning network wasn't satoshis idea.

feds? us doesnt run the world lol
@_date: 2018-02-28 21:41:04
Segwit and lightning network are changes to bitcoin. Satoshi set out what bitcoin was originally. It seems like people are picking and choosing what to change. I don't see why after enough crying, the 21 million coin limit won't also be changed. Changing things like this, the very protocol of bitcoin, is a dangerous road that we already started down.
@_date: 2018-02-28 14:41:45
No I didnt lmao.
@_date: 2018-02-28 15:31:24
so lets put it out and see what happens. seems like rolling the dice. which is not okay when people have their lives invested in it.
@_date: 2018-02-09 10:23:01
lightning network goes against the fundamental idea of bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-02-28 16:19:00
so they should have created an alt coin instead of changing BITCOIN
@_date: 2018-02-28 14:15:55
then the hashrate will fall and be easily susceptible to a 51% attack.
@_date: 2018-02-28 15:00:00
50 to 25 to 12.5 to 6.5 to 3.25 to 1.625, ect ect
each halving is a large change to the amount of bitcoin rewarded. also the price of mining a bitcoin in terms of electricity, that falling also means that the hashrate is falling, which is not a good thing.

there are so many unknowns when looking into the future. That is a possibility. But why introduce such volatility when the existing structure did not have these potential problems?
@_date: 2018-02-28 14:42:42
it is not adjusted. it's fixed in the form a block reward that halves.
@_date: 2018-02-28 16:01:02
they fundamentally changed bitcoin with what it seems to be in a rushed manner and with little foresight.
1. fee structure 
2. recording everything which was set out in the white paper.
I'm saying that I don't agree and that it was a bad idea.
@_date: 2018-02-28 15:38:26
yes the transactions are registered but not in the way satoshi envisioned. that is a major issue.
@_date: 2017-09-08 15:14:34
how about we let the market decide
@_date: 2018-02-28 16:20:35
those with valid concerns and urging caution seem to constantly be overrun by the unwashed masses haha. glad to see others with the same concerns.
@_date: 2018-02-28 15:11:24


if bitcoin usage exploded the issue would be taken care of. why add the extra layer of complexity of opening and closing channel fees when the original design already accounted for this? 1 transaction 1 fee. now there are more variables which translate to less money for miners. that one change can have huge and as of now unknown effects on the entire ecosystem.
@_date: 2018-02-28 16:13:30
they could have done that with fees being .0001
@_date: 2018-02-28 15:50:33
but why fundamentally alter the way bitcoin works in the following ways?
1. fee structure
2. the bigger issue of recording everything which was set out in the white paper.
@_date: 2018-02-28 15:16:12
perhaps it is a technological development, but that term has positive connotations, which may not manifest in reality but in actuality effects of the change may in fact effect bitcoin negatively.
I have no desired outcome. I was always against this form of scaling solution. And as a bitcoin holder I was forced to comply with this change against my will. I only hope the people driving this ship have not unknowingly steered us onto the rocks.
you can say I could get an alt coin, but lets be honest bitcoin is where it is at. I am just pointing out that I don't agree that this was a good idea. It's not my fault if the whole thing goes down. Thats why I think this was a short sighted and rushed solution. Did they carefully think about all the possible implications of such a huge change? Were they so arrogant that they thought they could see every outcome? who will be held accountable if it fails due to this change where it otherwise would have been fine without it?
@_date: 2018-02-28 15:34:34
that is true. however changing the blocksize was something satoshi originally suggested. the main issue is that lightning network has fundamentally altered the PREMISE of bitcoin itself.
@_date: 2018-02-28 14:47:08
yes that is true. My issue is that they are changing the function of the protocol. Yes bitcoin can fall to 5k without a lightning network. However the fact remains that miners would make less in fees than if the lightning network didnt exist. 
"Less new blocks will increase on-chain transactions fees."
why would people transact on chain vs lightning if fees are lower?
@_date: 2018-02-28 15:02:11
well seeing the structure of bitcoin, I don't see how my logic does not follow.
50 to 25 to 12.5 to 6.5 to 3.25 to 1.625, ect ect
the number of bitcoins mined will drop dramatically. lightning network reduces the amount of money miners make. and miners = security.
@_date: 2018-02-28 15:37:10
what happens 1 halving from now? or 2 or 3? 
this change was unnecessary. how do you know there would be more people using bitcoin because of LN than it would have gotten otherwise?
@_date: 2017-09-01 11:56:33
I must've lost 10 btc gambling. hurts bruh
@_date: 2018-02-28 14:56:29
I was always okay with high on-chain fees.
"If people want to implement/use Lightning, no one can stop it and if technological development leads to the decline of bitcoin, so be it.. It hasn't deserved to live if it can be killed like that."
You are assuming that this protocol change is a technological development. I'm saying it's an unnecessary risk to make a fundamental change to the function of bitcoin. The road to hell is paved with good intentions.
@_date: 2018-02-28 15:19:59
I might get crucified, but why not just increase the blocksize instead of adding something completely new?
I wrote this earlier but:
I was always against this form of scaling solution. And as a bitcoin holder I was forced to comply with this change against my will. I only hope the people driving this ship have not unknowingly steered us onto the rocks.

@_date: 2018-02-28 13:45:03
if fees are so low why would miners keep mining when the block reward goes lower? lightning network might kill bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-02-28 15:36:08
you can't assume that lightning network will increase demand more than bitcoin would have originally have received.
lightning network will reduce the amount of BITCOIN miners get. how is that debatable?
@_date: 2018-02-28 16:10:02
they created the lightning network and attached that to bitcoin. thats forcing me to support it if I remain invested in bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-02-28 15:32:40
obviously I'm highly invested in bitcoin. which means I also have bcash.
@_date: 2015-09-24 08:50:01
I'll stay with the trezor thanks.
@_date: 2018-02-28 17:18:28
the devs should have made an alt coin then and not changed bitcoin. because bitcoin as it is now is not the invention of satoshi. and clearly it is centralized to an extent if the devs had enough power to change this. What's next? the 21 million coin limit? we already set a bad precedent.
@_date: 2015-09-22 00:03:58
LMAOOOO transactions signed by "our server" whos to say your company will be around in 10 years? trezor still best.
@_date: 2015-09-25 05:41:32
@_date: 2015-09-16 02:18:27
You are censoring. All of your arguments are void because the very act of censoring goes against the spirit of bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-11-05 02:02:15
because they havn't sold already to pay bills?
@_date: 2015-11-05 07:37:35
Bitcoin doesn't need this. You need bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-10-11 11:01:13
bro never trust anybody else with your private keys. if you dont have the private keys, you dont have bitcoins.
@_date: 2016-10-13 01:20:27
who cares? btc will succeed regardless of whether or not the powers that be approve of it.

just export your priv key

you are so stupid.

Lmao. Of course it uses alot of electricity. It is a global currency!
@_date: 2015-10-08 01:03:23
Anybody who does any basic research on bitcoin will see that is not the case
@_date: 2015-10-08 08:06:30
damn now I must pay 3 pennies for my transaction instead of 1 LOL
@_date: 2016-07-10 13:01:59
you're growing weed fool.
@_date: 2017-06-22 07:56:07
they are waiting for the price to fall
