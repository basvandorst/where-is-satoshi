The Cato Institute is full of conservative nonsense, imo

Yeah and the idea that anyone who wants bigger blocks is a sophisticated shill, maliciously pumping BCH is ridiculous.  I don't hold any significant amount of either, but I still hold the opinion that 1mb blocks are way too small and that segwit seems like an inadequate solution to a much larger problem.

Am obviously exaggerating how hard it would be to accomplish, but AFAIK the block size is literally defined as a constant in 1 line of code.  Also, all you did was call me stupid.  Don't really see how that's helpful or responsive.

But he does control the flow of information in one of the most popular places to discuss bitcoin (183k subscribers) so...
@_date: 2016-07-26 19:55:37
Can you explain this a little more?  How could a large block break Bitcoin?

Can someone explain to me why we shouldn't change 1 line of code to solve the scalability issue?  Honestly, this seems like a no-brainer with blocks filling up and fees increasing.  Seems like full blocks and failure to act by the core devs will just cause people to switch to another currency like eth.

ETH seems fine, tbh.  I doubt ETC will survive for long and even if it does, what's the impact to ETH?
Also Satoshi was in favor of an eventual block size increase:  
@_date: 2016-07-01 15:02:54
But blocks are full now and the amount of code required for a block size increase is incredibly small.

Sure, it saves some space and that's great, but it's not nearly enough to solve the problem of constantly full blocks and a huge backlog in the mempool

You do realize that not everyone who disagrees with you is a paid shill, right?

LOL wtf are you talking about m8

I made a transaction using a recommended fee 36 hours ago and it hasn't been confirmed.  Something needs to be done.
