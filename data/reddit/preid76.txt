They should ship those FREE with all the miners for the wait we've had to go through.

so I would have to convert to EUR and then do the SEPA transfer right? That still ends up being cheaper?

Google put in about $60K assuming each people at I/O had a US gmail address. I would be glad to send you something if I get some. I'll even refund the person that sent it to me in the first place. I'm talking pennies here just to start the service.
@_date: 2013-05-20 16:00:40
I was thinking about doing the same. It's like all the people selling books on how to get rich, they get rich selling you the book lol.

Man, I would never use that road. Imagine if the RFID is malfunctioning lol. There were so many problems with the little padded automatic gates on our toll road here in South Florida that they took them all off.

I've setup a gox account. It showed only 4 bitcoin in the volume section when I had the currency in CHF for today. Should I consider trading in a different currency?
@_date: 2013-05-19 03:45:40
Wow that's good to know, thanks.
@_date: 2013-05-16 19:41:05
Sounds like it would be too risky for the person selling as it seems pretty open for chargebacks. It also prohibits commercial use of P2P payments.
It would still be nice to have people from I/O send us pennies to grow the system and we can always return the funds back. This would only work on pure trust though.

If there's any staff or employees of localbitcoins here, please check the messages that were sent earlier today in order to take the coins back out of escrow please. We can provide any documentations requested.

I would love to, except I'm not at IO. :-\ I'm looking for someone that already got the wallet feature from IO to send me something. I don't think there's a minimum so I'll gladly take a penny and pass it back or along to another user wanting the service. I'll give 0.01BTC to whoever sends me an invite no matter how small.
@_date: 2013-06-14 20:53:46
I looked into it but it doesn't seem to have much volume for what I need. Thanks though
@_date: 2013-05-27 05:50:59
Dam, $4 worth from free Bitcoin website must have taken you a few days non stop. That's impressive. Have you tried bitinstant? I haven't checked their age restriction but that could be a start.
@_date: 2013-05-17 17:11:15
PM your gmail and I'll send you something to get you in.
@_date: 2013-05-10 17:40:39
I wish we had something like that in the US. Sounds like a good deal.
@_date: 2013-05-16 21:16:02
why is their 63GH/s cheaper than the 50GH/s? Also "why pre-order miners and wait a years?" Pretty unprofessional. 
This is gotta be a joke or something. Totally fake!
@_date: 2013-09-05 23:46:22
Same thing happened to me earlier today. Here's the phone number he used: (646) 580-2672

Nordstrom allows you to get cash on a transaction paid with a credit card? Most stores will refund I'm the way it was paid messing back on the card.
@_date: 2013-05-20 15:58:48
Did you do a wire transfer? Was it above $10k? Days have to be counted as banking days, so no weekends or holidays. 
Normally a wire is immediate from the time they send it from their bank to yours but they may need verification first. If by ACH, it could take 2-3 business days on average.
@_date: 2013-05-20 04:36:08
This is by far much more complicated than credit card fraud that merchants are exposed to daily. How easy is it to call the credit card company and just day your card was stolen even if you did make the transactions? This is a reason why processing fees on cc are so high. 
So it's actually safer to accept unconfirmed Bitcoin transaction than a credit card.
@_date: 2013-05-10 06:09:38
I'll have to double check that but I don't think you need coinbase in order to pay the merchant that uses it. From what I saw, it was just an interface that allowed people to send money to your wallet directly. Didn't matter where it came from.
@_date: 2013-06-15 23:20:01
What's the advantage of trading in USD or Euro? I'm ultimately gonna cash it in CHF anyway. Am I losing something by trading in CHF? I already got verified, just need to send the notorized stuff now
@_date: 2013-05-25 05:34:05
do you have any sources stating such?
@_date: 2013-05-20 15:04:01
I was referring to two factor authentication on online wallet like Blockchain.info. You can set a pin on your phone app too. It all depends what you install on it to. Malware just won't show up out of nowhere. I understand there's a risk, specially for people unaware of it and just installing anything, but I still think much more people are getting run in the streets add there will ever be with Bitcoin wallets. 
@_date: 2013-05-20 14:33:07
What happens when you lose such hardware wallet? I'm assuming you need backup of it. Cold storage seems like a better idea for long term savings. I think we just need to use software wallet like we do with our regular wallets, keep everyday cash in it, and rest saved up in different location such as cold storage in safety deposit or wherever you normally keep things safe right now.
It's a lot easier to get rub right now in the street and lose you actual wallet then it is with a software wallet. 2 factor authentication is pretty good security for everyday software wallets.

If you don't have sensors on your car, how do they catch you?

The RFID might work but the spike are still mechanical. Think about getting a jam in the up position

When are you planning it in Miami? I was thinking about coming up to Orlando, but if you come to Miami that's even better.

$0.40 a day adds up over time. And that's the fee you pay for the service, the city probably pays a transaction fee as well since they don't have to pay someone to collect money in the meters.

I was under the understanding that he only pre mined one block or so. The rest was mined after it was released. That's just what someone told me and I didn't bother to check. I think it makes a huge difference if it was pre mined vs mined in the early days. Bitcoin are only generated at 3600 or so per day no matter how many miners there are which is the reason for the difficulty fluctuating. 
@_date: 2013-05-10 06:49:46
Awesome, thank you! Still a lot but at least I have a an idea now of what to expect. 
@_date: 2013-05-26 05:46:14
Seems like coinbase gives you a better rate as well than campbx. At least at the moment of this post.
@_date: 2013-05-22 14:44:58
I'm already in it but thanks. I just felt I would ask, never know :P
@_date: 2013-05-17 06:56:08
Awesome, I'll check it out.
@_date: 2013-05-19 02:45:16
People were talking about that a month ago on here. Some coinstar shareholder said he would suggest it. I don't know how much power he's got though
@_date: 2013-05-15 03:38:06
site already down?
@_date: 2013-05-18 19:03:59
But it's processed by a third party company. So they have to take their cut as well. I'm sure the city has to pay for some fees. They save money by not having to collect and manage cash. 
@_date: 2013-05-07 05:50:44
does anyone know approximately how many orders they have for each of the devices since the pre-order? If they're shipping a handful at a time and they got hundreds of thousands, this will be years before we see anything.

So this guy (jimmcarr) on localbitcoins.com tried to scam my brother earlier today. He acted interested in purchasing some bitcoins and said he wanted to meet in a local bank. After several messages and texts exchanged, he ended up sending this link above and asked about the deal. This is a FAKE localbitcoins site. 
So now the coins are sitting in escrow. Thank god I had setup 2-step verification first because it was a total of 138 bitcoins which was just about $21K today.
I just want to tell people how important it is to setup 2-step verification and to be careful on localbitcoins even if you'll end up meeting the people in person.
@_date: 2013-05-15 04:38:59
I say wait till it bottoms down and buy cheap. Value will go back up.
@_date: 2013-09-05 23:38:20
yeah I just realized that. more people can get scam with the link. I'll repost
@_date: 2013-05-19 05:24:33
What a bunch of idiots! 
@_date: 2013-05-07 06:11:49
I was doing something wrong I guess. Thanks for the info it worked now.
@_date: 2013-05-26 05:42:48
I know it might be a little too late now but you can send bitcoins to someone who has access to Google wallet new sending money option and have them send you what you need and use you nexus 4 nfc at the gas station. 
You have to trust the person but that's an option. Google wallet saved me a few times in the past when I left my wallet home.
Btw, anyone wanting access to Google wallet money attachment, pm me your email and I'll send you an invite. Must be in the US as they verify last 4 of ssn and dob.

This is not a credit check. This data is pulled from public records. I worked for a large financial institution and we used that data all the time to verify the identity of the person we were speaking to. 
The information is compiled from drivers license, registered cars at your addresses and other things linked to you and your relatives. It was pretty creepy knowing that all this information could be found on someone. 
@_date: 2013-05-22 14:39:55
How much money are you sending? ;)
@_date: 2013-05-10 07:32:05
I know its a little late but here's a referral link if you still want to give it a try. 
@_date: 2013-05-18 17:44:43
That would be too easy to bypass. Can't have cameras at every scanner to make sure you paid each meter. Sounds a little extreme
