Yup, if they didn't you could restore your private keys to another wallet and try to double spend with a higher transaction fee and fuck their whole operation up.
That would make for a pretty funny Mr Robot skit.

Between TradeHill, Bitcoinica, MTGox, Vircurex, and McxNOW I've lost somewhere around 800, and they were all just active day trading funds. Then ya hit hard times and $30 looks infinitely better than $0. Still made a profit and there's no shame in that.

Are you saying the Internet Archive is a stupid charity? It's arguably one of the most important projects with a global impact to receive funding thus far, and it's not like there aren't third world based projects to receive funds yet (the water project has and what they do is amazing).
If anything this does exactly what you want by helping keep the internet (and old DOS games that run on almost anything now) free.
Unless funds are being legit wasted/misappropriated it's kinda unfair to say "so and so shoulda got the money instead"

This! All through high school we were warned how difficult the "real world" would be, but were never taught or even encouraged to learn things like CPR (emergency aide), financial planning, or local/state/federal law.

Turned out not to be a mining instance, but something related to another project. I agree though. If it had been it would have been understandable. In a case like this they should have contacted me first, and given me something like 24-72 hours to respond instead of just outright locking both me and their support team out.

Actually an inexpensive terminal where you can transfer coins from a wallet on one card to a wallet on another card (even if it's using a 3rd party hot wallet like coinkite) is a freakin awesome idea. It'd be a dedicated device and arguably better then using phones (especially when we can't even keep a stupid iOS wallet app).

You set a wiki-like donation up, and if X amount is reached you take away the 5% fee for X amount of time. That would promote bitcoinstarter as a long time community entity AND encourage projects looking for funding to use the site instead of doing it themselves.

My guess is that it's [this app](
Looks like you log into the accounting using the corresponding site's API. If you didn't set it up when you first started, it might have defaulted to the owners or something.

This is mainly as a warning to anyone else using digital ocean as a hosting solution.
As well as a record of how the issue gets resolved.
The support rep I spoke with immediately after receiving this wasn't able to help, but guaranteed they would get back to me. I like digitalocean as a service a lot, but this really threw me off. I may switch because of it. Considering the number of sites I'm running off these I can only hope it gets worked out quick.
In other news, digitalocean is bullish on bitcoin!
EDIT: I was hosting 2 bitcoin / cryptocurrency blogs off one vps.
For now I'm assuming it was related to that, or one of them were compromised somehow.
EDIT 2: They unlocked my account  after I responded to their support ticket on the site (instead of contacting over the phone like I had been), explained, and waited about an hour and a half.  It should be noted that I never made any threats or even pushed to get it resolved immediately until tonight at which point I felt I'd waited long enough. Most of the sites hosted are in development, and not heavily advertised.
Oddly enough all seems well for now, but I'll probably be migrating to a new service. Nothing against digital ocean. I just couldn't risk this happening if any of my sites were to see significant growth.
Edit 3: Final update. Turns out there was a process using up all my resources. It was NOT bitcoin or crypto related, but had to do with another pet project.
Lesson learns. Contact DO through their website, THEN call. Watch your usage regardless of what you're doing or prepare to have to explain yourself at least once.  This was related to a process running, and I feel really stupid for not realizing how much processing power it was using. The process was not bitcoin related. All has been fully restored, and I have moved the instance in question onto another server.
Thank you everyone for helping me rule out stuff, and make sense of how/why they do things.
Digital ocean should really provide some kind of warning/notice for these things. I wasn't cloud mining in this case, but that doesn't mean I never have. I would hate for someone to lose their account over trying it out.

As someone who never really understood the real world application of using bitcoin compared to cash. This experience was an eye opener. We didn't have to meet, and I wasn't paranoid my account might get limited - like my paypal is now, or that he would be a dick and reverse the transaction. I still prefer using it online, but I'm less of a skeptic when it comes to daily use then I was before.
@_date: 2014-02-25 04:39:48

In Europe bitpay is probably the best option. They just have to sign up and register their banking info. You'll get the most info out of looking on the website, but I know the minimum for a direct deposit is 20 EUR. It just trades at whatever the rate is from time of purchase. Pretty simple.

@_date: 2014-03-14 20:19:22
Just bitpay or coinbase &amp; a device to handle transactions on (android preferably of course). Most businesses prefer to have the coin automatically be traded and sent to their bank account. Just note them the usual cheaper 0-1% fee and low risk/ no chargebacks + publicity stuff. Also don't be overly pushy, but offer to help get them set up.
@_date: 2014-04-19 21:31:05

It all got worked out in the end once I contacted them online. (For whatever reason their online support team has been more helpful then their phone)
 The reasoning had to do with a process that was running high, but it wasn't bitcoin related. They just jumped the gun.

If you're selling in person there's no requirement for the coins to be transferred via lb. As a seller on there for 3 years I think I used them 3 times total. Usually directly transferring is easier for everyone. 
For online services I recommend circle. As far as fees go they currently charge none.

WTH. How did you know it was me?

Selling on circle is "withdrawing". 
Like I said. Fees should be 0% on there.
I usually sell on LB for a 5% premium now. 
I don't do it for the money anymore. I did when my premium was 15%. Now I just do it to walk people through the process and answer questions. 
@_date: 2015-03-12 15:03:23
There's a lot of important details. 
What country?
Why not  local Bitcoins?
what volume?
LB is the go to for a lot of reasons. 
Otherwise you're mostly limited to exchange services. Coinbase, buttercoin, or circle for the U.S.  Kraken or bitstamp otherwise. There used to be vault of satoshi, but that just closed last month.

That's what I was talking about. It's not really a premium otherwise.  It's just speculated profits. There's also mycelium I suppose.
