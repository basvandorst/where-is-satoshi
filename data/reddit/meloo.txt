Bitcoin is not just some random investment opportunity to make a quick buck, if you think of it this way, you deserve to loose money as people like you are responsible for Bitcoin struggling in achieving it's goals

thank you for clearing it up

I rather think atm the red arrow is the BTC core community, and the wave are the people who just want to make a quick buck

You mean this:
Quote: "Buyer beware Quote "BCH wallets will require you to import your seed or your private keys, which can be exported from Electrum. Doing so will expose all your Bitcoin funds associated with that seed to the BCH wallet you decide to use. Therefore, after the BCH fork, but before you enter a seed or private key in a BCH wallet, you should move all your funds to a new Electrum wallet, with a new seed. You will still be able to use the old seed or private key with BCH, because BCH has replay protection. Wait until your funds are confirmed in your new Bitcoin wallet, before you enter the old private key in a BCH wallet. This will protect your BTC funds from rogue/untrusted software. "
So, lets see:
1- Wait for fork
2- Move BTC from wallet1 to wallet2
3- Wait for confirmation
4- Import wallet1 keys to BCH wallet and get my BCH coins and stop using wallet1, because they now may have my wallet1 keys, but my coins are safe in wallet2"
Quote End

regarding replay protection issue: if I send bitcoin from my ledger nano s to another adress, will the s2x coin be sent aswell or does the nano ledger s take care of this ?
In other words: DoI need to manually protect by for example tainting or I dont have to do it because ledger does it for me ?
thank you

I would retire on 18 k a year and live in South East Asia, i dont need no fucking car or a big mansion, I just want to enjoy my lifetime. Having a place to sleep, Internet, clean Air, Sun and good friends is enough for me. Atm I am working and I live on 800 USD a month in germany ! Maybe I would do my own online projects, but being forced doing a job you hate, 18 k passive is a very very good alternative. But I think I have another definition of retirement, I lived in Vietnam and Taiwan before and from 18 k you get a hell of a comfortable life

not sure if troll or stupid, if a daytrader checking his prices is addiction then you showing up at work every day is addiction as well, dat logic, ofc it depends on the specific situation dude....
@_date: 2018-03-30 19:20:57
sure, pussy out and support the government power by slaving your life away and support oppression and wars with your taxes, dont need to justify it in this reddit, no fucks given here, but seriously: when I read your post, I read absolute desperation - maybe wanted to get rich quick and invested a bit too much ? :P
@_date: 2018-03-27 02:35:20
nice try pushing the price, will still be in vain, get out now boy before its 2 late :P
@_date: 2017-10-24 22:08:12
same here,I will probably go in at 5200, sold at 5960 when it broke down from 6100, if it rises 200 USD straight without a new 24 h low I buy in at this point
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:57:33
bought at 600, willing to go broke, I diversified ito other cryptos tho, more into platform and protocls nowadays
@_date: 2017-10-21 00:33:05
Hodler here, I took all my money I had at 800 (which was close to nothing) and dumped it all into bitcoin. If it continues rising maybe at some point my life wont be total shit anmyore :D
@_date: 2017-10-30 10:16:54

@_date: 2018-07-15 13:58:46

@_date: 2017-10-21 23:35:45
well said mate

With so many threads popping up about the situation the world is in nowadays and only reading retarded answers and uncomplete answers (some people write about fractional reserve banking only, other only about government bonds given to the central bank and the interest that has to be paid on it, etc etc etc) I was really surprised how much people lacking fundamentally understanding the monetary system and therefore dont even understand the value of bitcoin. So It think these kind of posts are now needed very much.
 Dont get me wrong, I am in for years, but when even after this period of time 99% of posts are shitty price speculation posts even I am taunted to sell. Maybe it really is better when majority of poor people getting erased so the rest can survive. Sharing content like this and generally explaining the fundamental problem with centralisation is now needed again, and not stupid confirmation bias circle jerking and shilling
@_date: 2018-07-15 13:58:16
it is true, and that is also how the EZB works in europe, and since the USD is the main reserve currency cuz of the petro dollar "pact" it affects even oiher countries

At your first comment I thought "ok, there is maybe something to it influencing smart money into shorting", but after this comment I just think you should smoke less weed
@_date: 2018-07-14 13:42:50
as long as the shown arguments can be proven and are documented every education is relevant and therefore good to post, only when stuff is in the video that cant be proven it is dangerous. Because then opponents can target this point, and destroy your credibility and the credibility of the projects you are trying to defend. People who talk stuff to people like "conspiracy theorist" dont even know where the word conspiracy theory is coming from (which is well documented). Otherwise they wouldnt even use it.

well, most of the people that smart getting in btc early are also that smart to not get kids, so there are way less "Dad`s" with 1 BTC
