Nice to see all these sexy new faces. Gentlemen, time to pick your favorite!

You guys forgot to mention **XOtika.TV**.
I view it as a pure "bitcoin-only" adult streaming platform. They recently celebrated 1 year since launch with over 104k viewers, 1000 stream channels and 200 bitcoins in tips.  
You don't need an account to watch shows and if you want to stream you can be online within minutes. I'm surprised no one is talking about this more.

LoL. Is this some sort of Xotika.TV replica? Looks deserted with 0 models online. And the interface is poor. 
But still, my point exactly. Major cam sites have tens and thousands of models. How come they have such poor attraction to Bitcoin?

Honestly i don't see any logic reason why someone would deposit large amounts of btc in a cam site just to withdraw it afterwards. 
Thanks, but no need for warnings, mate. Site is legit. I had some fun over there and folks are great. I only wish more girls would join the Bitcoin revolution.

Makes sense to me. I guess they don't want to become another coin mixer so withdrawals are for performers only.

"Forking" the bitcoin cam industry at such an early age? This is so redditish. 
I'm still in favour of Xotika.TV for now.
In the end I suggest on focusing your efforts into teaching cam models more about bitcoin.

**Xotika.TV** is a pure bitcoin-powered platform, regarding cam sites. Models earn bitcoin and enjoy instant withdrawals, unlike the big players who use a payment processor and sell their bitcoins instantly. 
I suggest supporting the new guys if you want to spread bitcoin adoption.

Well, looks like this platform has bitcoin integrated all over it. 
Now what will it take for models to embrace Bitcoin ?

True. Internet is full of free porn since forever. But this is "on demand" porn. I mean, if you behave nice you can tip the girl to do almost anything. I'm not a cam site conoseur but i kind of understand the growing market for live porn. What buzzez me is how come models world wide don't see the bitcoin potential in all this?
