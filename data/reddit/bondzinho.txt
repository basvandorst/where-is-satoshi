Bitcoin is new. It seems so complicated now. But this will soon be the common knowledge stuff. This will be 101 and taught in High Schools schools within 5-10 years, if not already...

he said $ 20 million to $ 200 million. Not billion. And he's got a point.

I think the assumption that the world is full of 'rational' actors is not the most accurate.

anything will help. 2FA for sure. Trouble is, if they have your password now, they could be setting up 2FA on your account. Be careful. Did you check your recent activity? My account was being accessed from the entire world by everyone. Not pretty. I was sloppy with a lot of things but fortunately by bitcoins are on paper wallets.

voting against bitcoin is soon going to be perceived as another massive vote for big banks and less accountability. i hope the government is aware of that and the ire that could foment.

that doesn't make it a good article. I could write an article about Elvis Presley without mentioning that he sang music, does it make it a good article?

Now if only Coinbase would start selling and trading in Litecoin as well. Come on now, please.

Great to see, and I love it, front page and all. I'd not seen that before. But I'm sorry to break this to you, your 'new'spaper is not so 'new'. The exact same article came out a full two weeks ago, by the same author in the San Jose Mercury News.

perhaps bitcoin is just a ploy created by unemployed web developers! Fiendish!
@_date: 2013-08-31 01:45:23
Genius. Breathtaking. And frankly terrifying. But I don't want to dump all my bitcoins into the trash if no one else does. BTC tip coming when I can figure out how to do it.

Always great to find little misunderstandings. WBN says they are looking for any issues like that to make the next version. So it will help.

Does it require that you download the 8gig block chain?
@_date: 2013-09-07 01:25:30
Not true. NYTime's false statement is shown in the video. Highlighted, legible, and blown up, easy to see, straight from their paper's site. And that's what all the fuss is about. End of story. Its sad that you would come down so hard about something, that it seems clear you misunderstood.
@_date: 2013-09-24 16:58:02
I agree with you. But mom and pops do work on small margins for their profits, often of around 10%. So credit cards (by taking just 3-5%), end up eating 30-50% of profits. So in some cases it could be a huge advantage to a little business.
@_date: 2013-09-06 13:59:31
Great feedback. That was a poorly written line, and I'll work on it. What I meant to say was that you don't have to apply to anyone to use bitcoin, unlike the rigorous protocols of credit cards and even paypal.
@_date: 2013-08-27 05:47:51
This whole argument lacks tons of data and reality. Most brick and mortar shops function on around 10% profits (i.e. 40% rent, 25% labor, 10% materials, and by the time you throw in insurance, miscellaneous stuff, etc, it adds up to 90% quick). So when a credit card company takes 3-6% that's off the top, and can be considered as eating up 30-60% of the profits. There's no one who runs their own restaurants that wouldn't like to ditch Visa and Mastercard TODAY!!! Its the difference between sending your kids to school or not.

Trezor might be good, but is not available yet. Coinbase also seems cool, but it still leaves your personal passwords, etc vulnerable, so while Coinbase holds the bitcoins, someone can send them to themselves as you. Paper wallets are dangerous, but you can make a few of them and put them in safe deposit boxes...usb drives work the same way.
@_date: 2013-08-27 22:37:22
Governments do not regulate currency. They regulate the use of currency. Subtle but important distinction. What is at stake here is a regulation of the exchanges (coinbase for example) and services dealing with bitcoin.

not true. the video clearly claims that the guardian covered it fairly, and shows the exact quote where the new york times did not. it looks more like you're trying to protect something...care to comment?

@_date: 2013-09-26 21:00:37
From the video description "Its time to take a good hard look at those who now hold over half of all the bitcoin wealth. They are a select breed indeed. And is open-source as open as we like to think? Despite the rhetoric of transparency and all-inclusive, it seems clear a good chunk of the world is being left out...again. Is there anything we can do to prevent that?"

why don't we have a BUG FUND for bitcoin. I'd donate.

Now this is an angle that really needs some attention. Well written, and completely new for me (avid bitcoin fan). And yes...even with some truth ringing in the lines. Nice job. If I could upvote twice I would.

Wow! I used to love NYT. That article is embarrassing for everyone. Are there no editors anymore? Are there no fact checkers? ANDREW ROSS SORKIN is the name of the author. Duly noted.

Great video. I posted this, but this one came up with the thumbnails. Nice job WBN!

Its easy to change right now. If you have suggestions let me know.
@_date: 2013-11-27 19:03:44
that's fair i guess. but litecoin really is bitcoin with just a couple changed parameters. And its fate (as the article suggests) helps bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-11-05 18:00:46
This is the second video in wbn's Big Five series. This one looks at the advantages (especially to merchants) of bitcoin vs. credit cards. Nice bit about the history, and how credit cards came about as well.
@_date: 2013-09-30 19:53:42
I agree. If only the general population could understand something about cryptography and the power and simplicity of the SHA256, bitcoin would be fully accepted today.
@_date: 2013-09-05 19:31:32
its on youtube.

Amazing production. It feels like CNN. Their page says they are a new news channel out of boston focused exclusively on bitcoins. Already 8 reports on the site. Nice job.

ebay's nervous about bitcoin because it is signaling an end to paypal...that's billions per year...poof.

anyone can read the documents. not just the new york paper, who by the way is the only one who claimed that BS. Its insulting to cryptographers. What the article basically says is stop doing cryptography...its pointless...that's just not true. not even close. nothing got cracked.

i like coinbase. buy from coinbase. am lazy. but i like to know my balance without unleashing all the madness of being able to spend everything with a click.

Bullllll crappppp!!!! 
This comment (below) on the NY Times article, tears the piece to appropriate little shreds of journalistic ignorance. It just shows how freakin ignorant the world is about cryptography. The author of this great response is, K. Liu. He wrote:
This article is nothing but a mess of generalities.
It mentioned PGP. It never mentioned whether PGP is still secure (it is). As someone with extensive experience in cryptography and security, I want to point out a few things. Nobody, not even the NSA can arbitrarily crack anything. When done correctly, even if the NSA set every computer on the planet to work on brute-forcing an encrypted message, it won't be done in the next million years. If the NSA is able to break into communications, it does so through less magical means, like using a National Security Letter to demand that data be handed over, stealing a key from a user, even having agents who physically pilfer keys and data. While the NYT does make mentions of these alternate methods, it muddies it all up and fails to draw distinctions.
E.g.: the weaknesses in NSA-sanctioned algorithms like AES and SHA that the article alluded to? Yes, those can make brute-force cracking go much faster, but the attacks aren't practical because they will STILL take millions of years (if not much more).
The NSA story is important, and deserves the attention of the public. But the NYT does nobody a favor by presenting an article so fraught with technical ignorance that makes it sound like all encryption is down the drain (they're not) or that no web transactions are private (most still are) and that the sky is falling (nope).
