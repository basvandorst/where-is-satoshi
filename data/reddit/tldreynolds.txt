I believe his word was right for the 1970's. 
Yours appears to be fit more for the 1670's.

No answer from the mods after an hour... I'm deleting this post and re-adding.
This auto-mod bullshit needs to be more intelligent!

I can't imagine how you're even seeing this, because the post appears taken down from my POV. But here's the relevant part again:
After writing a particularly B[censired]cash-slanted article about Slush's AsicBoost news over the weekend, Bitcoin dot com writer Jamie Redmond got called out by Bitcoin Magazine's writer Aaron van Wirdum on Twitter:
After Aaron called Jamie's source "misinformed noise," Jamie took it as an insult and exited the argument quickly, only to pick up the conversation as a sockpuppet called 'Jonathan Herringbone.'
During that parlance, Jamie then forgot to switch his account back to Herringbone's for one response, and answered as himself, talking about himself in the third person to continue the argument:
To make matters worse, Jamie then deleted his post, but not before the Internet Archive took a snapshot of it:
Jamie then Blocked Aaron, and followed up on the thread by claiming that he is under attack, and that Aaron is fabricating evidence against him:
This is Roger's Senior writer at his newsdesk, clearly an employee. If Roger wants to keep claiming he never employs sockpuppets, he'd now have to fire Jamie.

Lol... If they'd have tried this with a reasonable amount I might have felt a tiny bit concerned...

Op didn't delete anything... I got automodded for saying bee-cash.
