No look at my other comment about blockchain.info

Blockchain,info is usually used on the online GUI. Check every email you could have used

Dear PineappleFund,
I have submitted a proposal on behalf of our 501(c) non-profit organization, Caribbean and TenneSEA. I hope that you will find our mission, activities, goals (completed and aspiring) to be noble and worthy of a donation to assist in the difficulty of operating a non-profit in conservation and environmental remediation.
Warmest regards,

Are you still reviewing submissions on the website? I'm worried that there have been many and our water project isn't being seen.

If you downloaded a wallet and can't find wallet.dat or a .json file then you're out of luck

The post isn't authoritarian because what he is suggesting is a proof of stake mechanism to buttress the collective goal of harboring a forum on which verifiable and conducive conversation is  facilitated. I for one agree with the notion because we have well to many people posting inaccurate assessments and otherwise making comments that mislead others into making skewed economical decisions. Of course it is at any individual's risk to make a decision ultimately, however preventing false information on or forum is something that the mods and bots could be aided with if such a proof of stake mechanism was democratically voted in. This does not constitute authoritarianism in any manner at all.
Again, it's not about what is agreeable, it is what is proven as fact, or aligns with academic models.
Objectivity &gt; subjectivity

Just keep in mind the circulating supply differences between XRP and BTC, don't expect to see XRP &gt;$5

Once you've signed a transaction there is nothing you can do.

Pine, I have filled out the application for Caribbean and TenneSEA in Chattanooga, TN. My executive director has taken wind of the Pineapple Fund. She may fill out the application, I hope that with her application you will consider our nonprofit. Thanks!

Just use an encrypted flash drive. Have a spare somewhere safe. store your seed physically. Exact same thing.

You're in the wrong, learn from this mistake and wait to trade currency until you're older or get a mentor / sponsor. You committed a crime

Go to blockchain.info and look for the wallet login and say you forgot your wallet identifier. You should be able to send your email address a confirmation of your identifier and then you can log in. This assumes you utilized blockchain.info

Thank you so much!!! I am looking forward to potentially hearing from you!!!
Warmest regards,

You probably didn't use the specified email for the wallet then

I don't understand the trolling on this post. Have you not read the fucking white paper? The entire purpose of BTC is to be used as currency. Of course it is not operating as it should because of deflation and a slow network, however, that was the purpose. At least he is using the coin to buy something. You're probably "hodling" some insignificant amount of BTC that will yield no real return. Troll!

If you can't perform a child-pays-for-parent subsequent transaction of a minimal value with a high fee (replacement) then you must wait t+14 days for the network to drop your transaction.

Can you expound further on the last component of your comment. Where could I find more information regarding exemption from capital gains on the basis of income?
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:29:58
Are you considering the Caribbean and TenneSEA? The application has been submitted but this would help so much. Please let me know. This is an additional water project.
