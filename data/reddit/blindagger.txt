Then you should consider those who enable and sustain the siphoning of wealth from the poor to the rich to be thieves and therefore, bad people.

They may be alarmist but that doesn't mean it isn't getting worse. Further increases in inequality will breed increased social unrest.

Getting rid of currency seems far from possible as of now. The entire world has bought into the idea of capitalism, even as it funnels the wealth of the poor to the rich and keeps them subservient through debt. Bitcoin is not a debt based currency. Bitcoin allows the unbanked to participate in an economy that is founded in an ideal money that is not debased to the benefit of a few. 
When people join the ecosystem, Bitcoin the network increases in value, and all users receive the benefits instead of just those closest to the printing presses. I don't see any banks rushing to get people in developing countries access to financial services, but they can join the bitcoin ecosystem without having to ask for permission from anyone. 
Granted, it is far from ready for mainstream acceptance with all the controversy over the block size and the limitations on transactions per second, but I don't see why people of the world should wait to see when the current financial system will help them, because it won't.

Global remittance is a legitimate use case that can be as small or as large as the user would like. The fees are orders of magnitude smaller than third party middlemen.

Vice did a good episode this season on the rise of conservative radical militias in America, there has been staggering growth in the past few years. Events such as the Bundy Ranch debacle have emboldened them, since the authorities were the ones to back down.
edit: Watching the 2nd link below I found myself experiencing some cognitive dissonance... they are misguided yet there are a few kernels of truth behind their ideas. The writer in particular seems to understand what is happening.
@_date: 2015-06-03 21:15:05
The full coverage is on Vice on HBO, S3E3. This is what I could find that gives an overview on the issue.
@_date: 2015-06-06 19:37:34


But we have seen Bitcoin tends to grow in orders of magnitude, and you are explaining a flat line of increase. If multiple national currencies are being inflated and dumped into Bitcoin, it would take far less time.

Wouldn't an example of that be buying bitcoin after the pizza incident in 2010?

Wait but aren't you saying that 9/11 could be a conspiracy until revealed to be true? We find out decades later so that it matters little due to those who were there now dead or in old age. And yeah, as stated below, since we know the CIA did in fact do this to inner-city black populations, it seems anything is fair game. That verified occurrence is much worse than the Tuskagee experiment or the current DPR situation.

Yes but he's saying they can't utilize it effectively do to the vast majority of Grecians being unable to utilize internetworked computer technology on a general level. They don't have the critical mass of infrastructure and experience working with computers.

But if you live another 25 years or so, the global money supply would be over $150 trillion just with a steady 3% inflation year over year.

Fantastic so that gives us 55,800,000 +/- 12,400,000 people likely to buy bitcoin in the future. How many wallets are there now, upwards of 2 million?

For a few more years. Eh you got me.
That is interesting though the yearly drug trade in dollars is over 60 times Bitcoin's current size. Makes it easy to laugh when people say it will be used for drugs when there is already something ubiquitous for that.

Except it is fractional reserve banking so that 100,000,000 turns into $1,000,000,000 since they hand $100,000,000 out to the first buyer, hold $10,000,000 as reserve, lend out the other $90,000,000, hold $9,000,000 as reserve, lend out the other $81,000,000... you get the idea.

He was stating this before the dawn of the ASICs, though he probably should already considered their rise. Back then though it was possible to meaningfully contribute just with spare CPU cycles. So perhaps he knew that the price would have to grow many times over in order to approach the network size where economies of scale for ASICs would start to make sense to develop.

I think he means the layman version. I was wondering, is the TPP supposedly meant to be a "free trade" (technical meaning) deal as well? Because from anything I have seen about it, it seems like a tool to oppress.

I think you just said they really do $100 million dollars worth of work in a year. That could be 2500 people making $40k a year, which would help the economy much more.

But yet our entire economic system is coercive to put the poor to work for scraps to keep the party running for the privileged few on top. The fact that his largest issue on his platform is rising income inequality is no surprise. This trend cannot go on forever, it is unsustainable and will lead to economic collapse due to insufficient purchasing power of the "bottom 90%" (which is an absurd term we have to use to understand the scale of the problem).
@_date: 2015-09-11 22:00:09
Isn't it impossible to spend less when our economic system requires yearly inflation of new US dollars entering the system (Perma QE), that have to be spent somewhere by the government after being received from the private Federal Reserve?

What would you describe the current status quo of late capitalism where only the rich are benefitting from soaring productivity and absorbing nearly all economic growth as other than "stealing from people"?

Because of deflation during the Great Depression.
@_date: 2015-03-11 18:57:07
But why do you think QE4 will do it and not QE8,9, or 10? I don't really see why everyone will lose faith since keeping the face on is how it keeps going, right? Couldn't they just say they are responding to the same being done by the ECB currently?

I've heard of many situations where people were investigated with further scrutiny after having a few days to months of payments adding up to over $10,000 involved in their bank accounts. I think the term they use is "structuring" which is a weird way of saying you are guilty until proven innocent.

Every year there is growth in this sub and growth through news / word of mouth by current users. Exponential growth dictates that this accelerates as more people become exposed in these various ways. Five years ago maybe 1000 people joined, but last year probably more than 100,000 joined.

He's referring to it's origins as ARPANET for the US Military so it is factually true. Though he's a troll, it checks out.
@_date: 2015-02-09 17:38:50
This is true but the rate of inflation (that is decreasing) has been and looks to continue to be outperformed by percentage gain in user adoption. Exponential growth vs depreciating inflation.
