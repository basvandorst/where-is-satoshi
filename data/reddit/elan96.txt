Europe has kinda the opposite of the US system. Instead of needing a license for all 50 states, you get a license in any EU/EEA country, and it is valid for all of the EU.

I'm assuming English isn't their first language, but you still receive the license at the national level, but you can exercise it internationally.

Actually that's not the case. SW reduces the need for speed as the transactions have been broadcast procedurally beforehand, whereas for latency reasons blocks are sent in one large block which needs to be transferred rapidly to prevent orphans.

SEPA transfers are only reversible at the discretion of the receiving bank, who have no obligations to reverse transfers if the sending bank claims their user was defrauded. Generally this is because they have some time to catch any fraud before it is sent.

Facebook US doesn't hide in Irish tax laws, that's not how those loopholes work.
Anyway, at what point does tax become immoral? When you have less than half of your earnings belonging to you or when the government has all of it?
Personally I don't feel like the country I was born in should have any divine claim over the fruits of my labour. It certainly wasn't a place I chose to be born?
You're also neglecting that it is capitalists that make successful nations. There is a reason China is growing, America has been the world's largest economy, and Venezuela has no toilet paper. The Greek people should be thanking their lucky businessmen and encouraging more to come.

Exactly. Same reason why saying bitcoin should replace Paypal is derpy. No, it shouldn't. It can't. What it can do is provide an immutable layer with a fixed currency supply, which doesn't give a fuck about your politics. Your paypal replacement that has the ability to skirt regulations, and operate efficiently can be built on top of this and have varying levels of centralization. 
The idea that everything needs to be on the blockchain is braindamaged.

No, it's a Philippines capital control. I don't know how you don't understand this. No foreign entities can hold PHP, there is a reason why there are no banks outside of the Philippines that allow PHP current accounts (exception being a couple of Australian banks, but you must be a Filipino to open them).
If I want an account in PHP, I would need to open a Filipino company, if I wanted to hold Thai Baht I would need a Thai company. 
If I want to hold USD, EUR, GBP, PLN, NZD, etc etc there are many banks all over the world from the UK to Australia that will allow me to do this.

BlockStream, CoinBase, MIT. Between them I think there are 8 developers on payroll.


They don't need to hold the money, and if anyone wants to do something worthwhile (anonymity etc) they can raise the money themselves. Multi-sig is a thing without needing a complex system like lighthouse.

No, the way it works is:
Facebook is a company in the US.
Facebook UK LTD is a wholly owned subsidiary of Facebook US
Facebook IP Inc is a wholly owned subsidiary of Facebook US in the Cayman Islands.
Now, if they make revenue with Facebook UK LTD they will have to pay tax multiple times, so rather than doing that, they rent IP from Facebook Cayman Islands, which then distributes the money to Facebook US, meaning they only have taxes to pay in the US on the funds.
It is not possible to issue a dividend from a company without paying tax.

It's not really something you could provide a source on..
Essentially segregated witness carries only the signatures in the block itself, rather than the transaction data which is stored locally.
Now, the block itself needs to move quickly - anyone who says "blocks can be 1gb because the average connection can shift 2gb over 10 minutes [numbers may be made up]" is wrong because that means from the point of the block being produced, it would take a considerable amount of time for the block to propogate which is what causes conflicts (and therefore orphans).
The transactions that are going to be included in the next block are obviously being constantly streamed as people make them, so are already transferred over the ten minute period, meaning they don't need to fit within a few second burst period.
Hope this makes sense, eli5 has never been my strong point.

Partially correct, that was the original goal but it was open ended about what it could be used for


Developers are already funded, and anything not done by the core devs (i.e privacy centric wallets) can be done by themselves. If it's worth doing it doesn't necessarily need a central repo.


No you don't, that's their job.




None of it needs to be decentralized. If the operator of it starts censoring things, someone can create another. See etc.
It does nothing that a centralized one couldn't do more efficiently, and it doesn't have the team behind it to market it and make people use it. It's basically just a load of shit.

Precisely, I actually predict that all of this could happen in a very short period because greed.
Once we get to a level of significance, with continued growth every financial institution that does not use bitcoin will be left for those that do. Everyone will jump over each other at the chance of getting some and be pushing up the price further.
Essentially I believe the greed of everyone will be our success. It is far easier to get people to buy because of greed and then show them why it is good, than it is to do the reverse.

The malleability was only an issue to one exchange before someone started doing it to every single transaction they saw. This is what is causing the problem. It was fine when a few people did it as QT could keep up, but now its just crazy.

Hi bob, if you want to know more about this feel free to get in contact with me - I may be able to offer a lot of free advice.Anyhow, if you're in Luxembourg or France an exchange comes under the payment institution regulations, if you're in Germany it comes under something which I forget the name of (essentially running a commodities exchange). Other than that there are 0 regs currently.Edit:In Germany its MiFID - hence why Kraken/bitcoin.de are agents of Fidor. You're considered to run a multi-lateral trading system.

They have on average lets say 10GH (obviously it is far, far bigger than this.)  
  
They provide 7GH for sale on CEX, 5GH of which is their own hashing power.  
  
They sell this for 0.04 BTC but by all estimates, it will only ever mine 0.02BTC.  
  
They can pay out the miners pretending to be giving them block rewards, but they keep 0.02BTC and end up paying out a total of 0.04.  
  
Worth noting, I cannot *prove* this, but I am fairly certain this is what they do.

True, I think the wrong thing to happen because of this is to have any one exchange rise to power, for example if bitstamp suddenly doubled its size.

I put 'For bitstamp.net only' in giant red letters.
@_date: 2014-05-25 11:22:50
Yeah, I could bang out that code in a couple of hours for your website. Not with Doge and Litecoin, but with bitcoin. If you want to do Doge and Litecoin I guess its possible but I don't have the experience to make it easy.

Yes. Someone at a uni mined doge, now not allowed to use computer systems.
@_date: 2014-05-25 19:41:59
No, acquiring it is enough. Your miners don't know what they are doing, they are just hashing for values.

Purely speculation. No reports of others trying to use this for financial gain so its the only story that makes sense.
@_date: 2014-03-11 13:38:11
It should be confirmed within 10 minutes...

Bitcoin is money, and is checked far more thoroughly than a highly complex project like openSSL.  
  
@_date: 2014-01-21 16:53:30
They do effectively play with others money and they do sometimes lose it. And yes the regulation is there but that doesn't mean they follow it
@_date: 2014-03-04 10:26:42
Some people are going to be confused when the price crashes to 1% when it actually launches.
@_date: 2014-06-12 14:51:35
Wasn't that managed by Davout, who then suddenly had the money to launch Bitcoin-central.  
  
EDIT: stray 'e'
@_date: 2014-03-04 07:45:59
Its not really a company, more two very trusted members of it. One of them is Slush (of slushs pool) who invented the stratum protocol. Its not something everyone needs tomorrow or we lose money its just a revolution in secure wallets. Yes, there are delays. But with this type of project quality is far more important than getting it here tomorrow.

Hidden currency conversion fees.

Bitcoin is to be left to the adults
@_date: 2014-02-28 20:52:21
With exception of precious metals, name a currency that's lasted more than a few hundred years. I think the British pound is one of the oldest
@_date: 2014-12-01 08:56:28
Its also arguable as to whether or not you ever 'import' Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-04-24 20:36:30
And there you have the reason no one would use it.
@_date: 2014-06-20 18:52:56
A mixture.Although, supply and demand is a very low level concept. A gifted toddler could grasp it.
@_date: 2014-04-16 18:49:51
Obviously there is more reasoning behind it, I just didn't write it all out. 
@_date: 2014-04-23 15:38:41
You're not really a bot. Your owner is just a bitcoiner.
@_date: 2014-05-22 02:30:17
Can't see any reason why you would have to

But it was stored on a Trezor Bruce!

Probably will do soon though. Its a good idea!
@_date: 2014-02-19 16:24:28
And no I am not a marketer, I am setting up a casino and was looking for a VPS. They were the best I could find that accept BTC (tortoiselabs is cheaper but 20mb/s connection isn't enough)
@_date: 2014-06-23 09:00:43
You're not wrong, you're just an asshole.
@_date: 2014-03-30 17:44:29
Probably not worth pissing off another bank just to clamp down on Bitcoin, you can say the same thing about the US
@_date: 2014-04-16 19:48:08
Even for medium large ones it is acceptable. Once a transaction has propagated, unless the buyer is/controls/is friends with a pool it may as well be confirmed.
@_date: 2014-04-16 18:47:48
How transactions propagate on the network. Every situation you described in reality relies on the person who sends the TX working with a pool owner.
@_date: 2014-04-17 02:23:50
Because when they hand the proof of ID over to someone it says in big red letters 'for bitstamp.net only' (among other things) and they won't accept it.
@_date: 2014-02-12 17:50:54
They can only perform 0 confirmation double spends though. So not really a big issue just wait for 1 conf.
@_date: 2014-12-17 23:07:12
What I find funnier is how they are trying to apply regulations to the entire world. That's not how jurisdiction works.
@_date: 2014-06-16 12:45:14
Seems to be the main thing, that and size, as well as design
@_date: 2014-03-24 15:03:39
BTC-e has slow support, you will have to wait a little while but they have a good rep for sorting things out in the end.

@_date: 2014-04-16 10:05:41
I was thinking that its more going to be bitundo being implemented in existing pools rather than them having their own pool.  
  
Because p2pool can't have their software implemented it would stop this surely?

Works out favourably for us though.
@_date: 2014-04-16 16:28:07
No you don't need confirmations, clients that have already received the first transaction will not accept the second so it will not spread over the network or be confirmed.
@_date: 2014-04-23 18:49:54
Essentially the freemarket would actually sort out war, I can understand the concept here. Very interesting.
@_date: 2014-03-18 00:12:12
Even more notably, I have been in chats with the FCA and neither my own nor Neo's business model requires authorization. That means you can set up a Neo and Bee branch just as easily as a butchers shop.
@_date: 2014-04-16 18:46:43
Its not even that, once it has propagated unless they have pool operators in on it, they are already sorted.

Yes, for laundering large amounts of drug money. They operate with numerous banks in various territory's which most likely hold very little US$. Third parties will hold most of it (Perfect Money, OKpay). They'll probably take their profit in BTC or cash.

Have a few domains ready, but marketing isn't our priority until we have everything we need in order. 
The bank accounts are already labelled for use in financial businesses, its relatively no questions asked. Although thats not what we want to use regardless. 
We are based in the UK, and we comply with UK laws above and beyond, and to an extent EU laws (KYC, AML. So basic compliance). Prison time isn't really a major concern as its unlikely and quite frankly worse things have happened, we're keeping some reserves available in the EU accounts in case of worst case scenario so that we could pay anyone off worst case (I mean our customers, not law enforcement).
@_date: 2014-05-07 06:16:47
But where do we shift the blame...?

Heating is literally inefficient in its nature.   
  
The vast majority of the energy you put into any electronics comes out as heat, same story for any other heater. But by using an ASIC you get (some) of your money back.

An ASIC, its only really profitable if you have a 7/8 digit sum of money. Mining is now either a) a hobby (and like any hobby will cost money) or b) a business.Many people mine for fun, but if you want bitcoins you're better off buying them. Where do you live? (I'll advise an exchange)

Sure, mainly would be first hand experience. However the FCA is generally one of the better regulatory authorities, with very modern reporting systems and low fees for registration.
At the moment you don't even need to register for an exchange, no regulations actually apply.
However, they are working on 'project innovate'^^[Innovate]( which will be creating regulations for innovative businesses that are not even legal in the US.
We're talking about crowdfunded business equity sales^^[CrowdCube]( we're talking peer to peer loans and we're talking bitcoin. You're probably thinking that this means prospective exchanges are going to need millions in bonds, and still have to get it for every other country however thats not the case.
If you want to start a payment service company, the fee is £100 and you need a varying amount of 'reserve capital' available to protect customers, although you don't have to give that to them either - you just have to prove you have it (or one of your shareholders has it, and can pledge it if needed). It is normally 25,000 euros but is maximum 125,000 euros. (Yes, euros not sterling. Its based on EU regulations)
The highest fee other than banks is for an investment firm, that sits at £12,000.
Even better than that, you can 'passport' your authorization to the entirety of the EEU, as well as a few other countries like Switerland.
What I imagine happening, would be exchanges need to register in a similar way to payment institutions, with similar fees (although no reserve capital) and are legally required to collect information and do adequate reporting. And thats if they even decide to regulate it, which they may not.
Full disclosure, I am starting an exchange in the UK
EDIT 2:
CrowdCube, also worth noting, that this isn't crowdfunding like angel.co or crowdfunder.com. This is actually open to non-accredited investors.
@_date: 2014-12-07 19:35:20
Obviously whether or not it will be cheaper depends on what exchanges/services are available his end.
@_date: 2014-04-10 14:57:15
How much do you want to wager on that?
@_date: 2014-12-31 16:40:41
You can do it at your traditional broker and have tax benefits through things like a 401(k)/ira whatever

It's not a major problem unless a large miner is doing it. (Which is M.A.D), we have no real evidence here I just thought it was interesting.

No, screw MtGox. They did us a favor in the beginning but they are not prepared for what Bitcoin is today.
The responsible way to deal with this would have been to have gone down for maintenance and have discussed this issue behind closed doors with the devs who could have then made a fix.

But they're still not tiny, and a large amount of the world (especially eastern europe) is really 'fuck America' in many ways. The bank would have given them up by now if this was how they were to do it.
And it cuts them off temporarily, until the next account opens. You have no idea how easy it is to open up no questions asked multiple currency accounts in Europe.
@_date: 2014-01-11 02:59:18
The big ones are that a company just released a bitcoin storage service that is insured (underwritten by lloyds) that is UK based and that HMRC said we don't have to pay VAT to buy BTC

I suggested that it uses random agents for trades, using a web of trust.
So lets say I have a lot of good reputation, so does person b, c, d and e.
Person F and G want to make a trade, me, c and d are randomly selected to act as agents on this using a n of n key. This prevents one person from constantly posting requests until they get their 'alt' account for a trade and running off with the BTC and the money.

Yes, but drugs are addictive substances, not money. Money's utility is transfer of wealth/storage of wealth.
And it will NOT be useful for criminal proceeds if there is no mainstream market as it would not have the liquidity or the value to hold any real value in comparison to crime proceeds.

You do realize we still have btc-e, right?
@_date: 2014-03-08 15:30:19
When you spend coins, you really just split up previous inputs and move them to somewhere else,  and then send the remainder back to an address you control (change address normally).
Sending the remainder to yourself is done in the same transaction, and treated like any other.
So lets say you have 180,000 btc. 
I withdraw 1btc, and you now have to wait for that to confirm to send the 179,999 btc anywhere else. 
Thats the basics of how it works.
But of course if you have 180,000 singular bitcoins, you can send from multiple addresses at once for any big transactions and you don't have to wait for confirmations because you already have more coins ready to go.

He's sort of right, but to a very small degree. There have been examples where this is the case, and many exchanges do think that compliance ends at a passport, however I can say that there is a big four bank in talks with a Bitcoin only business. A good example that proves that these banks are not just doing it for compliance reasons, is the Jersey fund being cut off by HSBC.

Just to give a better explanation as to why pooled mining is good for decentralisation, it lowers the barrier of entry significantly meaning for consistent pay out you don't need hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of hardware.   
  
You can easily move pool if it gets too big, but if one miner is too big... you have a problem.

You have to consider that in order for the government to perform this attack they have two choices.
1) They buy chips/boards from the already established vendors. And this would be BULK, more than an entire KNC series, would not be possible to go to just one vendor.
What does KNC do? They would find out whos ordered this amount, or even if they do not know exactly who it is they will report it to the community - they know the risk of a 51% as much as anyone and their entire business model would be screwed over by it.
Everyone then knows what is happening, and other companies ramp up production, every Tom and Harry buys a small rig for the blockchain to keep running, if they hold more than a couple of BTC that is.
2) Fabricate a large quantity of chips themselves.
Chip fabrication is an incredibly complex business that requires many very skilled workers.
While the government could place an American company under a gag order if they wanted to subcontract them, they have no legal obligation to accept the contract. Although they most likely will, Bitcoin is not of their concern. The potential for a leak is beyond huge - we get leaks on next gen intel chips. It will most likely be noticed and have the same outcome.
Lets assume that it does not happen, there is no leak, and the government has managed to achieve 51%.
How long will that last?
Not very long at all. Chip producers ramp up production, every Tom and Harry buys a small rig and it ends up being a sinkhole for all involved. The Government has successfully sunk literally tens of billions (by the time they have designed their own chips, and produced the boards who knows what the hashrate will be) into a project that may last a matter of days.
And you may think, KNC etc will not bother ramping up production that quickly!
Yes, they will. They have invested millions into data-centers, and their technology. They clearly hope to be one of the biggest companies of the next 10 years and they cannot afford for this to be screwed up.
I'm not saying there aren't ways for the Government to attack Bitcoin, but attempting a 51% is the worst way of doing it.

Hey, just thought I would add that Mimex actually has two UK banking arrangements at three different banks, and a third coming in two and a half months.One of our banking partners is our investor, so we have a good financial incentive thereWe've also done a lot different to how people gained access previously, I'll dig up a post for you edit: Done&gt;Well for starters we actually have two (third pending) providers, we only offer one at the moment but the other is our investor. &gt;Second, HSBC was the one that closed CTS's bank account, and Mardica is with a different bank, our investor is also with two completely different banks. &gt;Third, we deal exclusively with our partners, whereas CTS took on 3/4/5 exchanges very rapidly, and I suspect they were outside of their usual risk schedule. &gt;And finally (and most importantly) whereas Coinfloor was doing KYC/AML for their clients, we leave that to our banking partners. Our clients open accounts with them in their usual processes, and transfer funds internally to us - just like they have already been approved of doing. &gt;EDIT: &gt;And all banks involved have their own Faster Payments memberships

I should probably give a better explanation as to why I think its fine.  
  
First, SoFort says it doesn't (and I will assume it doesn't) store passwords. So using SoFort you only have to trust two things. The initial payment is the correct one, and they are not storing your password. In this case its no more of a risk than entering your banking details into your online bank.  
  
Second, in many cases the details you give them will soon be useful once only anyway. For example with my bank we have to sign each transaction (including amount and account number) using a debit card reader. So even the above isn't true.  
  
TL;DR if you're with a decentish bank, the details aren't going to be useful for theft anyway, and the user is a far weaker link than sofort.

The limit is £100,000  
  
The difference between CHAPS and Faster Payments, is that CHAPS is actually individually cleared through bank of England payment accounts at the end of the day, so you know for a fact that once its gone through the complete balance has been cleared between banks. Whereas with Faster Payments the network keeps a ledger of what is owed to each other, and it is cleared irregularly. This means theoretically if I sold my house to someone at HSBC and they send a faster payment, HSBC could go bust later in the day and I wouldn't have my money.  
  
I can't remember what is the difference with BACS transfers, I think I would be correct in saying its just pre-faster payments and the only benefit it has now is you can transfer over £100,000 with very little/no fee (for some business accounts you get charged less for BACS than Faster Payments) that should clear at the end of the day rather than within a couple like CHAPS (which typically costs £20).

I think you need to re-read it.  
  
Buying hashing at CEX has *never* been profitable. Because of this, when they sell the mining they are taking in more money than it will ever mine. They can redistribute the money they take as rewards, as if they are being gained from actual mining and keep the difference for themselves.

It is essentially a pay to put in a TX system. The TX you put in can be a 'double spend' For this to be reliable to even a small degree they either need a) the majority of pool owners to accept it or b) have their own pool large enough that they get almost all blocks.  
  
Why would a pool owner accept this? They might get an extra 0.01 btc per block but their coins will sure as hell lose a lot of value.

All of the things he just did are completely detectable. 
So if he does something that explicitly gets rid of certain pools from being able to process it, it can be detected. Not only that but they can detect the second TX

1) Your fee has nothing to do with that, you could attach a $10,000 fee and you would still have exactly the same issue.  
  
2) You don't need confirmations, as soon as it is propagated it is complete. This takes a matter of seconds. There is a reason bitpay and coinbase don't require confirmations.  
  
By propagation, what I really meant is the pool already mined the block and either 1) They're finishing it off and propagating it or 2) I have not yet seen the block, but its already been done.

Have you seen the specs for the KNC titan? 250mh, is the size of a Neptune and will most likely use around 1kw.  
  
Lets compare GPUs.  
  
Best GPU outputs 1.4m/h on average, so you need 178 of them.  You can put 4 of them in each machine. That's 44 rigs.  
  
Each one of those rigs uses 1.5kw, so you need to be able to supply 70kw of power to them.   
  
So no, the difference is essentially the same, using a GPU on script will be as pointless as a block eruption is now... except far more expensive.    
  
Not to mention each one of those rigs costs $2500 (1/4 of the price of a titan) so your total cost is 110k, not 10k like the titan.
  
I didn't even take into account the amount of space you will need for all of those, and the heat they produce (you'll probably need another 10kw or central heating to prevent a fire).

I don't think you understand how bitcoin works.
@_date: 2014-06-12 23:18:07
No, Satoshi predicted this.
Plus, without pools we would have more centralization. 
Lets say you're John Doe. You want to buy a bitcoin mining machine, now you go out and buy yourself $5,000 worth of hardware.
What is the chance of you receiving a single payout? ~25%.
So that means the minimum anyone can buy to have a almost guaranteed chance of finding a block is around $100,000. And even then you can get unlucky.
For consistency, you need a substantial amount of hashing power. Petahashes, really.
See where I'm going with this?
EDIT: This also neglects to mention that you can't make people change hardware, but people can change pools.

Thank you, I wouldn't be able to do this without the rest of my team. And I am aware of the risks and those are ones I am willing to take and trying to mitigate.

Not sure what sort of Zoos you've been visiting, but almost always they are incredibly humane.  
  
Animals aren't left in the heat without food or water for extended periods.  
  
If other animals attack them it is broken up very quickly.  
  
If injured they are not left out to die slowly and be eaten while alive by vultures.  
  
Full vetinary care.  
  
Not to mention, if you put an animal from a zoo back in the wild it would most likely die within months at best.

Yeah, I'm not pro-state. I'm among the madder libertarian/capitalist anarchist people here. An exchange however is a genuinely very useful service, that makes it just as easy to make a $1m purchase as it is to make a $10 purchase.    
  
They will not go away, I'm not saying report everything you do to your tax agencies or anything. But I think you are quite frankly a moron if you thing cash deals can handle the liquidity required. Imagine making a $100,000 cash buy? It would be like setting up a large drug deal!

When it comes to money laundering it doesn't make a huge amount of difference - I don't think OP was suggesting that the mechanism for 'cashing out' these cards was to get a merchant account and buy produce from yourself.
A more realistic way would be through resale of cards and using the cards to purchase the produce you need, removing a large amount of the paper trail.
Even worse than the prepaid mastercards, is the refillable mastercards issued by Polish banks which you can refill via wire (SEPA IIRC) that require no verification and have bank accounts tied to them. They have low-ish maximum balances (~$3000 equivalent) but they're incredibly cheap to order in bulk.

@_date: 2014-03-24 16:11:19
We have someone else doing the majority of the work on the trading engine, and they are experts. I will not claim to be able to create a high quality engine by myself as I cannot, neither could our lead devs do it on their own.
And considering the current options are wiring/sending SEPA transfers we really are in a good position.
Its very easy for myself to seem unprofessional over Reddit, but when more details are released I think you will see otherwise.
@_date: 2015-01-03 19:51:40
We should create a list of companies who won't comply with BitLicense, mine will certainly be on it.
@_date: 2015-01-05 02:26:06
Your example would still rely on entirely centralised service.
And you're right, there can be multiple payment systems but there will be one dominant system, for example VISA
@_date: 2015-01-14 21:19:12
Yes we do, because it most likely wasn't an account for one person. To reiterate we have one account which we use for all of these customers that fit into the category. The lack of the $ I think it most likely due to outright theft by staff internally, not Willy.
So for example with all other users there is a log of all deposits/withdrawals they make, these accounts just have balances. (On ours we actually log some more things separately, but there was certainly negligence at MtGox)
@_date: 2015-01-18 13:34:29
I think so, the regulations have stopped viable alternatives. Had their been a viable alternative led by more reputable people (i.e TradeHill) that people would have used Gox? No. 
@_date: 2015-01-15 18:08:01
Well then they can look at a two year chart..

SEPA is worse than wire transfers in most cases, as you get £15 + 2.5% conversion fees.

You're sort of right, in the sense that you wouldn't want to run it on your mobile but considering the current price of a connection that can handle that swimmingly in Western Europe it only needs to become about 4x more cost effective for it to be fine for home connections.

Because its not a bitcoin company, so he raises no valid point. They provided services to a number of bitcoin services but thats not what their roots are.
I have no respect for someone who dedicates a good chunk of their time for shitting on something unless they are getting paid to do it.
Because, once again it isn't a bitcoin company. It never was a bitcoin company. It never will be a bitcoin company. It was a traditional payments company that worked with a number of bitcoin companies *and many other types of companies like forex, porn, etc that struggle to get banking*

Sure, and if the regulation wasn't in the way there would have been non-shady alternatives.

No, you're thinking of Willy and his friend. Most likely accounts for large purchasers - we have one of them at our exchange for people who want us to deal with buying coins. We never register the transactions that deposit into the account because they deal directly with myself, so it would appear that they are getting instant free money.  
  
Regardless, if that was the case (like some trolls try and push) it would make Bitcoin massively undervalued, not overvalued, because creating Bitcoin to sell obviously isn't going to increase the price.

 Unfortunately its not that simple, we would rather do it but we cannot.   
  
For example, if we don't hold enough keys to initiate the transaction ourselves, we've just turned every trading user into a counterparty - one of the main things an exchange is meant to stop.

We have something similar, we have a couple of people who pay us 1% to buy them large chunks of bitcoin for them. No where near as much info tied to that account as the others (there is also two of them, a buyer and a seller - because we don't allow you to trade with yourself).

Automatically recurring payments is a feature that can be added to services like coinbase.
So you can deposit lets say 0.2 bitcoins into coinbase, and then go onto github.

Corporations are essentially only persons in that they can take on their own contracts, debts, and assets. They are a typically somewhat democratically led body that has the ability to perform actions on its own behalf.
They cannot vote, they cannot claim unemployment benefits. The personhood is a necessary step to separate the owners/directors from the business - of course needed for the protection of both the owners/directors and the company. It means if my company goes tits up my assets cannot be seized, and that if one of the other shareholders goes bankrupt the company assets cannot be seized - the company owns it's debt, I own my debt, I own my assets, it owns it's assets.

Not sure how to prove that, but in most countries you don't require licensing for buying/selling bitcoin, transferring bitcoin, storing dollar amounts as bitcoin, etc. So by storing USD as "bitcoin" (lol, in their systems it probably doesn't even work like that) you avoid the laws that would regulate it otherwise.

Though I still am not sure that you understand what a bank is - I can operate a service exactly like yours, except that people wire money to our accounts on their own IBAN numbers, we allow them to transact with anyone inside or out of the system, and its still not a bank. Banks take deposits, and issue credit and securities (i.e Certificates of deposit, bonds, etc). Also in most countries banks are required to release (quarterly?) balance sheets which if you know what you're looking for a fairly easy to read and to understand the overall health of the bank.
Nice company overall though, I would personally have some changes I would make to your product and marketing if it were me, which would massively boost your utility as a payment provider without increasing any regulatory burden but that's just me.

Care to throw in any-more buzzwords?
There are only two ways to remain solvent without having one person willing to accept you wholly as a counterparty and absorb all the risk (who must themselves have substantial liquidity) and they are:
- selling the coins
- futures contracts
Assiuming you went with a) selling the coins, you would be holding $/£/XAU in a bank. Nothing wrong with it be be honest about what you are doing. You have never claimed to do this to my knowledge which I believe is a lie.
If you went with b) you are only really able to do USD/CNY futures, so the fact you offer XAU etcetera speaks measures.
Your ReserveChain also gives away some information, as we can see that you don't hold all of your assets in the right currencies. From this we can assume (assuming you are actually bothering to be solvent) using USD/Whatever futures to hedge the risk of fiat currency rates changing, or taking the risk yourselves.


That is not how banks work, don't be dumb. That would never work for many reasons (primarily they are not meant to be 100% liquid, just solvent).


The money would have had to have been stolen overnight instead of through time. Any operation is able to run a "SELECT SUM(USD) AS SUM FROM site_users" query and see if they are solvent, so its clearly not all that helpful.
They are still solvent AFAIK.
I have nothing against what you do as a service, but lets at least be honest about it.

You haven't looked into this much and it fairly apparent, but banks allow currency conversion services.

@_date: 2015-03-20 02:56:42
Correct, because they are a BDC not a trading platform. If this was a EUR/GBP trading system (like what they do with BTC/EUR) it is a payment institution under European regulations. I do this for a living.
Not that it is relevant, because this shitty company is none of these things.

Of course it can, in fact I would argue that it has already begun doing so.
For the first time in human history we have an easily transferable, fungible, non-expiring asset that cannot be seized via force or subpoena. Where transactions cannot be nullified, and with the ability to hide the transfer of money to a sufficient degree that working out who owes what in taxes becomes worth less than the cost of doing so.
In fact, we already have examples where bitcoin has allowed people to give a brazen fuck you to the law - the most obvious one being SilkRoad. While it was closed down, it allowed many, many people to peacefully trade with very little fear of any physical violence towards them, completely subverting the urges of their governments. It allowed people to transact with more safety than using physical cash and meeting in person^1 .
It unleashed a hydra similar to that of pirating, as while you can close down one silk-road, all it does is create a more lucrative market for another to appear - have the sales slowed down? Not at all.
Lets go with a less-obvious example. Gambling.
Online gambling in the US is of course generally speaking illegal, however now anyone with the software capabilities to create a gambling site has the ability to set up a site, run it with relative anonymity, and not risk user funds being seized. Each user has equal access to banking without there being any central party for a government to lean on to remove access.^2,3,4,5
Seals With Clubs operated for years out of Nevada, and was recently raided for operating as an unlicensed online-gambling site. The man was held at gunpoint with his wife and two-year old daughter, in his underwear, on his lawn. Meanwhile they seized his electronics, and have begun an investigation into his activities.
What has he done?
Well, his bitcoin was properly secured, so they have no access to customer funds. He has moved to Antigua, told the Nevada gaming commission to go fuck themselves, and continued operations on a new site. Had this been with dollars the bank accounts would have been seized and user funds lost. ^6
Other examples of course include predictions markets, there have previously been many large markets for predicting future events - such as elections. The US government shut down InTrade^7 which was based in Ireland. Bitcoin? There are three or four competing sites, which have been running for years.
The state cannot enforce laws if they can't exercise control over value. For the first time in history removing your value from government control does not mean removing yourself from the rest of the financial world.

Correct, our payment system is run by just 9 banks. 


I disagree, especially when compared to the US (lol).
You can operate almost any financial service in Europe (with the exception of issuing securities/debt/credit/banking) using one license (e-money) which costs very little and is valid throughout all of the EU.


Setting up a business is pretty easy here, and we have great access to talent, both software and legal - and moreover its a reputable jurisdiction when it comes to working with banks overseas.
If anyone is wondering why 9 banks is so few, here is the proper answer.
Firstly, only two or three of those banks will operate clearing relationships with other banks looking to gain access (Natwest, and Barclays are the two I know).
Second, we are one of the worlds largest economies, so you would expect more diversity.
Third, we are one of the biggest countries when it comes to FinTech - even moreso when just looking at Europe. If I recall correctly the FCA has more registered emoney/payment services than the rest of Europe but I would have to check on that.

exchange office, transmits money (or any representations of monetary value) by any means or
cashes cheques which are made payable to customers; 
Note: it is not considered transmitting money. They send money to their customers but not between them.
This does not apply for the same reason as a freelancing site is not regulated.
Currency has a specific meaning in this case, which is of course a national or foreign national currency.








Nope 


Quite blatantly nope




Yes! Wait, I mean no.






(a) an undertaking, including a money service business, when it carries out one or more of the activities listed in points 2 to 12 and 14 of Annex 1 to the banking consolidation directive (the relevant text of which is set out in Schedule 1 to these Regulations)
ANNEX 1:












(f) none of the above
Essentially, with the exception of a bureau de change, unless you are regulated by the FCA (with a few exceptions like estate agent) you are not a MSB!
Why is a bureau de change not a payment institution? This is why:


The closest would be money-remittance, but lets look at the actual definition here:






So, long story short you take money from one person and give it to another. Arguably you could come under this if they accepted third party payments, but if they did they would need to be a licensed payment institution if they wish to do business all over Europe, or a small payment institution if just the UK.
Now, lets take a look at a really basic exemption letter which was written expressly for a bitcoin exchange:








Now, lets just go over some more details  - ignoring the fact that we have already established that if this was the case (as so far there have been no UK specific laws applied to bitcoin) the rules would be the same all over Europe (thanks PSRs), and the fact that their services are identical to a lot of other European companies - lets go on and look at what a payment service *is*.
A CFD platform *is* a payment service
An online foreign exchange platform *is* a payment service
A credit card issuer/acquirer *is* a payment service
A remittance service *is* a payment service.
A merchant acquirer *is* a payment service.
A bitcoin exchange is *not* a payment service.
And I am 60% certain that even the guys at lazycoins don't believe their own bullshit, because if they did they wouldn't be following through with their current plans!
They say they won't launch LazyPay until they are a registered small payment institution, but, if this was necessary, they *still* can't launch the intended service legally because they would need to have the full payment institution license - the one that allows you to passport throughout Europe.
And its not like I am the only one saying this - go and ask CoinFloor, the UKDCA, almost anyone who knows what they are talking about, they will all tell you the same thing. At this point, bitcoin exchanges are completely. unregulated.
To further my point, in order to get regulated the (DSX)[ actually had to start offering straight up e-money services in order to get licensed - but go right ahead and ask if the bitcoin trading side is actually covered. They will tell you the exact. same. thing.

&amp;gt;The individual is not important.
I think this is where you will not be able to come eye to eye with a lot of people here. I know at least in my opinion the individual is the *only* thing that matters.
War on drugs
War on terror (stripping of freedom attached)
Increasing burden of regulation
Increasing tax burden
Western nations acts of terror abroad
These are some examples of things that harm both the collective and the individual, and they are a natural effect of government.

BTC-E uses Mayzus Financial Services which uses Ceska Sporitelna in Czech Republic, and last time I checked (one month ago) ANXBTC also uses Ceska Sporitelna in the Czech Republic, at the same branch as Mayzus Financial Services but as their own account. CoinFloor uses a large Polish bank. BitStamp and a couple others (including IGOT) use various Raffeissen banks, Unicredit banks at least one exchange. The list goes on fairly long, and I know for a fact that there are three other banks in Europe that will soon be banking bitcoin companies.

Sure no I understand the regulations, I don't believe you come under the term 'merchant acquirer' as you operate no payment cards, and the fiat wallet doesn't come under for the same reason that it doesn't for other exchanges (limitation of funds execution to specific products). So unless you allow third party payments, you don't come under PI regs, if you do allow third party payments you're not an SPI you're an SEI.

Stabbings are high in the UK, but thats no way near as much of a problem as shootings. With a gun you die, with a knife you go to hospital.
Guns have no practical usage, well, most guns. In the UK you are allowed to own a shotgun for hunting/show shooting. A handgun? No, no one needs that. What are you going to use it for? And Afghanistan? I have worked with a military intelligence company responsible for training up the police in Afghanistan and I can assure you the gun violence rate is through the roof. They don't have the police force to handle it so 90% goes unreported. 
As for thugs getting guns, it is just as hard for them. What I said was not for me receiving a gun legitimately but for me to get hold of one illegally. You cannot get a handgun legally.
The only people who need guns are specialised police units and the army.

@_date: 2013-11-12 22:35:32
It would take one leak that they are doing it (and having to design their own ICs). Even with their partners they need **at least** 3 months to design it, and at that stage it would be basic. Not 28nm. And then they could start production. Current ASIC companies can just press print, and ship. I know I would buy one worth half my current BTC if it meant securing the network.

$10,000 is still a tiny market cap, it's $5,000,000 or bust. We'll either conquer a large amount of the world or dwindle into nothing. Either way be safe.

$100,000 a coin indicates 1.4 trillion market cap (assuming 14million coins out there at the time).

DDOS is distributed, I made a bash script which lowers the threshold to 5 connections per ip when it comes under heavy load, on top of this I have a very secure set up as my Web server is behind a vpn, the user connects to the vpn which then connects to my site, the firewall on the server only accepts connections initiated by the root user and those to the ip of the vpn. 
The vpn filters out requests and blocks certain types of DDOS attack (its also the server with the bash script banning ips with more than x connections) 
So yes, I do know the difference

They also have considerably lower crime rates overall due to many factors.
Take a look at the UK, we have very little gun related violence. 
The problem is, when you let responsible people have guns, the irresponsible people can get them. You cannot just control them. The biggest problem is violence is often in the heat of the moment, but with a gun the effects last. My friend was stabbed, he was in hospital for a week. While he was attacked, and was still harmed had it been a gun he would be dead.
In order for me to get a gun, I have to pay a 4000% mark up and wait several months to get it piece by piece. This stops violence in the heat of the action.
You regularly hear about shootings, from the massacres to the one offs (sorry forget the name of the young black teen). But this can only happen with guns. Had the people gone into the school with knives, they'd have stabbed a couple of people (probably not fatally) before police turned up and either a) shot them (we have very highly trained armed police) or b) reprimanded them.
People cannot have guns, because people do not think. Even with the smaller cases like the police officer who shot the dog, that won't happen when the officer has to go up to the dog and bludgeon it to death with a truncheon.
My father was a sergeant in one of the armed units in the police, doing things like raids and security, that required him to do 7 years of policing and then an extra 2 years of training.
You wonder why people keep getting shot, but as soon as someone says "why do you need guns" you all flip your shit

Ah yes, well the data center has a set of fire walls and a 500gb connection so the limiting factor is my cpu, so I don't really worry, my script works very well, an attack meant I was at 250% load (I have a set of VPSs so I can go over 100%) and it brought it down to 8% in just a minute

Because unless you have a machine that is estimated to earn 25btc a month its a lottery. When difficulty goes up each month you have less tickets for that lottery. If there is a machine earning 10btc a month, there is a good chance, with difficulty increase that it will NEVER see a block.

A large change in the way we are taxed, instead of getting taxed when we are paid get taxed when we use that money, that way it reduces the number of people you have to police and only have to keep vendors honest.

While I know this is currently true, what I meant is in the future we do not know what sort of rate machines will be able to churn out.

There is a gambling site like this on TOR, a crowdfunding assassination site. So far 45 BTC been raised to kill the head of the central bank. (Forget what your term is for that job).
The site looks really impressive, you pay 1 btc to put in your 'bet' on the exact date they will die, if you get it right you get the pot. 
You can donate any amount and looking at the payment addresses the funds have never been moved.
@_date: 2013-11-13 23:11:09

As an ELI5 of that, the only way to break it would be to rip a hole in existence the size of the known universe  and turn it into a giant computer just created for finding wallets.
EDIT: ELIF to ELI5

I would buy some off of you, how much do you have (and where? I'm in the uk)

Open source Linux distro, job done. Trezor, job done.Armory on offline machine, job done.Dual device wallet, job done.Everyone will have an offline machine of some sort in the future and a hot wallet which they use on a day to day basis. Sure they could steal your hot wallet but not a big deal, just a few $ worth,It would be noticed SO fast anyway. They would have achieved almost nothing.

That is clever. the 3% cashback really would add up after a few times

Where do I find this snapcard?
@_date: 2013-11-21 16:34:20
Ah okay don't worry then, surely there is a way for you to find a buyer and get it to them?

@_date: 2013-12-06 16:21:04
Yes! This means we can have an exchange!

I was thinking about selling these as I have access to high tech laser cutters. Would anyone be interested?

On the other hand I might take out a loan tied to the gox rate

If it goes to 180 everyone will be trying to buy.
@_date: 2013-12-16 07:45:47
Mwahahaha the awkward customer strikes again!
@_date: 2013-11-12 17:31:37
Yes but I doubt they have any sha256 ASICs with the modules needed to mine bitcoin. Plus the amount of chips they would need increases every day
@_date: 2013-12-18 16:27:28
I would do this if I had any monopoly money left.To trade for btc
@_date: 2013-11-14 17:00:57
I would do it for 1%, no doubt about it.
@_date: 2013-12-09 19:14:13
By my reckoning, there will be a big (even bigger than 2008 financial collapse). If Bitcoin is already at $100,000 a piece at that point people will flock to it. The government would be seizing funds, huge inflation would occur and they'd be looking at the price chart saying "we're on the wrong side of this"

This is very strange to me, in the UK the coins go into escrow and you make an instant bank transfer to their account. I can have coins within 5 mins of logging ob

I hate to break it to you but I found a flaw in your plan. 
If it takes off and the value skyrockets you'll need to update all the equipment to use electron microscopes and scrape at the nanometer scale

Exactly why I buy more all the time

Well that explains why there is a gnome watching me
@_date: 2013-11-26 16:05:10
Its both, the Chinese have a very different culture to us in the west and saving is a very big deal, and they will take risks such as with BitCoin.
@_date: 2013-12-18 17:57:34
I believe the 20 year goal is infinite dollars. I genuinely believe bitcoin will be not "a" currency but "the" currency

Downvoting everyone who said to talk to coinbase, what an asshat
@_date: 2013-12-09 19:31:20
How did you work that out?
If I had been spying on everyone and listening to peoples calls I would have been clapped in irons and the guy who found out would be considered a hero.
@_date: 2013-08-02 09:36:10
Temporarily, yes. We could just change the port and possibly work in some encryption  Web wallets hosted offshore would still be safe if you could connect via vpn.

They used outdated tech, it was like a week after the kickstarter was started that tegra 4 was announced with something like 20x more graphics power

I know how it feels, my site gets ddosd sometimes but never too much

So of course you make sure they die on that day (it does have to be the specific day)
@_date: 2013-11-26 16:04:25
Well they are buying the Bitcoin off of other chinese people, so its not leaving the country, until they send the Bitcoins abroad!

Hell with SEPA that doesn't even happen most of the time unless it's outside of Europe

You're completely right, but from a psychological standpoint it depends on when you joined.
I see the price go up $3 and I'm celebrating, because I started at 60.

SEPA actually has an easy chargeback mechanism, so all would not be lost.
@_date: 2013-11-21 11:59:31
$15 each sound fair? 
@_date: 2013-11-23 14:01:25
Yeah it is, when my family have wanted to get into btc they send the money to my account and then I buy the coins so their accounts don't get closed down. The whole process can take 15 minutes from them sending to me holding coins 
@_date: 2013-09-03 16:37:05
How? Just wondering that's been going on for a while? 
@_date: 2013-11-06 07:44:56
I know a couple of bankers and you are so right. One of them keeps telling me it's going to fail and that they know all about it but one of their cited reasons was there is not enough coins for thousands each do it can't be used to pay for anything. He did not realise they are divisible! 
@_date: 2013-07-31 20:14:17
Okay, that will be worrying when a satoshi is worth £6000

Why sell hashing power when you can mine and take profits yourself? 
@_date: 2013-12-04 11:51:10
Yeah, I thought he might be doing that a bit as well. Although it does seem there was a genuine issue
@_date: 2013-11-16 14:01:49
I'd be up for it if they matched retail, and that will still be MASSIVELY increasing their cut

I feel its better that this happens sooner rather than later when it becomes mainstream.
We're currently a fairly radical group willing to stand up for ourselves, mainstream generally just shrugs and puts up with it regardless.
@_date: 2013-11-27 07:42:33
I don't think we need a debate, I think we need to help big bitcoin companies /charts to just do it already. 
@_date: 2013-07-17 20:08:05
If you had a server farm the size of the galaxy you would be able to break bitcoin

Supply and demand, now less supply.

I disagree, its fairly believable.
