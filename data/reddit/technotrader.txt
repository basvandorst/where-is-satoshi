The Trezor has a passphrase option; whatever you enter basically acts as a 25th seed word and shows you the addresses only in that. So you can enter "guntohead" and load 0.5 BTC into one address of that bunch, whereas the real password would be different and hold your entire stash.
(Edit to add): Ledger has something similar I think. Hidden wallets are the one defense against the $5 wrench attack; limited, but that's what we have.

The laptop is not necessarily needed, but I find it odd that the PC guy wouldn't enthusiastically follow up about potential riches. I certainly would have checked that very night and told you immediately. He's not driving a new luxury car, is he?

I'm not sure I'd take a guy suggesting "electrumpassword" seriously after the community has been at it for days. I'm up to 122 Billion guesses, actually wrote a script that shuffles a password according to your specs; coming up with *test{PASS}electrum';l[po* and a thousand like it, then running that through a breachdb with 500MM entries.
Incidentally, I also tried checking for strong passwords as you suggested, but it didn't help really: only 15-20% were weak, and it slowed things down to check.
You may have to start negotiating with the pros. Or, just sit on it until you can crack it with a future computer ...
@_date: 2017-12-11 14:21:25
Goddammit dude, you keep on moving the goal posts! What happened to "15 is the only number that I would add to the end"?
So I guess now it's "15" and/or a special character.
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:12:25
Assuming each digit has 95 possibilities (upper, lower, number, symbol), that's 95^18 = 4*10^35 possibilities. A quick google says that means impossible even several years out.
That said OP, keep the file! Perhaps it's crackable in 10 years :)
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:06:09
Please get the laptop back anyway. Even if it's "wiped", it can be scanned, hopefully by someone who remembers what they're doing. Find out who has the laptop, then announce yourself coming over shortly after to get it.
I mean maybe it's nothing and all your brother's BTC went bust on the MtGox fiasco back then.  But yeah this sounds fishy.
Edit to add: how about other drives? Your brother ought to have had backups of his wallets if there was real money in it.

I learned this lesson the hard way. In the last two decades, I've owned Netflix, Apple, Amazon, Arm, Tesla and some other high- flyers.. and sold them when I made 100% or 200%. Solid return, but NFLX for example has gone up 10000% since then. I would have fat-fired a while ago had I just held onto them.
I'm not making the same mistake with Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-16 18:27:34
Aw shit :)  Okay, don't use them then. Whoever printed those cards may have kept a copy of the private key and it just waiting for someone to transfer money into the wallet.

@_date: 2017-12-12 22:28:29
All right. So now you have to gather as much info about your password habits as possible. For example, do you have a system? Tend to reuse passwords? Keep them short, usually use upper/lower/symbols, etc. etc.
The more you can collect, the easier it will be to brute force the key. You can employ walletrecoveryservices.com (they charge 20%), or you can try the people in this sub first. *Very important*, there might be ways for the people to help you crack your wallet without you having to expose your private key.

@_date: 2017-12-11 14:36:27
Allright. So is it likely to be a 15 at the end AND a special character? Or 15 OR a special character?
I think quite a few people are still working on this. The more specific you can be about the password, the better... 
@_date: 2017-12-16 18:20:00
The "receive bitcoin" part is your public wallet address, you can give this out freely or check the balance on blockexplorer.com.
The "import bitcoin" code is your private key (under a sticker it seems) that you need to access the Bitcoin. Obviously don't give out the key to anyone.
Electrum is a good computer wallet that can import the private key for you (if you have a webcam).
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:32:13
Just barely under $10k, yes.
Why, is there any indication that that makes a difference? I don't think I'd ever need more than $10k/day, so I haven't bothered to look into increasing limits or looking into downsides.
@_date: 2017-12-12 19:41:06
Those guys have missed the fact that you have an unlocked wallet file. If it's indeed the same wallet with the 4.75 BTC on it, you're golden. Because that's where the password is, on the file, not the blockchain or anywhere else.
If it's a different wallet though, you will have to try a dictionary or brute force attack. Do let us know :)

@_date: 2017-12-11 10:36:40
"Yes" to all your questions.
I did exactly that for Bitcoin Cash and Gold. Transfer the Bitcoin out of your BTC wallet, find some dodgy wallet to import the private key (or you can use the seed), find the old balance intact (since you didn't spend it on the fork yet), send to Bittrex, trade for BTC.
@_date: 2017-12-11 12:02:12
You just need to get "more verified" by your exchange. For example, on Gdax, the increase limit dropdown box goes to $25MM. Of course they probably get quite personal with you (linkedin profile and bank statements requested right on the form), but it's possible.

I'm sorry for your loss. I can't imagine losing my brother so early.
Now, there are a few places where you can look for bitcoin:
   1. The miner. It won't have any BTC on it, but it will have the login data to the mining pools where there might be Bitcoins.
   2. Software wallets. A file called wallet.dat or default_wallet, etc. on the computer. 
   3. Edit to add: wallets on backup drives and USB sticks.
   3. Hardware wallets. A small device that looks like an USB stick or a cheap remote control, but with a tiny screen. 
   4. Seed words. A list of 12, 18, or 24 unrelated words (like "horse eat use flower gain" etc) written down on paper.
   5. Exchanges. You can gather which ones by looking through bank statements or email if available. You might also have luck writing to some with a proper death certificate (know though, that support usually sucks at these places).
Now, since you say you know nothing and might encounter some roadblocks like password protection, etc. It might be ok to seek help. Don't hand anything over to anyone though; always be present when your helper looks at things.
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:00:34
Yes indeed. You can then spend/transfer your bitcoin in your original wallet, then import the seed or private key in the altcoin wallet and spend it again. Magic :)

I want to piggyback on comment and thank you for sharing. There are a few "you should have" comments in here that wouldn't have helped at all (such as buying a new hardware wallet, then entering the seed through your PC).

While I don't like shanita10's attitude, s/he is not wrong. Linux has a historically better architecture, has had appstores for two decades, a smaller likelihood to have random software such as indie games and toolbars installed, and a much smaller and more competent user base.
All in all, if you want to infect computers, Linux is a too-small and unworthy target, except maybe for government- level espionage, an entity that isn't interested in Bitcoin.

The biggest risk in my mind is a major exchange breach, either hacked or robbed at gunpoint. 'Bit off topic, but I'm honestly surprised (and relieved of course) that no one has staged an armed assault on Coinbase or the like. If you look up "biggest bank heists", they were in the millions... with crypto, we're talking billions! And you can take them all with you on the plane to your tropical paradise.
Second biggest threat would be a major government move against it. Not China half-assedly putting their hands in, but the EU or US completely banning it, putting in network blocks and prosecuting offenders.
In contrast, a bubble burst would probably not kill it. Much like the houses and mortgage markets are still around.
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:55:23
Nothing happens to your Bitcoins in a fork. You simply own both coins going forward. The chain with less support (and thus, much lower price) will then be labeled an altcoin, and the main chain will still be called Bitcoin.

Cash- settled futures are gambling with a contract. You agree to ~~buy~~ price the asset in "x" months for "y" price. If the price is higher than you anticipated at that date, you pay up. If it's lower, you get paid the difference. No actual buying or selling of BTC occurs, it's purely a bet based on price.

Oh, now I feel not right! Not claiming the tip, although thank you for the vote of confidence :)
The way Mint works is that you give it your access credentials: user id &amp; password. This is so they can log into your bank on your behalf, and that's why I was reluctant to use the service. I mean, they *say* they keep it ultra- safe and all, but in the end, some people who work at Mint *have access to your login data*. I consider this the biggest hurdle to using them.. if that's not a problem for you, hey, try them out, they're free.

I was a mint refuser once, too! :) Too paranoid to give a 3rd party my Vanguard or bank account passwords.
I'm now an avid user because I limited scope: my checking account now has under $10K in it most of the time (moved savings to a different institution), and Mint knows nothing about my brokerage or savings account. So the net worth is off, BUT the trends, spending categorization, and instant transaction checking via mobile work just dandy.
TL;DR: use it for low- balance and credit cards accounts only, not investments.

Just some quick math on the clogging issue: there are 14,000 Starbucks in the US. Let's say each of those creates 2 transaction a minute in rush hour. Even if only 5% of people paid with Bitcoin, that'd be 23 transactions/sec.

Kinda, although I wouldn't call it "send". The way to use a paper wallet is to import it to a software wallet, which can then send it to an exchange like bittrex where you can trade your BCH back to BTC.

**Easy answer**: $471k filing jointly
**Longer answer**: short- and long- term taxes are correlated in a way that is not immediately intuitive. Your short- term income defines your brackets, and the percentages you pay in each bracket. For your long-term (capital gains) taxes, you basically start out at the income bracket, but they have different percentages.  
For example, if you make $60k, you pay 10% of income taxes on the first $18k, and 15% income taxes on the rest. However, you're still in bracket \ with that, and the long-term taxes are 0% there. So you can realize another $15k in capital gains at 0%, then 15% on whatever is on top of that.
[This wikipedia article]( has the details.
@_date: 2017-11-28 17:48:38
If you want to use the seed method, you'll have to create a new wallet within Electrum. It'll show you the seed then and also ask you to re-enter it. Then send the BTC to that new wallet.

Nah man, if you're married and your income is &lt;75k, long term capital gains up to that limit are taxed at *zero percent*. Then after that 15%, 20% and eventually 23.5% for really high gains or income, but long term taxes are always lower than short term/income.
@_date: 2017-11-05 16:54:32
But once you cross that threshold of $38k with income+sales, you do start paying capital gains taxes. So, converting BTC for Lambos or houses would easily push you into that.

My virus scanner already finds signatures in the blockchain, someone once found it oh-so-funny to embed (old and harmless, but still triggering) viruses.

Good point. I love me some low fees and good tx throughput, but the network probably shouldn't be all that accommodating as to invite malicious characters. People would start uploading pictures and movies just because they can, or to sabotage the coin.

For anyone curious, I clicked the link in a quarantined system; it goes to a rather well- made (edit: meaning, not scammy looking, while clearly still being a scam) trading robot setup called DAXrobot. [Picture.](
With this thread and the one yesterday, it seems this user has been sending spam for days to thousands, if not all people in this sub, over several days. How much reporting does Reddit need to actually block him?

Some simple math. He says he's lost more than $500k and the BTC price in the video is mentioned as being at $6500. Assuming that's from the all time high, we can deduct he has about 40 coins, i.e. his net worth went from near $800k to now $170k. Ouch.
Interesting guy, I must say. I like his minimalist, no-exit-plan lifestyle, although I'm not sure I'd take my kids out of school. But definitely someone to have a beer with sometime.

There's two important pieces missing in that article: how did they track down the guy? And doesn't Coinbase use the authenticator app which you can't just clone by hacking the phone SIM? 
@_date: 2018-03-16 16:17:45
Nothing but virtue signaling. Look at the guy's website (blocside.io), not a single black person or woman in sight! Less data on the woman's web site (darcmatter.com) but again, the CEO and the CTO are white/asian guys, and surprise, she does the marketing.
Frankly, they look like tokens. That's beside the fact that I wouldn't trust people who chose to market to specific races or sexes. Blockchain tech is a meritocracy.

But you can't send coins when connected remotely - you have to press the send button on the Trezor itself. OP says the seed is in a lockbox as well, so this is quite puzzling on all levels.

Yepp, just caught this by chance. Node is back up, with twenty connections and counting. Decentralize!
NB: instead of trusting the ppa, I just run it in a dedicated VM. 2GB ram and 1 cpu is enough.

No that's unfair. "Intelligence tests" are investments promising to double in a year, or large payments for smuggling money out of Nigeria. But the con men behind BCH hijacked the bitcoin name, domain and twitter, and are waging a disinformation campaign. They don't attract suckers, they deceive people.
At best, you could say it's a knowledge test, but that's also not cool, because people interested in Bitcoin ought to not get scammed outright, just like when I buy gold I expect it to not be gold- plated lead.

Google uses about the same power. Yes both cases are a bit unfortunate, but we do get utility out of them, and there is a shift happening towards renewable energies, too.

Not sure what happened to your particular install, but my upgrade was easy. I don't even remember a reindex? Just stop, sudo apt update, start, the end.

By generate your own seed, you mean you let the Trezor generate it and you wrote that down, not you used another means and "restored" the Trezor with it, right? I know I'm grasping at straws here, but it all points to someone having your seed words. That, or physical access to your Trezor and knowledge of your PIN.

I was shocked to see cheques used when I came to the US, but have since warmed up to them. They cover the one use case where you want to authorize someone to draw funds from your account *one time*.
I've battled multiple companies in Europe (telecoms, publishers, etc.) where I'd cancel a subscription and they would just continue to draw funds from my account since I had authorized them a while back. Never happened in the US.
@_date: 2017-10-19 18:45:03
You can bring as much money into the US as you want, but you must report it if it's over $10k. If you don't report it, customs may take it from you. If you do report it, I'm sure they or other agencies will be asking some questions. Which is probably okay since it's not like it's dirty money.
But, I'd be more concerned to be walking around with a huge amount of $$, or even leaving it in a hotel safe, all the while frequently meeting with people you don't know, but who know of you that you have cash and bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-27 12:10:28
Of course. But some corps don't take credit cards, like my ACA health care or my co-op management. I can still automate this by the way; my bank sends the cheques on my behalf, but when I stop it, it stops.

I'd be ok with the cost base, but whether or not it's long- term or short- term gain is up in the air. I do see some articles that support the events being long-term gains, like with a corporate spinoff.

How was it given to her? Was it on a piece of paper with a QR- code? A dozen words scribbled down on a napkin? Or transferred to an app on her phone?
If she has something like that, there is a chance that she can access it, but with nothing in hand, I don't see how. Even the tipper wouldn't have it anymore.

Try wiring different currencies. One of the banks will convert it at a rate depending on how much you're wiring, but guaranteed worse than when you naively look up the fx rate (spot rate).
In that case, it's better to convert currency 1 to BTC, transfer that, then convert BTC to currency 2 at the receiving bank. I've done this and it's shaved several % off the cost, which adds up quickly of course. But it's a real pain doing all that.
I can't wait to not have to convert currencies at all and travel using Bitcoin.

The thing is, according to most "experts" (blogs and resources like cointracking.info), the bcash ~~airdrop~~ fork should be counted as income. *Even if you did nothing*.
And of course I sold my bch, but even so I don't understand how this is "income", and not long-term capital gain. I bought those coins years ago. Hhhrgn.

First- world FIAT currencies. Those are pretty much in lockstep; you'd have to look at 10+ years to see a big variance. But BTC/USD (or BTC/anything), can do this shit in a month :)

Is this seriously the consensus? The USD with all its political might, not to mention the army, will be worthless?
@_date: 2017-05-04 19:52:50
I hear what you're saying, we can't put a number on it. But we might put probabilities on it, and keep in mind some questions are already sufficiently answered. Specifically, Bitcoin being legit and continuing to be so in the future (or, the government having some 'splaining to do over why they sold BTC themselves).
@_date: 2019-05-22 19:32:52
That Pizza Guy may well have been pivotal for Bitcoin. The idea to print money at home and then buy something physical with it was completely nuts to most people back then.
Dude came across as pretty level headed on his interview, too. At least he can sleep knowing that he advanced Bitcoin, versus, say, losing them on MtGox.

Breadwallet seems to use a special derivation path for its seed mechanism. If your new wallet can do different implementations, you ought to be able to restore on them. For example, [here's an electrum guide.](

Given your btc/share number, it turns out this firm is trading at ~31% premium over actual BTC. This sounds like a recipe for implosion the moment a Bitcoin ETF is approved, in addition to the ole 'not your keys...' problem.

And a substantial part of this is going through exploitative services like Western Union. Fleecing the hard- working unbanked population; it doesn't get much lower than that on the "how to make money off people" industries.

I've come to the same conclusion. A farmer selling his future crop so he can finance his tractors makes perfect sense. But Bitcoin futures are pure gambling, and after that article that postulated it was suppressing price, I guess I hate futures now.
Now, a proper ETF backed with actual coin, yes please. I need this in my Roth IRA.

Yes. It's one of the better wallets out there.

I think the problem that this researcher has is that Jaxx pretends to secure the wallet (using a PIN), but then only encrypts it with a hard- coded key.
So yeah it's a bit less safe than I would have assumed, although frankly if the app works with a PIN, it's a giveway that the encryption is low grade already. The solution that the researcher suggested (using the PIN for encryption) is crackable within seconds, too! All you have to do is try 0000-9999 for a key.
