$28,496  I think this years “crash” will have people scared once it passes that twenty mark and may trigger another sell off.

Not everyone is in it for the mad gainz yo, it goes much deeper than just making some money. Bitcoin can and will change the world.

Let’s kill him! 
@_date: 2018-11-29 06:53:39
Nah we don't want it back up, long live the cheap coins! 
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:17:09
yes it will :)

My power is free for me... however it was a lot of work burying the extension cord to my neighbors house

Blowing your load on yourself seems pretty gay. 
@_date: 2017-05-24 22:18:06
Then buy some more!

We're on the way back up, weak hands got taken advantage of and people got cheap coins. Simple slow rise til 7am from here. Might drop slightly after that but it'll climb to and past 3 k for certain.

Coinbase is down, but fixed their card issue so maybe there is a lot of traffic. 
Edit: And it's back on

Made my night!
@_date: 2017-05-25 04:06:09
All in.... Now!
@_date: 2017-05-25 03:59:38
Nah, it blew up! Still climbing and people keep throwing in coal. Choo choo!
@_date: 2017-05-25 07:54:44
Dammit dan!
@_date: 2017-05-24 22:15:23
You, buy some too. 
@_date: 2017-05-24 07:17:38
The way bitcoin is climbing I'd say 100% it will hit 2500, however your only talking about 20 coins which is roughly less than 10% of your "portfolio" so it seems like a no brainer to me to pull out your initial investment and sleep well at night. But understand that you could be missing out on money later on. And while your at it go ahead and send me 1 btc for my wonderful advice : )
@_date: 2017-05-24 22:10:45
Buy, duh. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 03:56:01
I just put down another $700
@_date: 2017-05-26 08:27:40
Coinbase caused the "crash". Truth is that this isn't a crash and people are just in panic mode. In the next 24 hrs it'll be right back up 2700-2800 
@_date: 2017-05-24 15:20:27
Just wait, and buy a little when you can. Hold until 2025.

You have to un-do 30 pushups for every $100 it drops!
