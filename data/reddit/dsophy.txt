Exactly just look at Japan's wildly prosperous economy since 1990. Deflation is awesome for the economy! Modern economics is a vast global conspiracy!

ASICMiner blades have shipped.  I hear Avalon has shipped as well.  There's tons of articles/posts about ROI - google is your friend on this one.
I actually preferred to just buy ASICMiner stock since I didn't want to set up my own rig.  The stock issues weekly dividends per share of BTC, so it acts kinda like a mining rig would, and it has the benefit of being a managed asset and will theoretically remain profitable for much longer than a mining rig.  ASICMiner also sells hardware (obviously), so you get to profit from the gold rush by mining for gold and by selling shovels! 
I bought in at 0.7BTC though, now its at 2.5 so the ROI is going to be much longer.

Dear Mt. Gox - If you are going to write an announcement in english, please hire someone who is fluent in english to write it.  Oh - and while you're at it, tell that person to communicate during major events instead of several hours after.

Well its nifty because its a USB stick with a decent hash rate, not because the ROI is good.
I think most who are buying them are doing so as novelties or because they don't want to build a rig around mining yet still would like to mine.

I loved Rand when I was in High School and through University.  I voted libertarian the first two times I was of age.  I definitely drank the coolaid for a long time.  I then left the US for several years for work and had a very liberal (nearly socialist) period that lasted for a couple years.  
As I've gotten older and mellowed a bit I've found that life is much more complicated than these more rigid frameworks usually allowed.  With that understanding came some disappointment, since before this realization all the world's problems seemed imminently solvable if only people would wise up and do what I said.  
Today I'm I guess what you could call a moderate in most things, which could very well change again, I'm definitely not done learning.
If you've been in the same mindset for 20 years then a vacation from that mindset might be in order.  I'll consider going back to Rand if you consider taking a break from her :).

I don't know what to do with this essay.  It's just a bunch of tautologies with some painting analogies thrown in.  It is characteristic of Rand in that it demonstrates a sophomoric understanding of human nature and economics and resists any objective (irony here) measurement or analysis.
What is Rand's answer to child hunger in the US?  What about regulating the use of open access resources or controlling pollution?  How would Rand suggest that we balance the privacy or even lives of individuals against the welfare of millions?  
These are questions without cut and dry answers.  They call for multifaceted solutions with significant flexibility.

I don't think I'm trying to change the topic, but even if I was that would not really be intellectually dishonest.  
I'm not really going to continue this dialogue since I don't think we're getting anywhere.  If I can give you some advice - take a break from Objectivist and Libertarian ideas for a bit and try on some new perspectives.  You can always go back, and if you do you'll know that you're doing so with better information.

I can't find anything that says the shareprice drop is due to withdrawals.  Instead I see macro effects (obviously turkey's market is not doing great today) and some rate cap regulation driving down the price.

Why is it not a problem?  Deflation caused by declining demand (even if this is only due to a contracting monetary supply) is almost always a bad thing.


Actually research in this area is inconclusive.  Centralized and decentralized systems are both susceptible to corruption and neither seems inherently more resistant without the proper controls in place.  Good empirical examples of bad decentralization are Russia and India - where decentralization has made corruption massively worse.

You're just saying that there is no such thing as a bottomless deflationary spiral.  
The bottom of the spiral is when people finally spend, but that could be (and likely would be) long after significant damage was done.

I bought a few shares of ASICMINER-PT when they were 0.7, then a few weeks ago I bought a bunch of TAT shares with the divs :).
They both track the same base asset.  The only theoretical difference, besides TAT shares being 1/100th of a share is the asset manager.  Burnside runs btct.co and has a bit more history than ThickAsThieves - though both seem like upstanding guys as far as the bitcoin community goes.

Are you claiming that deflation can't happen with commodity backed currency?  If so then please explain, if not then how does one better combat deflation in a commodity based monetary system?
I said inflation provides incentives for investment, not consumption.  No one is going to consider buying a new TV just because inflation is 2.5%, but they might consider investing in equities instead of AAA bonds.  Investment might increase consumption by lowering prices and increasing wages but I would argue that this is a good thing.  
First access to money is a problem, but its a problem of corruption and exploitation - not a problem with the monetary system.  Banks can exploit commodity systems as well.

Show me one historical example of demand side deflation that did not lead to lower economic performance for the society affected.


Please provide some evidence for your claim here.  Both of those economies are massively more decentralized than they used to be.  They're also objectively more decentralized than most other nations in their peer group.
Here is some evidence for my claim:
[World Bank Report on Decentralization in India](
[ISEC Paper on Fiscal Decentralization in India](
[World Bank Paper on Fiscal Decentralization in Russia](

Agree - Volatility is way too high to be used as a common mode of payment for most merchants.  This is partially exacerbated by the serious lack of liquidity as compared to most major currencies.  
Until bitcoin stabilizes and liquidity significantly improves you won't see it used as a real medium of exchange.  For both these things to happen you need a higher market cap - paypal volumes would just start to be sufficient unless conversion to other currency is made much cheaper and easier.  
Which means, if you think Bitcoin is not going to fail, you're basically saying it is going to get a hell of a lot more expensive at some point in the future.

Apologies for the philosophical critique here, but I think its warranted because objectivitism is pure philosophy and rarely concerns itself with the real world.


This is the problem with Ayn Rand.  She casts the world in black and white.  There is always a right answer (hers) and any compromise is not only wrong, but its evil.
This is not the way the world works.  Human society is highly complex and nuanced.  There is usually not one right answer, instead there are a multitude of choices, some are locally optimal solutions, but there is almost never a globally optimal solution to our society's most pressing issues.
@_date: 2013-04-09 22:25:01
Very true.  I guess the bigger problem right now is the huge deflationary pressure on BTC which may cause consumers to horde it instead of spend through services like Bitpay.
@_date: 2013-03-07 19:26:15
Bitcoin needs liquidity more than anything. Things like this help improve liquidity.  
A for profit business is not going to spontaneously start accepting an illiquid form of payment.

Prices rising too fast will put us in a deflationary spiral.  Additionally, controlled and somewhat predictable inflation acts as an incentive for people to invest.  
Too much inflation is very bad.  Some inflation is good.  No inflation is bad.  Deflation is very bad.

Objectivism espouses charity only when it provides some benefit to the giver.  The most common analogy is to compare charity to an investment in society.  
However this doesn't really stand up when you talk about child hunger in the US.  We don't really need more people here, in fact the argument can be made that there are or will soon be too many people.  Additionally, impoverished children are much more likely to themselves be poor, suffer from more health complications, go to jail, and become addicted to drugs.  Feeding poor children is a bad investment if you consider letting the starve - or euthanizing them as a valid option.
This is an extreme application of the objectivist ethos, but Rand herself was a proponent of extremism.


Work for what?  Open-pool resources like forests are owned by the community, or no one.  I suppose some open-pool resources, like forests and coal mines can be sold by the community, but usually the decision to sell these is not unanimous and often carry significant negative externalities for a minority of the community.  This is further complicated when you consider the temporal effect of these decisions.  For instance, I am sure that the children of the native americans who sold a large portion of the United States for a few dollars had wished their ancestors had bargained harder.
Our society deals with this issue through a nuanced system of voting and top down regulation which balances public utility with individual utility - but this is certainly not the objectivist way to deal with it which mandates a complete focus on individual utility.


What price do they pay?  Who sets this price?  Many people have differing levels of tolerance for things like air pollution which can be based on different preferences/beliefs, medical issues, and levels of acceptable risk.  How do we weight these things to come up with a cost without prioritizing some individual or group's utility above another?  
Life in a functioning society requires compromise in almost all things.  This means that sometimes we must make compromises.  This is the fundamental flaw at the heart of all extremism, including objectivism.

Set aside Krugman's argument.  The conclusion of the article, about competing crypto currencies with different monetary philosophies is interesting.  
If you could find a way to inflate a currency at a rate that changes in a way that is both predictable (ie in response to some external economic indicators) and constructive, wouldn't you have at least an interesting alternative to BTC that could also serve a role in the future monetary economy?

Popularity of opinion does not infer mastery of a subject.
I read the essay when you referenced it and also about 10 years ago when I too believed that Objectivism was a really great idea.  
My argument refutes the central tenant of that essay, in fact really her only tenant, that ethics is black and white and that grey is in fact evil.  Rand provides countless rephrasing of this central idea through that essay, but does not link her theory in a meaningful way to the real world.  
The latter part of my last comment seeks to start a discussion based on real world issues instead of cerebral concepts of morality.  
Where do you think I've been intellectually dishonest?  Do you know what this means?

There are basically 2 types of deflation - one where suppliers produce too much and prices fall (good) and one where consumer demand drops off and prices fall (bad).
**Good Deflation**
Deflation from excess supply tends to be fairly temporary because once the excess supply is consumed at a lower price things stabilize.  Because supply is temporarily cheap people might even consume more and the economy may grow faster.  This type of thing  can happen when you have broad based increases in efficiency - say from the discovery of electricity or computing.  You may see some companies go out of business in this turbulence, but usually new ones pop up quickly to replace them because goods are so (temporarily) cheap.
**Bad Deflation**
This can happen when there is a sudden drop in demand for whatever reason.  What happens in this situation is that prices start to drop to get people to buy more stuff, however people see this prices dropping and decide to hold out for the "bottom" before they spend money.  This causes demand to fall further and prices fall further.  Soon companies start to go bankrupt because they are not selling goods.  Eventually as enough suppliers go out of business, supply will come down and prices will level.  At this point however some serious damage is done.  This scenario is exactly why you see governments do things like issue debt in recessions and why austerity is exactly the wrong policy for recovery.
