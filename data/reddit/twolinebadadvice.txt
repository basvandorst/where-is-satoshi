I really don’t have any advice. Currently I am building a fund for my 5 year old kid. So as you can see I am in for the very long run. 
My only advice would be that if you don’t really need the cash. Hold. As i believe ot is still under valued and ot would be really silly to sell now when we are just a year and a half away from “the halvening”.
I don’t get people berating you just because you want to earn money.

Argentinians save in dollars is deposit boxes as if it was a religion.
It was a good way of getting your hands on foreign currency when it was banned by the last government.

Governments are also helpless Because it is not like they can manipulate rates to control the price of their ~~color papers~~ Fiat Currency. In countries like this, the price of oil and the price of the dollar dictates inflation.

When you come here and see the meme of the coin in the roller coaster going down, buy.  With meme going up, sell.

I wonder what changes will a global privately owned network bring to the world. 
in many countries in the world there is no option to choose carriers and the available ones are co owned by government if not directly. 
This could be huge.

Is this what happened when the spanish brought home all that sweet gold and silver loot donated by the south americans?

Yeah, money is great. Just ask Venezuelans how good money is, or Argentines. Money is awesome, it has little pictures on it.

well. as of now they are not allowed to purchase more than 200 dollars per month. AFTER submitting a form to the tax office. Meanwhile the argentina peso is about to take a nosedive into hyperinflation. Welcome to Argentina, the new Venezuela.

Right next door ARGENTINAs new government has placed a cap on the amount of dollars you can buy per month using the national currency to 200. 
I don’t believe price will spike but we will definitely see an increase in number of transactions.

Thanks to printing more money and being lucky because of the price of a single commodity like soy.


Implemented through a parallel state and not official policy. Rampant corruption and fraud. 
There is [this case](
And [this one](


And then they place a [violator of human rights as head of the army.](






No, but thanks to another Peronist I know what it is to have your wages reduced to 1/3 and my fucking dollars retained by the banks with the option to take 1/3 of their street value in monopoly money or take a 10 year bond. You probably don't remember because you where too young.
In the end I come here to talk about crypto, not to shill some politician. If you want to do that, you can go to r/Peronia or r/argentina

whoa there buddy. Kirchnerism “saved the country “?
if 40% anual inflation is saving the country then Argentina is fucking doomed. 
also government restrictions on buying foreign currency. 
restriction on importing manufactured good and medication. 
subsidised services creating fake low prices
it was more than a decade of stupidity. if they had really saved the country how came 4 years later it’s in ruins?

i am keeping a close eye on all news about adoption. The price really doesn’t mean much because right now it looks like we are part of r/wallstreetbets. 
i have seen a few posts here mentioning price hikes in Venezuela or Argentina but global price is still tied to dollar, euro or other strong Fiat as there is still a need to convert BTC to “spending money “. 
when that need to cash in is gone is when this will truly be what it is meant to be.

Brasil is already looking for a way out of mercosur
edit: i agree that it doesn’t look like there is going to be hiperinflation on the short term. there has already been a “correction “ of the local currency and a government restriction on buying foreign currencies.  And this is just days after the election. 
As foreign support withdraws and international trust in the country plummets, it looks as this will only get worse. 
You just have to take a look at the country’s last 40 years to know where this is heading.

I am hearing this since late 90’s. Do you think it will keep on being a gradual thing or will we see some kind of big shift in the next decade?

I believe b2b mega transactions will require an arbitrator by contract. 
If you take as an example of human behavior the game EvE online. where the UI has a built in escrow system, the big corporations (guilds) use a private 3rd party ( who is a player who built a good reputation over more than a decade) to secure transactions worth thousands of real dollars.
@_date: 2019-12-11 09:08:56
well of course. There is no avoiding it. there are already limits on how much cash you can carry across borders. There are caps for cash transactions. They still can’t make it illegal to hoard cash under your mattress but we are getting there. 
Once they know exactly how much you have. where you have it and what you do with it, it is only a matter of time that they tell us what to do with our own money.

Europe Already said that they wan't to replace FIAT by 2030. I think they have the means for it as they already replaced all european countries printing machines for a big centralized one.
But If you guys think any government will adopt a non government backed crypto you are living in a pipe dream. They will design their own money and then force it upon us.

in Spain socialist party has won the elections. should we expect the same?

You are assuming you can get a mortgage in such a country.
@_date: 2019-05-02 12:29:35
Wealthiest countrie in South America is a bit of a stretch. 
Also there where mortgages probably. But as a South American I can tell you that the percentage of real estate transactions via mortgage is super low. 
As an example a few years ago in Argentina the highest mortgage you could get was around 100k usd. People are used to buying cash or through payments to the construction company where you start paying before it’s finished.
@_date: 2019-05-02 20:59:49
No. 
But I lived through 2 hyperinflation processes. Not new to to this. Are we parading badges now.?
What is your point?
@_date: 2019-05-03 10:51:14
cool i now live in europe so I kinda get you. I for one was surprised at how different banks operate with mortgages in different parts of the world. 
I was a bit surprised on how easy it is to get one here. 
But you can clearly see that in the last few crisis 1st world countries face a property bubble and a devaluation of assets whereas poorer countries face devaluation of their coin and with it a drastic decrease in purchasing power. 
we are used to saving in cash in strong currencies either at home or safe deposit boxes because we can’t trust our government or banks. It is a shame tech is expensive down there and even a smart phone is considered a luxury item. otherwise i believe adoption would be a lot bigger.
