Nice try ;)

You can apply for early access to Robinhood in Australia... unsure if they will allow you to buy crypto on it too once it is released (I'd say unlikely upon initial release).

Exactly. This is why I don't understand the suggestion that bitcoin prices would crash so hard if we saw a massive crash in tether. Coin prices would pump soonafter and what happens after that will probably be the usual dip followed by a surge when people realise its business as usual.

Yes please to a video guide

Has anyone with ING received these notices?
I'm actually in the process of closing my account with one of the major banks at the moment and moving over to ING - Hopefully I don't get two letters ;)

Inb4 this is a real fork

Don't worry mate. This is an all too familiar tale. I was guilty of it myself once, but luckily that's all it took for me to learn. Sounds like you are still up so think of it as a cheap lesson. Hodl all the way.
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:40:23
Probably not
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:56:52
same on btcmarkets - you pay a premium on the AU exchanges

Ethereum Classic Cash
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:05:56
Absolute lowest is 9000. The meme support level is too strong.
Likely lowest 12k

Where is Carlos Matos?

You are correct. Paper wallets really only have the advantage of costing nothing and only take a few minutes to setup. Good if you only have a small amount in one kind of coin.
I've got a ledger coming in the mail so if you're interested I can let you know how it goes.

mate this weekend just hasnt been normal haha. what a time to get involved
@_date: 2017-11-28 10:02:45
Pretty sure they've been calling it that since it started on the exchange?
@_date: 2017-11-27 09:46:24
im moving money to an exchange to buy more before it goes back up, thats what
@_date: 2017-11-28 06:09:41
Yeah, a bit silly trying to apply P/E ratio on Bitcoin. It's comparing apples with oranges. Not sure the author really understands crypto.
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:13:23
will break it if it happens again
@_date: 2017-11-29 00:41:21
Paper wallets are the best option if you are starting out with small amounts. Checkout bitaddress for Bitcoin. There are a few guides on YouTube showing how to set one up using bitaddress.
Once you have a wider portfolio and more money at stake, a hardware wallet like ledger or trezor might be a bit more practical
@_date: 2017-11-02 11:53:53
My thoughts too
@_date: 2017-11-27 09:22:21
Yeah, big fee and a higher price per coin, but thats the price you have to pay for an instant purchase.
If you want to avoid fees, your other option is to transfer money from your bank account to an exchange. This may take a few days to do.
Have you tried Localbitcoins?
@_date: 2017-11-11 11:54:56
what makes you say that?
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:22:48
Depends on how it got to 12k. Difference between how it got to 10k and 11k was the cocktease at 9900. If it got to 12k with another cocktease at 11900 then I wouldn't expect it to tank instantly.
@_date: 2017-11-27 09:23:10
Probably will by the end of the year though.
@_date: 2017-11-01 11:32:22
@_date: 2017-11-27 09:26:20
It is known
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:29:16
This is what I was thinking too. I'm no expert on tether, but most of the volume being traded is either BTC/USD or BTC/KRW. Doesn't seem like a threat to me? Maybe someone who knows a bit more about tether could advise.
@_date: 2017-11-27 09:19:24
hodl ofc
@_date: 2017-10-29 01:48:01
Depends on where you live.
Coinbase is generally the easiest way. You can pay with credit card after you verify your identity. Purchases are instant.
However, It's not the cheapest way as you pay a higher rate per BTC as get charged comparatively high fees on top of that.
