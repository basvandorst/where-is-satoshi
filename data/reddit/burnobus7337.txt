You seem to be forgetting a critical aspect to your situation; you CHOOSE to store your coins with Gox.  No one made you use their exchange.  As has been repeated over and over, this is a Mt. Gox issue, not a bitcoin issue.  I do feel awful for you and everyone who had coins with them because that is money you most likely will never see again but you have some responsibility here.  There were numerous mishaps over the years and countless people warned the community over and over again that Mt. Gox did not have their shit together.  
Also, why did you have coins sitting with an exchange and not in a personal wallet? The only reason to do that is if you are trading and one of the risks of trading is what happened with Gox.  Just because you didn't make the best choices to keep your BTC secure doesn't mean others will do the same.  So please don't go around spreading misinformation to others that this is what happens if you have bitcoin because it isn't, if you take the proper steps.  Once again, sorry you lost some coins and I hope there is a way they can be recovered.

Look, you lost money here, as did many others, and I feel for you and everyone else.  I'm sorry that this happened, I really am.  I've said that numerous times.  I'm on your side here even though that isn't what you're seeing.  I'm just trying to spread awareness.
I apologize for being defensive about this community.  It irks me that you are badmouthing Bitcoin and the community for a choice you made.  Bitcoin didn't make you lose your money, nor did this community; Mt. Gox did, as you know.  I just don't think it is necessary to bad mouth the community because you choose to deal with Mt. Gox. 
This situation is tragic, it really is. I hope there is some way they can recover some coins and pay you, and everyone else back, even if it just a fraction of what you lost.  Good luck in the future and keep your head up.  I mean that sincerely.

Oh noes! Want to buy my coins?!? Fire sale! 1 BTC = 100 USD.

Yup, it is all coming to an end.  Cash out so you can stop posting to this subreddit.

You haven't been opening said attachments correct?
@_date: 2014-03-06 21:48:31
It isn't.  This is actually happening.

I agree.  The log-scale really shows that hash rate has been following an exponential growth pattern.

You can take the Dogecoin you mine and sell it for Bitcoin on an exchange like Cryptsy or Bter. I trade Doge on Cryptsy all the time and have never had an issue. Just don't leave it sitting there on the exchange though, send it to your wallet when you're done. Very simple, safe, and painless.
Doge is a bear market currently so I would hold off selling until it recovers a bit to maximize your gains.

How does one acquire bitcoin if the country doesn't allow exchanges to exist?  There is no way to go yuan -&gt; BTC unless you buy from a local (or anyone who wishes to acquire yuan) or have a foreign bank account.
This will effectively kill bitcoin in China without outright banning it.

I think I've mentioned this before, but I think your username is brilliant!

As I posted below, nobody deserved this, nobody. I would say that this could be reasonably expected knowing Gox's history or anytime you store large amounts of money in a stranger's hands. I feel awful for these people but I compare the situation to storing your money in a safe while giving random people the combination. You shouldn't be surprised when it is gone. I, as well as others, believe it is important for others to recognize the dangers and risks that are associated with using an exchange to store your assets, whether they be fiat, bitcoin, altcoins, ect. The risks are lack of liquidity, lost private keys, internal and external theft, as well as many others.
Once again, I feel terrible for those that lost money and/or bitcoin with Gox but I think it is important to understand just how risky using an exchange as your personal wallet is.

Every single person that responded to you said they were sorry you lost money; a sympathetic response.  No one is attacking a completely faultless victim here.  No one is attacking anybody unless pointing out to "victims" like yourself that it was a bad idea to store BTC on an exchange.  You understand what the boils down to, correct?  If you keep the coins on an exchange, you do not have possession of your own private keys, which makes them a huge liability for things like theft.  This is like someone storing money in a safe and giving a stranger the combination.  Would you say that is a dumb move? Would you then also be attacking the victim for pointing out their dumb move? 
No one is attacking anybody.  You aren't going to get 100% comfort just like the guy in the safe example above because it is partially your fault.

You're right. P is a subset of BQP, correct? Computational complexity theory has never been my strong hold...
@_date: 2014-03-10 06:27:31
P vs. NP bitches.
@_date: 2014-03-10 06:47:36
Thanks for a better explanation. Computational complexity is very interesting but sometimes hard to follow with all the different classes, at least for me.
@_date: 2014-03-17 04:30:04
Everyone knows that.
@_date: 2014-03-10 13:11:56
And you know this how exactly?

I really hope there is a Bearcoin! If not, I think you and I have come across the next great alt-coin...

How many iterations are you going to post of this? I have not read one reply to you, nor anyone else, that said they got what they deserved.  No one deserved this, no one.  Did they get what was expected from a company with Gox's history or leaving money in the hands of an unregulated exchange, yes, but certainly not what was deserved.  What aren't you grasping here?  I believe it is important to get that message across so this effects fewer people in the future, if another exchange goes down.  Can you agree that is logical reasoning?
And how much longer are you going to hang around? You keep mentioning how eager you are to leave, yet, you keep posting...

I would expect an elderly scholar (maybe not the best word but he is obviously bright from his work profile) to frequent the public library since he has been out of work for a few years. That would explain his email correspondence. Or possibly a smart phone...

I really like the sounds of this exchange so far but I agree with you.  As much as I would love to take your word for all this, gradrewstone is right.  I think these things need to be answered because it is easy to say you will have regular audits and then not follow through.  These should be pieces of information that are known ahead of time.  Who will be doing the audits? Will you, or the auditors, be posting in-depth analysis of said audits and not blanket statements like, "Audit went well.  Everything is as it is suppose to be."  
What would really set an exchange apart right now is one that presents all the data to the customer/community and let them verify everything looks like it should.  Of course this would have to be done in a way that protects both the exchange and users.
