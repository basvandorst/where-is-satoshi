There are other alternatives aside from ‘in bank’ or. ‘Crypto’. It’s called a ‘balanced portfolio’.
@_date: 2018-01-17 21:33:24
I’ve been balanced since mid 20s. I was 75/25 stocks/boring shit for a long time back then. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 21:38:10
Nobody can see into the future. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 21:32:36
Yes! Mine does indeed. Boring interest funds, stocks, bonds, property, and fun stuff like btc/eth!
@_date: 2018-05-07 13:28:39
Why would you set the start date in 2017?
@_date: 2018-05-07 17:28:47
I’ve set the date to the earliest you can. The target price is 1m end of 2020. It says bitcoin is 49% lower than it should be. 
@_date: 2018-05-07 16:03:13
9th Jan 2009
@_date: 2018-05-07 14:03:54
Right. But shouldn’t it start from the day his model started production? As soon as you pull the date back it looks less like it’ll come true.

Balloon in the price of Bitcoin last winter was also caused by banks...

We are talking about investing here. Investing is based on the notion of value. What are you saying the correlation is between ‘code’ and the value on the open market?
@_date: 2018-02-06 17:44:21
Like I said, there’s no correlation between the utility of different cryptos and the price. There are way more efficient coins which have a way lower value. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 17:35:52
I don’t get it. You hold because you think the price will eventually go up. That’s an investment strategy (going long). The ‘tech’ is a system for buying things. Why hold coins that are designed to buy things?
@_date: 2018-02-03 22:25:20
I invested as pure speculation and made a bunch between September and December. It’s a great instrument for speculation, given so many investors are first timers. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 18:16:50
The argument boils down to belief? Aren’t you directly contradicting your opening statement in this thread?
@_date: 2018-02-06 17:23:24
How would you ‘invest in the tech’ rather than buying a coin? Invest in a pension fund that has in term done holding in venture capital that happens to have invested in a block chain startup?
@_date: 2018-02-06 17:52:18
If btc will always exist alongside national currencies and be able to be bought and sold with them, the price will continue to be the most interesting thing about it. It will be used as an investment instrument and the volume of trade of that kind will dwarf direct exchange of coins for goods and services.
@_date: 2018-02-06 17:47:24
Peace of mind about the price, right? That suggests a correlation. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 16:42:30
I don’t see any correlation been the utility of bitcoin and the price. The bankers who made shitloads in the November bump, you think they understood the tech? No, they just treat it like any other investment. Similarly, if we compare different crypto solutions there’s no correlation between the value of them and utility. Bitcoin is not the most efficient but it is the most valuable. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 18:45:26
At the risk of repeating myself, what specifically are you talking about that gets ‘rough’?
@_date: 2018-02-06 17:02:03
You didn’t answer my question. What’s the correlation between the code and the price?
@_date: 2018-02-06 16:44:15
Given this is apparently ‘math’, what happened to the utility of the concept of bitcoin in November and December? Did it suddenly become a better concept?
@_date: 2018-02-06 18:44:00
What information leads you to think the price will stabilise? I think that the lack of regulation and the new involvement of traditional financial institutions (who have a habit of manipulation) means the price will be less stable, not more. The spike and drop we’ve seen recently nearly corresponds to the ability to short the coin, for example. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 18:12:56
When what specifically gets rough?
@_date: 2018-02-06 17:27:54
How can the price be the least interesting thing about something designed to purchase things? If it can’t hold its value, it’s useless. This is why countries with volatile currencies often abandon them for more stable ones like USD. 
@_date: 2018-02-21 17:23:05
I think there’s an argument that the last 11 days was a pump and this is the dump. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 17:07:18
But there’s a negative correlation between utility and price. As volume goes up, the utility goes down. The point I’m making is that the price is not in any way related to utility. It’s just another investment instrument with faith being the only underlying value. 
@_date: 2018-07-17 21:10:40
And pretty much every other investment instrument.
@_date: 2018-04-25 19:11:14
There’s lots of things I want to buy that can’t be bought with bitcoin. What is your proposed solution, oh great crypto god?
@_date: 2018-04-25 14:18:07
What are my demands again? I’m not aware I made any. 
@_date: 2018-04-25 19:11:58
So someone suggesting your don’t lose £600 in a day isn’t giving you sound advice?
@_date: 2018-04-25 13:13:32
How dare people sell investments for a profit so they can but real word goods and services
@_date: 2018-04-26 08:00:06
Invest in something other than crypto. Find something that doesn’t seem like a completely fucked business that is at a 365 day low. Buy stocks. 
@_date: 2018-04-25 21:01:17
If you’d have asked me yesterday if you should buy I would have said the same thing ‘not at the two month high’. 
@_date: 2018-04-25 13:11:15
Why would you buy at the 2 month high?
@_date: 2018-04-25 13:24:56
Correct. But the point of investing is not to think like everyone else. 
@_date: 2018-04-25 21:17:11
We don’t know when to buy, but you could have bought at 6000, the question is why not and how do you make sure you do that next time?
@_date: 2018-04-25 16:32:57
How much have you lost so far?
@_date: 2018-04-25 19:38:58
What does that even mean?
@_date: 2018-04-25 20:08:07
My heart says I need to eat and pay my mortgage. 
@_date: 2018-04-25 14:32:51
Got it - give you sound investment advice (given the state of your purchase at the moment you need it), am a ‘tit’.
