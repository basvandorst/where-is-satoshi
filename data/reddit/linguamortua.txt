Thanks so much, Bitplorer! I appreciate it.

Of course not, but what you're asking is like asking if someone who's never had a strawberry before would have talked about how fascinated and excited by the taste of strawberries they were before ever having one. It's a non sequitur. How can I talk about how good a strawberry tastes before ever having one? I hope the inference you draw from my analogy is sufficient enough to convey my point.
You're seriously confusing the issue here. I didn't post this quid pro quo, as in, no one paid me to say what I said. They had no clue I was going to do any of this. Their money didn't buy an expectation of anything (or if it did, I wasn't aware of it). I posted it on my own accord as a response to something that happened to me; something that motivated me and inspired me.
And now, I excitedly move into the vast world of Bitcoin, most of which includes nothing at all related to someone tipping me for something I happen to say. The money I've received so far has made it real to me; it's not just some abstract thing. It's tangible and I have a reason to invest my time into digging deeper.
So, did it motivate me? Yes. Would I have posted about this if no one paid me? No, because I was literally unaware of this. How would I have posted this post if I was unaware of that which informed me in the first place?

I'll check it out shortly; thanks for the link!

Your gripe with Bitcoin clearly extends well beyond this. At that, you're making completely wrong inferences to support whatever point it is you think you're making. I find it odd that you hang around here just to repeatedly share your shoddy sentiment. We get it. Move on.

Awesome. I will definitely look into those (I'll be really digging in this weekend with everything people have sent me from this thread). Thanks!
@_date: 2015-10-05 22:37:47
Thanks! And I agree. It single-handedly took me down this path, which may not have happened otherwise!
@_date: 2015-10-05 22:44:38
Wow, that sounds awesome. I've got a friend who's a live-streamer, so I'll definitely mention this to him. Thanks for the recommendation!

Definitely! I remember the first time I saw "Mt. Gox" somewhere and got curious about wtf that name meant since it seemed so odd. I laughed once I found out, because it was actually relevant to that particular interest of mine, lol.

Amazing. I'm in love with gaming as a medium for just about everything, so this is awesome to hear about. I saw Chopcoin.io on another Bitcoin-related sub yesterday but didn't check it out yet. What a cool idea!

I've earned ~$1.00 USD. But that's still a dollar I wouldn't have had otherwise, which is amazing to me! It gave me the same feeling I had years ago the first time I earned pennies via Google AdSense. It's an awesome feeling. =)
@_date: 2015-10-06 16:04:08
Awesome! Any other gaming-related ones you can think of? I love this idea...

Thanks so much, bitsko! I appreciate your generosity. =)
@_date: 2015-10-06 00:30:33
Thanks so much, Bruce! I will absolutely do so.
@_date: 2015-10-06 16:29:04
Very interesting! I'll dig into these over the weekend. Thanks for sharing!
@_date: 2015-10-06 16:26:23
Wow, this sounds interesting. Thanks for recommending!
@_date: 2015-10-06 16:31:31
Added those to the list of resources to check into. Thanks for sharing, Frankenmint!
@_date: 2015-10-06 16:29:57
This sounds fantastic. I've been plugging away with YouTube for a while and started considering Patreon, but this just may be a viable alternative for some of the content I'd like to do videos on. Thanks!
@_date: 2015-10-06 16:03:16
Thanks for this! I'll certainly check it out.
@_date: 2015-10-04 00:47:16
Cheers, Frankenmint! I appreciate that!

Some of the shoddy logic here is astounding to me. How some of you think that EVERY journalist/writer making money somehow makes their works disingenuous, is lazy thinking. As a former tech. journalist a number of years ago, I had the opportunity of a lifetime: make a bunch of money via click-bait image galleries (no, nothing as egregious as Buzzfeed or any other equally as reprehensible outlet), which made my life easy enough to not have to worry about basic necessities (bills, rent, food, insurance, emergencies, etc.).
Listen, as a creative, when you're not overrun by the typical daily stresses in life, you have the mental clarity to create your best, most meaningful work--at least, such is the case for me. Money for me has always been something that hopefully leads to mental clarity and low stress with the monthly grind. I don't want money to be rich, nor for disingenuous quid-pro-quo-based works. It affords me the mental freedom to write in-depth about the things I care most about.
Besides, there's a glaring point that those of you being critical are missing: YOU, as the reader, will clearly be able to see the writer's works. I mean, presumably, if you're the one paying a writer and you follow them, then you're familiar enough with their bodies of work to flesh out disingenuous writing, right?
To be someone that doesn't read a particular writer, yet make a blanket statement about money influencing them for the worst, is amazingly ignorant. You might feel smart saying that stuff, and it will certainly apply to some (especially in major networks like Gawker Media et al), but not all.
It's simple: tip those you want to tip, then judge the quality and integrity of their work thereafter. If you're not satisfied, stop tipping. If they feign journalistic integrity, then by all means, cause a shitstorm. But don't just run around thinking that giving a journalist/writer a pittance is suddenly going to change their character for the worst, or as some of you seem to think, reveal their true selves.

Am I the only one around here who thinks this would make an awesome-looking MTG card? Especially a foil version!

Solid information; I'll be sure to look closely into these over the next week or so. I'm currently set up with Coinbase (have been for a long time but never had any BTC), so it's good to see this. Thanks!
