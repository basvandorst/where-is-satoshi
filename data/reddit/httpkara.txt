Same, that's what I tell people when they ask me which p2p sites to use and if it's safe bla bla. DYOR, make it a habit. It'll save your ass.
@_date: 2018-09-25 11:57:57
It could've been a good platform, they just didn't take good care of their users and reputation. Now they're going downhill.
@_date: 2018-09-27 10:05:50
Ooh, them chavistas got bitch slapped.
*sips tea*
@_date: 2018-09-28 09:46:25
Lol what are you, like a crypto god or somethin'? Funny hahaha
@_date: 2018-09-21 08:52:23
It's hard to depend on localbitcoins' customer support now, I haven't seen any genuine reviews about their support's work for the past few months. 
@_date: 2018-10-02 11:36:49
That's because they suck at their jobs. :-(
@_date: 2018-10-09 09:24:41
I don't really recommend localbitcoins, too many issues with their service. If you've read about localbitcoins, you'd know what I'm talking about. You should probably opt for another platform.
@_date: 2018-10-03 09:49:51
It's taking way too long lol people have given up on them
@_date: 2018-10-03 11:31:52
Lol i don't get it. Why wouldn't they provide support on those days when most of people have the time to buy/sell/trade. I don't understand their logic
@_date: 2018-10-22 07:18:21
man we could've been fucking billionaires. fuck.
@_date: 2018-10-02 11:41:24
they probably just shrugged it off and decided to not fix it anymore cause it's 'too much to handle' for them. ugh 
@_date: 2018-10-09 09:31:04
If you've been reading about the news about localbitcoins, you wouldn't ask that question. Lots of users from lbc have been complaining about the website too buggy or their accounts getting suspended, etc. And their support is almost non-existent, takes a ridiculous amount of time to respond to disputes.
@_date: 2018-10-05 10:19:11
Paxful and Localbitcoins offers that payment method. But honestly, i wouldn't recommend lbc. The chances of you getting scammed there is high, resolving a dispute will take weeks or even months cause their support doesn't respond most of the time.
@_date: 2018-10-25 10:11:10
One country at a time...
@_date: 2018-10-01 11:22:23
\^on point. People now are just "let's blame the platform for our own faults". 
@_date: 2018-10-02 11:30:33
I highly doubt it.
@_date: 2018-10-05 07:09:45
Why is that?
@_date: 2018-10-09 09:21:05
Have you tried Paxful? It's not an app but it accepts itunes credit. And they give you a free wallet upon registration 
@_date: 2018-10-09 09:07:49
Paxful. Even gift cards are accepted as payment method there, you might wanna give it a try.
@_date: 2018-10-17 09:01:53
Well i haven't had any issues with paxful's wallet, so i think it's okay as long as you won't store huge amounts for too long. most people use hardware wallets to store their bitcoins.
@_date: 2018-10-10 08:11:06
Oh and happy cake day!
@_date: 2018-10-09 09:06:13
Try [ it's a website with compiled links about bitcoin and how it works and all that. Hope it helps
@_date: 2018-10-25 09:05:34
\^I agree with bitcoins and cannabis but guns? Na-uh.
@_date: 2018-10-16 11:14:56
Probably. That's a more practical move imo.
@_date: 2018-10-05 07:11:56
Localbitcoins, most probably.
@_date: 2018-10-09 09:22:51
Hot crypto investors can only be found in movies lol
@_date: 2018-10-05 07:05:23
I wouldn't really suggest localbitcoins, you would know what I'm talking about if you've been reading about lbc.
@_date: 2018-10-05 06:56:10
It's happening. Awesome.
@_date: 2018-10-19 08:49:49
I already knew about bitcoin back in 2014 but I just started buying early this year. I still have regrets that i didn't buy bitcoin that time. :(
@_date: 2018-10-05 07:08:42
Be careful though, sometimes scammers buy reputable accounts at lbc and use it as a disguise to scam people. It's hard to trade there now. Aside from the platform being unsafe cause of the scammers, their support doesn't handle disputes appropriately.
@_date: 2018-10-25 09:09:50
They took care of the expenses?
@_date: 2018-10-02 11:33:38
Localbitcoins is self-destructing. Lol
@_date: 2018-10-01 11:24:14
u should probably try this subreddit u/BitcoinBeginners 
@_date: 2019-02-01 12:22:37
Here for the doge.
@_date: 2018-11-12 11:46:37
You can easily sell your bitcoin for USD using Paxful. It's a peer to peer platform so you have a variety of offers to choose from. And it comes with a free online wallet as well. A piece of advice, always be smart when trading. :-)
@_date: 2018-11-16 09:11:02
r/aww :') 
@_date: 2018-11-19 12:14:26
Have you tried affiliate links? It's also a great way to earn sats/bitcoins passively.
@_date: 2018-11-16 10:27:48
Paxful. It comes with a free wallet upon registration and they got a wide variety of payment options which I find really convenient.
@_date: 2019-01-22 13:31:19
This is great news!
@_date: 2018-11-16 10:24:38
True. For storing, it's best to keep it in an offline wallet. Especially if you're storing huge amounts. Better to be safe than sorry.
@_date: 2019-01-10 10:57:14
argh damn it ¯\\*(ツ)*/¯ 
@_date: 2018-11-02 16:54:26
\*grabs popcorn\*
@_date: 2018-11-16 10:23:10
I'm HODLing strong with you dude. 
@_date: 2019-01-15 10:11:08
AFAIK, Paxful doesn't require your personal info if you're not trying to get your account verified. There are paypal offers from vendors that doesn't require ID, just be wary and always check vendor's reputation &amp; feedback from other buyers.
@_date: 2019-01-28 13:46:42
I suggest crossing out LocalBitcoins in your options. I wouldn't be recommending that platform to people after their hacker incident recently.
@_date: 2019-01-14 08:19:53
Have you tried checking Paxful? Even gift cards are accepted to buy Bitcoin there. 
@_date: 2019-01-04 10:03:34
It was *a hell of a ride*. Props to everyone who survived.
@_date: 2019-01-16 10:10:52
I agree about their support being the worst at their jobs. I've experienced it first-hand.
@_date: 2019-01-16 10:07:05
You really think so? Despite their doubling trade volume in Venezuela?
@_date: 2019-01-04 13:57:55
Oh really? I didn't know that. I haven't tried Bisq yet. So far, I've only tried Paxful and LocalBitcoins *(don't even bother)*. 
@_date: 2019-01-21 13:44:08
\^Agree. There are a ton of trade offers to choose from. You can scan through it and pick a good deal. Just be wary, always check vendor's reputation and feedback from other buyers.
@_date: 2019-01-22 10:06:07
I actually have no idea. So IT IS REAL? By who?
@_date: 2019-01-11 15:42:10
It really is a great way to earn, just be very careful with who you make your transactions with. DO NOT make any rash or reckless decisions. As long as you’re careful, you should be making quite a good amount. I actually just traded some of the gift cards I received last Christmas. 
@_date: 2019-01-15 10:41:30
Banks are threatened, so they try to brainwash people by threatening them. Seemed like a desperate move to me. Joke's on them. Hahahaha
@_date: 2019-01-15 10:29:21
Yeah and it's alarming, the fact that they're one of the first peer-to-peer exchanges but there aren't any visible improvements from their service. The platform looks looks outdated, tbh. Customer support is still horrible. Can't help but wonder where all the money they get from fees go to. In their pockets????
@_date: 2019-01-21 13:54:18
\**facepalm*\* good luck with that.
@_date: 2019-01-16 09:50:37
really? i hope some good will come out of it.
@_date: 2019-01-21 14:23:05
hmmm, sketchy?
@_date: 2019-01-21 12:26:46
yeah. not sure what to feel abt the doubling trade volume in venezuela, let's see if LBC can keep up with it?
@_date: 2019-01-15 10:22:04
here's a great website for bitcoin references. 
@_date: 2019-01-09 11:52:03
Oh damn, really? And the weird thing is, they're one of the first known p2p platforms but their website still looks pretty outdated for 2019 and I heard customer service is still horrible. Like c'mon, they could do better than that.
@_date: 2019-01-16 10:01:30
The easiness of buying bitcoin depends on the platform you use. I don’t really like buying directly because I don’t like the feeling of anyone else having control over my money. I prefer peer-to-peer style. But it does come with risks, this is why you need to have enough knowledge about Bitcoin and how it works. And be cautious when choosing your transaction partner, always check vendor's reputation and feedback from other buyers.
@_date: 2018-11-12 11:52:28
Your security might be at risk but yeah, it's up to you anyway. 
@_date: 2019-01-09 10:55:48
Peer-to-peer marketplaces like Paxful and Localbitcoins accepts credit/debit cards.
@_date: 2019-01-16 09:46:44
hope it was helpful
@_date: 2018-11-16 10:22:27
I agree. This is how people should view this season.
@_date: 2019-01-21 12:22:53
Makes sense. 
@_date: 2019-01-28 13:03:28
But that isn't the point! The point is, there is something wrong with Localbitcoins' security. They should've known that situations like these may happen given the doubling trade volume in their platform. Once again, LocalBitcoins disappointing people with bad service. 
@_date: 2018-11-15 08:02:28
This is why we have peer to peer platforms, to avoid situations like these. That just sucks.
@_date: 2018-11-12 11:41:40
I agree, lol. 
@_date: 2018-12-12 14:45:02
HODL HARD FAM
@_date: 2018-12-07 09:01:18
Same feels but you know... gotta keep the faith. It'll bounce back.
@_date: 2018-12-10 07:38:51
God. This is heart-wrenching.
@_date: 2018-12-12 14:39:04
Defeats the main purpose of Bitcoin. Decentralization. Boo.
@_date: 2018-12-10 07:33:45
True. Store most of your bitcoin/savings in cold/offline wallets. You never know what could happen, better to be safe than sorry!
@_date: 2018-12-14 10:53:47
Have you tried peer-to-peer platforms like bisq, paxful and hodl hodl? I'm currently using Paxful. They offer several payment methods where you can get your Bitcoin/sats instantly in your wallet, you might wanna check it out.
@_date: 2018-12-14 10:40:04
Fear uncertainty doubt.
@_date: 2018-12-13 11:15:20
\^OH YEAH. THAT
@_date: 2018-12-12 14:41:55
Store it in a hardware wallet, keeps it safe from hackers.
@_date: 2018-12-14 11:15:40
*sips tea*
@_date: 2018-12-10 07:57:54
Good point. It's just that sometimes you really can't blame others to not worry. Especially if their life savings are on the line. Some people rely on to Bitcoin over their local currency cause of inflation issues.
@_date: 2018-12-10 08:21:00
hmm it could be lol
