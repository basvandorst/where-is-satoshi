You're right, but probably not at he same rate as before. Where Moore's law is breaking down as there are physical constraints to increasing transistor count.
@_date: 2018-01-15 11:03:51
As the block reward decreases I think it could only increase hashing power, large mining corporations would require a greater amount of hashpower to receive similar returns, of course there is an electrical limit to what they can have but I think for these companies to stay in business this is the only way they can.

Personally, I don't think any time soon. Please note I'm bias. So...For ETH to grow its market cap has to rise. BTC in it's self has more press, ask anyone abouth ETH and the chances are they won't know. So where will all this new money come from? Sure people might consider moving over to ETH from BTC but it's not like they have everything perfect. Like myself, I'm sure you have noticed the amount of greed in this market, some money will flock to ETH as it's on a rise and as BTC falls. Remember, the tables are always turning and the next post will be when BTC will hit 100k when it's on a run up.

Well technically it's not really anon. Since all transactions can be seen by everyone. Just the case of who owns the wallet. As for the future of trading. Maybe. It's speculative to say so. Honestly, the drug dealing silkroad spooky smearing of BTC makes no sense to me. Fiat has been used in that way for hundreds of years yet how many times do you hear. "Don't buy Euros, people buy drugs with that". Anyway just my 2cents.

Apologies for the delayed response. I see what you're saying but I disagree with some points you make (I do agree that there is a lot of FOMO on BTC and people buying in for greed is a rocky path).
LN is the solution to reduce fees so BTC is usable. That's why people want it, LN will probably be ripped by BCH as well since they could use it just as well as BTC. However, this scalability issue I hear people rambling on about (not saying you are) is nonsense. When there is a demand, someone will generate a supply. People want to use BTC, the tech can be developed. LN is a step in the right direction but obviously isn't the full solution. The technology is always being developed and that's why I think BTC has a greater use case and credibility for my investment. Ofc, I might be wrong but I'm going to stick to my guns for the foreseeable future.
EDIT: Just to address the short term pump you mentioned. BTC pumped over a few weeks. Look at altcoins, we're talking hours for a 10x gain or even more. For the market it's in. I think it took a fair beating to get to where it is.

S.Korea is messed up right now. Prices are higher than they should be and people are just scrambling around on FOMO. Even though they contribute a lot to the market, their downfall will probably not affect the long term position of BTC.
@_date: 2018-01-10 12:21:40
I'd tend to agree. A lot of altcoins at the moment are just fuzz. However, there are clearly some stronger projects to come from them.
@_date: 2018-01-16 09:23:37
Oh didn't you hear? Bitcoin is dead :P
@_date: 2018-01-10 15:09:43
People said it was too late at  $100, $1000 and $10,000 so probably not. Invest at your own risk and remember, "past performance is not indicative of future results". 
If you do choose to buy, look at exchanges. Even though it's unpopular now due to this whole SegWit implementation issue with Coinbase, they're still the most popular company to buy BTC with. Anyway, look around, Reddit, Twitter, Youtube (Crypto Investor, Data Dash kinda people). Best of luck!

@_date: 2018-01-10 15:49:38
Ok I see your point. You're suggesting that the price of Bitcoin is correlated to the mining difficulty, which we unfortunately know is not true. The electricity rates for companies vary on each country so it's hard to tell how much profit they make but I'm reasonably sure that the power plant that supplies the grid they use for mining is not of their concern. As for the scammer you mentioned. They're everywhere, that's nothing new for forex or any other sector.
Just to tack onto the end. All this ChinaFUD (not my name just referring to its colloquial use), is mostly nonsense. Sure they're trying to capitalise on BTC but there are a lot of rich people making money in China from it and I don' think they're interested in not making that money anymore.
You bring up some good points but not something to suggest BTC is worth 1000 dollars in my opinion.

iceberg analysis*
@_date: 2018-01-10 12:16:53
A friend and I first spoke about BTC around the 800 GBP mark (~1000EUR) earlier in 2017, we got in early October. Since then I've been obsessed with crypto and all related blockchain tech so I don't find it hard to spend hours of my day researching new projects. If you're thinking about buying into BTC, in my opinion of course, now is a decent time. It's down off its ATH and altcoins seem to be on a slip for now. Anyway Good luck, sorry for the poor structure of the comment and what not. 
Oo, almost forgot. The thing about not being told about the next big thing is that you more than likely wont hear it from someone; because it's only a big thing if you look back at when it was cheap. You maybe could look into ICOs that are coming up that you like and you might get lucky. However I probably should stress that most of the time its much higher risk and not to dissimilar to gambling (which is a nono ofc).
@_date: 2018-01-15 11:42:29

@_date: 2018-01-15 07:35:40
Probably never reach 100%, mining difficulty increases and block reward size decreases. I think we will tend towards 100% but never get there.

Well number 1. Don't touch your laptop for anything. You need to try and recover the lost data. Your laptop still has the files on your HDD (assuming it's an older laptop not sure about SSDs, but probably this still applies) but they have been marked for overwrite.   You can recover this data by using some third party software.
EDIT: Spelling mistake :3
@_date: 2017-12-25 05:41:51
Standard stuff. Strong hands, we're probably gonna hang around this price for a little while longer. If you believe in bitcoin just hold on to your position and don't sell out of emotion. Merry Christmas and good luck!
@_date: 2017-12-25 05:28:20
It's hard to tell, I think we have met a slightly higher low and higher high. Then again technical analysis for BTC is basically blackmagic and works like 50% (so does this mean I should guess instead? Never thought if that :P) of the time. Long term, I think we're looking good.

If you do consider getting deep into mining I recommend looking at how the profit formula to see how it works. Always underestimate your profits and over estimate your costs (as in any investment or project you get into). Finally, cryptobuddy provides one of the best calculators in my opinion, as it lets you modify the difficulty over time if you don't want to assume price and difficulty will result in a linear equation over time (the thing I meant about cancelling each other out)

@_date: 2017-12-25 05:37:32
I'm probably about to spout shit but if anyone can correct me if I'm wrong this would be appreciated!
So bitcoin isn't 'anonymous' in a sense. You can see where bitcoin moves between wallets etc. It's a case of who owns the wallet can be kinda anonymous. As for coinbase, it's not really a wallet it's kinda like a large pool of bitcoin and they say you have x amount of it. Similar to Paypal, you don't actually have the money they display it's in one of their main accounts. As for your personal information and IP, all that kinda stuff is protected by some form of the Data Protection act (for the UK, some equivalent for their country etc). So they are inclined to keep that data private and secure.
@_date: 2017-12-25 05:31:56
Well I'm more referring to your overclock. To my understanding, which might be incorrect, overclocking your GPU to a stable amount depends on the impurities in the silicon used in the chips. Also, there are a few papers correlating hardware lifespan to silicon impurities. However most of the time hardware fails from heat damage etc... Worst case, you throw it in the microwave and re-flow it for a day extra use. :P (It's 5 am for me to I doubt half the stuff I wrote was accurate).
Edit: I'm actually stupid. Thanks OP :)
@_date: 2017-12-25 05:18:21
Oh I see. Would it be the case they are less efficient mining BTC?
EDIT: Reread what you wrote and I understand now! :)
@_date: 2017-12-25 05:40:25
Mhm, well personally I wouldn't keep buying bitcoin for the sake of buying bitcoin (I get you're thinking of investing it and have a kinda purpose for it). It depends on the kind of money you're trying to put into bitcoin. If it's only a few thousand then probably keep it in the family business. Otherwise, probably about the same ratios you gave in this post. Good luck and Merry Christmas!
@_date: 2017-12-25 04:39:29
A setup I've speculated using (which should work) is by running all S9 miners to a switch and run that to a router (or some wifi/wired internet connected device).
@_date: 2017-12-25 04:31:14
Mining using your computer unfortunately isn't worth it anymore. However ASIC mining is, you will likely meet your ROI if managed correctly but it's expensive to get into, we're talking a few thousand dollars to get just one. Before you get deterred long term mining is expandable and your operation could get large if continued for many months to year. This in its self is highly speculative in keeping mining difficulty and price increase roughly the same on average to cancel each other out. Good luck!
@_date: 2017-12-25 05:05:50
Of course, you're right. My bad failed to notice that. But I suppose the same still applies since the miners use SHA-256 (used in both BCash and Bitcoin).

This video also preaches TA. Senseless analysis and looking into every single second on the 5 minute time frame is laughable.
