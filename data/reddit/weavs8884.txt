Agree, I'd definitely compare crypto right now to something like gold... [
@_date: 2018-11-20 19:59:33
Crypto just digital gold??? [

The people who own them actually use them as currency.  And over time they get distributed
Or people just buy them in exchange for their current currency. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 22:50:28
I wouldn't count on that.  I mean it is going take a little longer to hit 2500... 
@_date: 2017-09-08 14:16:26
Just not at the top of the dip
@_date: 2017-09-02 05:52:17
Think you missed a 0

These swings in prices are going to drive you right back to smoking!  ;)  Kiddin, GL!

If it goes back below $4000 everyone will now look at as you as the person who jinxed it.  
@_date: 2017-09-14 22:25:12
I'd guess 1 month in the future from now would be a great place to buy it. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 22:30:52
You know your talking about cryptocurrencies when someone refers to down 15% in the last 12 hours as stabilized
@_date: 2017-09-05 15:38:16
Apologize, not doing **daily** trades.   Guess you can technically say I'm trading...
@_date: 2017-09-14 22:23:00
lol, found it pretty funny.  Was anyone else trying to analyze the graphs in the video he was showing because they are too lazy to look this stuff up on their own?    No? damn... :*(

If you want something done, you do it yourself!

Anyone think that this may be the start of China implementing their own crypto currency?  Kinda like how a bank in Russia is starting their own "Ethereum Russia".    Step one, ban other coins from being created.... I think this is a trend that might start where everyone has their own separate currencies like most do now.

Yeaaaa I transferred all mine off of Bittrex when it was 4300 over to Coinbase and sold at 4600 on there yesterday.  Granted with fees it was a small percentage increase but I think the prices might go down a little further for another week or so before going back up so thats why I did it.   
I plan on buying back in where I believe its reversal mark is.  
@_date: 2017-09-04 19:28:33
LOL, I love that he spent all that time to write a long post and didn't realize how off his logic was. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 22:44:28
Yea, thought was a little interesting myself. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 22:42:01
That theory is only true if you believe it will be worth more in the future.  Which is no guarantee.  If you don't sell and never goes back up, you would never see your money again because you would wait forever, for a time that would never come.

I think there is a good chance it will drop a little more from its a current position before testing reversal based off the graph analysis I did.   But I don't do this a lot of my money and don't make a lot of moves in my position normally.   Just do it for fun.   
@_date: 2017-09-05 16:19:23
Since we are nit picking at what I said... I actually never said I wasn't trading :P   Just that I'm not an experienced trader.  I believe that if you aren't really good at it is going to be hard at making a positive gain this week otherwise.   I think it was profitable for me to get out and leave it to the experts during the short periods of time when I saw a downward trend coming going off what I saw.   Based on length of time and how the market reacts I have different rebuy in points I see. 
My initial comments were to Jyontaitaa's initial comment where I thought he was referring the up and downs of the last couple days... 
@_date: 2017-09-14 22:48:58
If you believe it is going to drop more, I'd sell now and buy more later as you would be able to accumulate more BTC that way.  But then you better hope it actually drops more or you will lose some BTC.
@_date: 2017-09-05 18:03:25
What is the world coming to when you can't take everything you read online as the truth!?!
In other news, I just came in to a large sum of money and need help transferring it over from India...
@_date: 2017-09-08 14:16:01
The correction is upon us!  See you guys down at the bottom!

I took my money out a couple days ago (as I am definitely not a experienced trader and think it will be going down further) and having a good time watching on the sidelines!

I know my state doesn't even allow GDAX and if I had any money in Coinbase I would just leave it in there.  No point for me to transfer it to another exchange at the moment as prices are way lower and no point in selling it and rebuying in later because of the fees.   So, people just hold, and prices don't go down as much. 
And even those with access to GDAX, alot of them are beginners 
 and use Coinbase and have zero intentions on trading.  And just hold.

Well since you bought more I'm sure the market will now go back up to the moon!  The reversal has now been confirmed here folks!

lol @ thinkin 4600 was the bottom of this ride. 
@_date: 2017-09-02 05:59:19
was over 500 dollar dip, but sure you can try and make it sound less and say 100-200 to make you feel better.  
Of course it will be fine and go back up.  Still funny
