No one really knows. The January dip seems to be a recurring phenomenon for the last several years and it has recovered to December numbers typically by April. However, past performance can’t reliably be used as a future indicator so your mileage may vary.

To fill them immediately

Starting to chew through these sell walls. Looking good
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:18:25
Melted the 13.6k Wall almost instantaneously lol

Never tell people how many coins you have. Don’t risk your security

This is why you use Gemini (if it’s available in your location). They credit your deposits so you can trade with it immediately.

Gdax just shit the bed. As is tradition

I switched to Gemini personally.
Edit: just saw your card statement. Not sure I linked it to my savings account and just do cash transfers to buy. Someone else may have a better site for credit card exchanges

Terribly high tx fees for one. 
@_date: 2017-08-20 16:26:49
That's the mining fee not an ach transfer fee

Never too late to join if you plan on hodling for the long term and you don't scare easily with major dips at the drop of a hat. It's not a loss until you cash out so just buy in small weekly increments of money you can afford to lose.

It was in the 5k range a few days ago. It’s just rebounded again since then

Just exported my bcash and sold it all on kraken for a nice chunk of change that I flipped for some more BTC. Thanks for the free money. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 13:19:18
Well, bye.

If you want to keep your coins close to coinbase GDAX is their exchange and you can transfer from coinbase for free I believe. 
Gemini is another good one if you're in the US. Don't know about outside of the US.

Coinbase always crashes in high transaction times. Highly recommend using a different exchange. Coinbase fees are super high and you're paying market rates for your coins.
Coinbase is a good place to get started but most quickly move on when they realize they are paying a lot for things that have little to no cost elsewhere.

Depends on your location. Gemini is a good exchange

Your bank probably has coinbase to auto flag for possible suspicious activity since credit and debt card skimmers usually go and buy things like bitcoin when they steal your cards. 
My credit card company flagged my first purchase and it emailed and SMS me to confirm it was ok to allow that purchase
@_date: 2017-05-27 15:49:03
They sure do. I just did it 3 days ago
@_date: 2017-05-26 03:46:48
Was having this issue on their website but was able to add it through their mobile app and make a purchase
@_date: 2017-07-30 20:41:45
There are massive delays with coinbase and therefore GDAX right now
@_date: 2017-06-14 02:21:31
I just wired nearly exactly that amount in USD using my bank to a title company and had to pay $30 to get it there same day.

Major issues on the Eth side. A massive sell trigger a chain reaction and it crashed to $13 before bouncing back up to just under 300 again

It's new investors. All of the great press about all time highs and the get rich quick stories are driving first timers in. I've been a fence sitter for a long time and finally pulled the trigger late last month along with several of my coworkers
