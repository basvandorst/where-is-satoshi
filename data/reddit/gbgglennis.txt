In Gothenburg Sweden i could not find any place to buy beer for bitcoin. I had to fly to Berlin in Germany to do that. The flight takes one hour and 15min.
I mailed Andreas Schilbach (Bitcoin wallet developer) before i went and he answered that Room 77 was "the place" to go to. 
This is the transaction: 
Beer and a burger!
