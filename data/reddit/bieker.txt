This seems really awesome, do you have any idea if OPI is generally available on North American cash registers or POS systems?
All my searching seems to point to the fact that this is a big standard in Europe but not so much over here.
Does anyone know if there is a similar standard in NA?

There is nothing really confusing about the regulations, if your local soda machine was capable of selling you $10k worth of soda in cash it would have to comply with the same regulations.
Its the potential dollar amount of the transactions that is different here.

Wow, kudos to you guys for putting your bitcoin where your mouth is.  Changing platforms and ending a business relationship with a hosting provider is exactly the sort of thing that will make these companies sit up and take notice.

How long is it going to take for someone to print their own version of this card with their own address on it and swap it for this one?
This is the worst possible way to accept Bitcoin, someone is going to get scammed.

It does not work that way. You can't choose which assets are under protection and which aren't.  Just because BTC is not a "currency" does not make it "not an asset".
If Gox owned a garage full of cars they would still be considered an asset that could be liquidated to repay creditors. 
Bankruptcy and insolvency filings are not a one shot deal.  Normally there is a requirement for the company to work with the supervisor to file ongoing reports on a regular basis with the court as they come up with their restructuring plan. The BTC will show up in the later filings once they sort out how much they have access too.

It was worse than that.  He didn't even know that the storage was volatile and rebooted the instance himself in order to upgrade it to a larger size.

Expert, no. But you don't need to be an expert to realize that is uninformed. 
I have been through complicated and protracted bankruptcy proceedings in Canada and have read enough about the Japanese equivalent to see that there are many parallels and similarities. 
These proceedings have two main purposes. To protect the company from its creditors so that it can "regroup" and come up with a plan to make good on its debts. And to protect the creditors from the company disbursing its assets in a manner that is not fair and consistent. 
Typically the company will have some period of time to work with the supervisor and come up with a plan to be presented to the court. If the court  approves the plan then it is implemented and you come out of protection at some point in the future when the finances allow. 
If the court rejects the plan then you are put into bankruptcy and all your assets are liquidated to pay off your creditors. Including the coffee machine in the kitchen and the chocolate bars in your desk.
One thing to note is that in my experience the court only cares about secured creditors (which Gox customers are probably not) so if Gox has secured debt on the books that is greater than the value of its cash and physical assets, there is a real possibility that in the event of a full bankruptcy the BTC will be liquidated to pay off secured creditors.

Can you clarify where you are getting your information?  I have been looking into this and all I find so far are references to the fact that FINTRAC actually has made statements to the effect that Bitcoin exchange businesses in Canada are not considered "money service businesses" and do not need to report to FINTRAC.
And even if they did there is no "licensing" of money service businesses in Canada, if you are a money service business you register as such with FINTRAC and report any transactions that meet their requirements.

It does not matter if they were not listed in the initial filing.
If they were left out of the initial filing because they were "lost" and then subsequently became "found" then they are still property of the company and if they have value they will be liquidated to pay back creditors.
You can't just leave them out of the filing and then do what you please with them when you recover them.  Thats fraud.
Mark is not in charge of his companies assets any more, all those decisions would have to be approved by the supervisor as a proxy for the court.
It may be that if all the secured creditors have been taken care of, he could get approval to distribute the remaining BTC back to customers.

Be careful, I was like this till my mid 30’s and then my body started storing all that crap and I had to overcome a lifetime of bad habits or risk become my obese.  Lucky for me I married a girl who likes to eat healthy.

The miners also collect all the transaction fees for the block they mined in addition to the block reward. The idea is that over time as the transaction volume increases these fees will be more valuable than the block reward and miners will compete for those instead.

Have you read the contracts? Because if you haven't you can't say that. 
NDA clauses in contracts usually have severability and survivability statements in them that make them enforceable even if the rest of the contract is in dispute. 
Alternatively the NDA could be a totally separate document that has nothing to do with the contract for services. 
@_date: 2017-06-20 15:36:43
You are mistaken.  NDAs are almost always treated separately, and even contracts for services are not all-or-none.  I have several contracts that indicate that "failure to perform" under one clause does not invalidate responsibilities under other clauses.
You just can't say "they broke it first therefore ..." without reading the whole thing.

Ok, so it sounds like the limit is actually that only a certain number of transactions fit inside the current 1MB blocks, and the rate at which those blocks are created is limited to 1 every 10 min.
Something like each transaction takes 12k to store and therefore only 85 of them fit in a 1024k block and we only get one of those every 10min so 600s/85=7.06
So either the block rate has to change or the block size, is that about right?

Ok, I tried this.  I guess I forgot to mention that I am in Canada, Coinbase allows me to set CAD as my preferred currency but does not work with Canadian bank accounts.
So I am now trying to get verified at CAVirtex.

That sucks really bad.  This was the enabling feature for a business I was thinking of starting, now I am going to need a lot more startup capital.

If I wanted to invest in US dollars I would just buy US dollars, thats not what I am talking about here.
Im just imagining it being used to move US dollars between exchanges, or in/out of exchanges.

Hmm, sounds like maybe I just need to try a bunch of different options. 
Honestly I'm looking for the "hooked up to bank account" option and have a company bank account that I use just for these purposes (PayPal transactions etc.)
@_date: 2013-11-10 19:06:57
Ok, so here are my experiences so far.
MT.GOX, painfully slow verification and no guarantees I will be able to use my Canadian business bank account.
Coinbase, no Canadian bank accounts.
CAVirtex, no clear path to using a business bank account (I have opened a ticket with support)

I don't understand how you can be "on the hook" for gains of an asset which you transferred to another party and got a receipt for.  That makes no sense.  Would you still be on the hook for potentially unlimited gains 1 year later if SO sold those coins for USD the next day? 
I am not an accountant, but if someone gives me Apple shares, and then I sell them, or gift them to someone else, would I then have to pay tax on gains that I did not personally realize 1 year later if the shares doubled in value after I no longer controlled them?
I know you guys complain a lot about the IRS but this seems really ridiculous.
