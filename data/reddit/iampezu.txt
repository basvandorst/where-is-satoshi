The government uses the seized assets in ways that save citizens money (i.e. purchasing new vehicles, equipment, employees, putting the money back into local parks and such).  They're not profiting from it at all.  The tax payers are.

I know how it works in California, where the laws are stricter than other places in the country.  It's not technically "profits" because the officers aren't buying big screen TVs with it, or taking it home to buy new cards or things for personal use.
If they are doing that, that's theft.  Buying stuff for work saves the tax payers from paying for it, so it's not really a profit.

Doesn't mean people have to like it.  But people also have short term memories.  Bitcoin can be up 20% overall for a month or two, but if it's down 40% from a week long all-time high, people will only focus on the highest point, not the overall growth.
Similar to people being mad at an all star baseball player for striking out during a game or in a clinch spot despite having the best betting average and/or most home runs in a season.

Uh.  Law enforcement can still seize bitcoin (wallets). Happens more than you'd think.

I understand insuring against "flaws in their own systems." But FDIC insured banks insure against the money being stolen.  But bitoin isn't at all like this.  If someone steals it, there's no insurance company that will replace it.  But I agree...  When things get to be a bit more mainstream, some financial insurance needs to happen.  But that means fees will have to increase, and someone will want more regulation and centralization.

Some wallets already have the default setting to show the balance in µbtc instead of btc because 325.00 µbtc looks better than 0.325 btc.

Almost all new, high end video cards can be used for crypto mining.  However, not all crypto currencies use the same algorithms.  Bitcoing uses the most advanced (SHA-2), due to the fact it's simply the most widely used/mined, and the difficulty is high because there are so many people mining it.
When less people mine a currency (usually because it's newer), the difficulty is lower, and GPUs/Video cards can be used more effectively.

Maybe it's all part of their evil plan to push crypto mining to the masses.

Because ASICs are really only useful for BitCoin.

Hahaha.  Smart.  Sounds like the warnings grape juice packages came with during prohibition in the US:

Are any US exchanges actually insured the way banks are through FDIC?  I didn't think they were.

Not sure how you can prove damage to the card was from crypto mining, and not hardcore gaming.

Right, but if he has the coins already secured elsewhere, the government won't likely be able to find them and seize them.  If he cleans them, and then uses them or sells them to someone else, his financial transactions are not known to the government, so they don't know there's anything to seize.
In the US, there is no "debtor's prison."  He may get tossed back in jail here or there for probation/parole violations for failing to pay restitution.  However, once the term of probation/parole is expired, there's nothing the government can go to get the money that's ordered as restitution other than putting leins on his paychecks, house, car, etc.
That being said, if he comes up with a different name, legally or not, and then uses that name to purchase items with clean bitcoin (or fiat currency from selling them), what can happen?  Nothing.  And, if he still has the 1,600 btc, at today's approximate value of $7,500 USD/1 btc, that's $12,000,000 USD.  Not bad for sitting in prison for 2 years...

Well then... This will be interesting.... When coinbase started, I don't think they required any supporting documentation to confirm identities.  I've talked to more than a few people who have admitted to using fake names when they created their accounts.

Too many people still think of bitcoin as an investment, which it is.  But to really get more people involved they need to view it as a currency rather than some obscure stock they don't think they can afford. 
Most people still associate btc with darkweb shit and don't see any application to their own lives other than an investment they don't have the money for right now.
@_date: 2017-11-22 15:19:24
I never said the needed to have incentives.  I simply stated most people won't currently do it, even on fringe levels, because people still view it as an investment rather than a currency.  Bitcoin was never intended to be an investment.
@_date: 2017-11-21 14:57:05
I think it might come down to people not referring to the value/cost of 1 btc, but rather what one µbtc is valued at in terms of their local fiat currency.  After that, it will take some time, but I think we may (20ish years) see people listing prices/values of items in btc instead of fiat.
@_date: 2017-11-07 17:39:53

Explain to me why inflation is good.  I can't understand why the purchasing power of $1USD has tanked so much.  The average home in 1950 was about $12,000, while the average income was about $3k-4k per year.
Sure, someone making $100k per year seems like a good thing, but considering home prices have risen, as has the cost of everything else, how is this good?
@_date: 2017-10-26 14:59:11
From what I've gathered, people I talk to tend to think of 1 btc in terms of a whole, like $1.  When you explain to people you can make $1 with a dollar bill, 4 quarters, 10 dimes, 20 nickles, 100 pennies, or any combination of these.  They don't really understand that you can spend or buy a portion of a btc.
And many people are hearing about btc as an investment, and people compare them to stocks, so they don't really understand you can use the btc as a currency for many legitimate things.  They think they'll have to sell whatever they bought in order to get their money back and spend it.

I like the "If you don't know what to do" explanation...
@_date: 2017-10-26 16:15:58
I totally get it... I had heard from someone I thought was more of an "expert" on the issue that any coins purchased from exchanges/brokers/etc were flagged a certain way, and if that brokerage/exchange/etc ever followed a certain fork, all coins previously routed through that entity would change as well.
I'm guessing that's not the case, though... and this "expert" was wrong...
@_date: 2017-09-29 21:35:02
Dumb question, maybe... But if much of the idea behind bitcoin is anonymity, what do people do for return/mailing addresses for physical goods?  P.O. boxes?  I looked at the OpenBazaar site, and saw a few EPs listed.  I have a ton from when I used to be a club DJ that I no longer use/need.  I'm interested in selling them on OpenBazaar...
I guess if you're operating a business, you probably don't care about anonymity... You want people to know about your shop.

I take it you disagree with me...  Granted, any changes to how much debt our country is willing to go into is voted on by Congress, but the Federal Reserve makes it happen in a variety of ways.
Don't think the Federal reserve issues credit?  Check out this handy article:

There was a rule/law that made it easier to sue banks/financial institutions.  OP stated the senate killed the rule that made it easier... Thus implying it will now be harder.  Banks are pushing for more one one one arbitration, rather than class action lawsuits.
Crazy followup idea here, CoinBase, and any other US based crypto exchange based in the US is now (since 2013) considered a financial institution, and must be regulated like one.  So this also applies to crypto exchanges based in the US.

If you get both coins automatically, why would that be bad? If I have 10btc on coinbase, and then there's a fork, and I get both, would I keep my 10btc in addition to whatever amount of new altcoins?
@_date: 2017-10-02 21:39:42
@_date: 2017-10-26 15:21:17
I can totally understand that... But my question still remains:
If one buys any amount of btc (or other crypto) from a brokerage/excange whatever that does support NYA/SX2/B2x, whatever, can the coins not be transferred to a different wallet to prevent future forks from altering said coins/purchase?
@_date: 2017-10-31 16:17:15
0.00002 btc.

Like when I was five, I traded a $5 to my older brother for two $1 because 2 &gt; 1.  I knew so little back then... And that's the stage/level of understanding most people have of technology and economics in general.  When the two overlap, such as here, even fewer people understand it.
I think I know more than the average person, and I'm still learning shit every day.
@_date: 2017-10-26 16:58:20
Dumb question... If the coins were kept at Coinbase, and coinbase ended up supporting any sort of fork, would all the coins stored at Coinbase follow the fork?  Or would users/owners have a chance to opt in/out?
@_date: 2017-10-30 17:43:02


That's what I think many people, including myself, tend to forget.  For many, bitcoin mining was "cool."  It was a "hobby" of tech geeks.  Now, the mining rigs cost $2k to $4k (or more).  The hobby miners are getting pushed out by corporate/professional ones.
The same thing is going to happen to the nodes, I think.  It'll be too much of a burden and cost prohibitive for the "nice guys" to keep nodes running.  This means more companies will take over the nodes, thus reducing the distributed nature of bitcoin (or any crypto). 
@_date: 2017-10-26 15:07:02
Dumb question... but regardless of Coinbase's stance on NYA/SX2, can't you continue to purchase btc there, and then transfer the btc to your own wallet on a mobile device or Nano ledger or something?  Wouldn't you then keep your previously purchased btc from fork damage?
@_date: 2017-10-02 21:36:28
And follow up stupid question, if I may:
If I buy it from neighbor/LocalBitCoins, I put that coin/partial coin in my own personally owned wallet, right?
If I go through coin base, they put it in my account (in their vault/wallet) until I transfer it into my wallet or something, right?
@_date: 2017-10-31 13:56:37
The federal reserve might not "print" money, but by raising debt ceiling multiple times, or issuing credit when money runs out, they are essentially doing the same thing.  Except the "money" isn't in print, it's all digital assets floating around the globe.
Here's a hand Google search of ["China owns US debt."](  Granted, China isn't the only foreign nation that owns US debt, but is certainly one of the largest...
If I run short of money during the month, do you think I can just write on a piece of paper telling my mortgage company I'll pay them later?  Sure... For a fee... and only for a few months.  After about 2 or 3 months they start the eviction process because technically I haven't paid.
