Thanks! Indeed, interviewing David was quite fascinating. One of my personal favourites.

I hope you're not being serious.
@_date: 2014-11-22 18:27:50
Should be good :) Looking forward to it!

Too bad, those 3 mBTC might be worth some serious dough by the end of the day XD

Great job guys! Awesome wallet. 
Now just waiting for a killer Android Hive Wallet!

Epicenter Bitcoin had Levin Keller on their last episode. He's a board member at the German Bitcoin Foundation and knows quite a bit about what' going on.

Since when are unemployment benefits, which you paid for by means of contribution, "free money"?
And it isn't to quality for unemployment benefits, it's to prevent fraud, which is fine. What's not fine however, is that they will seemingly not require any prior authorization, and Pole Emploi (French unemployment agency) agents will not be subject to professional secrecy. In my experience, Pole Emploi agents are barely qualified to to use a copy machine, let alone be given access to people's private banking details.

On the one hand, the governments and the financial sector would love to see crypto currencies be regulated to fit within the current regulatory framework, which would greatly reduce their ability to disrupt. On the other hand, as they begin to understand and grasp the potential benefits and efficiencies linked to implementing these technologies to replace their own infrastructure, they will most certainly embrace blockchain ledgers internally. 
Way to bite the hand that feeds you.

Sebastien here from Epicenter Bitcoin. We interviewed Trent last week and had a fascinating discussion on intellectual property on the Internet. He does a great job at explaining the problems with IP and copyright in the digital realm and how ascribe is trying to solve them. You can watch here:

Can anyone explain how asking participants to run Bitcoin-XT rather than Bitcoin Core will change anything? It is my understanding that many, if not most, companies develop their own implementation of Bitcoin Core, which would require them to update or re-write their software.

Elim Garak was a Kardashian.
@_date: 2015-05-29 15:58:33
Ok. Is there some means to measure the number of companies which use Bitcoin Core in their backend? Can we assume that it's a majority, or at least a significant amount?

In any case, before they start taking measure to snoop on the private financial information of citizens, there are a multitude of things they could address internally. Like for instance, finalizing their restructuring which was supposed to have taken place 7 years ago, or deal with broken processes which often results in wrongful/over payments which then have to be reimbursed by beneficiaries.
I could go on...

I interviewed Erik for this podcast. I agree that ShapeShift was a better product with regards to privacy before the shift to KYC. Those of us who have been around for the while can safely say the same istrue for a lot of things in the space. As regulators catch-up and give legitimacy to crypto, the shift to KYC is inevitable for companies building quality, reputable products which appeal to the masses. 
One thing is certain, and I've spoken to Erik about this several times, he is not happy about having subject users to KYC. In the interview, he talks about the struggle with having to do this, or else certainly face serious legal issues. I think he did everything he could to divert from going this route but had no choice in the end.

How is that relevant to KYC?

I've said this so many times before. We are not, nor have we ever claimed to be"journalists". Meher is an engineer, Brian is an economist and I'm a marketing manager. We are not beholden to a journalistic code of ethics. We can talk about whatever we please.
We're open-minded because we are genuinely interested in the potential technological change that distributed systems will bring in the next decade. Absolutely, many of the projects we talk about will fail, this is a totally new industry where there are no standards and where people are still trying to figure out what the hell to do with this tech. When it comes down to it, we do this because we are interested in people who have the balls and audacity to try new things, knowing they will probably fail, and hopefully, learn something from that. And you know what, so are the people who listen to the show every week and who have been for almost 3 years. 
I want to add that we filter out a lot of shit. For every episode we record with a project you may or may not find interesting, there are 5 others which we never even bothered to look at, either because they are uninteresting, or because we genuinely believe their creators are charlatans. I invite you to read Meher's recent set of Tweets on our thought process on picking guests   
Dude, we run a podcast which gets about 10,000 downloads a month. I'm sure there are shows about light fixtures which have 10 times our audience. We have pocketed zero dollars since we started and all have full-time jobs or startups on the side. Despite that, we have consistently put out episodes every single week since December of 2013. I'll agree there are hits and misses. Not everyone we interview is a passionate and articulate speaker, and a small minority of the projects we've covered have turned out to be flops or "scams". But when you look at the big picture, it's my opinion, and that of our listeners, that we have one of the best podcasts in the blockchain space. People tell us this all the time. If you don't agree, I invite you to tune out or produce something better.
