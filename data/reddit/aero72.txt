Until someone figures out that it's still easier to use violence.
Not long ago, in one not-so-western part of the world, an owner of a popular website was kidnapped and tortured until he transferred over the domain name, signed over the server access with all user databases, and signed paperwork for the bill of sale for that entire business.
A lot easier than hacking or competing.
People still use that fairly-well-known website as if nothing happened.
So no, violence offensive or defensive isn't going anywhere.

If most are wrong, then he is doing something right. He just needs to do the opposite.
Now, if half of his predictions are wrong, then he is truly useless.

Try living in a society with less government control (or rather less ability to exercise that control), and you'll see how a society still made up of mostly good people can be a shitty place to live and conduct business.


That won't stop, so it's a moot point in this context.


I'm not abandoning anything. I'm just saying that the more I think about bitcoin, the more I recognize the importance of modern legal and financial systems working together.

I live in Russia. Next month, I'll be buying some land, worth about $300k. I'll be paying in cash. And then, I'll be paying for the construction of a house. Around $500k. Also in cash.
Trust me. I know how to deal with cash. And it's not as easy as you think. And I'm not even a criminal. Yet, if I get caught, I'll be in trouble, for reasons that have nothing to do with this discussion.
(P.S. I'm getting an impression that you think I'm some kind of sheltered midwestern suburban teenager. You are wrong. I've seen some shit. And cash is not as easy as the movies make it out to be.)

It's almost like you are an idiot who falsely assumes that he is in fact smarter. 
You totally missed the point.
Bitcoin would make it a lot easier to commit crime. So it's only logical to assume there would be more crime. All else being equal.
@_date: 2014-12-22 00:28:11


It is one of the major reasons.


And the civilization was total shit back then. Especially for the masses.
@_date: 2014-12-22 12:40:37


Because you have no idea what you are talking about. In most of those oppressive regimes, crime rates were much lower than in the "free world".
You are basically arguing against yourself without even realizing it.

From the specs "Secure proof of payment, which the customer can use in case of a dispute with the merchant."
Wouldn't that defeat anonymity?
You pay the merchant once, and the government can subpoena them for their records, which would include both your address and your actual info like name and home address.
And additionally, they'll be able to track all your other transactions going back from the address you used.
So now they know who you are and all your transactions.
Which is what I said in my initial post.

Is it better to have lots of crime and some freedom?
Because that's what I'm talking about.
We won't have "lots of freedom" either way. Simply because even if bitcoin took off and replaced/pushed aside all fiat currencies, the bitcoin curators would become the new overlords. (Which is not going to happen. We'll still be left with the same ruling class we have now.)
There won't be more freedom. But there will be more crime.
EDIT: old, but relevant
"World's Biggest Bitcoin Wallet Owned By U.S. Government"
They'll control it no matter what. And they will be seizing more addresses as the time goes. So stop dreaming about a utopia. It's not going to happen. Crimes on the other hand... most likely will.

ROFL. You got it backwards. There is a reason I included "(or rather less ability to exercise that control)", because I knew someone would post ameriboner material. :)
US government has the greatest ability to exercise control over its population. That's why things are calm and generally awesome in the states.
In the US, if you are not insane, you wouldn't dream of going against the government. Because you know they'll respond quickly and with overwhelming force. And they will beat you no matter what you try to throw at them.
There are places in the world were cops (the projection of the government's force on the ground) are actually looking the other way all the time because they fear for their own safety. They know that the government won't be able to ramp up the needed resources right then and there to back them up.
That's what I meant by the ability to exercise control.
US government is very-very good at it.

Thanks for all your help. You've been invaluable.

From the article: I hope Bitcoin becomes a better way of doing it, but you can replicate it a bunch of different ways and it will be.
This is scary. Really. If bitcoin takes off as a way to transmit money, then what stops someone from creating their own chain and competing with the main chain? And then another one. And another one. And so on.
What if Western Union or BoA or some other giant creates their own chain and markets it heavily?
We'll have a dozen bitcoin chains. Some more popular than others. But the whole scarcity thing won't  be a factor many in the bitcoin community hope for  to make them gazillionaires down the road.
That's not even mentioning other competing technologies.
@_date: 2014-12-22 00:56:06
Sure. Let's shut down all social sites and just get busy googling. :)
After all, why discuss something, if someone, somewhere, has discussed it already.
If you have any links, great, let's see them. If not, then, well, thanks for the "direction". I guess.
@_date: 2014-12-22 00:53:56


That's a good way to put it.
But I don't see how I failed.
I'm assuming you've never dealt with large amounts of cash, if you think cash is superior. :)

If you reuse addresses, then it defeats the purpose. And if you don't reuse addresses, then it would be hard to track.
Which one is the perp and which one is the change address of an honest seller the perp used to launder bitcoins? You would have to request documentation from the store to figure it out.
Now repeat that a thousand times, and you can see how tracking them down isn't an easy task.

You know, that's the feeling I've been getting.
Like talking to cult members whose faith isn't all that strong.
So they get defensive any time there is even a slight possibility someone might question their "religion".
@_date: 2014-12-22 13:19:08


You are confusing crime and freedoms.
Those are two different things. You post examples of places where personal freedoms were limited.
What I was talking about is crime.
You don't seem to get it. I'm tired.
@_date: 2014-12-22 01:10:41


That's exactly my point.
But if you make it easy to get paid, then it will change.
Right now, a  lot of desperate people with criminal inclinations never follow through with their "plans" because the part where they "get paid" is intentionally made difficult by the government.
Taking that difficulty away might push some of them in the wrong direction.
And as far as specifics of it being a kidnapping or some other crime -- that doesn't matter.
Here is an example.
In Russia, until recently, it was rather popular among punks to steal license plates off a car, and then leave a note, telling the owner to send some money to some phone number in exchange for the location of the license plates.
They would just rip the plates off and hide them nearby.
They used burner phones and cashed the balances through transfers over and over to different numbers.
Eventually, the government changed the procedures to make it easier to get new license plates, because there was no other way to deal with this.
Imagine this (or any other million ways to commit crime), but with bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-12-22 01:00:16


Most crime isn't committed by cartels, but by tiny gangs or individuals. They don't have connections to launder money the smart way. So they usually get caught quickly. With bitcoin, it's not unreasonable to assume they won't be. And there will be a lot more crime committed by "small" players.

Reminds me of a person who had his a ear and two fingers cut off by organized robbers who mistakingly thought he was a seller of a house (for cash, actually cash not "no mortgage" cash) while he was actually the buyer. So he tried explaining to them that the deal was done, and he no longer has the money and that they got the wrong guy. The seller is the one with the money now.
They just didn't believe him. "Lucky" for him, they didn't off him  and his wife, but eventually just left after a few hours.
So it might suck even more when you don't really have much BTC, but some bad people believe you do.

Also, how would I know I'm on the main fork?
I just use bitcoin-qt package on Ubuntu 16.04. It just says version 0.14.2 without segwit mentioned anywhere.

And that's why central banks are so afraid of deflation when it comes to fiat currencies.

I missed out when people were mining with CPUs.
I missed out when people were buying at $1.
When the price was $350, I bought 10 bitcoins just for shits and giggles to put away until I'm really old.
So ping me when I'm a trillionaire.
Until then, it's all "meh".  :)
@_date: 2015-11-04 06:52:30


I'm guessing the same as to move $100.
Well, aside from the manpower for additional checks and verifications for a transaction of such great value. But since there aren't any checks or verifications in bitcoin, then we might as well disregard the banks' costs for that too.
