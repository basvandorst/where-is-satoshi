Here comes the spam to all the other subreddits.... 
@_date: 2015-05-04 22:50:44


No, he said the Bitcoin subreddit was the best place for this, and you said it wasn't. He said said not to link to some Bitcoin website - whatever one it was. I thought he made it clear...just don't toss a bunch of links in your post. Are you even part of our community at all? Did you not see the whole "This community fucking hates links" uproar. 




He also said you were asking about your personal situation which you were and that you should post it in the daily advice thread.


So, mod HFA said just remove that one link and the reference to your personal situation and submit it again and there would not be a problem (that one link isn't really an issue - it's that some other nice guy spamming about a dozen posts about GBTC kept using that link so I used it as a common denominator to flag his posts)


The other submissions were filtered because we only let one submission through. It keeps the front page a bit less "Bitcoin invaded" - we typically do this anytime it is easy to notice (see anytime Tesla releases a new gameboy)


Honestly, it doesn't matter which one I let through. I didn't pick and choose because I don't bother doing that much work. It's still gonna dissolve into a flurry of subscribers talking about Bitcoin is shit la-de-da. Does everytime. I specifically didn't pick your post because the other users came across as the most legitimate and willing to discuss Bitcoin, not just promote it.
Last time someone came to introduce GBTC to us they turned the whole thing into a flamewar. I hate how you're doing this. 
@_date: 2015-05-05 01:27:55
Thanks, appreciate it. We take a mostly hands-off approach and we like it that way.
@_date: 2015-05-04 20:49:05
It wasn't a shadowban. It was a ban-ban for calling one of the moderators retarded after they told you what to do to repost your thread without issues. 
@_date: 2016-06-24 13:46:16
Hey I appreciate you brigading our community once again. 
Please stop. Delete this thead, delete the link or SOMETHING. 
@_date: 2019-08-08 02:22:37
Doesn't the definition of that basically include all funds?
@_date: 2015-08-05 03:07:15
Not a big deal. I've always banned Bitcoin when the brigading gets bad. This is not noteworthy, I've temporarily banned Bitcoin so many times for brigading our subreddit it's uncountable. 
Convince your mods to autoban linking to us and then I have no reason to ban Bitcoin discussion. 
@_date: 2019-02-12 06:28:03
Direct costs excludes capital costs? If so, then the 16% figure is way on the low end of the costs of mining.
@_date: 2015-08-04 23:04:01
Hey mods, at what point will you do something about how your subreddit keeps linking to, and brigading, I'll comment directly in a topic that is setup to brigade our subreddit, yet again, just to make it REALLY OBVIOUS this time. 
I'm tired of dealing with brigades from this subreddit. Everyone at hates this rehashed topic, and I hate banning the word Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-08-05 15:00:37


Entirely his fault, yup. He could have just not linked to it in Re: NP links - 
@_date: 2015-08-05 14:17:39
I mostly haven't added it because I'm the kind of person who tries to poke the admins about implementing something better. I don't want to accept their stupid band-aid.
After asking your mods before to do something, after asking the community to stop linking to our subreddit (twice) I think raising a stink about it finally worked. 
Don't even call it 10-20% effective. It's maybe 10-20% effective for visitors to subs that just want to read something...if you want to participate it's trivial to do. It'll stop 1% of people who don't know how to internet (how did they even get to the Bitcoin subreddit?!)

@_date: 2017-11-28 19:07:44
Hi ;) 
@_date: 2015-08-05 14:19:28


No, it won't. It's only when someone links to the discussion from I'm not stupid. I know people do that to ensure that people can come over and defend Bitcoin. It makes the discussion TOTALLY pointless because it's the same stupid dick-waving battle. Plus, 90% of the time it's a topic about "HAVE YOU HEARD OF BITCOIN? HAVE YOU HEARD HOW FUCKING GOOD IT IS?" rather than...any actual news....
The best discussions I've seen on Bitcoin were when I still had Bitcoin banned from discussion, but I manually approved a topic and dropped the ban temporarily so people could discuss the publicly traded GBTC.
Nobody linked to it at except for one person complaining that we blocked their topic (because they linked to it at so I deleted theirs and let a different topic about GBTC go through).
It took a while before someone relinked it again at and the brigade started anyway, but the topic got to grow naturally and get discussed in our subreddit naturally before it turned into a total dick-waving battle between vehement backers of Bitcoin and people in our subreddit who hate the vehement backers. But by then had got their chance to talk a bit in peace and ask questions about GBTC. 
@_date: 2015-08-04 23:54:45
Ban linking to in Just remove any link post with in it. 
It's happened over 10 times now. It's always a brigade of many people. It's annoying and it's the mods duties to prevent brigading. Of course you want it to happen, but it not something they can keep allowing. 
@_date: 2015-08-05 03:08:37
Why is it so extreme to stop linking to the investing subreddit? It's hardly censoring. People can always join our community, or submit screenshots of our community here. Just stop linking to it and bringing an army to us. 
@_date: 2015-08-05 03:17:34
Misread that. 
You have to look at your community here. People ALWAYS want to spread the word and defend the currency. Anytime we get linked, even innocently, the thread gets about 50-100 replies of people vehemently attacking every comment made by our community. 
I'd LOVE to see natural discussion of Bitcoin on our sub, but everytime that happens r/Bitcoin links the thread and floods it with one-sided comment by comment attacks. So, if we will never get natural discussion due to brigading I see no loss anyway. 
@_date: 2015-08-05 15:40:12
It's really annoying is all, and can only be stopped with participation from other mods and communities.
I've always been calm about this. I come over, and I've asked people to stop doing this. I wrote the mods here just plain asking for help before (not instructing them what to do). 
So, what do you want me to do again? Come over grovelling yet again? No thanks, I'll come over and just say SOMETHING NEEDS DONE loudly. Worked really well, I'll head out when I have no more replies in my inbox.
@_date: 2015-08-05 03:03:34
They do. They can ban links that point to a certain subreddit from being submitted. We don't have the ability to remove posts based on what another subreddit has posted. 
See the documentation for Automod. 
@_date: 2015-08-05 12:44:18
THE CANCER KILLING REDDIT. YES. I have no idea. I don't keep track of this. Doesn't matter much now, keep that ban alive over here. 
@_date: 2015-08-05 10:34:49
I've done it before. Nothing happened. 
@_date: 2015-08-05 15:25:56


As you can tell, I'm sorely disappointed to lose your respect. Along with "so many" others. 
I have no idea how you can deny that I have never contacted you. I have contacted your team. Full stop. You think I don't know what modmail is? Regardless, how has your team not seen your subreddit hassling the shit out of our subreddit, repeatedly? Do you actually NOT READ your subreddit at all? It's fine if you don't want to blame the admins, but how about blaming me instead? Is that fine too? 
Just move on - I'm glad the rule is in place. Thank you for that. 
@_date: 2015-08-05 15:15:09
For one, yes. The assurance that the news on the front page is ranked properly although that is not a huge deal.
When I say the comments are no problem I mean that nobody is going over there and posting pictures of their butthole. However, the quality of discussion goes through the roof. We see conversation more focused on its merits as an investment, how Bitcoin works, and so on. Less "Why Bitcoin is the future of the world" and more...you know...investing talk. 
This past time wasn't so bad, but it was just yet another promotion for Bitcoin from a guy with a huge stake in it. It's no worse than the pitches from people looking for investors, or the Shitty Investing Startups advertised there. It's spam, and spam is deleted on principle alone.
Except this time instead of being one spammy goon about a dozen other active promoters came over too. We can handle singular spammers, but 12 very active people is near impossible to stop before they overwhelm our own community. 
@_date: 2015-08-05 15:37:42
Not really, I have no new point to make. I just found this and quickly copy-pasted it. Just...a fun picture of how band-aidy it is. 
@_date: 2015-08-05 10:42:36
I'm glad making a STINK in this subreddit finally got your attention. 
Blame the admins. If modmail wasn't such a pile of shit it would have been possible for you to have noticed I've messaged you guys before and got no response. Raising a stink in your subreddit worked, so I'm pretty happy about that. I don't feel incompetent one bit. I just solved the worst brigade problem our subreddit has.

It's useless on mobile, and for anyone who ignores CSS, or feels like they want to post. It's always been true that np doesn't do much but stop the most casual of visitors, not brigades. 
@_date: 2015-08-05 02:39:34
The only way we can ban it is by banning the words "bitcoin" and "litecoin" and "cyrptocurrency". Unfortunately, this also results in removing ALL discussion of cryptos. It's the only measure that works, and obviously most extreme. As of today I'm readding the blanket ban. 
Otherwise there is nothing we can do to stop other communities from brigading ours. Your mods here are pretty much incompetent though so I have no hope for this community trying to prevent anything. I'm not sure your AutoMod is even active. The Bitcoin community will continue to brigade other subreddits. 
We don't have a mod tool to detect what you're asking for.

@_date: 2015-03-10 01:18:16
I've tried in the past to bring this up as a discussion point in this community, but only with failure. This is the best reception I've ever got. Heck, even the community - OF ALL PLACES - used to need to have Bitcoin on BanLock. 
I think there's a point where I should just be reaching out to the mods here and asking if there is anything they can do to help. I mean, I am with you on this one - it's bad for both communities. 
@_date: 2015-03-10 10:56:22
I might be thinking of another fella, who definitely had two accounts. I think I am because that guy had two accounts, one got banned and then the second one had a similar but different name. My apologies for the confusion. 
To the rest of your comment, shrug. 
@_date: 2015-03-10 01:03:56
Honestly, we have banned him like...once or twice now? I don't think is his first account. I think he's on his third now. It's at least his second. He announced his move to Bitcoin with us and then a bit later returned to pump up Bitcoin. 
But...the last two or three threads have actually generated a lot of fun discussion. I'm not sure if I should encourage pumping up his pedestal but the last few have actually resulted in some informative, yet harsh, replies from the audience. Even if his stories aren't worth a read the rebuttals can be. 
@_date: 2015-11-18 16:36:16
They sold it though.
@_date: 2015-03-10 01:00:03
I hate to be pushy then but....
My request still kinda stands. We still get promotional crap on-the-regular.
Although, it's really decreased by a lot over the past handful of months except for people like Logical007...so maybe my request doesn't stand...it'll just keep decreasing own it's own. Let me rephrase - if Bitcoin blows up again....can it be a thing where the spam doesn't come back again? 
@_date: 2015-03-10 00:24:04
Hey, whatever you want to say about the community is fine. We're a group of people - not just me so I don't really take any personal offence...or feel the need to defend them. 
I am simply here to speak up, since I check out sometimes out of curiosity. Anyone who wants to come discuss investing in can do so...but we have a rule about self-promotion and the community has time and time again been really disrespectful both about intentionally ignoring the rule and responding to the members, purposefully trying to spam the subreddit, and forcing a clash of the communities. 
@_date: 2015-03-10 00:09:14
Alright. I'll poke the tiger. From a moderator at Can you all (out of the people who take it upon themselves to push the currency) please stop coming to our subreddit to promote the currency? Please? I ask politely. 
The subreddit votes it down everytime, we have an explicit no-promotional threads policy, we've banned ALL link posts because of how badly the subreddit hates promotional posts.
Can you PLEASE stop coming to and with threads like you want to have "a discussion about Bitcoin", "ask why people don't like Bitcoin", "ask if people are considering investing in Bitcoin", "discussion of new trading platform/acceptance from some vendor", asking "why equities investing is any different than bitcoin investing" and then going HAM on every single person who says they don't like Bitcoin for X reason. It's not all of you...but it's a big enough group of you. 
For almost half a year Bitcoin promotion threads were a 2-5 threads per day thing. This was also when "bitcoin", "dogecoin" and "litecoin" were on the AutoModerator insta-remove list from the subreddit. Back when regular organized "time to promote Bitcoin" threads were a thing. Back when Dogecoin was ALL OVER REDDIT with their shit. But...this also preventing people from being able to have genuine discussion about Bitcoin. About...4 months ago I removed Bitcoin from the banlist and so far it has been nothing but regretful. At least the promotional threads are down to about one per week and they are generally downvoted to zero.  
If you want to know why people think Bitcoin is dead it might be because so many subreddits banned discussion of it for a long time, because of the constant spam-siege. And it's SO HARD to justify unbanning it.

Er, well, I think you're missing the point. Let me take a step back.
Nobody promotes Apple stock. Not in the marketing sense of the word, which is how I choose to define "promotion" when I disallow it. People discuss Apple stock, and some people say it is a good investment sometimes.
Generally when I disallow Bitcoin discussion I can link that person to either 1) being new to investing in crypto and expressing a desire to spread crypto (aka the entire Dogecoin subreddit, or back when Bitcoin was more in it's EXCITEMENT phase) 2) recently buying their first or a large quantity of Bitcoin (see 3) backing or having an investment in some sort of Bitcoin related service (example, you) or 4) Having a thread made about how they are trying to promote Bitcoin (post-mortem example, you or pre-and-post @_date: 2015-03-10 00:32:20
Maybe if they came to to recommend Apple stock. Or maybe if it was Steve Jobs ghost coming to promote Apple stock. 
But really, nobody goes to and promotes Apple stock, or really any stock for that matter. There's some discussion about stock picking but even that is really limited (and not by us). It's just not a big part of the community. It isn't a thing that happens and we'd probably delete it anyway. We delete when people promote shitty penny stocks (that they obviously own some of), or their shitty investment app. We delete brokers with shitty referral codes. 
@_date: 2013-04-15 23:03:59
The proof is on you though.
Gains they will accept without proof, as they do not care. Technically you should be reporting any gains you realize through BitCoin. Gain is the amount you cashed out, less the amount you put in (including fees along the way).
If you put money in, then see a significant gain, then use the coin to purchase something then you technically should be reporting a gain equal to the current market value at the date of purchase. This also works in reverse for losses.
Losses, again, proof is on you. If you cannot prove that you put in a certain amount of money for a certain amount of coin, then got a lesser amount of money for the same number of coin then you can end up getting you loss nullified. You have to be able to prove all of those things - the number of coin being the same, the cost, and the value when cashed.
Otherwise, tax law in Canada doesn't care what the currency or property is. Unless it's LPP you have to recognize the gain or loss.

Can someone help me understand this? 
@_date: 2013-12-17 22:58:56
That's what I'm thinking. It's way wrong. It doesn't make sense really....at all. You can't combine "easier" hashes to find together to find a solution for the block. Everyone is looking for a solution to the block. This is even apparent in pools because they will give the name of whoever finds the solution.
Here is my understanding of what the author is trying to describe.
When you join a pool they don't want you to return the result of every nonce you try. They don't want you sending back millions upon millions of hashes per second. So, they set an easier level such 4 zeros. They can predict how many hashes it will require you to do on average to find a hash with 4 zeros. Every time you find a hash with 4 or more zeros you return it and get awarded a share. These shares are your proof of work to the pool that you have done some amount of work to find the block.
There easier hashes and shares have NOTHING to do with finding the actual block. When you find a nonce that meets the actual block requirement you didn't combine your work with these easier hashes. You just got lucky and found it and send the work in to the pool to collect the block. The only purpose of these easier hashes are for the pool to count how much work you've done.
