Finally got my goal of 16.000.000 $BTC. Only 1 million more to go to be in the first place marketcap

Yes, but you have to convince everybody, and that seems pretty impossible right now or in the near future

Short that shit 100x
@_date: 2018-10-01 10:35:23
I received mine months ago. Still no nudes :(

Shit, first I read electroneum and insta downvote. These shitcoins are giving me nightmares

I just lost 1 minute of my life for this. If you read reddit comments before watching a video, just don't watch this, you'll not miss a thing!

Nope, this time it's really about Bitcoin Core.
@_date: 2019-10-30 15:01:33
No one and everybody combined
@_date: 2019-02-27 07:41:11
K, thanks. Don't keep your private keys on mobile wallets or exchange. Or not open source paper wallets or software wallets. 
@_date: 2019-02-02 16:04:54
Who cares

If it wasn't written in the title I couldn't see Andreas in this. 
@_date: 2019-02-08 18:38:40
Never used blockchain.info
@_date: 2019-02-27 07:33:42
I know this is old news and they fixed it. Not sure. Anyway, don't keep money on exchanges or mobile wallets. 
@_date: 2019-01-16 20:02:28
You guys are too advanced for me. Good job building for bitcoin!
@_date: 2018-11-20 22:39:50
To be fair, from December last year until now you can hardly find a coin with return &gt; -50%. If any
@_date: 2018-02-28 17:41:35
is that time of the month when this shit is shared once again?
@_date: 2018-04-29 12:58:05
The road below will be the fork of BCH, with 32 MB blocks (and no usage) and the one above I don't know what it is, cuz BTC is at 1MB.

If suddenly you have 80% it is more profitable to re org 7000 btc in your favor than to wait to mine 7000 btc
@_date: 2018-12-28 11:24:37
It's still the best
