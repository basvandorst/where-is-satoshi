One might also need to consider what time of day this happens. It may not seriously affect the hemisphere which is in night time.

I had this issue recently. I placed two minimum bets on the 90% and one on 70% bets and then nothing happened. Just a deduction off my account. Thought I had lost with such good odds in my favour so I decided not to use it again. (Gambling is bad 'mkay). But I checked my account the next day and I had more than I had before placing the bets. 
So it just takes a little while to show up, but it does eventually.

Yeah you can create a backup of the authenticator 'key'. I did when I created 2 Auth for my BTC-e account. Stored screenshots of the authenticator keys as a backup in case my phone is lost/stolen.

Also, Paypal is one of the methods of donation. 
And we HATE Paypal.

I am also new to bitcoin, and have had my fair share of troubles getting into bitcoin. And I'm from South Africa. 
I used bidorbuy.co.za to get hold of my bitcoins. Its basically like ebay but for South Africa. It accepts a variety of payment options though. Maybe have a look at it?
