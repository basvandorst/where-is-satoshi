I've only been in bitcoin a year or so but even then it has been patently obvious to me Gox has issues. 
I saw the crash they caused last year because of their trading system, I saw them repeatedly put out a time frame for implementing litecoin that never happened and I saw them getting investigated by the US government for money laundering and having bank accounts seized. 
All these issues pointed out to me Gox was at the very least an incompetent operation with serious legal issues going on so I didn't touch it with a 10 foot barge poll. Other people could see the same problems as me yet they decided to put their money in Gox and are now suffering the consequences.

This is garbage. If you want near zero risk buy bitcoin and put it in cold storage. As soon as you put it anywhere else you are making a choice to increase the risk and you take the responsibility for your actions.

These passengers got on the SS Gox knowing it already had massive holes in it. People took the risk keeping their coins there and now unfortunately are paying the price.

BTC-E is the best exchange I've used so far. I've never had any issues with them, withdrawal and trading has always gone smoothly. 
People shouldn't just fearmonger about them when they've been around a long time and consistently performed well unlike shitholes like Gox.

Government intervention has cost a lot of people money in bitcoin already, it's not just shoddy exchanges. China crashed the price with their regulations and other countries are inhibiting bitcoin progress as best they can. 
People aren't arguing for zero legal reputations for criminal actions they just don't want masses of government red tape backed of lobbying interests who want to see bitcoin fail.

That's good to hear. Depending on the multibit classic you're using there may be an option under preferences to set the fee at whatever you want. I'm using 0.4 and it has that option.
I had an issue where it i sent coins and they weren't getting to the blockchain. I ended up upgrading to the latest version of multibit classic and that sorted it out. I'm using electrum now so hopefully there will be no problems with it.

They want to limit mass immigration from Europe. 
They want to get out of foreign conflicts.

Bitcoin does have intrinsic value. It's virtually anonymous, can be sent anywhere across the world so boarders are meaningless, can't be confiscated by the state unless you're a dumbass, requires zero storage space, can't be manipulated by governments etc. These properties give it an intrinsic value.

The government seemed to let major banks go for years who were laundering money for drug cartels and terrorists, they pick and choose who they go for. 
In the UK bitcoin was featured on a newsnight, a popular show and within a few days blockchain, the main way of buying bitcoin stopped processing UK transactions. I doubt these things are coincidental.

This is something I think should be the biggest concern for everyone. For me the fundamentals behind it's success are rock solid and if left alone bitcoin could go way higher but the number 1 problem is government/financial interest involvement. 
The more of a threat bitcoin becomes to the old guard the more likely they will be to clamp down on it. Blockchain already killed their UK operation just after bitcoin got exposure on newsnight which may be coincidental but I doubt it and the same could happen to other sites. 
As soon as a major government says bitcoin is being used for fraud/funding terrorism etc. and it's made illegal surely the price will crash and then what? How sucessful will it be if 99% of the population are too scared to use it?
Maybe like with drugs the demand will be so high people would use bitcoin despite the legal risks or maybe it will just die because the vested interests against it are just too powerful...

The system is so corrupt with vested interests using lobbyists it's incredibly difficult to effect any positive change. Money controls who wins elections. 
We would need to combine efforts behind a candidate/party with a few universal policies that alienate as little of the public as possible then put a shit load of money their way. 
@_date: 2013-04-06 04:56:07
I don't see why it really matters at this point that people are only investing in it to hoard, to me instead of being primarily a speculative bubble it actually looks like the price is just reaching it's equilibrium. Hardly anyone knows about it so the amount of money invested compared to those who could potentially get in which is basically everyone on the internet is tiny. If all the people out there who could buy into it did so because they saw it's intrinsic benefit the price would be many times higher. 
From here it will either crash at some point simply because it's a bubble with no genuine demand created because of the properties of bitcoins themselves or it will reach a much high point and then level off because there truly is value in it to people. From then on it will be obvious that it's not financially beneficial for the average person to speculate on it because the price won't fluctuate enough and people will start to spend it. 
From then it will be the transactional currency it's meant to be and flourish.

Doesn't fiat mean 'by decree' i.e. a currency has it value solely by government degree.

Bitcoin is inherently political, it is the antithesis of the the current central banking model.

People need to listen to this interview with a former world bank lawyer to understand the depths of corruption and wickedness plaguing world financial institutions: 
To me it seems really naive to think that there won't be a concerted effort to destroy bitcoin if it becomes mainstream enough, it's the antidote to the top down control corruption feeds on. 
I do think that getting involved with lobbying can only be beneficial. Just look at the gun control debate, despite the fact there appears to be a gradual attempt to disarm the American population (which has happened in many other countries) the NRA have managed to not only prevent that but actually pushed back.
I believe a lot of politicians are simply prostitutes willing to sell out to anyone, nefarious groups and benevolent. I don't think they're all simply at the behest of the banking elite, they can be used for good too.

I just see zero chance of this happening. The public are either too apathetic, too ignorant or too dependent on the current system. There is no way there will be any radical change in the political system barring some sort of financial collapse so for me the only alternative is focusing on one issue like lobbying and trying to change that. 
There's probably only a very small chance that would succeed but it's better than nothing.

The point is your definition of raging madman encompasses pretty much anyone with any life in them. There's a reason Max has made a show about a topic usually associated with middle aged men who read the FT popular with young people, it's because he's entertaining and intelligent not a raging madman.

I totally agree, these motherfuckers are cunning/powerful and will use every tool at their disposal to destroy bitcoin if they believe it's a serious threat. 
I fear they would not even need to resort to massive attacks etc. to destroy bitcoin, all financial interests would need to do is use their lobbying leverage over governments to outlaw exchanges and take the sites off the net.

What's more likely to be successful, a gradual attempt to change the system from within it or a wholesale uprooting of the status quo? How do you achieve the second? People are not intelligent enough to unify between single causes, they're intentionally divided by the politcal class and the media. 
You'd need to get basically the whole country to agree to change the current system and take action to achieve that, there's zero chance of that happening. 
The best solutions would be to try and get enough momentum behind ending lobbying, if that was out of the way representatives may actually represent the people.

You're just chatting shit. To equate reducing mass immigration to getting rid of blacks, Asians and eurpeans is insane. You act like they'll all be forcefully returned to whatever country their great grandparents came from.
UKIP plan to reduce immigration from Europe but open it up to the world so we'll have more diversity of immigration if anything just less europeans.
