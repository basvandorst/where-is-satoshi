That's a dip, not a crash... It never dropped below the 24h price. Sorry for your loss if you dumbly bought in during the spike

Gitcha, I'm right there with the. The servers crashing pissed a lot if people off. Lot of people lost money due to being inaccessible. I was in work and missed it. Hold tight folks! ��

Same exact! I was a long time user on coinbase, then one day I was closed with no reason. The only thing I can figure it may have been was having my debit card on my account as well as my girlfriend and brothers. However, there were no questions asked or conversations to be had. Coinbase said I violated their acceptable use and that's all they would say. So, onto Gemini. With experience, Gemini's much superior anyway. 1% fees, free transfers in, all limit buys. When you buy on coinbase, you set a market buy and over pay, sometimes by an additional 3-5%. Go Gemini. So far, so good.

Paxful has also locked my account in the same fashion... I have about 100$/BTC in my account when BTC was 8k:1! No reasoning, just a big red flag when I logged in one day saying your account has been suspended. Support chats and emails are unresponsive for weeks now.

3.(g) is the term that states no currency exchange is allowed per PayPal. Definitely a banable offense
