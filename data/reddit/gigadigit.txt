Got an invite also and just signed up.  Service for now seems very similar to Coinbase.

Used to many years ago.  But haven't used them for a long time.  But I am starting to use them again.

I signed up pretty early.   As soon as the site was opened for sign up.

What about what happens to otc penny stocks?  Market makers naked short shares that they don't have and they have no intention of borrowing. When very large amount gets sold (naked shorted) , price will go down a lot.   Then they buy back in to cover.  No need to borrow!

So far so good.  Got into PETA a few months back and is starting to take off.

I think it's a great idea.  You should do it.

I am not surprised that a researcher from a bank gave a low ball price target.  By putting the target at $1,300 and saying that Bitcoin's current price is already at its future potential, the banker is essentially saying it's not worth it to invest in Bitcoin anymore.  The upside potential is $1,300, but it's very volatile.  Is it worth taking this risk?  May be AAPL might be a  better investment!  If I don't know much about bitcoins and read this research paper, I will probably be investing in something else with a much higher target.
