I think you misunderstood me, criminals bought and sold bitcoin for goods and services, it is what put it in the spotlight
@_date: 2017-12-17 00:26:56
The current price point $20000 is unsustainable using the law, $1000 bitcoin is sustainable forever given the network limitations, bitcoin will never fall below $1000 as long as the network is being fully utilized.
Beyond that it is just network effect, but network effect alone cannot sustain the current price forever. There has to be real usage of the currency to sustain $20000 for eternity.
It is impossible to x2 the rate of people joining via the network effect, we would reach the entire population of the earth in 4-5 months time in order to sustain the current rate of growth and sustain it since bitcoin has reached its transactional limits. Buying bitcoin is not adoption and we would have to find exponentially more people to sustain the rate of growth seen in such a short time frame.
This is the reason I have sold my position in 5% chunks at milestones leading up to now. It is mathematically unsustainable in the long term. I am anticipating one of the worst crashes in bitcoins history in 2018 unless there is evidence that merchant adoption has risen 2400% along with price.
@_date: 2017-12-16 23:34:12
The law is best suited to compare transactions to market cap. Since bitcoin has overvalued its capabilities to transact using metcalfe's law it's clear that bitcoin is way overvalued for its network usage. 
To comfortably rely that the price is sustainable we would need to see bitcoin transact on a level EQUAL to the current price to note that it is sustainable. That there is a constant demand to keep the price at $20000 steady for a long period of time, possibly forever.
Bitcoin reached the limit of its transaction capabilities when it was $1000.
@_date: 2017-12-21 01:09:17

@_date: 2017-12-06 08:32:20
The thing is.. there is not a proper way to short bitcoin without buying it first = this is an exchange. Exchanges are net positive because shorters have to BUY bitcoins in order to short, driving prices up. Futures don't do this, it is cash settled and no bitcoin is bought in the process, there can be short pressure without buying any bitcoin which previously was not there.

If the endgame of bitcoin is store of value, it ultimately has failed. There are currencies capable on blockchain running 4000 tps (more than Visa) decentralized with less than $0.01 fees. Bitcoin needs to be able to beat this in the long term or it will become dated as a new currency is adopted by businesses and users alike
@_date: 2017-12-17 01:46:12


That implies that new users will make multiple purchases and continue purchasing bitcoin with the initial deposit they made to sustain the current price. Might be worth doing a survey to determine % of users that lump sum invest vs DCA (dollar cost average). 


The number of transactions should be x20 what they currently are to sustain the current price as bitcoin is currently implemented today. Merchant adoption should be up x20, all across the board bitcoin purchases and services should be up x20 this year to account for price increase. 
I've seen [Overstock bitcoin transactions have only tripled]( Article is a bit dated but its true across most merchants, even large adopters like Steam have stopped accepting it all together


And where are we going to find exponential number of users for bitcoin to sustain the current price when its reaching peak parabola. I'll lay out the example again with speculative estimates
750 -&gt;1500 took 111 days
1500-&gt;3000 took 94 days
3000-&gt;6000 took 76 days
6000-&gt;12000 took 47 days
12000-&gt; 24000 takes 30 days
24000-&gt; 48000 takes 20 days
48000-&gt; 96000 takes 15 days
ETC ETC.. im starting to see a problem here, how on earth is this uptrend sustainable? Eventually we are going to reach speculative mass either running out of users, or $ to sustain such an uptrend as it would have to continue at such a parabolic pace. 


I very much beg to differ, the number of transactions is slightly up from all time high. There are [140k transactions in limbo right now]( I would call that hitting transaction limit.
LN alone cannot solve the transaction problem, as it requires a rollout like segwit and a blocksize increase is still needed even with full LN and segwit 100% adoption to reach mass scale. I would comment on other details about LN but I heard people get banned for talking about it so I will not comment.

There is little volume on futures, its a blip for now, way more volume on exchanges

Bitcoin has doubled this year 4 times already
750  -&gt;1500 took 111 days
1500-&gt;3000 took 94 days
3000-&gt;6000 took 76 days
6000-&gt;12000 took 47 days
12000-&gt; 24000 took ??? its on track to take less than 47 days
To sustain this growth would require doubling of buyers for every dollar amount on a increasingly smaller timescale
2 The reason OP wants you to look at a logarithmic chart is because it looks less intimidating
3 Consistent parabolic growth, until it reaches a peak. 
4 This same mantra was used in the dotcom bubble, 'internet investments should be treated differently than traditional investments'

It simply is not enough to maintain a parabolic uptrend, it has doubled more toward the top end and not the bottom.. 
When it goes 100% on a smaller timeframe every time, it is on track to hit a peak within the next 3 months, no more than that.
No amount of corporate money can sustain a 100% increase on a smaller and smaller timescale forever. A top is going to be reached and it won't be pretty
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:03:23
Adoption is acceptance, in the use case of bitcoin that would be online merchants and retail stores as a currency. If the price rises but there isn't an equal rise in merchant sales via bitcoin in dark markets, gambling sites, online stores etc, then the price increase accomplished nothing in terms of adoption.
If anything the [rise in price is ironically causing less adoption]( in this case, as users are fed up with fees and are turning to alternatives. Majority of end users on bitcoin are speculators who buy up coins to hold on exchanges and wallets, a use case absolutely destined to fail.
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:58:28
You forgot the peak that wasn't broken for 3 years (1100) You are selectively using data from a 4 month period of time in which bitcoin has only gone up and up. There is no guarentee that the peak will be broken. Only in hindsight can you make such conclusions.
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:43:12

@_date: 2017-12-17 17:09:22
Buying bitcoin in droves is not a use case. Bitcoin is used, not as a currency or means of exchange but a speculative instrument. It has become apparent since the transactions have clogged yet the value is up x24 in that time. 
There is no longterm demand beyond this speculative rush. A $20000 bitcoin is not sustainable long term on network usage alone. We would have to find double buying power everytime it goes 100% to maintain the current growth on a smaller timeframe, bitcoins $ gains are going to roadblock in the near future. 
Since the current usecase is only a 'store of value' we increasing have to find more people to buy in to maintain the price. I already laid out an example that we would hit the population of the world in 3months time to continue the current parabolic growth and maintain it, all of these buyers old and new would have to buy with the same amount at every 100% to maintain it.
And to add bitcoin inflated 4% this year, its not even in a deflationary spiral yet.

Using log scale charts is disingenuous 
@_date: 2018-06-13 17:55:08
Bad news about bitcoin is just trolls btw
@_date: 2018-06-01 15:15:54
[Web traffic]( to crypto sites is down, and falling fast. 
The price movement is a complete joke, blatant manipulation.

*This is good for bitcoin*
@_date: 2017-11-21 17:02:31
For sure. Price posts reach the front page for a reason. That is a simple metric to guage tech vs price interest
@_date: 2017-11-26 06:48:48
Member' the 1100 all time high that took 3 years to be broken? What's to say the current price will end up being a milestone that cannot be broken. With great performance comes great downside potential, especially a currency with no intrinsic value outside what someone will pay for it. A $1000 bitcoin is just as usable as a $10000 bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-21 16:35:27
Newcomers don't know how to do that. End up paying median fee transactions. Having to check the mempool is NOT user friendly 
@_date: 2017-11-22 00:25:39
Volatility will increase, thats a given
@_date: 2017-11-20 16:12:49
Its gotten to the point new users posting their transaction isn't clearing and paying high fees, they are 'FUDster' and sockpuppet and have a paid agenda... very unsettling way to downplay a real issue.
@_date: 2017-11-24 02:09:59
 I trade the weekly swings and have outperformed bitcoin. Follow traders, fudders, skeptics, and shills on twitter for market sentiment and avoid this sub because it distorts your view as its in the best interest for bitcoin to rise. 
Recent events include china, 2x cancelation, and coin that shall not be named (auto moderated)
@_date: 2017-11-20 17:27:40
This just in: posting about high fees makes you all of the above:  fudster, paid shill and sock puppet. Please do not post about this, or we will call you a fudster paid shill and sock puppet.
@_date: 2017-11-21 16:31:54
The fees can be high for other reasons
@_date: 2017-11-20 16:28:01
The only thing that changed was the price. Transactions are capped
@_date: 2017-11-25 16:07:16
Volume usually means increased volatility 
@_date: 2017-11-24 01:35:23
Missed opportunity to buy BCH, too much risk.
No signal to buy BTC. Be patient
Likewise: Do not listen to strangers for investment advice.
@_date: 2017-11-24 01:39:04
Buying bitcoin is speculative in the first place. More fun to play the market
@_date: 2017-11-21 16:50:02
As the price rises the risk goes up and the reward decreases. Its actually getting less attractive as the % gains decrease. People are only in it to make money.
@_date: 2018-03-03 23:01:31
You were claiming earlier that batching is the cause of transactions  down, yet that has been debunked given the active addresses  are down, so you state that a rush of money came in Dec? I'm not even denying or claiming that.
@_date: 2018-03-02 22:50:00
Active addresses are down though
@_date: 2018-03-03 17:06:53
"December media rush" now that is rich. (# of active addresses down 40%) This is good for bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-02-12 22:00:49
For every successful product there are multiple failed products that never get brought up, because ultimately they failed.
Many of these failures only become clear in hindsight
@_date: 2018-02-12 23:54:50
In no way does this apply to bitcoin, you can't bring up past tech successes and claim that bitcoin will apply in the same way. Bitcoin is not universally adopted and it still has room to fail. Its such a poor argument 
@_date: 2018-02-05 07:29:57
To add on


Blockchain is secure. This isn't unique to bitcoin


As valuable as the current supply and demand.


Can hardfork more junk altcoins


As long as there are altcoin pairs with bitcoin, sure. There is a real demand there. Exchanges are adding more USD pairs. Buyers are not going to trade USD-&gt;BTC-&gt;ALT, but instead USD-&gt;ALT making bitcoin irrelevant as time goes on.
@_date: 2017-10-28 00:18:54
Your divisive language isn't changing anyones opinion on the matter. 
@_date: 2017-10-30 01:15:47
Wait for -35 to -40% correction. Happens every 2-3 months. 
@_date: 2018-02-11 22:45:45
Survivorship Bias
@_date: 2017-10-22 22:39:00
Disdain for those in your community will not get you far. Bitcoin should be able to reach everyone, not a select few. There are clear barriers to entry that will prevent that. If you agree that bitcoin isn't for everyone which Samson Mow does, without any calls for solution, I personally do not want to be involved, as that was what made me excited about bitcoin
@_date: 2017-10-30 01:26:13
Bitcoin is not currency anymore. It is a commodity. You are paying the premium to use the most decentralized blockchain. Thats what gives bitcoin value
@_date: 2017-10-23 01:07:23
Agreed, It does feel crazy that agrees that bitcoin isn't for everyone! A weird change of pace from  the space back in 2014. Times have changed for the worse, not happy at all. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 02:24:34
Just wait for the -30 -40% correction that happens every 2-3 months
@_date: 2017-10-30 01:28:57
Bitcoin is the new gold. Its no longer used as currency and now is a store of value.
@_date: 2017-10-22 22:01:38
Thank you for showing your true colors! I'm sure the folks in third world countries, which usage is rapidly growing, would be glad to hear they aren't cared for in the bitcoin community!
@_date: 2017-10-28 00:16:56
"Please don't use bitcoin" Market will see it for what it is. Bitcoin is becoming even more unattractive as time goes on. 
@_date: 2018-07-18 16:16:49
Willful ignorance
@_date: 2018-07-26 22:35:47
News that comes out is not manipulation. Not one word about all the positive news coming out, now its manipulation when the price goes down! Sheesh
@_date: 2017-10-30 01:29:44
This, use bitcoin cash for cheap transaction. Bitcoin is for storing $ only
@_date: 2017-10-22 19:58:01
I can assure you no context is missing, he doubled down on the statement in reply and as recently as Sept 3rd.
@_date: 2017-10-22 17:56:46
[Samson Mow]( has a history of being a toxic voice of the community. 
@_date: 2018-07-18 15:02:44
A [report]( estimated only 0.04% paid taxes.

Turns out being your own bank is difficult. SFYL
@_date: 2019-05-27 13:16:46
Well bitcoin is an excel spreadsheet people are willing to pay $8800 per coin to use, madness really.
