You say "temporary" a lot - but these are all things that people have been saying are temporary for a long time now.
Until grandma can buy eggs at the grocery store with bitcoin without getting confused, losing her coins to hackers, or having to understand public key cryptography and deflationary economics, Bitcoin will be strictly a "nerdy tech guy" thing. I can't see that reasonably happening where people are in control of their own private keys - which means intermediates will pop up that abstract bitcoin, and will have to charge their own fees to do this. I can't see that being any better than existing credit card merchant fees.

A lot of different things:
* Absurd get-rich attitudes/cognitive dissonance of the majority of folks on this subreddit
* Stigma from high-profile black markets
* Downplaying the difficulty of actually using bitcoin and security issues
* Waste of computing power/electricity
* Volatility
That said, I still find the technology compelling, but I don't believe it solves enough problems and ends up creating new ones. I can see technology similar to it replacing things like bank wires, but I don't see it being used long-term in retail settings.

well you're actually effectively getting charged fees on all sides... prices at most online stores are set with the assumption that credit card processing fees are part of it. Unless stores deduct that additional cost for bitcoin users, or scale the exchange rate accordingly (most still price in USD and convert to BTC), you are effectively paying for a fee that the merchant then just gets to keep as pure profit.

right, you pay fees either via a transaction fee or a higher exchange rate to get USD into BTC, then you pay a bitcoin network transaction fee to transmit BTC to someone else to make a purchase.

Say two similar hotels have rooms for $100. One hotel decides to set the rate to $80 and charge a $20 fee per night. Expedia.com lists the $80 hotel and the $100 side by side. You want your hotel to stay competitive, so you have to do the same thing.
Caesars tried to stand their ground by advertising loudly how they didn't and wouldn't charge resort fees, but that didn't work for them. In the face of bankruptcy they caved and started doing the resort fee. Everyone else will eventually follow unless some sort of law gets put in place making it illegal, but it never will because the casino/hotel lobby here is way too powerful.
I think it's terrible, but if you want to stay in business you have to play the game.

that's just the character repesentation (hexidecimal) of it. The target value is actually a number between 0 and 2^256, or roughly 1.157920892e+77. Difficulty is calculated by taking that maximum value and dividing it by the current target, which is currently ~1.7275516e+60 (0x0000000000000113370000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 in hexidecimal). This yields the current difficulty of 15,605,633.
When one speaks of "leading zeroes", it's really referring to leading zeroes in binary. Think of the target as a string of 256 1's or 0's. the number of zeroes at the front of that number is what we're talking about.

Say three people pay you 0.5BTC each, giving you a total of 1.5BTC.
You then want to buy something that costs 1.2BTC, so you create a transaction sending 1.2BTC to someone and the remaining 0.3BTC back to yourself.
This transaction has 3 inputs (the three .5BTC transactions you received) and two outputs (the seller and your change address).
Remember, you just have a private key (that is linked to a public key -- your bitcoin address) that allows you to prove that you can spend funds from previous transactions.

the biggest problems with bitcoin that I see are:
1) It offers no real advantage for consumers for day-to-day spending than cash or a credit/debit card - it's just more complicated. It's easy to dismiss this if you are tech-savvy, but think of the dumbest person you know. This could probably be improved with better POS terminals, etc.
2) Getting money in/out of bitcoin is still way more difficult than it needs to be
3) You can't buy hardly anything with it - and the incentive for merchants to accept it is low given the volatility and the fact that all of their bills are in a different currency. Instant conversion back to dollars kind of defeats the point if you ask me.
4) Most people view bitcoin as a money-making scheme, hoping that the value will rise dramatically due to the design-limited supply. If you're always thinking in your head that 10 years from now a coin will be worth $100k, there's a lot of pressure to not spend today. If the case for bitcoin was really cheaper, faster, better payments, there would not be so much focus on speculation.
@_date: 2013-11-26 21:41:24
It is amusing to me that on one hand people want bitcoin to get them out from the clutches of government, and then on the other want the government to protect them when they buy something that became less valuable between purchase and delivery. BFL has no control over bitcoin difficulty or the USD value of BTC, and you were never promised a firm delivery date.
Further, if BFL had the ability to deliver in a timely fashion, you would not have been making 5BTC/day anyways since everyone else who ordered would have theirs as well, drastically increasing difficulty.

As long as you set reasonable limits for yourself and you enjoy doing it and have self control, I don't see there being any problems with it. It's a thrill of risk vs reward like anything else in life.

It's a lot more transparent than most other gambling situations so in that regard you could argue it's a better bet than other things.
