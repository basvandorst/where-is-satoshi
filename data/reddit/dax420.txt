I can't get onto btc-e right now. Hope they are just busy from everyone panic cashing out... I have a lot of money tied up there right now.   
EDIT: back up

Google the concept "priced in"
The current market price has already taken the "Chinese shit" in to account.

Don't care what happens to Gox. What I do care about is what will happen to the price if they announce bankruptcy, and what will happen to the price if they resume withdrawals.

It's 50 cents for those too lazy to do the math.

Well you win some you lose some. I threw $20 into btc-e for shits and giggles and "day traded" it up to $23 in a couple of hours last night. If you watch the charts long enough you can see patterns develop.    
It's now worth $25 since I let it sit in BTC all night, but whatever.

Damn man. Day trading BTC is already volatile enough. Doing it on margin... Seems like a poor decision.

The Chinese are buying to circumvent capital export controls and move funds out of China.    
How about that?
@_date: 2013-11-21 21:25:55
The most Chinese statement ever made.

That would be the worst way to do it. If I wanted to cash out $14million I would do it privately, not via an exchange. Cashing out via an exchange would crash the price making your assets less valuable. You need to find some rich guy like the Winklevos twins and do a straight up cash for coins trade though a legal firm who provides escrow.

Last trade on BTChina was 6400 Yuan or 1050 USD...

Great product. Do you post on ?   
You should consider cross posting this success story there, to get more small business onboard with taking BTC.

I wonder if you could hire a hypnotist to recover the password from your unconscious mind... Now that would be a story...

Capital gains in Canada are taxed at 0.5 your standard tax rate. There is a box on your T1 return for capital gains, and the math basically goes "take the number in box xyz and divide it by 2 and then add that number to your yearly gross income"

Explain?   
You may not have access to that email, buy you can still login with your email address as the username and transfer BTC to your wallet, no?

I think you mean is an impostor troll.

Just because we don't know how much is in the ground doesn't make it infinite!
@_date: 2013-11-21 18:59:16
Does "highly selected" mean "racially profiled"?
@_date: 2013-12-19 20:07:27
Yeah yeah, everyone here is stupid except for you.    
I made $500 swing trading yesterday while everyone else was losing their shirts. Guess I must be gambling.
@_date: 2013-11-22 19:26:10
Math fail. You would be a ten thousand-aire.

Question: What exchange do you use? I've been wanting to day trade BTC but the orders take so long to execute at the moment that I'm afraid the lag would wipe me out...
@_date: 2013-11-19 00:28:26
I don't think you understand how an exchange works. If the last "buy" on MtGox was $780 that means someone paid someone else that price for BTC. It doesn't get more real than that.
@_date: 2013-11-21 22:10:07
What kind of problems? I've been using it for a few days and it so far so good...
