Individually the components of bitcoin have existed for a long time, so its nothing new. 
Its like inventing a cake, then saying, we dont like cake but we love eggs and Flour.
Well if you love eggs and flour so much why dont you shove them up your fucking arse!

Dunno but beginning to think that 75c is a decent investment
@_date: 2016-11-29 18:56:57
nah, I dont agree, how can you ever pay 0.0000x for something. i trade and its damn confusing for me to work it out between currencies
@_date: 2016-11-23 21:16:26
Not really, it just goes against the philosophy that some here hold
@_date: 2016-11-25 20:34:45
it would be interesting to setup a mirrored network that replicates transactions from mainnet. run it in parallel to see how it performs and roll out all new features as they are developed

Good to have you back Charlie
