Gotcha. Definitely keep us posted on what happens. 
@_date: 2014-05-23 01:43:35
Awe man. I guess that rules me out if it's restricted to 21 and under. 24yo here. 
@_date: 2014-01-05 19:22:58
coinbase.com would be a better choice then Gox.
@_date: 2014-01-27 02:44:06
Damn.. That sucks.. I would definitely contact bitpay about it. I would guess they can help. 
@_date: 2014-04-25 18:35:48
Well yeah, obviously. I would be willing to bet more then just me would be using their bitcoin to purchase things that they normally may not have though. I know that would definitely be a bit of a game changer for me when I am deciding where to order things.

A wacky bunch of propeller heads.
@_date: 2014-04-25 16:03:12
They would have just gotten $600 worth of business from me last night if they did.

Glad to hear someone else in Milwaukee is a bitcoiner!
@_date: 2014-01-27 01:20:38
Did you have your tx fee turned off or something?
@_date: 2014-06-06 17:44:13
If you haven't already you may try posting this in to get some more interest.
@_date: 2014-06-06 02:28:37
Happen to have a rough idea of where it's gonna be?
Me and a buddy or two are interested and would be coming from Milwaukee, WI.
@_date: 2014-06-24 18:35:31
How much did you end up mining with them?
@_date: 2014-05-23 00:46:16
I have yet to attend a large LAN party. This happens to be just close enough that I could. I'm going to keep an eye on this. Do you have a site or anything for this?
@_date: 2014-04-26 00:00:24
I mine all my coins. If I can spend my coins directly instead of converting them to fiat and then buying it's much less hassle on my side and saves me a fee or two.
@_date: 2014-04-28 18:35:16
Awesome to see places in Milwaukee starting to accept bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-10-24 05:35:14
YOU BROKE IT!
@_date: 2013-04-24 21:46:11
where can i find this? i'd like to know how close they are to shipping mine. 
@_date: 2013-05-16 21:44:17
can confirm. put 0.60btc in and now the site redirects. kind of pissed... glad i didnt put more in though i guess..
@_date: 2013-04-27 07:58:48
this would make me very happy but i don't know about it happening all too soon given amazon bought woot out.
@_date: 2013-06-22 02:24:05
there are invoice numbers though for when you have paid. do you think maybe they are going by those?
edit: a word
@_date: 2013-06-14 21:44:14
this would be a cool idea I think. whether it would actually take off, i do not know.
@_date: 2013-09-01 22:35:32
Coinbase is super easy.
@_date: 2013-07-10 05:49:43
from what i've heard you're going to have to wait it out. refunds are no longer available as they are shipping all product lines.. however slowly that may be.
