There are miners that publish their blocks inside the great firewall? Why would they intentionally try to orphan their blocks?

You realize no sane miner would actually publish blocks inside the great firewall, but rather set up a stratum server in a well connected country like Japan?

All hail our leaders!

I won't reject it. I'll use this version. So can you if you'd like bitcoin to scale.

The reason for 75% is so that one large pool can't veto the change (this is written in the BIP).

Scaling roadmap just kicks the can. Thankfully Roger Ver , coinbase and other major economic players are more forward thinking.

You mean the blockstream gang?

This is actually bad news for xt, so it's ok!

Supposedly for getting transactions unstuck by replacing then with a higher fee. A terrible workaround for small block size. Its main use will likely be to swindle merchants with double spends. (Send tx to them, then send the same coins to yourself with a higher fee)

So it was discussed only in the echo chamber? No wider community or developer input? :-(.
@_date: 2015-11-27 21:38:27
I agree that that's how it should be, but you're wrong.

For The Reference Client it is

They are not clearly marked as such in any wallet that I know off. How do I tell if someone is trying to cheat me with RBF transaction in breadwallet?

Community/developer consensus

You keep stating bogus statements as facts. This merge makes things clearly worse. It's upsides (bump fee) is clearly outweighed by its downsides (more technical complexity for everyone, more user error prone, going away from satoshis original vision -- just to name a few.)

It's not opt-in for YOU! It's not opt-in for the merchants. It's opt-in for the miners -- and all it takes is one big miner to opt-in to make 0 conf a lot less reliable (read broken)
@_date: 2015-11-28 18:03:30
No I'm not. I'm not free to not use it. It's not even an opt out for the receiver.  I don't even know if I'm using it. Now I have to go beg the breadwallet devs to implement detection of RBF transactions so I know if someone can easily cheat me. Thanks for the extra complexity and yet another thing to remember to be aware off when accepting Bitcoin.

Bye bye 0 conf :-(.
