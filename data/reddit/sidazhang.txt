WARNING - The link below links to the fraudulent site
I took a look around, everything is an exact replica except that their /wallet does not work!
Click on this link (WARNING FRAUDULENT SITE): 
 
It just opens up a blank page with the directory and does not serve any HTML.
Looks like these fraudsters aren't even good at phishing

For those who are not familiar with OP_RETURN. It is going to be in the upcoming v0.9 release which makes OP_RETURN (allows you to create immediately prunable output to attach message bytes) a standard transaction output in Bitcoin. And when does get released we will move to use OP_RETURN instead of creating messaging outputs.
I don't think that this is issue, because this project will never generate enough transactions to matter in the slightest bit to the size of the blockchain. However, I feel the project is important to demonstrate a point which is this:
Bitcoin as a programmable currency protocol has enormous potentials beyond just sending transactions. And OP_RETURN (when it does become standard) has important implications for smart contracts, using Bitcoin transactions to prove / transfer ownership. The objective of this project is to raise awareness in that area. And make developers realise the potential in a fun way on Valentine's Day.
At most, I would say using hash160 output to attach messages is not an elegant way to do this compares when OP_RETURN does become standard. But I believe this awareness that we generate is far more important to Bitcoin development.
We did have plans to move to OP_RETURN but We previously decided against because we felt it might take too long for the transaction to get confirmed and wanted to at least wait til there is at least 50% pool market share that mines OP_RETURN. (right now it is at around 39%)
On a second thought, 39% seems acceptable and I would definitely think about move this over now instead of waiting for 0.9

This pretty looks awesome. Looks really good on the mobile!
@_date: 2014-09-14 01:27:04
Why not use a hardware wallet?
@_date: 2014-05-16 14:45:39
Is there a video that someone can link me?
@_date: 2014-10-14 16:21:52
This is awesome. I really love the security setup. How does the backup actually work?
How come I can recover the master seed with the backup link feature even if I forget my words. All the other client-side wallets say that if I forget the seed I lose the wallet
@_date: 2014-02-13 20:07:49
It is usable now. But it is not mined by BTCGuild and Eligius. (please correct me if I am wrong)
And they combine contribute to 39% of the mining pool which means it will take on average 2.5 times as long to get confirmed.
That's why decided against it. But now I am thinking that maybe it doesn't matter. So I could switch in the coming days
@_date: 2014-05-28 01:22:39
I am not sure if this story is real at all.
Can someone from bitpay confirm this?
@_date: 2013-12-11 18:11:04
We definitely been thinking about that. if there things you would like open an issue  or send me a message!
A few friends and I are always working on open source projects to make the adoption of bitcoin easier and less friction. Check out our [projects](
@_date: 2013-12-24 00:17:33
Thank you for the shoutout! This is awesome :)
@_date: 2013-12-11 22:19:04
All of them are your addresses :) and so all of them work!
Check out this wiki page on more detailed explaination on addresses
You get money into it by sending it to an address that you wallet generates!
@_date: 2013-12-11 20:28:04
Thanks! and if you have any feature you would like open up an issue or tweet at me  :P
@_date: 2013-12-11 18:15:07
Agreed, definitely got to be doubly cautious if the app was closed-sourced or obfuscated. 
@_date: 2013-12-24 00:19:28
Nice! :)
Contact info wise. This project is open sourced so the easiest way to find us is 
or 
hollar @ us over twitter, I am 
@_date: 2013-12-23 17:17:44
nice! :)
@_date: 2013-12-24 00:20:11
haha nice! Definitely sounds good. Although I am under the impression that facebook API is a little bit harder to work with. It is like twitter where there is an open stream
@_date: 2013-12-23 17:55:30
If anyone has any feature request: 
And if you want more semantics over what is accepted: (for example, 1 Internet corresponds to 1.337 USD worth of bitcoin). 
Make a suggestion over our parser
@_date: 2013-12-23 18:49:26
haha nice! Thanks GeekyCreeper! :P
@_date: 2013-12-11 17:50:19
hey Jratcliff, this is sida, one of the developers working on this extension. I completely understand! haha given how many bitcoin sites got hacked recently. I would be super cautious too! :)
Obviously, I am biased (spent a lot of time writing this), but please check out the code and if you think it looks fine then experiment like 2 dollars with it, create issues/feature requests on github, make a pull request! :)
@_date: 2013-12-23 23:57:38
Thank you for your thoughtful comments. This is already in discussions. 
Please feel free to jump in and share your opinions too!
@_date: 2013-12-11 17:35:09
hey vqpas, this is sida, I am one of the guys developing this extension. Could you please clarify when you mean by "they might be able to read private keys from the screen, change a bitcoin address in the clipboard"
If you were referring to security of the extension. Our project is open source, we personally use it and the source code can be found on github
@_date: 2013-12-11 17:24:55
Hey Bob, That's a good question! All the code is open source and can be viewed on [github]( But to answer your questions:
**Storing private keys:**
We SHA256 your "password" and use the digest as an encryption key to encrypt your private keys and those private keys are stored in chrome extension storage. They keys are only decrypted when you send a transaction.
**Propogating transaction:**
We use the blockchain.info API (blockchain.info/pushtx) to propogate the transcations. The way it works is that we will make an API call to blockchain.info for unspents and then build the transaction and sign it inside chrome extension. We will then serialize the transaction and propogate it. Your keys are always only inside your browser. And always encrypted (only decrypted when signing transaction, and that still happens on the client side)
**Why not offline app**
Sparecoins is meant to be a quick and easy way to make bitcoin transcactions on the web. If you want an offline app to store a large sum of bitcoin, you could always use the desktop clients. But how clunky is it to fire them clients up just to send a small bitcoin payment!!
@_date: 2013-12-11 23:26:13
addresses are not one time use. But because they are so easy to generate, its good practice to have new addresses. For example, in our app, each time you make a transaction, we generate one new address for you as a change address :)
@_date: 2013-12-11 21:43:20
This is done via chrome storage. The keys are encrypted by AES and encrypted keys are stored in the browser. when you login, your sha256 of your password acts as the decryption key to send payment
I imagine a vulnerability might expose the encrypted keys, but the encrypted keys are useless, unless you dedicate an insane amount of computing power to brute force it. 
We haven't yet thought of another vulnerability. Although, we take this seriously and really want to hear your thoughts on further improvement on security.
@_date: 2013-12-11 22:33:28
No worries about the question at all.
You can use the export function which allows you to export the encrypted private keys. Unfortunately, you will have to then use AES to decrypt them yourself. Which is SHA256 of your password as the decryption key
@_date: 2013-12-11 18:05:28
Chrome extension has very good sandboxing and security. But I understand anything could happen but in the event of a breach.
This could only happen if chrome store gets hacked and malicious updates gets pushed to the chrome store. But if that happens I guess any chrome extension could be compromised.
To improve security, we have a spare computer that is almost always offline to store secure information.We use that to push updates to the extension so that even if our personal computers get compromised the extension will be still be secure. (Obivously we are the biggest users of this extension and are very cautious :P )
I am interested to hear though, what other areas that this could be compromised and what could we do?
@_date: 2013-12-23 17:51:40
Hahaha! That was the original name that we picked. But some squatter was sitting on the name!!!
@_date: 2013-12-11 18:07:50
No unfortunately, chrome extensions don't run on iphone chrome :(
@_date: 2013-12-11 21:39:45
hi mshadel, That is a very good suggestion. We have actually seriously considered that.
Currently there is a logout button, have you tried that?
@_date: 2013-12-11 18:07:29
haha! thanks!. honestly, the inspiration was exactly that. We were on a website and wanted to make a small donation. But the process of opening a billion things WAS just too clunky. Plus it would be more secure that you primary storage of bitcoin is separated from the account that you frequently open/close/and make day to day transactions. So then we decided to build this for ourselves!
@_date: 2013-12-23 18:27:17
The short answer is I am not 100% sure. 
But the bot listens for either  or  If your account is set as private, the bot would not be able to see your  tweets but should be able see  which means the transaction should go through.
To try, you can tweet this " test", you should get a response from the bot asking you to authenticate. If you do, then it should be ok
@_date: 2013-12-24 00:23:48
Actually, we were inspired by reddit tip bot.
A few weeks ago, we built an open sourced browser wallet ( and we posted it on reddit and got a bunch of tips with reddit tip bot. That was very encouraging for me. (The fact that people liked it enough to send us a tip!!) And so we decided to build this tipping service (open sourced, ofc!) to encourage supporting other projects.
@_date: 2013-12-11 21:45:20
That is correct. Although I would recommend you to first get a full featured wallet to hold the majority of your fund and transfer an amount to the extension. Think of the extension as a purse and not as your vault.
All the addresses in the extension are generated within the chrome extension on the client side so the extension is fairly sandboxed.
@_date: 2013-12-23 18:48:00
Hey Giszmo,
I am glad you asked us these questions. 
You can find us   on twitter. Hollar @ us anytime. (tbh, we both have a fairly heavy footprint on the internet, not hard to find us :P )
Our project is open sourced and so you can find us on github too. Since it is an open sourced project, it is intended to be maintained by the community and for the community rather than something that we charge for. 
Server wise, we are hosted on heroku. Two people (scott and I) have access to it. Keys are encrypted with AES-256.
Scott and I have had discussions about storage policies. If the site gets popular, and if we hold more than 5 BTC in aggregate, then we will switch to cold storage. But the underlying principle is that, this is not a wallet and if anyone deposits a large amount of BTC we would ask them to move the deposit to a trusted cloud wallet provider.
@_date: 2013-12-11 22:58:57
Definitely would be nice. 
Basically, sha256 of your password and then use AES to decrypt the exported private key. 
you can try the javascript library 
@_date: 2013-12-11 20:24:41
hey why not open an issue on github @ 
Alternatively, you can tweet at me 
@_date: 2013-12-11 18:17:18
And if anyone finds any problems please submit a github issue!
@_date: 2013-12-23 18:56:42
You are correct. Although I want to take this suggestion onboard, I haven't made up my mind about whether to actually go with this.
@_date: 2013-12-23 18:50:29
Awesome stuff! Thanks for the feedback. 
If you want more semantics / units of measure, like 1 Santa / 1 Goblin / 1 Smoothie whatever you can think of :P
open an issue on github :)
@_date: 2013-12-11 20:27:19
Thanks mshadel! 1MTdy3kHGnuM9ARPWfSyAHPS8jdXf5kJJk
Really appreciate it :)
@_date: 2013-12-23 19:57:19
very nice ideas.
Btw, there is a history page if you view your profile!
@_date: 2013-12-23 16:54:42
Hey xrandr, I think that is a valid point.
The answer is no. Transactions are sent and recoreded in the blockchain. As a tipper or the receiver, you do actually have your own "wallet".
@_date: 2013-12-23 19:18:33
The reason is that the blockchain acts as a tested and very reliable backend for storing transaction history and so our app's responsibility becomes only handling encrypted keys.
And at a small cost too (6 cents per tip). 
@_date: 2013-12-23 18:51:53
You do! You can ask people to ask people to tip you with 
@_date: 2013-12-23 20:39:39
to be honest, we never took Dogecoin seriously. But with every single Bitcoin project we do, we keep getting Dogetcoin requests. We are now actually seriously thinking about it!
Out of curiosity, what about Dogecoin that is so appealing over Bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-12-12 04:38:47
I think being cautious is always a good idea, especially in Bitcoin! :)
@_date: 2013-12-11 18:08:44
Hey 3pence, Could you please take a screenshot and submit an issue on github? 
@_date: 2013-12-23 18:54:13
We have actually done quite a few bitcoin projects. Some of our previous projects include sparecoins.io which is a client side chrome extension wallet! Check us out at github.com/BitcoinMafia/
