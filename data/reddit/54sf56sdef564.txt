Correct, we live in an era where something can go viral and obtain millions of users in literally just  a few days.  has claimed that Changetip went viral.  However, that's simply not the case.  If Changetip went viral it would have obtained hundreds of thousands of users in a few days.  It would have been trending on Twitter, Youtube, and made its rounds on Facebook to where my grandma would have asked me about it.  We'd have likely seen references to it on the Tonight show or one of its equivalents.  That's viral.  This is not the case with Changetip or bitcoin.  If you want to see something go viral, look at Snapchat who had 100+ million users in just a few years.  Or take tablets or smart phones which got 1+ billion users in their 6 years.  Bitcoin simply is not taking off.

A billion more people and the infrastructure is already in place.  The internet grew 15x faster than bitcoin AND people had to buy a computer, an ISP, and software to run the internet.  Bitcoin can't even get that many people to download a free wallet, let alone purchase bitcoins. 
In 2 years more people purchased computers, ISPs, and software to runt he internet, then have downloaded free bitcoin wallets in 6 years.  But do go on about how the internet is being outpaced by bitcoin.  Too funny.

Title is click bait bullshit, perfect for this sub.
HTTP went live in 1991.  By 1993 it had 14,000,000 users. Bitcoin has under 1 million users.  Venture capital is not indicative of growth.  
Edit:  Look how fast this sub upvotes blatant lies to the front page.  LOL.  This article is comparing early 1990s growth of internet to bitcoin.  Super awkward reality is that the growth of the internet in the early 1990s was 15x faster than bitcoin.  All this article is implying is that a whole lot of VC investors lit their money on fire.

Nobody is singling bitcoin out, they are giving it similar regulation as fiat has.  Regulations prevent things like Mt. Gox from happening.  Like it or not but having regulation to create a barrier of entry for businesses weeds out shady operations and you are left with more legitimate establishments like Coinbase and Circle.
Despite the extreme fringe belief here that regulations = Hitler, it's quite literally the opposite.

Jesus christ this community is such an echo chamber it's not even funny.  One guy posts a picture of an Uber driver with a QR code and now this is at least the third article about Uber drives and bitcoin tipping.
Reality check:  There's probably under 10 people in the world accepting bitcoin tips as Uber drivers.
