Nope, I have and like NEO, BNB, XRP, NANO, and a few others

Everything that's not BTC is a shitcoin...?

Any asset is valued at what the market (e.g. two people, or even two billion people) is willing to buy or sell it for. If, over time, they continually agree it's worth more and more, then yes, the demand - and therefore it's value - have gone up.
However, let us not forget the sword can cut both ways and they can also continually agree it's worth less and less over time.
In either case neither is "right or wrong"; it's simply what they (the market) felt the asset was worth at that time and place.

Umm.. actually there's a big difference if you don't sell at your 4X threshold.. You have a better ROI
@_date: 2019-07-04 00:00:42
The choir should be banks instead of alts. BTC and shitcoins can coexist. Remember 2017
@_date: 2019-07-04 00:21:36
Shit, yeah, totally forget ETH. Everyone should have a long-term ETH position too.
@_date: 2019-07-04 00:42:57
Correct. (Current price - base price)/base price = ROI

If you're not 100% confident in your ability to create a secure wallet, keep your machine 100% free of malware, and never, ever lose your private keys/passwords, please use a hardware wallet. 
You will never forgive yourself if you lose a substantial amount of money cause you fucked  up on any of the above.

They have kiosks in various malls around Seattle. Check here for closest location

Whales are in that car in front of you laughing at everyone else behind them, and they'll decide when Rocky is gonna go. Just watch out they don't throw it in reverse and run you over leaving you rekt

No shit... Just tax on crypto &gt; fiat. Problem solved.

How revolutionary would it be if ***this*** was in fact ***it***... the beginning of a long-term bear market for stocks and the beginning of a new, long-term bull market for crypto?

That doesn't mean one can't offer a better return than the other though.. But yes, agreed it's is all speculation right now.

Hahaha, "coinbasing" is actually a verb now... Awesome.

They probably said that about wireless tech when that was first invented too

That is 100% spot on! He should be a fund director

Was your last "post" (from seven months ago) really about finding a book where you're a squirrel and die?
Sorry man, not even gonna get into it with you.

Totes. Competition in this kind of environment is excellent. OP, do as was previously mentioned and drop your name/what you're doing on here every once in a while; just not too much or you'll see lots of down votes which will actually hurt you.

Re those old school movies... Cinema to VHS, oh yeah- high quality stuff right there. Ultra HD 4k... pfft! Lmao

Not to dissuade you cause I think you have a great thing going here, but how's this different from Ethlance- other than the obvious that yours is BTC and theirs (District0x) is ETH?
@_date: 2018-02-16 18:46:45
Precisely. And I think that adoption this time around (e.g. blockchain) is going to happen a lot quicker than last time (e.g. the internet) because we didn't have the internet to facilitate and connect the world like we do today. Information travels at never-before witnessed rates in today's world. I love it.
@_date: 2018-02-16 16:54:54
Crazy that was 24 years ago
@_date: 2018-02-18 20:10:09
Happily, I agree with this.
Sadly, I don't think most of humanity is smart enough - or has the proper resources - to effectively utilize and take advantage of it before the oligarchs and tyrants take it over and maintain their control. 
Shit, a lot of people are probably looking up oligarchy and tyranny right now cause they don't know what it means...

You are verbatim repeating what the guy is describing in the video link I posted @ 45 seconds in... "Everyone believing this time it's different".  I don't think we've hit the real "bust" however; we need real money - institutional money - involved before we'll see the actual bust.
Not to worry though, digital currencies **are** the future so all will end well when the dust has settled.

Touche my friend, touche.
@_date: 2018-04-20 22:06:03
Gonna have to agree with you on that "coming sooner rather than later" bit.  My reasoning being that the advent of the internet and it's adoption didn't have the benefit of having an already-established global communication system- which in this case we do have, e.g. the internet, so adoption will likely happen as you said "sooner rather than later". Or at least much quicker than the internet was adopted.

There's no way whales are keeping $5M, $10M, $50M+ on exchanges unless they're actively trading it- and if they are, they won't be whales for long. lol. A fool and his money are soon parted.

I prefer the Nano S
@_date: 2018-04-19 15:20:41
Good point. So there really is no *true* way to have a fully "3rd-party independent" private key then? That kinda sucks.
