And, just out of curiosity, if it goes to zero, are you okay to handle that ?

Isn't the whole point of crytpocurrencies that you don't have to cross your fingers?

Says the 3 day old redditor that has made a bunch of comments but only about bitcoin.
Seems legit..

This is simply not true.

Yes, Bitcoin is just a bunch of speculative garbage.

Well actually ..


However, we should understand that Bitcoin and other digital currencies are in the unregulated space and should be regarded as very risky assets. Virtual currencies are subject to high volatility and **their prices are entirely speculative**. Banks should measure the risk of any holdings of digital currencies in their portfolio accordingly. Right now, digital currencies are not subject to a specific supervisory approach. Work is under way in the Single Supervisory Mechanism to identify potential prudential risks that these digital assets could pose to supervised institutions.

I'm guessing they want to make sure banks don't hold crypto, but yes, not regulation.
But it is the exact opposite of what the parent was claiming, "they also want a piece of the cake". Unless you think "prices are entirely speculative" is something the EU wants in on.

I'm not sure what the purpose of highlighting was; it isn't a quote from anyone within the ECB or EU parliament - it's just whatever *newsbtc* came up with. If they repeat it a hundred times, does it become true ?
The ECB/EU can simply block fiat banks from exchanging with cryptocurrency exchanges and then what ? How do you get your money converted back into fiat currencies if the exchanges are blocked ? Or will that be the spark that launches the bitcoin revolution and all businesses start trading solely in bitcoin ?

The whole quote was:


In other words, European banks aren't interested in buying crypto but due to the development of futures contracts, might end up holding some and the ECB will keep on eye on that .. presumably to ensure they don't do that accidentally or otherwise.
If Draghi thought there might be some utility/value for the EU, why would he say the below ?
