Your best bet is to research a low cap altcoin, grab one good project with decent devs and working tech and buy that, something below 20m market cap and not far from its all time low and then wait.
@_date: 2017-12-05 09:12:54
I hope neither of those catch up. Simple, catchy, straightforward, Satoshi is enough. Besides, the way price is going, everything will be quoted in a few Satoshis soon.

Coinmarketcap lists several new scam coins on a daily basis with laughably inflated caps from people in the "team" owning most of the supply. also the vast majority of coins have no liquidity. Dominance should be against coins past a certain volume or liquidity threshold.

[Took Bloomberg five minutes to write this stuff after the dump. They were just waiting for the chart screenshot.](
What the hell?

It is the other way around, the squeeze happened 4 minutes after the article came out and apparently they added the screenshot within minutes. 
Thanks to for pointing that out.

Wouldn't it work both ways? if someone was trying to launder money then selling and withdrawing yuan would paint a target on their backs with the pbof looking through the microscope.

Me, as part of the laymen portion of the BTC community was expecting a well written response to every point in Hearn's blog so that i could be more informed but that didn't happen.. just a post to discredit a person or group. Not to mention the title sounding like what someone in middle school would write.

same boat here.... 4 hours since it was sent from an exchange and it still zero confirms... exchange says they paid the correct fees...
EDIT: finally picked up by a block ... 1 confirm after 5 hours. Not complaining - just never had that happen to me. 
These are other small payments made that I noticed have no confirms after 11 hours.

it is easy to LOL about it when you're well in green.

FWI there is bad distribution in ICOs and then there is MTL. They had a countdown for the buying to begin but it was sold out 20 minutes prior and even if you had tried before it was 'sold out' your tx would be rejected. Oh yeah then they thought 'maybe if we sell the general public a bit, they'll forget about tje countdown' so they said there would be another round of buying but capped at $2,000 per person for 'bettah distribution'.. greed was so overwhelming that they canceled that too.
