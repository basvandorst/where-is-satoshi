No, I'm out of trading the revolutionary technology. I still like bitcoin, and intend to use it in the future. Just not trade it.

For the avoidance of doubt, I'm not using gox. bitStamp was down today, and so were many other exchanges down, at least intermittently.

Correct.

The fact they're doing sweetfuckall to prevent it tells you everything you need to know about what will happen when they reach 51%.

I'm not even on mtgox :) stamp was down too. You just don't hear too much about it because there are far fewer users there.

Hi, their message is fishy, here's why:
I hear they used rails, so a zero-day on a site like this wouldn't be unheard of (there have been plenty in the last few months). Fair enough, hacking does happen. Here's what you'd do:
1) immediately turn off the live site and run forensics
2) at the same time, deploy a new live site using the same deploy scripts and the zero-day addressed (the rails community has been fairly good at this) 
3) your btc daemon surely was raking the coins to a cold storage account every few minutes, so you immediately rebuild the db and refund the coins to new addresses.
So it may even be what they are doing now. Except - it doesn't take 90 days to do this. And you certainly wouldn't need to ask people to submit requests - because the hashes for the URL would just be remapped to new addresses in the bitcoind. 
UNLESS - of course - you thought it was time to cash out on a service with no apparent revenue stream (0 fee transfers may I remind you) - and stole everything to dump 6.2 mill on mtgox the same night - leading to a dip in the market. 
That said, I'm only speculating, we may never know what happened for sure. It could well be they just want to rebuild the site in a different language they trust more with better security, however I don't see why they wouldn't just announce it?

How could they not have the pkeys, it's impossible to send without them.

Actually these are automated replies everytime a zendesk user raises a ticket.

I'm a self-aware botnet and I disapprove of this post. Keep mining.

This is the part where you go 'oh' - as you realize the other exchanges are no better once under load.
