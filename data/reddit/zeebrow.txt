&lt;unmentioned coin I own&gt; isn't speculative...

If you increased the blocksize to 1TB, wouldn't that just mean that the only people able to mine blocks that large are even larger pools?  Because if so, that just means that larger blocks discourage decentralization.

I'm glad I saw your comment.  I've just recently wrapped my head around how crypto, the blockchain, wallets, keys, etc work, and soon I'll understand fees and block sizes and how they relate to mining.  Can you decide to not make a transaction if the fee is above a threshold?  Because it sounds like a wallet could be designed to do that.
Who are the fees paid to anyways, the miner who gets your tx?

The article misattributes the recent rise in Bitcoin to geopolitics.  IMO the author just lost credibility.

I just discovered IOTA yesterday and am still becoming entangled with the concepts ^^^sry
I really want to integrate it with openHAB

Start by asking yourself why it is not profitable for you to mine bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-09-12 14:35:19
I mean, you gotta connect to the internet somehow, right?  What's the alternative?

I'm actually going to take your side real quick and add that I think there is a problem with how bitcoin is mined.  Mining is the epitome of centralized infrastructure.  The way I understand things is that when I want to transact, I have to get a miner to hash the block that my transaction is in, i.e. I need a third party all over again.  There are some interesting Etherium products that I could see changing this in the future.
But back to the point, I think that "Bitcoin is not a bubble" (I have faith in bitcoin) because:  
1) I understand enough about how it works to get excited about how it may be utilized in the future.  If I were alone in thinking this, then wouldn't exist. 
2) I don't trust the government, at all.  I have libertarian political biases.  The goverment does scummy things to give the dollar its value.  I see you're a very bright 5 year old, so maybe you can help me understand this:  It benefits the government to be in debt so that it may sell it's own debt.  If you, an investor, want what amounts to a guaranteed ROI, you buy US bonds, i.e. give the govt your money *now* and they'll pay you back plus interest *later*.  The 2% you make off the bond after maturity has less value than the money than the government made by accepting your money because of inflation.  Inflation can be influenced (by the same government that borrowed your money) so that the 102% you just received is actually worth *less* than the 100% you paid for the bond, even if you have a higher *number of dollars*.  Put another way, it benefits the government to accept your loan for $x and spend it *now* because its value is greater than the $x+2% that you get paid back *years later*.  
3) I have more but I need to go and make more tinfoil hats before I go to sleep.  Suffice it to say that bitcoin is not the real answer here, it's the concept of the blockchain.  Bitcoin is just one implementation of it, albeit perhaps the most important one for now.

Right, like it is right now (if they buy btc).  
I'm just saying that an ISP could provide a means for increasing the value of bitcoin whilst collecting bitcoins themselves.  It's a win-win for the bitcoin community.  So the difference is that you're increasing the value of bitcoin by 1) transacting in bitcoin and 2) incentivizing growth of bitcoin infrastructure through discounted/enhanced services for full-node managers.

Yeah let me just throw all the money I'm willing to invest into my fucking Coinbank account, all at once, the day after an ATH.
@_date: 2017-09-18 11:29:33
Oh, great point.  If the market did well, I might not buy for the same reason.

I'd argue that the tech is most certainly evolving.  I got involved right after the BCH hardfork, which is a significant technological development.  Now Segwit stands as the most recent stride towards the "ideal Bitcoin."  
One reason that we don't see tangible technologies stemming from bitcoin is because bitcoin (or some other better coin) needs to develop in order to be feasibly adopted by prospect applications.

Gotta hand it to them, they know the hodlers out there may have some disposable income.
@_date: 2017-09-21 14:16:36
I wonder if it's beneficial to have a bunch of bots spam request many small transactions as opposed to one large one.

Coinbase also lets you link a bank acct if that's an option.  Honestly though I'm not sold on coinbase yet - it's a wallet that sacrifices control and (potentially) privacy in exchange for ease of use.  At the most basic level, all you need to do is 1) get a wallet and 2) put coins in it - since 2) sounds like the roadblock, I'd start here, from the sidebar:   where I found this: 
Technically I guess you could use Coinbase as a wallet.  It's just a long string as an address to send money to that looks like: "12g2bmbpkY7yf948ekWb1UnBA6jkEYMdSy".   That's mine, and I can paste that in plain sight without worrying about someone accessing the BTC there because you need a private key to make a transaction (  Private keys are what connects any wallet to its rightful owner, and are meant to be as securely protected as humanly possible.  I guess Coinbase "takes care of my private key" for me, I have no idea what it is.  When you get a wallet, I believe a private key is generated for you.
I don't know *nearly* enough to make any recommendations, and there is a lot to learn.  Right now, I'm looking into hardware wallets that support SegWit as a starting place, and eventually use it as "cold storage" to keep my BTC off of any network.
That's probably more info than  you wanted but it's my lunch break and I'm on adderral.

Sorry to be that guy, but I get it, McAfee likes Bitcoin.  It should be no surprise that he's bullish during a dip.

That's me.  Bought $50 USD worth yesterday, using plebbase, just to get my feet wet.  Crypto is going to be legit and I'm going to be a part of it from now on.

Question for you dollar-cost-average investors:  Do you simply automate a purchase at the same time every day, or do you take a fixed amount of money and buy once per day when you feel the price is best?  
I feel like doing the latter kind of defeats the purpose of DCA.  But in the end you will still be "averaging" so long as you invest the same amount of money every day.
