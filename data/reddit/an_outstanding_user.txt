All their gold reserves got "stolen" during the USA managed coup. They must be desperate

Wow, what a rip-off!

You are free to trust corrupt agents and unjust judges. I won't. That was not even a fair trial. There's many info out there, judge yourself
Ross mother said in this video that they had control of the DPR account. For what little I know, they had complete access to the server and could have tampered anything. They won't disclose any of this info and resort to parallel construct
The "DPR" nickname is also relevant, I guess it was chosen because like in the novel, DPR were many people

I agree power, money or necessity or even threats, can corrupt everyone. That's why we need systems everywhere in society that eliminate the possibility of corruption.
With something like openbazaar in this case with anonimity and reputation systems, there wouldn't be a Ross or those agents

Please excuse my poor English. Silk road was in the hands of corrupt agents and they had the ability to forge anything they wanted, they had control of the DPR account and could have fabricated any messages too. I wanted to make a short title saying that the jury was not presented all of this information.
I found more info here 
And the jury should have been presented all of this information, the judges and accusation blocked everything

OK I just wanted to share this info, that's why I say judge for yourself. Excuse me if I sound harsh in English. I have followed DPR case from the beginning out of curiosity, but just on the surface I guess, I'm sure there's much more we don't even know.
Like connections between agents in Baltimore and from mtgox, he was very interested in the case too, maybe it's all connected, i bet he has a gag order and the CIA took all the bitcoin!

More info about this:
This is amazing, an example on the "war on drugs", everyone is corrupted. Governments do not want rivals.
The people of the USA should have learned by now of the Iran-Nicaragua-Contra scandal where the CIA was selling drugs to it's own people (mainly to destroy the black community with crack cocaine), selling arms to its "enemies", killing people and fighting democratically elected governments in Latin America with paramilitaries.
Markets should be decentralized, anonymous and with a reputation system. That should work and it is coming. I wonder how the will fight that.

Yeah magicaltux, corrected thanks.
During the trial I think it was said that Karpeles had reached an agreement with agents from Baltimore, and that same department was involved in the silk road investigation
Maybe he got caught in something and he bought his liberty with all the money "hacked". And now the USA government has a great chunk of bitcoin in case the petrodollar fails.
blink 2 times if its true! (Like that american prisoner blinking in Morse)

You are funny
@_date: 2015-07-03 03:57:08
You are being judged by a popular jury for what you type on a computer. In this case you only lost imaginary worthless internet points.
It could be worse, Ross sentence was life on prison, without being able to defend himself and explain everything to the jury on a fair trial.
Anyway, don't despair

Talks about historic crisis, how they follow a cycle of 7 years that could be related to the Jewish shemitah tradition, and how many major events are planned for this autumn.
Everyone informed should have noticed lots of suspicious things going on. I hope he's wrong too

If you look at the IMF tactics, in other countries and times, you can see the pattern.
Debt means complete control, and also that the greek puppet government will sell all its assets cheap now
IMF destroys every country it touches.

Obama is just a puppet to entertain you, he has zero power to decide. I really can't understand how that corrupt government still stands, and why the people in USA don't overthrow it, they must be busy with the Kadarsians. And what's more shocking are the options for the next 2016 popularity contest, the same "democratic" dynastic families again?
USA foreign policies are so wrong and cruel that they have benefited Putin's popularity
Anyway, fuck Putin right in the pussy, and Obama too. Neither government should be supported, they are tyrannies

Do realize every country suffers this nowadays?
Look what's happening in USA, major cases of corruption and pedophilia, and the media won't say a thing: 
State indoctrination is everywhere too, from schools with flag and allegiance worshipping and chants, to most films and tvshows that are pure military propaganda. Recent FOIA documents show the military and diverse state agencies, "collaborating" in movies and tv shows, and that's just what they are willing to admit. The list is really big, they will put the helicopters and toys if you let them alter the story and portray them favorably, buy they have been involved in more simple films like "karate kid"
This "collaborations" started really early, when films were being made about gangsters and famous interesting "action people", like bank robbers. FBI and police then wanted to be the heroes in movies. Quality in tvshows is at an extreme low, latest "Quantico" TV show for example, is just pure infantiliced and bad adoctrination
The CIA and Hollywood series:
