I agree that cash is losing relevance (though I think physical tokens in some form will always be desired for some things), but I don't think that's its a battle between bitcoin or cash, and I dont think bitcoin needs cash to disappear to be relevant.
Bitcoin is relevant on its own, the blockchain solves the trust problem, the distributed miners solve the single-point-of-failure problem, and it's virtual nature offers a really good way of conducting transactions across a large distance and/or anonymously.
These are real tangible advantages to bitcoin that make it relevant. They don't necessarily make it a sure thing, but it makes bitcoin relevant. It doesn't need to be better than cash at buying a beer at a bar, anymore than a helicopter needs to be better at getting me to work than a car.

Then the bartender serves someone else and asks you to wait while your transaction is confirmed, and you have a queue of about 7 people standing around waiting for their transactions to confirm.
Or you could just pay with cash.
I think you really have to have an intermediary payment provider to make it work effectively and quickly, something like Google wallet or Paypal. The reason a credit or debit card works quickly is that *even if* you double spend or don't have the money (but the order goes through), your CC company / bank has a record of the transaction and can chase you for it.
With pure bitcoin transactions, if that happens the blockchain simply rejects or erases the transaction, giving the bar no comeback. Meaning they either need to eat the loss or they need to wait for confirmations. The whole advantage of bitcoin (trustless distributed blockchain with no central point of failure and impossible to doublespend after confirmations) doesn't offer anything in a bar setting that cash doesn't already.

Sure you can, the bitcoin protocol can be written down and explained in a textbook, in the same way any other protocol is, say HTTP. It's a documentation for a way to do something, which people can implement if they want.
The implementation for HTTP is you putting a website on a webserver and giving it an address people can reach. If you took your website offline though, HTTP doesn't disappear.
Bitcoin is an implementation of the Bitcoin protocol, as is every other altcoin. Any one can disappear tomorrow without affecting either the protocol or any of the other implementations.
I suppose if we are thinking in more political terms, then yes if Bitcoin the implementation doesn't get any take up, then the protocol would suffer. 
This has happened in the past: Google Wave was a new protocol based on the superior XMPP that was aimed at superseding SMTP, but not enough people used it. So still today everyone uses an email address instead of a wave / XMPP address.

To be fair, even on here there seemed to be an equal chorus of 'don't invest what you can't afford to lose' vs. 'holding anything in fiat is riskier than holding it in bitcoin'.
I think it was very easy for people to buy in, in fact people were scared of *not* buying in if they read here such was the hysteria 'to the moon' etc.

You're not buying Bitcoin the protocol though, you're buying Bitcoin the implementation. You can support Bitcoin and not support Bitcoin, oddly enough.

It's more like 
'We've invented the car! This is going to revolutionise everything!!'
'Awesome... but the other week I was trying to hike around this park with my car and it got stuck - looking for solutions to drive my car round my regular hiking trail as there were three other people with stuck cars too and it got a bit congested'
'Maybe if we added legs to the car... or what if we added a propeller so it could float over difficult terrain?'
How about we just use cars where it makes brilliant sense and then *walk* where it makes sense to walk. Bitcoins make brilliant sense online or where there is distance (e.g. its solving the fact that you cant trust someone online or far away). 
They don't make sense in person where you don't need to trust someone because they can physically give you redeemable tokens (cash).
@_date: 2014-01-13 11:27:51
The idea is you register, and use sms (which can be transmitted via mobile phone without the internet) to initiate and verify transactions.
It's basically how mPesa works. 
The infrastructure behind bitcoin is fundamentally dependent on the network, which means it and the internet are indivisible. But there's no reason that you need to conduct a transaction on the blockchain in real time, you can use payment providers or whatever. 
Wouldn't be surprised to see paypal jump into this space - you set up a paypal account, add your bitcoins, then use sms to send some balance to someone else (this is already built into paypal, just not the bitcoin balances yet).
@_date: 2014-01-03 12:10:36
Absolutely right.
You take your phone to the bitcoin ATM and withdraw some local currency and then go and get wasted.
- everywhere accepts cash already, don't have to try to find bars that accept cash
- fastest payment process, instantly verifiable by the bartender
- impossible to double spend, bartender doesnt need to trust you as they have the cash in hand
- have to queue at an ATM
- it might be raining

I'd say bitcoin is more like a linux distribution than email.
SMTP is a standard that was publicly developed with a Request For Comments published by the Internet Engineering Task Force. It was then used as the one single standard for email, so that everyone uses that single standard.
Conversely bitcoin was developed to solve a problem rather than create a standard (like linux) and is used and developed not as a universal standard but by interested parties (like linux) and people are free to choose alternatives (like linux) but there are some clear advantages to using bitcoin over the existing alternatives (like linux).

You have just come up with a more elegant solution :)
But I can definitely see use cases for transferring small amounts over facebook.
@_date: 2013-12-04 10:45:09
It's more like sending cash in an envelope to someone's mailbox... it's not secure because anyone along the way could steal it or break into your mailbox.
But for small amounts it's not a big deal. "Here's 20mBTC, go have a nice time at the cinema tonight - love Dad"
Then again, I'm sure people can come up with a more elegant solution.

Yea I think it's value is in distance transactions. Fiat and paper currency already exists and already works well for in-person transactions. I don't know why bitcoin advocates think they need to 'beat' fiat as the currency of choice for in-person transactions. What's the point of the blockchain when you can physically verify with fiat that they haven't doublespent (the cash is in the register!). It's not a problem that exists the same way in meatspace.
For remittances is works really well technologically, but it has to compete with other services (as it has to be converted through two exchanges, the local and the foreign one, whereas Western Union and other money wire services are single organisations with more efficiencies) that may have lower costs. But this remains to be seen.
As is of right now, if I want to send £1000 to Nigeria, I can buy 2.13BTC here, and sell it for [actually there is no way to sell in Nigeria, I can only exchange for dollars] $1597, where the exchange rate to Naira is 255,839. 
If I had transferred direct from GBP through western union I'd have a secured and guaranteed service my relatives can collect in cash with no further effort - and receive 255,971 - MORE than if I'd sent them the 2.13BTC that they'd had to try to sell to someone.

Well maybe, maybe not. I don't have a crystal ball :) - I accept it's a real possibility that a future altcoin could be so superior to bitcoin that it usurps it.
I think the best attitude (for me anyway) is to accept that my knowledge is limited and things I cannot possibly imagine will change the landscape in ways I cannot predict. The future is unknown, and so we just use the limited knowledge we do have to best hedge our bets.

e-gold is asset backed (by gold) so everyone's 'coupon' is redeemable for gold in the case of a crash. It was also a centralised system run through this guy's site. You could only trust it as much as you could trust the guy.
Bitcoin is not asset backed (its only worth what we believe it's worth) - it's value is in the technology. It is also decentralised completely - its peer2peer, which means that unless you control over 50% of the nodes it's impossible to cheat / defraud the system. You don't need to trust anyone in particular, you just need to trust the system.
One major pitfall that e-gold had that bitcoin hasn't had to contest with on a major scale yet is the requirements of anyone buying or selling bitcoin as a business must comply with [Know Your Customer]( laws. Some would argue the anonymity is the exact point of bitcoin, so laws making it a lawful obligation to break open the anonymity could threaten bitcoin at some stage.

I would say sell on localbitcoins, should be able to achieve £600 per BTC currently.

Don't feel bad - the market prices things to reflect *risk*. When the first bitcoins were being mined the expectation that they'd ever be worth anything was infinitesimal - hence why people almost threw them away. If people were confident that it wouldn't flop, it would have been worth more.
All you can do is make the best choices you can with the information you have. Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose. The nature of the game is zero-sum; so either you gamble and go for the ride, or you believe your intelligence or knowledge to be superior than that of the market and you can more accurately price the security. Behavioural finance actually advocates avoiding glamour securities - because people tend to overvalue them.
With bitcoin, it's a novel type of security, to the extent that almost nobody understood whether or where it would be realistically priced. Even now really, it's risky business.
@_date: 2013-11-30 07:37:05
Yes. Bitcoin depends on faith. Who (except people who already hold bitcoins) would have faith it a system banned by every bank. The protocol would still exist but the expectation of future adoption would collapse meaning all the speculators would panic sell meaning the price collapses proving back to the masses that it's unusable as a currency and repeat until its just another note in history.

Chip and PIN is pretty ubiquitous in the UK too, but most stores are geared up to accept cash or Chip and PIN. Some (very) small shops don't accept chip and pin as they don't have the machine / licencing set up from the bank.

A 51% attack - where if you control over 50% of the mining power you can edit the blockchain effectively.
At this point its a hypothetical problem rather than a practical one - but if you had to redo bitcoin from scratch you could certainly engineer it so that large mining pools didn't have such a disproportionate 'power' over the network.

Perfect advice. Bitcoin *is* really exciting and I've been watching it closely, but I would never risk my entire net worth in it.
@_date: 2013-11-23 10:36:40
Doesn't it work the same though because it's deflationary? So everyone's bitcoin holdings are, in a way 'pumping bitcoin' proportional to the amount of bitcoin they currently hold, as the number of bitcoins is fixed then deflation is the same mechanism. 
If all dollars in existence = 1 apple pie, and all bitcoins in existence = 1 apple pie, the difference is when there are two apple pies and we double the amount of dollars only the person printing the dollars gets wealthier, whereas for bitcoins people's wealth appreciates in proportion to the amount of bitcoins they hold. So if you had 10% of all bitcoins, and the economy grows by 15%, you 'claim' 10% of that 15% growth as your own slice.
I could be wrong though?

There are people who don't want others to be diligent, because they can make money off of others blindly throwing cash at bitcoin. The more it frenzies the more money they make.
The real answer should be that you probably shouldn't hold a significant portion of your net wealth in bitcoin simply because it's a highly speculative commodity right now.
Tell your brother to imagine he has $3500 in cold hard cash in his hand. He can walk away with that now. How much is he willing to invest - with the possibility of losing - in bitcoin?

The consensus shifts to bitcoin being worthless, nobody accepts bitcoin and there is no incentive to use it.
If one person held 100% of bitcoins in the world, would someone else trade that person to have some? No. It would be no different from any other pre-mined altcoin.
If one person held 100% of water/oil/land/gold/apple/amazon/usbonds would people trade to have some? Yes.
Bitcoin has value because of *consensus*. We *agree* that it is valuable. But there's no fundamental reason we *must* agree that it's valuable. That's the reason it could go to $0, in the same way nobody bothered to continue using Google / Apache Wave, even though it was clearly superior to email. If only one person in the world used the superior protocol, it doesn't mean shit to anyone else.

If you wanted to do that there would be no reason to hold bitcoin. You simply wait until you need it, buy some bitcoin, send it / spend it.

This is what scares me a bit. That there's a blind faith almost on here that 'the reason people have concerns is because they can't see what I can'. The amount of times we've had it reposted that 'people who don't support bitcoin don't get it'. That's mania-speak.
Bitcoin has huge *potential* but it's only hindsight which will prove that, a lot of the most vocal (who downvote every slightly critical post) believe it's already a done deal and throw around valuations of $100,000 a bitcoin etc... if that was guaranteed then the logical route would be to continue to borrow money and buy bitcoin until it hits $100,000 per coin.

If there are fewer mining pools, it means most of the confirmations are being done by the same few pools. This makes it easier for malicious agents to take control of the network.

The market price is a fair representation of it's value.
It was cheaper three years ago because it was riskier.
It's still risky, but less so, so the price has risen.
Think of it like roulette: the odds have gone from 1 in 38 to 1 in 12, so the return on your $100 investment (if it pays out) has dropped as well.
I think bitcoin is definitely worth a punt - just look at the press it's getting. It could go up big. Then again half the reason it's getting so much press is that everyone who has bitcoin is talking about it everywhere as that in turn drives their own wealth up - which is exactly what the European Central Bank warned: 'it has all the hallmarks of a ponzi scheme' - whereby the current 'holders' keep saying how good an investment it is to get new people in so they can sell later.
Have some fun and buy some, but be prepared to lose them. Don't invest more than you are willing to lose. I think it's got some way to go (just my gut based on what I've read) but, it could crash to zero at any time. There is no guarantee anywhere that it won't.

Ignore the haters, a lot of people expect everything for free.
Nobody complains when you go to a restaurant and pay $50 for something which cost $10 or less to make. People pay for the chef's time.
You are le chef, and as you've pointed out people are welcome to cook at home ;).
One thing that's curious though is why have denominated your price in dollars instead of BTC? If you are selling internationally people have to work out what dollars is to them, whereas you could just have one bitcoin price, say 129.99 mBTC.
