"Buy at ATH, panic sell low," I always say!

Superman 2, right?
@_date: 2017-12-24 00:04:10
Bah! You're right, I looked it up. It was Superman 3!
@_date: 2017-12-24 06:02:06
Haha, don't sweat it man. It was a poor attempt on my part too! Happy Hodlingdays!
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:30:35
Well, its almost 17k, so you may be pretty unfucked tomorrow. HODL!

If you're an ancient Egyptian, maybe it's a pyramid scheme. Where I'm from, it's called a mansion scheme.

I know, I'm saying in Office Space they say that what they're doing is the plot to Superman 3. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 01:18:33
I don't think it's Ghost Rider! In the movie you're referencing, they compare their scheme to the plot of Superman 3!

Lol, you don't have to regurgitate outdated info to me, I've done my research. Good luck on your campaign, dude!
@_date: 2018-03-23 02:25:35
Right, because burying my head in the sand = calling out trolls and whiny babies who have clearly done NO research apart from latching onto the teet of one article. And my head in the sand = not joining in your campaign of bitching about something that's already been discussed to death on this subreddit... got it. You picked the wrong soap box, my man, deal with it.

Right, but a community is going to get pretty sick of the same story from 2013 being spammed over and over just because BTC didn't move as expected.

You're right, we should have known that the solution will be found by 1 whiner and 9 redditors exhausted from seeing the same thing posted 100x in 2 days. Specifically the solution will be found in the comments of this, the 101st time this has been posted in 2 days.

This story and posts like it have been posted about every 20 min for the last 2 days. If you do a search for keywords "abuse, blockchain, etc." you'll probably get some results. Many of these posts are being deleted, due to the obnoxious rate at which they've been posted. This story is 5 years old. It has resurfaced at a time when BTC was supposed to be shorted down to 6k, but instead rallied past 9k.

Not a conspiracy theory, fact. If you've read any of the posts by the 30+ dipshits who've posted this EXACT same "concern" in the last 2 days, you'd know that this has been a paid FUD story. If you're really that concerned, continue to educate yourself on the topic instead of jumping onto the troll dogpile.

Did you make this? It's really good.
