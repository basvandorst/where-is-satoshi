Can't use it rn, how fast are transactions and what are the fees like for the test transactions?
@_date: 2017-08-20 19:43:01
I'm just more concerned about using all these coins as actual currency. Many many places currently don't accept bitcoin, I highly doubt we will be able to use all of the coins together in the near future. As far as I know, bitcoin cash isn't really accepted anywhere (nowhere near as much as bitcoin), and I don't want the same to happen to the segwit chain or 2x chain. 
@_date: 2017-08-31 16:47:22
Ah, okay. Thanks.
@_date: 2017-08-21 00:02:37
I thought Segwit was backwards compatible resulting in no fork?
@_date: 2017-08-20 20:41:16
So segwit was going to lock in anyway and people just tried to rush 2x early? 
@_date: 2017-08-22 15:56:53
So instead of having each transaction go onto the main blockchain, they can go to a smart contract instead, which completes a bitcoin transaction off chain?
@_date: 2017-08-22 16:10:37
So this doesn't update the blockchain until after the channel has been closed. It just allows for small channels that require signed transactions (which is their way of confirming its legitimate). If everyone was to theoretically only use lightning, would there be no transaction fees/confirmation required? What would happen to bitcoin mining? 
@_date: 2017-08-31 16:26:14
So how the hell is it so big if you have to pay so much money to use it?
@_date: 2017-08-19 08:47:56
So I should buy Bitcoin after segwit activates. What about Segwit2x? Or is it too uncertain? 
@_date: 2017-08-17 21:28:25
@_date: 2017-08-31 16:09:24
Is there a way I can purchase the bitcoin directly to my wallet in the future?
@_date: 2017-08-17 20:35:14
Wait, I use copay, do I have to change wallets again?
@_date: 2017-08-17 15:19:28
I don't trust people, not with purchases over 100 USD
@_date: 2017-08-20 18:27:53
Why are we not waiting for Segwit to activate before we look at 2x?
@_date: 2017-08-20 19:33:40
If segwit is successful, do you think people will still follow through with the agreement to create another alternative coin? After all, 4MB max should be more than enough, is 8mb really worth the risk? 
@_date: 2017-08-20 19:34:14
Ah, that makes more sense. 
@_date: 2017-08-22 15:50:31
Thanks! 
@_date: 2017-08-17 14:11:18
Not in the UK.

Beginner here, does this mean I can no longer use copay with regular bitcoin? If so, how do I switch wallets? I'm having trouble using the private keys I got from copay with electrum.
Edit: Figured out how to switch wallets.
@_date: 2017-08-17 14:22:05
I don't want to use local bitcoins though, I don't want to go through a person to get bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 06:22:01
No, Windows 10
@_date: 2017-11-20 05:58:16
Fuck, I just sent massive transaction to my electrum wallet that isn't showing up, and this is really not helping
@_date: 2017-11-20 19:32:18
Thanks, the lack of segwit + no custom fees is a killer for me.
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:47:59
Please crash so I can buy more.
@_date: 2017-11-30 05:24:03
Not every coinbase user can use GDAX though. My coinbase account, which is verified, doesn't verify with GDAX and customer support has been useless. So I'm stuck with coinbase.
@_date: 2017-09-01 14:43:17
I was not able to purchase bitcoin without submitting drivers license, which from what I understand is biggest part of coinbase. 
@_date: 2017-09-28 15:20:43
I wish I could, I can't verify identity with GDAX, only with coinbase, which makes no sense
@_date: 2017-09-01 15:05:52
Are you based in the US?
@_date: 2017-09-01 14:41:50
So if I wanted to transfer BTC from coinbase to a private wallet I could transfer it to a GDAX wallet and then send it to my private wallet without the ridiculous fee? 
@_date: 2017-09-01 18:48:07
Do I need a GDAX account to do that? And how do I transfer, I just send it to a bitcoin address of a GDAX wallet or do I need to link accounts or something 
@_date: 2017-10-07 01:26:25
Should I move my coins onto coinbase before the split so I can easily sell? Or is it just as easy to get access to my 2x coins using Electrum?

Pretty sure the actor for Hamilton was actually from Epic Rap Battles of History
@_date: 2017-07-08 05:09:42
Alright, I tried formatting everything a bit better since my first question is somewhat complicated.

Thank you for your response, I'll probably just make a new copay bitcoin wallet with a new private key. As to the nicehash response, GPUs don't degrade that badly (at least from what I've seen so far) and why would I not be making as much money as I'm losing to electricity? Are you referring to the cut of the money nicehash takes?
