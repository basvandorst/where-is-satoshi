Methinks that a lot of people in this thread need to read up on the history of deflationary spirals.

The problem with deflation is it tends to compound itself - that is scarcity of available currency means people are reluctant to spend which makes currency more scarce with makes people more reluctant to spend and so forth.  It's not something that's easily modulated.  
My beef with bitcoin right now is that I don't know if it's possible for something to be a growth investment and a currency at the same time because the two have somewhat contrasting goals.

The influence of mining is a factor but it is not **the** factor.  The deflationary pressures are greater than the inflationary pressure of mining and probably will be for the forseeable future.  Mining can't keep up with the new demand.

It isn't inherent but it probably will continue for an indefinite amount of time which is basically the same issue.  As long as the demand outstrips the production of new units, the deflation question will exist.

You say this based on...?

Before you can do that, you'll have to successfully argue why and how the whole world should move away from a consumer economy.

Precisely.  A lot of people (including myself) aren't rejecting bitcoin completely, they're rejecting it as a suitable mainstream currency in a consumer economy because it includes disincentives to spend.  I look at bitcoin now like Twitter in 2006.  Which is to say it hasn't really found its niche yet and people don't quite understand where it's going to fit in the landscape of its competition or if it's even going to have a place once the initial buzz dies down.

The chargeback "incentive" is not a removal of risk.  It's simply transferring the risk to the consumer.
@_date: 2013-12-02 17:31:52


But why do chargeback policies exist in the first place?  It's to protect the consumer against fraud because the threat of fraud acts as a disincentive to spend.  So while it may be a boon to merchants to be freed from the risk of chargeback, that risk will be shifted to the consumer which may act as a disincentive to use the currency.

I think the problem is that there's no singular argument for or against Bitcoin.  There are people out there who suggest that all fiat will shortly become worthless and therefore, Bitcoin will be the place to be.  I think that is the target audience for Krugman's criticism.  Then you have the "Bitcoin as a payment processor" crowd who spend a lot of time feeling persecuted because of the existence of all of these arguments against Bitcoin without realizing that criticism does not necessarily apply to their application.  And there's probably a third group that is knee deep (or higher) in bitcoin speculation and will latch on to any prevalent theory that they believe could accelerate mass adoption and, consequently, the appreciation of their assets.  This is probably the group that will respond in the most vigorous manner to any criticism of the system because they have the most to lose.

But how do you control the money supply if you can't create more bitcoins outside of mining?
