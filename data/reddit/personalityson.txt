So energy consumption+difficulty+number of miners are dependent on the price? If the price falls, fewer people are mining, difficulty adjusts itself down, total energy consumption goes down as well.
I thought it was the other way around. I thought the price was rising to keep up with energy costs.

At what point between now and 2020 will it no longer be profitable to mine Bitcoins, because of energy costs?
If we are currently at ca 0.14% of World consumption (31.96 TWh), at 10% (2300 Twh) the price should be 850 000 USD (May 2019).
By that time only large mining pools are left, and centralization of BTC is inevitable.

It's less than that. Bitcoin market cap is normally defined as current price x all BTC.
The problem is the current Bitcoin price is only true for the 5% early sellers, after that its a black void.
If you think all BTC holders can cash in their BTCs for 7100 USD -- you're a clinical idiot.

Somalia pretty much has no taxes, no health care and no education, no police and no courts.
Instead Somalia has clan organizations and amputation of hands as punishment for stealing etc. If you're outside the clan, anyone is basically free to kill you -- literally.
To be a libertarian these days is equal to taking a trip down to Somalia and try to explain to the locals that they live much better and freer lives than people in the West. (For normal people in Somalia of course it is the ultimate hell and they do every effort to get out of there.)

@_date: 2017-11-07 14:11:30
On top of this, think about all potential BTC users out there who don't have BTC yet vs people who own BTC at this moment. The share of the former is probably 99% vs 1% of all possible users.
70-80% of all BTCs are already mined and in circulation. So, basically, 1% owns 70-80% of all possible BTC wealth. How will this grim imbalance even out if the BTC slogan is "hodl"?

Let's say every BTC holder has 1 BTC each. Do people really think they have the equivalent of 7400 USD (current tick) on their hands?
Imagine everyone cashing in their BTC... who will be giving you 7400 for all those BTC?
The price of 7400 USD is true for maybe the first 5% of early sellers. After that it's a black void.
BTC Market Cap is not all BTCs x current price either, more like a quarter.
@_date: 2017-11-03 09:33:26
You can't cash in large amounts of BTC without affecting the price itself. Looking at the frist 100 open buy orders on Bittrex, you can currently sell 33 BTC for an average of 7190 USD (highest bid is 7300). Selling 100 BTC will bring the price under 7000 immediately. Bittrex is not the only exchange of course, but just to illustrate the point.
Some whales have thousands of BTC, which are probably worth half of current price -- when it comes to realized value.

What would happen if Bill Gates bought all bitcoins?
@_date: 2017-10-23 07:54:37
Bitcoin will never become mainstream because of extremely skewed distribution of Bitcoins -- huge amounts of BTC concentrated in hands of few people who bought early.
Think about how many people in the world who could potentially use and own Bitcoins. Currently we have already 15 mill BTC in circulation owned by probably less than 1% of all potential buyers. Does it leave 6 mill BTC for the rest of 99% users?
On top of this, in real world money gives incentive to create and be productive. In the world of BTC, dorky nerds become rich out of nothing. So far, some dorky nerds are speculating and "sponsoring" other dorky nerds who bought their BTC earlier, but at some point it will be evident that the remaining 99% of potential users are not going to "sponsor" the early buyers, who own 70-80% of all BTC wealth.
The road to BTC acceptance is the opposite of hodl -- sell, but it will not happen, or at least it will take a long time for these 15 mill BTC to spread out.
