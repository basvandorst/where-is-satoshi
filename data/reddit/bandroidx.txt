JESUS, this sucks!  They were the best.
So now where are you guys buying gold with bitcoin in the USA?
@_date: 2015-06-30 02:44:01
Thanks much, I am checking out provident mint but for some reason a 1 oz perth mint bar is $1202 from Amagi right now and $1219 from Provident, even with the "bitcoin discount".  I guess they are just a more expensive company to order from?  On the other hand I save $7 in shipping.
@_date: 2015-06-30 02:49:48
oh wow mine does too.  Well that is good, however i still have an order waiting to  be filled.  of another gold bar.
this is so odd, i would figure if they disappear they would just disappear, maybe they are sending out as many orders they can with existing stock to reduce the number of lawsuits?
They are still taking orders in cash which is also strange.
A couple months ago they removed bitcoin and i made some comments about it, I wonder if this removal of bitcoin is related.  perhaps their accounting system got scammed some how (maybe by an employee) due to bitcoin or something and its causing them to go under? 
Really just speculation right now.
if my order shows up with a different brand gold bar than i ordered then that will be near confirmation for me that they are filling as many orders as possible with left over stock until they run out.

Ah, thanks for the info.
Curious, are bitcoin purchases of gold at places like Amagi and Provident reported to FinCen?
@_date: 2015-06-30 04:18:46
Can you elaborate?  Are you saying that FinCen wont let you sell gold for bitcoin if you also have a bitcoin product?
@_date: 2015-06-29 20:51:43
so you also have not been able to reach them?
@_date: 2015-06-30 02:36:11
one of my 2 orders also shows as shipped but the tracking says no info so it appears it was not actually shipped.
This is a real shame, they were a great company.  I hope they at least fill these orders that are pending, I already lost money on gox which still stings.
When you guys say they "sold out" do you mean Stephen Macaskill sold his ownership?  He was a big bitcoin supporter and afaik was the founder and ceo of the company.
@_date: 2015-01-29 20:50:10
do you plan on selling these on amazon via prime?  if so i would have bought one by now :)
@_date: 2015-01-13 03:25:37
I dont think so, they are major bitcoin advocates.  
@_date: 2015-01-29 21:05:41
man i wish i knew you in real life, the shit i could learn from you.
@_date: 2015-01-31 22:30:41
excellent, I am going to pick one up and compare it to my trezor.  perhaps use both.  I know you might be biased :) but which would you say is better for cold storage?
@_date: 2015-01-13 03:26:23
that is exactly why i am concerned it could be some kind of government issue.  if it was maintenance or upgrades i would expect some kind of announcement of some sort.
@_date: 2015-01-13 03:55:20
yeah but he said something more internal, not related to price, that could be anything
@_date: 2015-01-13 03:56:05
even if that was true, they would be dumb to turn off bitpay if it was due to financial trouble.  bitcoin sales drives their business, bitpay would allow them to continue to make sales and just ask bitpay for the cash.
@_date: 2015-01-13 03:40:33
I wonder if perhaps they had bitpay and the other method setup to pay them in bitcoins, with the price drop perhaps they wanted to disable it until they can switch over bitpay to pay in cash?  Then again that is a simple switch (i have used bitpay) IIRC, so why not just make the switch instead of removing the payment option.
@_date: 2015-01-31 08:47:11
yet trezor has the same reasons (they also run their own servers) but they were stoned to death for changing to the same license you are using.
@_date: 2015-01-26 01:35:58
this.  print out the mytrezor.com page and bring that in.  If all fails, ask to speak to Lt on duty.
@_date: 2015-01-31 23:34:15
I ended up ordering the btchip hw.1, mainly because it didnt require me to pay a whopping 19 euros in shipping!
Oddly it charged me VAT even though I am in the USA but perhaps that is used to cover the shipping.
@_date: 2015-01-23 05:00:11
the real problem is your government.  if the Chinese government would put real worker protections in to place the cheap labor and sweat shop conditions wouldnt be an issue.
Also the Chinese govt clearly doesnt care about IP theft or they would police the clones more.
@_date: 2015-01-13 04:05:18
they said they were moving to a crypto only model?
@_date: 2015-01-23 21:10:49
Yeah the issue is the greedy businessmen (so odd how this works in a "communist" country) will take advantage of the workers.  That is why the only way to fix it is to have government employment laws and regulations similiar to the USA.  Only x hour work week is allowed, only x hours for children, any hours over x hours is paid overtime rate, minimum wage, etc.
Of course these kind of worker protection laws will only drive up costs in China and China will no longer be competitive with other asian countries so of course your Government isn't going to do it.  
It almost seems like China is like the USA in the early 20th century.  Shit worker protection, shit enviromental protection, etc.  
@_date: 2015-01-13 03:23:18
They are heavily invested in bitcoin according to a recent coindesk article.  Supposedly they pay their staff in bitcoin.   Perhaps that article was part of their problems?  The government might be concerned about them skirting federal employee taxes, etc.  who the hell knows.  just sucks cause i was going to buy something and now i cant.
@_date: 2015-01-13 03:28:27
thanks for confirming, that rules out they removed it for just my account for some crazy reason.
@_date: 2015-01-29 21:06:29
are you saying ledger doesnt have the same vulnerability they are discussing?
@_date: 2015-01-31 21:58:58
thanks much for clearing that up.  one other question, will they both be getting the same support and firmware updates moving forward?  including both getting the same support with 3rd party wallets, etc?
@_date: 2015-01-31 18:42:47
Can you help clear up for me the deal with ledger vs btchip vs hw.1?  I am trying to sort this out, it seems btchip merged with ledger?  However it seems i can buy a btchip hw.1 still for 15 euros where a ledger is more like 30 euros.  Can you please help me understand what is going on currently?
@_date: 2016-03-13 15:28:44
yeah this is what i was thinking i would do next, i was flirting with the idea of using pywallet to try to delete these 2 transactions but it looks like it hasnt been updated in a long time and i dont know if its still safe to use.
@_date: 2015-01-13 06:10:39
can you give us any info Steven?
@_date: 2015-01-13 03:32:17
yeah but why remove bitpay?  They can just ask bitpay for the payments in cash minus 1%
@_date: 2015-01-13 03:50:32
jesus, but he made it sound like it would be coming back?
@_date: 2016-03-13 15:04:55
yeah but these pending coins would be doubles of the transactions.
@_date: 2015-01-13 05:50:51
lmao derp, i didnt realize.  ok thank god :) I feel a lot better now.  I only buy gold and silver with bitcoin from Amagi, they are the only ones I trust.
@_date: 2016-03-13 15:18:36
did they at least  have this hacker send them like 0.1btc from the stolen funds to prove this is not one giant troll of cryptsy?
@_date: 2015-08-19 18:33:12
it took 3 months but i eventually got my order.
@_date: 2017-07-15 14:05:35
why arent they at least posting something on their twitter then?  it seems phishy.
@_date: 2015-02-01 00:24:13
Ok cool I look forward to trying out the secure element vs the trezor, I will be sure to report back to the subreddit with my findings :)
@_date: 2015-02-01 00:53:38
so if i understand correclty, I will have to wait for the new firmware to be able to print a second factor security card before i can securely get my seed out of the device?
The problem I see is that the only way to get your seed out is to enter it to a computer, will this card allow me a way to get the seed without the true seed ever been shown on a computer?
also, can i setup the hw.1 to use electrum 2.0 beta without ever using greenwallet.it to set it up the first time?
@_date: 2015-02-01 01:26:09
so am i correct in believing this is the weak point of not having a screen?
at some point you must type or have displayed the actual un-encrypted seed on a computer.  so the hw.1 is only as secure as that pc was?
