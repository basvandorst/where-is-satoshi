Total supply of coins is related to Market cap.
There are only 5-10 coins in the Top 50 that I think aren't shitcoins with no future. 
I have been in BTC since 2010, but never had disposable $$$ to invest until recently.

 yes.  So many posts on "how do i trade" "how do i buy eth"
@_date: 2017-08-12 04:51:08
OK lets assume that there are two coins:
1.  COINA - An OK coin with a marketcap of 1 Billion.
2.  COINB - a new OK coin with a marketcap of 10 Million.
Which is the better investment?

They weren't specifically coding bitcoin,  but were working in the ecosystem. Ethereum was originally intended to be an upgrade to bitcoin, but the concept was rejected. 
There are many more devs working on ethereum vs btc. Many started coding around bitcoin. 




My opinion is based on a generalised view of the community.
