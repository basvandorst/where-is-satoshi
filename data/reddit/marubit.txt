Unfortunately those deep pockets seek to gain however the turnout. They hold BTC so will try both coins after the fork.

If anyone wants to fork in the future, provide reply protection or gtfo.

Why hasn't this post for more upvotes?
Elon only expects the same of his employees that he expects of himself.
To see your leader working so hard is very motivating and his work ethic is that everyone else do the same.

Buy some Tether coin which mimicks the value of USD.

Contacted all and respectfully asked them to reconsider.
Even if the effect is minimal, I hope it helps even in the slightest way.

I saw an excellent article appealing to exchanges to batch transactions to reduce network traffic. Does anyone know where I can find it? I think it was on medium buy just can't find it.

No one gonna try posting this on r/btc?
I think they have some kind of autodownvote for anything that questions or opposes 2X..

This month is bitcoin gold fork
@_date: 2017-09-28 10:57:05
Here's another similar thread
@_date: 2017-10-01 23:27:11
Perhaps I used the wrong terminology. 2X is not a BIP because it's not an improvement.. ( nor is it official)
@_date: 2017-09-29 16:40:01
Can't core just write some code that is too complex for the one Dev x2 has on their side to understand so he can't just simply change the 1 to 2?
We all know the gifted developers are on core side, but x2 are able to copy and manipulate their hardwork because of the simplicity of how easy it is for them to change the block size.

I'm new to running nodes etc; 
Does just running this help in anyway for the fight for more decentralised blockchain?
What can I do to help further?
Is it worth trying to encourage as many users as possible to keep this running?

Found this interesting reddit post closed to this discussion.
@_date: 2017-10-05 04:20:34
I'm genuinely interested because of the principles and features it stands for (they're trying to appeal to those worried about Segwit2x.) but I'm totally ready for it to be another pump and dump scam.
@_date: 2017-09-27 07:47:26
Whilst that hashpower as an individual would be very insignificant, if a large number of users ran one, would balance out the power that corporate miners have?
@_date: 2017-10-05 04:18:18
Yes but how can we know and protect ourselves?
@_date: 2017-10-05 05:45:04
Yes I'm sorry but just being told by someone on the internet that it's a scam isn't enough for most people!
What evidence can we look for to support or disprove it's value as a real project or not?
@_date: 2017-10-05 09:07:28
I see.. I agree those are past the forking stage and no longer relevant.
Just like a lot of talk about the worrying Segwit2x, isn't the BTG fork also topical and something we should educate ourselves about? 
@_date: 2017-10-05 03:17:34
Why should only those with enough resources be able to run nodes?
Any increase in difficultly to run a node an increase in centralisation. 
If we have a decentralised node and miner community, the technology in future BIPs will speak for themselves and the whole community can decide (not just miners). 
Right now we have massive collision from all of the self-interested miners who are trying to sway the direction of BTC development towards profitable mining, rather than what is best for users.

So bored of this meme. 
Yes it's great and all but not exactly news.
@_date: 2017-09-29 09:05:58
This. In order for the network to be decentralised, it needs to be as easy and accessable to the majority to maintain a large and diverse userbase.
Any additional barriers such as increasing blocksize makes it less accessible to ordinary individuals, making it more centralised among those that do have the resources to operate the hardware with increased required specifications.
This is the same reason some altcoins are against and ban ASIC cards for mining as they are expensive and very effective; As a result only those that can afford them can use them, creating more centralisation of hashrate.

Sorry here's a better link from Reuters dated Sept 8th.

That's the whole point, they want the power of the transparency and infallibility the tech brings without losing the control fiat provides them.
@_date: 2017-10-05 01:59:35
The principles sound good but I'm concerned of the small recognition it has so far. 
Principles include
- GPU only PoW (which bans overpowered ASICs and makes mining more accessible to ordinary individuals, effectively making mining less centralised)
- Segwit with 1MB cache
- Replay protection included

Well if I felt I was playing my small part in protecting the future of bitcoin and my investment, I would be happy to host  a node/small mining rig from my ordinary laptop.
I'm sure there are many others who would want to support the network and share their processing power such as with folding project etc.
Next we need someone to create a simple to use, browser based miner so ordinary individuals can vote with the minimal but spare processing power they have. (Which as a collective can be large)
If enough people use it, it could decentralised bitcoin again away from the collaborating miners..
I wonder who might be good to start this conversation with?
@_date: 2017-09-27 06:53:18
So are there other types of nodes you can set up that add to decentralisation? 
Or will it just have to be a regular mining setup?
@_date: 2017-10-24 22:44:59
Bitcoin is not based on any asset as such and has not intrinsic value, however the fact that the coins are finite and cannot be increased or decreased means the value cannot be manipulated.
Even a resource such as gold had very low intrinsic value in reality but it is used as a store or value because of it's existence as a finite resource.
@_date: 2017-10-07 16:35:16
Bitcoin gold is a small one. The principles of the coin are very good (it bans ASIC like Zcash does to reduce centralisation  by resource powerful miners) but seems likely just a pump and dump coin as it doesn't seem many developers are working on it.
Oct 25th is BTG. 
Nothing to worry about as it has real reply protection as any respectful forking project should.

Seem to be overreacting a little much. With this super interesting topic let's keep it productive by keeping it a debate and not an arguement!
Really good point from both of you.
@_date: 2017-10-04 14:36:09
You have clearly never had the responsibility and privilege to manage someone so cannot appreciate the significant effort required to coordinate and inspire a team to do great things.
@_date: 2017-10-05 02:04:22
I'm quick to be skeptical too. How can we tell these those things?
@_date: 2017-10-20 04:12:53
No, fiat can be artificially inflated or deflated. The whole point of bitcoin and most other coins is that it is based on a finite resource that cannot be manipulated (excluding massively premined coins)
@_date: 2017-10-01 11:16:57
If core developers are so strongly against it then you know it's a bad thing.
Those guys are the people that have built bitcoin and truly believe in following a path that is in the technology's best interest.
Not to say that we should blindly follow them but you know something is wrong if they so strongly oppose a BIP that they are prepared to let it fork rather than come to a compromise.
@_date: 2017-10-05 05:46:00
Hi Bash isn't this relevant as it's to do with a fork from btc?
