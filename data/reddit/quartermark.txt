Thanks for your confirmation. I am a huge believer in the potential of Bitcoin. The more I studied the technology, the more concerned I became about the scaling challenge.I have 20 years experience with software and hardware engineering (telecommunications networks and public cloud infrastructure) and I know how important it is to architect for scalability - this isn’t a domain that can be dealt with incrementally, and the “magic” of Moore’s Law is by no means an automatic solution (that suggestion is too dumb to warrant a reply).
I think that we should crowd-fund a social media campaign to roll out Lightning and make people aware that there really is a scalable solution for the long term. Seems like many folks don’t know anything about it: all they hear are stories about high fees and long confirmation times from the brief period last fall when the network was being heavily loaded by the explosion of new users.

I have worked in engineering and software development for 20 years and I will say this: when you are building mission-critical infrastructure (telecom networks, hydro-electric dams, airliners, etc.) you don't call them 'done' lightly - peoples lives depend on getting things done right. You don't want people to bet everything on something that you've only half baked. You don't develop an architecture with a big serpent in the middle "Here be Dragons". You figure out what you need and you put it all together and you make sure it works as designed. Then you start asking people to bet their bank accounts on it. Not before.

1/2 way. I got the audiobook. I like it so far. The idea is “don’t waste your life worrying about how to be a better person. Just appreciate the things that are good and don’t sweat your weaknesses too much.” 
I like the premise. It makes sense to me. Beating yourself up because you are imperfect is a bad hobby.

The addresses give you anonymity until someone  knows you are re-using the same address and knows what it is. If they don’t know an address is yours, and if you don’t re-use addresses, then you don’t have anything to worry about.

"Lightning's fundamental technology is a local two­-party consensus, known as a payment channel. Two parties send an initial amount of Bitcoin into a multisignature transaction with a local consensus on the current balance allocated between the two participants. Updates to the allocation of the current balance can be made only with the cooperation of both parties, using a new transaction which spends from the funds allocated to the multisignature transaction to each party.
One on-­blockchain transaction is made to deposit the funds into a multisignature output. Before this transaction is made, a refund transaction is created, which returns the original deposit to both parties. After the transaction is broadcast on-­chain, the payment channel is open and ready for transfers. When one wishes to update the balance with a new balance, both parties must consent to the new balance and generate a new spend from the transaction. In effect, they have created numerous "double spends" from an on-­blockchain transaction, but have elected not to broadcast the spend until either party wants to redeem their funds on­-chain.
These multisignature transactions are real Bitcoin transactions. Either party may broadcast the most recent transaction, the current local consensus state, to the global blockchain at any time to redeem their current balance of funds. As either party may redeem funds from this channel at any time unilaterally, without requiring any cooperation from anyone else, the most recent transaction is effectively their current balance in the channel. They may continue updating the channel with updated states without interacting with the global blockchain until they wish to close out the channel. In other words, updating the local consensus state is actionable on the global consensus state.
Updating the local transaction state is enforceable via mutual revocation of old states. When balances are updated in a channel, the prior state is invalidated via a penalty system. Only the
most recent balance state should be broadcast, which spends from the on-­chain multisignature output. If either party incorrectly broadcasts an old transaction state, the counterparty may take all the funds in the channel as a penalty. As a result, both parties have a direct economic incentive to only broadcast the most recent transaction state. This is achieved by having an on-­chain dispute mediation window before the funds can be dispersed. The global consensus state, the Bitcoin blockchain, becomes a dispute resolution system for off­-chain local consensusstates. Similar to how the vast majority of legal contracts are adhered to without going to court,
the balances in the channel are agreed upon in the off­chain local consensus state, and have the option of on-­chain programmatic enforcement. 
The innovation of the Lightning Network is the use of time­locked transactions and cryptographic nonces to allow many two­-party payment channels to form a connected network where payments can be sent over many channels without trusting the intermediate nodes. The topology is similar to IP networks like the internet: packets are routed over many physical links, and the communicating end nodes don't worry about the route as long as data gets to the destination. This works via a decrementing time­lock that permits every intermediate node along the routing path to accept funds only if they forward it along to the next participant, using disclosure of preimages of cryptographic hashes. In the Lightning Network, nodes are not able to seize funds traveling through their channels even if they fail to forward payments or refuse to perform any actions. A node operates without custody of third party funds, which is enforced by a time­limited cryptographic script. This is all achieved off­-chain assuming cooperative parties, and enforced on­-chain when one's counterparty is not cooperative."
Read: 


Opening a channel is a transaction. Let's suppose that a fully optimized block (SegWit, etc.) can contain about 12,000 transactions. That would be 12,000*6*24*365= 631 million transactions per year. One for every human would be ~14 years, assuming modest population growth. During that time we can expect blocks to grow to contain more transactions as well, although that should only happen after the block are fully optimized and the maximum number of transactions are consistently moved off-chain to LN or other L2 networks.


It's being tested now on mainnet. It's still "beta", but then again, so is Bitcoin. Production LN will be fairly common in the next few months.

On the one hand, there is bitcoin, with hundreds of skilled developers that work on it out of true passion for what it means to be a part of a revolutionary technology. On the other hand, there are the hard forks of Bitcoin, rolled out by folks who have divergent (but, evidently, not popular) views of how Bitcoin should evolve. Some of them are well-intentioned, some are driven by concerns about 'product marketing', some by business people who saw a way to make a quick million off the backs of other people's work. 
The 'network effect' - on the part of both the users and the contributors - always wins in the end. The only credible challengers are the corporations that can fuel an artificial network effect by leveraging other sources of revenue and legions of paid developers. Trust me when I say that I have seen that up close, and an army of dedicated developers working toward a grand vision will out-compete a mercenary development organization many times its size.
We are not here to make a buck. We are doing this because we believe we can make the world a better place. If all I leave behind when I die is a fat bank account, I will have left nothing. Being a part of the community that drives the reinvention of global finance and elevates of hundreds of millions of people out of poverty is something my children and grandchildren will be proud of. That's a worthy legacy.

Sorry for this, but I recoil in horror from the ‘Cult of Satoshi”. I only care about the merits of what he did (whoever he was). The fact is that increasing the resource requirements for participants in the network drives centralization and should be avoided to the greatest extent possible.

BTC isn't good for small-value payments right now. I would expect all of the retailers and on-line services that were playing with it for payments to back away until Lightning is fullly rolled out. And don't let the BCH marketing machine confuse you here: BCH is not a better solution - it will need SegWit and Lightning too. Too bad they have no development team to speak of...

I don't know about your number, but I agree with your sentiment. I am not a speculator in Bitcoin. I believe that BTC will find it's market value only after the price has fallen so much (and so frequently failed to hold a recovery) that speculators have given up and moved on to other opportunities (so-called "blood-in-the-streets" capitulation of the market). Whatever exchange value is left should then be be based on the need for BTC to conduct actual transactions and store wealth. I watch the market carefully and I don't believe we've seen complete capitulation yet. I would like to see a near-universal mainstream media chorus of: "See! The bubble has popped. Bitcoin was for suckers". Once that happens I will have faith in the trading that follows.

Agreed. I take consolation in the firmly held belief that we are going to continue to see radical swings up and down for most of this year. Visualize a bunch of whales suddenly deciding to crash your pool party. They get in, make a mess, get out and the water drops, spend a few minutes digging the thing bigger and jump back in again to see if it's big enough for a real swim yet. They'll repeat this cycle until they've made an ocean. Things will only calm down then, weather notwithstanding.

I didn't count 'businesses' as individuals. Every transaction a business makes is (in the aggregate) attributed to a human, somewhere. One way or another, the scaling requirements need to be stated and the system's architecture and implementation need to be tested against them. Remember: we're not concerned with whether BTC can scale to match Visa. If that's all it can ever do it's not worth working on. The system that we need - what BTC is for - is much more important than merely replacing a credit card processor's legacy infrastructure.

Exchanges are software and hardware systems backed by customer support and operations teams. They simply run out of resources to onboard more customers. They need time to fix software scalability problems, buy and deploy more hardware (or scale up on their cloud services), scale up customer support and make sure that they are not breaking any of their compliance requirements because they are manually processing new users to get around technical issues (this ALWAYS happens to companies that are scaling their user bases too quickly).

Speculators are investing in all of the cryptos as a basket, so when they get nervous they sell a bit of everything and when they get back in they buy them all back. A few trade on their merits a bit more (Stellar, Cardano, IOTA) and don't trade based on the 'payments' opportunity - all the Bitcoin variants tend to stick close together. Many traders try to trade between the cryptos and not flip into fiat because that triggers profit/loss events.

I just found this: 
@_date: 2018-01-20 23:29:05
Actually, the miners decide what blockchain version (SW &amp; protocol ver.) gets the most hashing power. They make money by processing transactions and collecting fees and creating new coins. They are heavily motivated to prefer versions that have more users generating more transactions and producing more valuable coins. If the software change is backward compatible (no disruptive change to the protocol) with the version of the blockchain that most of the users have their wealth in and use most often, then it usually wins the majority of hashing power. 
Lower technical requirements (less storage for UTXOs, less working memory, lower density of power consumption) reduces the cost of network bandwidth/latency and computing hardware and allows us to utilize temporary pockets of low-demand electricity to maximize the returns on investment in new power production (ideally renewables). If you concentrate on taking low value transactions off-chain and keep the resource requirements as low as possible you will have the largest possible distribution of miners, thereby increasing resiliency (redundancy, scale elasticity) and security (integrity, censorship-resistance).
Having the network's control and operational responsibility as broadly distributed as possible helps ensure that it is resilient and secure. We want all factions of human society to have shared stewardship over the network. That is the only way to achieve the level of transparency required for it to deserve the level of trust that billions of people will eventually place in this network.
@_date: 2018-01-14 11:05:16
Yes, I think you are right. It would be good if the speculators understood that this is only the beginning and that there is a lot of hard engineering work to be done yet. It would be a terrible shame of the impatience of the marketing people and finance people drove them to have their first bad experiences with Bitcoin and soured the market for it. To some extent, I feel like that's what has already happened with the fees. There is nothing wrong with the high fees: they did exactly what they are supposed to do and it all worked marvelously. But they should have been expecting fees to get bid up. It was the fact that they were all surprised that was the essence of the problem. All those folks who thought they could buy $5 of BTC on Coinbase and then go buy a cup of coffee with it...

Some are, but it should not be a requirement to participate in the network. Restricting the ability of folks with limited compute resources and limited access to reliable, low cost networks to run full nodes drives centralization of the network. Centralization of the Bitcoin blockchain nodes is the ultimate enemy of Bitcoin. Furthermore, why force this kind of centralization if it is possible to take small transactions off the blockchain? Why would we want to resort to unconfirmed transactions and giant blocks just to solve a scalability problem that can be solved in a more economical, fully decentralized way?
@_date: 2018-01-14 10:35:02
So how many will use it, how often and by when? Where do you get the 50/100 years estimate from? The Internet took 25 years to go from &lt;1% penetration to 85%, and Facebook reached ~1/3 the Earth's population in less than 15. Bitcoin has been in the wild for nearly 9 years already. We're not talking about solving scalability problems for our grandchildren. If Bitcoin succeeds it will need to reach truly massive scale at the fastest pace possible.
The reason is this: the cost of transactions is a reflection of the market for them. They are a finite supply on the blockchain, and people bid them up to whatever level is necessary to get their big transactions int eh next 2 blocks. Making blocks bigger increases the supply, but the available transactions will go to the people who are willing and able to pay for them. If you want to reach folks other than the richest few, doing the biggest transactions, you need to have more supply than the rich folks with large transactions need (or are willing to buy).
Moreover, the time required to execute transactions makes it very hard to use for small-value retail transactions. 0-conf is a terrible option because of the DoS vulnerability it imposes and the fact that it requires the recipient to take the risk of the transaction - it's like a check from a stranger. So not only do we have the need to handle a massive number of transactions at low cost, but we need some of the lowest value transactions to settle virtually instantly.
All this hand-waving about the specific scalability requirements that the architecture requires is not necessary. We know FOR CERTAIN that throwing larger blocks at the problem with the same all-on-chain architecture is a very, very poor solution from an engineering and economic perspective. So the question remains: what do we need the architecture and implementation to actually support? Numbers?
@_date: 2018-01-02 16:12:31
Don’t rush the project. This is a software product and an an ecosystem. Don’t draw additional capital until the foundations are sufficiently strong. Yes, increasing block size prematurely creates risk of economic centralization. It gives nothing but a temporary decrease in fees. Transactions are too slow for retail purchases in any case, so a mature layer 2 is necessary before we start encouraging growth. We DO NOT want more block-size forks. The BCH fork is a disastrous mistake and should be undone. Stop fixating on block size. The last thing we want to do is increase block size right now.
@_date: 2018-01-13 23:54:04
It takes a minimum of 10 minutes for a transaction to commit to even a single block, and 2 blocks is generally the minimum for a 'confirmation' on the blockchain (6 blocks is "fully confirmed"). If your transaction was processed 'instantly' it must have been confirmed off-chain (whoever you were dealing with must have agreed to consider it confirmed even when the blockchain hadn't been updated yet). If you were moving funds from one account within an exchange to another it's possible it was confirmed because that transaction never touched the blockchain at all.
@_date: 2018-01-16 14:58:09
If you plan to trade actively, play the daily volatility and sell when you have 1-2% profit on top of your fees. If you plan to go long, forget about the price for the next few months and live your life. Things will look different in the fall, but from now to July will be rough.
@_date: 2018-01-14 20:04:48
I do (or close to it). How many financial transactions do you make in a month? Count your credit card charges, item on your bank statement, cash transactions, transactions made by your bank or insurance company on your behalf, etc. Look at your statements - I'll bet you have a lot more charges than you realized.
@_date: 2018-01-18 06:11:04
Increasing block size increases the cost and complexity of the network and prices some miners out of the market, driving centralization of the network in the hands of a smaller number of owner/operators. This reduces the security and resilience of the network and makes it more prone to manipulation/tampering. This is a sliding scale, however, and in the long term block size increases will probably have to happen. 
In the near term, the plan is to get a 'layer 2' instant payment upgrade rolled out ('Ligntning') and get the exchanges and wallets to support SegWit, which is an optimization of the block contents that allows more transactions in a given block without increasing its size. These will allow for a very substantial improvement in on-chain transaction cost reduction and practically free off-chain transactions for instant retail payments (the kind of thing you'd do on a typical credit card, Apple Pay, Android Pay, or what have you). 
Once those happen (Lightning is moved from 'beta' to production nodes connected to mainnet and SegWit is everywhere) we will have a better view of how much the block size *must* be increased to support demand for on-chain transactions. Block size increases are a 'last resort' option for dealing with scalability.
@_date: 2018-01-14 05:42:03
I resist the suggestion that we should just leave important considerations like scalability to some as-yet undeveloped future technology. We need to go as far as we can with what we have and the only problems we leave unsolved are the ones we can't. I have been doing large scale systems engineering (telecommunications networks, public cloud infrastructure) for about 20 years, so I'm skeptical that the miracle of Moore's Law (or any such extrapolation of historical rates of technological development) is going to fix the problem of 10TB blocks. Moreover, we don't need to cross our fingers and hope for the best. We can do what the Internet did and acknowledge that layering is the obvious solution. 
@_date: 2018-01-19 16:03:52
It's not an "investment" any more than any other currency would be if that currency were expected to appreciate in value rather than suffer predictable devaluation. The point behind inflation is to encourage wealth to stay our of the currency supply expect when it's needed for a relatively short term, to facilitate transactions.

I don't have any idea whose plan you're talking about. I don't know who 'latecomers' are or why you consider yourself to not be one. Increasing the block size *is not* the answer, as far as I can tell, but if you have some sort of lucid, well-considered argument I'm all for hearing it.
Let me get right to the point: can you convince me that the all-on-chain architecture can handle 10TB blocks in the next 5 years without driving all of the nodes into the hands of a few powerful consortia owned (or controlled) by the 1% of the world's population that already own the legacy financial services infrastructure of this planet?
@_date: 2018-01-16 14:55:57
I think it depends on what you mean by 'long'. It'll be in the $30k range by the end of the year, bit I think it will languish in the $8-14k range for the next 6 months. This is just a GUESS, of course, but it reflects my expectations.
@_date: 2018-01-14 20:24:06
To an extent I agree with you. I'm only interested in buying a ticket on the plane that can actually fly. That was the point of this thread: the biggest issue I see is scalability. Because of the comments that have been made here and my own research, I have decided not to touch Bitcoin Cash (as a long position). I am cautious about Bitcoin now, but I may increase my activity once I see LN adoption start to grow. It would be great to have more public relations on behalf of Bitcoin. Bitcon Cash is running a tighter ship when it comes to marketing, which is really sad.
@_date: 2018-01-11 06:35:01
This is an engineering reality. Transactions on the blockchain are a finite resource and transaction processing times are deliberately deterministic: Bitcoin has never been a convenient solution for retail, small-value payments. There has always been a need for additional layers and I am very much in favor of actively keeping use of Bitcoin to a minimum until the architecture for payments is mature. While larger blocks leads to economic centralization and concentration of mining resources, the worst thing it does is lure yet more people (non-technical users) into the trap of thinking that Bitcoin is an alternative to Apple Pay or PayPal. We've all done the math: even at 1,200 transactions per MB every 10 minutes, if you gave 7 billion humans two on-chain transactions per month you'd need 5.7GB blocks. And that volume isn't even enough to support the traffic with a single L2 channel. Until Bitcoin's architecture, base implementation and roadmap are ready for this scale it isn't ready for prime time. Let's not make the bcash mistake of thinking that luring in suckers with the pitch of "no transaction fees" is honest, sane or sensible. It's also not practical for the technology to only be usable by the wealthy few who are moving so much money that an $80 fee is not even a rounding error.
@_date: 2018-01-26 17:46:58
LN is for fast, cheap payments for typical retail purchases. It doesn't make sense for an exchange to use LN, given that they have already effectively implemented their own L2 on top of a giant (or a few giant) wallets that hold all of the funds that are liquid in the exchange marketplace at any given moment. When you buy on an exchange like Coinbase you are not actually buying (or selling) BTC. Your funds only become real BTC when you send them off the exchange. When you send BTC to the exchange, that value becomes a notation in your account data and the BTC get moved to the ownership of market wallet(s).
@_date: 2018-01-29 14:28:40
The only people affected by this (really) would be the people who hold Tether. All it means is that a single Tether may not be able to redeem it full $USD. It harms the exchanges like Binance and Poloniex, who have no fiat currency option for traders who want to step in and out of the cryptocurrencies during trades. If you hold Tether and never planned to redeem them for $USD then your only concern should be that that the relative value of your Tether could collapse. The article mentions Bitcoin because it wanted to be read, and most people wouldn't read an article that just talked about Tether because they haven't heard of it before.

Bitcoin Cash, as a protocol, is practically the same as Bitcoin (fork, after all). Modulo: 0-conf, no SegWit, larger blocks. The difference between them boils down to a disagreement about scaling vs. the desire to take shortcuts to increase near-term adoption by casual users.  Bitcoin Cash argues "Take the easy path to scalability (low fees) now, get more users on board and worry about scalability in the future, when we have new technologies that provide solutions to centralization". Bitcoin argues "Fix the issues now using existing technology and let users come when the system is ready."

Agree.

BTC is still maturing and the market is noisy and rambunctious. 2018 will be a "buy the dip" year, with lots of random swings. I expect it to hit $8k and $32k without much reason or warning during the year. Take a deep breath and relax: this isn't the first FUDstorm, and it will not be the last either.

You mean in a single block, right? Isn't the standard for a minimally confirmed transaction 2 blocks?
@_date: 2018-01-11 06:39:32
6 blocks per hour means 144 per day, or 2016 every 2 weeks. If 7 billion humans made 2 transactions each every two weeks, that would be an average (assuming an even distribution) of 6,944,445 transactions per block. If we were to get an average of 1,200 transactions per MB, each block would need to be 5.8GB. Where does the notion of 133MB blocks come from?
@_date: 2018-01-11 13:53:28
What do you mean "tax season"? 2017 is over already. Are you referring to folks waiting for refunds to invest?
@_date: 2018-01-13 22:29:17
Thanks. Yes, I see that, but it's just an example calculation:
Quote: *"If all transactions using Bitcoin were conducted inside a network of micropayment channels, to enable 7 billion people to make two channels per year with unlimited transactions inside the channel, it would require 133 MB blocks (presuming 500 bytes per transaction and 52560 blocks per year). Current generation desktop computers will be able to run a full node with old blocks pruned out on 2TB of storage."*
2 channels per year is not actually the requirement. The actual number of on-chain transactions required for the Bitcoin blockchain to serve as the source-of-truth for an individual's stored wealth (anything that isn't in a channel to be used for day-to-day payments for goods and services) is debatable. I use the benchmark of two transactions per 2 weeks (one 'deposit' and one 'withdrawal') because that most closely mirrors the income patterns for typical users - it maps to traditional pay periods for workers, payment of rent and other bills, etc.
I don't think 133MB is truly the right way to explain the scale that the Bitcoin blockchain needs to support. But, I suppsoe, this is a matter of opinion.
@_date: 2018-01-14 10:56:34
Fair enough. I recall TCP-IP being rolled out in the mid 90's and a lot of people talking about IPV4 addresses being practically "infinite". Experts used to tell me that there were far more addresses than we could ever use, even if every single office worker in the world had a computer. We ran out of IPV4 addresses a few years ago and had to start putting everything behind subnetworks with NAT. Never underestimate the scale you need to support. We will find ways to use gobs and gobs of transactions, and the rich few will consume them all for trivial stuff and leave the rest of the world with none: if you do all transactions on-chain, everyone has to share a finite resource and folks who pay higher fees get them all, if they want them.

Are you talking about forking the blockchain?  I don’t know about you, but I didn’t sign up for any plan. What ideas are you talking about?

@_date: 2018-01-11 19:19:56
Yes! With something this volatile, you need to spread your investment over a fairly large number of trading days. If you want to buy $10k of BTC, try to buy in small increments every few days for a month or two, and plan to hold for 1-2 years. Unless, that is, you plan to sit 24/7 in front of your terminal and day trade. That can work, but it's only slightly less risky than playing high-stakes poker at the pro table.
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:33:25
When a single BTC exchanges for $100k, the difference between having bought at $8k or $19k won't be a big deal. Everyone here will feel smart compared to the folks who came late and bought at $94k. Just take a deep breath, go live your life. Don't worry about the exchange value of your BTC until you find something real you want to buy with them. Currency is just a tool for facilitating trading of real things.

It is much more focused on two specific communities: (1) the core development organization that is doing most of the work on Bitcoin and (2) the late-comers that have joined since Bitcoin became an investment fad. There are a lot of memes about getting rich and commentary on the exchange prices mixed with technical content. The historical core of the global Bitcoin community still relies on it as a central hub, especially for communicating with newcomers about the technical development and goals of Bitcoin. It is chaotic, but there is no real agenda. There is a lot of frustration with the folks who want to push Bitcoin forks.

@_date: 2018-01-14 06:41:48
Absolutely - I'm not suggesting that increasing block size isn't a part of the answer. We know (well, most of us do) that transactions on the blockchain are always going to be a scarce, high-value commodity. We know that not all transactions between parties need to be settled on the master blockchain immediately. We know that larger blocks increases the technical and economic costs of supporting the network and drives economic centralization, which undermines security and resilience. We therefore know that enlarging block size is near the bottom of the list of things we should do. At the top of the list is maturing the part of the architecture that handles off-chain transactions. Once we have done that then we fall back to the brute force option of larger blocks.

I don't know about this sort of crisis - personally, I'd trade all of my BTC or USD for 10 gallons of clean water and a safe ride north to Edmonton if there were nuclear missiles headed toward Hawaii. As for economic crises - I expect BTC, RMB, USD and EUR to be the 'safe haven' currencies and value stores if things got bad. Small currencies would be crushed because of the ease with which stored value can now be moved to BTC.
@_date: 2018-01-11 13:46:48
BTC is not yet mature. The architecture needs an L2 for small-value retail payments. Those worked in the past because the network was lightly loaded (very few actual users) and folks were willing to wait 10-60 minutes for confirmation. Bitcoin is the only protocol that is on a path to global-scale ubiquity and complete substitution for fiat alternatives. Etherium is hamstrung by its own engineering complexity and Bcash doesn't actually address any underlying issues - it just kicks the scalability problem a bit further down the road and ensures that when that blockchain is fully loaded, a lot more people are going to be unhappy with higher fees and long confirmation times. The hype has gotten out ahead of the engineering, but Bitcoin Cores is taking the right approach: slow and steady, solving the hard engineering problems in the right way. Things will look different toward the end of this year, I think. We should let the media hype pass by and be happy that the pundits and speculators have moved their attention elsewhere for the time being. There is work to be done and all this noise isn't helpful.

His business and brand are threatened and he has no interest in talking about the value, only the risks.

It could be August or September, I suppose. I've reasoned that July is when folks start coming back to work after vacations with fresh eyes and a plan for the rest of the year. They'll be looking ahead to the spending surges that happen re schools and fall holidays. They'll be digesting all of the ecosystem advances that have been rolled out (more funds, more exchanges, more regulatory changes) in H1 and they'll be remembering "back when BTC was taking off last fall". With any luck, they'll have forgotten about BTC as an investment and will have been using it over the summer when they were on holiday as a form of payment (maybe just once or twice). The narrative will have changed, and that's what will change the valuation.

Alts are pumping because people who don't know much are hot for something that will go to the moon overnight. If you want to play that game and become a day trader you might be able to profit off the mistakes of greedy novices - or you could find yourself to be one of them. Bitcoin's value proposition is clear and the engineering and ecosystem are strong. Bet on Bitcoin for long term growth, but expect a lot of volatility along the way. It may go up 20% today and drop 20% tomorrow and stay low for a month before it surges back up. Remember that Bitcoin is still very, very young and the market has barely begun to mature. I know we hear this a lot, but this is like TCP-IP and WWW in 1996. The bubble (which is inevitable) hasn't even begun to inflate yet.

Nope. Adding layers is what made the Internet scale. Add a hop and increase latency a little, but you get the benefits of routing and addressing abstractions so you can scale and get transparent redundancy. Lightning is an essential part of Bitcoin. Frankly, I'm still being very cautious about predicting the near-term future of BTC - once we know LN is mature and enough nodes get added to mainnet then I'll feel more confident that Bitcoin is ready to conquer the world. Oh, and we need SegWit support (dammit, what's taking so long, Coinbase!).

Currencies are tokens that are convenient to trade and have trust-based value (crypto or fiat - same thing). Volatility undermines the value of the token as currency, but then again, so does state-bank-managed devaluation (inflation). Bitcoin's value is that it is easier to trade digitally than fiat (lower cost, more secure, more private) and is more durable and convenient to store than gold or other similar value-stores. Remember: no currency today has any "intrinsic" value either. Be careful: I think you're asking the wrong question.

Average transaction: 5.40 BTC 
Median transaction: 0.287 BTC
That means that for 50% of all transactions, a $10 fee is less than 0.25% of the value of the transaction. Given the nature of the users on the network right now, you should assume that a $10 fee is negligible.
@_date: 2018-01-14 10:51:41
Granted - it may not. Maybe for 10%? If so, how many transactions would that really be? Would there be a busy-hour? How many of those transactions can wait for a long confirmation and how many need an instant confirmation? I appreciate the LN work. The more I study this the more convinced I am that the core development team is on the right track.

I'm trying to get a better view of what the requirements really are that Bitcoin is driving toward and see how those reflect my view and those of others with similar interests. I want to invest more of my time and money, because I think Bitcoin is something really monumental in its potential impact on the world. At the same time, I want to make sure that it isn't a dead end technology. I come from an engineering background (telecom networks, public cloud infrastructure) and scale is one of the most important and under-appreciated considerations for any new system. It's really, really hard to engineer systems that do very sophisticated things in terms of security, reliability, usability and can do it all at huge scale and very low cost. Everything I have seen from Bitcoin so far has been exemplary. The engineers and technical leaders are brilliant and IT WORKS! Except we don't know how to make it really, really big yet (or at least we haven't proven it). And that's OK with me, as long as the plan for fixing those problems is credible. To wit: what are the requirements and is the plan in place that will allow this project to meet them? If yes, then I'm all in. If no, then I'm sad, but I'll move on.
@_date: 2018-01-15 22:26:30
Traders profit from volatility. The more something goes up and down, the more money you make if you time your entry/exit right. Large traders don't care about the actual price of anything - if I can predict 2% moves (or more) with 90% accuracy I can cover the transaction fees and increase my position by 1-2% per day, even if the thing never breaks out of a long term downtrend. As long as it's volatile, traders make money even as it gradually descends toward $0.
@_date: 2018-01-14 05:43:21
OK, great. I agree that we shouldn't estimate if we can do better. What number should we use? How do we model the scalability requirements on the system so it can be captured in a set of test cases?

Once the regulatory environment has become clearer and the technical (scaling) issues have been dealt with (SegWit and LN) I think more capital will flow in, driven by users rather than speculators. There is more than enough capital in the hands of potential users to push the USD:BTC exchange rate pas $100k, but it won't happen until the landscape stabilizes and the speculators have moved on to the alts.

Bitcoin mining nodes and user nodes don't know who owns them, so it is possible for a malicious actor to secretly acquire control over a large number of nodes. The only durable means of preventing this is for there to be so many nodes distributed among so many unrelated owners that it becomes logistically and organizationally impossible to control all of the nodes. 
This is why increasing block size is a very dangerous way to increase scalability: increasing the cost/complexity and resource requirements for nodes will make it harder for unaffiliated participants to deploy and operate nodes on the network. Ideally, we'd like every person to run a full node on an appliance in their home so ownership of the network would be as widely distributed as possible, across many individuals in different geographies with different electricity and Internet providers, in different jurisdictions (different governments), different political views and party affiliations, different religions, different languages, etc. 
The network needs to be extremely large and owned/operated by the most diverse sample of the population possible. That is what protects it, not just the blockchain.

3) Transaction demand goes up, fees go up
4) Market cap of Bitcoin increases, fees stay as high as the market for Bitcoin blockchain transactions allows

Cash is for retail payments. Payments are a small part of the global economy. Electronic payments are easily done today with a range of technologies.

They are afraid of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:07:54
If you can create a fork with only a minor technical difference that provides a minor point of differentiation, then the forks become a means of increasing supply of fungible tokens. The ability to increase supply at will undermines the fair market valuation of the Bitcoin as a  container, since the value of any given Bitcoin (or fraction thereof) is derived from it's proportion of the overall market cap for Bitcoin. If you fork for no good reason (no substantial added value), you create competition between blockchains, and the effective capitalization of both chains combined is divisible by the total number of tokens. Forking incessantly will only drive the value of coins down, unless the coins have substantially different utility.
For example the introduction of BCH did not double the market cap of the combined BTC and BCH, even though the number of fungible coins was essentially doubled. BTC and BCH chain market caps will not be completely equal, because some holders legitimately care about the transaction cost advantage of BCH, while others will favor BTC because it is less prone to manipulation by miners and has more players and more capital already in it (inertia will keep BTC dominant for a while no matter what else happens). Maybe capital will slosh back and forth a while before it settles on a 60/40 split or something like that. In a slightly irrational market, where folks are not really sure what they are buying in the first place it is likely that the sum of both chains will grow modestly vs. having only one.
In any case, the wanton forking of Bitcoin is a bad thing simply because it adds technical and user complexity, dilutes the market cap of the aggregate fungible tokens and increases sources of value instability. Forking should be a 'last resort' option used to rescue the ledger from malefactors, not as a way of solving petty disputes between ideologues, engineers and marketers within the Bitcoin community itself. Once it's been done, however, the best solution is for the community that owns Bitcoin to prune the forks through consensus, with the preservation of existing holder value as the primary concern.
Anyhow, that's my $.02 - I'm just a guy with an opinion.
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:01:11
If what you say is technically correct then I believe you have raised a really, really important point. Maybe one of the most important facts in this entire debate. If we are witnessing a fight (between two variants of the same technology) for the future of electronic banking and finance for the wealthy half of human civilization for the foreseeable future, then an advantage like that for a single company or nation is monopoly-making on the grandest possible scale. I gotta go do some more homework on this.
@_date: 2017-12-20 09:54:03
It might be cool to scare the mom-and-pop folks away right now anyhow. This technology isn't "electronic cash" and it would be bad for them to hop on board right now either (1) looking for a quick pop or (2) expecting to be able to buy a coffee at Starbucks with Bitcash (or BCH for that matter). It would be nice to the froth to come off so the next climb will be on a more solid footing with a more committed and knowledgeable user population.
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:47:04
Satoshi's initial goals of a "peer-to-peer version of electronic cash" is not relevant, simply because Bitcoin isn't such a thing and BCH doesn't change that. I have no ideological interest. I am entirely concerned with the technology. I don't hate bankers, nor fear centralization. All stores of value other than trade goods are used to contain value based on (1) trust and (2) utility. If a container has higher utility than other containers it will be preferred, unless there is perceived to be a countervailing risk (less trust). The current value of all currencies, non-dividend-yielding equities, bonds and other paper instruments is exactly equal to whatever the person you are trading it to believes it's worth. Nothing more or less, by definition. Gold's value is at least partially related to its utility as a trade good (you can make jewelry with it that looks quite nice, for example), but most folks figure that this utility only counts for about 10% of current market value. I don't really understand the 'us versus them" attitude on this subreddit. The point I am making is simple: neither BTC nor BCH are suitable for use as "electronic cash". The difference between these branches is trivial and not worth the public relations FUD that we're seeing right now. Lightning may not be the answer either, but it seems bizarre for a bunch of folks to divide themselves into two camps merely to argue about which flavor of "not electronic cash" is better at not being electronic cash.

I think the rebalancing point is related to the question of your overall portfolio model. For simplicity, I have three categories of investments: 35% low risk, low volatility, low liquidity (muni bonds, treasuries), 50% in medium risk, medium volatility and highly liquid (cash, equities &amp; real estate) and 15% in highly volatile, high risk alternatives. In this category, I try to keep at least 10 bets, each with a 90% chance of failure and a 14x+ upside if they don't fail. I re-balance every quarter. I actually play BTC in my equities portfolio (bets on the companies that could surge with BTC, either as users or producers) as well as some cloud mining and some buy-low-and-and-hold BTC purchases, all dollar-cost-averaged in and out over a quarterly window to minimize impact from the volatility. Our thesis is a $1T+ USD market cap by Dec 2017. As I said, all bets in that category are assumed to have 10% odds of a win...

The federal Reserve can control the value of USD by (1) creating more of it or (2) taking it out of the money supply. The US Government can control demand for it by (1) requiring taxes and fees be paid in USD and (2) creating more taxes and fees. Aside from these considerations, the state of the government should have no effect on the value of the USD, irrational concerns of 'confidence; aside.

Fair enough. I’m being contrary, but not trying to troll. I’m skeptical that the damage to the brand from confusion and the resulting frequent errors will be more harmful than merely keeping BTC simple and concentrating on educating people about what it is for so their expectations are set correctly. It matters what users think it will do. Perhaps more than what it actually does, so long as it’s useful.
I don’t agree that it makes sense to rush a street-retail solution that doesn’t have legs. The current BTC offering has a ton of value, it just needs stability and some time to win trust.

If BTC market cap hits 2+ trillion USD it will have an inflationary impact on global reserve currencies and will (by necessity) have obtained the status of de-facto standard in enough markets for it to put the incumbents on their heels and affected foundational assumptions about state bank control over global finance and long-term growth in historically rock-solid instruments like US treasuries. Just achieving that scale will become a source for some degree of panic about what is happening to global wealth and power. I personally believe that this will drive even more value into BTC and the USD as the traditional safe-haven. I believe that Japan is already anticipating this sort of shift and is concerned that the Yen may not turn out to be a top pick in this new landscape. At the extreme, it is not unreasonable to see BTC as a new international battleground, with each state (or corporate) actor seeking to build tools that will allow them to counter the action of others.

Not really. The median BTC transaction size is $4,700 ( That includes people trading $100 or less (i.e. trying to buy a beer). Even if all of those people bought Bitcoin becasue they wanted to spend it like "electronic cash" they would account for a tiny fraction of the market cap. The mom-and-pop speculators that bought because they thought it would take off as "electronic cash" have likewise made small bets that aren't moving the needle. The money pouring into the BTC market cap has been coming from other stores of wealth, primarily. Those buyers don't care about "electronic cash" - we already have PayPal and Apple Pay and credit cards or whatever for that. Daily retail purchases are a tiny part of the economy and if I were selling a product like Bitcoin I would not focus attention on a use case that it doesn't actually support very well while ignoring a more valuable market that it can serve exceptionally well. To my mind, this is an ideology-driven marketing mistake. Fortunately, it's not having much effect.

BCH doesn't appear to be capable of meeting the usability requirements for a "peer-to-peer version of electronic cash" used at global scale, although it may be incrementally better than BTC. It seems like a classic engineering a cul de sac. Lightning may not be the answer, but BCH almost certainly isn't, as far as I can tell.

The BofA standard fee for an international wire is between $30-$45. For my purposes, fees like that are such a tiny percentage of the transaction that they are irrelevant. I my transfer outcomes are more affected by exchange rate and loss of interest than by this fee. It could be $0 and it wouldn't make any difference. As far as I can tell, BCH adds confusion in the marketplace and solves no meaningful problem. It kicks the transaction latency and cost can down the road for a few months. I'm saddened and dismayed that the Bitcoin community has been mislead into this engineering trap because of a misunderstanding about what problem Bitcoin solves and what characteristics are most important. The "peer-to-peer electronic cash" use case is not very important, and BCH is not a good way to address it even if it were.

OK, I concede on the precedent point. 2000% is pretty damn unprecedented. That said, the only way to identify the first time something unforeseeable has happened is with hindsight.

Philosophically, you should sell when the future value of the thing you are going to acquire is greater than the future value of the BTC you are holding. Remember that value is personal and situational: if you really want to buy a house because you love it and you need a place to live, then the house has higher value than your BTC and you should move your value from the BTC to the house. If you are speculating on the future value of BTC, you are gambling and no advice from anyone is going to be more than a guess (good or less good, perhaps, but still a guess). Many folks have estimated (myself included) that there is a range of monetary value expressed as $USD that each BTC could contain, supposing that the system continues to operate at all. We published a post on LinkedIn that presents our rationale here:

BCH won't make a meaningful difference for this use case. Dash probably has a better shot at solving this problem than BTC, supposing Lightning fails to deliver soon. Betting on BCH because it solves the "scaling problem" or the "transaction cost problem" with BTC is a losing proposition, because neither is actually true. BCH is better, but not better enough for it to be worth the hassle or to guarantee long-term viability. There needs to be a better solution to the street-retail electronic currency use case.

First of all, let me point out that normal, middle aged parents who start saving for their retirement have "wealth" that isn't cash. Farmers in India who have bank accounts also have "wealth" that they don't carry as cash. Those are examples of pretty common people. Furthermore, we don't need to find a villain before we fix this problem. Bitcoin was pitched as being about "trust", but in economic terms it's really about "friction". A nearly-frictionless, resilient, extremely secure, global-scale, self-funding copy-of-record for ownership of wealth is the most marvelous financial innovation in a hundred years. Some banks may go away, some billionaires may lose their unfair advantage, some countries that adopt early may rise with the tide when the large economies surge in at the apex. But there is an ideology-free win for us all here: less wasted effort on conducting our financial affairs with the bonus of better security and better privacy. Who doesn't want that? It's frickin amazing. So we get to retail payments next year, as a bonus project.

The 'blockchain' is like an endless series of updates to the records of who( what address) owns what portion of all of the Bitcoins that existed up until the time that transaction was recorded. Multiple computers work together to do this work and confirm that the changes have been recorded. All of those computers need to be using compatible software so that they can 'talk' to each other. When some group (like the NYA) decides that a change should be made, they have two problems to deal with before it can happen. (1) they need to write the software update and get it installed on a bunch of computers that can process transactions and (2) they need to determine whether those computers can continue to work with computers in the network that have not been upgraded with the new software. If the new computers cannot continue to work with the other computers in the world that are using the old software, then they can only process transactions with new computers. Since they all start with the existing chain of records, if this happens it is called a 'hard' fork, since the computers with the new software will start recording changes that can only be shared with other computers using that new software. The computers using the old software will also accept changes, but those changes will not be shared with the computers running the new software. This is called a 'hard' fork, and it means that you essentially end up with two chains of records that can diverge. If you owned a Bitcoin before the new system started functioning it will end up existing in both the original and the new networks at the same time and can change in different ways on both. For example, you tell the original network that you traded the Bitcoin to someone and that change would become part of the chain of records that those computers are maintaining. You could then tell the new network that you traded the same Bitcoin to someone else, and that change would be recorded by the new network as part of the new chain of records. You now effectively own two Bitcoin, and this is a "hard fork". If, however, the software changes that are made allow the computers running both the new and the old software to continue to work together, then there will continue to be only one chain of records and if you make a change to ownership of a BTC it will get recorded once. This is called a "soft fork".

You worry too much about the miners. BTC are lost every year as well as created, and the capital consumed in creating the BTC in the first place is also important to consider. In our model it always looks like a wash for every scenario, not very relevant to the value of a BTC.
@_date: 2017-12-15 07:31:21
My firm just completed a BTC mining economics study and we figured that the 2018 global average cost for mining a BTC is probably going to be around $3,000. We also assessed the total aggregate value of BTC if it were *only* used for storing value during funds transfers. In our model we assumed that by the end of 2018 20% of the $5T per day that is moved via SWIFT (in tandem with legacy proprietary infrastructure) will be moved using BTC. During the minimum-possible 10-minute elapsed time for such a transaction, at busy periods there would be $340B flight total, with 20% ($68B) of that as BTC, resulting in a capitalization of $5K/BTC. We considered that a near-death outcome for Bitcoin. In any case, we figured that $5K/BTC was a fair floor for us, and $75K was a fair stretch. We also expect volatility to continue to be very high, with swings of 20% or more until BTC hits $1T in cap. At that point it will start to be actively shepherded by states, buying and selling to try to keep the supply stable (since they have to compete with commercial miners to product more supply, they are likely to start buying and selling in volume to smooth things out - it will be in their interest, even if only to lighten the burden of all the currency hedging that would happen by the folks that need to pay their taxes at the end of the fiscal year in the local fiat currency).

I don't care about the "bubble" nonsense, but this sort of thing is the nightmare that keeps me up at night. We don't need traditional financial services provider-style regulation, but we need some confidence that the exchanges and wallet services (I'm talking to you Coinbase/GDAX and Bitstamp) are being run like real businesses with appropriate rigor and safeguards against basic stuff like foreseeable insolvency, theft or fraud.

That would be the idea, if you want a fully economically decentralized network. It may not be practical, but we need to keep the knob turned hard in favor of economic decentralization and not let the requirements on nodes creep up so that only the wealthiest Chinese/American/Russian miners with the biggest data centers, cheapest power and best networks can participate. Letting block size creep up is a REALLY BAD IDEA. Block size should be the last resort. We need a layer 2 rolled out and matured before we start fiddling with block size.

That is an irrational strategy, but if it helps you sleep better, go for it. How much you invested is logically irrelevant in the context of a decision about how you should diversify your portfolio. You should follow best practice and divide your holdings into groups based on three criteria: Risk, upside and liquidity.
- High risk, high upside, no liquidity: alternatives like seed-round venture investments
- High risk, high upside, low liquidity: penny stocks and small cap/emerging market equities, art
- Moderate risk, moderate upside, moderate liquidity: Large cap equities in growth sectors like pharma, tech, banking
- Low risk, moderate upside, high liquidity: value equities that pay solid dividends and do the bulk of business in established markets where they hold quasi-monopolies (Berkshire Hathaway et al)
- Low risk, low upside, high liquidity: treasuries, muni bonds, corp bonds, gold, etc. (these are basically a hedge against inflation)
You can model all of this in a spreadsheet and figure out how much you should have in each category to achieve your preferred balance of down-side protection, up-side opportunity and liquidity (you probably want some of your portfolio to be pretty easy to get at in case you suddenly need cash or find a really compelling time-limited opportunity you want to take advantage of).

It's not everyone. My investment in BTC is driven by a simple thesis: Either BTC will continue to grow and drive a revolution in global finance, becoming the first decentralized, distributed, secure global source-of-truth for wealth ownership or it will fail and go to zero. In practical terms that means achieving a market capitalization that is on par with other established stores of wealth, and I use gold as my measure. In 3 years BTC needs to reach a market cap equal to gold, and if it doesn't peak at $1T in the next year I will be nervous.

BTC will be held back my a lack of completeness. It’s value today is forward-looking. If BTC can’t scale to meet the needs of the global population, then it will be of minimal value. 
Do the math: there is no foreseeable block size increase that can relieve congestion that would occur at the scale that’s necessary. The only solution is layer 2, and it needs to be proven on paper for global scale, year 2050 deployments as well as have proven implementations that are working now, with a year or two to mature the design and architecture.
I am also a miner. Any changes which increase the requirements on compute, network or memory should be resisted. Some aspects of the BTC design, like difficulty, cannot be avoided. In fact, they are essential. But difficulty is an elegant solution that allows average people to use readily available infrastructure to participate in mining. Note that I also think that Core needs to be very careful in leaving loopholes in the design that would allow any vendor to gain advantage by using proprietary technology to secure an uncompetitive advantage (ASICBoost is a prime example). You can’t stop everything like this, but you can apply a constant pressure to counterbalance the tendency toward concentration of the BTC network in the hands of the folks who have the most money to design and build specialized hardware, large-scale power generation &amp; distribution systems, high quality networks, low-cost datacenter facilities and so forth. 
I wouldn’t want to see larger blocks rolled out as a quick fix to the problem of fees getting bid up. Larger blocks should wait until all of the other work has been done and we know the system can be scaled with the right economic incentives in place to hold economic centralization (centralization of mining) to a minimum.
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:29:12
You mean a 'bull trap' right? Sure, could be. BTC seems to be following new rules (not behaving like equities, nor currencies, nor gold). 
My firm has a theory: major wealth holders are dipping their giant toes into BTC to test the waters. We're speculating that they want to see how the technology behaves and how the market behaves under load (total capital, transactions, reaction to price shocks, etc.). What we're seeing are the warning signs of large amounts of capital preparing to enter the market in earnest. For holders of capital at that scale, this is a do-or-die sort of thing: BTC is an existential threat and they're trying to time it right. They won't get do-overs.
Just speculating, though. We have no insider information. We don't work for Coinbase.

The bitcoin blockchain is not designed to support point-of-sale, street-retail transactions like buying a beer or groceries. I know that's what the Bitcoin WP talked about "electronic cash", but that's not actually what was built or how it is actually used. Personally I'm fine with that, because I think cash is a tiny, and well-served, part of the global economy and I think Bitcoin solves a far more (economically, morally) important set of problems related to global finance and wealth management.
I've only been studying this technology for 3 weeks, but the reasons Bitcoin is not suitable for "electronic cash" seem pretty clear to me. That said, please, PLEASE, correct me if I am mistaken:
- Blocks containing transactions are added to the Bitcoin blockchain every 10 minutes, by design. This is deterministic, and the difficulty of the hash for a block is raised or lowered based on how quickly the preceding block was mined. That means for an on-chain transaction, you should always expect it to take 10 minutes to confirm.
- Increasing the size of blocks doesn't shorten transaction confirmation times: they stay at 10 minutes. Larger blocks can contain more transactions, however, so more of them can fit into a 10-minute window, increasing overall transaction processing throughput and potentially lowering the cost of a given transaction (until the volume is high enough to bid up the transactions in a block).
- As an example, BCH transaction costs are low now because the blocks are larger and volume is low, therefore the fees have not been bid up yet. If it were to become more widely used, the fees would be bid up to the level that the market will bear, which is where they are now for BTC. The difference is that the intent of BCH is to facilitate small "electronic cash" transactions, which are less tolerant of higher fees than BTC merely because BTC is primarily being used for large transactions. For example, a $100 fee for a $100,000 BTC transaction is 0.1%. For a 2$ transaction, an equivalent fee would be $.002. Median fees on the BCH blockchain are an order of magnitude greater than this already, even though the blocks do not handle an order of magnitude more transactions.
The disadvantage of larger blocks is centralization of resources and control within the Bitcoin network: larger blocks require more memory and compute power to mine and better networks to handle the transmission of data (double the size of blocks and, naively, you would imagine that network load is also doubled). This means that older, cheaper mining gear becomes either unusable or significantly less profitable than newer gear, and the ability to mine from an idle PC or a poor quality home network is greatly diminished. Larger blocks, therefore, inherently favor corporate or state actors. This isn't an all-or-nothing, but it's a strong bias against true decentralization of control.
What do I have wrong? What am I missing?

I don’t think what you stated is correct. It’s not clear that BItcoin has to be useful to college kids paying for beers. That is (economically speaking) not a particularly high-value use case. Very few people suffer from significant problems using traditional electronic commerce tools, like credit cards and PayPal.
The real economic costs, and greatest opportunities, are in global-scale wealth mobility and privacy. Replacing Special Drawing Rights and the SWIFT network will have a much greater social and economic impact than getting Bitcoin integrated with Apple Pay in the near term. Street-retail can be dealt with later. Building confidence in the notion of Bitcoin (by not confusing the crap out of people) and explaining what it does and doesn’t do should be of primary concern to all involved.

If 17.7% of the US population bought $1000 worth of BTC over the holidays (at this price) that would add about 10% to the BTC market cap. That seems like a stretch, but maybe 1.7% will buy $10,000? We'll see.

I think it is a bad idea to lower the standard simply because the requirements seem daunting. 2 transactions per day for 1% of the world's population is already about as low as you can go before the value of the technology becomes fundamentally questionable. I think even 2 transactions per day for each human is the low bar, frankly.

I'm not ideological about this. I don't really like to talk about "why" it was developed, because that doesn't matter unless it's visible in the final product. All I can say is that the current technology is very poor as a solution for point-of-sale street-retail "electronic cash" use. It is very, very good at replacing speculative equities, bonds, treasuries and gold. Most of the wealth in the world (perhaps more than 95%) is not held as currency, and only a teeny, tiny amount is used daily for buying consumer goods. The success of Bitcoin isn't based on it's utility as "electronic cash". That's why we need Lightning: so we'll have an electronic cash counterpart that extends Bitcoin for those use cases.

You raise a great point regarding the claim that the system behind BTC is better because it's "not being regulated". That isn't correct, although I think many of the folks who say it are just a little sloppy with terminology, rather than being uninformed. Any business that you deal with is 'regulated' like an enterprise, with all the standard concerns about accounting practices, contract law, labour standards, privacy, reporting rules, and so forth. When someone says that bitcoin exchanges are "unregulated", I think what they mean is that they are not regulated like equities or commodity exchanges or banks. For example, there are specific laws that govern how banks determine their legally required capital reserves, which specific types of records need to be produced to describe transactions, specific rights for government organizations like the SEC to impose fines or conduct audits with court approval, and so forth. Those laws don't apply today, but broad laws about not helping people evade taxes, or helping terrorists, or being responsible to your customers for theft of their personal data obviously do.
The truth is that for most retail users (we folks who are customers of banks and use credit cards to shop) will not directly experience the benefits of streamlined regulation. We'll still need to show ID when we do transactions or open accounts, we'll still have a service provider that collects all of our financial data together for us and helps us pay bills, send money to relatives, allocate funds to paying taxes or saving for retirement. When we use our Bitcoin wallets as funding sources for Apple Pay it won't seem much different from how things work today. The changes will be in terms of (1) the variety of providers that are in the marketplace, (2) the costs of the services they provide and (3) the speed with which they can deliver those services.
The big disruptions will be on the part of the existing institutions, like banks, wealth managers, tax lawyers, accountants, auditors, regulators, lobbyists, and everyone else whose expertise and day-to-day life is built around the specifics of current laws, regulations and technologies.

By the time the exchange rate reaches $1MUSD:1BTC the USD will be in an inflationary environment so extreme there is no way of knowing where it will land. 
Sometimes I think we should start thinking about things in terms of a notional "Value Unit" as a way to normalize all value stores. For example, we could start today and declare that all stored value in the world equals 200T "Value Units" or VU. As of today a VU could be contained by a single $USD (approx.), given that this is the current sum of the current exchange values of all of the stores of value (note that this number is debatable, depending on what you count as a 'store of value', but it is probably a fair guess for my purposes here). 
Following this logic, there would be about 13 Trillion VU contained by USD in a 1:1 ratio, given that is the approximate number of USD in circulation. If we moved half of those VU from $USD to BTC, then a BTC would have a value of (6.5 trillion VU/12.7 million - the rough number of BTC in circulation) 511,811 VU.
A single USD, by contrast, would be worth (6.5 trillion VU/13 trillion USD) 0.5 VU. Therefore, one BTC would have an exchange value of $1,023,622.00. If you moved 3/4 of the VU to BTC, then the exchange value of a BTC would be (9.75 trillion VU/12.7 million) 767,717 VU and the exchange value of a USD would be 0.25 VU. The USD:BTC exchange rate for a single BTC would be 3,070,868.00:1.
This will probably never happen, however, because:
1) The Federal Reserve can create or destroy USD at will, to increase or decrease the number $USD available to contain a VU.
2) BTC will draw value from other containers than the USD (gold and weak fiat currencies are likely to move first).
3) The overall global economy is likely to grow as new people are born and take on additional debt (which is what 'stored value' really is).
Damn. I thought I could make this easy. Sorry. I got carried away with things...

The economic cost of the transaction is greater than the fees you pay at the time of service. The costs of a transaction through the traditional banking infrastructure are ten times, or more, than the fees a bank would charge for an international wire transfer. Much of the infrastructure and labor cost for handling that transaction is actually covered by governments and NGOs and is paid for through taxation and other business fees, surrendurred interest on the funds while the transaction is being processed, and the like.
In the case of BTC, the cost of the transaction is fully covered by the service fee and even includes enough room for the provider to make a profit without any other source of revenue from the activity. In an economic sense, it is far, far less costly. It also has the potential to be much faster. The BTC network database can support transactions that are more rapid than any other similarly secure, resilient, private and cheaply/easily implemented/maintained system that we know of using existing technology. 
The time required to process transactions will drop once (1) the infrastructure supporting the BTC expands to meet current demand and (2) retail payment transactions are moved to a different coin (or perhaps Lightning). BTC is primarily a value storage and transfer system, substituting for gold or trade goods, rather than a retail currency. 
Think of BTC as a "normalization" layer to facilitate value exchanges, either between subordinate containers (fiat currencies, gold, other cryptocurrencies, Amazon.com gift cards, or whatever). It fills a role similar to Special Drawing Rights (ISO 4217 currency code XDR, also abbreviated SDR), with the exception that it's actually a complete, implemented system and not merely a notional unit of account used exclusively for doing fiat currency exchange.
That said, I just moved $25KUSD from Bank of America to a small bank in London and the wire fee was $45 and it took two full days. And I got two emails (one from each bank) and had to answer a series of questions, acknowledge that I was taking all risks for potential fraud and that this activity would be reported to the US government (I guess the UK doesn't care if I know they're watching).

Not sure what you say that. Note that an equity which has no dividend yield is worth exactly as much as the person buying it believes they can sell it for. This is pure speculation - there is no intrinsic value. A fiat currency has no intrinsic value either, since they cannot be given back to the state bank in return for anything at all - their only value is what you need to pay for them when you buy them to pay government taxes and fees. All currencies and stores of value other than trade goods (salt, oil, ivory, you get the idea) derive their value from an agreement between all parties about respecting the rules of fair valuation (i.e. we all agree there is some, how to estimate it and how to negotiate the specifics during a given transaction).

Right. It isn't "electronic cash". That's a simple technical fact. No matter what the transaction cost is, no one will wait more than 10 seconds to pay for a coffee. Transaction latency is the ultimate test of "electronic cash" and the Bitcoin blockchain is fantastic at pretty much everything else, but it had to prioritize determinism. That's why, even if they were free, the transaction confirmations would still take 10 minutes. Lightning or Dash seem to meet this requirement. LTC and BCH both fail.

I am guessing that you are primarily concerned with the cost of creating building power generators and the complexity of bringing electricity generation capacity on line quickly enough, right? 
Our analysis is that the economics of mining will drive investment in low cost power generation and low-cost mining data centres by states and large consortia in order to lure bitcoin mining infrastructure investment. Construction of power generation and data centers, mining equipment and other necessary infrastructure can be done relatively quickly and profitably at current BTC exchange values (approximately $18KUSD). The systemic risk of BTC power consumption causing large scale economic disruption is low. Construction of facilities for power generation and data centres for mining will have an unknown environmental impact, although it could be relatively small, depending on how regulators approach things.
The cheapest way to deploy new power generation specifically aimed at the needs of large-scale Bitcoin miners is with wind turbines, at approximately $70-80/MWh. The next cheapest means of production that could be brought on line fairly quickly is photovoltaic (solar), at $60-100/MWh (see:  These figures include all costs of operating those facilities, including capital costs and investor returns. We crypto is not generally network or labor intensive, so we expect mining facilities to be increasingly purpose-built and in locations close to the electricity production to reduce transmission loss and land costs. In many cases, tax incentives and special payments from governments will greatly offset actual costs as well.
Bringing new electricity generation capacity on line solely to mine BTC is already economically feasible. In fact, it's become pretty profitable, and will be come even moreso as the exchange value of a BTC continues to climb.  As things stand today, with the exchange value of a BTC at around $18KUSD, a modern Bitcoin mining rig (  purchased at retail prices, powered at $.12/kWh, a miner would generate about $800/month (24-month hardware depreciation schedule, see:  A 2 MW commercial wind turbine could power approximately 1000 machines like this (assuming ~70% sustained generation efficiency), thereby generating a rough gross margin of $0.8MUSD per month. This figure fully counts all costs for power generation and everything else, with the exceptions of datacenter land/construction/maintenance, labor costs, taxes and any other related datacenter operation license fees. 
It's possible to bring capacity like this on line within 2 years, assuming that the environmental impact studies and regulatory approvals are handled swiftly.

BCH vs BTC isn't the issue. It's irrelevant which is technically better - it's only relevant which is better capitalized. If its technological superiority is significant enough it will become better capitalized. If it doesn't, then so be it.

I suspect that the retail and small-value investors that were really looking for "electronic cash" aren't contributing much to the market cap anyhow. The bulk of the wealth that will get converted into BTC over the next few years isn't held as cash anyhow. The BTC market cap will grow by taking a larger share of stored wealth, displacing speculative equities, bonds, treasuries, gold and some real estate (REITs and mortgages, in particular).

Gold’s value as a material is very low relative to it’s cost to handle (because it’s a material). BTC is difficult to acquire and is extremely to destroy.

Any new product will have its value bid up by people with money to do so. As long as on-chain transactions are required and are scarce their price will reflect the market: highest bidder. For BTC to prosper it needs to be able to provide at least (this is my own personal benchmark) at least 2 on-chain transactions per week for 1% of the world's population (with a technical roadmap to 100%).

I don't understand your comment about "being  Frankly, you come across a bit like a 'boiler room' wannabee bro who's watched Wolf of Wall Street too many times.
BTC is an attempt to (1) make incremental improvements in BTC that will lower transaction fees and make Bitcoin more suitable as a form of "electronic cash" and (2) use the Bitcoin brand to enrich a fairly small number of insiders who saw an opportunity to gain control over a small but vocal community of libertarians and use them to amplify a message to the market. Neither BTC nor BCH are good candidates for a street-retail "electronic cash" because of a side-effect of the built-in incentive system that is still common to both branches. Enlarging block size has a minor effect and transaction processing times are not improved in BCH, so the general argument about it is that it doesn't solve the problem for the "electronic cash" use case, but it definitely creates FUD about the utility and safety of Bitcoin as a whole. It also created an opportunity for a few folks to pump-and-sell their hard forked coins. I'm an network and systems engineer by trade and from what I can see, BCH was not launched because it offers meaningful solutions to any relevant technical problems. It is driven by some other interest.

That's still 544MB per block (at 1,936 transactions/MB). And it assumes an even distribution of transactions in each 24 hours, implying that some transactions may take hours to be fully confirmed.

Basing decisions on the data because it is easy to get and easy to understand, rather than finding the data that you need, is a bad way to make decisions IMO. If you do an image search on Google you will find all kinds of charts that show rapid growth that reflect historical cases of rapid value increase that turned out not to be bubbles. Even the famous "Tulip Mania" bubble really wasn't. Neither was the so-called Internet bubble. 
I understand that dealing with complete uncertainty is, emotionally, more difficult than dealing with risk - you can at least model risk based on historical data. You can't model uncertainty. It's Black Swan territory.
That said, it sounds to me like you are talking about how much uncertainty you can live with, not about the market itself. Your lack of comfort doesn't say anything about the future; be careful that you don't assess bubbles based on how unable to distinguish a bubble from an opportunity.

Agree. When folks say that a currency is "backed by" gold, they may not appreciate that this means that the holder of a note is entitled to come to the issuing bank and exchange that note for an equivalent value in gold. When currencies were backed by value stores like gold or sterling, it was the value of the gold or sterling that were physically held by the state treasury that propped up the currency: you needed enough on hand to satisfy the concerns of people who feared a "run" on the currency and came calling to collect their gold because it was safer. The logic: because you could always get your gold, you didn't need to - paper was easier to carry and trade. That system was too complex and constrained the state banks from using currency creation at will to fight deflation and increase the money supply and/or drop shot term rates. That's why the gold standard was abandoned. Users of the $USD, for example, were so used to having confidence in the $USD they forgot why and no longer cared about gold. The fed needed more control to manage the economy via manipulation of the money supply. It all works well enough, but confidence is essential to all stores of value (except trade goods like salt, oil, spices, pearls or what have you) which do have broadly agreed intrinsic value.

Increasing block size doesn't solve the problem of transaction processing latency for point-of-sale retail use. All it does is increase transaction throughput, which increases the number of transactions that can be processed each 10 minutes, thereby lowering fees. BTC has lower fees at the moment because of this, but it's still not really useful as "electronic cash", for the simple reason that nobody will wait for 10 minutes to pay for a cup of coffee - they'll just use Apple Pay or Visa instead (and they should). Litecoin brings latency down to 2.5 minutes, but it still doesn't work for point-of-sale street-retail. Dash can do it, but the best technical solution I have seen is Lightning. The real downside of increasing block size is that the technical requirements for handling larger blocks (compute power of miners, network traffic) push small, independent and individual miners out of the pools. That may be why so much of the BTC mining activity is happening in China today, on new hardware bought by large companies, backed by the state. For folks with a libertarian bent, this should be scary.

If you are going to invest in Bitcoin you need to look at quarterly or even yearly samples. Watching it daily (or even weekly) will drive you nuts. I know some folks say they make money trading daily, but I suspect most who try that lose. Bitcoin is a bet on the long term trajectory of global finance. Don't invest money you will ever need (because there is a real risk of loss of *any* wealth store that isn't a trade good) and just leave it alone for a year or two. Ever notice how the stories about Bitcoin millionaires are filled with "I forgot I even had it" references?

My view is the opposite. The "electronic cash" need is easy to grasp for laypeople because they don't typically think about global finance and where wealth lives when it's not in their bank accounts. It's actually a very small and inconsequential economic problem, though. Current payment systems work quite well for street-retail purposes. A distributed, decentralized backbone for global finance is a MUCH more important mission. It's also much more valuable to society. Most of the wealth in the world isn't cash (electronic or otherwise), because it isn't going to be spent on coffee or groceries today.

As per Google dictionary, speculation is: "investment in stocks, property, or other ventures in the hope of gain but with the risk of loss."
Not all investments are equally speculative, but there is always a risk/reward ratio, hence some degree of speculation.

I like the spirit of your comment and I agree that this shouldn't be a competitive team sport. Unfortunately, I think there isn't room for both and I am worried that the most important thing we need to do - build public confidence in an alternative backbone for global finance - is being undermined by a very, very silly debate and a string of high-profile failures (looking at you, Coinbase). BCH is in no way worth the trouble we're seeing now. This whole fork is nonsense.
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:08:51
I am a technology product manager by training, so I think about this in product terms. I have no philosophical concerns. I think in terms of economic value and market adoption. I’m not if the opinion that BCH is technically flawed (aside from my concern about the door being open for ASIC optimization).
I think BCH is a slightly improved version of Bitcoin, but its utility is essentially the same. It has increased transaction process throughput, compared with BTC, but commit times are still too long for street payments and the incentives are too high (and variable) for micro-payments. Because of these shared limitations I  think both are competing for (nearly) identical markets. That is very inefficient. It also creates a trust vulnerability that puts both at an increased risk of slowing overall adoption of Bitcoin. 
As a product portfolio decision, I think it would have been better to simplify the user choices and concentrate engineering resources to mature the dominant (in terms of market penetration) implementation - don’t disrupt it until it reaches near it’s apex; let the dominant product go until growth slows and unmet needs become sufficiently clear to drive disruptive improvements with well understood risks and contingency plans.  
If you want to build a master ledger for global finance you need a lot of folks to buy in and disruption shouldn’t be taken lightly.
In any event, I’m just another guy with an opinion. The future is
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:45:54
Correct. The value of a "BTC" on either chain will vary based on how much people are willing to pay for the right to record a transaction on each chain. You haven't necessarily doubled your value, but you have two separate things to sell. It may even be the case that the value of the original drops an amount equal to the value of the new chain, so you might not gain anything. From what we have seen, though, hard forks tend to create new value out of 'thin air', so most speculators look on hard forks as a good thing. They may not be in the long run, but we'll have to wait and see.

@_date: 2017-12-11 15:14:20
The price of a BTC is determined by how many people are willing to trade a BTC to a buyer at a given price. The fewer BTC that are available to be traded, the higher the price is likely to be. If no one can reach you to make you an offer for your BTC, then your BTC are out of the market. If you lost them the result is the same for everyone except you. The thing to remember is that BTC is a secure, distributed database system: a ledger. The notional "Bitcoin" is a place in that ledger where ownership of BTC can be recorded. As BTC are lost, or the owners of those BTC stop participating in trading, the number of ownership shares that can be recorded by active users gets smaller. To compensate, users have to bid mode and more for the rights to use the remaining parts of the ledger that are available. Technically, each BTC contains 1,000,000 discrete elements (Satoshi), and each satoshi could have a different owner. While there have been 16.7 million Bitcoins created (of a possible 21 million), we know that a few million of them have already been lost forever, and over time we expect more to be lost. As of today, there are approximately 12 million BTC in the hands of people who could trade them (they know where they are), but many of those folks are not actively in the market. Those 12 million BTC represent 12,000,000,000,000 (twelve trillion) Satoshi, so there is still a lot of room left in the ledger. Given the active volume of financial transactions we anticipate, an active pool of a few trillion Satoshi is probably enough to keep the BTC ledgers running fine.

It doesn't matter what the originators (not just Satoshi) were trying to build. What matters is what they ended up building and what it's useful for. To wit: Bitcoin is not a street-retail "electronic cash" because it can't do that job with the requisite latency and low cost per transaction. Those are the facts. Sadly, Bitcoin Cash may be a little better, but not enough better for it to be good enough either. The only solution is to extend the architecture with a second layer that trades other characteristics (like scale, security) for extremely low transaction processing times and fees. Perhaps Lightning. We'll see. At any rate, it won't be BTC or BCH.

@_date: 2017-12-10 07:56:20
Yes. I started buying a few 1/10ths of a BTC at a time, every few weeks initially, then setup an automatic daily buy when BTC was at $6000. My plan has always been to Dollar Cost Average invest about 7% of my net worth in over 6 months and I'm a bit more than halfway there. I am betting that BTC is a transformational technology that will be a watershed for the global financial system. That said, I'm not a zealot either: I'm only betting 7% of my bankroll. I believe that this is aggressive, but responsible, given the magnitude of the potential payoff.
I don't really see a $0 per BTC exchange possibility, because of the inherent business value of the technology and the existing network. This system was fantastically difficult and expensive to put together and I can't think of any corporation or government that could have done it, at any price. But the important question is what it is all worth, in very practical, immediate terms.
There is one specific use case that is fairly easy to quantify that sets a rational floor on the value of BTC: International funds transfer and simultaneous fiat currency exchange.
In this specific use case the benefit of BTC over traditional methods are these:
1) With BTC, neither party necessarily needs to pay exchange fees, since both can keep funds 'liquid' in BTC for future transactions, or when demand is higher. Conversely, either party can buy BTC when the cost is low and preserve excess if they happen to have benefitted from appreciation when they do decide to transfer funds.
2) The BTC transaction fees will vary, and have a cost roughly equal to the upper limit of a BTC transaction fee, but less urgent transactions can be executed by lowering the fee paid (the less you pay, the longer you wait when things are busy). 
3) The transfer can be very private, with either party disclosing only what they want to disclose.
Imagine a scenario where an investor wants to transfer $25,000.00 from their account with a US bank (San Francisco) to the bank account of a startup in the UK (London) that they are investing in. That exchange takes two days, costs $45 for the wire transfer and requires negotiation of a currency exchange rate, from USD to GBP. While the funds are in the process of being transferred neither party collects any interest.
Now consider the same sort of transaction done with BTC instead. At any given moment, the 'value' being transferred will be held in BTC until the transfer is done. This takes some time: typically about 10 minutes or longer (this is by design - you can pay a smaller transaction fee if you are willing to wait). We can estimate how much each of the ~12 million available BTC will need to be worth in order to support the 'monetary value' that would need to be in the midst of a transaction at any given time during the year. Our friend 'dismalscience' gave us a link to the US Treasury publication ( that suggests that the SWIFT network handles about 5 trillion USD per day, or $34 billion during any average 10-minute window, spiking to approximately 10x that during peak periods. Effectively, if BTC were used to replace SWIFT, the total value of all BTC would need to peak at approximately $340 billion. If we assume that 4 million of the existing 16.7 million BTC are lost, that would mean that each available BTC would need to have a value of $26,800.00 to support peak transfer volumes. 
If users decided to hedge by holding BTC longer than it takes for a transaction, or opted for lower transaction fees and elongated transaction times, then the total value in BTC at any given moment could be double this number, purely based on estimates of the average length of time 'value' is held in BTC.
Even if the BTC is minimally used and doesn't do much more than supplant SWIFT as a system for international funds transfer and exchange, in the next 12 months it can easily take 20% of that volume (of value, perhaps not of transactions), which brings me to my view of the absolute floor price of BTC at $5,360.00.  At this level the miners can cntinue to get paid and the system will hold together nicely.
In this worst-case scenario BTC is not used to 'store' value for longer than required to execute the transaction (although parties could, if they wanted to). The price of a BTC would actually go up and down based on daily (or even hourly) demand. 
The really large opportunity for BTC owners, of course, is that BTC actually becomes a preferred way to hold value for the long term and takes some of the $7 trillion USD-equivalent currently stored in gold. Big-picture, there is nearly than $200 trillion that could be moved to BTC, eventually. I think the most sunny outlook I can imagine would be about $1.5 million USD-equivalent value stored in each BTC. That's why I am continuing to buy more every day, and I think the risk of losing 2/3 of my investment is more than outweighed by the possibility of helping launch a new era that could take my BTC to hundreds of thousands of $USD-equivalent value in a few years.

I'd like to hear what the core dev team thinks about the requirements in this regard. I just made this benchmark up, but if BTC core dev can't put a roadmap on the table to scale to this level (even if it's not implemented immediately) then the real-world value of BTC will be limited because on-chain transactions will be bid up to the point where the average human can (almost) never afford to make an on-chain transaction.

Dead right. The odd thing about the disconnect between the real-world problem and the use case that many enthusiasts are fixated on is that it is so pervasive. For someone with no savings BTC is not at all an improvement over what they have today. They only care about transaction fees, convenience and performance at the point-of-sale. For all the hubub about BCH, it is not meaningfully superior to BTC for this case. Despite Satoshi's opening line describing BTC as a "peer-to-peer version of electronic cash", it isn't. The market pricing of transaction fees and the compromise of low transaction processing performance in favor of security, scalability and resilience effectively doomed it for the "electronic cash" use case. I think this point is what is causing so much consternation in the media. BTC is being pitched by many uninformed pundits and shills as a jetpack when it's actually a locomotive.

Agreed. I'm new to this and have no tribe. I spent a few weeks studying the technology and I don't see how BCH solves the transaction cost and latency problem wrt "electronic cash". BTC is already the "electronic gold" back-end value store and normalization layer, but it needs a sub-$.05/tx, sub-10-second/tx  counterpart for street retail use. I believe Lightning is the (technically) superior solution, but it's not moving very quickly. Is there a chance that another coin, like Dash, could help? I'm still doing research...

Actually, equities can be either purely speculative or a source of income. When you buy an equity that doesn't pay a dividend, your only way to get a return on that investment is to hope that some other person will buy it for more than you did. Why would they do that? Because they expect the firm to pay dividends eventually or they expect a change of ownership that will force the capital in the enterprise to get returned to shareholders in some form of payment. Or they plan to sell it to someone else who does for more than they paid. Most equities that don't pay a dividend are a purely speculative investment that isn't (in practice) backed by ANYTHING. If you can't sell your stock, it's worthless, irrespective of how well or poorly the company is performing. 
States default on debt fairly often, though, as do corporations. There is not such a thing as risk-free debt - generally, loans that pay interest do so in proportion to the risk of loss. Estimating risk is the  job of the investor. Finding the highest reward for the risk you take is the  job. Bitcoin isn't different from any of these instruments, from an investor's perspective, with the exception that the market for this type of wealth container has an unknown behavior, making it harder to estimate risk. That's one of the reason the market is so volatile. 
Right now daily turnover is around 11% of market cap and the average transaction is $75k. This is a roiling, lumpy market with a relatively large proportion of the capitalization in the hands of a small number of ideological investors who are pretty unpredictable. As the market cap grows past $1T you will see it start to stabilize, simply because a single user or transaction will have a smaller and smaller effect on any given trading period. At this scale, BTC is big enough to be dangerous, but still small enough for a single hedge fund to swing by the tail. I plan to ride it out. Lots of folks want BTC to be weak enough to control, but nobody actually wants it to fail. It's too valuable.
@_date: 2017-12-09 05:55:36
"Adoption" means that more people are moving more value out of other value containers and into BTC. I'm not convinced that BTC is a currency, purely because of technical limitations, so I don't think the measure of success is how many folks use it to buy a loaf of bread. I think of BTC as an alternative to treasury bills, gold, silver, oil, real estate, and so forth. Only a fool stores more value in a currency than they think they will need to satisfy their short-term liquidity needs, because of deliberate (state managed) fiat currency devaluation (inflation).

Jeff Desjardins did a great infographic on "where is all the wealth in the world" in 2015 and published it here:  If we assume that the  viable container of value for storage or transactions will likely need to be capable of holding 10% of the value of the current money supply ($90T) plus gols ($7.7T), then there was, as of 2015, about ~$100T of value that Bitcoin could plausibly be substituted for. Bitcoin has a sufficiently capable and proven foundation technology, a varied and competitive ecosystem of supporting suppliers and a massive, functional, self-supporting network representing many billions of dollars of capital investment and global operational coordination. 
The first of the legacy value containers that could be displaced by (converted to) BTC are likely to be the ones that have the:
* greatest volatility: e.g. failing fiat currencies in countries with limited access to a legal supply of global reserve currencies (Zimbabwe, Venezuela and others)
* highest transaction costs: e.g. international funds transfers, physical object exchange (gold)
* the highest costs to hold: e.g. paper notes, physical gold, all fiat currencies subject to state-bank managed inflation
It is reasonable to guess that 10% of this ~$100T could be contained/backed by Bitcoin, which would then have an aggregate 'market' capitalization of ~10T. 16.7 million Bitcoins have been mined to this date, and it is reasonable to deduct the 4 million that are probably already lost to the market when calculating the estimated future value of a BTC in this scenario. $10T/12.7M=$787,401.57.
You can almost certainly find different sources for some of this data and get a different result. Some estimates are based on 10% of $200T and include bonds, equities and other stuff. Some experts think as few as 1-2 million BTC have been lost, rather than 4. The range for "expert" estimates seems to be $0.6M to $1.5.

You're missing the point: We *don't want* more people using the BTC blockchain, putting more capital in the system and loading it with more transactions until we have finished the architecture that will allow the system to scale big enough to meet future demand. We don't want to increase block size or do *anything* until the complete architecture (including at least one layer 2 for real-time micro-payments) has been implemented and matured. Until that's done, we like high fees and slow confirmation times, since those help discourage causal users that want to waste transactions on the BTC blockchain buying $5 coffee.
Rushing the engineering so you can bring down transaction fees temporarily and scam a bunch of average people-on-the-street with dumb-ass "you can buy a coffee with Bitcoin" stories is the BCH play. We don't need more hard forks. We need to keep heads down and let Core get the damn software to a 1.0.

BitCoin’s rapid ascent is not proof if a bubble. Not all exuberance is irrational.
Tulips are flowers and their essential value is prettiness.
Equities are a share of ownership of a business that may provide dividends if it does well.
Gold is a primarily a trade good that has a number of high-value uses, from art and jewelry to high-tech manufacturing.
BitCoin, by contrast,  is a new technology for the secure, low-cost, electronic storage and quick exchange of value at massive, transnational scale.
The ability of the BitCoin technology and network to facilitate the sort of rapid movement of capital that we’re seeing right now is proof of efficacy, not “proof” of a bubble.
It’s not necessary for everyone using the system to fully understand why it is good. Many people who are driven to embrace BitCoin by uninformed speculation may still be making the right decision (like buying in to Google’s IPO). Never mind their reasons. Uber drivers and elementary school teachers suddenly caring about BitCoin tells us only that adoption is growing.
The most credible “bubble” risk is that many speculators may not appreciate the difference between BitCoin and other propositions that use similar technologies or terminologies or marketing pitches.

Note that I'm not comparing BTC and BCH here. As far as I am concerned the technical differences between the two are relatively minor and pale in comparison to the importance of adoption.

Not all of this volatility is because of a lack of regulation. BTC is churning about 11.5% of its market cap daily, with median transactions in the $80k range. Those transactions are driven by very large players that are testing the market, not by mom-and-pop investors. The current total cap of BTC is super tiny, in comparison to what hedge funds deal with every day. The volatility in BTC won't slow down until it hits a market cap above $1-2T. The market cap will outgrow the 'lumpiness' of these middle-sized trades (too huge for mom-and-pop, teeny-tiny for a bank) and volatility will start to drop.
@_date: 2018-09-09 21:49:11
Yes. A greater percentage of transactions will be driven by economic activity that is price-sensitive but not price-motivated (i.e. price speculation) and the number of actors with enough capital to swing the market with pumps/dumps will be fewer.

The value is set by the exchanges (or whoever you want to give them to). If you have an on-line wallet, the operator of that wallet has to decide how the two should be presented to you, or whether the new or old chain will be presented at all.

Yes, they are. They are well aware of the state of this market. They have had some of the most brilliant engineers and analysts I have ever worked with looking at this in detail for the last 2 years. Many people on this thread seem to think all bankers are evil, and I guess I don't have to argue that one way or the other. I can say, though, that they are absolutely not stupid, nor are they careless. They occasionally fall victim to group-think and can't see the forest for the trees, but that isn't by any means unique to Bankers (hell, just look at or Large financial services firms are examining the BTC leadership, engineering team, core technology and trading market very, very carefully. Their strategies for controlling (or at least influencing) the market and for developing predictive (even psychographic) models for it's behavior are well thought through.

I don't think they do, in fact. The median transaction sizes are WAAAAAY above a 'normie' trade. All of them together aren't moving the needle. The inflows that we're seeing are professionals moving large capital. They're day-trading BCH hoping to make some quick cash from the other folks who don't know what it (or even BTC) actually are. The real capital that is in play is smart money now. You may not like bankers, but they have been doing their homework for months and they are buying in because they understand exactly what they are getting. They aren't interested in "electronic cash" because cash is a tiny share of the global economy. It matters to the masses, because that's what they see every day, but it's one of the weakest value propositions for BTC. It's just marketing. 
But then again I'm just another heretic with an opinion.

Block time is about the same. BTC is handling 5x the transactions per hour (over last 24). Average BCH transaction value is 3x higher than BTC and median is about 60% the size of BTC, although the value per coin is much lower.
Average BCH transaction fees are creeping up past $.274. As the network loads the bid for priority will go up.

Prices on the different exchanges vary based on demand. The market is still developing, and I expect the wallet providers to step back from operating exchanges so they can concentrate on managing the customer's portfolio. A traditional example would be the distinction between the NASDAQ and Fidelity. This distance will allow the wallet providers to shop buy/sell orders to whatever exchanges are showing highest demand at any given moment. This has to happen one way or another as BTC stabilizes and reaches for the next level of growth. The market needs to become global to be sufficiently efficient.

Currencies are used to facilitate transactions. Currencies are not an instrument that is intended to store wealth over long (multi-year) periods. 
Inflation serves to discourage folks from hogging the money supply for the misuse (storing wealth). We need the money supply for transactions and it's not helpful to have it locked in safes or under mattresses. There is a slight increase in the aggregate cost of purchased goods during the time that wealth is in the form of a currency instrument: inflation during the time it takes for a currency transaction. On a per-transaction basis, that inflationary pressure is lost in the noise of the price fluctuations which are driven by other, unrelated factors (like demand/supply fluctuation, out-of-band constraints on the parties executing the transaction). 
The lesson people should take away is that you shouldn't store your wealth as currency. That's not new advice. 
Moreover, the long-term impact on inflation on a currency isn't really much of an issue, although it is pretty sensational and makes for a good story. The real inflation story that matters is hyperinflation, where the impact of inflation on prices is so rapid that it becomes relevant even for short-time-frame uses facilitating individual transactions. When you talk about inflation, looking at time frames longer than a year or two is just a fun thing to do, but it's not very informative or relevant.

Capitalization is a good measure of interest. It would be hard to measure the aggregate utility of a crypto any other way. Valuation isn't the only thing that matters, but caring about it is completely valid. I agree, though, that the focus on BTC as a speculative investment is a bit boring. I'd rather see exchange rates used as a proof point for adoption and growth.

I personally (gut feel) put the odds of survival at 25-30%. I think this will be binary (thrive or die with nothing in between) and if it thrives, it will be one of the most important technological changes in human history. We will remember the rise of Bitcoin as the beginning of a new financial order that marked the start of the 21st century. Or it could be another Y2K. In any case, I think savvy investors need to ignore the weekly or monthly price swings. I will only be worried if I see the total SHA-256 hash power decline YoY or see the Bitcoin core development team wither or churn too rapidly.

Storing wealth is valuable. BTC is a technologically advanced replacement for gold. It is not a currency and I don't really see that as an issue. It would be nice to be able to make small retail payments using the same store-of-wealth (rather than having to move value between instruments depending on the nature of the transaction at hand), but that would be an added bonus, not a core concern.

Bitcoin continues to bounce off it's cost floor, looking for a reason to go up. Demand is still primarily driven by speculators, although they are long-term (1-5 years) speculators rather than day traders (as I believe we saw at the beginning of 2018). These speculators are accumulating BTC at what they believe is close to cost.
Let me explain my rationale (please comment):
If you want to acquire BTC legally, you must either trade for it or mine it. Creating mining infrastructure, getting licensed, hiring staff to administer machines, paying the costs on the debt to acquire facilities, hardware and electricity are all significant. Recovering your initial investment (getting your BTC) by mining BTC is typically a year or more. [If the cost of mining a BTC is in the range of $6,000.00]( then buying it on the market for a comparable price is better - faster, easier &amp; lower risk.
Investors have been plowing vast sums of money into mining BTC and the BTC [hashrate has been climbing steadily]( As the BTC hashrate continues to climb, the cost of mining BTC will climb as well. If the price of mining a BTC in April in China was $3,172.00 and the hashrate has increased from 27,000,000 TH/s to 53,000,000 TH/s since then, you could imagine that the cost of mining as increased by 50-100% as well. At this point, it is likely that the market price of BTC is close to the average cost of mining BTC.
When the market price of BTC is close enough to the cost of mining, the investors who are trying to accumulate BTC at the lowest cost will stop investing in mining and will instead buy BTC on the market, which has the effect of increasing demand and driving the price up. When the market price reaches the point where a longer-term mining investment yields more BTC for a given price than market purchases, those investors stop buying BTC and instead put their money back into mining. This has the effect of reducing demand and causes the price to drop.
If you believe that BTC offers a technically superior alternative to a store-of-value asset like Gold and therefore will not become valueless, then you should be comfortable buying BTC at it's cost of production. It's cost of production is rising steadily, however, as illustrated by the hashrate growth trend.
I believe that there is a very good chance that the current market value of BTC is close to its cost of production and investor capital is likely to sustain these prices. I do not believe that we are likely to see prices drop much below this level, and if so only briefly (hours, not days).
I also believe that it is likely that price appreciation will track closely to the rate of increase in the hashrate of the network, until BTC is more directly integrated with more external economies. This integration with external economies will serve to somewhat decouple the price of BTC from trading behavior, because more transactions will be driven by the opportunity cost of the economic activity that is being facilitated by a given transaction.
More BTC transactions being executed based on time-sensitive economic events other than mere fluctuations in the market price of BTC will have a stabilizing effect. Today, the opportunity cost of a BTC purchase (to most speculators) is merely the cost of debt, and they can execute their trades whenever they are comfortable with the BTC price. It's a game of 'chicken' between speculators. When more BTC transactions are being executed for things like purchases of major assets, repayment or purchase of debt instruments, investments in businesses or payment of taxes, (and so forth) then the behavior of the markets will change as well - it will become less volatile and greater demand will lead to more consistent appreciation.
Further, this appreciation will also directly lead to still more price stability and appreciation. As the total global wealth stored as BTC increases (the so-called 'market cap') the ability of individual actors (funds, private investors, individual exchanges) to alter the market price by mass purchases/dumps will also diminish - there will simply be fewer and fewer actors able to move capital at the scale necessary to deliberately, dramatically affect market prices.
With all this in mind, I am accumulating BTC and I am bullish for 2019. As for 2018, it remains to be seen where we will go, but we should expect it to be choppy.
ADDED: For the record, I think 'Technical Analysis' is complete BS and is a waste of time. It has no proven predictive power at all and is a silly pseudoscience. I disregard all price predictions based on TA, without exception. People who talk about "support" and "resistance" or "descending wedges" are full of crap. Do some statistical analysis of TA and you'll immediately see what I mean.
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:57:10
The spike above $15 was the anomaly. It may have been caused by technical issues combined with a rush of small-transactions (lots of spam from some bad actors, combined with lots of retail buyers ruching in small buys on GDAX). If you look at the network stats history ( you'll see that mempool ballooned and transactions bumped up starting Dec 6 and it took a few days to clear. I wouldn't rush to use market terminology to explain that period - it was quite unique. The last 3 days have been much more representative of 'normal' market action (unaffected by technical issues).

In terms of storing value, an equity is either (1) speculation on the value of a future trade or (2) speculation on the eventual value of future dividends, either from (a) ongoing operation or (b) liquidation of the business. I would argue that most of the value in equities, REITs, muni bonds, convertible notes, treasuries and so forth is fair game for conversion to BTC. There's no obvious reason why not, as long as the risk/reward ratio is satisfactory. Those may not come early, as I mentioned, but they are still going to contribute a share at any volume (they are today, if small). I don't think it matters whether we're talking notes in circulation or accounting units, as far as currency is concerned. I think BTC is least likely to compete with physical notes because it's not a great payment technology as it is now. It needs a layer 2 counterpart - Lightning, or maybe a companion like Dash.
I don't believe that anyone has the model, or the data, needed to really slice-and-dice each value container category to get clarity on whether the BTC cap is $10T or $1.7T or somewhere in between by the end of next year. I am personally looking at $60-100k by the end of 2018. I always end up selling some as the valuation rises just because I need to rebalance my portfolio every quarter. I had the same approach with Baidu, Apple and Abbvie and some of the other larger positions I've had over the years. Nothing is ever a sure thing and a portfolio diversification strategy is the only way to account for uncertainty. By definition you will never achieve the theoretical maximum growth, no matter what you do, but at least you're playing with skill and not just gambling.
I believe that BTC adoption will be driven by geopolitical forces, more than US consumer or financial market trends. The US, Japan, EU, China, UK are all bastions of traditional finance, with strong currencies. When some of the smaller, more troubled states start abandoning their fiat currencies in favor of digital currencies they will want to back them with something, and I believe BTC will pay the role of 'special drawing rights', in that BTC gives them liquidity and access to foreign capital in a private, global marketplace that doesn't get pegged to any one reserve currency. we will see as much a $0.5T flow in next year because of abandonment of fiat currencies like this. If those experiments go well, other countries with inflationary currencies will as well. There is a strong possibility that demand for reserve currencies will weaken - $0.5-$1.0T moving out of the $USD will be enough to move the needle. The fed will have to respond by tightening supply, given that rates are already extremely low. If we see demand for $USD start to weaken, then we will likely start to see inflation, which will have the effect of increasing the relative value of BTC, exacerbating the favorable comparison and potentially driving an escalating divergence, with BTC experiencing increasing value because of the increasing weakness in the $USD. Any kind of major geopolitical shock or an unexpected change in the value of the $USD (the return of 3-4% inflation) will drive capital into BTC more quickly.

But neither BTC nor BCH are a "peer-to-peer version of electronic cash". Whatever Satoshi's vision was, we ended up with something great, but not that. If you want electronic cash, look at Dash or wait for Lightning. Even if BCH increases block size to 32MB next year it still won't solve the fundamental problems of 10-minute commit times for transactions of any size, with any fee. Enlarging block sizes also places an increased compute/memory burden on the nodes in the network and on the network itself, which poses security and reliability risks to the system (creates new vectors of attack) and biases the system in favor of miners with better compute and network infrastructure (i.e. state or corporate actors). Equally importantly (and often overlooked) is the fact that BCH is vulnerable to ASIC acceleration (because it forked before SegWit). This is a major weakness and some argue (speculate) that BitMain may be pumping BCH because they have proprietary hardware in the works that will give their miners a defensible (patented) technical advantage over others.

Unless you are destitute, your wealth (401k) is stored somewhere, and so is the wealth of the people you rely on. Most wealth isn't stored as cash. "Electronic cash" is just a marketing pitch, but the truth is that we already have hundreds of solutions to that problem that work perfectly fine. What we don't have (or didn't, until Bitcoin) is a distributed, decentralized, global finance backbone. That's HUGE, economically speaking, although it isn't going to be visible to folks who don't have any wealth stored aside from what they keep in cash.

Fortunately you absolutely don’t need to take my word for it. If you put on your skeptic hat and spend 2 hours on the web looking for scientific evidence of the merits if TA you will be shocked at how little there is (basically none). You will also be shocked at how many books, web sites, classes and expert news and analysis sites there are, but none of them offer any guarantees or detailed statistical analyses of their own historical success. Lots of TA ‘experts’ point to one or two great calls that they’ve made as proof, but they don’t offer a full view of all their trades and their overall performance versus the market. 
What made this so hard for me was this idea that “Surely this many people can’t be COMPLETELY wrong - there must be SOME truth to it.”
As it turns out, there are many, many belief systems that are really popular but have no objective merit whatsoever. Zero. That’s not uncommon at all. My expectation is the problem: human cognitive biases run really, really deep. It takes a crap-ton of effort to see them in your own thinking.

\~2/3 of the electricity generated is typically wasted. This is because we can't store it and can't turn the power generators up/down as demand varies seasonally, weekly or hourly (coal, oil, nuclear, hydro). This "waste" electricity is difficult to use, because there are very few industrial uses which can easily be ramped up/down in harmony with fluctuating demand from other users. PoW crypto mining is a rare example of one such use which can be done entirely with "waste" electricity - you can hash when the power is cheap, and turn the rigs off when power cost rises above the fixed costs for billing and transmission infrastructure. In reality, Bitcoin is an ideal way to use our surplus power and it is not at all clear that Bitcoin is a significant source of \*new\* carbon emissions. In fact, it may be the best way to reduce the energy costs of legacy financial services computing infrastructure (which the BTC network replaces) that cannot be deployed and operated with the same flexibility.

When you invest in something, you have a hypothesis about what it will be worth at some point in the future when you will need/plan to sell it. Timing is everything. The price of all assets that are traded on markets goes up and down due to unforeseeable events, and it isn't possible to predict a particular price move (unless you manipulate the market). People who watch the price of an asset but don't have any particular time-frame in mind for selling it get trapped in the 'narrative illusion'. Imagined trends are analogous to 'lucky streaks' - they don't exist, but the perception of them drives people to turn unrealized losses into actual losses. The safest way to avoid this is to be very clear with yourself about your initial investing hypothesis and the fact that you have not actually suffered a loss until you realize it. 
I bought BTC at $6900, with a plan to hold it for a day. When it fell to $6850 I had lost nothing, because I didn't sell. When it went to $6950 I sold it and realized a gain.
@_date: 2018-05-31 18:49:02
You mean "crypto coins a tokens", not "facets", right? 
In any case, your results aren't surprising, nor bad \(necessarily\). Trying to time bottom &amp; tops is a great way to lose money, so even a prudent investors end up underwater on specific buys fairly often, at least for a little while. The only real question is where prices will be when you need/plan to exit those positions. The time frame you establish for an investment \*before you buy\* is your most critical decision. Opportunistic speculation \(buy when it seems cheap, sell when the price has gone up\) is notoriously impractical as a strategy for accruing wealth \- it drives people to obsession and irrationality.
Smaller market cap coins/tokens rise and fall faster than larger market cap coins/tokens, as a general rule. When BTC stumbles, smaller coins/tokens tend to plummet. When capital starts flowing back in to this asset class, the conservative \(relatively\) wealth goes into BTC first and the less risk\-averse wealth goes to the more volatile end of the spectrum.
I don't like portfolios that are built using an arbitrary allocation based on price\+ trading volume\+market cap because that strategy ignores the fundamentals of each asset \(which are starting to matter quite a bit, now that  crypto investors, as a group, are maturing\).
If this were my portfolio, I would do some research on each of these tokens and craft a calendar of upcoming events that are likely to change the prices of each \(like mainnet launches, partnerships taking off, major conferences or community meetings, external events in capital markets like interest rate decisions, etc.\). Then I would start thinking about when \- and at what price \- I would exit each position. I would plan to exit back to BTC as the upward momentum in this asset class looks closer to cresting, and then exit BTC to fiat only with generous stops or if something truly catastrophic happens to the overall market. My calendar would probably look ahead no more than 12 months, but I would update it fairly regularly. I wouldn't watch prices much between the calendar events I was tracking. \(Note: this isn't investing advice and you have to make up your own mind about what you want to do with your wealth\).

The US wastes 2/3 of all the electricity we generate because we can't find productive things to do with it (off-peak). Bitcoin miners use the electricity that's of no use to anyone else. [~~ isn't creating an energy problem, it is solving one. 
Bitcoin presents us with an opportunity to power the core of the next-generation global financial system using follow-the-sun, off-peak 'waste' electricity. In fact, this is what will happen organically, since mining follows cheap electricity. Cheap electricity is the off-peak electricity that our power generation facilities produce even when we are all sleeping and the lights are off because we can't start up and stop power generators fast enough to closely track daily energy use. It takes hours, days or weeks to get coal, oil, hydro, wind and solar plants running and just as long to turn them 'down' when we don't need the power, so for many hours every day we have huge generators putting electricity on the grid even though no one is awake or working and using that electricity. If we had batteries we could save it for later, but batteries at that scale would be fantastically expensive and hard to build, maintain.
Fortunately, there is another way to get some value from that 'waste' electricity: powering our new Bitcoin-based financial system.
As the generational improvements in mining hardware TH/kWh flatten out and the useful life of mining gear gets longer and longer it will become cost effective to deploy mining hardware \*wherever\* there is occasional off-peak waste electricity. When the nominal cost of electricity at any generating site drops to the cost of transmission and billing infrastructure, the miners will come on-line and use that waste electricity. We won't need to build new power plants, new transmission lines or emit additional CO2. We'll just make better use of what we already have.
Even today, Bitcoin isn't really driving the production of net-new CO2, nor the construction of new power generation capacity except in rare cases where governments and large investors are taking advantage of short-lived imbalances in resources and regulatory favoritism. This is a blip and it will pass.
In the long term, Bitcoin (any PoW) gives us a way to replace vast amounts of clunky legacy banking infrastructure that consumes peak electricity (the expensive kind) with a globally distributed mining infrastructure that uses off-peak power instead. It will save us money and reduce carbon emissions.

Outlier. Maybe they got lucky. Maybe they used other means to supplement their decision-making. I’m looking for real, empirical evidence. Actual science. 
Have you noticed how little there is? 
If chart reading is predictive, shouldn’t it be easy to test the methods of prediction? Shouldn’t all people who use TA on the same data set arrive at the same conclusions? Shouldn’t it be easy to review historical predictions to measure the accuracy of analysis? Why is it that chart readers don’t do this as a matter of course? 
When you’re reading a book about TA, why don’t the authors offer a statistical (probabilistic) quantification of each pattern or metric? Shouldn’t it be possible to say that “xx% of the time the Head-and-Shoulders pattern correctly indicates a price move of xx%”, or some similar statement? Why doesn’t anyone offer a quantitative description of a “head” and a “shoulder”? 
If you used only chart data, and crafted an algorithm that was able to correctly trade even 1% more accurately than the next best alternative, how many trades would you have to make before you won all the wealth in the market? Do you have a guess about why that hasn’t happened, despite centuries of trading and millions of traders looking for this magical, unfair advantage? TA is the result of human cognitive biases. Like ghosts, angels, gods and monsters. Emotionally appealing, but otherwise worthless.

Sure, I think it has something to do with the way you think about wealth and your relationships to institutions that underpin it. People without much wealth tend to equate wealth and money, and think that banks make their profits by providing bank accounts. If you’re looking at it from that perspective, Bitcoin can replace cash and the retail banking experience and there are some strong societal implications of that which they find exciting. People with more wealth tend to think about wealth as a more abstract, nuanced thing and are more aware of the connections between fiscal and monetary policy, inflation, debt markets and equities and other stuff like that. For them, Bitcoin is a new financial instrument that bring some unique value to the mix, but it doesn’t necessarily make everything else obsolete and it doesn’t change their view of the world much. It’s just a new technology that makes gold obsolete.

If the “self fulfilling prophecy” hypothesis were true, there would be empirical evidence of it. If you can point me to actual empirical evidence of TA being useful I would appreciate it. Despite hundreds of years of people practicing TA, there is no more evidence that it works than there is for astrology, palmistry or any other comparable pseudoscience. Something isn’t true simply because many people believe it is. It is possible that some people believe that they made their fortunes by following the advice of oracles and fortune tellers, but that doesn’t mean they are correct. They may simply have guessed right - random chance is very hard for humans to see with the naked eye. We always prefer narratives and causation over random chance and intuitively see connections between things that don’t really exist. That’s why the scientific method was such a monumental innovation - without it we’d still be living in a world of spirits, gods and fairies.
@_date: 2018-08-31 13:36:42
Find some empirical evidence that there are any "self fulfilling prophecies". You don't need to disagree with me. You just need to find some scientific evidence that TA works. After looking for years I discovered that the explanation for why TA even exists is found in the science of behavioral economics and human cognition. It doesn't work, it never worked, but we are strongly biased toward finding patterns in randomness. We are compulsively drawn to narrative explanations for the things we see and TA is a byproduct of that. If you give a human a bunch of market data they will always find patterns and they will always avoid doing any probabilistic analysis of their patterns because we suck at estimating probabilities and we want the story to be true. It's the way human brains work. The same forces that drove us to invent god, astrology and faeries are behind phenomena like anti-vaxxer-ism, homeopathy, and TA.

TA is complete hogwash. It has zero proven predictive power. It is a parlor game, like tarot cards or Ouija boards. Play it for fun, but never for profit. Anyone who makes calls based on TA is destined to be laughed at - even if they're lucky once in a while, their results will regress to the mean. It's inescapable. If you make a lucky call walk away and never come back. If you try again, the odds are good that you won't improve your track record. That's what all the pros do - build a twitter following on a few lucky calls and cash out that way.

The UK Intellectual Property Office database provides the details on all existing trademarks. Search it here: [
To challenge a trademark in the UK, read this: [
Here is the guidance on opposing a registered trademark \(cut/paste\):
"**Opposing a registered trade mark**
Once a trade mark has been registered there are several different forms of legal action you can take to challenge it.
 Invalidation
Invalidation is the legal procedure, which allows anyone to try and remove a trade mark from our register as if it had never been registered. You can apply to remove the entire registration, or only some of the goods or services that it covers. You will need to send us a [form TM26\(I\)](
Further [guidance]( on invalidation is available.
 Revocation
Revocation is the legal procedure that allows anyone to try and remove a trade mark from the UK register. You can apply to remove the entire registration, or only some of the goods or services that it covers.
Usually, you would apply to revoke a trade mark on the grounds of non\-use, but there are other grounds for revocation. You will need to send us a:
* [form TM26\(N\)]( ‘Application to revoke a registration or a protected international trade mark \(UK\) for reasons of non\-use’ and statement of grounds
* [form TM26\(O\)]( ‘Application to revoke a registration or a protected international trade mark \(UK\) for reasons other than non\-use’ and statement of grounds
Further [guidance]( on revocation is available.
 Rectification
Rectification is the legal procedure which allows anyone to apply to correct \(or rectify\) an error or an omission that has been made in the recorded details of a registered trade mark. You will need to send us a [form TM26\(R\)](
Further [guidance]( on rectification is available.
 Intervention
Anyone, other than the proprietor, who claims to have an interest in a registered trade mark may apply to become involved \(in legal words ‘intervene’\) in post registration legal actions. You will need to send us a [form TM27](
A person with an interest in a registered trade mark may be:
* a subsidiary or related company of the proprietor or licensee of the proprietor who uses the mark itself
* a new owner of the trade mark who has not yet recorded their ownership in the register"

If you are a public company and have to report results, then you use this 'mark it to market' practice to provide transparency into the current value of assets. If you don't need to produce a report for anyone else to see, then you don't need this particular type of accounting. No matter what you have paid for something, you haven't lost anything unless and until you sell it for less. For most retail investors, 'mark it to market' is definitely not a necessary practice, and is arguably unhelpful, given that it's only purpose is to act as an emotional trigger.

The BTC network adjusts the difficulty of new blocks every 2016 to ensure that, on average, new blocks will take 10 minutes to mine. The 10 minute number comes from an example in Satoshi Nakamoto's paper. For details, read this great explanation on medium:

Right on. The design of the Bitcoin blockchain is (deliberately) biased toward a (1) healthy and decentralized mining community and (2) security and determinism. Latency (the time it takes to irretrievably commit a transaction) is far too long for point-of-sale retail transactions. Increasing block size (like BCH) is only a way to increase throughput (the number of transactions that can be confirmed in a block) every 10 minutes, but they all still take 10 minutes or longer. Bitcoin isn't "electronic cash". It's much more important than that.

I was referring to the endless debate about this: some folks seem concerned exclusively with the 'digital cash' case and other folks are not at all \(like me, for example\). I noticed that many of the folks who are arguing for large blocks seems concerned with fees, and therefore with the 'digital cash' case. They also seemed to generally be very young, and had no significant wealth to 'store'. I care about this because the storing vs. spending distinction has implications for the technology and the ecosystem. I am looking for a better way to think about \(estimation and prediction\) who is concerned with what type of usage.

So here's the thing: a chart is just a visualization of a bunch of data. Any valid pattern that a human eye can discern in such a visualization could also be discerned with an algorithm that analyzes that data. The predictive value of discovered patters could also be easily determined with simple maths. TA doesn't rely on this form of mathematical analysis, however, since the patterns that TA is concerned with necessarily require an element of  "creativity" in their discernment. Without the added magic of this 'imaginary' content, TA doesn't 'work', meaning that it isn't interesting. Herein lies the essence of TA: it is entertainment, not science. It avoids test\-ability because such tests run counter to it's essential value. Making predictions that can be challenged in the moment with mathematics makes it harder for the audience to suspend disbelief and therefore makes the TA less interesting to it's audience. It is a pseudoscience with a function similar to astrology, homeopathy, acupuncture, tarot card reading, palmistry, iChing or dowsing.

I have spent the last year wondering why more folks weren't focusing on the competition between SWIFT and Bitcoin as a funds transfer infrastructure. It always seemed to me that it was a good fit. When I moved $20k to Luxembourg in 20 minutes for $4.50 by sending it as BTC I saved myself a bunch of paperwork, 20 hours and $40 in fees. For non US banks, I imagine that the combination of higher fees and more volatile local currencies makes the business case even better.

I studied TA for 6 months, but I got annoyed when I couldn't find any probabilistic data on different chart patterns. Nobody could tell me what the probabilities were for simple stuff like resistance levels. Nobody could explain to me why 10 different analysts could come up with 10 different numbers for a resistance level even though we all have the same data to work from. I started doing more research and our firm even hired 2 intern mathematicians to work on a study of our trading platform. 
They tried to explain to the traders why TA didn't work, but the traders couldn't believe that the patterns they were seeing didn't actually exist. If you know any day traders, you can probably imagine how dismissive they were. The fact remains that one of our traders did better and outperformed the market, the others under-performed. They all had the same tools and they were all true believers, but over time, they all regressed to the mean and were not outperforming the traders that *never* looked at a stock chart or did any sort of TA at all. 
If you talk to some insiders in the larger firms I think you'd find that this is a common pattern. Folks who outperform are welcome to blame it on anything they like: God, TA, Magic 8-Ball, lucky rabbit's foot, etc. Much of the time a reputation is built on nothing more than one or two lucky bets early on, but over time all day traders regress to the mean.
This isn't how my company works, but I have heard it suggested that some firms use TA as an excuse for kicking up a lot of trades to obscure the trades that are actually driven by insider information. If an investigator looks at the data and asks why a trade was made, they just point to some chart patterns and all the other noisy trading they've done. Makes it very hard to spot.

We humans make our decisions first then look look for as much proof as we feel we need to have at had in case someone wants to disagree and have an argument about it. We never have open minds without some serious, rigorous, effort and discipline.

This is a pretty good article: 
Quote: 
"For beginners, let’s begin by saying that the total number of atoms in the entire universe is 2\^²⁶⁶.
Doing little calculations (not so little), we get that if a supercomputer that can perform 15 trillion calculations per second is employed in cracking the hash, it would take almost **0.65 billion billion** years to crack the hash of a single Bitcoin address. Yeah, that sentence had two consecutive “billions”.
Now, according to *Moore’s law*, electronics (and hence computing) power will increase with time, and new advancements in the field of Quantum computers (Computers that works on the principles of quantum mechanics) would be able to beat the problem of reversing the hash.
But even if a Quantum computer is employed, it would still take 10\^ **³²** years to calculate one hash. The public key is passed through numerous one way hash functions which are essentially quantum-resistant."

Yes, you are right. The investments in new hardware happen far in advance and are a sunk cost. The new machines will be put in service. If we (miners) need to cut costs the first thing we do is decommission older hardware (ideally it's fully depreciated already). The miners that are in high-cost locations will drop off first, and harshrate will shift to pools where the costs of operation are lowest. If that trimming of the high-cost miners and old hardware isn't enough, the miners will start looking for outside investment for operating cash (borrowing against their BTC and future profits). If that starts to dry up, they will start powering down new hardware.
@_date: 2018-06-12 14:00:05
You have it right. The premise is that the large institutional investors don't care about the price in the short term. They want to let it keep falling until they see the bottom. The 'bottom' is the price where the miners start turning off hashrate, new miners stop popping up, the equipment makers start walking away, etc.

That could be so. There is certainly enough small money floating around to double or triple the exchange value of BTC with the right conditions. I would expect it to be pretty volatile, though, with FOMO in and out. We saw $20k on relatively limited supply and a huge FOMO from the small money. Since then, the supply has increased dramatically and the novelty has worn off. It would be hard to get back to that level without an influx of some large money. I think that may be starting to happen soon; months, not years.

I don't think the block reward has anything to do with it. I think the gist of the thread is that institutional investors are watching the network for signs that the exchange value of BTC has reached the floor. Until then, and possibly for a while after, they will continue to accumulate at a rate that doesn't cause price appreciation.

Good observation. Looking at these sorts of metrics is really enlightening. It’s hard to put a specific value target for the “bottom” of each (Google rank, price decline, tweets/day, etc,) so I generally make two assumptions: diminishing rate of decline signals approach toward bottom and (2) the macro environments for each indicator aren’t changing for external reasons (i.e. 1/2 the Twitter references because the number of Twitter users has fallen by 1/2 across the board).

By "own" you mean "control", right? Clearly large state banks and hedge funds and other major institutions can move enough wealth to buy all the BTC that will ever be for sale. The top 5 global commercial banks alone could buy every BTC on the market if they wanted to, even at 10X the current price. It is preposterous to think that the large financial institutions won't end up owning \~90&amp; of all BTC (assuming it survives). We can certainly debate to extent to which that gives them "control".

You make an interesting point: "prices are prone to manipulation". There is an inescapable truth to this. If you are an individual or an institution trying to buy or sell $1 billion worth of BTC, it's almost impossible for you to avoid moving the market. [As of today there are approximately 60 corporations with market caps bigger than BTC]( From the perspective of a hedge fund like Bridgewater, the BTC markets are too small to be sufficiently liquid and are too easily influenced by significant buys. I think all of the institutionl investors would like to see the cap go way, way up with lots more users, transactions &amp; miners.

Right. I get the basic idea. Like I mentioned, though, the miners are only adding about 1.8k BTC per day via block rewards. Daily trading volume is \~60\-80k BTC, so that 1.8k represents a small percentage change in supply (2\-3&amp; \- certainly not enough to move the price very dramatically. I wouldn't expect a 1.5&amp; change in supply to suddenly move the price much (or maybe not at all, at this point).
@_date: 2018-06-12 14:29:26
Miners only process transactions because of the fees and block rewards. Full nodes aren't essential to the network. Yes, the network can continue to operate with a decline in hashrate, but a declining hashrate would tell us something about the fundamental economic viability of mining: it's gotten less appealing, rather than more. The long\-term viability of BTC is dependent on the health of the network and the communities of miners that run it. If the price falls so low that the miners start moving capacity elsewhere, then we know the price is 'bottom'.

Agreed. That's why the debate about BTC fees vs. BCH fees isn't relevant to end users \- if fee costs are the primary issue, then there are other ways of transacting value that have lower fees than either of them. Fees are a red herring issue used in Bitcoin's sibling rivalry that distracts attention from other, more relevant differences. This particular comparison muddies the water, more than it clarifies.

Like I said: it's arbitrary. Gold was selected back before platinum was a "thing". Gold jewelry is just a way of storing wealth in gold, except you do it in a way that shows other people how much gold you have. Jewelry is made from gold because gold is valuable, not the other way around. The tradition of wearing your started thousands of years ago when gold was selected as the best trans\-cultural store of wealth. It was necessary to have something easier to handle than trade goods in order to facilitate trade expansion.

Well, I wouldn't read it that way. If you wanted to boil it down to one key point I'd say it is "don't bother buying until the price falls so low that the network starts to erode". This isn't my advice, mind you; it's just an observation about how large institutional investors (may) view the BTC price.
@_date: 2018-06-11 14:00:50
It's normal. There are 3 types of users for BTC right now: (1) Money\-senders, (2) Savers and (3) Speculators. Money senders don't care about the long\-term trend or price of a coin, but they need the price to be stable long enough to send some value to someone else. Savers don't care about short\-term (hours) fluctuations, but they definitely don't want the value to go down over the long term (years). Traders care about daily price changes and are the folks driving the trading volume right now, sending it up wildly one day and dumping the next to take profits. 
We are in a consolidation phase right now where the largest traders are pumping and then dumping, rinse\-and\-repeat, trying to suck the last drops of cash out of the small\-time traders. The market fundamentals are driven by the Money\-senders and Savers, but those folks are scared away by volatility, so I would expect things to continue to flatten (no big, sustained pumps) for a few more months. Once the regulatory stuff starts to shape up (clarity and uniformity) and the payments infrastructure starts to get more widely rolled out then those users will start to come back and add to the market cap again. that will bring the price back up over the next few years (hopefully in a nice smooth way, a few percent a month, with daily volatility less than 3&amp;
@_date: 2018-06-13 15:27:23
Yes, I agree with you. I think the floor is the cost of production. When hashrate stops growing that will be a sure sign that BTC exchange value is bottoming. Prior to that, game theory still rules the price.
@_date: 2018-06-13 19:04:49
Yes, I think the term 'floor' is used pretty liberally and could be confusing. I tend to think of it in same way I would for a manufactured good, where the floor is essentially the COGS. In this case, that would be whatever price was necessary to sustain the producers \- the network of miners.
I don't think it's a game of chicken. I think the large institutional investors expect the money needed to prop up the miners and the ecosystem (hardware vendors, exchanges &amp; infrastructure investors, big tech. players &amp; VCs) to flow in indirectly \- not via the BTC price but via direct investment in gear\-maker IPOs, construction of new cost\-efficient facilities, and so forth. I also don't believe they don't expect an influx of speculative money to suddenly drive the BTC exchange value up either (where would that sudden influx of money come from?), but they are watching the network for clues about when to start ramping up their accumulation. 
It was put to me this way: if you're looking for a reason for anything to change wrt the BTC exchange price, what would it be? Regulation? User adoption? Sentiment? Sure, all of those, but you also want to keep an eye on the infrastructure and supporting ecosystem. When the network starts to show signs of stress, you know you are seeing something meaningful \- it's a bellwether.

I agree with your general assertion. I just have a hard time seeing how a change in supply this small is going to move the exchange value of BTC very much. It seems to me that there are many, many considerations that are likely to have a much bigger impact.

Sure! As good as any other educated guess, I suppose.
@_date: 2018-06-12 19:04:08
No, I think the idea is that the price will fall to a level that makes the investment in mining sufficiently unappealing that total hashrate stops growing or even starts to decline. You can observe the [hashrate and distribution of mining capacity]( in near\-real\-time.
For most miners, their ASIC hardware is designed to support a particular algorithm, so a machine that can hash SHA\-256 could theoretically be re\-purposed to mine blocks for any blockchain that uses that algorithm (i.e. Bitcoin Cash or whatever). Aside from that, the main costs are the network and data center infrastructure, the mining hardware and power.
It is true that they could just turn off the power, or switch to some other blockchain. It's not obvious, though, what other SHA\-256 blockchains are actually more valuable to mine than BTC, since when BTC exchange price falls, the other SHA\-256 coins tend to fall with it (or even faster). And the hardware still has a cost that has to be recovered for the investment case to work.
In reality, BTC mining investments are fairly rigid and need to be planned around a 6\-12 month hardware depreciation schedule and a fairly stable \- or at least likely average \- exchange value of BTC. This depreciation period could get longer as the rate of advancement of new ASIC miners slows (like not being able to get to 7nm chips in volume).
@_date: 2018-06-13 16:57:56
Hashrate, number of mining nodes, number of pools, distribution of hashrate to pools. Full nodes don't really matter as an indicator of health. 
The notion that "history repeats itself" is not as useful as it seems. Humans evolved a strong affinity for patterns because it helped us avoid making the same dumb mistakes over and over. On the other hand, we see patterns everywhere and rarely try to test their predictive value. It's one of the reasons we are so susceptible to magical thinking. That's why we use the scientific method to establish causation. Correlation is abundant, and usually meaningless.
@_date: 2018-06-12 05:11:05
Right. Only 1.8k BTC are created each day, which is 2\-3 percent of [daily trade volume of \~20\-40k]( BTC (and a minuscule percentage of the total \~12\-14 million BTC available to trade). If the block reward drops from 2\-3&amp; to 1\-1.5&amp; then we would see BTC market prices squeeze up enough to draw an additional 1\-1.5&amp; BTC into the market to replace the halved rewards. I'm not certain how much the price would need to increase to cover that gap, but it probably wouldn't be much. I'm not sure 'the halvening' will be a big price\-altering event.

I'll bet the Bitmain IPO \- if it works out \- will open up a lot more money from the major VCs and tech players. If making the infrastructure becomes a viable business at the scale we're seeing (with companies like Coinbase, Binance, Huobi), I bet you'll see more Tech players enter. 
BTC may replaces certain bank accounts, treasuries, REITs &amp; precious metals in investment portfolios.  It should also naturally increase in value as the economy grows over time and more BTC are lost than are mined. 
I think BTC exchange prices will become less volatile as the law of large numbers starts showing itself more clearly. For that, we need tens of millions of daily buyers and sellers (many times more than we have now) and lots of trades being timed based on the utility of the transaction, not speculation (i.e. I need to spend BTC because I have to pay my electricity bill tomorrow, or maybe pay my rent). More types of users in more countries, more time zones, more connections to physical resources and real economic activity. When that happens, speculation will become a decreasingly important component of the BTC exchange value.

BTC's properties are even better, since it is also intrinsically secure and is exceptionally easy to transfer.

We are not capable of doing statistical analysis in our heads because it's too hard \- simple heuristics are more practical and generally useful, although they can be wrong consistently when misapplied.

Not all things happen for a reason and history often does not repeat itself. Sometimes shit just is.
@_date: 2018-06-19 02:19:20
I think they (we) will be looking for two things, to find a hard cost floor for BTC (i.e. the price that reflects break-even for the current network operators):
(1) flattening out of hashrate growth trend (probably because miners get more aggressive about decommissioning older mining hardware that’s less efficient and may be fully depreciated already)
(2) a shift of hashrate to mining pools which are known to be concentrated in geographies with the lowest electricity &amp; facilities costs or other substantial competitive advantages
When those things happen I believe you will have some proof that the price (say, on a 3 month rolling average) is at the bottom in terms of viability at the current scale of the network.
Just my thinking, here. I don’t have any direct info at this level of detail.

It seem to me that the SEC has already been clear about Bitcoin being an asset and not a security. I don’t think we should necessarily conflate Bitcoin with other similar, but different, projects.

I think the key for me was the answer to the question of when to buy and what to expect for the following months or years. Looking at the miners was the big insight: the price will probably fall until it looks like the network may be at risk, and when it does, start accumulating and don't expect dramatic price appreciation for a while. I'd like to be in a discussion about what metrics, exactly, we would want to use to measure the health of the network. Hashrate? Number of pools? Distribution of block rewards to pools? 
@_date: 2018-06-05 16:00:51
Yes, as long as you're talking $/byte and $/tx then you're talking about the same thing. 1 BTC Sat is \~7x more $USD than 1 BCH Sat \(as of today\). Saying that they have comparable Sat/byte costs isn't relevant to end users, because the $USD cost of the fees, expressed in Sat, will still be wildly different.

The floor for BTC is the amount of value in the network required to support the number of in\-flight transactions happening at any given time. The only folks who leave wealth in BTC for longer than it takes to move it are the people who (1) expect to transfer it again shortly, (2) have no better currency available for short\-term storage or (3) hope it will go up in value again sometime in the future. The latter dominates the market cap at this point, and that's why the price is most easily understood using game theory ([ 
The bottom will come when everyone on this /r/ has gone home and no longer gives a damn about the price. If you want to buy in at the bottom, remember that you'll be the only idiot you know who would even think of buying BTC on the day you do it \- you will feel mighty lonely. You will have watched some exchanges close, some news sites shut down, the number of active folks on this /r/ drop by 4/5, the twitter\-verse go silent on BTC and the media start running BTC retrospectives.

You mean like gold, bonds, treasuries, REITs? There is a reason why most of the wealth in existence isn't currency: we don't need that much currency to facilitate day-to-day financial transactions.

@_date: 2018-06-12 16:00:11

Why are you waiting for that? Daily miner output is only equal to 2\-3&amp; of trading volume, so if it gets cut in half it will only be a 1\-1.5&amp; difference in supply, which would have a small effect on the price/value (if any at all, given daily volatility is much, much larger than that).

@_date: 2018-06-07 13:52:34
BTC is not for street\-retail payments for small items. That's a capability that LN is adding. BTC was used this way in the early years because BTC used to allow confirmation\-less transactions, wherein the network would acknowledge the transaction had been received, but not confirmed in a block on the blockchain (this would happen later). The merchant took all the risk while waiting for the confirmation. This uses a feature of the protocol called '0\-conf' which is still used by Bitcoin Cash (otherwise that fork's argument about low\-fee 'Digital Cash' would collapse). But '0\-conf' is generally a bad idea because it requires complete trust between the parties executing the transaction (the seller takes all the risk) and is not suitable for widespread, macro\-economically significant use of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-06-13 15:06:52
Institutional investors (like the rest of us) are looking for clues about some imminent change in the fundamentals that will affect the trading direction of BTC. Many of these investors also believe that the value of BTC is the network and the ecosystem that supports it, rather than the actual contents of the BTC blockchain. By this logic, as long as the BTC network is healthy, there is no problem with the exchange value BTC, since it only needs to be high enough to keep the network alive and growing. This is unrelated to the game theory around pricing scarce goods. 
If the exchange price of BTC stays too low for too long the miners who operate the BTC network will react, and their reaction is what we want to watch for. 
Miners sell their BTC to cover their costs for hardware, data center space, power and other business expenses. They sell either when they think the price is good or when they absolutely need cash. If the price drops too low and stays too low they will eventually have to sell their BTC even if they don't want to. Before they get that far, however, it is likely that they will start turning off older hardware that isn't as efficient as newer hardware. Most miners have already ordered some newer hardware and will likely continue to deploy it (it's a sunk cost), which will offset the loss of the older machines. All of this would look like a [slowing in the growth of the BTC network hashrate]( If the prices continue to stay below the level that can generate enough profit for the miners, we would potentially see the hashrate drop. 
This is the "floor" price if BTC, since it is essentially the cost of production of the BTC blockchain.

For an institutional investor $1 billion isn't all that much wealth to invest, and even that amount is hard to buy without moving the market price for BTC. I don't know whether that's "manipulation", in the sense that you mean.
Think about it this way: investing $1 billion would require buying 150k BTC (at today's exchange value). The global trade volume is 20\-40k BTC per day. If you were to buy 5&amp; of the global daily volume of BTC sold, you would have to buy for more than 50 days just to invest your $1 billion, and that would tighten supply by a pretty significant amount, which would probably drive the price up pretty substantially.
There are hundreds of institutions that would invest $1 billion in this asset class once the regulations and infrastructure were sound and the price floor had been found.
@_date: 2018-06-13 17:31:18
No. The price can fall below the floor. The floor is the point at which the price becomes a negative pressure on the viability of the network, which is the foundation of the value of BTC. If the price drops below the floor the network starts to diminish \*because\* the price has fallen, and the diminishment of the network creates downward pressure on the price. When the price is above this level it is affected by other factors, but not this one. When it falls below  the floor all of the other facts are still in play, but this network diminishment becomes a new factor. It is a threshold.

The intent of the headline of the thread is obvious: BCH supporters claim that BTC transaction fees were too expensive for small value transactions and that’s why they advocate for larger blocks, so BTC supporters want to take the air out of that complaint by showing that BTC fees are lower than BCH. Counting fees in sat/byte is a tricky way of trying to take the air out of that complaint. I’m not advocating for BCH, but it isn’t useful to try and be tricky about how you interpret “cost”. Everyone knows what the debate is about, and BTC transaction fees are not, really, lower than BCH. I know this is a hyper-tribal thing and I know I’m just begging for blowback by pointing this out, but BTC fans are better off not making this argument, IMO.

I think the idea is that you know you have 'bottom' when the price is too low for the miners and they stop deploying hashrate, the pools start consolidating, miners start exiting, mining equipment manufacturers start failing or scaling back production. Institutional investors are more than happy to stay on the sidelines, or even sell to bring the price down lower in order to help ind bottom. They have no incentive to buy yet. When they do buy, they will be trying to amass share of BTC, not actively trade their coins.

DCA down, lowers the cost basis. Applies to equities (or whatever) as well.
@_date: 2018-06-12 20:06:10
You mean that the required hashrate to mine a block will continue to increase, making older hardware too inefficient to be profitable? Yes, that is absolutely the imminent risk. If the price falls low enough for long enough, older ASIC hardware will be decommissioned and deployment of new gear will slow, eventually causing the aggregate hashrate of the network to flatten and then start shrinking. This is the best possible way to know that the BTC exchange value has fallen to it’s floor. If it goes below this point and hashrate falls long enough, there will be an incrementally increasing risk that BTC goes to $0 (falls below the floor).
The initial post was all about this point, and argues that the large money (institutional investors) are watching and waiting for network growth to slow to a near-stop. They are in no hurry to prop up the price. They are happy to acquire more BTC near the value floor and don’t care if the market value of a BTC goes up any time soon. They only care about acquiring a larger share of the blockchain right now.
Anhow, this is what I was told, and the more I think about it the more I believe it is accurate.

I said "by" \~900 coins, not "to" \~900 coins. Miners are adding \~1,800 BTC per day to the current supply, which is \~14 million. After the block reward is halved they will only be adding \~900 per day to the supply (of \~14 million). It's an extremely small change. It's barely even 1\-2&amp; of daily trading volume and is less than 0.00007&amp; daily change in BTC supply.
@_date: 2018-06-12 16:52:42
Totally agree with the adoption point. Ideally, we want BTC to be maximally distributed, with many, many miners in many jurisdictions and geographies using gear and facilities from many different providers. We want hundreds of millions of people and businesses using it daily for as many purposes as possible, with as many of those transactions as possible driven by trade (rather than speculation, i.e. buying houses, cars, paying rent, paying the light bill, collecting salary, etc.). The bigger the network and the more hooks into the real economy the less volatile and more valuable BTC will become. The inflow of significant global wealth will happen because of this expansion of the network/ecosystem but it will also drive this expansion. I don't think we've seen that virtuous cycle really kick in yet. The BTC market cap is very, very tiny right now. This whole project is still an experiment, but it is making progress. Looking at the price right now is somewhat distracting \- the real signs of success or failure are elsewhere.

Banks are not afraid of Bitcoin. They will happily use it once they feel it is sufficiently mature. Bitcoin is not a threat to the banking industry. They are aware of how it could reduce government involvement in their business and lower their costs. They will still trade assets, they will make loans, they will offer on-line bill payment services, they will process mortgages and provide credit cards. Bitcoin isn't going to take away their businesses, nor alter their business models. They don't make much money on operating checking accounts anyhow, and as far as I can tell that's the only thing that Bitcoin directly disrupts.

@_date: 2018-06-12 21:01:12
The same economics applies to all networks \- somehow they have to pay for themselves. It's just that with BTC we can see key network stats and costs pretty clearly, but with other tokens/coins we can't, so it's not possible to use that data as the basis for any sort of analysis.
@_date: 2018-06-12 14:25:16
I don't think the idea is that this is a conspiracy or anything like that. It's just a very simple observation: Institutional investors don't care about the price and are happy to watch the exchange value fall until it hits bottom. Bottom is when the network starts to suffer because of the low price. That's all.
@_date: 2018-06-19 13:42:58
his chart seems to imply that trades are just another measure of interest in the topic "Bitcoin", which is bad. Ideally, trades should be tied to economic activity, not interest in BTC as a topic of discussion. This makes me a bit sad, and leads me to think that the BTC price may still merely be a reflection of speculator sentiment, rather than utility as a value store/payment technology. Of course, it could be that folks talk more about something they are investing their resources in (or are otherwise using more), so perhaps it's not that clear-cut.
@_date: 2018-06-13 20:53:45
No, supply won't drop by 1/2. Supply will increase by \~900 coins per day, rather than \~1,800 coins. Current trade volume is 20,000\-40,000 BTC per day and there are \~14 million in circulation. The current block reward is only equal to 2\-3&amp; of trading volume. If you cut it in half, you only need the price to increase enough to draw 1\-1.5&amp; more coins into the market. Why would the price shoot up?
@_date: 2018-06-12 05:14:02
Ahh! Thanks. So you think 'HODL!' basically means "never trade for fiat!"?
@_date: 2018-06-12 19:41:37
Correct: miners don't sell every day. But their investment cases require some assumptions about future value of their block rewards plus the fees that they will collect from processing transactions (mining new blocks). When ROI falls sufficiently they will stop deploying new capacity (hashrate). 
The 'value' of the BTC blockchain is the network and the ecosystem that supports it. If the value falls below the cost of running the network, the network (and ecosystem) will shrink. When that happens, the 'floor' price for BTC will be clear. If the value falls below the floor, the value of network will also fall, therefore the value of each BTC will fall too.
I don't think anyone is talking about "games", aside from the game theory, here. It's just economics and business. No one is complaining about the distribution of ownership on this thread, as far as I can see.
@_date: 2018-06-12 19:16:15
I don't think anyone here is advocating for, or protesting, institutional investors. They are what they are and they will buy if they want to. There isn't anything that can be done to stop them, although I'm not sure why anyone would want to. I don't regard BTC as a "Fuck you" to anyone. It's just a technology and the ecosystem that supports it. It is what it is and it does what it does.

Holding out for the best price is what market participants do, by definition. I don't understand your comment "Bitcoin's value IS entirely due to holding." at all. What is it that you are trying to say?
Some institutional investors may be "in", but they aren't in very deep. The entire BTC market cap is only $115 billion, which is very, very, very small. Consider this: the top 15 US banks have $13.2 billion in assets under management and there are nearly 60 companies with market caps larger than BTC.

Most trading bots are simply order automation: they wait for pre\-set price levels to execute multi\-step, conditional orders. They don't use TA to predict the market: the person who sets the bot up has a prediction already in mind and the bot simply executes their trade plan. 
I have used bots extensively \- this is what led me to question TA in the first place. I felt like I was doing real work, coding and testing, but the results didn't show a meaningful benefit versus random chance. The community of folks I was a part of also seemed very excited about the bots they were building and had lots of stories about successful bots, but none of them were actually making money overall \- I realized that they were discounting the cases where the bots failed as "exploration" or "technical glitches". 
I think bots that do simple order automation (like automatic portfolio re\-balancing bots, or scalping bots that buy and sell on \~0.5&amp; fluctuations in a flat market) can be useful, as long as you watch them carefully. Bots that are built using complex patterns, like Ichimoku Clouds, can look very impressive on paper, and may even hit a run of good luck where the market moves in a way the bot can predict for a while. The same runs of good luck happen to people, though, and those bots don't outperform. They're just another way of getting the same result.
I think most novice traders (especially folks on some of the crypto trading boards) are of the mistaken belief that super\-sophisticated trading bots powered by TA are driving the markets. This is not at all the case.
@_date: 2018-06-12 17:09:28

Totally agree on speculative demand vs transactional. You nailed it. The transactional demand only requires short\-term price stability (1\-2 percent over a few hours or days may be OK).  The folks who just want to store value would like the price to drift up 1\-2 percent over a few months, or at least not really ever drop much. The speculators are the folks who actually want to drive the price up. I prefer to look at the price as an indicator of growth in aggregate social value of the endeavor.
@_date: 2018-06-12 22:50:04
I can't figure out why people think the halving of the block reward is going to do anything significant to drive the BTC exchange value up. The math doesn't work. The drop in supply is insignificant. IS it just a historical thing? A pattern from the past that folks hope will happen again?

@_date: 2018-06-05 13:41:28
Miners aren't the issue. The reason this "cheapest transaction" headline catches eyes is because BCH has made the case that high transaction costs drove BTC users away, so we're now arguing that BTC is "cheaper". But it isn't, at least not from the perspective of an end user of the coin. This particular argument is lame.

I don't know about gating, but [85&amp; of the world's accumulated wealth is under the control of financial institutions representing 10&amp; of the global population]( (including central banks). [The top 15 US banks alone control assets worth $13.2 trillion]( It is very hard to imagine a path forward for BTC that doesn't involve the major financial institutions finding a way to participate. The question I have is how, and when?
@_date: 2018-06-12 15:55:33
Agreed. I would guess that we are getting fairly close to bottom now, if the viability of mining is the measure. From what I can surmise, $5-6k seems like breakeven for most miners. If I were an institutional investor I would expect other institutions to start stepping in to prop up the price with a DCA program at around the exchange value that BTC is at now. It could linger at these levels for quite a while, though. Small-time speculators looking for a quick profit may still be buying or holding, but (based on my read of the institutional investor logic that was outlined to me) they will have their patience tested.

I never really understood the 'HODL!' meme. Are you really supposed to hold BTC forever? If so, then what's it for? Just collateral against which you can borrow fiat (like a bank would)? 
I've always thought that the best way to invest was based on the fundamentals and macroeconomics: Invest in the leading enterprises competing within an area of the economy that you think will increase in utility in the foreseeable future. I.e. investing in the top 10 global tech companies (each the leading player in their segments) because you believe the number of mobile computing device users will increase 10X in the next 10 years. 
Sort of timing the investment based on the fundamentals that you can actually foresee, whatever those may be case\-by\-case. The broad strokes aren't that hard to grasp, but you probably need to be in a position to be very patient in some cases. Long time\-frame for return and zero liquidity while you wait, or maybe a period of painful fluctuation in price with a duration you can only estimate in fiscal quarters or years.
@_date: 2018-06-12 16:42:00
I can only say that my firm has not recommended longing (buying) BTC to any customer that plans on exiting their position in the next 6 months to 1 year. We also have recommend against short positions. I don't think this qualifies as HODLing, but I wouldn't be using my paycheck to buy BTC hoping for a 2x pump the next day. It could happen, but I think we're entering a new era for BTC and the old patterns are less likely to be predictive than they might have been. Generally, I'm skeptical of the assumption that history repeats itself. I know it appears to, but that's (usually) more of a byproduct of pervasive cognitive bias on the part of the observer.

Block rewards are new BTC. [Miners are rewarded for processing new transactions (finding new blocks) with some brand\-new BTC that never existed before.]( The current rewards are about \~1,800 BTC per day of brand new BTC. When the block reward gets cut in half, that will drop to \~900 BTC. At the current price ($6,200) all of the BTC block rewards for the last 24 hours have an excahange value of about $11.1 million USD. Miners also get fees, of course. If we were to suddenly cut the block reward in half today that would only reduce the trade volume by a few percent at the most \- around $5.6 million USD at the current rate. 
When 'the halvening' happens it is not at all a given that there will be a tightening of supply of BTC, that will lead to a price increase. There is a good chance that miners will have to do something to deal with a loss of revenue, though. If the price doesn't go up, they may have to scale back hashrate (cut costs). 
I'm more worried about centralization of hashrate in the pools with the lowest operating costs than I am about a sudden price spike.
@_date: 2018-06-22 00:16:49
This is a really great observation and I agree with you completely. I'm fatigued by the conflation of 'blockchain' and 'bitcoin' in the media at large. Blockchain is nifty, but Bitcoin is an application that uses blockchain, and ithe real differentiating value of Bitcoin isn't in the blockchain, but in the other aspects of the protocol that create an internal economy that is intrinsically biased toward decentralization (consensus).
@_date: 2018-06-12 13:38:10
I'm still skeptical about it, but I guess we'll see when it happens.
@_date: 2018-06-28 06:32:16
We think that Bitcoin has unique value that goes beyond the blockchain tech. Blockchain without an internal economy like Bitcoin has (one that drives decentralization; is self-governing via consensus and is self-funding) is mostly just an encrypted, distributed database. Those exist in many flavors already, and many have significant advantages, especially performance.
@_date: 2018-06-12 18:51:49
I can't speak for 'people', but if you take wallets as a proxy, then it looks[ like \~50&amp; of all wallets have less than .001 BTC]( Now this is only for 12 million addresses, and folks who use the exchanges don't necessarily have their own wallets (Coinbase's 13 million users are all sharing a handful of them). In truth, there are only about \~14m BTC available to trade ([many are presumed or known to be lost, and more are lost every day](
@_date: 2018-06-19 03:01:24
Yeah, miners do tend to hold a lot of BTC when the price swings low. They are whales that get bigger every day, as we drop below the price minimum they were expecting when they built their business cases for investing in mining operations.  Different miners have different expectations because of operating cost differences (pretty wide gaps, as you note, between the lowest cost and highest cost miners).
If we see a flattening of hashrate and a shift of hashrate to pools that have substantial operating cost advantages then we should also prepare for a backlog of BTC being put on the market by the miners that just finished cost cutting and may need to start liquidating some of their holdings.
There are so many factors to consider that it feels a bit foolish to paint a scenario based on a narrow set of concerns, but if I saw the price drift low and stay range-bound with slowly decreasing volume, then saw hashrate growth flatten out and hashrate shift to low-cost pools, then I would be looking for a sharp dump from the miners that are capitulating. The price at that point, I would guess, was below the floor and in the next several days I would expect a fairly quick recovery to the cost floor (miners will scale back their selling as much as cash flow needs allow) and a period of low-volume trading again for a week or two while the market tests the network to see if it will correct and resume growth at the new price levels or whether it needs to contract further.
In some ways it sounds a lot like what we've been seeing over the last few months, but the hashrate has continued to grow. Perhaps it's a lagging indicator and we'll see that happen in the next month or two. Perhaps it's completely irrelevant and there is some larger force driving price changes. I cannot stress enough that this is all just educated guessing.
@_date: 2018-06-13 14:28:02
I don't think anyone knows for certain \- that's what we watch the aggregate hashrate to try and determine. Some people estimate that it is between $3.5k and $6.5k (global average).
@_date: 2018-06-13 20:27:27
We discussed the simple ones to interpret: drop in the increase in aggregate hashrate, shrinking number of mining pools, mirgration of hashrate/blocks to pools known to be in locales with the lowest operating costs. Those are all directly observable. Looking at the shipments of ASIC miners, postponement of releases of new miner hardware, cancellation or postponement of large mining projects, changes in the number of job postings by known miners (or maybe layoffs). All of these could be signs of 'weakening'.
On the other side, looking for signs of strengthening, even the continued lack of major investment announcements from big IT players is something of a clue. Why doesn't Amazon mine BTC as a cloud service? Why don't Intel or NVIDIA build ASICs? What are they waiting for? What's Samsung doing?

From the market’s perspective, a centra bank controls the money supply by creating and selling debt at will, and by destroying currency that it has purchased on the market. Controlling the supply allows the central banks to change the relative value of the money to account for changes in economic activity. Governments can help prop up demand by requiring all fees and taxes be payable in their currency, and by insisting that all public servants and suppliers/beneficiaries accept it as payment.
Central banks will have no choice but to buy and sell enough Bitcoin to influence supply. All of the central banks that currently have their own currencies will need to acquire the means to influence the supply of Bitcoin on the market. If they don’t, they will become vulnerable to other central banks that do. Currency valuation is a kind of never-ending economic battle between states. They all want stability, but constantly seek to gain maximum advantage without tipping over the applecart (in a manner of speaking).
I agree with your comment about banks being displaced by all-digital upstarts. That is happening already, independently from the merits and progress of Bitcoin.

I'm only tossing this out there because there seems to be a lot of fear and I want to present a contrarian perspective. As always, don't forget: if you haven't sold, you haven't lost anything because 1BTC is still 1BTC.
I am comfortable with USD/BTC exchange rates at these levels and am buying (DCA) starting today and running 7-10 days or so. The BTC/USD exchange rate may go down a little more, but I believe that this correction is still just shaking out the overly-exuberant speculators. There is a real 'user' base reflected in the BTC market cap: folks who are actually buying BTC as a savings account because they don't have access to traditional banking services or are using it for payments because they don't have access to a more stable/useable currency. My firm estimates that 'users' component of the BTC market cap, with an added $10B of hard-core HODL'rs to be about $100B. Based on a circulation of 14.7m BTC, we think $6-7k USD/BTC should be a floor based on fundamentals (to the extent we ultimately know what the full set of fundamental KPI are), and dips below this point represent over-correction.
This isn't investing advice and you always have to make up your own mind about how and when to invest. If you believe that BTC is facing new opportunities because it has made/is making significant technical advances (SegWit, Lightning fees/Tx times falling) or market advances (more potential users with accounts, consumer mind-share, regulatory progress, major new entrants like Samsung) that aren't priced in yet, you should look toward the end of this year for some solid growth above the current valuation. We believe that there will be more users as the year progresses and more legitimate service providers/retailers supporting Bitcoin as an option. If you also believe this and you don't need your investment back immediately, selling now only locks in losses. If you believe that BTC will dip further and want to take a risk on buying back in at the absolute bottom before the bounce, you can certainly try. Timing those things is really, really hard.

@_date: 2018-02-20 18:18:54
It is always good to bet on BTC volatility. Traders will not let something go up in a straight line to the moon. FOMO panic is usually followed by crash panic. 5% a month would be sustainable. 50% a month is probably not. I'm not all-in, just because it's impossible to tell when you are about to hit a short-term apex and drop like a rock.

The equities markets are turning north for the close. Let's see how that compares with the crypto exchanges over the next 2-3 hours. Still not much data to work with, but it's an interesting avenue of inquiry.
@_date: 2018-02-07 03:49:27
Volume over the last 18 hours has actually been pretty good while the price was recovering (on GDAX). Take a look. The volume seems to be thinning over the last 2 hours as the price softens. Read that how you like.
@_date: 2018-02-02 14:38:44
Total money invested / number of BTC on hand = average cost per BTC. Buy, sell, do whatever. At any given point when you are trading you do the math. The theory is that you cannot predict the market, and if you spread out your transactions over a long period you are more likely to avoid accidentally buying all your BTC at an atypical high.
@_date: 2018-02-08 05:47:46
Absolutely right. The specific levers that the Federal Reserve has are money supply (creation/destruction of notes and creation of debt) and interest rates on short and long-term borrowing by banks. It can add more liquidity and take it away at will, to adjust for demand and thereby control the rate of inflation. The US government also has the ability to control demand directly by adjusting tax rates and fees that are only payable in US dollars, and by issuing payments to personnel and suppliers in USD. While the government cannot arbitrarily make the value of a USD whatever they want, they can guide it pretty significantly and thereby guarantee relatively stable levels of purchasing power and volatility. This is what makes it a more desirable currency for some purposes than BTC. I don't think this is what most folks mean when they say "backed by the US government", but these are real benefits. They come with a lot of baggage, too, of course.

For the next few days we're going to be watching closely for signs of correlation. We regard correlation as net negative, in the sense that it will show us that the BTC exchange price is heavily weighted by sentiment toward BTC as an investible asset. We regard the 'core' value of BTC to be its utility as a means of payment and store of value. We would like to see a loose relationship with the equities markets, since those are dominated by investors (rather than folks transacting or storing value).
On the bright side, however, a clear correlation would help us trade more effectively in the near term.
@_date: 2018-02-07 19:33:05
Bitcoin is (1) a trade good, (2) a store of value and (3) investment-class asset. 
On (1): It is a trade good because it's technically not a currency, but it is an asset with a liquid market. The fiat exchange rate for it isn't relevant for this use case because you typically trade your other valuable currencies/assets for BTC, then give the BTC to the other party in exchange for whatever it is you want from them that is denominated in BTC. You buy as much as you need and as long as the value doesn't change too much during the transaction you can get the value to the other party without losing any in the process. The fiat exchange value of a BTC doesn't really matter at all, in this case, since BTC are divisible. 1-2% daily volatility in exchange value is probably not an issue, since an end-to-end transaction typically takes 3 hours (assuming the fee on all three sub-transactions - you buy the BTC, you transfer the BTC, other party sells BTC - is high enough to get them each in the next block).
On (2): A store of value is not an investment, because the primary goal of storing value is not losing any value while it's stored - there is no consideration for 'increasing' value at all, in this case. Fiat currencies are poor stores of value because they are deliberately devalued by the state banks that control demand and supply. State banks do this to prevent people from using the money supply to store value. For most people, this 'store of value' use would be analogous to a savings account with a bank account (i.e. one that that pays just enough interest to offset inflation). People seem use BTC this way when traditional banking is not available or is unreliable/untrustworthy. Zimbabwe and Venezuela come to mind. For this case, daily volatility is less of an issue, but long term volatility (months or years) is the concern: exchange value can increase, but users must have a high degree of trust that it will not decrease.
On (3): An investment assumes growth in value. The finite supply of BTC forces the exchange value of a BTC to increase as there is more demand for BTC. The 'core' demand for BTC comes from (1) and (2). The growth in the exchange value of BTC makes it an investment. As the inflow of capital slows near the top of the adoption s-curve, the rate of increase in value will slow. As growth slows and the BTC user base expands the law of large numbers will drive a drop in volatility until the speculative component of the overall market capitalization of BTC becomes a reflection on broad-based economic growth. BTC may never stop growing in value, because the world continues to create more wealth than it expends on an annualized basis and the 'left-over' wealth that we generate needs to be stored somewhere. That excess wealth may go into many types of value stores, but if BTC is sufficiently trustworthy and liquid it will pick up its fair share simply because of its privacy and convenience.
The BTC adoption s-curve is a 20 year curve (in our opinion) and we are not quite 1/2 way there. We expect sharp growth and continued high volatility (and more crashes, followed by fresh all-time highs) for the next 24-36 months.

Look at the top of the price chart where it says: 
"3:00 AM - 4:00 AM → O:6,440.00 H:6,490.00 L:6,178.50 C:6,467.02 V:90"
THe "V" is Volume in BTC transacted (Open/High/Low/Close/Volume).
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:25:48
If BTC were valued purely on the capital that is in the process of being transacted plus the value that is being stored there by folks who don't have a stock broker, savings account or anywhere else similarly liquid to put their wealth then the total cap would probably be ~$90B (a bit more than $6k/BTC). Add a little HODL speculation on top of that and I end up with a stable price in the range of $7-8k/BTC. That seems to match the technical analysis, as well as my rule-of-thumb that humans always use a simple heuristic and (emotionally) respond to changes that cross boundaries in 1/3 increments. There is actually a lot of experimental data which shows that people tend to think of a 1/3 change as a "meaningful" change and a 2/3 change as a "major" change. I believe that the mainstream users who pumped up the price in the fall are expecting a "major" change downward and won't be satisfied it's hit bottom until they see it. This is not investing advice, and you need to do your own research and make up your mind, obviously. That said, we are waiting for some sharp swings int eh $6.5-7k range and a bounce up to $8-8.5k before it drifts a bot lower and then goes horizontal for a few weeks with low volatility and relatively low volume.
NOTE: This is just a guess. Everybody has to have a hypothesis ;-)

I got an email from them too:
"Last year, we launched the ability for Coinbase customers to instantly buy digital currency with their bank account. This was the result of customer feedback that the time between purchasing and receiving digital currency was too long.
In order to enable instant buys:
1. Visit your accounts page on Coinbase
2. Remove the following bank as a payment method:  [name of my bank]
3. Re-link it by selecting your bank and logging in via the secure prompt
Linking a bank only takes a couple minutes. If successful, your purchases will have an instant delivery time. 
In some rare cases, your bank’s security settings may prevent us from offering instant buys. If this happens, you will notice your orders delivered at non-instant delivery dates. If you run into any trouble, you can learn more about connecting a bank account on our support page.
Thank you for being a customer.

@_date: 2018-02-07 20:33:18
We agree. We’re bullish on this right now because we think the BTC network effect and technical roadmap make it the most likely winner for the long term. We don’t believe that any of the alts have a sufficiently clear and sustainable technical advantage to overcome their smaller networks/ecosystems. Most of them are solutions looking for a problem. In this case, only time will tell. We do want to see BTC regain a larger share of the crypto market cap as the speculation-fueled alts slowly fade to 0.
@_date: 2018-02-07 22:39:33

Hypothesis: BTC and the crypto markets are starting to align with the equities markets. We believe that this is because investors are still struggling to figure out how to handle this asset class and are defaulting to the same strategies they use for equities trading. We are paying close attention to the performance of the equities markets during each day (follow-the-sun) and are factoring those markets into our micro-trend analysis (dailies). For example, look at the Asian equities markets today and compare with the BTC trend at the moment.

Yes. Use renewables to generate the electricity, use the heat byproduct instead of using energy to directly create heat. Use the revenue from Bitcoin mining to generate revenue from off-peak (or otherwise wasted) power to increase ROI from the investment in generating renewable power. This is much more efficient than current infrastructure.

The current exchange value trend for BTC on GDAX seems to be mirroring the equities markets. At 12:00 EST the equities markets started to turn south, and over the next 45 minutes so did BTC. I believe that the synchronous action in both crypto and equities markets over the last few days is continuing. I don't have a lot of data to work from, but I think overall investor sentiment may be having an unusual influence on the BTC exchange value, rather than a specific concern re Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-02-07 22:37:41
We did an analysis for one of our clients on the hypothesis that the BTC market cap is a combination of (1) Currency substitution: users buying BTC for the purpose of executing transactions, (2) Value storage: folks buying BTC and holding them (i.e. in lieu of a savings account, no expectation of *increase* in value) and (3) Speculation: buying BTC as an investment which *will appreciate in value*. We looked at trading volumes on exchanges, the distribution of trades at different sizes, survey data from users (self-reported) and some sane but otherwise unscientific postulation about the implication of BTC/USD trading history on Bitstamp and GDAX compared with a few other currencies (ZWL, RMB, KRW, VEF). 
Our estimate is approximately ~$100B for the currency and savings core users with an added amount for long-term HODLers (speculators that will not sell, regardless of performance). This is imprecise, because it's really, really hard to get data about usage of a system that is designed to be highly distributed and private. That said, our client was comfortable with our proposal that there is a firm floor of $6.5-7k USD/BTC. We know that panic selling could drive the price per BTC down for brief periods, as could periods of network congestion that drive fees up too high. In general, we don't see any scenario that would result in a sustained exchange value below the $6.5-7k range. 
As always, you need to come to your own conclusions and I can't really offer you any advice about what to expect. I can't give you any more details on our study either, given that we don't own the rights to the work we did. I suggest you mull it over and think about how you might be able to get data to help you size each of the three buckets I mentioned so you can come to your own number. Don't trade based on my numbers - those are just an example from one study.

I'm not convinced that Bitcoin Cash is even a relevant topic of discussion anymore. The BCH network is on the verge of implosion. BCH value has not recovered and is close to 0.1 BTC, which means that it has lower mining profitability than BTC. It also has fewer transactions than BTC, fewer developers and a smaller ecosystem of users. It hasn't gained ground in any appreciable way since it was launched. Roger and team have worked hard to fill the gaps with marketing and evangelism, but the bottom line is that the BCH blockchain is not a great payment system and is inferior to BTC as a store of value. We can probably stop caring about it and spend our energy on other things, at this point.
@_date: 2018-07-24 01:03:44
There is no problem. You have to get additional BTC to cover your interest. The value of all debts can exceed the money supply. That is normal today, and has nothing to do with fiat vs. crypto debates. Further, debt can be repaid in non-crypto assets valued in BTC, like bonds, stocks, real estate and so forth. BTC as an asset and BTC as a way of denominating value of other assets are not the same thing.

Electricity  can effectively be free. The cheapest way to generate *new* electricity is now renewable energy (excluding carbon subsidies). PV solar and wind have very low costs. It is possible to use Bitcoin mining to reduce volatility in energy prices and improve the business case for building out renewable energy generation by eliminating revenue variability: BTC mining can consume off-peak energy produced and provide a reliable way to fully utilize the renewable energy produced for maximum ROI. 
To your point, the total energy consumed may well be more, but it is consumed in a way that allows it to make use of excess energy that would otherwise have no value (the alternative would be storing it somehow, which is expensive, rather than revenue-generating). 
If you were to count the many tens of thousands of existing servers running software that is obsoleted by Bitcoin, along with the economic costs of the thousands of people who are looking after all of that heterogeneous legacy infrastructure, you might find that the environmental impact (carbon production, land use, workforce productivity per unit of economic capacity consumed) would be less if Bitcoin were used as a substitute. I have read a few studies along these lines but none that (in our view) avoided arbitrarily treating some important costs as external to the model(s).

["A Satoshi is the smallest fraction of a Bitcoin that can currently be sent: 0.00000001 BTC, that is, a hundredth of a millionth BTC. In the future, however, the protocol may be updated to allow further subdivisions, should they be needed."](
There are currently about 14 million Bitcoin in circulation (3-4 million have been lost forever and the rest of the 21 million have yet to be mined). 1,400,000,000,000,000 Satoshi's (14,000,000 x 100,000,000) is enough for 7 billion people to each own 200,000.
In 2015 [Credit Suisse published a report]( that calculated the total of all wealth in the world to be valued at approximately $250,000,000,000,000 (250 trillion USD). If all the wealth in the world (as of 2015) were converted to BTC, each Satoshi would've had a value approximately equal to $0.18.
In 2017, [MarketWatch published an article]( that estimated the total USD value of all gold and currency in circulation to be $7.6 trillion and $7.7 trillion (respectively), for a total of $15.3 trillion. If all of the currency and gold in the world were replaced with Bitcoin, a Satoshi would have a value roughly equal to $.01.
