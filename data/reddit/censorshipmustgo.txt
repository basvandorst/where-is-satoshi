At one point rare tulip bulbs were worth the equivalent of a small fortune, but that didn't mean their price ever recovered to those values once the speculative bubble of the Dutch tulip craze burst.

I think both you and need to actually read the article you are linking.
My point is that past performance is no guarantee of future results. I point to the tulip craze as one example of an asset bubble where the values crashed and they never again rose to the highs they had achieved.
From the article:


If you still want to ignore the historical precedent of the price of rare tulip bulbs never attaining the heights they had reached during the tulip bubble, look at the scores of other examples from history.
One such example... the dotcom bubble of the late 90's. At that time, many dotcom stocks like pets.com were valued way beyond what their earnings would support. People kept pumping money into dotcom stocks because "this time it's different!"
When it all crashed and burned, stocks like pets.com never came close to rising to the values they once commanded. True, there were some companies like Amazon that emerged and represented real value, but the vast majority of dotcom stocks were totally speculative and just because they had reached a certain price in the past was NO GUARANTEE that they would ever again reach that price point.
I am merely pointing out the fallacy in the belief that bitcoin (or ANY asset for that matter) will reach a certain nominal value based on prior performance. Look again at the post I responded to. The poster was saying bitcoin will go back up in value because it was once a higher value. There is no basis for this conclusion except faith and an erroneous belief that past performance guarantees future results.
