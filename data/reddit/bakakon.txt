I went to the import private key tab page looking for the 'sweep' function or anything related but could not find one. Thanks you for responding.

Wow.. theres always a first time for everything. First time getting a tip by a complete stranger in the internet.
Now with this amount i could buy all the other remaining materials for this project (relays, solenoid valves etc)
This is not for myself actually, this is for a small community of about five families, my neighbors, sharing a vegetable garden and im building them an automated watering system. I also introduced them to aquaponics system because water in this area is scarce. Its been a yr since I planned on doing this with a low cost micro board, ... and with the bitcoin rising and the us thanksgiving sales going on... and this.
This tip will come a long way my friend and on thier behalf I could not thank you enough. I will publish the updates of the garden here soon.

Yes. Amazon says it could ship to the philippines but
from what i read from the other forums, the shipping hassles and the cost would tell you that its not worth the value. It is just so hard to find these items around here. I don't know why the people making these low power, low cost, educational devices (raspberry, arduino etc) made it so hard for third world country people to own them when we mostly need them.
I found some bitcoin electronic shops in Australia selling the arduino but the shipping itself is more expensive than the microcontroller board. (I was expecting the shipping to be cheaper, since it is closer geographicaly to the. phils). This project (community garden automation) will take a backseat for now. Maybe around January, hoping the bitcoin value will continue to rise.
Thanks.
