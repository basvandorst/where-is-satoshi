Basicly it would go something like this: when I (or all the people) send a Bitcoin transaction I would reinforce my consensus in the bockchain, by laying trust in the miners and paying them a (small) fee of honor.
Edit: you only need one transaction to quit.

Maybe every pool can make its own donation address and people just have to tip the smallest pool. Off course this will not work. Is there no automatic way of doing this? Maybe set a limit on maximum earnings/pool?

If Amazone will do a run-up by accepting bitcoin, Overstock will lose ground in the real world again. Ok, but Overstock will own lots of bitcoin by than, every day more in fact. Those bitcoin will rise in value when a player like Amazone starts accepting bitcoin, making Overstock even richer.... It's a free ride for Overstock :)

Indeed, if the corporate agenda is to kill Bitcoin then there have been plenty of stories to paint the walls dark black (dramatic pricedrop, Bitstamp hack in particular). The lack of those exuberant stories tells us something. I feel more good news coming up.

20mb/block-size seems a reasonable suggestion by Gavin. Maybe even sufficient for a very long long time when we take this chance (we can not keep upping the block-size-limit just like that) to create, test and implement robust payment channels.
Edit: with 'just like that' I mainly meant that its hard to get to consensus. In the future it might be even more difficult to get consensus.

Thanks for posting this, I was not yet familiar with Vinay Gupta. I have already viewed [another lecture]( from him, great guy. He is right in saying the Bitcoin community needs more time to learn about the complex world, it just takes time to get it with all its implications. Just like the first time I learned about Bitcoin took it a while to understand it. 
Just some side info here about therms like [classical libertarianism, libertarian socialist, state socialist and state capitalist]( [Anarchism here]( a therm people around here in Europe use for utter chaos.

The reason Bitcoin has worked until now is because its the most beneficial to cooperate honestly. Miners have to understand this principle for not to lose there investments. Around the time this video was taken Ghash.io had a big  percentage of the mining hashrate, and look at the [mining hashrate distribution]( now. Not perfect maybe, but far from dangerous. Miners have learned to follow the unwritten rule to keep the mining hashrate distributed, even in pools. Bitcion is deflationary (disinflationary?), a genius choice from Satoshi, this should keep the incentive to search for solutions that keeps it most beneficial to act honestly, with written rules in the Bitcoin software or without.
@_date: 2015-08-23 19:11:51
There is still a lot to learn how everything needs to be implicated. My feeling is such that Bitcoin's nature is that its the miners who form the [benevolent dictator for life]( They need to make the choices that are best for all of us.  They need to demonstrate logically why they are right. If we figure out they are not right we have a problem. The reason Bitcoin has worked until now is because its the most beneficial to act honestly, with written rules in the Bitcoin software or without (like the hashrate distribution).
@_date: 2015-08-26 20:26:44
I think going to 2MB blocksize is a good choice to see how mining further develops. It also gives Bitcoin time to develop alternative solutions like sidechains or The Lightning Network. Are there some numbers around about what the impact these layers could have on transaction volume? That would be very helpful to compare the different proposals.
@_date: 2015-08-23 14:15:29


I agree, and that makes it ever so important for the miners to make the right decisions. Bitcoin's nature should be auto-balancing, otherwise it just wouldn't work. If the miners go selfish Bitcoin is finished.
Edit: Also [this]( Socrates stated that the opinion of the majority is not always right.
The miners are the [benevolent dictator for life]( and need to demonstrate logically why they are right. If we figure out they are not right we have a problem.
Edit2: do you have any suggestions maybe?
@_date: 2015-08-15 22:21:23


I'm running trough this same question. I think we can trust them because all is open source and because anyone can just set something like this up any day. But here Gavin and Hearn do ask the hard question (with lots of work behind it) and we have to answer if they are philosophical right. One open question for me is, can I vote as a node without mining? I also hope the other core developers can work on unscratched afterwards when 75% consensus is reached, we can lose them...

Well, buying for speculation is one thing, but you can be sure I'm going to use it as well when Ebay (or equivalent) will support it better. Or 2nd hand websites, when people will accept it.

Option C) It looks highly unlikely, but why not. There have been more of these revolutionary ideas in the past, and with very smart people behind it like now I think there is a chance.

It will grow more and more I think. Once it will be easer and more common to spend Bitcoins, and that is every day a little bit, people get more used to it and the price will surely increase. Plus, I can see nothing big in the way for Bitcoin to slow it down, never mind stopping it.
