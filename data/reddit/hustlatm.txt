this is like asking a gold miner what they think about fiat. so fucking dumb CNBC. Great reporting. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 02:41:38
On your dashboard under tools there's a reports tab that you can use to run a report that shows your cost basis which is what you'd use to determine your capital gains. Keep in mind that you should only account for sells. If you just moved your coins to an offline wallet, it might account for that in the overall cost basis so you'd need to go through it and remove those IF you still have the coins in that other wallet

I understand they're secure but if the price is dripping fast, how quickly would you be able to get those coins back on an exchange to sell?

OMG same. I wish I saved all the Charlie from It's Always Sunny memes. Can anyone help!??
@_date: 2017-03-18 02:21:43
I mean. I do understand why they'd wanna control it. They understand the market cap to gain and love beating the US to any kind of economical punch. They should control BU and we can make it an altcoin leaving BTC untarnished.
@_date: 2017-03-31 01:30:39
Fair assessment
@_date: 2017-03-18 01:33:30
Wow. Didn't know that. It'd be awesome if that rule only applied to the majority of BU miners located in China.
@_date: 2017-03-18 01:30:02
Great point. I figured they made that statement because of this week's turn of events for BU to capitalize on it. I thought that would have led to more stability / relaxation from the community knowing that there is a plan in place should something occur.
@_date: 2017-03-10 21:49:54
dude, they suck sometimes. I recommended two friends who had each deposited $100 and i never got my $10 =[[. I even hella micro managed their subscription so i would get the referral bonus. had to send them an email and they've only responded twice with the same question asking if the issue was resolved. WTF!?
@_date: 2017-03-11 05:27:36
Agreed! I'm plenty surprised and also kinda laughing at the people who were selling when they dropped below 1000. Although coinbase shit the bed today, they saved me some $$.

My assumption is that it used to be incredibly rare for tech startups to get such a high valuation due to the difficulty in tracking ROI i.e. Instagram,  snapchat, etc. So when they did, it was like seeing a unicorn.

I'm a US citizen and I trade on the NYSE so I will always pay my taxes just to cover my capital investments. I've heard too many times about the IRS coming after you years later with a huge fine that would kill all my gains 
@_date: 2017-08-18 19:15:43
you will only have to pay a capital gains tax if you sold the BCH you aquired during the fork. if sold prior to one year of acquiring it you face a 15-20% tax, if sold after a year of aquiring it (08/2018) you will only pay a 10% tax. 
@_date: 2017-08-01 04:23:18
Question, will we get taxed by IRS as capital gains when we moved our coins? I heard they still get taxed even if you move them. I'm scared of the tax man. 
@_date: 2017-08-18 19:20:53
I wasn't aware that bch has been around that long? Since the value was set on 8/1, I believe that is the acquire date for everyone. Unless I'm wrong here?

@_date: 2017-11-08 17:51:23
wait. i wanna see! is there a website you use to track the futures from CME? I think those are going to be the most important driver because of the ability to add big players into the mix. thanks in advance

I too use Coinbase and they're total deushbags. I will say that their UI is infinitely more user friendly and safer than others, though. With that said - I still reported them to the Better Business Bureau for false advertising

Although I completely agree with you on that aspect, I believe that all it takes is 1 head of department to influence a whole sector. Never know! Maybe they do support it.

What is the best wallet to use to store? Is mycelium good? I've heard that Coinbase will cancel your account for transferring large sums to an offline wallet

That's until they develop a system where more can be mined I.E. A duplicate chain of the same amount that starts at the value where the last left off opening up a whole new segment

@_date: 2017-07-28 00:10:28
it's going to be a hard choice to make. all of the FUD going around isn't making the decision easier for anyone. my thoughts are that both will be diluted facing a certain drop on both chains meaning it'll be tough for a while. since the amount isn't substantial, i'd say you should sell the coins for the cash and repurchase post fork on the BTC chain which will most certainly be facing a temporary drop. once it goes back up, you could be looking at a profit. 
@_date: 2017-07-28 01:33:51
Ohhhh, ok thanks. Was too scared to try it but for some reason it's still on my CB account
@_date: 2017-07-28 00:38:36
Coinbase accepts paypal as a payment method BUT beware because although Coinbase accepts them, Paypal is known to close accounts that contribute to Bitcoin wallets/exchanges. It claims that they're unsafe so they can't continue to support your account which is total bs.
