Day trading is a good way.

What service are you using? Never paid more than 5.

You laughed out loud out loud?

I have been following the words of bitcoin Jesus and trying to spread the message to the infidels. I'll tell my cpa to look into this.

Stop 
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:22:46
I'm gonna buy more as soon as I can, hopefully a thousand every month starting January. So I say hodl. I seriously believe in the technology.

It was created in every wallet in an equal balance to what bitcoin was in there at the time. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:22:16
Really? Fastest acceleration of a production car, safest crash tests, it broke the machine, self driving... 
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:59:27
No it's not. Made 3 transactions over the last month and none over 5
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:31:05
I did a few weeks ago. I just think of it as diversification. Who knows, it may be worth 1k some day. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:37:15
And diamond! Wooooo! S/

Is that an atom? That would be a cool btc car. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:20:18
Isn't that just the ath? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:53:37
A few people made a shit ton of money. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 18:22:28
No, this decision was good, the reasoning is horrible. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:35:54
LOL! What a surprise. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:52:33
Lol. I like your attitude. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:06:33
Make it a rule only every 5k or something. It's almost every day now! 
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:57:23
What service are you using? Never paid more than 5.
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:32:14
Really? It shares at least some qualities if btc. It is fast too. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:50:26
Well, more lambos for us. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:03:44
Lol. Looser! Guess you didn't invest and you're upset? 
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:10:56
That's why I said basically. I understand how it works, well relatively. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:25:08
Lol well not thousands for me. I wish. Thousands of percent though, so that's amazing. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:42:12
No actually. It's been a couple of weeks and mostly I used whatevers on the mycilum app. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:56:22
Who is paying these fees? I've moved thousands of dollars worth many times and the most I've paid is $4.50 still too much but not 20.who are these fucking liars, do you work at steam? 
@_date: 2018-05-06 16:04:36
So damn funny to see them turn a 180.
@_date: 2017-02-22 05:48:59
Don't see why you sold at all. It's just going to go up. Think long term 
@_date: 2017-03-05 17:39:55
Not giving shit, but it really does suck. It made me think of the Facebook episode of South Park when Kip Drorty has only one friend and Kyle added him. I almost want to send you some. I feel bad for people with shit jobs and they get paid shit too. The worst jobs get paired with the worst pay, cool! 
@_date: 2017-03-05 16:45:59
Some people only have $8 in btc? How sad. 
@_date: 2017-03-11 00:16:17
Only used them for purchases and then transfer
@_date: 2017-03-18 21:38:23
I can't help but feel this is a bunch of people regulating something they have nothing to do with. Isn't that the equivalent of "taxation without representation"? I can't wait to see this fail. 
@_date: 2017-03-18 21:39:47
If done correctly it can be. 
@_date: 2017-03-17 14:12:07
I've only been in like 6 months and I already know. It's got ups and downs, buy look at the all time charts, it's a constant gain. Some major spikes and dips initially, but it's all good. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 01:30:57
It's still super low. Give it time. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 01:29:53
Lol yah right. I just sold some because I needed to make a large purchase and now I'm checking even more now get to see what would have happened if I could have waited. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:36:51
The nice thing is it's always the right time to buy, it's gonna keep going up. 
@_date: 2017-10-14 16:38:24
I'm mid 30s and it's already sad in my generation. It may be a side effect of them not being able to logically work through ideas though. 
@_date: 2017-10-21 00:33:03
This is how I think now. When I say I want more people say "but it's $xxx! That's so expensive!" (when I first bought) and "it's $xxxx! That's so expensive!" (now) I just tell them I'll still buy when it's $10000 and $100000. 10k may be way sooner than I ever imagined. 
@_date: 2017-10-14 15:45:52
Also, we should read things that make us uncomfortable. 
@_date: 2017-10-14 19:23:53
I can sympathize, I'm crying in the small bus I bought. 
@_date: 2017-10-15 11:00:34
Best advice is zoom out! 
@_date: 2017-10-21 00:35:42
This is why you put your debt in $! 
@_date: 2017-10-08 01:44:43
I don't think they know that the chart scales on recent activities yet. This is just called a normal day.  When it gets to 400 change in a day then post the memes.  
@_date: 2017-05-25 14:59:47
At one point there always a 24hr period with 370 in gains. 
@_date: 2017-06-06 05:08:12
Holy fuck this is nuts! 
@_date: 2017-06-06 05:12:48
I think it's really just for convenience. Idk if there's a market, but if there are people who want to pay for someone to buy them stuff, what's the problem? I wouldn't, but I know people who pay for things 10 times easier.
