yeah, definitely primedice. From my understanding, runs an online BTC casino. They are incredibly nice and fair... one guy won 2,000 BTC last weekend. They were legitimate and paid out.
I totally agree about the BTC network growing. Changetip is doing SUCH a good thing for the Bitcoin community by bringing attention to it AGAIN. I'm ready for BTC to come back on the media if changetip gets any bigger.

Wow, you are awesome... that's the biggest tip I've seen so far! (Along with the other 50000 bit tips)

Tipping is awesome regardless. I'm still waiting for someone to get like a $100 tip and FREAK THE FUCK OUT xD

dude changetip is actually so awesome, it's a new payment system for helping each other out :) It makes the Internet a friendlier place. I'm waiting for twitch to accept streamtip

Yeah, I agree. However, I assume diapolis is a smart guy and knew what he was getting into when he started tipping everyone. He probably knew he would be tipping some dupe accounts, and accepted it. I'm not taking the side of the scammers (their actions are morally wrong); however, I assume diapolis knows that it would have happen inevitably, and the choice he made was to tip everyone. 
Again, I am not supporting the scammers. It was money and he decided what he wanted to do with it.

Even though I think Bitcoin is an awesome idea, I think this is an utter shitpost. First of all, this does not represent the volatility of USD; this just shows how purchasing power of a single dollar has gone down. However, it does not have the graph that is necessary to see if the dollar is suffering from inflation (which is still not volatility) or another factoring causing it to weaken: how much people are earning from 1913-2013.
Second, the bitcoin IS volatile. It's gone from being $1250 to $175 usd within a year and couple of months, and back to $250-300 again. Even though I'm a supporter, this is a con of the currency.
TL;DR: this is a shitpost, move on.
