[This site]( says they even will want a cut if you use it as currency. 
If you just hold forever and don't spend it because the IRS wants a cut, what's the point?
@_date: 2019-07-27 03:49:02
Long term gains (investments &gt; 1 year old) aren't that bad, being marginal up to 20%. Short term investments, though, are taxed just like any other income.
That's one reason I just HODL.
@_date: 2019-07-27 01:36:08
Does the IRS do this for every type of currency? If I head across the border to Canada, convert to CAD, then buy something there at an overall better price, am I supposed to pay some taxes on the discount?
And if someone was buying BTC and using it to make purchases regularly over time with hundreds or even thousands of transactions, there's no way they can go back and track every transaction and make a determination on each one whether they profited overall or not. 
Maybe I'm misunderstanding the intent of the IRS, but it almost sounds easier from a tax standpoint to cash out eventually and just pay taxes on one long term capital gain instead of using Bitcoin as a currency.
@_date: 2014-03-27 04:54:39
The maximum loss of capital gain is $3000 per year on taxes. Example: you buy $90,000 in bitcoin and later sell it for $60,000. You lost $30,000 overall and claim that loss on your taxes. You can take $3000 off your taxable income each year for ten years.

With all these issues that come up with both online and offline wallets, it makes me wonder just what the best solution is for storing your btc.
@_date: 2014-02-14 16:23:32
Thanks. My thought was to treat it as a long term investment for now. If the volatility ever stabilizes and bitcoin becomes accepted in many establishments, I'll start spending it.
@_date: 2014-02-14 16:24:27
Well it's minimum is zero in this case. Maximum? To the MOON.
@_date: 2014-02-14 15:42:10
@_date: 2014-02-14 20:17:43
True, but isn't any non-guaranteed positive yield investment a speculation? He housing market is a good example of what used to be a solid investment turned sour.
I'm just putting a little into it at a time just in case it does take off. I won't get rich unless it increases a thousand fold, and those days are likely over. But maybe I'll return a bit of positive ROI.
As for spending it, I simply mean that if lots of places start accepting BC, I'll at least have some to spend.

I've put in a little money every paycheck since just before the huge run up. So far, only my first purchase has increased in value.

Care to share details of how to effectively day trade bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-06-17 17:20:28
Depends on what you want. Could be a final value you're shooting for, such as getting out of debt or retirement. Could be you think Bitcoin will become a viable alternative to fiat, so you HODL forever and start buying with Bitcoin someday.

How are they going to know if you spend your bitcoin to buy something?
@_date: 2019-06-01 05:20:05
I think he's saying applying a quadratic curve fit to bitcoin doesn't mean anything.
I just used a 3rd order polynomial and it shoots negative over time.
@_date: 2019-06-17 17:18:32
Explain the graph, please.
In the US at least, it's better from a tax percentage to hold beyond a year. Any short term trades (less than 1 year) get charged tax at your full taxable income. Long term trades get taxed at a lower percentage. Have you factored that into earnings calculations?
Just because a strategy performs well in a back test doesn't mean it will do well in the future.

If the IRS treats this like any other investment, losses greater than $3k will be split up in $3k yearly deductions on your taxes.

Both stories are relevant to the situation.

An amateur here when it comes to these types of investments. VTSAX looks like a nice steady yearly ROI over the years. VBTLX, however, is fairly flat. Looking at the descriptions online, though, it looks like they pay out dividends regularly. I presume that's why anyone puts money in it, right?
@_date: 2018-07-13 19:08:07
Thanks, man! I just checked my spreadsheet and was getting the error.
Has Google officially dropped support for this or is it just temporarily disabled for some reason?
@_date: 2019-09-26 16:35:58
Exactly. Lump sum is nice and all, but the majority of people can't do that. Hindsight says I should have remortgaged my house in 2012 and thrown all that into bitcoin, but it wasn't feasible and would've been a huge risk to take at the time.
@_date: 2019-09-26 16:31:13
Why are you here if you're against crypto?
@_date: 2013-12-07 14:48:31
If you accept bitcoin, that's one more business to add to the list, increasing the value of my bitcoin. ;) The volatility may make you want to stay away for now. How much of a risk are you willing to take?

I think he's saying it's reset every 2016 blocks. So if suddenly most miners went away, then it is possible that the mining system could get stuck in the middle of a block and never be solved.
Edit: I do not know if this is correct, but this is how I read what was written.

Serious question here. If you sell $10k worth of stuff in a yard sale, but you originally paid $20k for all the stuff, that's technically a loss. Would the IRS still want money off the sales?
@_date: 2013-11-20 23:52:16
It's the Fiat 500, so you buy 500 coins each time. Duh!

@_date: 2013-11-14 04:02:25
Thanks, but I wasn't asking about taking a loss off my taxes. I was asking if the irs would want to tax the $10k in sales, but I was able to answer my own question later with a google search.
@_date: 2013-11-20 23:54:17
To mine bitcoin when it was easier to do so, of course.
@_date: 2013-11-13 23:27:07
MSRP is one thing, but your initial expenses should count. If you spent $8k and sold $10k worth of stuff, your expenses should only be $2k.
In the case of bitcoin, if you spend $10k on bitcoin and sell it for $25k, you should only be taxed on the $15k profit.
I'm no accountant so perhaps I'm talking out my ass, but this is how I've been taxed on earnings before.
@_date: 2013-12-16 16:36:24
Fireproof safe.
@_date: 2013-12-18 16:53:27
If you're in it for the long term, you just have to ignore drops like this and be patient.
@_date: 2013-11-29 04:36:48
But there's only about $14 billion worth of bitcoin out there right now, vs trillions upon trillions of dolla dolla bills.

I don't think I replied to your post.
@_date: 2013-11-25 04:15:15
If you cash any out, make sure you cover yourself on taxes if you spend it. Since the majority of any of your withdrawal will be considered capital gains, you'll owe taxes on it.

If you can predict the future, this strategy is perfect.
@_date: 2013-11-14 02:00:45
Back to my original example, the irs wouldn't let you write it off unless it was for a business. Otherwise, you should be able to claim that the sales are not taxable since it's a loss. I've bought games, played them, and sold them for a loss later. I don't expect the irs to let me write off the loss of my hobby, nor do I expect them to want any money off of me reselling my game.
Same goes for a yard sale. If I sell an item that I originally bought at a higher price, I do not expect to have to pay taxes on the sale.
Edit: this site has a good write up.
