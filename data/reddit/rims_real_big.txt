Want to ensure I never loan you any money again? Pay me back in bitcoins. 
@_date: 2018-08-02 16:47:45
And then maybe they could loan out fiat, maybe like 10x the amount of Bitcoin they have in reserves.

\&gt;FDIC insurance is a way of capping the damages from a potential flaw which simply doesn't apply to bitcoin
Bitcoin has its own flaws. If there is a run on bitcoin, mass selloff you lose money similar to a run on the bank. If you Bitcoin is hacked, you also have no protection.

Make it illegal to accept Bitcoin as payment. Make it illegal for Banks to facilitate the transfer of fiat to Bitcoin. 90 day grace period to cash out any Bitcoin owned after which time any Bitcoin is forfeited.

Tether will keep it around 6k. It's way too profitable to let it slide too far. Can't have a mass selloff. 
@_date: 2018-08-09 15:33:22
I see the exchanges finally saw it was profitable to liquidate the shorts. 
@_date: 2018-08-14 11:46:41
You heard it here folks. It is now physically impossible for Bitcoin to drop below 6k. 
@_date: 2018-08-15 14:10:11

I think these fundamental questions need to be answered. You mentioned a bunch of antiquated technologies that were replaced. The thing is the replacements had a clear advantage, they made life easier. Bitcoin makes life harder when it comes to everyday purchases. How do you think Apple would fare if they released an ios that was harder to use and added steps to every process?

I owned an iPhone the first day they were released. They were like magic. The first full browser on a smart phone. They completely blew the competition out of the water. There is a reason iPhone is the most dominant phone now and blackberry is all but defunct. Your comment about not needing one unless you were and enthusiast or needed it for work is off base as well. One of the early criticisms of the iPhone was that it wasn't business friendly and many enterprises held on to their blackberries for the time being.
Most of your solutions are from a perspective of the company and come with their own downsides such as AML and KYC compliance and will create additional complications with capital gains.
As far as your customer incentives scan to pay is already a thing. Most retail purchases in China are made through wechat by scanning a QR or barcode. It could easily be done here as well with less complication using fiat rather than adding unnecessary steps with Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-10-28 02:53:24
Ummm did you not see how high the price spiked after this post? 
@_date: 2018-10-22 15:04:05
Price is certainly important, but I look at it like this... if Bitcoin were a human female, price is her level of physical attractiveness... she's still developing and right now she's learning about the world, developing intellectual and social skills, figuring out her creative talents... some of us can already see how beautiful and smart she is, but that's because we've taken an active interest in getting to know her. As she get's older, more people are going to notice she's attractive and start showing more interest in her, but for now, she's not on their radar. For those watching her grow up, we already know she's going to be a heart breaker, and thankfully there are tons of bright minds making sure she'll have the brains to match.

What is the incentive for the average consumer to use Bitcoin for purchases? People get paid in fiat, they spend their fiat, very simple. Bitcoin adds unnecessary steps to the process. You have to convert your fiat to Bitcoin, you have to navigate the payment process system, you have to track any potential losses or gains every time you buy and sell your Bitcoin for capital gains purposes. It doesn't matter how many coffee shops or taco stands start accepting Bitcoin, making purchases just adds too many complications with no clear upside.

Price is certainly important, but I look at it like this... if Bitcoin were a human female, price is her level of physical attractiveness... she's still developing and right now she's learning about the world, developing intellectual and social skills, figuring out her creative talents... some of us can already see how beautiful and smart she is, but that's because we've taken an active interest in getting to know her. As she get's older, more people are going to notice she's attractive and start showing more interest in her, but for now, she's not on their radar. For those watching her grow up, we already know she's going to be a heart breaker, and thankfully there are tons of bright minds making sure she'll have the brains to match.

The SEC emphasized that the disapproval does not rest on an evaluation of whether bitcoin or blockchain technology has value as an innovation or investment.
**But the agency indicated that its mission is designed to prevent fraudulent or manipulative acts or practices and to protect investors, and that they were concerned about fraud and manipulation of bitcoin, particularly since this is done in a largely unregulated offshore market.
The SEC noted that more than three-fourths of the volume in bitcoin occurs outside the United States, and that 95 percent of the volume occurred on non-U.S. exchanges.**

The rest of the ETFs are going to get rejected as well. The winkle-twins were rejected not due to anything unique to them, but to concerns with Bitcoin itself. Sell while you can. 
Instead of just downvoting please tell me why I'm wrong.

Price is being pumped in anticipation of etf. They want to be able to point to it and say "look at what a great investment this is." This will inevitably end in pain for a lot of people.

How much real estate does Bitcoin own? 
@_date: 2018-07-20 17:54:09
Did you get dropped on your head? There is no need to be patient. We can look at the history of Bitcoin and see how volitale the price has been. This characteristic of Bitcoin shows so sign of changing. No one in here is rooting for price stability, everyone wants it to moon which further solidifies the case against using Bitcoin as a currency and instead to use it as a speculative asset.

It's not buying a retail product. It's a currency exchange. 10% is a ridiculous markup, I'm not sure why you're trying to justify it.  
@_date: 2018-07-21 21:25:35
As history has shown, Bitcoin can't go into recession. The price never goes down.

It's so cute how you guys think governments would just let their currency be usurped by a decentralized system. 
@_date: 2018-07-08 23:50:40
Idk why you guys are talking about resistance. This whole run up has been a series of pumps and nothing more, nothing organic about it. The price rises until the pump stops and then it holds steady until the next pump. 
@_date: 2018-07-22 15:20:15
So 10% is a fairly small price to pay for....? 
@_date: 2018-07-30 14:58:20

People park their money in safe assets during a financial crisis, basic human psychology. Bitcoin will tank during a crisis as people become risk averse.

What ever happened to that guy that always posted the Elliot wave chart? He was mocked everytime he posted it but it looks like he might have been right after all. 
@_date: 2018-12-11 22:38:35
I was curious what everyone thought the valuation of bitcoin should be. 
@_date: 2018-12-13 22:51:18
There are 1800 coins mined a day. Miners need to pay their overhead so they're going to sell coins. As less and less money keeps flowing into Bitcoin this will continue to drive the price downward.

If an ETF were approved I think a whole new group of investors would inevitably get screwed and further sour public sentiment on Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-12-08 06:20:37
The idea of "only investing in Bitcoin what you can afford to lose" is backwards. I'm investing in Bitcoin all the money that I want to SAVE.
@_date: 2018-12-15 03:32:32
Tether is used to manipulate the price of bitcoin. It's all smoke and mirrors.

I think history will repeat itself and we will see a nice bounce above $200 again. 
@_date: 2018-12-10 22:16:06


That's how a lot of people felt at 6.4k

Price is certainly important, but I look at it like this... if Bitcoin were a human female, price is her level of physical attractiveness... she's still developing and right now she's learning about the world, developing intellectual and social skills, figuring out her creative talents... some of us can already see how beautiful and smart she is, but that's because we've taken an active interest in getting to know her. As she get's older, more people are going to notice she's attractive and start showing more interest in her, but for now, she's not on their radar. For those watching her grow up, we already know she's going to be a heart breaker, and thankfully there are tons of bright minds making sure she'll have the brains to match.

Who is to say they didn't take out a loan to provide a snapshot showing every tether was backed. The fact that they won't under go an official audit says it all.
