It’s not a question of you or me selling to them. The question is they can get so much more powerful by using their cash against a drop in the ocean asset like bitcoin and quash it like a little bug ��

Whatever is available in the market they can secretly buy and accumulate, become a large enough whale to splash all over if they intend to. Since its all easily printed, funny monopoly money out of thin air, they can sell it all and make it go down so much that people will pretty much shit their pants wet their beds and run away...

Isn’t that the point so they can make Bitcoin worthless to quash this movement

* **MVP (MasterCard, Visa, PayPal)** are all scared now
* **MVP** better stock up on BTC before its too late for processing their payments in the future

I believe if you channel capacity is 100k on the sending side, the receiving side should also be a match or greater in capacity to send it across.

Why would you say that Bitcoin has no real world usage. Look at the amount of transactions that are happening on the network, even today we are hitting around 300k transactions.
Look at the USD transaction value on bitcoin network its almost 1 Billion USD per day.
If you compare Bitcoin to centralized PayPal, there are multiple reasons Bitcoin is superior platform for payments
Look at the quarterly transactions on PayPal below
In the last quarter of 2018 it made close to $163 Billion in transactions. The same Bitcoin on average in last quarter of 2018 made roughly $100-$120 Billion in transactions which is not bad at all.

If this happens in France... BTC will immediately skyrocket to $6000 in the same day, which is the biggest resistance I see to it now...

How would you make more bitcoins, when its capped at 21Million. Are you talking about shitty prickly forks like BSV and BABC and side chains??

This is a great article from Raman. I've known bitcoin from quite a while, but never took this seriously up until 2017. Wish I dug deeper into Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies sooner...

Its not just venezuela, even first world countries are cheated by banks fractional reserve system.
Wonder what happened to all that gold from Venezuela and Australia hmmmmm...
Are they secretly transferring bullion to various other banks to keep this banking charade going like a big ponzi scheme. Why put Bernie Madoff behind bars when bankers are all colluding in an ever bigger ponzi schema after all. 
Prosecute the bankers and put them all behind bars !!
Short the bankers, Long Bitcoin.

The winning protocol for the internet is TCP/IP. Lots of competing protocols lost the battle. One of them being gopher, there were lots of others. User adoption made all the difference and ultimately survived.
