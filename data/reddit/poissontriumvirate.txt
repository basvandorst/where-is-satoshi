This is idiotic.
First off, the RNGs in modern computers are probably just as good at generating random numbers as dice.
Second off, you still have to type the private key into a computer to A) derive the pubkey and B) derive the bitcoin address, so there's actually almost zero security benefit. And by having to type in the privkey, you run the huge risk of making a typing mistake and generating the wrong address.
Just use battle-tested cold wallet software. My personal recommendation is Armory.

@_date: 2014-06-20 02:38:17


No, it's not. The software is as good as the developer. The language is still bad.
I can probably write good software in x86 assembly. I still choose not to, because there are lots of languages that are better. The software might not be better, but my experience as a coder will be. (And also, better programing languages help prevent mistakes, so the software probably will end up better even if my skill level stays the same.)

That's an obvious fallacy. "Oh god, I hope Bitcoins go down in value! I haven't purchased food in weeks because they're deflationary!"
Sometimes (in fact, most of the time) the utility of purchasing something in the present exceeds the utility of increased capital in the future.
The equivalent (and equally false) argument against inflationary currencies is "the logical thing is to never work if you don't have to, since your wages will be worth less tomorrow." That's false because sometimes (in fact, most of the time) the utility of having (diminished) capital in the future exceeds the utility of not working.

Not necessarily. If money is stolen, you might get insurance or some form of legal recourse. If paypal freezes your money, you're fucked until they decide to un-freeze it. If a business depends on paypal for payment processing, there's no way it can sustain itself for 8 months while paypal dicks around.
Also, I'd rather have money that I control absolutely that might be stolen permanently than money I have very little control over that will probably just be stolen for 8 months.

@_date: 2014-05-20 02:01:43


That is absolutely not the case.
First off, anything that's been through a hash function can no longer be said to be "truly random" without some serious mathematical proofs about the hash function. The only "true" randomness (and even this is arguable) is data that comes straight out of the collapse of a quantum wavefunction that has a 50% chance of going either way (or a biased quantum wavefunction put through a von neumann debiaser).
Second, you *cannot* guarantee that a picture will have the correct quantum properties.
A more accurate statement would be "picture hashes are usually pretty random".

So you use PHP because you can't come up with code on your own?


Facebook is trying to move away from it, and Google does **not** use PHP at all. I just confirmed this with a friend of mine who is a web developer there. 
Besides, you're invoking the *argumentum ad auctoritatem* fallacy. 


You clearly misunderstand or are willfully misrepresenting this analogy. It doesn't make sense to use C++ for building Linux, because the C++ core language relies on OS-level features, so they'd basically be using the C subset of C++ anyway, and C++ is not at all a well-designed language.

Here's what I did. This is *very* safe. Safer than BitAddress or a Piper, IMHO.
1. Buy very cheap laptop. I got a refurb $140 Thinkpad x200.
2. Turn off the wifi chip. Thinkpads have a switch for this.
3. Install Linux (encrypted). Most Linux installers support encryption.
4. Install Armory on the laptop, via a USB drive. Make a new wallet. Then, make backups of the wallet (Armory will help you do this) and make a "watching-only" copy of your wallet.
5. Put the watching-only copy on your internet-connected PC. 
Now you can receive money by generating addresses on the internet-connected PC, but you can only spend money with the offline laptop.
Spending money is easy and secure. You click "offline transaction", enter the details, and then you use a USB drive to sign the transaction with your secure laptop.

Assume 1 lifetime = 90 years. Assume 3% inflation. That's a 14.3x drop in value.
Bitcoin only had a crash like once, in the early days of $0 -&gt; $30 -&gt; $2.

A truly secure setup should not ever have the private keys on a device that's connected to the internet.
Also, electrum uses `python-ecdsa`, which is vulnerable to side-channel timing attacks (iirc), so the device should *definitely* not be on the internet if you're paranoid about an attack, because theoretically any userland process could swipe your keys that way (again, theoretically).

That doesn't make any sense at all. The miners will spend a bit less money than they make (because they're going to want to be profitable). They also spend some money on hardware. The remaining amount is spent on energy.
Therefore, the amount of energy used (in dollars/euros/BTC, not Joules) per time will be a bit less than the block reward per time.
So it's a function of the block reward, the value of BTC, and the cost of energy.

Are you thick? I've told you several times, yes we can, as far as we need to to create correct programs.
You don't need to manually brute-force all possible states. For example:
"Let f(x,y) = x + y where x,y ≥ 0." We can *prove* that all results of f are going to be ≥0. We have just predicted *everything*, for all the infinity possible states going into f. You getting it yet?
Dependently typed languages let us do this for *everything*.

Re C) that's not how markets work. Everyone has a sell point, and BTC is highly divisible anyway, so there will always be enough to go around.

Protip: All "storage coins" are scams. The technology does not exist to create systems that reach distributed consensus on whom is actually storing what.
*All* "storage coins" can be tricked easily. Some you can trick by storing data for "someone else" (the someone else being yourself, and the data you're "storing" being easily computable from a simple PRNG). Some you can trick by storing many copies of the same data on a single hard drive, but presenting yourself as many different devices on the network (so there is actually little/no data redundancy).
The closest possible thing is to have direct, person-to-person online storage systems. There can be no form of "coin" involved where the number of coins you have is directly determined by how much you store. Basically, the best you can possibly do is make a protocol for automatically negotiating payment for someone storing something for you. However, any form of "mining" built in to a storage network could be gamed.

We already do that (sort of). Whenever a major, fork-causing policy change might happen (like the addition of P2SH), the Satoshi devs release a version of the Satoshi client that injects a special "voting" string into any block it mines.
If the Satoshi client detects that the supermajority of the last n mined blocks had the "voting" string inserted, the new policy is adopted.
It's not a perfect system, because to vote against the new policy, you have to either not upgrade your client, or you have to customize the source code, but at the very least it tells you whether or not the change will cause a bad fork.
However, since this is a purely UI-based change, no vote is needed. People can just do whatever they like.

No, naked shorts (and other uncollateralized obligations) don’t make markets less efficient. As long as people state what they’re actually selling, counterparty risk is priced in. One way getting rid of arbitrary short sells makes markets *less* efficient is that it eliminates certain hedging strategies (for example, if you hold a metals ETP, you can reduce your delta on copper by doing naked copper shorts). There’s no more risk than a located short, but with a piecemeal understanding of markets it’s easy to believe this is bad somehow.
