No iOS for me, Android and Windows right now, but I appreciate it the insight

You're exactly right, it's the same thrill as gambling. And, if I'm being perfectly honest with you, I actually really do like gambling. However, I don't like to gamble because I think I'm going to hit the jackpot or whatever, it's not about the money, I like to gamble because I'm weird and I like numbers and calculating odds and values of things. But your point remains the same and is a good reminder so I appreciate it.

I meant that in the sense of having not spent, sold, or used any btc yet I really haven't lost anything. I bought something in a volatile market for a specific amount with the full knowledge that even minutes later it may not be worth the same amount I paid. I suppose I meant it didn't bother me because I still have the same amount of btc regardless of what the value is, and that I didn't panic and sell because of a fall in price. And you're absolutely right, I'm already in love with bitcoin

Eh, for me it's entertainment. I put it in the same category as dropping a hundred bucks at the bar or at a nice dinner or something like that. I don't expect to get it back but I can have fun playing blackjack or roulette at the same time. Now I probably haven't gone to a casino in a year or so and I've never gone above my limit so I'm not super concerned about getting in over my head.

I used coinbase. It was incredibly simple to use. I didn't fully understand how the markets worked so I figured it was the best place to start. Now I think I'm ready to get a wallet that I have more control of.

I appreciate the warm welcome from everyone and had a few more "back to basics" questions for you guys. It seems like there are a ton of contradicting opinions and viewpoints about wallets, markets, and other btc tools. Is there a general consensus on the best way to store/buy/sell coins or does it really just come down to personal preference? Like I said, I'm new to this but I'm fascinated with it and want to learn as much as I can. Is there anything I may have missed and need to know/do while I'm learning the ins and outs of bitcoin?

I was having trouble summarizing my thought process so I probably didn't word it the best but I know exactly what you mean and I get how it works. But you are right and I appreciate it.
