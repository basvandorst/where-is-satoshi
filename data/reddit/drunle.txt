What? Exit plan? Unless this hits 1 million, where I probably would just sell off some, then it's HODL till then.
@_date: 2017-08-29 22:20:11
Dangggg I'm just hoping all upwards since that's been the trend even in low volume. People HODLing like crazy!
@_date: 2017-08-29 22:19:37
It's like why would people be mad at me making speculation. r/litecoin is all moons and lambos, tryna spread the holiday joy. Here's to 5k!

@_date: 2017-08-30 03:26:12
exactly, the price was down for merely a few hours. i thought i should panic sell but by the time I thought it was a good idea, it was back up. when i tell people about bitcoin, they seem so amazed by it and I can tell they're gonna go home and look it up. This is just the tip of the iceburg
@_date: 2017-08-31 17:45:10
I predicted a bull run 3 days ago: 
Not like I knew where it was going but I felt it in the cards. This is still a mini run too. Once that volume picks up we'll see even more gains. I'm seeing 5.1k as next target.
@_date: 2017-08-15 17:59:49
The real question is: why do you want it to? And why do you think that if it dropped that low, it wouldn't drop lower? Unless you buying like 10 btc just buy now, the few hundred won't make a difference a year from now, guaranteed.
@_date: 2017-08-30 06:48:02
My powers are growing every minute.... I can feel it
@_date: 2017-08-14 01:39:45
Obviously. Maybe I was just thinking it's more likely that litecoin could hit 90 before btc hit 8000 but who knows.
@_date: 2017-08-28 05:16:27
Kind of a long bull pennant. The last drop took us to 3600. This one (so far) took us to 4200. I'm hoping this means the support is rising although its hard to tell when the volume is so low and litecoin is really taking the spotlight in the crypto realm.

Hopefully in a week you'll be glad you read this post. Who knows though. ltc gettin all the post segwit attention D:
@_date: 2017-08-17 16:40:17
TBH I thought it would be a good idea short term to get out at 43-44 and wait for a drop. But it's so hard to predict and you never get the exact top or bottom of anything.
@_date: 2017-08-30 04:07:12
Usually they just don't understand how to obtain it. I tell people coinbase and move on when you're ready to GDAX
@_date: 2017-08-10 04:37:50
Perfect, let's get on this
@_date: 2017-08-22 04:38:57
Dip no different, last major dip took about 30% off the price, so expect this dip to possibly go to 3000ish. I'm no genie but it could certainly happen before the next huge pump. If you looked at it a year from now it'll be higher so I'd just buy more now and maybe in the next day or two. Dollar cost average loo it up

@_date: 2017-08-16 22:48:11
I mean it's not guaranteed but the asian markets are waking up soon and the price could go up nicely. Maybe not though and the weekend is looming although ever since August 1st the price has almost continuously gone up.

Yeahh definitely are, I think this was aired a year ago. If only I had bought then D:
@_date: 2017-08-29 22:21:23
I mean 3 months of watching this daily, I think I can pick up on trends pretty quick. No crypto genius, just good at watching charts and picking up on bull runs. When the price is this stable with relatively low volume, all it would take was some big news or a couple of huge buys to get this craze going.

**for those newer to btc** not everyone was so lucky to buy back when it was uber cheap
@_date: 2017-08-13 18:46:47
I think we'll see 6k even quicker. The hysteria hasn't even kicked in yet and it's going up this fast. I think 10k by years end or early next year.
@_date: 2017-08-14 02:33:50
Hello bitcoin, could I speak to your manager?
@_date: 2017-08-19 20:56:19
Who knows, I heard most of the people in the know buy their bitcoin early to stock up. It's not like on that day there's some notification popping up when you go to buy btc reminding you that segwit is activated so I think it'll be just like any other old day in the crypto world.
@_date: 2017-08-28 05:18:25
Thanks I try
@_date: 2017-08-17 01:22:18
10k by next year. 100k within 5 years. All the HODLers can dream
@_date: 2017-08-24 22:02:32
I do this on GDAX and it's definitely quite profitable if you can put over to litecoin when it's falling then back over to btc when it's at the bottom. No fees either as long as you're a maker, not a taker
@_date: 2017-08-13 20:52:49
Family guy at least mentioned it, haven't heard it much anywhere else on tv except the news here and there
@_date: 2017-08-14 18:32:42
Personally I would buy now and ride it out till around 5000ish, then sell off and see what happens.
@_date: 2017-08-29 21:26:29
Won't know till this one is over, jeez never enough for you people. And I wouldn't call this an epic bull run. If the volume hits like 25-30k on GDAX, I'll call that an epic bull run.
Probably the next huge bull run will be like Sept 12th? Just a guess but I called the last few ahead of time.
RemindMe! Sept 12th, 2017
@_date: 2017-08-31 18:04:06
My theory is the only people crazy enough to sell right now are daytraders who buy back in a lil lower for a profit. Until the train leaves the station too quickly, then they'll just HODL. I'm thinking the next target is 5.1k for sure. The closer we get to 10k, the faster it's going to go up probably.
@_date: 2017-08-24 02:10:21
Hell yeah joining the segwit party here. I mean it's kicked in but it'll take a little bit for people to learn about it and the upswing will kick in then. I'm hoping for tonight but if not, it's coming in the next week.
@_date: 2017-08-16 06:21:12
poop disaster. well i suppose we ain't going higher than before. sometimes it ain't so bad to take a few bucks profit. we'll see what happens. crashes don't matter if you're thinking a year or two from now. and hour long videos don't necessitate a crash.
@_date: 2017-08-15 08:47:33
Just tell em to fuck off, plain and simple

Now you're welcome, where's my btc prediction tip?
@_date: 2017-08-21 15:41:44
Day trade on GDAX. You can set limit orders for whatever price you want and leave them till they get filled.
@_date: 2017-08-30 01:37:19
You know it's gonna happen soon. Don't deny it. I literally saw a "buy bitcoin" sign at walmart the other day. The mass adoption is coming.
@_date: 2017-08-30 02:16:46
i'm just lookin at the charts, it isn't rocket science. If it doesn't stay dipped down for long, then it's gonna go up after the consolidation period. 5.1k being the next target. The closer it gets to 10k the faster it goes up. Dips are essential to go higher. boom we rich
@_date: 2017-08-22 08:13:33
3600 seemed to be the new floor. Weird, exactly double from the last floor of 18xx. a lot of people still looking to sell out though. it'll probably test the 3600 floor again in the next day. segwit(lower fees, good thing) activates wednesday but i doubt that could change this market from the current bear status. keep buying in. you'll be pleasantly surprised when the prices jumps past it's last ATH of 4500
@_date: 2017-08-13 19:51:24
something is better than nothing i suppose but i agree
@_date: 2017-08-13 11:20:14
Oooh that's gotta hurt. So basically you lost out and are now hoping your mistake will befall on one of us smart hodlers? No thanks bud, I'll keep my money where it's safe. Not too late to buy back in and ride the train home. You only lost out if you wait longer and it's at 5k.
@_date: 2017-08-31 18:14:12
When people start a selling off wave. Not for a while. Right now everyone is HODLing, only day traders are selling out. Don't wait to buy the dips because it doesn't always happen. We've been going up like 100 a day so this is probably the start of a larger bull run. Something tells me Sept 10-12 will be key dates to watch for. Who knows though.
@_date: 2017-08-16 18:19:00
Throw in the 17000 at some point. Keep the 20000 in savings just in case. Buy 2btc right now, then buy the other 2 during the next dip.
@_date: 2017-10-28 06:21:06
Dang mobin couldn't hack it, he strung himself up like a pruppet!
@_date: 2017-07-01 22:26:43
the price is pretty much decided on how much someone is willing to pay for bitcoin. Back in the day it was only like $1 because not too many people were on board with it, whereas now it's becoming more widely adopted as an alternative method to currency. Therefore increasing it's value. More people buying in=higher value. More people selling off=lower value
