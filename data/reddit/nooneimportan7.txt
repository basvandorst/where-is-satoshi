Actually someone who (allegedly) works at GoDaddy said they were told to stop working, and start voting.

I may be mistaken but the company mentioned - L3 - makes those sweet 4 tube night vision goggles. Just a fun fact.

No, I mean the more people talk about things they should've done in hindsight, and wax poetic about their great bitcoin endeavors the lower the price is.
It's always "remember when it was xxxx?!?" Or "man I should've sold at xxxx"
You can say that about anything.

The hindsight game is why I can't talk to people about bitcoin. I swear the price is inversely proportionate to the amount of nostalgia.

Well, I stupidly have only been talking about/reading about BTC a lot for the last few weeks. This $10k hit is what made me finally log back into coinbase after years of not even thinking about it. Here's to it.

Well, it is a joke. The title of the post is a joke, it's misleading to someone who doesn't know.

Didn't see this thread in the last 10 minutes...

Could've only been worse if it was dubstep.

I've got a similar story. Heard about it years ago, told some people, was too confused to get into it, someone mentioned it a few months ago, obviously should've listened closer.
The problem at the moment is the signal to noise is terrible right about now. Between bigger media, poorly managed websites, complete amateurs thinking they're day traders... I'm sitting back and learning what I can/waiting for some of the hysteria to die down.

Should there be a "this is not a subreddit for financial advice" on the sidebar?

This will go up and down, every minute, every hour...
