Great explanation! Was the original intention to be able to harness the blockchain for other uses outside of just currency or is that something that was added in after its inception? I still can't wrap my head around how the blockchain was thought up and how much they seem to have planned for future innovation with it. It's amazing! 1000 bits

I order from you guys all the time and have always been amazed with the quality of both the products you carry, and the customer service you provide. Now this is just the icing on the cake :) Cheers! 3000 bits

Some nice looking pieces there. If I get this job I interviewed for, I'll be sure to place an order sometime next week for the BTC cause :)

Hi there! I've got a joke for you (some adult language)

Great advice, but serious question.
For those of us in the US, if we've been smart before, we have to be mindful of the tax implications of withdrawing money, which leads me to my question...
If we hedge our bets and transfer a portion of our holdings into something like Coinbase's USD Wallet, are we responsible for taxes on that if we plan on reinvesting that and never withdrawing it?
As a long time holder, I'm trying to figure out a way to dump some of my coin high for this bubble and get back in low but do so legally. I've basically been buying $50 worth of bitcoin every paycheck for the last ~3 years so I'm decent shape and have already come to grips on losing it all if it happens since it's basically money I would've spent on booze.
