Bitcoins blockchain has very limited usecase. Thats not true for other blockchains where you can do smart contracts

80% of hashing power belonging to china is security? Proof of work wont be the safest mining protocol. Not to mention energy effiency

If you look the competition LN is already obsolete. Mainstream user will never open LN channel. It is just too complicated. In addition it is not fee less like competitors are. I have really hard time understanding what makes bitcoin best in the long term. Only strength it has is brand and that is fast moving asset in the technology space.
@_date: 2019-07-05 12:32:50
What makes nano shitcoin?
@_date: 2019-07-05 08:59:27
If LN is really that flawed and will never be mainstream-friendly how bitcoin can remain the biggest crypto?
@_date: 2018-09-13 12:06:07
Sure it will be the granddaddy for store of wealth. But that's only minor part of whole crypto and blockchain ecosystem
@_date: 2018-05-27 11:44:06
You really have no clue if you think that bitcoin has any developer advantage. Ethereum is miles away already and keeps growing. 
@_date: 2018-05-06 10:23:51
It's not stupid measurement. Gives information what coins are popular 
@_date: 2017-03-17 09:31:30
What worries me most that this kind of posts are coming now so frequently. How is it possible that bitcoin is the safest blockchain when chinese miners have control of it?  It is little bit too much denilaism from facts. If bitcoin would work well then segwit would be already implemented and this civil war wouldnt exist.
@_date: 2018-06-09 08:39:26
As a former bitcoin maximalist it's now weird to read posts like this. I think that there is huge market for all cryptos not just bitcoin. Smart contracts alone are essential part of what blockchain can do and bitcoin doesn't support smart contracts 
@_date: 2018-06-07 07:42:23
And some people still think that bitcoin is most secure and decentralized blockchain... It is becoming quite obvious that pow-mining is flawed and there is no solution to that. At some point 51% attack is possible and it will be done likely from jihan
@_date: 2019-08-16 12:34:22
So basically the same reasons why bitcoin maximalists hate other cryptos...
@_date: 2019-06-24 14:23:04
Do you disagree that bitcoin's tecnology is shit compared to many altcoins?
@_date: 2018-06-09 08:27:52
DAI from makerdao. Real stablecoin with collateral and not scam like tether
@_date: 2019-02-06 21:15:39
From technical point of view its not. There are more scarce coins that are also much faster. 
@_date: 2019-06-24 17:14:20
I mean those coins that have 0% inflation, have instantaneous  transactions and have no fees. Cant see why bitcoin would stay ahead with that kind of competition.
@_date: 2017-11-10 09:16:16
They will. Bitcoin's market cap has collapsed in less than a year from 90% to 58%
@_date: 2019-02-23 03:40:25
For now also bitcoin have had ever increasing supply and will have for many decades. Ethereums inflation is going to be zero in few years. 
@_date: 2019-04-07 16:02:06
Because its not bitcoin´s blockchain where those things are build in large scale. 
@_date: 2017-04-26 22:33:33
Wow these threads are so quiet nowadays. Year ago there would have been at least 1000 comments and high excited atmosphere. That is gone
@_date: 2018-11-10 23:55:58
And you think that's something that shouldn't be improved? How the fuck crypto can be useful innovation if it's not great for commerce that is basic need for a functional currency?
@_date: 2019-01-03 00:34:59
If we want average joes to use bitcoin instead of faster coins how easy it is to use lightning? Its a huge issue that will matter a lot. 
@_date: 2019-01-14 23:12:03
And when and how bitcoin gets that? 
@_date: 2019-01-02 23:37:15
Are transactions speeds low right now? Been sending other cryptos recently and got used to that transaction is finalized within minute. Now I have been waiting btc transaction to go through over 10 minutes... Feels very annoying 
@_date: 2018-02-13 10:44:36
It's even better. But that is something that is not allowed to say here. 
@_date: 2018-04-13 22:14:02
Wow weird to see that someone who is pro bitcoin has so limited understanding what blockchain can do. Bitcoin is only the first application. Smart contracts will change world same way as internet have. Don't be so narrow minded and bitcoin maxinalist. 
@_date: 2018-04-13 12:39:03
How is TA worthless? Every major indicator has shown over last week that we are over sold and bottom is forming. This rise was very predictable
@_date: 2017-05-10 09:47:52
The biggest momentum and excitement has shifted to altcoins. I think the reason is that bitcoin is quite boring. There is scaling debate and then some stores start accepting bitcoin's. There isn't any exciting news and development that is going on with altcoins
@_date: 2017-05-30 07:50:41
If this scaling scandal continues and ethereum keeps its pace then number of people who own 1 bitcoin is much fewer...
@_date: 2018-12-20 20:23:15
Wow. Never seen this kind of level bitcoin maximalism. Wouldnt it be easier to begin accept that bitcoin isnt and will never be only cryptocurrency? 
@_date: 2018-12-05 17:21:41
Decentralized exchanges do exist. Like kyber and Idex.
