They are synonymous. Laws restrict your freedom. No laws give you absolute freedom. 
Wait are you saying you want a Mix of Laws and Freedom? Oh, but see that requires an entity to manage what the freedoms and the laws are. But they aren't God, they can't get it right 100% of the time, are you saying you want some input to try and make sure they get it right as close to 100% of the time as possible. 
Hm.. That's fucking ingenius. We should do away with the *government* and build one of these entities.. We can call it.. the fucking, government.

You don't want an empire. You are surely allowed to move. This is a free society, you have your human rights and those can't be taken away. We slavery is outlawed. Taxation and Regulation are not slavery.
How much freedom do you want though? What exactly is freedom? 
* You want monopolies to not be impeded?
* Free to drive on whatever side of the road we want?
* Free to kill people who piss us off?
That's lawlessness, not freedom.

I think Bitcoin has already gone to the moon when it hit 100 (and even less than that). 
The earliest adopters who stuck on the shuttle are now rich as hell. (Goat, Theymos, The guy who made the movie recently, the guy who put the $100,000 bounty out).
We are now on the wave of innovators that help carry the shuttle to mainstream. (Coinbase, AsicMiner, Circle, BitPay, DarkMarket, BTC Atms)
The earliest adopters got it from Earth to Orbit to the Moon. Now the innovators have hitched on for the ride and can take it all over the solar system (e.g. the mainstream). 
Now imagine how close the Moon is to Earth compared to how far the Moon &amp; Earth are from everything else in the solar system.
We've already come so far and have reached the moon. (Bitcoin was brought into the media spotlight, even if only for a little while). But we have a much much farther way to go. (Bitcoin has a house hold name, Coinbase or BitPay or Circle as synonymous with the term money as Vise or Master Card or BoA.)

It's just a little hard to wrap your head around. I could say the same thing decades ago about Coke stock. It's only pennies, no way I can buy a bunch of these and be rich when I'm older.
You think BTC can't really hit 10k or 100k because well you might own some now, it seems *too easy* to make money (I mean who will buy them for 100k each? CRAZY!!!) if I just buy these and hold them for a little while, I mean anyone could do that.
That's the point though; anyone could do it, but out of the dozens of people I told BTC about back when they were 80$ not one of them took the initiative to look into. They listened to whoever called it a Ponzi scheme and now they ask me how they can get some and how much money I have made off them. 
**First Mover Advantage** is a very powerful weapon, the very first people in BTC were getting them for less than pennies, the next people were getting them for pennies, the next people were getting them for dollars, the next people were getting them for a couple bucks, then the next people were getting them for $30 or $40, and then the next people were getting them for $80-$120, then $200, then  now people are getting them for $800. (With some extreme ups and downs in between). Do you really think we are at the end of the price increase when we finally have legitimate companies coming out to build industries around this new technology? I think we are at the beginning.
@_date: 2014-05-12 18:21:07
Never encouraged people to buy, encouraged them to look it up and read for themselves. Told people who've asked me about Bitcoin what it is and how it works in simple layman terms and how this is different than the status quo. Showed them past performance along with elaborated on risks involved previously and moving forward. I have been offered money to invest for people which isn't something I am comfortable with but it seems most people love to talk about it but don't have the energy to actually break the barrier to entry. I've lead plenty to the water, they just haven't really got a drink.

Yeah or just one major app. Just like how iPhone has the square to process credit card payments. Just have a Bitcoin app for merchants that does exactly this. Have different modes for different types of places. Bars will have something exactly like this. Restaruants might have you include your table number, clothing stores and etc.. will let you pay for the items as you pick them up at the rack if you want them and will keep a complete tally, then as you leave the store you can show the entire tally of what you paid for and see if it matched up.

Hm.. Yes but gold has been around for ages, I find it weird that something that is worth $1 today and $2 tomorrow doesn't have all the money in the world in it already. 
Bitcoin is like gold. It is a nice store of value, but it **can** also be used to invest, buy things, and send money cheaply all the way around the world. People are implusive beings, we can save money from our paycheck, or we can go and get that Starbucks every morning, and get that new flatscreen TV that just came out.
Just because Bitcoin rises in value as time goes on doesn't mean that people won't cash out of it, or use it to buy stuff or use it to invest, it just means people **might** take a little more time to way the pros and cons of saving it versus spending it.  
@_date: 2014-05-19 19:09:09
Thanks, yeah your story is pretty cool.
 
Most people get into BTC and say "Ok so how do I get rich right now, without doing any work." but you show a strong level of maturity and creativity. You operated in one of the Freest Markets on this planet (Little to no regulation) and showed you can not only hold your head in it but also thrive in it while bringing a service to others.

You are right, I don't believe you. 
(I never used Gox, but I think everyone who was burned by Gox has a right to be angry at Karpelles). He lied and was deceptive. I don't think people are mad at him for his ignorance, but his desire to act like he wasn't ignorant and try to pass blame, lie and cheat his way out of a tough situation. Strictly business as you say.

The Winks are going to have to security auditing to be listed on Nasdaq, this is a very good guarantee that your BTC is secured even if you don't know any of the technical aspects of how to secure your coin. Not only this, they will be require to do financial audits to make sure nothing fishy is going on.
It allows players to get into BTC and catch the waves while still being in a regulated environment, which contrary to popular belief is actually a good thing for a lot of reasons. Compared to a lot of the unregulated aspects of BTC that ends up burning a lot of people. (Not that I'm against no regulation or for regulation, IDC either way)

I'm not looking for deeper intellectual discussions about Bitcoin. This is the first place people go, so trying to trick them and manipulate them is a very bad thing to do. Which a lot of the post and comments on this subreddit do. Honestly I think I am one of the kindest people on here, if someone has a legitimate question. I will definitely direct them to the answer if I don't know it myself.
But how do you answer: "OMG BTC IS CRASHING, SELL NOW!?!?!?" when it is post 50 times a day? You can't, this is pure manipulation at its lowest form. I won't fall for it, you won't fall for it. But someone who just bought their first BTC yesterday might. 
Screaming "The feds are rounding us up! Omg guys it's over" in 20 different post is the same thing. It's all manipulation in the most unrefined form. I don't think it belongs on this subreddit because it takes away from actually helping people find their way through the Bitcoin community and the great things that happen here.

Niether dogecoin or bitcoin is an exclusive community, you can be a part of both at the same time. This subreddit is for the spread of Bitcoin information. Not dogecoin information, not litecoin information, not ethereum information. Bitcoin information and overall cryptocoin information that applies to Bitcoin. 
This isn't a terrible community, we just don't need to go around tipping people 50 cents everyday (I mean what are you going to really do with 50cents?). This isn't a charity subreddit anyways. We help people out with understanding concepts in Bitcoin, news that relates to Bitcoin, and security and safety while traversing your way through the Bitcoin community. 
We don't need to be overly nice and give people 25 cents when they say they are new here. We can give them far more value by telling them the benefits of cryptocurrency and the path bitcoin is on.

They don't advertise peace and open markets Erik. They advertise that we break the laws because they don't like the laws and that we avoid paying taxes because they don't like paying taxes.
I'm not a fan of my current government in any way shape or form. But I am able to take a step back and understand why regulation is good. 
I mean we see every week that someone is losing their BTC to a scam, a company being hacked, etc, etc.. Hell, not all your investors were happy with you. (Though I was).
If you want to get to the moon, then you need to understand that the mainstream needs regulation or they will all be robbed within a fortnight, they will swear off BTC and BTC will continue to get a bad wrap.
People come on here and scream "BTC should be X,Y,Z and the Government should fuck off." for their own selfish reasons. We don't need that, it is only painting the community in a bad light. I believe most of these same people are trying to paint their ideals on BTC that might not match up with the rest of the community. BTC is a great piece of technology, it isn't your Golden Ticket to fuck over the government.

I know he doesn't directly point to that guy. But he does use the phrase


Implying more than the one incident he is talking about. I am just trying to show that his assumptions are not exactly true because they don't apply to *all* let alone *most*. 
If people take the time to research how to accurately secure their coins, they won't get stolen. This alone should show that the people who are getting their coins stolen, or losing them by betting are not taking the necessary precautions or even understanding the risks they are undertaking. 
For example, Just because you use 2FA doesn't mean your coins are secure. That also doesn't prove that you are *Technologically smart*. Also, just because you worked at Microsoft for 10 years (probably making you *technologically smart*) working in their R&amp;D department doesn't mean that you know how to accurately secure your coins and know exactly which businesses in the Bitcoin-sphere are trustworthy. 
It's a bumpy road while BTC grows.

If it didn't take Bitcoin would you have any compliants with the Feds going after him? No because what hes doing is wrong (in the legal sense, not the moral one). Bitcoin isn't some shield that protects you from the law. (or from taxes like some people in this subreddit think)

Getting into college is a zero sum game.
Getting into the bathroom in the morning first w/ roommates is a zero sum game.

Getting that heart transplant is a zero sum game.
"A discovery isn't a zero sum game?" Well duh, but wait. Someone else can't make that discovery now that Dr. DiscoveryMaker made it, so the fame might be a zero sum game. 
It's all a zero sum game. Even my classes in Uni right now are a zero sum game. (Most are curving for only 10% of the people getting an A, it's a competition). 
Making a successful business is a zero sum game.
Water is a zero sum game.

Dealing with scammers in BTC is not reactionary it is precursory. It is very hard/near to impossible to get BTC back from someone who hacked you or scammed you. It is far easier to protect your addresses/walelts with **SECURE AND ONLY SECURE** backups and 2FA. 
Too many people have been scammed for not using reliable 2FA, downloading very malicious applications on their laptops &amp; phones, keeping backups in their emails and dropboxes. These are all easy access to your coins. If you have invest $2000 in BTC. Go buy a chromebook for $100-$200, put Ubunto on it and make it your cold wallet. Or make a very good paper wallet and put it in a safety deposit box. Put your back up on some Flash Drives and put those in a safety deposit box.

Yes. Because people would still have to buy and sell BTC. The more people who use it as a payment processor, the more money that would have to go through BTC's hands.

If I had 1000 BTC on Coinbase, I wouldn't mind if it took 24 Hours to get it off coinbase, because I have a stronger trust for them. I know exactly who is involved and I know their qualifications.

I understand that. I'm not one who preaches of BTC reaching the moon. I understand the risks involved, I understand that BTC is in a grey area with regulation and legalities. 
I also understand that right now if things continue as they have then BTC will only be getting bigger. Now I'm not saying it's gonna rush to the stars but year after year BTC has become more present and more valuable since it's birth. If there was a vulnerability in BTC it would have **probably** have been exposed by now. I mean we know about the 51% attack.

Going outside of and tipping really does have it's benefits. You are showing the a unique way to transfer money that hasn't been done before cryptocurrency. You are tipping one person but maybe a hundred or a thousand people will see that tip and be like "wow what the hell is this, let me check our It brings a lot more benefit to this subreddit and the people who see the tip than just the 50 cents that you give to someone.
Tipping in this subreddit is different. We know what Bitcoin is here and we know about the tipping. You are no longer breaking the ice to start a discussion or pique someones interest, you are now just giving someone 50 cents that they probably won't even take out of their reddit wallet. It really serves much less purpose than tipping people who don't already know about bitcoin.
I am 100% for tipping inside of this subreddit and outside of it, I just think that it doesn't really need to happen in this subreddit on every post or comment because it doesn't really do much but clog up post with "thank you"s and "oh tip me too"s.
I believe we were talking about just this subreddit so I am trying to show that this subreddit is infact welcoming, nice and not this *terrible* place that was described in the OP.

Best to create entirely new paper wallets and always sweep them when you do a transaction. This keeps the public key from being brodcasted to the network in your new paper wallet. 
There is a very small (remotely, extremely, *almost* negligible) chance someone can get your private key through your public key. 
Check Evil-Kineval (i think this is the correct username) on Bitcointalk.org He has done this to some wallets that are not did not have good RNG.

Yeah I stepped out partially during the semester and decided to get back in when finals started because I knew I wasn't going to have much time to watch the prices so I didn't wanna miss the boat and felt the risk would have been worth it if the price dropped. I've been bearish since December, I felt like $1200 was too fast a climb, unfortunately I didn't step out until around $600~700 because I've been preoccupied to make an informed decision. 
I took a leap of faith yesterday actually before I went to the library to study, and what do you know the bulls are coming out to play. If the price continues to go up it's 100% based on luck any money I make off this lol. 
EDIT: Not to say that I didn't have money in Bitcoin, I just have more money in Bitcoin now then I did two days ago.

Yes this is with the assumption that Bitcoin grows and becomes successful. If Bitcoin grows, then everyone inside of Bitcoin should be relatively successful. Some more than others, but contrary to popular belief. 
One's success does not negate another's. We don't stand in anyone else's shadow. 
@_date: 2014-01-30 18:37:32
Yes people will still buy stuff, as bitcoin becomes mainstream and it's price rises it's value will rises slower. If each coin is worth 100k, it's not going to just jump up to 200k. And then people will only have like .005 of a coin or something, so if bitcoin rises by 10k in the span of a year, them holding it and starving themselves for a year would have only netted them $50

I think a complete divorce from USD and other currencies won't be happening any time soon and I don't think this is the endgame we should be seeking.
I see the endgame of digital currencies being the point in which we are able to freely exchange one currency for another based on what we wish to use it for. At this point all currency won't be equal (e.g. they all can't be used for the same thing).
We might have BTC has a store of wealth and a quick/secure/cheap way to send vast amounts of money, yet it won't be good for cheap,fast transactions. When we need to do one of these we exchange some BTC for a different currency that could be used for Gambling, or micro-transactions, or even a regional currency. 
Of course, the endgame would just be the beginning though. I don't think innovation will ever stop, there might come a day when digital currencies like BTC are relics of the past.

The MIT word play paints this misconception that everyone that goes there is some super genius top tier hacker who can create a successful billion dollar start up with the flick of his wrist.
Obviously not the case. 
I don't think people quite understand how little time most people have when they take high level dense stem classes. And how little experience college students have in creating a product, a service or running a business, let alone turning BTC into some type of global utopian currency of the missives.  
Want BTC to succeed? Poker, Gambling, Weed, Prostitution, avoiding the government, Porn, Buying shit anonymously, keeping your money out of government reach, making it easily accessible and moveable, you know all the shit it does now, you don't put your hopes in dreams in some college kids.

With this maybe we can get the Mods to ban threads that ask repeated questions. "Should I buy bitcoin?" "Should I mine bitcoin?" "What price do you think bitcoin will drop to?" "How far away until we are all rich?" "OMG is this the end?" "How many bitcoin do you have?"
Maybe we should start weekly threads to condense these ideas so that we just have 1 repeatable thread for each topic a week instead of 20-50.
* How many Bitcoins did you buy this week? Any reason why? BBW Thread (Bitcoin Buy Week).
* Prediction Thread.
* The Next Big Thing in Bitcoin Thread.

Never said Dogecoin wasn't necessary. Man I feel like you didn't even read what I said. I'm saying that Bitcoin is not this *terrible* subreddit just because it doesn't throw coin at users for every post they make.

Yes we should expect people to mine for no compensation. Greatest idea ever.. 
Listen guys, Bitcoin wasn't made to make you guys rich because you got some before other people. That's just a pyramid scheme. 
Miners are not overcompensated or everyone would be a miner. 9/10 If you don't know what you are doing then you would be better off just buying Bitcoins than mining them. 
The amount of money miners will make (in BTC) will continue to go down every 2 weeks because the difficulty will continue to rise, I don't think we've had one 2 week instance where the difficulty went down. 
In a few years it won't be 3600BTC a day it will be 1800BTC a day. When that time comes Miners will be making less and less BTC wise and most people who are not commercial/professional miners who work for a Mining Corp  will have a much harder time making money from Mining. Even if the price of BTC skyrockets, difficulty will just skyrocket a long with it as Corp. Miners will come into more funds to reinvest.

The problem is Bitcoin isn't just one community. It's a bunch of small communities glued together because they were all presented with an item or an idea, and they all saw something different out of it that really peaked their interest.
It just so happens that the most outspoken community in the Bitcoin world right now are the people who have the money and want to be able to legitimately work in America using Bitcoin. 
Is this bad? For some of us it is, because we had different plans with BTC, for others no, because it secures their investment in BTC just a little bit more. This is the reason there are so many Crypto currencies, I think as time moves on these groups that all flocked to BTC will start to diverge and each might grab its own currency that works the way they want them to. 
Maybe a currency that is untraceable in some way so you can securely send money from A to B without it being traced. Maybe used to send messages to journalist about corruption or used in revolutions and revolts. 
(unfortunately I can't come up with any other ideas, I'm not too creative at the moment but I hope you understand what I am saying.)

Money = Power. To take power away from the banks you must take their money away from their. Bitcoin circumvents their illicit activities with layman's money and the ridiculous fees they charge. By using Bitcoin you are taking the power away from them and cutting into their profit margin. 
The BTC price is tied heavily into how much power BTC has. If BTC was worth a $1 each then it has no power, $21,000,000 is nothing. We need Bitcoin to be worth more wether we want to get rich off of it or not. 
Bitcoin prices hit $266, Bitcoin was put in the news for arguable the first time. Bitcoin prices break $1000, Bitcoin has been in the news/magazines pretty much every day since. Bitcoin hasn't completely crashed back down to pre $1000 prices ( BTC &lt; $500) Companies are coming out to support Bitcoin and allow you to buy goods with it. Governments are actively looking into supporting/regulating/officially accepting it into their country. 
Now Imagine whose going to back Bitcoin when it hits $10,000, when it hits $100,000. The rate of growth of Bitcoin's price is its strongest marketing piece at the moment even with the amazing things it does. Money talks to every person on this planet. Fee-less Transactions do not, Instantaneous transactions around the globe do not, anonymity does not. 
If you want BTC to be everything it has the potential to be, then it is going to have to cost a lot more than it does now. There are 70 Individual people on this planet that are worth more than BTC right now. You want the power of the dollar in BTC, then stuff like this can not stay true. BTC needs to be worth more than the most valuable company for it to have the impact that people on here want it to have. People can not dismiss something worth more than the most valuable company on the planet, they can dismiss something that isn't  worth more than them.

[Spondoolies]( saying that they have sources saying AsicMiner is selling their chips at cost. **But** that's not the important part for this, the bigger point is that there is a company out there that makes A1 Chips have/are in the process of dishing out 40P/h's worth of chips. (Not sure which company, A1 chips are from)
[Here is them elaborating](
If you want I can show you a post from FC where he is stating that AM is/will be selling/using ~60PHs worth of chips starting around June which should sell/(be deployed) by late July. 
I believe [Bitmine]( (Swiss) is behind the A1 Chips so I actually will retract saying it is only China that is behind and will continue to be behind this new rush.

When BTC first started, there were 50 coins mined every 10mins. Now after 4 years it has been cut down to 25 coins every 10mins. (This is not because of difficulty *bro*, this is a part of the algorithm to assure that only 21million coins exist in 2140). 
Difficulty is affect by the hashrate of the entire bitcoin network. The difficulty can go down if people stop hashing, it recalculates the difficulty and only goes up with more hashrate is on the network. 
I did the math you need to read the rest of the comments in this thread (and every thread like this) and see that everyone is saying you are wrong.

* Public perception hasn't changed. Most of the news you hear about BTC doesn't reach to the mainstream, of course unless BTC price spikes considerably or some catastrophic happens.
* Some places use BTC. But that's not going to make someone pick BTC over a credit card, people get stuck in their ways. Change is hard.
* Great Bitcoin Startups, not many or any of which that bring merit to the common consumer. The only startup I use in BTC is Coinbase. I can't even name 5 legal startups that have been running for a year. (But I have bad memory). 
* Less money is probably going into the Bitcoin space then any other tech field when it comes to VCs. 
We are not even out of the gate yet. There is little incentive to use BTC right now except for some ideological belief, or some speculative desire.
The only thing right now that I think BTC is winning at is remittance to other countries. But most (not all) of the people in BTC are well off white 1st world citizens who were probably born  in the same country that all their family lives in. (no offense).

If you have decent parents who could be bothered to. But what happens when the school is 15 Miles away and you parents don't have the time to drive you to school every day. 


Kids and parents usually can't make the best choice in what is going to be important for members of society to learn, especially if they start to neglect math, and then have kids and tell them "Oh you don't need math Timmy."
This Ideal world you have dreamt up is a figment of your imagination. Regulation exists to help us in the savage world we live in. 


Tax could be more like shopping, you should more directly decide what to build and what not to build (obviously finding funds for roads etc will be easiest as everyone profits).
Until we end up in an Elyisum-esque world where the rich have flocked to one area of the country and the poor to another. The poor will have nothing, less than nothing. Of course, with no country wide tax, now the poor have no way to get basic funding for say.. clean water.


Yeah but it won't be illegal to drive on the left side of the road. Shit I might want to try that tomorrow if I could, especially when there's far less traffic on that side. Shit, fuck the roads, I should just drive on the sidewalk. 


Until one religion decides to do away with the others. 
This is honestly a joke. What world do you live in where you think that you won't be abused in a completely free society.
Shit you don't believe in the flying sphagetti monster? You fucking savage, it's in your best interest that I enslave you right now. Don't worry, it's not illegal at all. 
Your kid should come work for me too while I get him hooked on this cocaine. 
Don't worry he doesn't need to go to school, the job he does for me doesn't involve counting. I just need him out there picking that cotton and spending that money he makes on the coke my brother sells. Fuck why am I even paying him? I should just tell him that I'll break his fucking legs if he doesn't pick that cotton. There's no cops to stop me in this world of yours.

Taxes maintain the infrastructure you used to buy Bitcoins. They maintain the defense force that protects your country. 
They maintain the police force that is used to protect citizens in your country, like yourself.
Why should you have to pay taxes on your job since the government didn't get it for you? They didn't help you at work when you had that deadline coming up. They didn't give you tips for your interview or help you with the sales call. Taxes are an obligation to your community.

Negative, this is incorrect. We are slowly approaching 21,000,000 million coins mined. After that there will be no more mined. It works like Gold, there is no person who is printing gold. Notice how Gold's value, (over the decades) has slowly gone up. 
Hopefully, BTC will weather the storm known as *adoption* and eventually it might have the same fate as gold. Something that doesn't decrease in value as the years go by, instead it might slowly increment in value. 


Notice that people don't buy their groceries in gold. Again Bitcoin might just end up in the mainstream as a store of value and not really something you spend on everyday accessories. You might use it to buy a house or stocks or something, but probably not to buy some cigarettes. I don't go to the Gas station and hand the cashier a gold coin to buy gas.
No new coins will be mined after 21,000,000. No one is going to change that, this consensus will not happen. The moment someone tries to change that (no matter what anyone says) the price of BTC will crash to zero and everyone will have moved on to something else. (I know I will definitely be out of BTC before they try to implement this, and right now you won't find a core developer, a serious miner, or a serious investor who wants to change that number to some higher number).

I think before the average Jo comes in from off the street to the world of Bitcoin, we'll see banks in Bitcoin (omg taboo, salt over the shoulder as we speak). 
I don't know if they are the next big group that will be in Bitcoin but I know that if we want the average Jo to be in Bitcoin then we need the banks in Bitcoin. Why? :
* They trust the banks. 
* Banks will make it a lot simpler and feel a lot more secure to invest in Bitcoin.
* Once the Banks are in, it will say to the average Joe : "Hey man, this isn't a ponzi scheme; this isn't some get rich quick scheme; this is something new.
* Banks can insure against the loses in BTC and can fein secure protection and insurance of people's BTC wallets.
I understand a lot of people in BTC don't want banks involved, the good news is that just because the average Jo keeps his BTC wallet with his bank, that doesn't mean you need to too.

Lets play the game. Hypothetically lets say they buy all the bitcoins.. Now they won't get them cheap, maybe the first 100,000 or so will be under $500. But the rest will be over and counting all the way up to $20,000+ for 1 Coin as they begin to do such a strong buy it will be a shot right to the moon. 
Now what. Bitcoin is dead, only the Government has them and the people who are currently mining. So now miners sell their coins for thousands. 
What about everyone else. They move to another coin, Litecoin, Mastercoin, CoinMade2DaysAgo coin, w/e. They are free to make, people buy those up. The Fed says "Wait.. We need to buy those 2 or people will start using them." So they buy out all of those and people move to a new coin. Rinse and Repeat until the the dollar is worth 0 because the Fed will have to continue to make money to buy these new coins meaning the USD will be the new Zimbabwe dollar.
**Hint: This won't happen. Bitcoin's market cap at the moment is less than many of the richest people's personal net worth. It's insubstantial at the moment.**
Edit: They don't need to spread propaganda about BTC, the media already does that. Their best bet is to go after  all the core Devs and the People who run the largest mining operations. They would surely have more success with that than buying all the coins.

We see post everyday where people lose their coins because of user error. If they want to buy their coins in Wink's ETF (because they don't plan to use them, and just merely speculate) then why is that such a bad thing?
Hell I keep my coins on Coinbase. I rather not fuck around with a paper wallet or some secure hard drive and then accidentally lose my wallet.dat file or misplace the hard drive or some other shit.

It can be regulated through the pipes. It just can't be fully regulated. If you're in the US and you want to buy coins. Coinbase is the safest bet and probably the most widely used. Regulate Coinbase, people don't wanna go through Local bitcoins to dump their coins. 
Regulate the big companies where **most** of the people will buy and sell their coins. This won't really cut down on crime but it will help with tax evasion, and tracking people in the major developed companies. 
Banning Bitcoin is pretty simple also. Make it harder to buy it. If I couldn't buy through Coinbase. I probably wouldn't have bought any Bitcoins ever. Most people are like me, were not all *Fight the Machine* types.

I am saying you are wrong. Mining  for the entire network doesn't slow down due to difficulty. Mining for **you** has slowed down. But not for the network. That is impossible because the algorithm readjust the difficulty for mining based on the hashrate. 
The same number of coins are being mined today as they were 6 months ago. Meanwhile the network difficulty has jumped astronomically since then. 
Difficulty is **only** affected by the hashrate of the network. 3600 coins will be mined today. Same as last week, same as three weeks ago, same as two months ago. (All these days have a different difficulty too.)

I think the best way is to gauge whether they are willing to actually sit down and listen. 
I find trying to introduce people to Bitcoin as extremely hard. I usually mention my interest in it to people and let the word be registered into their brain. Eventually media will hit them with it with some over exaggerated story. (E.g. The November 2013 Climb) and they will hit me up asking about it and I'll fill them in on it then. 
Though this usually is followed by "Man I guess I missed the boat."
One thing that I feel is very subtle but super important is that it is divisible. This goes right over people's heads. So if you bought BTC and you bring it up to people, tell them you bought 1.5 BTC or 1.25 BTC or 1.7 BTC even if you bought like 2BTC or 1BTC and stress that it is divisible. 
People tend to think of BTC as a bunch of the same dollars. So unlike USD where we have a $1, $5, $10, etc.. They think you only have 1BTC or 2BTC or 3BTC or 4BTC, where 1BTC can equal some $X in USD. So how do you get $X+1 or $X +.25 or even $1 USD out of BTC?

If you *have* been looking into it for a long time, then why do you need opinions from people on this subreddit. We aren't financial advisors. The problem is people come on here, take advise from people they don't know an then get screwed and then come on here and complain. 
BTW I gave you my opinion. "nope man."
People come on here (not saying that you are this type of person) and ask this question hoping for "Yeah man all the money is coming, BTC is about to blow up get in now." and they get sold pipe dreams.
 
This is what causes many people on here saying stuff like "Omg I bought in at $1125, and now its crash down to $750, omg should I sell!?!?!" 
I don't think you want to be one of those people. 
EDIT: Look you were just sold a pipe dream in this very thread by How is what he said going to help you make an informed decision? He just threw out some arbitrarily high number and the chance that BTC could be used all of the world by most people and you ate it up.

@_date: 2014-06-05 15:15:08
Yeah but the 32" TV to 60" TV is unrealistic. When we are on the main stage, this exponential growth will be logarithmic growth instead. So the question is. Do you want a 32" TV today or a 36" TV in 4 Months. I would rather watch my shows for the extra 4 Months.
BTC will not climb higher and higher forever it will reach a plateau and steadily climb with very minuscule pumps and dumps along the way, similar to gold. People buy and sell Gold all the time, it was used as a form of barter for centuries, it also operated under the same form of deflation as BTC. 
The moment someone argues about deflation at the level of the price jumping so much from a 32" TV to a 60" TV then they have proven that they don't really understand how deflation works.
Otherwise I could say the reverse about inflation. Would you like a 32" TV today or nothing in 2 Months. Is that true? No chances are you can get that same 32" TV in 2 Months (maybe even a 36" TV) with Fiat. Why? Because it's a mainstream currency and it's rate of inflation and deflation isn't going to be overly dramatic.

Ads that start blasting through my speaker I disagree with. Moving ads that make it harder for computer to actually load the entire webpage I disagree with. There are multiple websites I currently use that get around my adblock. Why? Because they aren't obnoxious. 
Want to support content creators? Buy their stuff, I do that. 
We are going to disagree on this, so I will drop the subject. I mean no offense.

What is there to open source? It's a company not software. The only secret code they really have is their algorithm to get a fair market value for the BTC. 
Someone figured out their previous one and made off with a decent chunk of BTC before he told them that he figured it out. Why would they open source this?
EDIT: I can understand maybe their RNG for their wallet calculator, you should ask them for that then. But its really a moot point since they probably empty out the hot wallets they make for you once they received the payment.

You wish to create a coin where you can control its value compared to other coins..
So you can make a coin where any 1 coin is worth 50 BTC.. At this point you shouldn't even worry about Capital Gains Tax, you'll be rich either way because you have effectively created money out of thin air. Way better than any government has done before you.

Yeah thats all fun and good and stuff but in America ( I believe OP is from there ) taxes do a lot more good than they do harm and no matter how you make the money it is an obligation to pay them.
They pay for the roads your anarchist self uses everyday, they pay for the social security you'll probably benefit from some day, they pay for the education you probably received for free. They pay for your public libraries, your fire fighters, your garbage men and they help pay for thousands (if not millions) of peoples jobs and everything else. Taxes don't just go to some evil men in some dark room. This is a serious question and I gave a serious answer

Your argument is. "Wait two months and get a TV almost twice the size." Because BTC is worth more. This is your argument yes?
This argument/phrase/statement hinges on BTC's price rising (when it is already mainstream) at a rate that can not possibly be sustainable. That is not deflation, that is some sort of Linear or Exponential growth that can not exist forever.
Deflation is more of a Logrithmic growth. Now I have to assume you don't know what any of that is because you would have understood that by now. 
Hint: *Log growth is a much slower growth than linear or exponential; I advise you look up a graph that shows Log(x), x and e^x as x approaches infinity so you can see what I mean.*

A Wallet is software that holds an address. This address is like your home address, it is yourself. In here you can *store* your coins. 
Miners are like the post office, when you want to send your coins from your *home* to another person's *home*, then the post office sees your transaction and takes your coins from A to B. 
Now by the laws of the software, they can not steal your coins during this transaction. They never touch them. But they do verify this transaction happened to the rest of the world. It is officially solidified in Blockchain history. 
Example. I want to send you $50. The I take your public address. Put it on the envelope and put it in my mail box. Every mailbox is checked pretty much every 10 minutes and one lucky miner will find these envelopes and bring it to your mailbox (This means they notify the world of your transaction). It will now be yours. I have no control over it anymore and only you have it. If you lose your key to your house then no one can get in. It is a vault protected against any force in the universe.

Exchanges work differently that sending Bitcoins over the nextwork. They usually keep a HotWallet along with a grouping of ColdWallets. (I Advise you to look up these two terms). 
Instead of sending BTC (Bitcoins) over the network during each trade, they hold onto them in their Hot/Cold Wallets. And do all the trading over their servers, so any fee they charge is their own fee for processing your trade, miners never touch these transactions. 
* You, me, Bob and Joanne send BTC to Bitstamp.com to trade.
* We each do a dozen or so buy and sells as we try to catch the ups and downs.
* None of our BTC leave the wallet we sent it to when we sent money to Bitstamp. They kept the money in their ColdWallet until we decided to pull out our Gains/Losses.
* When we finally decided to pull out of BitStamp.com, then they finally send a BTC transaction over the network for the miners and we get our BTC back to our own personal wallet. 
Ninja Edit: There are definitely people who can end up Buying/Selling a surplus of $1,000,000USD worth of BTC in a day. When we broke the $530 wall earlier this week. Someone put up 1400BTC to try to set a wall to keep the price from increasing. People bought into about 250 of his BTC before he took the wall down and decided to place it higher. These exchanges are highly unregulated and people can be pulling money from God knows where and putting on these exchanges. Expect to be trading against Drug Dealers, Early Adopters, Tech Savy Hackers, whomever, etc.. (Maybe even a Warlord, Gang Head, anyone) on these exchanges. To these people BTC is a real currency (to me too) such that they can keep hundreds of thousands to millions of their dollars in BTC, and they probably do. 
Of course I don't expect this to compare to anything you'll see on wall street (BTC's market cap is just too small to compete against that at this point. It's definitely a small pond, any big fish in this pond will be considered a spec on Wall Street). I expect that if any individual wall street participant decides to get moderately into BTC, then they will be one of the biggest fish around, if not the biggest fish around.

If Anonymity was *so* important to the people here who claim it is. Then they would have surely moved to Darkcoin since that would mean, being anonymous is worth more than speculating on BTC price. 
Since they haven't they are lying for some sort of moral superiority. 
Though it is possible to be truly anonymous in BTC instead of begging and crying and whining to have the developers implement it in the code base for you if you just don't expect everything to be silver spoon fed to you and you go out and practice anonymous habits in the bitcoin space.

Mining difficulty will never decrease voluntarily (I mean in the way where companies decide to stop mining even though it is profitable for them). Difficult will either stay at some stagnate level and decrease/increase a little (until more efficient mining chips come out) or until we reach some peak. 
BFLJosh is lying to you if he has said any of this. Mining will not decrease now that it is in the commercial sphere. The only way it will decrease now is due some event that causes a company to lose it's farm for considerable amounts of time, or BTC crashing or some other altcoin (probably SHA-mineable) making unprecedented gains and drawing attention away from BTC.

The person is and except for the word "Stolen" it is all pretty much true. The problem is that isn't just a mod of the sub, he is the creator of and the owner of  People say Millions of dollars but back when he got the BTC it wasn't worth millions of dollars. It was worth a couple thousand to be used for site upgrades IIRC. Unfortunately he never really upgraded the site and apparently he is starting the upgrades soon. (So either he sold the coins or he still has them and they are worth a lot lot more, and now people want them back. But they are **donations** from 2-3 Years ago).
He doesn't need to name the Mod, everyone knows it is he is referring too. (The creator of bitcointalk.or and and he didn't steal any money. They were donations from 3 years ago when the coins were worth $/pennies. 
Other than that may be involved in shady things but who isn't. If you've done anything with or the securities section on bitcointalk or the gambling section, or the goods section, or messed with silkroad or a bunch of other things in the bitcoin community then you definitely have dealt with shady people around the world and have probably participated in shady things yourself.

Hello. If you plan to make a deadman switch to pass your coins on to your wife. I suggest you write out a tutorial/address to a youtube video/a dvd video explaining how she can access your coins (along with a paper wallet copy of your coins) and securely/safely transfer them to some exchange. **PUT THESE IN A SAFETY DEPSOIT BOX THAT SHE WILL BE GIVEN ACCESS TO IN YOUR WILL**
 If you are in the US you are in luck. Coinbase makes it super easy to sell your coins for a fair market price and get the money safely to your bank. 
I think this is the best route for you to take. You do not need to worry about explaining BTC to her now for her to forget in 5 years when you *might* (won't) die.
This way if you die, she will find out about your coins and be given very specific instructions (tailor made for her by the one who loves her the most in the world for a matter of fact) to show her how to cash in safely to get her coins. 
You can even set up a Coinbase account for her/yourself right now that you won't even have to use until this situation  occurs.
Your instructions won't even need to explain bitcoin. They can just be simple instructions for her to type specific things to specific applications to get specific results. (e.g. Got to blockchain.com, Type in this long chain of letters (case sensitive), go to send, select the number shown and type in this long chain of letters to send to &amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;, go to &amp;&amp;&amp;&amp; and log in using &amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;/%%%%%, go to sell, sell all, wait for your money, I love you honey)

Humans make stupid decisions and act impulsively and emotionally. Pure consensus isn't the best idea either. You need a fully educated society on everyday topic to have a full consensus work reasonably. It starts at the bottom though. Don't like the president? Get a major with your ideology in office, get a Police Chef with your stance on the different issues in office and work up from there. Get a different governor, and a different city council, some different senators and congressman. Start at the bottom and work your way up. It's going to be hard, but clearly it is worth it for you. 
Don't just go out and vote, help on a campaign, donate for the candidates you believe in. Go out to rallies, set up rallies, hold AmA's for your candidate, run yourself.

Yup, at this point it is best that Satoshi doesn't come back (though we have confirmation that he still is around) and leave any more foot prints. This point he puts his own life and everyone he knows at risk, hell. He'll have to be careful when using his Old BTC too if he ever does. 
It's best that Satoshi stays hidden, with him hidden the media and the world can't say "look Satoshi had horrible grades in college" how do we know his code will continue to work correctly? Or "look he did/does drugs/is an alcoholic/other negative thing". If he reappears he becomes the poster child for BTC and a target for anyone who wishes to exploit him, his money, take revenge for their poor financial decisions or use him to further their agenda whether good or not. If Satoshi reappeared (Truly) reappeared, every nutcase in BTC and every crummy media outlet will probably dox him till a Situation like Princess Diana occurs. IMHO

If the US wanted to bring down bitcoin they could do 100 different things. Hunt down the Operators of the Main Pools. Pay off Theymos to fuck over Bitcointalk/shut it down. This wouldn't shut down BTC but it would be annoying a shell. Hunt down the Lead Devs and force them to stop updating it/continuously try to sneak in backdoors in bugs into the code. Shut down websites that sell/buy Bitcoins, make it illegal to be in possession of BTC and start a very strong campaign (though unnecessary) to hunt these people down, etc etc etc etc..

Difficulty is affected by the hashrate, the amount of Bitcoins that come into existence by a certain time is already known. Right now its 25coins every 10mins, and this 25 coins will get halved down to 12.5 coins in (3years?) Difficulty doesn't affect how many coins come into existence, it tries to keep the status quo. 
Difficulty only goes up to keep this 25 coins every 10 mins, and will go down if these blocks aren't being reached every 10mins.

Guys, miners aren't going to agree to a hardfork to force BTC to become anonymous (Shit even the developers won't try and implement it). Why? Because then Wall Street and the Governments and the Financial Institutions will not stick their hands into the candy jar.
But believe me, we want those greedy bastards to stick their long hands into the candy jar. Throw them a bone and let them chase it. 
If you make Bitcoin un-cooperable, if you try to fight regulation completely and completely work around it, instead of try to amend the shittier parts of the regulation then you are saying. 
* No I don't want wall street in BTC.
* No I don't want the Government to make BTC legal.
* No I don't want mainstream to use BTC.
Now if this is the case, then I suggest you look at Drkcoin. That's what they are doing. It's already built for you. 100% anonymous. It's already there.
But the people in BTC (the miners, and the speculators, and the developers) have already shown that they don't want that. 
They aren't going to fork what you want, because it will crush the BTC price. I can promise you that if BTC goes into some super 100% anonymous, *fuck regulation* area, then people will pull the fuck out of it faster than the bullet to the face will kill you. 
You want BTC to be a global currency, but then you don't want it to be regulated...

1. Are these the same people who are telling you how to secure your BTC and then going to lose it? Or is it different people (it is a different set of people, everyone in BTC isn't *smart*. Also smart isn't the same as common sense).
2. I promise you that the guy who lost all that money on Just-Dice isn't one of the Core Devs/Tech people who are innovating on BTC right now. You are grouping him into the wrong group, actually I think he would be in the *non-techy people* group seeing as he didn't realize that his Martingale strategy was doomed to fail. 
3. Lastly, being adept in some field of knowledge does not mean they are adept in all fields of knowledge. The same people who develop, maintain, innovate on hardware/software don't also automatically have a deep understanding on how scams work or how to beat the house in gambling. 
Edit: 


Computer Devs != IT Specialist != Economist

First semester of a CS course. So expected to have little to no knowledge of Computer Science concepts.
1. Title : Bitcoin - The Internet of Bartering.
2. Cover recent history of Bitcoin.
* Silkroad 
* Bubbles (April 2013 $266, Nov/Dec 2013 $1200)
3. How does it work?
* Talk about how it is open source; such that any person on this planet who has access to a computer knows exactly what  the source of the software is and knows when and what every update to the core software is. It is the collaboration of the global sort to speak to control and regulate the source code of the Bitcoin. 
* Talk about the Blockchain - Find a very good example to convey this in laymen's terms.
* Talk about the need of miners, the depreciating value of coins returned for each block, and what happens when almost all coins are mined.
* Talk about the rise of alternate coins.
3. This can lead into a segway of the other aspects of Bitcoin, all we hear about bitcoin is it's purpose having to do with money. But it is so much more. 
* Colored Coins
* "What if instead of having the a piece of paper to express your ownership of a house, or a car, or a stock, or a ticket to an event. Instead you had a coin in a wallet. This coin is everywhere and nowhere, you don't have to worry about losing it and it is proven to express that you own xyz. Think of how easy it would be to trade ownership of this item with someone else, you merely send them the coin and they own the item tied to it."
4. Maybe cover recent events. 
* US Regulation starting to pop up. (It's state in the US and other Countries). 
* Mt. Gox, Silkroad, Labcoin, Neo &amp; Bee, Pirat0 (or w/e that guy was called) - This can lead into the riskiness of BTC and why regulation could be good. 
* Then go into legitimate businesses that have latched onto BTC and have made a strong name for themselves. BitStamp, Coinbase, BitPay, Overstock, Gyft.
* Go into companies that are innovating to bring BTC into the mainstream and consumer market (whether niche or mainstream). DarkMarket, Bitreserve, Circle
Just some shitty suggestions.

If you don't know how mining works, and you don't know **before** you buy the miner if the miner is going to meet ROI when you calculate it with difficulty increases then you should not mine. 
You are not at the step where you can make an informed decision with your friends money. Do not buy a miner unless you know what you are doing and you looked up the necessary information to make the right decision.
Miners know before hand if their machine meets ROI or not, they do the calculations before they buy the miner.

Didn't actually read the OP. One thing I would like to note though is that BTC is good, even great at moving LARGE sums of money around the world in seconds/minutes. I never understood why it had to compete with credit cards, BTC is just one cog in the entire machine of Decentralized currencies, other currencies can be faster and be in more abundance so they can deal with DTD over the counter transactions and with easier numbers to do arithmetic on. This is also why I feel like we don't need a name for mBTC, why not just have a completely different coin for smaller and quicker transactions. 
EDIT: BTC is a secure bank on wheels that can travel faster and cheaper than anything so far, it doesn't also need to be the coin used at each designation tho. We can have Decentralized coins that propagate to the network every minute or something for when you want to buy Starbucks, it doesn't even need to be a deflationary currency either. Save your money in BTC, buy and sell and do loans in some other over the counter coin.

Or China or UK or Canada really. If any first-world country accept Bitcoin and supported it even a little bit then it will be much bigger than it is today. The market cap for BTC right now is a drop in the bucket, you can't link it to your bank accounts, you can't pay taxes with it, you can't really buy goods on a daily basis with it. Imagine if you could at any first world country. With active support for it from the government. Where it isn't called a ponzi scam, or a get rich quick scheme, or doomed to fail, or a huge bubble on a daily basis.

Dogecoin is like the Cryptocoin of Reddit. You'll find a lot more users for bitcoin on bitcointalk.org or other forums, on exchanges, etc.. So while there might be 9X more users on this 1K user on right now is just a drop in the bucket for the actual number of people actively doing something with bitcoin at this exact moment.

1. Regulating will lead to processing fees to pay for regulation. This is not escalating, this is fact. If an exchange has to pay 1,000,000 in regulatory fees just to start up, and then more fees to audit and abide by regulations every year. It's going to hurt their bottom line. They will charge more fees. It's the same reason banks have a bunch of processing fees. No escalating. **Entrapment**: Regulation has 1 purpose, to make sure people are not breaking the law. It is just one part of the bigger picture; we will soon see VC (Virtual Currency) task forces that will probe throw the blockchain and through the companies that operate in it. As long as the media calls it a fertile ground for crime to grow this task force will gain power to go and do as it pleases. 
2.  *right now*, Don't go buy 5 BTC and leave it on an exchange if you want it to be protected. Not everyone wants what you want. Most people were smart enough to protect their coins themselves, people were told not to mess with Mt. Gox since April, if anyone has put coins on Mt. Gox since then, **then it is their fault.** It's time to grow up and have people make smart decisions or learn from the consequences. 
3. I have to disagree. BTC is a global currency, if the US or China or Russia or so and so regulates it then why are other countries going to want to touch it. If the US regulates BTC in such a way that you need to have a US SSN or a US Bank account to buy from a US exchange or a US seller then no one outside of the US can touch that company. Look at Coinbase; no one outside of the US can use coinbase. Why? It's 100% online, Mt. Gox got as big as it did because it was used overseas. Regulation hampers startups to only people who have the money to pay for it. This was said on the NY panel last month, regulation should go immensely slow as to not hamper growth and innovation because regulation hurts innovation. Look at patents, patents are a type of regulation and they hurt innovation on a global scale. The protocol is enough to protect anyone as long as they are careful.

BTC's unofficial motto was something like the "Honey Badger of Money". or something like that for a few people.
"Don't buy more than you can afford to lose". Is investment advice that applies to anything, we have had so many people come onto this subreddit and cry, scream, beg, plead, wail, because of the money they have lost on Bitcoin.
Bitcoin is not guaranteed, on the contrary it's one of the riskiest things out there right now.

Bitcoin is always volatile, that isn't actually news. News when it comes to Bitcoin price is. 
* Extreme non-volatility (As in no 5%+ price fluctuations through the day/week).
* Extreme price increase. +20%
* Extreme price decrease. +20%
* Loses its Rank as  in Market Cap against other cryptos.
* Loses its Rank as  in Highest Exchange Rate per coin against other cryptos.
If it's not one of these things then it will not be news worthy when it comes to BTC price alone. 
Even right now, people are unsure if this price increase will hold. If it does I suspect it will continue to climb as confidence of whales that there is money to be made will increase and nervousness and panic will set in on the smaller players to catch the boat before it takes off.

Barrier to entry needs to be made even smaller. BTC debit cards. Other than that, BTC needs a good marketing team, obviously the foundation seems to be failing at that. Commercials, festivals sponsored by BTC. We are a consumer society and the best way to reach people is through already built platforms. We don't need to reinvent the wheel again. Commercials, Ads.

Of course he paid over market price. This should be obvious, he probably paid well over market price too. Why you might ask? Because it would still be a lot cheaper, safer, more secure, less market moving, and quicker than buying the coins on some exchange.
This should be obvious. Where else can you just dump ~20~40 Million dollars on an exchange and expect to get 30K coins? I wouldn't trust Bitstamp or Kraken with this kind of money at all, (of course they probably deal with more money then this on a daily/weekly basis, but it's still a huge huge huge huge huge risk).
The buyer paid for more than 30K coins, he paid for a shit load more than 30K coins. He paid for security, and efficiency and he didn't cause a pump &amp; dump on an asset he wants to get deeper in.

Bubble-Like Prices makes sense, I have never seen growth like this in my entire life on an entity that has yet to actually do anything, though I am very young. I mean, is there a reason Bitcoin is ~$630 right now instead of ~$500, or ~$5000? It's highly speculative.
But Bitcoin not being sustainable might be a bit of a stretch. Sustainable means *able to maintained or upheld*. There is not a single reason why Bitcoin can not stay at the price it is. 
It isn't depleting resources and eventually running out, it isn't relying on a single individual who is coming close to the end, it isn't backed by some concrete entity that is gaining mistrust. It isn't the currecny of some empire that might soon meet it's end. Bitcoin is as 100% sustainable at the price it is as long as the world market doesn't collapse nor the WWW ceases to exist.

Your argument hinges on BTC price rising in some sort of Linear or Exponential form forever. This is completely untrue. There is only so much money BTC can be valued at and as more money goes into BTC, the price will rise at a slower pace. If all BTC is worth $1 (21 Million) and I put 21 Million dollars into BTC, each one doubled in price. But if each BTC is worth $10, and I put 21 Million Dollars in, then it is worth $11 each. Not doubling.
As More money goes into BTC, it's price will rise by less and less.
Deflation isn't some key to the rich life, it allows the currency to hold value and rise at a very slow and somewhat steady price. The reason the price is increasing at such a rapid pace now is due to adoption. But what happens when Adoption is over? 
New money going into BTC will be at a slower and slower pace and have a smaller and smaller effect on the price. 
Inflation doesn't drop the price to $0 over night and deflation doesn't shoot the price to Millions over night.
If you think there is going to be a time when the mainstream uses BTC AND you can wait 2 Months to get a TV twice the size of the one you can get today. You are kidding yourself. That is not how deflation works, otherwise you could say the same for Gold or Silver. Well can you? No you can not. 
Edit: Also if you think people will wait 2 Months for a bigger TV, then you are very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very wrong. Otherwise people wouldn't use things like Overnight shipping. Day 1 Orders. Everyone would just keep their money in Gold and live as frugally as possible.

Though I would like you to know that if BTC reaches 5K or 6K per BTC. At this point in time there will most definitely be insured and heavily regulated entities in the space who will be able to safely and securely process such a transaction. I'm not going to try to sell you on the:

Not this simple because you'll end up with a big ass number but it is basically this.
A simpler one might be:

From that number **SUBTRACT** Initial Investment. Then **SUBTRACT** Electricity Cost * Amount of time mining. 
Notice that the number you get at the beginning will continue to get smaller because the Network Hash Rate is a variable that seems to continue to increases dramatically.

Thank you for quoting words I did not say to express an opinion I do not have. +1
Why would I not like Capitalizing Economic Growth? Anyways "I know what that means", I did not understand what you were getting at.
You can say the same thing for Bitcoin. If everyone hoards Bitcoin then less are in circulation so their value goes up, its the same for Bitcoin that are lost. They are not in circulation so the supply will be lower and the price will go up. 
You are basically saying it is ok to hoard money, as long as it is not Bitcoin. This is a fallacy. If everyone had all their money in Bitcoin, then people will still need to buy food, people will still need to pay for gas, or want the newest cars, etc.. We see that with Overstock and TigerDirect and all these other businesses that accept Bitcoin and actually getting paid in Bitcoin.

I understand that this is a good idea and a great way to connect to one of the highly publicized people in BTC right now with the rest of the BTC community. But I don't think the CEO of Overstock has that much *more* knowledge about BTC than most of the people here. 
Though I am all for to this AMA. I just don't want anyone to ask him very complex questions about Bitcoin that he most like doesn't understand. Remember not it was him but his company's engineers who implemented the Bitcoin Features on the website and it wasn't his company but Coinbase (Was it Bitpay?) that handle the buying/selling of Bitcoins. 
EDIT: Horrible grammar, fixed some of it.

It's Freedom vs. Security, a lot of us want more freedom over our money than security by it.
We can scream for security now, but then we will complain. "Why do they need my ID and SSN to buy some bitcoins?" 
Then there will come processing fees. "Why does it cost me .05 BTC to buy 1 BTC or why does it cost me  $100 to sell my BTC" etc..
Then the government and the banks have records of your BTC wallets; "Oh we'll just tumble it or send them to other wallets." Clearly the government has the means to get inside these data centers and could probably be the ones tumbling the coins for you to entrap you in crimes that you didn't even commit. They'll be able to say;
"Well why did you send 5 BTC to this address that then send it to this address, that then sent it to this address that we believe is associated with XXXXX, are you a terrorist?"
Freedom isn't Security &amp; Freedom. Pick one or the other, if you want security then the BTC environment is not the right area for you right now. **You have to be secure with your own coins**. This has been stated everyday since the dawn of BTC, protect your coins, keep them off these unregulated exchanges and put them in coldstorage. You rarely see someone who has done coldstorage correctly complain about regulation.

GHash has shown that they think it is ok to have 51% whether they actually abuse it or not. This can and will cause a panic in the bitcoin community which will hinder it's growth.

Not necessarily. More expensive products might get priority shipping (This could be weeks or months, and with this ever increasing difficulty that is big money). The prices might not scale linearly with hashrate, if you dropped $20,000 you probably will get more than 5 Times the hash rash as if you dropped $4,000. Kind of like a combo buy 2 get 1 free. If you buy 1 you get 1, if you buy 2 you get 3.

Labcoin is a company that has stock denominated in bitcoin. It is not another currency. It is a company that plans to mine BTC and sell BTC mining hardware. 
@_date: 2013-08-22 22:51:17
I own shares in BTC denominated companies and I do slight Arbitrage in buying/selling BTC. More so in the owning shares than arbitrage. The rate of share price increase is extremely drastic over short periods of time. And there is not only money in investing in these companies but daytrading.
For Example. 
* Labcoin: Share price IPO'd at .001BTC (10cents), Sold 4 hours later at .0024BTC (24cents) It then went back down to a low of 13cents over the next week and last week some good news was released and it is back up at 23cents. (Now image buying thousands of shares of these). 
Stocks that had a wild increase in the last few weeks/months.
* [Ciphermine]( : If you would have invest in the IPO of this back in June and sold in July, you would have made 1000%  
* Asicminer**
* ActiveMining**
** Unfortunately Coinflow is having a problem accessing  's chart I am assuming as it will not pull up their share price/dividend chart.

This seems incorrect. It discourages investment? If my Bitcoin is worth $100 today and $200 in 4 months, and I invest it and gain a 10% increase. Then I made $120 in 4 months and not $100. Right? Then again just because something is deflationary doesn't mean the price skyrockets up. 
BTC could be worth $100 for the rest of the year, then $110 for the next year, and then $115 for the next year, then $117.5 for the next year and eventually be around $130 in like 5 years. It is deflationary. Why would this discourage me from investing?

You guys can downvote him all you want. But this is the price you pay. This is not me saying, "The government needs to be invovled." Fuck that. With more freedom comes less security and vice versa. There is minimal security in BTC denominated securities and a lot of freedom. Scammers happen to like that freedom. They thrive in it. You must be your own security. Research is not listening to what people say on the Bitcointalk.org forums, its going a step deeper to protect yourself and making sure you have made a sound investment.
In the regulated stock market, there is someone whose job is to protect you from scams such as this. In the BTC stock market, it is your job to do this. No one else can be blamed for not protecting you. (Yes Labcoin can be blamed for scamming though.)

If they continue to print money to buy BTC they will effectively be turning the american dollar into the Zimbabwe dollar. You can't just print off money and expect the dollar you printed before it to be worth just as much. 
Basically if they printed the US Dollar uncontrollably to buy up all the BTC, the price of BTC would skyrocket up and the price of the USD will plummet. Not just on the BTC/USD rate but on the USD/EU, USD/YEN, USD/APPLES. It would be catastrophic. Imagine someone making 40k a year and it now being worth 10k a year. Inflation of most severe kind.

Same here. I just decided to get my feet wet, and I've actually learned quite a bit since the day I've bought my first Bitcoin, I have a better understanding in investment, business practices, legal practices, etc.. Really take the time to read through the threads. If you see a company/fund you are interested, make sure to read their first post (page 1 first post); their business plan; the power of the shareholders; their contingency plan ( this is actually really important. 
* Satoshi Dice, went private recently and screwed over A lot of IPO investors, but recent investors made a killing ( I made quick return on this as I bought the shares the day before the announcement.)
Make sure to listening to the bad news people paste in the forums along with the good news. Now some people are trolling but its good to at least look at what they are saying.
**Important information:** Burnside is the current operator/founder of BTCT.co, so you use that site and he mentions something about a fund or something on that site, it is in your best interest to look at what he is saying. I personally only use Havelock and Burnside so MPEx and Bitfunder matter little to me, MPOE-PR is the PR person for MP (Which I think runs MPEx *Could be completely wrong*) but they are kind of a douchebag.

I personally use coinbase.com, you can buy and sell instantly, but the transaction to actually hold and use the USD/BTC takes awhile. So lets say I buy a BTC for $50, I might not get that BTC until 5 Days later when 1 BTC is worth $110, but I still only paid $50 for it. I haven't messed with Mt.

Keep your BTC **OFF MT.Gox**, especially since you seem to be a long time investor. There really is no benefit for keeping it there.
Since you are a longtime investor now; with a lot of money and investment in BTC, I ask that you please stay on top of the social opinion of BTC in your community from people in power. There might come a day when you wake up and BTC are illegal and you might be SOL (I would advise you keep it all on a cold storage and not on an online website; leave yourself in total control and even if BTC become illegal in your place of origin you can always move overseas later).

@_date: 2013-08-22 19:42:12
They do hold the coins. They always had the coins; they just match it to market value of the most reliable exchange. Coinbase doesn't buy the coins the moment you place your order. They have a storage of them. Another thing, their whole high risk thing is just completely random; there is no special reason you came out as high risk. Email them every/any time you get that high risk bullshit and they will honor the agreement. I am pretty sure the coins coinbase is selling you are coins they've had for quite a while and probably even got at the low point weeks ago. 
Out of all the businesses in BTC right now, coinbase is by far the most legit one. Any issue that has came up with coinbase so far has been resolved extremely professionally. I have yet to see coinbase fuck someone over intentionally. 
@_date: 2013-08-13 04:17:42
Oh, then yes. This is the route you should take to invest in BTC, Havelock and BTCT are very good, so is Bitfunder. The people who run the sites are very open and honest in the BTC community and if you use 2FA then your shares will be secure enough. I would do more than just buy a security and relax, I would read up on the progress and the operator of the share and public opinion of the company.

If you mean online-wise. The most reputable is Coinbase.com if you ask me. (Highly recommend the cold storage option) but Coinbase.com has had no issues security wise, they seem to be taking all the legal procedures and seem to be the most legitimate business that deals with the exchange of BTC/Fiat. One thing to mention though, they've only been operating for a few months ( I believe since like March ) but since I deal with BTC investing I own shares in companies that operate using Bitcoins and I just keep my unused coins on Coinbase for quick buying/selling instead of the cold storage option. I'm not sure if I would just leave 50k worth of bitcoins on there for a year or two untouched though. .

You an invest in an investment fund, if you are bullish and believe the price of BTC is headed up, then just sitting on them will give you a return.
Also Just-Dice.com is roughly a .5% return on investment gambling website. **You invest in the house, not gamble**: This can get you a .5% return on investment, but it can fluctuate a little if a huge gambler comes through and bets thousands of dollars worth of BTC.

Yeah its quite annoying. All this "It's my money I won't it now is fine." But maybe there should just be one major coinbase thread opened up every week. Where if you have an issue with the company you can post there. Actually I think this would be a good idea since Coinbase PR does browse to make sure they aren't fking someone over.

check out the [Securities]( section of Bitcointalk.org, its all about the different IPOs and Securities of the companies you regularly find on BTCT, Havelock, etc.. You'll even see the person running the company on there regularly conversing with shareholders, updating news, and you can find the contracts and business plans of the companies there.
I personally own some shares in Active Mining and S.MG(This one because I have no idea what S.MG is doing and I wished to take a risky click). Active Mining seems to be a hit or miss so I'm just hoping on the hit.

[This website]( Is where you will find Official forums from the companies for news/updates/new IPOs/Future plans along with discussion among current/prospective share holders. It is the center of the BTC Stock economy. 
I do not know of any single person who is a sort of News Economist who does reports on certain shares and their project growth or decline. I recommend you do the research yourself as there are a lot of scammers in the BTC community. Take everything anyone says with a grain of salt.
If someone recommends you buy a certain share, it is probably because they own it and want it's price to go up. They more so want to make money off you than help you make money. 
@_date: 2013-04-26 04:56:25
Bitcoin is more of Supply &amp; Demand currency than traditional centralized currency. You can't increase the amount. The supply will never increase after all the coins have been mined. Now what everyone who has invested in bitcoins is hopping is that the demand for the them will increase. Supply never changing and demand going up means that price will go up for each BTC. 
Now really everyone here is just hoping for demand to go up fast, now some people want it to go up faster than others (Some are still trying to rack up as much as possible while they are still "cheap") but overall, everyone here wants it to go up. Right now we can look at 1BTC as ~$140. But imagine in 10 years that demand keeps going up. We could be looking at 1BTC = $1000, or $10000 or even more (No one has a clue as to what BTC can cap at). But if we follow down the road to infinity and continue to use BTC, (With an increase in the number of people using BTC into the Millions, then Dozen Millions, then Hundred Millions, then the Billions). We could see BTC go up into $100,000 for one. 
Eventually people could say "Man I could live off of just 1BTC, if I could just get 1BTC". Instead of "Man I wish I had a million dollars, what I could do with a million dollars."

I just checked. Coinbase is definitely not the way to go. I'm sorry. If you were to sell coins right now you wouldn't get the money until Monday. But it seems to me like you make the transaction and then no matter whether you are buying or selling you get your USD/BTC on the following Monday. 
@_date: 2013-04-27 04:57:11
If you buy 2 BTC, I think they take those 2 BTC and take them from the seller and put them in reserve while they do the bank transaction for you. Both the seller and the buyer have transactions that they are waiting to be completed. If either fails then the transaction is cancelled and the seller gets the BTC back and coinbase doesn't take the money from the account. 
@_date: 2013-04-23 23:48:56
Yeah I would suggest Coinbase as that is what I use. I know it takes awhile to buy from Coinbase but I believe that it is much faster to sell on Coinbase and I see no reason why you shouldn't be able to sell them almost instantly. The problem arises in getting the money from Coinbase to your bank account which might take a couple days. The reason I say this is because when I bought coins off Coinbase it took quite awhile for the transaction to go through. While I bought to coins at $70 ea. I got the coins when they were $120 ea. a couple days later. I do believe it is free though, but I could be wrong.

Your "few hundred bitcoins" are worth something now. If you have atleast 100 * 100, thats $10,000, now that might not be a lot to you but that is something. As someone who has student loan debts I would gladly take your few hundred bitcoins. 
To answer "What does your gut say": I am optimistic about where Bitcoin's price can be in the next year, and it is the reason that I am turning fiat into Bitcoins and investing those Bitcoins to get my reserve up now. On the other hand, I know that this can all come crashing down. (I personally think we will break $200 again in December, February or March) and $130 in September or October).

I am one of the true advocates for coinbase on this subreddit and it pains me to see so many issues they have. I wish I could give you some insight on this but I only ever send to the first BTC address I ever got from them and it seems to work fine. I hope you situation gets resolved.

You have a bank account. Link the bank account to coinbase.com. Literally coinbase.com needs to be just glued to the sidebar because it is by far the best choice for people who are not technically savvy; don't want to put trust in other people. 
But yes. You should look up  they are a legit BTC/USD exchange. It is basically like an online BTC bank account. They have never been hacked and keep most of their coins in cold storage.

It's like going to a new planet full of volcanoes. The first couple years you're there you see anywhere from 0 to 50 Volcanoes go off a week, you can never tell what is going on, is there gonna be an eruption every couple of hours today or maybe 0 today and 10 tomorrow? Then comes a couple months back to back where you see anywhere between 5-10 eruptions a week. Now the planet is still volatile but not nearly as it was for the years before now. You can't say the planet is stable compared to other planets but the planet is stable compared to it's recent history.

The Higher end machines usually have a better chance and higher ROI. The more money you spend the more money you make. Spend 2K and hopefully make 3K if the company ships on time. Spend 40k and hopefully make 60-100k if the company ships on time. Atleast this is how it seems. 
@_date: 2013-04-24 18:30:18
Savings no, investment maybe. Don't keep your savings in something so Volatile, while a lot of us here believe that BTC's are going to keep rising (with minor and major drops here and there) we aren't putting our savings into it. Some of us are investing and holding and some of us are day trading. 
A lot of us also believe that a drop is coming something this week/weekend after a huge selling spike or some type of DDoS/hack that causes a massive influx of sales. I recommend two options:
DISCLAIMER: I am not reliable for any advice you take from this. These are just my humble opinions. 
1. Wait until and check prices until monday and check every couple hours for them to drop under $100, if they do watch them closely and see if you can get them under $80. You should be safe to make your money back buying under $100 and you should see good profit if you buy under $80.
2. Buy now (preferably under 140 or 130) and hold them. If the prices drop, DO NOT CASH OUT/IN (This is where all the horror stories are coming from, people paying 200+ and cashing out at that first bubble in April when they when back down into the 100s.) Hold, they will eventually rise back up (Hopefully, pretty much everyone on this subreddit has faith that they will quickly rebound after the next crash.). If you wish to bail out then, then bail out when it comes back around what you paid. Otherwise, just hold them, a lot of people here believe that BTC's could hit 300, 400, 500+ eventually and maybe into the thousands. (While thousands would probably be a year or more away if ever). 
I wish you the best of luck!

Cheaper entry. Less hassle. Less regulation. Much higher risk/reward. The thing about these companies stock prices are that they can be swayed by a single comment on bitcointalk.org. (Which happens fairly often, it is the reason Labcoin's price doubled recently). If you can wade through all of the bullshit post and really look at where the company is headed you can make a hefty profit.
* Asicminer has turned people into millionaires. (Success story)
* BTCST turned out to be a huge ponzi scheme. (Horror story)
I was planning on investing in real stock back in the spring. But tradeking has been playing games with allowing my account to actually buy/sell stock. 
You are right about you need money to make money. But compared to real stock, BTC denominated stock seems to have a much higher average increase than other real stock.
For example:
* The huge success story in the investment business right now is TSLA stock. Which went up around 400-500% over the course of the last 8+months.
* The huge success story in BTC right now are; Ciphermines 1000% increase though it has dropped back down quite a bit.
* Asicminers stock IPO'd at .1 BTC (August 2012? August 2012 BTC High was $15.4 for 1. So Asicminer's stock IPO'd at $1.5 for one). Right now 1 stock in Asicminer is worth over $300 with a high of around $500 if I am not mistaken (I would fact check this as I am not finding a second verification for the $15.4 high). 
* Activemining being up over double IPO price without producing any kind of hardware/tangible object yet.
* Satoshi-Dice buyout made me quite a bit of money.
* I've only been in BTC for a couple of months (Around May is when I got my first one). I have seen nothing but profits since. 
**BTW this [chart]( can show you realtime buying/selling of BTC@ on Mt.Gox.**
PS. I might have made errors in the above bullets, please fact check them.

Do you wish to invest **in** Bitcoin, or invest **with** Bitcoin?
I have found Coinbase.com to be the most efficient, easiest and one of the most trusted exchanges to use. (Quick information on how they work: If you are not Level 2 verified and buy BTC's from them, you will probably get them about 4 days after you buy them (Level 2 = Instant). Though you get the BTC's 4 days after you buy them you get them for the price that they were at when you decided to purchase them.
If you wish to invest **with** Bitcoins, I recommend Havelock Investments, they don't have nearly as many things you can invest on but they seem safer to me (you won't be scammed by people adding/or taking away 0's on options and stock prices). They also seem to reimburse/protect incase of a technological failure.

Yeah I understand that completely and I think they should stop. But the lesser of two evils is just having one thread where they can all gather around. I personally think they should wait for the support ticket to be responded too. They need to understand that Coinbase is a small start up and that it is experiencing growth pains. So far they have being doing an amazing job and these threads are not helping in the long run as they are painting a bad picture to an amazing (and probably one of the most trustworthy) companies in the BTC community.

As someone who doesn't mine. I know little about it. But I have been able to use BTC to turn a profit. There are people over at who read the Market of Bitcoin itself. Then there are the people over at who deal with securities in BTC. I do a little of both and it is a very profitable, highly risky field. Also the first do of Bitcoins. Visit bitcointalk.org, to me that is the central location of everything bitcoin. No matter the topic, it is somewhere on that website.

I think people might have the mindset. "Last time I was on the wrong side of the bust, this time I'm gonna make sure I'm on the right side, and sell a little earlier than max price." So around 200 the most frugal and cautious will start to bow out. IMHO

**Please understand: You are talking about Bitcoin mining**
* Bitcoin Mining is one aspect of the Bitcoin community and one of a few ways to gain more. 
* The reason many on here are obsessed with bitcoin; the very real reason why is because it is making them money. I'm not going to bullshit you about how it's giving the power of money back into my own hands or allows for near instantaneous transactions. **For Example**: In the last month, I worked for $12. Now I have made substantially more money  investing in BTC denominated companies and buying/selling Bitcoins than I have at work. (This is me making more money looking at a chart and playing Pokemon while I wait and do research than working a full time job for $12 over the summer). **To put it bluntly, it is paying for my school right now**
* Bitcoin Mining has entered a stage where it is basically for professionals only. I am saying this because you have to research the ROI for different equipment that can mine coins. You have to research power consumption and the cost of that power consumption. You have to research the company you are buying the equipment from; many of them are really screwing over their customers. And you have to research the net hashrate of the bitcoin community to make sure you will make ROI.
**Different ways to make BTC**
* Mine. Check out * Buy shares in companies. Check out * Arbitrage through buying/selling BTC. Check out * Gamble. Check out 
* Do odd jobs. Check out **Please check out bitcointalk.org for more indepth information on every subject listed above**

I'm all for BTC succeeding but it's a lot of the same rehashing over and over. "Here's why I think BTC will be $10000 one day." Then they go on about some new ideology they believe in now that they own something that made them some money. It's quite funny because they try to talk economics when they have no clue what they are saying.This other thread this guy was like "Why doesn't America just print a crap load of money and buy all the BTC so they can monopolize the market before everyone else" &lt;&lt; Really? 
99% Of the people on this subreddit need to just be honest to themselves, I'm in BTC for the money. To make money, to have money and pay off my student loans and not be tied down to some shit job I don't want to work. As long as the price of 1 BTC is more next week than it was this week I'll be happy whether BTC goes mainstream or not.

I don't do Arbitrage through fiat either lol. I would check out and the [Speculation]( ) forum on bitcointalk.org. I do purely stocks on BTCT.co and Havelock lol. 
Personally I'm willing to pay up to $100 per BTC (But I then put this BTC to work for me by investing it). A lot of the general BTC population feel comfortable with BTC at $100 so I believe it will be our return to price after a bearish market (a crash) and a Bullish market (a rise). I feel comfortable paying $100 for one because I believe that the price will continue to return to around $100 until the community grows some more.

Nope. I bought 3 for around $80 last week, got them last night for that same price while the price of the coin when up by around $50 each.

What do you mean? I buy on coinbase and send to a different wallet outside of coinbase. Any transactions I do are from that wallet, when it's time to cash back in to fiat I send from my wallet to coinbase and sell my bitcoins there where I am funded into my bank account.

Looking through this thread and all of the other ones I've seen (Even positive ones I've made) about coinbase. Reddit really has to be a gift and a curse for you guys. I mean the free marketing must be nice but it seems many here are quick to turn on you guys since money is involved. 
I hope you guys get some extra hands on deck soon! Good Luck, Love the Company!!

Saw your link on the Active Mining thread. Really like the pictures and agree with one of the people about the Blue symbol. It stands out in a negative way. Its bland, I'm not  an artist or graphic designer in any way but I really like the purplish/violet shade from the last picture in the bottom rhombus and make that the color of the BTC symbol.

I mean that if a country bans it the same away America stopped online Poker. If he keeps it in a cold storage and moves overseas he can then return it to fiat through a bank once more. So lets say he wants to pull out when BTC is $2000 for 1, and the country he is in no longer lets fiat/btc occur. He can always have that coldstorage and take that coldstorage across the border and make that fiat/btc switch there instead of trying to find someone who is going to buy 500 BTC at $2000 through something like localbitcoins.

Yeah people who started investing yesterday and lost money are the biggest "economist" and "financial experts" on this forum. Most of the people on this forum who I trust even a little, (which is low) I have tagged so I can remember who they are or where I've seen their posts before.

I've never heard them not honor the purchase; and I would recommend Lv2 verification. My purchases go through instantaneously. Did they not honor one of your purchases before?

Have you been in the subreddit when BTC crashes before? All you see are post like "Is this the end of Bitcoin?", "I lost so much money! I should of pulled out at $xxx", "Did anyone else fall for the crash?", Did you see the whole "Hold!!" phase that went on here? When it comes down to it. Money comes first in 99% of the people here's head. I think you might be the delusional one.

Exactly Coinbase is a multimillion dollar company if my memory serves me correctly, they aren't trying to scam people out of $50 here and $20 there.

Other options to make Bitcoin.
* Work for them. Do odd jobs.
* Invest, check out: Havelockinvestments.com, btct.co, bitfunder.com (I use BTCT &amp; Havelock)
* Arbitrage from fiat and BTC, sell high &amp; buy low.
* Gamble, there are quite a few sites out there that do all kinds of different ways of gambling. I believe some sites are even trying to do NFL betting, etc.. soon. Recommendation just-dice.com (I have no investment in this website at the moment).

Opps, both numbers were typos lol. I was sleepy when I wrote that and seeing as you are the one who runs the website you should correct my numbers. It looks like its .5% and not .05% as I previously thought. The .005% is just another typo. 
Ninja Edit: Um, "Over what period." Since the founding of the website?

Coinbase has never failed me. Just my two cents. 
@_date: 2013-08-05 02:01:39
There are a few I think might of missed:
*  - Bitcoin Stock Exchange
*  - Bitcoin Forums (way more information on here than on reddit)
Edit: fixed a link. Thanks to @_date: 2013-08-09 12:25:34
You're right. The thing is though, that if he scams you (And you are an investor, not a better, then technically he is scamming everyone who put money in the website. (If he fakes huge wins that cause investors to lose money)). He risks his reputation and a long term money maker for him.
Earlier this week he raised his management fee from 5% to 10% with  investors not caring at all. It seems he has a good set up; chill investors, good word of mouth marketing. I don't think he'll want to risk that. But you are right none the less.

Dude, go to btct.co, make an account. Go to Bitcointalk.org in the Economies &gt; Securities section, read up on the company, buy stock. Then you can day trade, long term invest, or w/e the fuck you want with them. Asking for advice on what stock to buy is stupid.

Just shoot them an email. That email is 100% automated and so is the program that checks for these high-risks. They are known to honor previous purchases.
