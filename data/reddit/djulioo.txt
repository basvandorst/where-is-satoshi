While in a lobby:
* Open up Resource Monitor on your PC (type "resmon" in command prompt or in Task Manager, click on Performance Tab &gt; "Open Resource Monitor")
* Find GTA5.exe
* Right click, select "Suspend process"
* Wait around 5 seconds
* Right click again, click "Resume process"
Now, when you tab back into the game, you'll see everyone "leaving" the lobby. Basically, what this does is, it makes the game "lag you out" into a private session, where you can do any activity and you're not limited like in an Invite-only session.
P.S. Eventually, people will be put in your session but it takes time before any appear. 
Have fun!

Ah, well I don't know of any way to do it but I'm sure there are possible things you can do. Search for "gta online ps4 solo public session" or something like that. Hope that helps
I guess I'll just leave the post, in case anyone on PC wants to do that. It's really helpful to not have to deal with hackers that explode you and stuff like that.
