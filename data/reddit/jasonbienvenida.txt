Dont use this service. You will get hit by 'hidden fees' 
why hidden? because you would not expect them and they are not written in a way you would ever realize they exist.
If you ever try to get in touch expect to get no solution to anyproblem along with horrible customer support.
I literally cant stress how bad of a company they are.

I am not talking about loss due to transfering bitcoin to and from the wallet. I am talking about "banking fees" that you claim are charged without ever mentioning them on your website.
Thats deceiving and its ridiculous cause you guys love pointing the finger back at the "bank" when at no point are we ever directly dealing with the bank.
As the accepting business you should take some responsibility for providing information or cautioning your users.
Use them if you want. But my advise stay away, dont let the recent fund raise fool you. Their business model is screwing people with "banking fees"

As a previous wirex user I would NOTT recommend using them unless you want to pay hidden fees, and high exchanges resulting in ridiculous losses.
Does the app work sure... but they will hit u every chance they get and you would never have expected it till your money is missing.
STAYYY AWAYY FROM WIREX
