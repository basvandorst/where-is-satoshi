That's not the point, you're clearly trying to get people to order via this page in a dishonest manner

Lol "I'm a nazi" fuck this kid

And with that you summarized the long term state of bitcoin

Tens if not hundreds of millions each year. DEA/Police isn't exactly known to be moral.
Imagine how easy it is, you kick in the door, find drugs, handcuff some guy, throw him in the car and find 100K USD in cash. It's in non-tracable bills. You and your partner takes 15K each

It seems you and reality have a long distance relationship, you should see her more often.
@_date: 2015-04-01 03:18:13
Since it was done without the authorization and knowledge of DEA, it's not really entrapment at all. It's just one crook fooling another crook.
If you go to your neighbour and stab his bedsheets with the intent to kill him, only to realize that he fooled you with a blowup doll, that still gets you charged with attempted murder/planned homicide.

I keep hearing this argument, but I don't believe it.
Let's take the instance of online gambling, just because it is a $50bn market !== that bitcoin would be worth 50 billion.

you support this lunatic on the basis that he plays the "I love bitcoin" card? lol

This idea that Warren Buffett knows tech companies better than someone (like myself) who is an electrical engineer and self-taught programmer is just ridiculous. Does he have expert advisors? Most likely, but if HE doesn't understand it himself, HE wont invest.
Do I believe I understand these companies MUCH better than him? Hell yea, do I have the capital to do something about it? Hell no.

You are ridiculously naive if you think Ross started Silkroad out of some "let's reduce the violence on the streets" ambition. This was pure profit mixed with ridiculous childish "Ayn Rand is a hero" philosophy.
99.9% of people purchasing drugs on Silkroad would not be the type of people who go to alley ways to buy drugs

So a fraudster and corrupt DEA agent being able to get away with it if he stuck to Bitcoin is somehow an argument FOR Bitcoin?
And you speak as if all of this drama is good, I'm glad you find it entertaining,but it's the sole reason Bitcoin hasn't been accepted yet and the reason the price of Bitcoin is so low.
I guess what I am trying to say is; grow up

It has been discussed a 1000 billion times. The reason it is generally dismissed is that it's way too easy to cheat it.
Strap this to a dog or strap 100 trackers to yourself an exercise 100x profit or just find a way to crack the device itself and give yourself infinite coins.
Plus this shit does not need the blockchain at all.

Ok give us a taste of this 45 min straight "logic and technical facts". Your post is 100% h0rse shit
@_date: 2015-03-18 15:18:10
This idea that Warren Buffett is without error is ridiculous. He has himself stated explicitly and repeatedly that the reason he does not invest in IT companies is that he in large part does not understand them and hence can't value them

Yes, because these projects are scams, just like Bitcoin is a evil drug magical money, right? The hypocrisy could collapse the metaverse

"Google will never catch up to Yahoo or Altavista"
"Apple will never catch up to Microsoft"
"Android will never catch up to Symbian"
If Bitcoin was as efficient and had even 1/10th of the power as these other platforms, I would agree that the network effect would be too great. But as of now on a technical side Bitcoin doesn't stand a chance. The utility is simple not there. It's like comparing a 90s cellphone to the smartphones of today.
@_date: 2015-02-24 12:14:38
That's a naive position.
Blockchain 2.0 projects like Nxt, Bitshares etc. is only a little over 1 year old.
The reaon Brian Armstrong is shitting his pants is that he knows the utility of these other platforms is 10000x fold that of Bitcoin. The only thing the 2.0 miss is massive amounts of users, but it's not like Bitcoin really got that many users either, for a global payment network it is barely out of the crib. So any one of these 2.0 platforms could realistically replace Bitcoin and hurt his business

"ripplers". I have never even touched Ripple.
Your post is h0rseshit and everyone can see it and has pointed it out: 
*"There I was with my brand new luminous fedora. Bitcoins future was at stake and only I, the mighty paleh0rse could change the course of history forever. So I jumped up and shouted nothing but technical facts and logic for 45 minutes straight. Everyone cheered. Confetti was tossed. Ripple was dead. Bitcoin was saved! As the dust settled I tipped my hat at some 8/10s and had drinks with the allies of my slain enemy"*
Your mom must not have loved you at all

This is close-minded at best. Warren doesn't "like" Bitcoin because he doesn't understand Bitcoin/care to understand it. If he understood it and saw the potential he would just buy up like 50% of the coins and hodl

No, it's not.
Quantum computing is already doing extremely important calculations. No one ever said QC would replace standard computation, in fact the contrary has been stated since Deutsch invented it.
@_date: 2015-02-23 21:33:52
It's downright disrespectful and digusting to see this sort of denial and lack of understanding.
Nxt, Bitshares, Ethereum, Counterparty, Ripple etc. all bring A LOT more to the table than Coinbase ever did. The innovation and new applications of the blockchain that was invented by the people behind these platforms is immense and mindblowing.
To have this corporate cunt talk down on these decentralized projects for his own personal millions of USD is just disgusting. And to see what used to be a great bitcoin community that wanted innovation and revolution, sit here licking his wrinkly nutsack is just depressing.
Satoshi is shaking his head at you losers

Vague statements? Name calling is fitting for someone who summarize years worth of work by tens if not hundreds of people as "distraction". When the same people are developing all the applications that sidechains dream of implementing into Bitcoin, which will be 100times harder than most people seem to think, not to mention it will centralize Bitcoin *a lot*.
Now I still hold a few hundred Bitcoin, but I am also invested in these other platforms, because as a business man and entrepreneur, I need the tech these great projects already give me. I cannot afford to wait another 2-3-4-5 years until a stable sidechain integrationis available or for the time it'll take for the private company creating sidechain to convince miners to let them implement it
