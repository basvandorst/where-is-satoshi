Launch is still end of Q3. Accumulation can be done on dips.

The question is mass adoption even important? Like you said Bitcoin has a better place as standard in the industry what it currently already does. When the world economy will grow towards blockchain/crypto then Bitcoin will stay an important part and will overtake gold and the Dollar. But this is a transition and won't happen overnight.
Bitcoin as payment system isn't a good option unless we create a much faster sidechain. But a sidechain on top of Bitcoin could also have another name instead of bitcoin since it won't be real bitcoin. A payment curreny backed by Bitcoin would be a better idea which is easier for mainstream.

It doesn't matter. Do you want to own your money? Or do you want to get robbed? If you want to get robbed just put your money by a 3rd party. But don't cry when they run or go bankrupt or something else.

It's not difficulty. It's the most stable software at least on Linux systems. You will get warnings when you have to update. Sometimes it's needed but you can also run older version.
You can run other things alongside if you have enough ram and cores.

You are disgusting. Taxes are a crime. If you support taxes you are a criminal supporting funding of wars. Murder of children and helpless people. If you don't understand this you should get some education about the banking system.

Shouldn't be done by taxes. Taxes are a crime and that's a fact. Governments steal money from their citizens. Instead the system should be we pay and we receive a service for that. This should be freely. If not you can't use their service. If you really believe in democracy, you must be pretty dumb. We don't live that way. But I get it, you are not educated enough on this subject.

XRP is popular because lots of people are stuck in it with their investment. So they will do marketing to get people into XRP so that they can leave. Like a ponzi.
But to be real XRP is trash and not really crypto. This was known years before. And mostly really dumb money and children hold XRP. It's sad.
Tether is just USD

Lets say it this way: You are earlier going to die than Bitcoin will become worthless.
With that said, everything in life there are negative sides and risks. But if you take no risk you could be better dead and it is indeed the same as being dead.
Also it is how you see Bitcoin. Most see it as an investment. Which is wrong because where do you invest your fiat into exactly? Without proper banking knowledge and knowledge how bitcoin works one shouldn't judge it.

First question is: Which country do you life? In the Netherlands there are multiple OTC desks. Where no KYC is needed nor a minimal age.
You could try this:  [ 
It's from the Netherlands. But I am not sure if you could buy there if you life in America. But they allow credit cards. And other payment options.

Really good point. It should be a secret that you even own Bitcoin. If you have a lot and the price reaches high prices in USD which it will cause inflation. Then your life can become at risk. And I think many Bitcoin holders will die in the future because other people will want to rob them or even make the Bitcoin unusable because then it will become even more worth.
Bitcoin is a risky asset not because it's volatile but because it's the most scarce asset on earth and sooner or later Bitcoin is wanted by everyone including governments. People who called it a scam are crying to get it.
And yes normal folks will use coinbase and give it to 3rd parties. But if you're smart and defend yourself, you do it on your own.
Second thread is the government if you use a 3rd party. What if a government bans Bitcoin.  3rd parties can't defend themselves against this. So governments can seize 3rd parties and you lose everything. Like they did with gold. Banned it and murdered everyone who hold it and they got the gold.

I see many people here are noobs regarding to trading. So it might be a better choice to ask this question in a trading community and not specific Bitcoin.
Bitcoin is btw a really fast moving market. So trying to trade on other markets first might be better. But the faster a market moves the more risk involved and it's a 24/7 market which makes it extra difficulty

You can get into trading. Which is a great idea. But I highly deeply suggest you to trade a demo account for 1 year at least first. Recognizing patterns, **risk management**, trying strategies and making your own. Experience is the most important but don't think you can get rich quickly that's what everyone thinks and almost everyone loses due high leverage and irresponsible behavior due emotions.
Never trade based on emotions or trying to earn back lost money. Keep learning. It won't be easy and it could be boring. You have to love trading on it's own. But if you start early you have plenty of time to gain experience.
First demo (1Y) -&gt; Low balance account -&gt; then you can upgrade but be responsible I suggest to do this at a later age when you are over 20 because you will be more responsible then because you see more risk. This is also the reason brokers have a minimal age for trading.
