With the number of scams involving bitcoin, you have to be very cynical.
Explain how you're making money / how you're legitimate.
Don't say out of the goodness of your heart.
I don't

From their website:








At best, you're buying a $2 watch from China. At worst, this is an outright scam or money laundering scheme.








Yeah, no.

... yes it does?
The transaction fee is the incentive to include the transaction in a block. Higher transaction fee, more incentive. Lower transaction fee, lower incentive. Since space is limited, miners logically choose the higher incentive transactions first.

Citation? I am aware of what it is, but how have you concluded that it is more secure?

They confiscated bitcoin's servers.

This would be a great demonstration / article. Give some type of 'secure storage' to somebody that is experienced with breaking into things. See how an experienced attacker would attempt an attack and see how successful those attacks would be.
Would anybody be interested in doing something like this?

You haven't given any specific reasons why hardware wallets are not secure.
The sticker on the Trezor boxes are not a strong security device. However, security doesn't depend on that sticker. Say an attacker gets by it and loads malware on the Trezor. You can (and probably want to) just flash the firmware on the Trezor when you get it. The strength of the sticker is weak, but also not critical.
Backdoors could happen and are definitely a threat. Open source software can solve this. 
Also, exchanges and bitcoin banks are just as vulnerable to these attacks. Plus, they're vulnerable to much much more, and generally store much larger amounts, making them bigger targets.
Nothing is perfect. Security is about minimizing risks. Hardware wallets and exchanges/banks are definitely vulnerable to attack. But which is *more* vulnerable to attack? Where are you realistically going to store your money?

Keep it in Bitcoin (certainly tumble it through alts or a tumbler) and just cash out 1k/month to live on or figure out a good way to launder it. (I'm sure you could find people willing to help)
Putting hundreds of thousands of dollars in your Coinbase account / bank account (both linked to your personal identity) raises all kind of red flags.

From the article, it sounds like they weren't very technical. The exploit used might have been very basic. I would love to read the official court document to see how they did it and how the feds traced it.

I did, but I was responding to someone who suggested that a merchant using a POS would possibly require more than one confirmation.

It's not proof, it's just evidence.
That plus the 10 other things linking Vaulin to KAT makes the link stronger.

When would a vendor/merchant ever require more than zero confirmations in a POS scenario?


I'm curious how this would work.
