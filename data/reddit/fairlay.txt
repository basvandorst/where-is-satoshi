What do you think?
@_date: 2014-02-09 03:28:22
This are the rules for our beta starting in the next days. We offer 600 mBTC: 
@_date: 2014-03-31 14:44:49
I am pretty sure we don't know the hole story yet, market thinks there is a &gt;75% chance that they will "find" at least 50,000 more BTC
@_date: 2014-05-19 08:41:50
here we go: 
@_date: 2014-05-16 23:14:45
thanks - done.
@_date: 2014-02-09 06:30:07
sorry - its not online yet - we did not ask anyone to put money into it - but nevertheless, you are right. We have to review all texts.
@_date: 2014-01-25 20:59:09
sport is covered by other sites I guess... (even with BTC)
we will not do bets on death but any thing else is fine
incarceration (maybe)
e-sports betting (!)
politics (maybe) hard to define a clear bet that can be resolved clear
altcoins (!)
Poker? Not our business but there are already bitcoin-only poker sites...
@_date: 2014-05-09 15:05:44
Ok - the colors are one thing - but what is more intuitive to you - odds (what you get back on on unit if you predict right) or percentages (likelihood of the event based on the prediction)
@_date: 2014-02-25 17:36:07
This is our beta - you can only bet with credits - but after the beta real BTC bets/predictions will be possible.
@_date: 2014-03-29 02:15:27
Will 50 be reached? 
@_date: 2014-01-27 02:50:31
launchrock ist only a cloud tool for pre-signups. The betting market will not be hosted in the US.

thats part of the game...

@_date: 2014-01-25 12:13:40
What other kinds of bets should we offer?
@_date: 2014-06-23 17:42:59
well, fairlay is the account of the company with four people having access - koeppelmann is a account from Martin Koeppelmann (Co-founder) and coinanalytics does some analysis for us but is not directly an employee.
Thus you are right, all 3 accounts are connected to fairlay but we still think it is legit to post from different perspectives.
@_date: 2014-02-18 02:48:36
we are building such a site.
But we are still in Beta, so you only can earn "credits" right now, sorry.
@_date: 2014-02-07 01:46:37
done! At least we start with two bets on our facebook likes: 
@_date: 2014-02-09 04:53:38
What do you mean? The website is not online yet.
@_date: 2014-02-16 03:34:09
@_date: 2014-07-17 00:06:19
will BFL be out of business by the end of the year: chance is about 10%:
@_date: 2014-04-01 14:08:20
good to know - that must mean something is incorrect
@_date: 2014-07-08 18:50:57
we offer predictions on BFL. For example will they be in business by the end of the year, and "will the monarch make any profit".
The numbers suggest you are right since the chances that the monarch will make profit are less then 1% according to the predictions of our user:
@_date: 2014-06-06 00:52:52
?! Ok, I can understand the decision to say this is Off topic but I can really not understand why this is not: 
I posted the same news before this - mine gets deleted a off topic, the other gets 250 votes...
@_date: 2014-02-09 06:34:07
In the beginning we have to do this. But we already thought about ways to find a voting consensus - or have trusted third persons as judges.
And we will do bets with a verifiable outcome like: will a certain BTC address receive X-coins.
@_date: 2014-05-06 01:37:10
We would love to use it for our PM: fairlay.com
Even if we are a centralized PM right now we believe in a decentralized future. More in our comment on Bitcointalk:
@_date: 2014-03-31 15:15:57
well - not sure yet, but here you can predict wether he will write us a message: 
@_date: 2014-01-30 00:34:00
More suggestions for bets?
@_date: 2014-06-23 20:54:33
if you bet 1BTC as the first person you can choose your odds. Lets say the event is not very likely and you choose 4. Then we try to find a match for your bet. You bet 1 BTC and want to bet back 4 (thus winning 3) The direct match would be another person betting 3 BTC with odds of 1.333 (he would win 3*1.3333 = 4BTC) He wins your 1BTC. Of course we also match parts of the sum. (If someone bets 1.5 BTC at 1.3333 than 0.5 of initial 1BTC are matched.
As long as a prediction is open you always can cancel it.
In the end you always get at least the odds you requested or you money back if no one is willing to accept this odds.
@_date: 2014-02-19 17:21:53
nice! - do you have a link for more details of this story?
@_date: 2014-05-14 16:39:55
thanks, could you plz add a comment why you think your prediction is going to happen?
@_date: 2014-02-07 01:47:49
done - we have a couple of price bets
@_date: 2014-02-09 16:10:02
not in general - but yes, we need to face issues and we can not promise to allow US customers after the beta. For the beta where you bet with free credits and only some are rewarded with BTC as a price: everyone is welcomed!
@_date: 2014-06-18 06:20:22
maybe the fee is even higher if they sell it above market price - that is exactly what users of our prediction marktet expect:

@_date: 2014-02-09 16:06:44
Good question! Basically the betting system is different. At fairlay.com you bet at your own odds and you just need to find someone (we will do that for you) how want's to bet against you at this odds. With the other betting System, called " you do not know at the time of the bet what you will win because it depends on what players do after you. 
It is liking buying Bitcoin on an exchange compared to preordering a miner to get Bitcoins. When you preorder the miner there are a lot of factors not in your hand that determines how much you will get in the end.
Both might be fine - our recommendation is to know what you will get!
If anyone how already knows what the difference is - and with better english skills - will describe the both systems in a short article with advantages and disadvantages: PM us, we pay $15 in Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-01-25 20:55:03
yes - we will do e-sports!
@_date: 2014-02-09 15:55:51
go for it! It is a free market - if anyone is willing to bet against you we will not interfere
@_date: 2014-01-25 13:29:05
we will offer exactly this! Starting our beta in 10 days.
@_date: 2014-06-27 22:02:18
thanks, done
@_date: 2014-06-23 20:35:27
yes - you are right - if you think yes is 33% than it can still make sense to bet on yes if your odds are bigger than 3. Have a look at the "advanced form". There you have a slider to choose the likelihood you think the event has and it shows you if someone is willing to bet against you for this odds. (If the slider is in the red zone you could bet on "no" in green "yes") If it is in the white zone the market has the same opinion as you and thus no now will bet against you.
We know that it is not easy to understand und we will definitive make further UI improvements, however - thanks for your feedback - it is really helpful to hear at what point people get stuck.
@_date: 2014-06-27 16:03:12
Hey - thanks for you interest - you are right - we are still at the very beginning and some predictions have miniscule volumes. Still - we would be happy if you would give it a try. On this one at least 1,495.70 mBTC are waiting to get matched: 
@_date: 2014-02-09 03:44:20
we really planned to go online on the 4th but then decided to improve the site - my best guess is that we start on Monday but it is more important to us that we are happy with the page then to make the announced date.
but thanks for the reminder - I just updated the mail an the sharing page to "mid Feb" ;)

done: 
@_date: 2014-06-26 02:23:29
sure - it is cool for the bet creator - but we just take way less fees. And just compare the odds: for example the worldcup: 
If you bet 0.01 on Germany you get 0.0242 back.  If you bet the same amount on fairlay you get 0.04 back. That difference is HUGE. Betting on Brazil is even worse on betmoose.
In addition the odds at fairlay are guaranteed - at betmoose they will very likely become worse if the event is more likely to happen.
However - we like competition - and we admit they have done a good job building the site. Still we think that our betting system is way more favorable for users than the parimutuel betting system of betmoose, bitbet and many mores.

what do you mean? The current MtGox predictions consider the current "status" of MtGox?

@_date: 2014-05-18 22:22:25
ok - done - really good comment by the way..
@_date: 2014-05-13 18:33:56
thanks - we will do - but can you add the comment on fairlay?
 &gt; Write a comment on fairlay why you think your prediction will come true
@_date: 2014-06-23 15:08:32
hey - first, thanks for the explanation - that is exactly right. Regarding the user interface: our first focus is to have a convenient interface - the legal aspect is a different one. We switched to % because we thought that is more interesting for people to directly see what chances for a certain event are. In the next step it is more interesting to know what you will get back when you predict on it - that is why it is odds in the prediction form. In the advanced form we show both so that the user can really understand what is going on.
We are still trying to figure out what the best solution is: 
What do you think, what solution would you prefer?
@_date: 2014-07-19 18:06:59
thanks - (just found this comment) - sadly hour posts get downvoted away by betmoose, compare:

Why we need a working PREDICTION MARKET!
- information should have a price, but a fair one
Information is worth pure money. At this moment, thousands of Bitcoins on Mt Gox are traded for around 70% of their value. Consequently, right now the information whether Gox is short in Bitcoin or not is worth **millions of dollars** - if you were to know "Gox will allow withdrawals in 2 weeks again” you would sit on a gold mine. We from fairly believe that reliable **information should have a price - but a fair one**. The best way to decide upon a fair price for a certain good is to let it be traded in a free market. This is the idea of a prediction market.
How does it work?
A working prediction market should aggregate all data into the best available forecast. If you have newer or better information you can always bet against the current prediction, improving the forecast and get rewarded in the process. The key performance indicator will be the spread between betting on an event and betting against an event. Sports betting sites are traditional bookmakers and make money through this spread. You bet against the house and not against other users. If you bet on both outcomes equally you will get a return of 70% - 90% of your wager. **A prediction market needs &gt; 98% return**. This also means that the odds on a certain event can change over time when new information becomes available, akin to the price of shares in a stock market. A prediction market lets you sell your earlier predictions at a profit before the event has even taken place.
Other features a prediction market should have are:
* anonymous betting
* a transparent process of resolving a bet - optimally decentralized or at least with a provable track record  
* funds protected with a transparent multi-sign no-trust-needed solution
* open access to all bet data
* get push notification on price changes (be warned if new information is out)
We can **not offer such a market today** but this is our **vision** of where we want to go and we have taken the first little steps to get there. We can not offer the decentralized aspects today - not even in the next month - but we are working on it! We have the basic functionalities of a prediction market implemented and will commence a beta testing phase very shortly. You can pre-register on

thanks for the feedback on uservoice. You definitely found a bug - we will look into it. It is only a wrong calculation on the profile overview page - canceled bets are not handled properly.
I just send you another 10mBTC. We are not sure if we should continue with this promo since the response was not very good (13/to 9 votes) - but if we do a new post you are welcome to particapate again. But I would like to close this one since we got no attention here any more and obviously our main goal was to increase the visibility of fairlay :)

the market thinks there is a decent chance that at least 50,000 of them will be "found" by MtGox:

typical double posting problem, should be solved by "proof of up-vote"
@_date: 2014-06-05 12:40:03
because it shows more clear than ever that traditional fiat money does not have the ability to hold value. Banks not have to pay a fee (negative interest rate) to store money a the central bank.

hm... yes, why not, I can do a tip instead of a normal transaction at the same conditions. Just need to load my tipping account...
@_date: 2014-03-27 01:55:31
they will probably "find" some more BTC...

True - but in this case hedging would have the opposite effect - since more people would bet on "no".

indeed: 
We even used to have an prediction on the winner of the One Drop (Big One) Event during the WSOP...
@_date: 2014-07-18 05:19:56
we offer a prediction soon that will show wether or not the problem is solved: 
@_date: 2014-03-28 23:31:26
that is very true and at the same time the reason for our comment :)
@_date: 2014-06-17 17:18:53
Sorry - it is just a unlucky combination of team members traveling, being ill, a broken power charger and our high security standards that does not allow it to resolve a event from a random PC. The resolution of the Germany game will probably take another more hours...
And thanks for the domain name reminder...
@_date: 2014-06-10 08:52:06
ok, thanks for clearification
@_date: 2014-03-21 22:13:59
here you can bet if they maybe "find" 50,000 more BTC: 
@_date: 2014-09-23 21:24:20
actually the site is still online and is still taking orders - at least for the Jalapenos
@_date: 2014-03-23 19:39:55
Will Cryptsy be the next:  They had a significant bug 4 month ago as well:  when someone managed to cash out 60 BTC more than he had. 
@_date: 2014-02-15 20:14:25
What do you think? - happy about every feedback!
@_date: 2014-06-23 03:38:33
yes - bitcoinwisdom normally does the best job. We compared different predictions from different sites for a few weeks - have a look at the results: 
Also: We are trying to be a good source for mid term prediction like: "what is the difficulty in 3 month":

What would you like to bet on?
@_date: 2014-07-17 19:50:23
obv. we could code something on our own to resolve that event - but we would only do that if there is big interest in this event. Otherwise we better put the time in our site...
@_date: 2014-05-01 00:05:45
They are simply wasting money by not allowing people to bid.
@_date: 2014-05-08 23:02:01
hm... we are even thinking to change to bits. (1000bits = 1mBTC)
So you would prefer 0.01BTC instead of 10mBTC?
@_date: 2014-06-04 16:43:55
Just added our company fairlay.com - the Bitcoin prediction market. As a Bitcoin only site with a team on 3 continents Bitcoin is a "no-brainer"

@_date: 2014-09-03 22:33:51
Thank you iCloud.
@_date: 2014-07-18 01:53:41
what is wrong about it? It would be awkward if we would already have accepted the event. But we did not yet. It is a event proposed by a user. No one can expect from us that we always no directly a solution to every proposal. However, what you can expect is that we only accept events if we are sure how to resolve them.
In this case we know in theory how to do it but we don't know a convenient way - so what is wrong about asking r/Bitcoin? 
@_date: 2014-06-23 21:07:23
sure - the percentages we show are basically the open odds that others are right now willing to give you.
Lets say there is a coin flip event. The chances are obvious 50:50 and the odds should be 2 for both sites to be fair. On our site people would like to get higher odds then two. Thus one would try to place a prediction at lets say 45% on both sites. (that is odds of 2.2222). The coresponding odds are 1.818 or 55%. In this case we would display 55% for both sites.
Another way to think of it is the spread between buy and sell. Obviously the highes buy offer is always lower on a market then the lowest sell offer. The higher the spread is the bigger the sum is &gt;100%. Thus you should look out for bets that sum up close to 100% or at least be careful to choose good odds to make a prediction with a good chance to profit.
@_date: 2014-09-18 20:45:47
basically that is why we started fairlay.com - it is a very similar concept to bitbet but the betting system is different. Unlike to bitbet your payouts can not get worse over time. Instead you place a prediction that is bound to odds (your payout) and if someone is willing to match this bet it becomes active. Of course you can also take the odds someone else is already offering - then the bet will become active immediately
@_date: 2014-04-16 16:24:09
In the near future we will focus on events predicting the difficulty. Will the exponential growth of the hash rate continue? That would mean a 250B difficulty around christmas. A liquid market on bets on this topic would give a goods prediction on the future difficulty that would help people making the right decision wether to buy or not to buy a miner. Miners on the other hand would have the option to hedge against exploding difficulty by betting on it.
@_date: 2014-05-05 20:16:29
is any site using it already? I have not looked into it in detail yet - but it could be very interesting our site: fairlay.com (Bitcoin prediction market)
It would simplify the sign-up process and would give us at the same time the information to witch address the user would withdraw his winnings.  
@_date: 2014-02-09 05:52:46
outch - fixed - at least the 404

will 50 BTC be reached? 
@_date: 2014-06-27 21:34:26
that would be awesome!
@_date: 2014-03-22 14:44:50
Here you can bet whether or not the price will fall below €400 on kraken: 
@_date: 2014-03-23 13:06:48
probably this is why the market thinks there is a decent chance that MtGox will "find" 50,000 more BTC pretty soon... 
@_date: 2014-02-18 03:30:07
Well, the top 21 user with the most "credits" will be rewarded with 600mBTC in total. But that is not what you are looking for. It is really just a promotion to attract some test user.
@_date: 2014-03-24 03:14:38
Crytsy next?
Or will it be BTC-e?
Market says crypts is more likely...
@_date: 2014-06-27 22:21:15
sure - and I enjoy having the possibility with reasonable transaction fees.

Market thinks there is about a 7% chance that they will implement it soon. But maybe this is wishful thinking driven price:

we add Olympia

hm... thats not good :( Have you looked in the spam folder?

If you want a site where you can "use" or try out test net coins visit our test version at: 
You can deposit test net coins, bet with them and withdraw them again.

you can place a prediction on that here: 
@_date: 2014-06-14 22:37:01
Yes - that is the way we want to go. However, we only want to add more events parallel to user growth since nothing is more boring as lots of events with no predictions on it.
But if you have a concrete suggestion: you can use the "new event" form
@_date: 2014-02-19 19:08:24


However, there are real advantages: The prediction market (that resolves the bet) is kind of an escrow service. And it is much easier for other with the same interest to increase the bounty, by just putting more money on "no". The other way round speculators could bet on "yes" even if they can not full fill the requested "task" on there own but they can help. Concrete example in this case: you could have taken the risk to bet on "yes" without the intention to do real marketing but at least you can help with your "like" and a "share".

not exactly the datum we are looking but at least the number of multi.sig transactions - thanks
@_date: 2014-02-15 19:51:50
read what we are trying to build:
@_date: 2014-02-19 19:09:42
@_date: 2014-01-25 13:24:26
What other kinds of bets should we offer?
@_date: 2014-06-17 19:12:28
we do a compromise - small amounts are done automatically - but for security reasons larger transactions are manually signed on a offline PC and then only the transaction is spreaded. However, we try to speed-up this process as well. (or at least make it more transparent to give the user at least the feedback that something IS HAPPENING ))
@_date: 2014-06-26 20:32:14
at fairlay.com you can choose the odds as well and in all predictions that are offered on both sites the spread on fairlay is way lower and thus the offered odds.
The reason is that we only start bets if we now that there are people willing to be a market maker.
However, we admit that Predictious are a decent site as well.
@_date: 2014-02-19 19:00:09
you find the article?
@_date: 2014-02-16 19:29:00
Good question! Basically the betting system is different. At fairlay.com you bet at your own odds and you just need to find someone (we will do that for you) how want's to bet against you at this odds. With the other betting System, called " you do not know at the time of the bet what you will win because it depends on what players do after you. It is liking buying Bitcoin on an exchange compared to preordering a miner to get Bitcoins. When you preorder the miner there are a lot of factors not in your hand that determines how much you will get in the end. Both might be fine - our recommendation is to know what you will get!
If anyone how already knows what the difference is - and with better english skills - will describe the both systems in a short article with advantages and disadvantages: PM us, we pay $15 in Bitcoin.

thanks, I send 10mBTC anyways, sorry for the long response time... 
@_date: 2014-06-25 22:43:12
what features do you miss? Right now the odds on our site are way better, just compare!
@_date: 2014-05-14 16:10:34
if you want you can claim here 10mBTC more for today:  
@_date: 2014-03-31 16:05:25
ok, sorry, we try to write it only at points in the discussion where it makes sense and thus it is hopefully not spamming, but you are right, today it was to much... we stop 
@_date: 2014-07-19 18:04:00
at least we are not the only one believing you use sock puppet accounts.
And just to cite you: "there are SO many troll threads around "price to be $X?" based on absolutely nothing, but when I put down 0.5 BTC on it, it's considered spam???" 
So you are saying it is interesting to see what people are willing to predict on. Now we provided graphs where the predictions are converted to percentage to the see the likelihood of events. Now you say: "I still don't get why it's interesting since its just a bunch of graphs out of context. Stop spamming reddit."
There are two option: 1. your are not very smart. 2. you are dishonest.
If you would create this event on betmoose I promise I would place a prediction...
@_date: 2014-06-26 15:07:20
yes - we are right now programming that
@_date: 2014-07-09 18:21:54
yes - that is more or less the way to go - but we hope someone wrote a script for this already summing up all amounts on this addresses to get the number we are looking for.
@_date: 2014-06-12 23:16:43
ok, here we go: 
@_date: 2014-02-16 01:41:25
Yes we posted the same link but deleted it, because we did not want to annoy people coming to our page and signup is not working. Now we fixed the signup and we posted the link again. Really don't want to spam.
@_date: 2014-06-24 03:50:45
we are just working on that order book - you find the latest predictions here: fairlay.com/predict/latest Btw: we have a test server running on " Here you can try everything with free test net coin (you get them here: 
@_date: 2014-06-26 15:12:02
on our site you have "open" odds and "covered" odds. The "covered" ones that I cited are actually already placed by another person and are waiting to be matched. The "open" ones creates a new offer (that is why they are better) and you can not be sure that anyone will match them. You can cancel them any time (since they are matched) if things change and you are not longer happy with it.
It is basically like placing a buy/sell order at an exchange. You could choose the current market price to get you order executed immediately our you can choose your own price and hop someone will take it.
The big difference to the  is that here your odds will likely get worse if your bet becomes more likely since more people are betting on it.
On our site you always get at least the odds you choose.

ok, sorry - right now there is a redirect to this sign up page. This is hosted on a different server since it is a service of "launchrock". Our SSL certificate is for our server. When we are only with the real site this won't happen

On every Bitcoin related page I see tons of advertisement for unprofitable miners. Ok - lets do an estimate how much they spent:
In the next year from now every 10 minutes are 25 BTC generated. That is 6*25 a hour - 6*25*24 a day and 6*25*24*356 the next year roughly 1.3 Million BTC ≈ $500,000,000. Thus probably miners are sold for at least halve of it 250,000,000. If they spend 5% on advertisement that is: $12,500,000.

Your search - site:xhamster.com bitcoin - did not match any documents.

done - bets on Nxt and Doge to get started
@_date: 2014-02-16 01:37:26
What do you think? We want your feedback!
@_date: 2014-01-27 03:11:51
might be hard to determine a winning outcome for events with controversial news coverage
@_date: 2014-06-23 17:45:58
Maybe you are right and we are a little bit more complicated - but it is worth it. The parimutuel betting system of betmoose and bitbet has a much higher danger in making a really bad betting decision since your odds can change to you disadvantage afterwards.
@_date: 2014-02-16 03:27:19
promise - we change it.
@_date: 2014-05-14 16:15:11
thanks, make sure to write a comment here: 
Also make sure that your bet is fully matched.
However, I have sent you the 10mBTC anyways:  
And if you want you can claim here 10mBTC more for another bet (on an other event): 
@_date: 2014-02-09 15:54:31
thanks - we will keep that in mind
@_date: 2014-04-30 23:09:01
Thanks - we will do that. But it seems to be difficult to find an open spot for promotion. Since there is no bidding system you have to be the first and you can only buy slots 3 month in advance - thats not a good timeframe for a start up.
@_date: 2014-02-07 03:11:43
sorry, our first starting date was the Feb 4. But we decided to redesign our betting forms to make it more straight and simple. Can promise but the Feb 10. is what I would bet on right now.
@_date: 2014-01-25 12:43:09
nice one! We will include that!
@_date: 2014-03-20 16:25:18
Good idea but this graphical representation is not really useful
@_date: 2014-07-02 19:19:19
10,000 transactions. Or you are paying to much fees..

market thinks there is a 5% probability that BTC-e will halt Bitcoin withdraw for more then one week in the next month: 
@_date: 2014-02-13 15:43:03
yes - thats right - we need to define the rules for the resolution more clearly
@_date: 2013-12-09 06:08:28
soon there will be a better option: 
The Bitcoin-betting market
@_date: 2013-10-16 13:41:19
Was it money you payed into MtGox or was it money from selling BTC? Before this last withdrawal from a sell I could withdrawal money I send to Gox month before as well in a few days.
@_date: 2013-10-16 12:57:07
First I am just informing about current processing times and second there is obviously the risk involved Gox does not pay off at all.
