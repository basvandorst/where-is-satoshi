They already don’t. That’s why Facebook sucks now.

Average r/bitcoin post:
“Hey guys I made some cool icons for everyone to use! Hopefully it helps ease of adoption for various businesses :)”
Average r/btc post:
“r/bitcoin is a group of ZEALOUS, VIOLENT, SOCIALISTS. Please visit our king Roger Ver’s personal website for more details”

It's not bitcoin but a cash symbol that matches the theme. For instance, if you were programming a way for people to buy btc with usd, you could use that icon next to the usd field.

That's a fair question, no shame!
Breadwallet provides a means to access your wallet directly using a passphrase of randomly generated words. This means that even if breadwallet is gone forever, you can still use other apps to access your bitcoin. 
Coinbase, on the other hand, essentially says "we promise that you have access to x bitcoins". You don't have access to the private keys, and thus if coinbase stops existing for any reason, you lose that money until a lawsuit etc gets it back (which is NOT guaranteed to even happen).

Mining power is what allows the bitcoin network to function. In effect, people contribute computer powe which approves bitcoin transactions. For their work in doing this, miners have a chance to receive newly generated bitcoins.
In order for anyone to make a change to the bitcoin "code", they must control a huge majority of this mining power (like &gt;85%) this includes the creator, satoshi nakamoto, who may or may not even be a real person. Getting this amount of computer power is extremely expensive, even a large government would have to put a large portion of their income towards it. This makes it unlikely any one group can affect the rest of the core of the bitcoin network on their own. 
Keep in mind this is a very loose description. There are many resources that describe in it greater detail.

You could have posted a constructive post explaining the benefits and risks of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general, but you memed instead of contributing constructively. Well deserved.

Market manipulation is a different beast. Like any market, a majority holder can affect the price to a much greater extent than smaller holders. The hope is that, with enough people using bitcoin, the effects of these market manipulations are diminished.

Posting the fact that you have about $150k in bitcoin  online is a very poor choice. Don't make yourself a target.

[CoinBase]( 
@_date: 2017-08-12 06:23:47
It's 100% supply and demand. The creator doesn't have majority mining power, and thus has no control over anything to be honest. 
The price is high because lots of people and institutions are buying bitcoin. That's it.

Did I intrude on your safe space?

Posts like this make Bitcoin users look childish and ultimately is negative for the currency.

Shouldn’t you be buying trumpcoin? What are you doing here?

Wow I’d love to see your interactions with a real woman. Oh wait, you don’t say anything like this in real life. In fact, you do whatever women say in a desperate attempt to hook up with them. Then, when they choose Chad instead, you come express your anger on reddit. And here we are.

This is a forum about a currency, how is that in any way a "male space"?

Is that why you keep replying?

Yup. 
4chan has done a lot to warp your mind. I know because that was my life from 2007-2011. You too can overcome it and mature in a healthy way.

I also used to get very offended when people would call me young in the internet back when I was 12

Hahaha she lost and is no longer involved in politics at all. You need to get over it and see that “Hillary for prison” was used to distract trump supporters from the fact that he is dismantling America’s dominant position in the world.

Don’t worry, it’s just a number. The more the better.
