Nice meme... but if you honestly believe that bitcoin is better off without forks then you're completely missing the point.

This is worse than Germany Brazil, where I went to take a piss after the first 20 mins and the game was already over when I got back.

I think ebay start thinking in another cryptocoin, BTC is too slow, extremely high fees, the price isn't never stable....
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:08:48
Every guy on the eath's face is saying:
BTC hitted 1k: "It will crash soon"
BTC hitted 5k: They started to speak on the television news saying "It's just a bubble"
Now BTC is close to 20k....
Noone can know the real power of BTC.

You could try coinbase or coinspot

2014. Read about bitcoin. Whitepaper, articles, this sub. I devoted a lot of time to learning. Purchased bitcoin at around $800/BTC and watched the most valuable invention of the century tumble to 1/4 its value (1/8 if you count the flash crash to $100 that happened).
I still held on. I traded some alts for awhile. I believed bitcoin would eventually gain real traction again.
@_date: 2017-12-16 13:09:55
Also me: "Bitcoin price could go down another 20 times"
@_date: 2017-12-04 21:32:14
People don't realize that the financial system is destined to collapse due to its own internal absurdities (a debt-based economy)... Sounds like bitcoin will be blamed for it, crazy.
@_date: 2017-12-18 18:22:09
Is better is you buy a mining rig and mine for yourself.
@_date: 2017-12-13 08:31:13
Like most speculative things, a good idea is to set a reasonable exposure as % of your portfolio.  When Bitcoin got near $10000, I sold half of my holdings to maintain the % exposure I'm comfortable with.

With this wallet you can't buy coins directly(you need to send to an online exchanger and proceed). You don't need a big amount if ETH, only need 10-20$

Their money is now my money.

What you're saying, do you think Bitcoin is a scam??
I know and work with bitcoin since 2013, and I'm just 19 yo.
Yes I don't trust Goverments and Banks, FUCK THEM!

The best way. Is pretty impossibile to mine with 2GB card, your return will be ridiculous.

Bitcoin has only to resolve the fees and transaction confirms...
@_date: 2017-12-18 13:00:37
You can try on Localbitcoins or Paxful

We don’t need a post every $200. Even 1K posts are a little much
@_date: 2017-12-18 18:27:31
Just use another exchange or verify your identity and you should be fine.

Almost in the exact situation as your brother, same age and everything. It's a really bad feeling, like it hurts inside so deeply that I fucked up so badly it's really an indescribable feeling. I'm poor as shit now and could be a millionaire. Will I kill myself? Probably not. But I can absolutely understand why he did. It's a really bad feeling.
Sorry that you lost him.

Ok, I can understand 1-2$ fees, but 20-30$ for 1$ doesn't it seem a little too much?
@_date: 2017-12-11 06:58:25
It isn't just journalists. People with PHDs in economics, who really should know better, have come out with idiotic critiques against bitcoins like the lack of intrinsic value. To my knowledge, nothing mankind has ever agreed to use for transactions hasn't proceeded outstripped its intrinsic value by a large enough factor to make the difference between that value and 0 mostly irrelevant. The simple fact is that the value of transmitting economic data is far higher than the value of any commodity used to do so. As a result, I suspect a commodity that has no utility outside of transmitting data is actually marginally preferable because it frees up commodities that have other uses to be used.
@_date: 2017-12-16 05:32:31
Yes but ETH can't do many transactions a day
@_date: 2017-12-18 18:24:19
Yes, you'll more return if you invest in BCH

Why complicate things, the only tip that matters is HODL.

The most exchange need to do this manually, you can also find some guy on forums which exhcnage BTC for PP
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:26:28

If they ask tell them what a jackass you where to gamble most of it on PrimeDice. Give them a good laugh and get rid of those evil eyes.

Because cboe ain’t selling bitcoin.
Read the big bold letters on their website.
@_date: 2017-12-17 12:55:10
If you want to buy BTC try to use some forum exchange, so they'll directly send to your wallet.

Quadriga just enabled e-mail transfers. I sent some funds in earlier today and they had processed it within 5-6 hours. I was really impressed because I've been using their EFT up till this point and that takes 4-5 business days.

You should try Canadian Kraken I have zero complaints about their bank. Transactions went through without a hitch

EOS is more fast, stable and easy to use....

Andreas Antonopoulos. He is a Bitcion visionary who spends every day of his life researching Bitcoin and presenting information about Bitcoin. He's not crazy rich, just a cypherpunk who wants to change the world.

Welcome to the Cryto word!
You can buy bitcoin in localbitcon, circle, paxful, ecc....
If you'd buy alt coin like NEO, EOS, OMG, TRST ecc....You need to go on exchange website like: Bittrex, Poloniex, YoBit.
Next step is if you would hold them for a long time I suggest you to download the Exodus wallet, make a backup and store the altcoins here. 
Every crypto currency wallet has a private key.
What's a Private Key?
A private key in the context of Bitcoin is a secret number that allows bitcoins to be spent. Every Bitcoin wallet contains one or more private keys, which are saved in the wallet file. The private keys are mathematically related to all Bitcoin addresses generated for the wallet.
Because the private key is the "ticket" that allows someone to spend bitcoins, it is important that these are kept secure. Private keys can be kept on computer files, but in some cases are also short enough that they can be printed on paper.

Ok, they can also be 1% of his NETworth but are still 1.8M. Anyway hope he'll get his money
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:54:29
I think the price of BTC is also a problem, because a currency must be stable...
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:59:14
Yes... the principal problems are the high fees and the slow transaction confirms...
@_date: 2017-12-14 15:31:45
Don't forget people that are trying to push bitcoin as a store of value instead of a medium for truly free as in freedom transactions! Those are the ones who will do the most damage for the adoption of Bitcoin as something you can pay for goods and services with

This climb is insane, we literally went up $3k in one day. Personally I'm bracing for a big correction, and then buying more ;)

Anyone have a way to do this for free?
@_date: 2017-12-04 16:05:00
This is the list of altcoin which exodus wallet support: 
I suggest first to store ETH or you can't send altcoin because this is an wallet based on ETH

Companies can and do freeze customer funds without warning literally constantly...and I think this is just for stole some more money....

Don‘t worry, the price of BCH will reach $5600 in 30 days.
@_date: 2017-12-18 18:49:15
If you are buying BTC for do some transaction ok but if you’re looking to buy those 50$ and hold them in your wallet I highly suggest you to hold the BCH
@_date: 2017-12-15 09:26:15
The price of Bitcoin is determinated by the request of who buy and who sell, the more there are purchase requests the more the price increases...
We can comparate this like the Adidas Yeezy.
@_date: 2017-12-13 12:53:36
You're right, but the BTC is becoing more and more slow, and also extremely high fees per transactions....
@_date: 2017-12-11 11:25:53
A lot of people are scared of cryptocurrencies, because they will change the status quo. They are anonymous and regulation or taxation is made impossible, that's their problem and their benefit. I can see where those people come from taxes and regulation play a huge role in modern economics and can be necessary for a economy and society to be intact. They talk about not beeing backed, just beeing numbers or hackable because they are scared to infrom the public about their real properties.
