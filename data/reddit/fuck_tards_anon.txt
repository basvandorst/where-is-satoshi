Now who is baling? Fuck me - so you assume that an artificial step built in to the system is "economically scaling"
You "10 things you need to know about bitcoin" buzzfeed reading moron.

You could also try it out
What makes you think telling me I could try it out is the answer here?
@_date: 2015-11-23 13:56:09

lol. so you're saying there will be bad economics, inflation and no wealth building if you give people free money? lol ;)

You don't know what that word means
Egalitarian doesn't mean you're against POW


POW doesn't require a rising cost to invest either, bitcoin just did that (and the maths are - as the mining accelerates, it flattens out an exponential growth somewhat - this had little to do with much other than distribution / marketing of the idea / a lame attempt to "open it up" in some way / or provide a pyramid style incentive - no such ideas should belong in a wealth model, are only necessitated by the obscurity of bitcoin (relative to trade)


You are laughable


I don't think you know what any of that means


So you're a non-egalitarian commie who can't work out what they believe in, likes bitcoin kool aid, so it grasping at straws to defend your own anti-think position.
Right, gotcha.
I hope you can buy berets online with bitcoin soon.

holy shit lol "forced scarcity model pushes up desirability and value" omg and you're full retard on the increase costs. Next you'll try and crowbar the gold standard in there, when you have no concept of what currency or wealth even are.
Christ, you're so dunning kruger it's laughable.
