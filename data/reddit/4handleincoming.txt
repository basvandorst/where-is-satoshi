I'm impressed with myself for correctly predicting that Bitcoin will go to $0 when it was $20,000
Lotta people said I was missing out on the ride from 20,000 to several trillion dollars per coin.

Yeah but Bitcoins are worthless in my mind. So when people claim that "transferring bitcoins" is equal to "transferring value," they lose me.
OK They currently fetch $5450 but that becomes a self-defining statement. To wit: 
 "They tranfer value because each is worth $5450, and it totally makes sense they trade at $5450 because they transfer value."

The internet means basically to move information between devices. That is quite useful, because I can steal the movie Mission Impossible 6 from the privacy of my home.
But what about bitcoin, does it contain even a single song? The way that computer files can be useful is if they contain interesting:
1. Video
2. Audio
3. Still image
4. Text
And the way they can be useless, is if the information they contain is "noise," i.e. nothing interesting, such as a Fake Torrent.

So, I understand that Bitcoin 1 was somehow capped to 21 million (although I'm skeptical as to how something Digital can be limited, but fine).
However Bitcoin 2 was then started by Roger Veer and that means a further 21 million pieces. So now we have 42 million.
My question is, I've been seeing some talk of "bch fork." Does that mean there is now a Bitcoin 3 bringing additional 21 million coins.
For a grand total of 63 million bitcoins.

I consider it more of a Revolving Nigerian Scheme.
Namely, the perpetrator gets the victim to pay $5500 in exchange for a promise of $1,000,000
But then the victim can also become the next Nigerian Prince and email new victims. That is the revolving aspect.

It says that bitcoin "solves math problems." What kind and for whom? No one mentions.
My guess: For no one, and thus worth $0.

@_date: 2018-11-17 17:45:09
Yeah but you are trusted to deliver Nothing.
That is like saying you have a cheque from a highly credible bank to Zero cents.
Should that $0 check be worth $5450 in the market?
@_date: 2018-11-17 22:50:43
Value is basically objective, here's why.
Let's say that you and another person are brought to make some decisions.
They ask you 6 simple questions like: "Do you value a 1000 sqf house or a 10,000 sqf house more?"
Then, you try to guess what the other person decided for such questions.
Would it be "incredible" that you guessed all 6?
No, because it's obvious that people usually prefer 10,000 sqf to 1000 sqf.
But how were you able to guess, if his value judgments are subjective?
It turns out they are the same to such a statistic, that they can be called Objective.
So yes I can objectively say that bitcoin is garbation.

The only reason people were fascinated with Bitcoin, is that it was something you could buy low (load up) and then become rich if it goes up.
Fine. But this year, the brand has shifted into the opposite:
"Are you a guy who has hard earned savings? You too can lose 85%!"
With such a motto, nobody will ever want to buy bitcoin ever again.
@_date: 2018-11-17 06:30:37
Yeah that would be very useful.
Unfortunately, bitcoin has no value, so it will never have it.

Even if you could demonstrate a very tiny value, I would accept that BTC was valuable. But I actually maintain that BTC's value is $00.00 exactly.
What can you do with it? Do I require a $5500 BTC phone to send you this sentence? No, it works just as swell sending it through an unsecured series of tubes.

Money has to be a store of value OR debt money at least. Bitcoin is neither, so it's a meaningless file that does nothing.

@_date: 2018-11-17 15:35:56
Bitcoin has no use, in dentistry for example. This makes BTC intrinsic value $00.00
So it doesn't have a mechanism to store value, because you can't take $1000 and store it in $00.00
The only way to circumvent that is to make it a Debt Money. By promising to give each BTC holder something valuable, no matter what BTC price is.
But since the coin is redeemable for Nothing, then its price will go to Nothing.
@_date: 2018-11-17 17:19:10
It can be any other usage, for example if you owned 5 apartments, you could use them as money.
"If you do X for me, I'll give you an apartment."
"If you do 2X for me, I'll give you 2 apartments."
What is the intrinsic value of a home. Well one can live in it.
Or, the other way is to Redeem the token for something else. ($ = exemption from an IRS beatdown).
So, the mistake of bitcoin was thinking that 0 intrinsic value + 0 redemption value, could somehow still &gt;0.
@_date: 2018-11-17 18:23:03
So give me an example of how it can be used.
If for example I could pay $5450 to make sure this post was correctly transmitted, I would say "No thanks, current security is enough."
And thus the bagholder would receive $0 even though his software was undoubtedly tight.
@_date: 2018-11-15 14:17:32
If the price is 00.01 dollars, then you could load up 10,000 coins for a C note.
Which in case it goes back to ATH you have 200 million dollars.
A lot of people would take those odds: Sacrifice $100 to receive $200,000,000 in a not-so-likely scenario.
@_date: 2018-11-17 16:07:05
That is why I added that Debt Money was a way to transcend intrinsic value.
Namely if you take $100,000 to the IRS they will take your -$100,000 tax debt and make it $0.

Not really, because it is all nonsense.
Namely bitcoin has no value, because you can do Nothing with it in the privacy of your home by yourself.
It also is no one's debt, so it can't be redeemed for anything at the IRS or otherwise.

Intrinsic value doesn't mean that the object has value in absence of humans.
Rather it means that the object is the very thing the human desires, and not a representation or an intermediate step. (Like the dollar is just a stepping stone, and not the end goal.)
So USD and BTC have no intrinsic value, because they can't be directly enjoyed, they have to be extrinsically exchanged for "the real enjoyment."
@_date: 2018-11-17 16:21:48

Yeah but I meant for the victim, i.e. bitcoin buyer.
Can it be said that him forking over $5400 for a nigerian scam PROVES that it provided exactly that much value to him.
I don't think so, I feel that the fair value of the scam is $0 even if the buyer bid $5400.
To him the allure was selling higher to a greater fool. So I consider BTC to be the same as nigerian prince.

It's very difficult to recover an investment, because when you lose 60%, then it is not enough to gain 60%.
(100-60=40 ; 40 x 1.6 = 64)

This matter is not too complicated, maybe a dozen moving parts.
But it's just complex enough, to be sidestepped by shallow debaters.
For example some of the Parts of the conversation are "gold" and "fiat." This already provides 2 distractions:
Discusser A: "Crypto is digital gold."
Discusser B: "Wait, but gold is a real metal."
Discusser A: "But the dollar isn't. Burned!"
This way, the pro-crypto arguer implies that making 3 flimsy and incorrect arguments is roughly equal to 1 strong one.

His defense is that his coin fits the description of the Satoshi Bible, therefore he's entitled to use the name Bitcoin. Even moreso than Bitcoin Noncash is.
I agree that he's acting weird on the following point. If some layman says: "Hey I saw on TV there was this thing called bitcoin." And Ver says: "Sure I have one to sell you for only $400."
That would be confusing for the layman, because it sounds like it fell from 5500 to 400, which it didn't yet.
