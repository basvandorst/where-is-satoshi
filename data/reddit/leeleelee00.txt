Hey I'm from the UK and withdrawing from coinbase has been such a pain  and I imagine if your a noob or not tech savvy a complete nightmare ,  is there a date set for when Barclays retail customers  will able to withdraw from  coinbase ? Or is this just going to be for institutional Barclays customers?

Was reading about bitcoin transaction times and fees, how is bitcoin going to be  speeded up/cheaper fees for it to be used for everyday use ?

Hopefully sooner I've watched/read quite a bit about litecoin could be a better coin to use for everyday use faster and cheaper than btc

Hopefully a good way  to transfer crypto to fiat will happen , I had hoped litepay debit card would work But It fell through and ten x won't work 
Whichever company creates a good product for crypto to fiat will have 1st mover advantage imo
