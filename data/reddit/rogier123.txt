You absolutely should do what feels best to you. I don't read danisch so I cant say much about that site.

 is for whole of europe a good option. (Full disclosure: I'm kinda prejudiced because I work there.)

For bitcoins actually not that much, most of our profits come from alt-coins. 
Yes we have a margin (I honestly don't know the exact margin), but we offer good service (that's me! :)) and you can trust us.

I did and I corrected myself since I made a mistake in a calculation. 
In my first calculation I added the TAX we paid on payment fees (like creditcard, Giropay...)
This is however not true, so the amount of taxes we will get back is about 15k€ (as corrected in the first post).

Well, you've done the math...
This is however not a topic about LiteBit.eu but about the ruling by ECJ.

As for the prices, this also depends on the actually rates. The margins are lowered though.

I didn't mention it because I don't want people to see me as a spammer. Our exchange is litebit.eu, we're especially for customers wanting to use local payment methods like iDeal, SOFORT and Giropay.

This is huge news for us, I work at a dutch exchange as CTO. We had a meeting this morning, we'll be getting about 15k€ back from the dutch tax office.

The margin on a order of 10k would be about €200. However we don't know for sure.
We paid taxes over the profit we make with selling and buying bitcoins. We do not keep 20% for ourselves. (that would be kinda dickish)
If you give me your order id's I can look into this.

I do understand your thinking, however that's a different tax system.
We do not charge customers VAT directly. Mostly because we can't be 100% sure what we made with an order.

We can see this as an example ruling. We will follow it with other digital currency as well.

The fees have been reduced by 20% this morning. The 15k€ will go in development.
@_date: 2015-10-22 09:57:57
A good question. We've reduced the margins by 20% this morning (since we don't have to pay the 21% tax anymore over our margins).
Paying back our customers would be very hard. It would be about €0.35 on average per customer. We're investing this money in new features and projects.

Taxes work a little different, we pay them over our margins, not turnover. If we made 200 euro of your orders, we paid 40 in taxes. We don't directly charge tax on customers, because our rates can in the end differ from our predicted rates.
I'm no accountant, but our accountant says its legit.
