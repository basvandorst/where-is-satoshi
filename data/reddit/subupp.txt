Sorry to hear the loss!  Unfortunately, massive amount of such cryptocurrency related scams are infesting Twitter as well.  Scammers masquerade as popular Twitter authors and send out tweets in the form of a followup tweet, about some eth/BTC promotional giveaways whereby one needs to send the scammer a small amount of funds to receive in turn an x\-times amount in return.  I used to try to track down these scammers and post warning messages but after a few days gave up, after realizing the scam tweets are generated by automated bots incessantly and in massive numbers \(One day I sent out nearly 250 such scam alert messages following each scam tweet\).  
To get an idea how rampant these cryptocurrency related scams are on Twitter, simply do a twitter search for the expression "This is once in a lifetime chance!" and you will turn up tons of result.  
Here's a partial screen shot of the search result I did just now. A total of about 50 hits and another 30 new hits are waiting in line for viewing:

Many of the victims of  the scams wonder if you can somehow get your stolen funds back. Unfortunately there's nothing you can do about it, unless the wallet address owner \(scammer\) voluntarily sends it back to you.  
You are lucky your bad luck stopped at sending out your bitcoin..  There are innocent people who got scammed a second time right after, by falling for a secondary scam where scammers pretend to be cryptocurrency scam funds recovery/reclaim service.  See the attached screenshot of a thread at Etherscan's Disqus forum about someone who got scammed a second time falling for such a service:
