Really don't see how this can be good news in any way. Lot of us lost a lot of BTC, that shit isn't coming back. Why the fuck would I ever use anything related in any way to gox again? Stole your coins, but we won't do it again! I'm sure they'll rebuild that userbase real quick....

That's what caught my eye too. 
Fucking bureaucrats.

Except you can't fake support tickets to print more.

shill it is

annnnnnnnnnnnd, be-headed. (or raped then imprisoned for being raped, depending on what gender the owner is. Wait, women don't have property rights.)
@_date: 2014-02-22 14:46:02
I gotta stop reading about shit on reddit.
@_date: 2014-02-17 12:45:12
I'm guessing he trusted his BTC with a guy who can't manage to buy a shirt that fits.
@_date: 2014-01-27 19:36:25
I know you are but what am I!
@_date: 2014-03-16 19:11:58
Here man, I've got a no-lose situation for you here. Bet against this ridiculous outlook, you're sure to win! Just let me hold onto your BTC until november when the bet is over.
@_date: 2014-03-06 14:37:12
I would agree with this. Unfortunately the likelihood of that happening is somewhere around 0.

Don't listen to him bro, he's a terrorist!
@_date: 2014-03-24 17:49:19
Don't be the voice of reason. I want to see a new one of these threads everyday. Everyday goddamnit!
@_date: 2014-02-21 12:50:29
Oh, you're right. They're the one with the forced migrant labor. I always get my sandy countries mixed up.

Oh yeah, that Norwegien woman got pardoned after she was imprisoned for being raped. Sorry I'm glossing over their huge strides in the arena of human rights.
@_date: 2014-02-21 14:10:22
Fair enough, I'll leave my comment for the downvotes. Apologies for making sensationalized generalizations to degrade the nation. I get a little bent out of shape with nations that have human rights records such as the UAE, that said here in the US we're not any better.

In 208 moves? jesus man you're some kind of wizard.
@_date: 2014-01-14 12:01:15
yeah..... moving over to litecoin.
@_date: 2014-02-18 13:54:34
Stop defending gox man!
@_date: 2014-02-24 06:12:25
I like this guys attitude.
@_date: 2014-01-27 12:43:57
Either a total sucker, or a total shill.
@_date: 2013-12-14 16:40:04
Hah, sup Rochester buddy. Nice to see crypto supporters/developers in the frozen north.
@_date: 2013-10-31 11:36:10
Not sure why you're being downvoted. People here want Bitcoin taken seriously, but they always love this kind of sensationalized shit. I mean I can't speak of the software itself, but "introduction" or whatever looked like some cheesey alt-rock music video.
@_date: 2013-11-14 15:31:58
This is easily the worst identity verification system I've ever used.
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:17:15
I wish this was the case, I've set in an order at $175, by the time bitfloor returns with my cash... it'll probably be back up to $250 :E
@_date: 2013-11-20 15:02:58
Bitcoin isn't going away, but this kind of thing is 100% to be expected. Most people don't even understand the money they use today. You know how many "normal" people understand what Quantative Easing even is? It's totally reasonable for people to be skeptical of something which has been primarily covered in the mass media due to it's use in illicit activities. I'm not saying he's not grossly uninformed, I'm just saying his sentiments should be met with reason, not derision.
@_date: 2013-11-14 15:33:29
Then the customer blaming.
So instead of just uploading a photo ID, I have to tell the exact year / model of a car that I sold 5 years ago. This is just a piss-poor system, period. You should fire whoever came up with it.
@_date: 2013-10-17 04:14:53
And now I know there is such thing as a headphone amp. Nice!
@_date: 2013-10-31 15:07:38
Upon further thought, it is actually probably not all that bad. The more "cool" things like bitcoin seem, the faster the adoption rate among a younger crowd. So in the end, it's probably neither good nor bad, just a bit cheesy for an older more "even keel" crowd.
@_date: 2013-08-12 14:48:55
there is hope!!
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:16:18
Trying to buy a measley $800 worth, bitfloor tanks
...hard times
By the time they process my trade it'll be back up to $200+ rather than the $175 I bought at
@_date: 2013-11-14 17:11:49
So instead they picked a shit system to use instead of building it themselves. Boy am I relieved.
