I'd like to have a look at that paper if you find it. Why alts still make up 33% of total market cap is beyond me. I expect BTC to moon in your timeframe, and very few alts to survive.

Thank you!

That's very conservative in my opinion. Who's to say 3% won't be going into crypto? And BTC at 60%? Another assumption. Stock to flow is the way to go, and will kill off most altcoins. Expect 300k in the run up to the halvening 4.5 years from now.

Coinz. Buy. Hodl. Moon.

Look at the 200 daily and weekly moving averages. It's stuck in between. Once it breaks either way you make your move. Or just hodl like I've done.

Buy as much as you can (afford to lose), hodl it offline, and pray Duterte doesn't crack down on it - in which case you move abroad in 6-7 years. Ideally you should hold at least 2 BTC. One to set up your ideal life when you're in you 20's, and another for retirement in your 40's.

Me neither.

You mean the salary they've negotiated for their labor?
@_date: 2019-10-11 17:27:10
Buy anything below 8k. If you wait for 6k you'll never get in. 7200 is possible but not likely.

People getting up at 6:30 to go to work are irresponsible, lazy socialists?

We agree. But like you say, they can't kill BTC, but they can ban it at the same time as they promote IMFcoin. I don't think anything like this is likely, however I do worry about the day BTC challenges USD as the world reserve currency in say 2028ish.

There's no way for wire transfers to be 15 usd. Basically free here in europe. Now explain to me why my bigmac shouldnt cost me 9 usd.

Unless the IMF introduces a decentralized worldwide reserve currency on a blockchain, BTC will remain king.

The Investor's Podcast 260 featuring PlanB, from a week ago, gives some interesting thought to what's coming in the years ahead. By 2025 we may be pricing dollars in satoshis, not the other way around. Monetary premiums on stocks, bonds and housing markets, where wealth is usually parked, may be moved to BTC. 
What I find interesting about the S2f-model is how it doesn't take into account how many millions of BTC are already lost on scrapped old harddrives. His model may even be UNDERestimating the pricing curve ahead.
Either way, welcome to crypto, none of us get it, just hodl :)

This is very bullish. S2f value of 55.000 usd by summer of 2020. Add in FOMO and financial planners buying in to the model and taking a long view, the following year could see the price go parabolic like nothing we could have ever imagined. By 2024 we'll be valuing dollars in satoshis, not the other way around. 
Stocks and housing losing monetary premiums would be healthy for society aswell. 
Hope he's right. (He has been so far.)
@_date: 2019-09-28 17:27:27
Yes. Keep accumulating until halvening, take profits the following year if you must.

Do: Buy, hodl, repeat. 
Don't: Leveraged trades, take on debt, sell.
