Unfortunately his show is not a good place for investment advice in my opinion. When Bear Stearns was collapsing, he couldn't say to "get out", that is if he wanted to keep his job. So he told people to stay in it. If he would have said to "get out of Bear Stearns", there would be blood on the streets of Bear Stearns in minutes of announcement. A "lesser of two evils" type of decision. xD

If in the USA, the exchange to go is **Coinbase PRO** (*Not the regular Coinbase*).
**Coinbase PRO** helps you avoid high fees when purchasing 1 full btc or any amount of btc for that matter.
And as others have said, Ledger or Trezor are the best to hold your funds. (Never leave BTC in any exchange long term). You may get REKT.

This is "MY" guess. Take it with a grain of salt. As of this moment, I "think" btc is going sideways because big money players may be waiting what the FED will do tomorrow, lowering Fed Funds Rate (kind of a big deal in the financial world). Now, doing a fibonacci retracement on btc chart, the bear-downside probabilities are that trading bots will either push for 8.5k or 7.2K (maaaybe 6.4k, but thats a very, very low probability right now). The bull-upside fib. retracement is that btc needs to surpass 9.8K &amp; 10.1K to gain bull momentum again. (This is where 21 &amp; 55 EMA are acting as resistance right now.)
It's kinda of a snowball effect. Just that btc hasn't decided where to go yet. But once you see the snowball rolling, that's when you pull the trigger on whatever you want to do. Not before. - Good luck!

Buy whenever you feel it's the lowest for you. Just DO NOT EVER go all in. Buy little by little. (Little is define by you).
Leave the big buys for $6k/3k. Go crazy if we go to $1k/2k. No one knows if we'll reach these levels, but if we do, now you know what to do. 
Coinbase Pro might be a good start if in the USA.
Good luck.

Thing about buying is that you don't know where the **true low** is til afterwards. This ***COULD*** be the lowest, but it can also ***NOT*** be. 
**You must decide that. Not us.**  
Say you go all in, and it drops 6k/5k next month. What would u do?  
Say you go half, and it skyrockets to 13K. What would u do?
You must do what you feel comfortable &amp; be conform with that decision, regardless of what happens a month from now or next year. Good luck! B-)

The way the FED is handling the REPO market makes me think otherwise.  (Especially with the overnight operation increase of **$120 Billion-a-day** has already started).
It's possible that maybe at $50K-$100K, people might get wary on switching back to fiat or selling their btc for fiat, hence causing the increase to those levels. But what do I know....I'm just a random person on the internet. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

**Lessons to be learned here:**
* NEVER go "all" in at once (especially at highs).
* ALWAYS DCA *(Daily Cost Average)* your way to BTC (Preferably find a good entry point). For this rally we just had, December/January was the best entry point. Wait for the next one. (Coming soon)
* Because you went all in, you will now have to wait a while (3-6 months) before you break even. (That's the penalty for going all in at once)
* BTC rallies are high, but will come down just as equally.
* Don't daytrade (or weektrade) if you don't know what you're doing. HODL instead.
* If you sell now (or later below $13.3K), you will confirm your loses. If you HODL, you will have an actual chance of getting your money back, plus a little more.

Cuz they're stupid and probably got in at a bad entry point.
Going in at a bad entry point (like a high in BTC), DCA will sort of work, but you have to put in more cash than the initial one to start making a good dent.

I pulled out 10% of my IRA into crypto back in Sept. 2017 (max amount to withdraw for cryptocurrency in my opinion). Bought right at the dip when it went from 5k to 2.9k. Had to pay taxes on the early withdrawal, but was worth it since i double my money. I bought a little bit from there on out up to 6K. (Dollar cost averaging)
Now unless you can time this accordingly, you may or may not be as lucky as I was. The current best dip was a few days ago (dip to $5.9K), but no one does if it will go back down or up from here. If you decide to withdraw from IRA, dollar cost average your purchase. Not all at once.
