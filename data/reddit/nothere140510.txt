KNC claims that their customers are businesses and not consumers. Businesses are not as protected even in the EU. 
Are you sure that noone sued KNC over this?

What is interesting is how they have changed their minds just recently - [forum link](

Your question is justified!
KNCminers solvency is of concern. I find it unlikely that the company is insolvent but if that were to be the case then it is relevant to have information regarding their BTC holdings. I would speculate that the Swedish authorities are not fully informed regarding the extent of their mining operations. Again, this is pure speculation!
Regarding the statement that miners have been made aware - poor communication on my part. What I mean to say is that the community are not happy with how refunds have been handled and this has been a point of concern.
If you read the last five pages at [bitcointalk]( then you will perhaps understand what I am getting at. 
Fair answer?

This is why I'd like to collect as much information about KNCminer address' but the community seems to disagree and have been holding out. Basically I've only recieved one address associated with KNC.

What I mean is that the consumer is more protected than businesses. But I agree with you. They couldve might as well claimed that you are a banana if you purchase from, it still doesn't make you a banana :)
