I agree with you wholeheartedly; I've always heard positive things about Mr. Buffett. I never knew his stance on Bitcoin until this was posted, and perhaps his opinion has changed. I'd be curious to know when this comment was made about Bitcoin, and it could have been (at the time) a fair—and reasonable—statement on the risk of investing into a new currency concept.

It definitely helped me. Thanks!
@_date: 2014-12-22 01:07:32
Thank you *so* much this is amazing! *You're* amazing!

Wow, thank you so much! That is incredibly nice of you! I'm a graphic designer so had a lot of fun putting the image together. 
@_date: 2014-12-22 06:57:54
From what I've recently learned, it seems like a pretty intuitive platform. [Here's a handy guide]( from their website!
@_date: 2014-12-22 20:09:31
I certainly will, thank you so much!
@_date: 2014-12-27 00:20:33
Fantastic! Can't wait.
@_date: 2014-12-22 03:54:31
I truly can't wait until I understand what this means. I'm delving into all of the introductory videos I can about Bitcoin, and hoping to get to the level of understanding that you all appear to be. Thanks for inspiring me to press forward!

EDIT: I can't spell gifted, apparently.
Also, *I am so happy* about the tips! You are all a fabulous and welcoming community. Thank you so much!

To be fair, Warren Buffett isn't quite a fool; he's avowed to donate 90%+ of his wealth to charities. That doesn't mean he understands Bitcoin, of course, but at least he isn't a greedy old man. 
@_date: 2014-12-25 05:49:25
Merry Christmas to you! Even if I don't get anything, best wishes to you and yours.
@_date: 2014-12-21 22:01:07
Ahh! Thank you so much, kind person!
@_date: 2014-12-22 04:11:24
Thanks for this inspiring writeup! I am just getting into understanding Bitcoin, and so far I have received such positive feedback and support from the Bitcoin community. And as you point out, that's what it is all about—the people believing in this new way of life and digital currency.
I hope to learn as much as I can in the weeks/months to come, thanks again for giving me an example of what I may soon aspire to myself!
@_date: 2014-12-21 22:01:38
Thanks, @_date: 2014-12-25 06:02:24
@_date: 2015-01-11 20:23:39
That's perfectly understandable, and thank you very much for your kindness! 
@_date: 2015-01-15 05:14:47
Thanks for the advice! I have played the game so much that I've gotten all of the letters and the rocket. Luckily I saw the button and have been seeing how far I can get. My current record is 4,897m.

**Right There on the Doorstep**
It was an abrupt sound. The childless, elderly couple sauntered to the front door with ready eyes. The nearest neighbor was too far to regard, and a visitor to their rural home was far beyond expected.
They both readied themselves at the anticipation and apprehension of finding a stranger at the threshold; there were no living relatives, and nary had an acquaintance willing enough to travel the squalid journey without a message of heavy news or circumstance. 
As they approached the door with outward, waiting faces, their gaze was met with the familiar emptiness of the bleak landscape. Partially relieved, they exchanged reactions of unspoken confusion. With nowhere else to look, both of them directed their eyes to the doorstep. The man let out an audible gasp that pierced the shrill silence and shocked her just as much as what occupied their stoop.
“Is that—,” she started.
The man's expression changed directly to one of moxie. He turned his gaze and went back inside, a draft trailing his journey through the house. 
“Do you need—"
“Yeah.” 
She knew not to leave her post, staying transfixed and attentive. The remoteness of their home, at first a promising comfort in their solitude, now felt highly suspicious. Familiar sounds were now met with a quick turn of her alert gaze. The man was rustling around in the back room, shifting items to get to other items, searching for what he was going to need. He did so swiftly but carefully, knowing the objective.
When he returned, she looked at what he was holding. Although she knew, her eyes shifted up to his piercing, brown eyes. A furrow came across her forehead as her right hand reached over her heart.
“Are you *really* going to—“
She already knew the answer, but the emotion came over her before she could stifle it. The man knelt down at the doorstep and began.
“It’s really something...” she said.
She gave one last gaze at the suspicious nothingness and turned back into the house, leaving him to his work.
****** 
It was five years before the document was ready. He was done; Daybreak was nigh, but the man’s weary eyes shone with exhaustion and pride. She knew not to ask, but the words started to rush out before she could stop them.
“What did you do with the—“
The terrific sound echoed as her complexion paled, fearful of the imminent danger she felt at his assertiveness. To break away from the moment, she turned readily to busy herself with packing. It couldn’t be much, but there was ample room for overnight items and a change of garments. The man, feeling wretched for scaring her, touched her shoulder softly as she passed by him.
“Speak to no one,”
She gave a small nod of understanding, accepting his apology. 
The blackness had been broken with pale light by the time stepped out on the porch. The horizon looked clear for miles as she readied herself. The new day gave promise, and she was not afraid. 
He watched her through the door, her head straight and ready as she looked out into the dawn’s emptiness. The door creak interrupted her thoughts as he walked out with her travel belongings; she turned her head slightly to the left to acknowledge his presence. They were right there on the doorstep, he directly behind her as they silently regarded the horizon. His hand came up and rested on her shoulder, letting her know it was time to go. In her newfound confidence, she boldly turned towards his tired, blue-lit face. They silently communicated their goodbyes, and his eyes fell downwards. She followed his gaze and looked at the document he held in his dry hands. Recognizing the title, she understood. As she read on, her mouth fell open at the name he had written under it. Shock and wonder broke her previous air of confidence. She began to stammer.
“Wh-what? Wait—W-why? I…I don’t understand. But *you* did. That’s...But that’s not—"
Anticipating her reaction, he smiled gently and freed his left hand from the document. He held it up to appease her as she sobbed quietly into her shaking hand. Her eyes shone bright with the early sun as a tear escaped down her cheek. He caressed her wet face, collecting the tear with his tattered thumb. 
“I wrote it for you."

You are so incredibly nice! Thank you for your generosity!

Thank you so much! I really appreciate that, and will watch it this weekend for sure! Yes, I'm finding the Satoshi Nakamoto identity question really interesting; I was unaware of his/their elusiveness until recently, so curious to learn more. 
Appreciate it!
@_date: 2015-01-15 19:46:01
@_date: 2015-01-14 16:50:25
Definitely. And Tom Ashbrook is my absolute favorite.
@_date: 2015-01-15 06:21:56
Perfect! Thank you so much for taking the time to describe this. I'll try it in the morning when I get to work. May I ask what you use for audiobook listening? I just spent my one credit on Audible.com and am already needing another one, hah.
@_date: 2015-01-08 23:28:57
This might be a dumb question, but when you "spend" BTC in the game, does it actually extract from what will be given to you for playing?
@_date: 2015-01-15 05:56:34
All of these points are perfectly valid and I actually agree with all of them! The UI needs work, and I am hoping that these will be amended in future app updates. I really irks me that the sound is unavoidable, as I would like to play and listen to something else on my phone. What glitch is it to which you speak? I would love to take advantage of that one myself. I agree with the limits to the game once you attain what seems to be the climax—collecting S A R U TO B I. Now the game is essentially about collecting in-game Bitcoin and await getting tipped real Bitcoin. I guess it could be worse, but something I enjoy doing when listening to audiobooks (on my computer, of course, since I can't on my phone whilst playing the game). 
@_date: 2015-01-04 19:39:16
Thank you for making this! The price has been dropping so people (Bitcoin haters) seem to be using that as an example of how useless Bitcoin is. Couldn't be further from the truth.
Thanks again!
@_date: 2015-01-09 02:31:58
As soon as I hit *save* I knew it was a silly question, haha. Thank you for answering to confirm it!
@_date: 2015-01-13 21:27:47
Thanks for confirming, I'm sure it's an issue they are looking to resolve and will most likely come out with new update soon.
@_date: 2015-01-08 23:23:29
This is great! The game is a bit limited right now (at least to my understanding) but adding my wallet address was seamless and I've already gotten tipped for playing. I've currently been overwhelmed at how many iOS games there are, but this kind of incentive is getting me into it. Can't wait to see where this is headed.
@_date: 2015-01-12 05:27:39
Thank you so much for the information! It helped a lot.

Wow thanks so much for explaining all of this! So what would be my first step to creating my own?
@_date: 2015-01-12 05:28:07
Ok, awesome. That makes sense. Thanks so much!

Everybody poops.
@_date: 2015-01-03 00:34:40
Hey thanks so much for taking the time to explain it! That's so fascinating. I'll try reading the white paper shortly—and I am sure it will explain what I'm about to ask—but what does "mined the Genesis block" necessarily entail? I do know vaguely about Bitcoin mining in regards to finding loose transactions of Bitcoin and being rewarded for finding them (Which is still over my head currently), but how was one mined to start?
50 bits for your explanation!
@_date: 2015-01-02 07:24:04
I apologize for my ignorance, but what is the deal with Josh Garza? I am new to Bitcoin so still figuring things out, I've just heard his name a few times lately and seems to be a shady business person but I'm not sure of all of the logistics.
@_date: 2015-01-03 00:19:26
So this was the start of Bitcoin as we know it, right? Is there an elevator pitch someone could give me that sums up what this meant? Sorry for my ignorance, still learning about Bitcoin and really excited to learn more in the new year.
