This ain't $TSLA brother

Indeed. But I tend to make decisions rather on historical data and current fundamental trends than doing nothing.
@_date: 2018-09-11 18:06:35
Yep. If History repeats itself indeed it is gonna be bearish.

Thank you. :-)

That's the context of this post brother. Elon dreamed of price rising but it didn't. C of the OHLC is the reality while the candlestick chart is imaginary in Elon's mind.
This is to constitute Crytpcorrency HODLers awaiting a big bull run with Elon's $TSLA ambition.

I wouldn't say otherwise but it exists whether you like it or not

Would you do the same if you had to withdraw $100,000 USD? Of course not.
$10 or $100,000 the process is always the same.
Sorry you don't see the point except the words. Learn how to conclude a statement properly.

If the factor is 10 then yes I have pretty much put them out. 
In regard to your point, unlike Bitcoin that creates its supply by requiring computational power, electricity etc. Banks use magical theories to create Fiat by taking from people and giving them back to banks. 
Pull one string and you're Fiat-broke. Pull one Mining Node your Bitcoin is still the same.

Yes it will but not 6 months

Maybe it's already happened and we don't know. We'll know it in 10 years.

Imagine joining the mailing list yet you read none of them.
@_date: 2018-10-31 12:55:16
What else could it be at the moment that we will have that same feeling after 10 years apart from Bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-10-31 09:49:44
I think it is. Bitcoin came as a ghost to scare bankers. They thought it was only for the Halloween but the ghost never left. Bankers are scared for real now.

LMAO What kind of an amateur piece of shit. You don't even know how to read an article and probably not even a chart. You didn't see the other links provided below the chart in the article to see how I got the idea. 
Here refer to this,
I wonder what kind of a prick would judge people without getting to know them.
@_date: 2018-10-17 16:58:55
The pretty retarded still exists even if the Mt.Gox happened. You should wake up man. Bitcoin ain't dead.

There is nothing to edit. Whether it's 10 years or 100 years, 1 BTC will always be 1 BTC.

I'd love to know more of what you see here

It's meant to show how fast Bitcoin reacts in market in contrast to the Monthly XAUUSD chart. Gold hasn't even been able to catch up with Bitcoin's pace though it's already been more than 30 years.
