nope. First go at it. Matter of fact, I am pretty new to Reddit. 
@_date: 2014-08-18 18:12:42
Those are legitimate points. Okay, I will try now to reach out to the family now. 
@_date: 2014-08-13 20:03:38
can you email me at tylerspr or facebook message me. My name is Tyler Springer 
@_date: 2014-08-18 18:04:45
Yes, I thought about that. That is why I posted my name. Not sure if that is enough but maybe if I could even get $1k and then donate to the family then people will see I am legitimate. Any suggestions for establishing more trust? 
@_date: 2014-08-13 05:43:31
Let's do it. You have What's App or facebook messenger? My phone number is 1.206.372.6208. 
@_date: 2014-08-18 18:53:56
Let me know if you have any suggestions. I have contacted someone with the family and supplied all my information. Hopefully I can get them to confirm I am who I say I am quickly and then we can see if we can raise some funds quickly!

It worked!

So, I'm not getting much traction on this. First time attempting this and learned I probably need the recipient to validate the wallet address. Anyway, I tried to contact the family and if I don't hear back from them today I will just donate the money received (basically just a bit from me and a friend, ha) to the families website they set up using USD. Till next time!

Okay, I just sent an email to the someone with the family that is helping in fundraising efforts so I'll be back. Btw, this is me 
Maybe you can call me at my work line and I'll verify who I am if you want to donate a few bucks. Thanks for the advice! 
@_date: 2014-08-13 18:46:36
ha! Biggest problem so far is just getting in direct communication with someone. Think I finally connected on facebook messenger. 
@_date: 2014-08-16 16:48:04
It worked!
@_date: 2014-08-12 16:01:35
So I just messaged Llikenbin. Let's see if this works! 
@_date: 2014-08-12 20:36:47
Are you in Beunos Aires? Or somewhere far away from USA? 
@_date: 2014-08-12 16:07:55
haha, oops
@_date: 2014-08-13 18:54:20
Get any takers?
