Signups are now CLOSED for round 2 of the Totle Portfolio Tournament! 
Good luck everyone!

Yeah GREAT point. Anyone who likes fantasy sports may end up loving crypto as well with a fun combo of both here.

Yeah that was a pretty small correction I feel. Great time to buy when those dips hit!

We are at a crossroads indeed... sad to see the US not supporting digital assets like Japan has.

Hey thanks!
It is actually a really fun &amp; free way to compete with friends, brush up on your trading strategies, or even win some free crypto!
Tell a friend!

yeah that is a good set of coins. I will have to d/l that to my phone and try it out. 
Have you heard of the Totle Portfolio manager? Going to be a great way to diversify quickly without having to open multiple wallets and exchanges.

What is the easiest way to diversify your portfolio without having to open a bunch of wallets &amp; exchanges?

wow that is actually a really sweet story...

how many coins does Jaxx support? I have never used that wallet, as I tend to not use mobile to store my coins.

Lightning network + Atomic Swaps would be a killer combination. We might just see BOTH in 2018!
