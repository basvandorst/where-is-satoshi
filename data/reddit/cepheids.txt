I'd send some if they weren't in Gox... Best of luck.

That is a terrible idea. We will not "steal" anyone's bitcoins.
A better idea would be a community sanctioned bailout where the lost coins are found, and voided, and new coins created instantly.

Likely to be all gone unless MtGox resumes operation and earns back the lost amount as transaction fees, which will probably take centuries.

Debt holders need to collectively rise up to seek a solution for ourselves. This is a catastrophic loss to too many individuals. Some lost a tiny amount, others a significant portion of their money, others everything.

I'd look at Coindesk or Bitpay.

That is not true. 2% of all bitcoins is several times the average transaction volume. It is the transaction volume that matters when it comes to moving price.

Other PoW altcoins are simply insecure. And PoS alts are just absolute garbage.

Bitcoin cannot be stable at such a price. This range is still primarily for speculation. For stability to happen, widespread adoption must happen. I'm talking about at least 10% of the world's population using Bitcoin regularly to conduct business.
Now, there are 21 million bitcoins in total (not yet, but whatever). There are 7 billion people in the world. 10% of that is 700 million people.
How much money does 700 million people require to conduct their businesses? About $5k each at the minimum?
That's a 3.5 trillion market cap. BTC needs to get to 160k a piece to have enough value for stable use.
Whatever number you decide to plug into the estimate, the current price is simply too low for real and meaningful use.
Whether you buy Bitcoin is basically a bet on whether Bitcoin will eventually get there and if so, how long it will take.
I think it will, and it won't be long. HODL.

Bitcoin will adopt what ETH had tried and tested and proven to be good.

Of course, but the question would be, how much and when.
