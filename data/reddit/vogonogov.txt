Wouldn't it be better for Namecoin if more people would run a full node? 
Also, let's assume a decentralized reddit would be built. And with decentralized I do not mean like  but like  Now let's say Onename accounts would be used. If the API would be used, then each installation would request each user of each post and comment. To prevent requesting the users over and over again you would start caching or storing the users on each installation. Essentially this is like copying the search index db from the resolver.  Wouldn't it make sense to run a project like the resolver for each installation?
Edit: even if you would run a 'normal' centralized website using the accounts of Onename, wouldn't it make more sense to run a resolver yourself so you would not have the delay of requesting the API?

Great job on the model, the openness to let people poke holes in it and accepting that not all is perfect yet. I think we can greatly improve voting systems with crypto.
Have you seen the [BitCongress Whitepaper]( I haven't had the time to dive into the details but I think they also use pre-qualified addresses and tokens but they use smart contracts to prevent double-voting.

He's pretty wrong about this as well. Total of the top 500 supercomputers in the world is about [308851 PFLOPS at Rmax or 453502 PFLOPS at Rpeak]( Bitcoin currently clocks in at [4440715 PFLOPS](
Which makes it about 15 times faster at Rmax and about 10 times faster at Rpeak.
