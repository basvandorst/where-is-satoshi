first you would need to agree on what the 'central authority' would do to stabalize - something not even the members of the federal reserve board can agree on today.  Then you would need to figure out how to decentralize it through some distributed algorithm and trust mechanism. IMO this is not going to happen any time soon

is a usb stick really not secure enough for you?

so where do you put bitcoin in terms of percent diffusion right now?

you are forgetting the critical security aspect of running an exchange.  Hosting anywhere you do not have tight physical control over your servers presents significant new risks.

this seems like a gross overestimate given world GDP of what $70 trillion?
Bitcoins transactions currently make up an infinitesimally small fraction of that - not even close to a 15-18 percent mark --- try somewhere between 10^-4 and 10^-6 percent by my (perhaps questionable) estimate.

most informative bitcoin article yet

you've got it backwards, raising interest rates creates a deflationary effect on the dollar - reducing the demand for a hedge against inflation like the bitcoin or gold.  That said I don't see it happening any time soon.

It seems unfair to account for the cost of the BFL 60/GH miner without accounting for its potential payoff somehow
