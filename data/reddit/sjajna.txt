I usually don't click on those fishy links and banners, but it can happen to anyone in daily internet usage. You come to Reddit, see some link, click, aaaand it's gone.

The hacker posted the link via my profile. And then I saw the comment on it, from another hacked user. Figured there's more of us being used to spread the link, and there are.
They even tried to improve my profile "credibility" by trying to verify my email. Got note from Reddit at the same time the malicious link was posted.

It downloads malware to your computer which then accesses your wallet, gets what you own and accesses your profiles and spreads the link further.

Malicious web page beware! Post creator check your wallet. You have probably also been hacked.

There's much more of those by the same owner, they're posting them around Reddit and you can stumble upon by googling. They're disguised as news about crypto currencies, but you get to the site and malicious software is downloaded, waiting for you to get off the computer for 5 mintues and he's performing his magic. If you don't have ultra measures against this and your Windows don't catch it he'll get what he wants.

No. He posted a link to a site which my firewall didn't detect. He then used my computer to get into the wallet and post on Reddit.
This is the only conclusion I could get because Bittrex usually sends email if someone logged into from another computer, and that didn't happen this time.
I'm not tech-savy so I'd love to hear your explanations.
