Of course he has to say this. Imagine if the US president came out and said 'bitcoin is a better currency than the USD, USD is trash'

Right. Goldman Sachs' Circle invested 400M to buy poloniex. Bakkt (NYSE/Microsft/Starbucks) invested hundreds of millions into their exchange and likely a similar amount for Fidelity DA. I have no doubt FB invested hundreds of millions into libra. Amazon and google currently hiring people in the crypto space. So they did all this knowing that Trump or the SEC is going to shut down crypto?

Its very clear what's going to happen here.
Incoming of institutional capital, fixed supply asset with halvening in 2020.
Increased demand, reduced supply, only one thing can happen to the price.

Tell her: 'cash out by selling it to me'
@_date: 2019-07-16 00:18:20
Everything is based on thin air.

Fuck = Buy ?
@_date: 2019-07-16 00:35:06
Even when the blood is your own
@_date: 2019-06-04 05:33:57
Lol, all this for $647 USD. What is wrong with this bank, get a life.
@_date: 2019-06-04 05:37:57
Nah, I'd rather crash the price so that I can buy more from you weak hands :)
@_date: 2019-08-19 03:48:36
In your estimate, what percentage of everyday people are using BTC over there? Use as either a store of value or currency to buy things with?
@_date: 2019-06-04 05:36:14
Strong dude. Strong.

My bank account where all my pay cheques go to is called 'Binance'. Is that considered reckless?
