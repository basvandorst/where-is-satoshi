Not necessarily true: euros are accepted in most EU countries but they are separate states non the less. Technically (hypothetically(!)) A country could easily collect tax via crypto, with smart contacts EMMIDIATLY actually as salaries and sales take place. 
They do like to print money tho, and they like stability (They print money FOR stability actually). But a stablecoin with smart contracts would be fine for a government, they could track and trace and tax you anywhere you go, a wet dream for any government. The fact that they cannot print money out of thin air just scares the fuck out of them, because it's all they've ever known (not going to mention sources but you what I mean, Google is your friend).

In my opinion, when 2008 happend, 2009 followed and saw an immediate 25% year or something like that. 
Collapses take only a few months to maximum a year, historically, while the build up to new heights take years.
While everyone felt that the collapse had an impact on their lives, up until 2012 maybe... stocks actually did great right after the sharp 2008 drop.
So, it could be bad for -some- months for crypto, just like stocks, but I think we will start a bullish trend quite quickly after the initial drop :)

I just checked and in the Ukraine 1 kwh is really .05 usd, so who wants to start a mining business with me :p ? According to whattomine it's profitable right now, just imagine if prices go a tad higher.
20 vega64's to start with ? I avoid asics as they tend to age quite fast with new releases while gfx cards (so asic resistant chains) hold value/ hash/s quite well.
