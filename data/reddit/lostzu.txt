Its already a fun conspiracy theory. I laughed out loud in real life. Then I thought, what if this isn't just some random troll on Wikipedia and leads to real info. Thats why I made the post.

Answers to my own questions.
Who is Ronald Y? Could be [this guy]( who "focuses his practice on complex technology and intellectual property transactions." which sounds like what we are talking about. Still not good enough for me. It is probably a fake name for a fake troll story.
Is there any real verification of any of this? No.
Who is Satoshi Nakamoto? We don't know for sure.
From [this article](
 In Japanese Satoshi translates into “clear-thinking; quick-witted; wise.” “Naka” can mean “inside” or “relationship” while “moto” is defined as “the origin; the cause; the foundation; the basis.” So we have “clear-thinking” “inside” “the foundation.” 
You can interpret that as a clear thinking person who has/had a relationship with the banking system. 
The Genesis block reads [EThe Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks.](
Banking insider or not, he created Bitcoin out of concern with the banking system.
Why has Satoshi Nakamoto remained anonymous? It would be extremely dangerous for him to reveal his identity.
Are KGB quantum computers mining quantum shitcoin forks? No.

You didn't answer any of the 4 serious questions I asked. Or laugh at my joke. So you are obviously not my core demographic.
