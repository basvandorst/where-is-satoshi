What are the fees, never used lightning network?  Say you want to buy a $50 game what's the fee you or the seller have to pay on $50?

Why should you care.  I have a really hard time believing people's value of this thing changes 5%, 10% hourly, 20% in a few hours consistently.
It's just a bunch of computers trading with inside info on the flows of orders made.  Myself and every other person I know into crypto don't even care that much.  Sure it's nice to look at your portfolio numbers go up but none of use are cashing out anytime soon, so we look at in passing and go meh.

Is every exchange still charging .001 bitcoins to withdraw?  
@_date: 2018-01-26 21:16:52
it really would have been perfect if doge came out at the end just strolling and not giving a F.

What's the transaction fee if I'm buying $10 of KFC with bitcoin at $14k or say 15k?
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:53:48
I feel it has to be coin like doge or byte with a lot in supply.  I don't want to buy an gpu for .00001 BTC I want to pay like a whole number like 45.5 doges or something lie that.

nothing humble about that

Ah the dumb fcks who trade on paper accounts.  Yes I was one dumb fck in High school trading on fun worthless paper accounts at one point.
Then I traded with real money in a real account, with real hours and wages that went into an IRA 401k and traditional accounts.  Yes I've traded on Gox, coinbase, binance too.  It's not black and white to say 90% is 90% to regular people when 90% migh be a house or 90% might a t shirt. 
In 2008 I didn't have much vested in the market so eventhough 50% was lost it was maybe a few months of work to reinvest that.  When coworkers were 50 years old with 2 kids in college, a mortgage, and a spouse to support 50% loss was earth shattering and some couldn't stomach it.  So in my situation it was like 10k for a single guy and 500k+ for someone  getting laid off, closer to retirement with a family to support.  Worlds different but yah 50% for both of us.

Don't get fooled by the volume

Another dumb fcking idiot.

What kind of bubble do you live in 2.8 million loss is way different from $28  even if both might be 90%.  I hope you're kidding, 90% might be 90% in terms of math, but mental and pyschological factors come in play at certain amounts.

maybe short gbtc on any stock exchange?

I bought like every coin in the top 30, for me doge is the cheapest to move around.  I'm a crypto supporter for everything, I'll even tell people positive things if they ask about crypto/btc but in my use btc is the slowest and definitely the most expensive, but I still believe in it. Hell most of the top 30 coins are the ones shilled the most, I bought them all on the chance that a few take off and I'll try to be positive about them all.

I know dogecoin gets sht on because it's a meme but it's fcking faster than btc and every transaction costs me 1 dogecoin so under a penny transaction cost.  If I need to move coins to another trading site if doge is an option I move it that way.  Moved many BTC worth of doge for 1 dogecoin fee.

Looks like it's easy, I got tired of sending it in and out of my wallet as I didn't trust btce back in the day.  I could fill a pool with tears at all the ones I sold in 2013

@_date: 2018-02-03 22:37:10
