I know. It was too late by the time I found out, but I was legally obliged to feed it.

You can make a feature on the cheap, but it will end up looking like it. Making a film is always expensive. You could exploit people to work for free, but good cast/crew don't work for nothing. There are always going to be editing and equipment costs. Just having mics is only one part of it, the sound mix is when things really come together and you need a dedicated professional to work on it. Bad sound will ruin a film. And if making a feature, you'll need insurance. You'll need clearance from locations.

Thank you! Glad you liked it. Hoping to get it shared and seen by as many people as possible. Lots of in jokes, but I reckon there's enough there for non-crypto types too!

Simpsons did it. Yeah, I've never seen that. There are always going to be commonalities to find in these things. As long as it's not straight up copying, or taking from someone else's material.

Fistbump on that one.

Of course there was Barrys.

Mostly ham / egg salad. But we had a vegan on set. That might have added a premium.

Ah, okay. Well, you can see who I am, and I'm happy to back it up.
Don't get tetchy. I'm not going to grin and nod when you're spouting nonsense. I'm honest enough to tell someone when they're blatantly wrong. If you don't realize that yourself that's on you. Either you're totally deluded or just young, with a lot to learn. You'll figure it out eventually, I'm sure. Likewise, wishing you the best.

Sorry :( I wanted an epic fight scene, and explosions, but I blew the budget on Sandwiches.

I've worked on feature films, I've been doing this for a while. If you know something I don't, absolutely, do share. Unless you mean shooting illegally, cutting corners, not paying a basic wage and exploiting other people to work for little or nothing?

Thanks man. The song is epic. Not original to the film, but very kindly provided by a group called Coin Bros. They have some other great content, highly recommend you check them out. 
I'd be inclined to agree with you regarding festivals. There are a small number that are genuinely worth it. I've learned to focus ONLY on those!

Wrong on all fronts. You're talking about amateur films. I'm a little past that at this stage. And regardless, funding is never easy, the amount of money simply changes in line with the scope of the project. I personally know Oscar winning film makers who struggle to get funding.

I'm not sure what you're talking about, but part of the rules around these festivals is that it can't be available online.

You can talk all you want but you are regurgitating nonsense. If you're going to make such bold claims, and if you are actually in "this business" yourself, you need to back it up. You haven't even given anecdotal evidence. And If you aren't in the business, why do you assume to know better than anyone else?

Cheers! Hope to have it ready to go after next week.
