Well I mean if someone was like what do you think about bitcoin's future I'd rather ask the programmer.  
If I had to figure out how bitcoin could be integrated into the U.S. system and how to politically do it, I'll ask Mrs. Clinton.

I figured this was selling something in the comments. These crypto places are just turning into, "come buy my stuff."
@_date: 2018-09-16 12:44:00
I mean right now yeah. 
 Maybe not in 50 years though,
"wow you owned a whole bitcoin grandpa? What was it like?"

The last person who said that provided me with a study from 1971 that actually showed TA worked pretty well if you don't include commissions and fees. I've never actually been given a study that shows TA is horrible compared to the market. 
So yeah I'm with , cite your sources or stfu. 
Also a 200MA is a momentum indicator not a price indicator. It will never tell you what the price will be only which way momentum is going. Most people in don't know how to us TA properly then bitch about it not working. It's always hilarious.

I have little sympathy for people if they're shocked later because they didn't take the time to read a document they signed their name on. It's not Congress there is no deadline for you to start up your account. It's not a EULA. It's not even long ffs.
Plus RH isn't going to lose any customers over this.

It's really hard to get across the value of a digital asset that offers security like bitcoin.  However I can always make people understand if i start talking about trust and their bank. They usually start nodding like,  "yeah screw my bank." then i know i have them. 
Then i sell them scentsy. jk. ;)

You're talking about moving above a 200 day average. Not some hourly or daily chart. It is a very powerful predictor and covers over half of a year. It something suddenly starts going over the average price of the last 200 days then there is already 200 days of momentum behind that trend. You can even see in the chart that it rarely crosses without continuation of the trend.
This is only one piece of a very large analytical puzzle but it is a rather cornerstone piece for many swing traders.
@_date: 2018-09-24 00:18:26
If the 200 crosses the 50 then math has gone awry.

That's it? An article from 1970? Alright let's have a read since it's slow at work today.
So they had different types of data. This is the *weak* form that is only price history so that would be price history charts.
So after they do the theory they [decide there is a correlation]( but it's not enough to make money from. They immediately say, "well we'd have to test it."
Then on the next page [they completely call you a liar]( and determine you can make quite a bit more money from intra-day trading models than buy-and-hold if you don't pay commissions. Thankfully Bitcoin commissions are also dirt cheap (I've always traded on cheap commissions anyway). I also trade on swing not intra-day so fees aren't really an issue.
Then they go on explain how semi-strong and strong form data can help further advance some traders but they're unrealistic to reality (almost no one has perfect *strong* form data, a.k.a insider trading).
[In conclusion they again say that weak-form trading]( is a money making endeavor, for those who charge the fees anyway. Thankfully it's 2018 and not 1970, we're talking about Bitcoin and not equities on the NYSE or NASDAQ, and trading fees are almost abolished entirely or pennies now. Again it's just another tool in the tool belt, nice to see my anecdotal evidence proven right though.


You want to try again with another study since this one refuted your last comment?

If you download IPFS you can get on DTube. It's not the same as youtube (just not enough people on it) but it hosts most of the trending videos if that's what you watch.

You made the claim it was worthless you have to back up your claim bud. I'll wait.

I'm not sure how people thought they were paying for the free trading scheme. They aren't displaying ads with every trade so there is only 1 or 2 other ways to generate revenue.

You can't buy any of it yourself unless your broker is in the NEOConnect group. Talk to your brokers if you want in.
@_date: 2018-09-24 16:37:03
Figured, never get anything back from people like you. Run off at the mouth and can't back it up and just blame the other person when they realize they're trapped and can't get out on their own arguments.
@_date: 2018-09-24 12:02:58
That rarely happens around a 200 day moving average, most movement is done far away from it. If it's around a 200 day and breaks through it's because momentum was already built up that way and it's probably a good trade. If you were talking about a 5/10 or 12/26 daily cross then I would agree with you, never ever buy on something like that because price fluctuations are too much and they're indicative of mood more than momentum. 
Also notice that not once have I used the word 'price' at all. These tools are momentum indicators not price indicators, watching people use them to figure out the price is hilarious because the chart realigns itself on the next step all the time.
It's okay, a lot of people use chart indicators without understanding anything about the pros/cons of each one and how they tie together the whole puzzle. You see it a lot in here.

US Presidential Candidate, Former Senator, Former Secretary of State, and Former First Lady. 
Yeah I'm going to say she's in a different league than an 80's programmer. At least outside of this subreddit, haha.
