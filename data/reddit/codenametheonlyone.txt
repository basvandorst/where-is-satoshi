If you think you can live 100% off bitcoin you are crazy. let alone live off it 3 years ago

Proxies could be used,  but wouldn't the ip become meaningless if enough people mined.

 Uses coin base output to make payment and would be fairly anonomus.

You could make your own alt coin. do the "points" need to have monetary value?

Kinda a bad metric because im having trouble finding info on number of lines of large projects. but i would think that we are dwarfed in comparrison to some major players. Oracle  has a market cap of 182B for example

Sure but show me where you can buy 200k in btc without going to an exchange. the question was about laundering it not storing it tho. I think that cash would be easier to launder.

Its just about impossible using "only bitcoin" but if you could trade that cash for bitcoin via a F2F transaction anonymously you could then claim that you where a early adopter and bought that BTC at fraction of the price. declare your gains to the IRS and pay taxes.it would be easy to prove that you bought the coins years ago (but you cant because you did not) and just about impossible to prove you did not if you mix the coins.
 But if i found 200K i would use a small amount to pay for monthly expenses while using my "clean money" to pay for say a mortgage you couldn't otherwise afford.
TLDR if i found 200K in cash i would keep it in cash if i wanted it to stay secret.
