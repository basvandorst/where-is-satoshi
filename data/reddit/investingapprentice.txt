I'm pretty adverse to waiting I'm afraid, after seeing how much I missed out on not following through back in September. Wished that I had actually gone so far as to set up and verify accounts back then though. :p

Bought at $7278 (£285 worth) after checking all day following being screwed out of the earlier price drop by a surprise CoinCorner verification process that locked my account back down, then of course it fell even lower. Gotta wait until tomorrow until I can put another £95 in. Can't wait until I have my Fire account sorted out and can buy proper amounts. On the plus side, adding this to my original Coinbase buy and I have 0.1 BTC. Now to multiply that a few times. :)

Someone on here told me to wait until Sunday night/Monday morning to buy... starting to regret following their advice rn. Thoughts?
@_date: 2017-11-03 22:05:14
Thanks for the answer, and the correction. I'm just annoyed that I've been beating myself up all week for not getting in sooner, and now that I finally have I'm still getting that same feeling.

Bitstamp: The connection gets reset whenever I try and submit my verification. :(  
  
Kraken: One of the accounts that I created, it isn't possible to buy BTC with GBP/EUR/USD on there though is it?

Bought in yesterday at $7400. I suppose I should be grateful that Coinbase limited me to £300 worth.
@_date: 2017-11-03 23:14:52
Just to check, this isn't a way to get around limits, just to avoid fees? My €6 SEPA to Coinbase for verification cost me £15 in fees, so it would be great to avoid that in future.

Thanks for the answer, don't worry, all my BTC is going straight onto a Ledger. How easy would it be for me (verification, limits etc.) to purchase BTC with a debit card on Gemini - SEPA payments aren't going well for me atm.
@_date: 2017-11-03 23:09:42
Don't worry, I'm not intending on tossing it all in straight away. Looks like I will just have to wait until after the weekend then (for SEPA verification payment/order).

I don't suppose you could tell me exactly how you are doing it, I get the message "Beneficiary is not allowed"?
@_date: 2017-11-05 17:56:36
I'm in the same boat, adds to the pain I'm feeling from missing out on 10x.
@_date: 2017-11-06 22:02:03
[Is this no longer accurate then?](  
  
I'm gonna be pretty annoyed if it isn't since I spent the past few days paying high fees on tiny debit-card-bought amounts of BTC. I am still limited to £250 a day on Revolut though so maybe it'll still work out if I can get in on the latest price drop.

My Fire account just got verified, and I was able to successfully send the money from Revolut to Fire - once the money arrives in my Fire account try paying Coinbase from there.   
  
I doubt that I have a limit on the amount I can put in my Coinbase EUR wallet, and due to my Revolut limit I'm only trying to send €563... to reply to your other commment, apparently some people get started on a lower Revolut limit than others for security reasons, and that limit is raised over time.  
  
Dip is still ongoing, gonna be annoyed if I miss it. :p

Hey, I'm in the same situation as you (saved £14k over first two years of working, if I'd put $500 of each paycheck into bitcoin instead of my bank account I would have invested $12k by now but made $124k) - currently trying to "empty into bitcoin" but I'm have problems with being verified on coinbase, cex.io etc. How did you go about doing it?
@_date: 2017-11-03 23:39:28
Oh no, how long is a while? I can't be waiting 40 days to get my Debit card limit raised.
@_date: 2017-11-04 01:00:48
I feel like they are charging more due to laxer verification processes. I think I'm gonna sleep on it and see what has and hasn't gone through in 12 hours.

GDAX deposit funds takes me to Coinbase, Coinbase GBP Wallet "deposit" is greyed out..
@_date: 2017-11-03 23:12:50
There's a bitcoin ATM somewhat near my workplace, hopefully I can have my wallet situation sorted tomorrow, then buy on Sunday when I'm back in work. :)  
  
I had already looked up ATM's, but I'm happy to see them suggested here since I was slightly concerned about using them. The one I would be using looks pretty reputable though.
@_date: 2017-11-05 12:13:42
Yeah, this thought comforts me slightly. But if I had put in $500 of each paycheck (two years) I would be 10x up, and already have most of my savings in BTC... instead of having £14k sitting doing fuck all. Always gonna be regret somewhere.  
  
Edit: Bitcoin could have also crashed and I'd have worked for two years and have zero savings so ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯.

Does the price historically dip then, or is that the timeframe that I should expect to be verified on Coinbase? My Coinbase verification relies on a SEPA payment, which hasn't appeared on my bank account yet (not even in pending), and I don't expect that will even clear until Tuesday.  
  
Based on the last few days, four days would be time enough to recover from the extra $800 (5% fee included) that I will be paying at Coinmama over trading price.
@_date: 2017-11-05 12:11:06
I did originally ignore it, but my payments were declined. Could have done it first thing the next morning though. As it was I would have still paid $74xx (Coinmama) so not too big of a loss *so far*... Hoping to sort out Revolut -&gt; Fire -&gt; GDAX in the next few days, shouldn't pay too much more and greedy Coinmama won't get my money.
@_date: 2017-11-03 21:59:41
That's where I originally signed up, does it not share Coinbase's limit?
@_date: 2017-11-04 15:36:04
What time zone are you going by? My bank account is finally making sense but I'm no closer to buying on any site apart from Coinmama (and bitpanda but $50 a day worth). Still just got my initial tiny Coinbase purchase (which I bought at exactly the wrong time when bitcoin was $74xx), but at least it is safe on a hardware wallet now.
