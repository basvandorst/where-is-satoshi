Seems to be a lot of people reassuring themselves and getting upvoted by others who hear only what they want to hear

It's definitely about price if you pour your "entire net worth" into Bitcoin and are "watching the price every day". Please, stop talking nonsense.

Serious cojones? You mean stupid as pigshit, right?
@_date: 2018-05-11 16:29:26
You mean almost every motherfucker in this subreddit? 
For every person here who believes in the revolutionary potential of bitcoin, there are 100,000 greedy fucks just wanting to get rich quick. But they'll tell themselves they're a part of the former group, because it feels good.

"hodl" can never be proven wrong though, which is the reason it pisses people off so much I think. There's no time frame for the life of Bitcoin, so you'll never be wrong by screaming "hodl" (even when it's awful advice) because there's always the *possibility* that it bounces back. That *possibility* is always present for as long as Bitcoin exists. You literally can't be proven wrong by saying "hodl".

It stressed him out. He didn't want that kind of thing in his life, to be always watching a number and caring so much about a number.

Just curious, how do you manage the flat in Budapest from afar? (Assuming you don't live there?)

For real. Some people around here sound like me during the throes of my gambling addiction a few years ago.

Why 3 months?
@_date: 2018-12-14 19:02:29
same shit applies to anyone proclaiming Bitcoin is gonna be worth a fuckton in the future
@_date: 2018-12-14 19:05:12
Wait, everybody's holding out for the 40-50 year mark? Well fuck, everybody here is gonna be around 70 years old by that stage! and a good few will have clocked out early

How long are you holding **for**? Does everyone who repeats the hodl mantra have a specific number in mind or what?

People here absolutely took him seriously when he was reinforcing their hopes that Bitcoin would hit an astronomical price
@_date: 2018-12-10 23:54:39
Even if that comes to pass, it doesn't seem like it will happen in our lifetime. And if it does, we're banking on Bitcoin being the chosen crypto.

Teach me your ways, sensei
No seriously, what did you learn and how did you "get it down"?
@_date: 2018-12-14 23:09:18
So you agree then
@_date: 2018-12-06 20:48:55
Did you buy much?
@_date: 2018-12-10 15:50:01
It's the same for literally any public figure. If they say something that predicts a huge price increase, the people here whoop and holler. If the same person ever backtracks, suddenly they're a buffoon, a has-been, an old fool, etc. 
That's literally all this sub is. People trying to reinforce their hopes for the future by selectively choosing who to believe based purely on how positive they are. It's like a gambling addict reasoning with himself.
