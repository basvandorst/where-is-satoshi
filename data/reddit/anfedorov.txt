The "he did it first" argument doesn't even fly in first grade. Publically offering $1M bounties to people to prove that you signed a contract that you don't remember signing? This is not a good way to do business.

Well, it looks like by the time he finished buying the last batch, the price was almost 20% down from the first one. Does that mean you suggest cashing out if it goes back to the price he bought it at? :)
@_date: 2015-05-26 18:41:21
Interesting, thanks for providing the background.
The public shaming/bounty-ing seems crazy to me because our society has for some time now had systems to deter this kind of behavior and streamline business dealings. Had they used a notary, forging the signature and seal would have been a crime that the state prosecuted them for. IANAL, but it seems there is also a civil cases to be pursued for libel.
Seeing this makes crypto-anarchy seems like such a step back. Given this example, why should anyone choose digital signatures over paying $20 for a notary to execute a contract? I say this realizing that digital signatures are cheaper and arguably more reliable.
@_date: 2015-05-26 07:38:18


Doing the opposite how?
I certainly look forward to a future where everyone's laptop is secure and we all use crypto signatures for everything, but when there's a public argument about "forged" crypto-signatures, it shows that we're not even close to being there yet.
Long lesson short here: if you want to sign a contract with significant legal ramifications, get it notarized. It's significantly more expensive compared to digital signatures, but it's a hell of a lot cheaper than having your name associated with these kinds of public disputes.

I'm not sure what you mean by "stooped to the point of sending letters", but how I understood what happened is that serious criminals (the kind the FBI spends significant resources investigating) were using prepaid credit cards bought with cash, not because they got tired of issuing subpoenas.
Coinbase is tied to your bank account if you cash out, and to your IP as soon as you log in. If you're running a business LE would be interested in persecuting, Coinbase is a terrible choice.
If you're just looking to accept payments that violate PayPal's or Square's TOS, however, Coinbase is a great alternative.

The origins of Bitcoin are indeed very interesting to speculate about. Personally, I like to imagine it was a team at the NSA :)
As far as how BTC are created, it's not difficult to understand at all, I don't think. The article you link to is just a horrible explanation. The history of bitcoin transactions is maintained in the blockchain, created and agreed upon by a p2p network. The rules this network follows are such that for every block, the creator of that block may include a transaction with 50 bitcoins going out to account(s) of their choice, without any going in. It's simply a rule programmed into all of the peers which maintain the books for bitcoin accounts.
@_date: 2012-06-22 04:55:46


That sounds exaggerated. Do you have a source?
Either way, re-read my point: it was that trojan-less machines is a level technical maturity we're *pretty close* to reaching (on PC's (and have already reached on iOS)).


What do you mean by "predetermined address only"? An OTP authenticates you to the third party to signs outgoing transactions. As soon as grandma enters her OTP into a compromised machine, what exactly is stopping the attacker from using it to authenticate a transaction sending him all of her bitcoins?
@_date: 2012-07-20 22:12:17


Thanks for trying it out! Good call about the address not fitting. I think could use a little more width in other parts of the UI, as well.
@_date: 2012-06-21 20:28:00
An OTP doesn't help you if you're entering it into a compromised machine. I know how multikey works, but how do you authenticate with the third party? If it's through a compromised machine, an attacker can still steal your Bitcoins.
The solution is not to have trojans on grandma's machine. I think this is a level of technical maturing we're pretty close to reaching...

Are you serious? I write the extension that does the math that actually creates an account. It's open source, so anyone can double check that I'm not doing anything shady. You run it and create the account.
@_date: 2012-07-21 01:41:44


Yup! That's why when you install it, it requests to "Access all your data, on all websites". It's signed by Google, though, so it probably won't send them your banking password (unless it tries to define it ;)).


I'll definitely support that in the Options, but would rather not make it the default.


That seems like a generally good idea when dealing with software like Chrome extensions. That said, I'd like to do my best to keep things secure (e.g. not send bitcoins to an address just because another extension asked me to with no verification). I'm pretty sure I've thought of a decent security mechanism, though. You'll see it soon!

Now that I've tried it instead of talking out of my ass, easywallet.org seems to offer a service close to being usable. One could make the UI a bit less webpage-y and more app-like, and also offer an actual wallet (with multiple accounts, account labels, etc) instead of just one address.

This is most certainly FUD, but it's founded in truth: Bitcoin gives its users a level of freedom that isn't available anywhere else, a level of freedom which is incompatible with our current system of laws and regulations in regard to money laundering, etc.

The other two probably didn't have any fees attached to them, and so took a longer time to be included in the blockchain. Whenever a miner creates a block, they can include whatever transactions they want, and claim the fees associated with those transactions. Hence, some miners will ignore transactions without fees.

Not at an exchange, as PayPal transactions can be reversed, while Bitcoin transactions can't.

Well, there might not be a technical solution, but there's certainly a legal one – in this case, double spending is bank fraud, and is debugged &amp; fixed by the FBI.
It's worth noting that Bitcoin has no solution for double spend in the case where a transaction needs to be verified in real time, either, and the solution Bitcoin uses wouldn't work for their use case. I don't think many people would use an ATM which took a random amount of time with an average of an hour to verify they weren't double spending before giving them their cash.

The certificate itself doesn't expire until December 16th, but the certificate used to issue it expired last week (Oct 22nd, 2012).
EDIT: the above is according to Chrome on OSX. In FF on OSX, the issuing certificate is supposed to expire on the same date in 2017. Both browsers agree on the SHA1 fingerprint being 1B DB AA 0A C1 C3 CC 46 4D 8E DA D5 68 70 C4 01 DC 03 5E E7. I'm not sure how this can be possible.

At least on OS X, browsers like Safari &amp; Chrome don't come with certificates, but use the ones provided by the OS, so updating the browser won't help. Either way, those are root certificates, not intermediate ones. Intermediate certificates are either sent by the server or downloaded from a location provided by the server. According to what Chrome tells me, the intermediate certificate used to issue the bitcoin.it one is legitimately issued by the StartCom root certificate, but is simply expired.
If the certificate it's sending you is issued by an intermediate one that expires in 2017, then bitcoin.it is sending you a different certificate than it is sending me.
EDIT: I was wrong about the last part. When I visit the site in Firefox, it send the same certificate (according to the SHA1 fingerprint), but with an intermediate cert which expires in 2017. I'm stumped. I didn't think that was possible, unless there's some bug in Firefox...

It definitely does. I've actually thought about several UI's which could be triggered by doubleclick/select. My reason for not including it in this extension is that it would have to request JS injection onto all pages, and that's something security-conscious users shouldn't do. I'd be willing to do it for a separate extension, though, so people have the choice to install it separately.
While I'm definitely a fan of allowing you do customize it however you want in the settings, the favorite UI I've mocked up is double clicking to select (just like without the extension), and then, if a valid address is selected, overlaying an icon which has an onhover menu to send bitcoins/tip/add to address book/etc. I hadn't thought about quick-tip, but I find the "tips should be fast and simple" argument very appealing. Perhaps a keyboard shortcut is a nice solution? You'd double click (to select), then hit &lt;t&gt; to send a tip. Or perhaps &lt;t&gt; to open the menu and select "tip", and &lt;enter&gt; to confirm (with an auto-confirm in 1s?).
A reddit-specific extension could allow you to tip everyone you upvote, or maybe tip if you hold &lt;shift&gt; or &lt;ctrl&gt; as you upvote. I need to think about how to do this without allowing evil extensions to steal all of your bitcoins, though.
Do either of those sound appealing?

It's hard to argue about what malware trends will look like in the future, but I think it's safe to say it's getting harder (and more expensive) to infect machines compared to just a few years ago. Flashback used a Java vulnerability, which (probably) wouldn't work if the user were using Chrome, which [warns the user]( before loading an applet. In part because of such vulnerabilities, Java is [being deprecated]( in the near future. The 600k infections are a scary number, but in 2012 constitute (probably) less than 0.5% of the [total number of OS X users]( As Java and Flash are replaced with HTML5, the attack surface on OS X machines is going to get smaller still.


I think you're talking about a passive attacker, while I'm thinking of an active one ([the difference]( As soon as you enter an OTP into a compromised machine, the attacker controls what it's used for.
Unless you're talking about something more than kind of OTP I know of, consider this scenario:
* Grandma requests to send coins to kdoto for his cakeday using her compromised computer.
* The attacker stops that request from going out and instead requests her life savings to be sent to him.
* She provides an OTP from her (time-synchronized?) OTP generator, thinking she's verifying her transaction (which never went out).
* The attacker uses that OTP to authenticate his transaction.
* The attacker gets all of grandma's bitcoins :(
The solution is to not use infected computers, and to verify authentication using multiple independent devices in case one gets infected. This is why cell phones are starting to sync/update themselves over wifi. If you're constantly plugging your phone into a machine which can push updates, it's no longer independent, and makes sophisticated attacks using both devices possible.
I'm not sure about Gavin's ideas because I actually haven't read anything by him (could you link to them?), but I think the best solution I've seen among the community is to store private keys to accounts with large sums of bitcoins offline (perhaps on specialized hardware) and kept physically secure, and make sure the amount of bitcoins stored on your day-to-day internet-connected devices comprable to the cash you carry in your wallet, i.e. worth less than the (increasing) cost of infecting them with malware.

You don't really need a top-notch security expert. You just need to keep the majority of your bitcoins offline, and be public that you are doing so. The disastrous security breaches we've seen weren't caused by a lack of top-notch expertise, but by blatant incompetence.

I think he might have meant importing an encrypted seed in the UI (my client supports exporting seeds without decrypting them). IIRC, when you export an encrypted seed, 0.6 asks for the password and decrypts it for you.
@_date: 2012-09-03 00:36:15
Just use simpler words (e.g. coins instead of crypto-currency). Bitcoin is a system which keeps track of virtual coins, accounts which contain them, and transactions between those, without relying on a central authority like a bank or PayPal or a government.
@_date: 2012-07-17 13:13:11
Blockchain.info's wallet isn't really an "online wallet" in the sense that it manages your private keys for you (e.g. like Coinbase does). Blockchain.info stores an encrypted backup of your wallet, but only you have access to the passphrase for decryption. Everything to do with your private keys is done in JS on the client ("offline").
@_date: 2012-08-24 21:31:53
The Electrum client supports encrypting seeds internally, but you can't import/export an encrypted seed via the UI without first decrypting it. The encryption used in the Chrome Extension is identical, however, so you should be able to paste an encrypted seed into your ~/.electrum/electrum.dat file and have it work. You could also go into the options page (right click the icon), decrypt the seed, copy/paste, and re-encrypt.

Well, the extension could automatically claim the bitcoins sent to you, if you choose to install it. I could even make a smaller extension that does just that (provided an address to forward tips to), if you don't want to install the full-featured one.
A sender would still have access to the intermediary account, so if the recipient doesn't claim the bitcoins, the sender can always take them back. The extension could definitely do this automatically after 90 days (good idea!).
I'm open to the idea of making an external service, but I'm not sure if I fully understand what you're saying. Would it be a separate website? How would you connect to it through your reddit account?

I think OTC is a great proof of concept, but nearly impossible to use, especially for someone without a technical background. Bitcoinary is an enormous improvement, but not completely ideal yet, either.
There's a general "trust" problem for various retailers on the internet which has been solved by different businesses in different ways (e.g. Ebay, Amazon, Airbnb, etc.). I think an aggregator will come about to solve this general problem, at which point running a Bitcoin exchange will become a lot easier.

I usually don't donate to Open Source software either, but since I use RES all the time, and since sending a Bitcoin takes about 5 seconds, it seems worth it! :)
@_date: 2012-06-22 13:58:59
Yup, neat!

I think acquiring bitcoins is by far the hardest part of using them right now (and a very interesting problem to solve!). If you're in the US, you can use Bank Account-&gt;Dwolla-&gt;Exchange, but the first arrow takes several days to process.

No news, I got distracted by other things :(
I'll try to get to it this weekend, though. Will ping you if I do.

Privacy with Bitcoins is a pretty big thing that I've tried to ignore, but you're right that it's a feature some people will need. Since keeping transactions private is kind of a big deal sometimes, this is an especially tough problem... the cost of making a mistake is high. I'm tempted to just say "if you care about privacy, this shouldn't be your only wallet - don't use it to gather donations associated with your public identity to then go on a Silk Road shopping spree", but I'm still rather on the edge about it. I'll consider adding multiple wallets, but I need to think it over quite a bit more.

Most of this article is accurate, but considering that all bets and winnings are public, Satoshi Dice would make a *really* crappy mixer.
@_date: 2012-08-22 05:53:20
If I had ~$5 million worth of Bitcoins that people gave to me without knowing who I was, I can't honestly say I'd be very tempted to give them back, either...
@_date: 2012-06-03 02:45:18
Got it, thanks!

There's quite a bit more to be found out about him through some dedicated Googling. Trendon Shavers is either his real name or a thoroughly constructed identity.
@_date: 2012-08-11 17:15:48


Yes there is, by analyzing where bitcoins go, and giving law enforcement access to accounts tied to real names (mtgox, etc.).

There is a [FriendlyPay app]( available in the US AppStore which lets you manage a Bitcoin wallet on your iPhone. Given this news, I'm not sure if it will last, though...
AppStore aside, there's no reason why a Bitcoin wallet can't be implemented as an HTML5 app... there seem to be a [couple of them]( already, but none that I'd say are usable enough. Get coding!
@_date: 2012-08-11 15:08:48
They don't need to convince the public, lawmakers are enough. The public at large doesn't know or care about Bitcoin.
@_date: 2012-06-21 19:20:43
Can you expound? I'm having a hard time seeing how multikey can help if you've got a trojan on your computer. Even if the 3rd party calls your phone every time you make a transaction, [you could get hacked]( and with bitcoins of course, there's no reversing the transaction!
@_date: 2012-08-28 23:33:39
Does anyone know the sources behind the rumored 500k BTC he was holding? I have trouble believing that so many people are so gullible...

When you tip someone, you create a new account I don't have access to and deposit the money there. You then give access to the account to the recipient via a reddit message. Only the sender, receiver, and reddit can withdraw from that account.

I think the kind of hackers that steal bitcoins are in it for the bitcoins, not the challenge. Also, it's quite a challenge, especially if you're hacking from Eastern Europe or Asia. The only vulnerabilities I can imagine are from how the private keys are accessed/used, but I imagine the coinbase guys are smart about that, as well.
@_date: 2013-05-01 07:32:49


That's a bit strong. What do you find objectionable about it?
@_date: 2013-02-24 22:03:12
Uh... so you trusted a stranger on the internet to hold on to $1,200 for you, and then they told you it got stolen?
You have one option: take a deep breath, say "well, that blows", and learn from your mistakes. It might seem like a lot of money when you're young, but $1,200 isn't much compared to what some people lose by trusting [people they shouldn't](
@_date: 2013-02-25 18:37:53
Right. I'd have agreed if he said "Trust No One anonymous on the internet", which is a bit of a more conservative statement.

What's a "hard networking rule"? Nodes can be updated.
@_date: 2013-05-31 00:49:50


What's not easy? I think there already is widespread consensus that the the block size will need to increase if Bitcoin keeps growing. It's kind of a no-brainer.
To be backwards compatible, you need two updates: First update accepts bigger blocks, and after *most* (not all) of the nodes have updated, second update start generating X MB blocks.
@_date: 2013-05-31 02:08:16
That's a pointless semantic distinction. Current miners won't work on the future networks, just like old miners wouldn't be compatible with today's network.
There is absolutely no practical need to maintain backwards compatibility across multiple updates. The block size the networks accepts can be increased with no single point in time when every miner has to switch to a new version, but with a gradual roll-out that won't fork the blockchain, just like a dozen or so updates the network has gone through already.
@_date: 2013-06-01 09:09:00
Ah, thanks for clarifying. That makes sense.
What do non-mining peers do? Do they just forward txs to other nodes on the network?
@_date: 2013-04-05 16:01:24
FWIW, looks like the public page I made weeks ago wasn't scraped, probably because I didn't post it anywhere: 
@_date: 2013-05-18 18:11:26
You don't need to publish papers on elliptic curve math to be able to implement ECDSA. The mathematics behind crypto and crypto system design are very different skill sets.
@_date: 2013-05-29 16:14:21
Sure, why not? Most of the current miners wouldn't participate, because it would take significant investment to run a mine, but the payment fees would add up to significant profits, as well, so there would certainly be an incentive to mine.
@_date: 2013-05-29 07:53:31
51% attacks become less feasible as the networks grows, and are only worthwhile if you want to double-spend a large transaction. If you're accepting large transactions, they are easily defeated by waiting a couple of hours for a higher confirmation number.
Unless I'm misunderstanding something, block size can be increased in a backwards-compatible way as it becomes necessary.
@_date: 2013-05-31 18:11:39
What's a hard fork? Who else needs to upgrade? The top result on google for it is an article about how [one happened earlier this month](
@_date: 2013-02-24 22:06:16
Bitcoins are a lot like cash. You shouldn't trust a stranger on the internet to hold on to them for you, but you shouldn't keep all your BTC on your personal machine all the time, either.
@_date: 2013-02-24 22:11:38


That's insane. If you want someone to hold on to $1,200 for you, there are quite a few institutions which are trustworthy enough to do it without losing much sleep over it.

Stop being an idiot. Did you even look at the URL? These are checkouts. The pages are created when you turn on the merchant tool of having a checkout page. What would the point of a non-public checkout page be?

Google hasn't indexed mine, and it's been up for weeks: 
EDIT: just checked, and perhaps it's because I didn't check "Show my company in the public merchant directory"?

Yes.
