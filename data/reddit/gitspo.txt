|Afaik you might get listed there if you use an older ElectrumX server version which relays the phishing servers to Electrum wallet clients.This post is a few months old already, but it kinda sounds like an automated process:  first thing would make sure you use a recent version of ElectrumX server (maybe something like 1.10.x or higher) and then maybe it fixes itself(?. not sure but it&amp; possible)|["at 2019-05-09 21:54")                                                     |

|[..] few months back...A little background (you may know already but for context): ABC stands for Adjustable Blocksize Cap. I used to think it was not user adjustable because the release notes [  ] for v0.17.0 used the phrase &amp;quot;Increase the maximum blocksize to 32,000,000 bytes,&amp;quot; which sounds like an actual protocol update is needed to increase it.
