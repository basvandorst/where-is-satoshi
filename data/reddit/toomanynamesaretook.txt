If you want to day trade Bitcoin or trade Bitcoin in general for profit you goto an exchange; **it has the liquidity** and you can execute trades **quickly and promptly.** 
Local Bitcoins is the opposite of that. Only an absolute idiot would trade Bitcoin for profit on Localbitcoins, unless they generate profit via providing liquidity to the market place; i.e profiting off of the margins. That however is very different to actively trading the underlying asset. It's profiting off of inefficencies in the market place. 


Logical deduction, assumption and from personal experience trading Bitcoin.

Whilst there is plenty of good logic involved in the criticism of Gavin's proposal it falls flat to one main reason: it presumes an idealistic place where everyone is going to come together and agree. Look at any system of governance, there is never an absolute majority. It presumes that there will exist a proposal which will not have detractors, essentially it proposes the impossible. 
There already exists a substantial majority which wants to see an increase in the blocksize to facilitate a higher TPS; forgoing any technical roadblocks which are dire I see little reason against it. In any democratic governmental system over 75% would be considered a super majority, Gavin is hardly bending the rules semantically or logically. 
It is sad to see a lot of people avoiding the debate by simply yelling simplistic statements or implying vested interest. This is a debate which needs to happen, it's just foolish to presume we will ever reach a greater than 90% consensus.

They are suggesting that you use the order books (a list of buyers and sellers) to gauge institutional intention. 
I think this is silly. Doubly so as the order books are not substantiating that persons perspective anyway.  For example on Bitfinex currently there are 3700 BTC to be bought to 440 USD. On the sell side there is 5700 BTC to 480 USD to be sold. There are more sellers than buyers going by this sole metric. 
@_date: 2015-12-11 20:25:31

Great plan. 
If you like motorbikes I'd without a doubt recommend doing 'the loop' near Thakek in Laos; extremely beautiful, one of the most scenic rides I've been on. I only made it 1/3 the way though, hit a piglet going about 60kmph without a helmet in no gear like an idiot on a scooter (over confident from riding my GSXR all over New Zealand and too relaxed from being in SEA.) Luckily for me I came out of it relatively alright (cuts, grazes, a few stitches and a broken collarbone) considering I could have just easily killed myself. 
Give a lot of caution to livestock on the road, they can seem extremely calm and then instantaneously change their mind and run directly into your path with great haste.

Whilst you're right in pointing out that the Germans may have won a quick victory at Stalingrad if they hadn't bombed it prior to sending in their armor the reason they lost was entirely different... 
The Russians launched a deep penetrative armored pincer movement encircling the Germans... The Japanese had no armor or mechanised forces to speak of late in the war. 
To argue that the Japanese could mount such an offensive flies in the face of virtually everything from logistics, equipment and tactical ability. 
@_date: 2014-05-18 06:11:38


How would have they accomplished that whilst the United States was bombing the Japanese home islands constantly and without hindrance? By this stage the US was using the B-29 at high altitudes far out of the range of Japanese fighters and anti-air guns combined with reliable bomb sites which gave a decent hit-percentage on target. 
Japan was powerless to stop the juggernaut; which is why they started employing kamikaze attacks as they were out of options.

OP, articulate what exactly it is you're afraid of. I have spent months attempting to define what exactly US of A coin or JP coin would look like but keep coming up with nothing... 
The fact that there are no alternatives speaks volumes. Bitcoin is independent, open source and agnostic about who uses it which are important characteristics. Once you centralize, require individuals to register and restrict the use of the protocol you all of a sudden have something with a lot less utility. 
So again, let me know what exactly you're worried about, not a general theme without definition.

Financial regulation generally stops people from interacting with financial institutions and individuals... With Bitcoin you cannot stop any transaction, put a hold on an account or seize funds so in that respect regulation is entirely useless. 
The only thing regulation would do is make interaction with exchanges and other similar entities more 'traditional.' Meaning that you would register as if you were creating a bank account... Which has already happened for the main exchanges.

I don't see what you're proposing happening, namely because moving BTC off of Mt.Gox would be a trickle and secondly, the price of Mt.Gox will shortly overtake Bitstamp once people can move funds off of the exchange via BTC which destroys the arbitrage argument which had little merit already due to the inability to move BTC off of Mt.Gox.

Are you a trader? If so I find it surprising that you're unaware of the link between declining volatility and narrowing of the range with the decline in volume? 
Look at the D3 candlesticks of the past 6 months, look at the relationship between the large swings and the volume; compare that to the past 3-4 weeks where we have entered a narrow trading range... The large trend lines are converging (bear trend since December Vs pre-bubble support) which soon enough will result in a breakout which will mean larger volume. 
Also, I would take into account the large transfers of fiat &lt;&gt; BTC carried out off the exchanges (i.e Secondmarket) which accounts for over 100,000 BTC (Secondmarket alone) at the time of writing.

The problem with your argument is that it simply isn't true. Bitcoin has many advantages over Dogecoin and none of them have to do with the protocol. All of the venture capital money is invested in Bitcoin, all of the businesses, ATMs, merchants and fiat &lt;&gt; crypto facilitators are integrating with the Bitcoin network. That is what gives it worth, not the people posting on reddit arguing over the community values. Dogecoin has no underlying infrastructure that Bitcoin has therefore little real world use - just think of how you move fiat into and out of DOGE...
I am cryptocurrency agnostic, I will bet on the winning horse regardless of what people think about it. If the day comes that I don't have to buy Bitcoin to buy Doge in a manner comparable to Bitcoin I'll take it seriously. Not that I have anything wrong with DOGE being used as it is... I'm simply talking from an investment perspective.

You should read what I said again, I'm not taking issue with you saying it is unlikely to work, I take issue with you saying it won't work. 


Ideas like this make me think you don't really understand what Bitcoin is or what it can become. Just because lots of libertarians on make ridiculous statements about Bitcoin taking over the world does not make it so. 
I'd recommend listening to the technologists and venture capitalists when it comes to Bitcoin as they actually understand the implications of the technology. Or do you think they are investing more into Bitcoin than they did the internet on a comparable timeframe for shits and giggles? It is the same names which developed the Internet which are now involved in Bitcoin. 


The unit of account is the least interesting part of Bitcoin yet it is the part which everybody focuses on. If that all Bitcoin was you'd be right... But that component pales in comparison to the transactional network and what the implications of that network are. 
Listen to Marc Andresson, read what Wedbush and BOA said in their reports on the technology. They don't focus on the unit of account, because it's largely irrelevant to the business end of Bitcoin.

You're right and I apologize. It's just that generally speaking you hear such arguments from individuals which are not able to substantiate their point of view and it is far simpler to make a cheap gibe and presume they're being ignorant. 




Sure. Are you familiar with the Melian dialogue? It is between an envoy of Athens and a small island state off the coast. 


Without state protection it is simply might makes right and any and all powers without equal will simply take what they wish. The modern western state is essentially the lesser of two evils, providing a safety blanket for individuals to exist and to have all of the comforts and rights that come with that. 
Whilst I personally detest the nation state and loathe much of modern society I appreciate the reality of its absence for without it you simply have perpetual conquest amongst various groups. 
If I am wrong feel free to point out an instance throughout human history where might makes right isn't a truism.

Thought exercise. 
If we were to print out a private key with a 3D printer in a manner akin to braille (therefore perceptible to touch) and the blockchain was infact still alive &amp; well. Is that not tangible? I would argue that it is. 
Given that the blockchain exists and is operational that private key is tangible given you make it physical. Yes there are multiple layers of abstraction at play here yet the private keys are very much real and useful given that the blockchain is operating as it should.

According to mainstream economics Bitcoin should have died in 2009 along with the white paper... Yet it hasn't, the complete opposite of what numerous economists have prophecised since its inception has transpired. 
Until that gap can be bridged I personally won't give much credence to Keynesian economic philosophy; nor should many around here. If your theory has no empirical basis it does not deserve much respect. 
@_date: 2014-02-12 11:24:44
I agree with a lot of what you're saying and a few of your criticisms are valid. 
Yet where we differ is that I don't believe any of the problems are inherent to cryptocurrency, they're simply the result of an immature and undeveloped technology. Bitcoin is still very far away from mainstream adoption due to the technical skill required to interact with the technology, the questionable exchanges, the uncertainty in regards to the legality. Yet all of these can be solved and is exactly what tens of millions of VC money, entrepreneurs and technologists are working on solving. Moreover, if you took the time to watch the New York regulatory hearings you would find much to be optimistic about in regards to the legality. 


Why do you think I am talking about price? Obviously that isn't a good argument to make. I am talking about the number of transactions conducted over the network, the number of new wallets being added on services like Coinbase &amp; Blockchain and the number of merchants added daily amongst other things which contribute to the utility and therefore worth of the network. 


How exactly?

@_date: 2014-01-29 03:47:55
Indeed. I am very idealistic when it comes to liberty, freedom and all those good things but some of the comments around here are ridiculous. 
People that talk about Bitcoin being able to hit 10,000, 100,000 USD are all making such statements on the presumption that Bitcoin is widely accepted and used. Without regulation we cannot have professional exchanges in places like New York &amp; London which will allow proper liquidity in the market for Bitcoin to grow. Without regulation large companies won't be able to accept or use Bitcoin... 
And again, none of it infringes upon the underlying technology so I cannot see the problem at all.

Your entire plan is entirely conditional on exchanges allowing you to deposit 1/2/3/4/50,000 + BTC on their exchanges without everyone following the blockchain and figuring out what is going on / exchanges banning your accounts.

US military planners were expecting to lose over a million men taking the Japanese home islands but they would have taken them regardless... Just would have lost a lot of marines. 
Compare the industrial output at the time, compare the number of troops, compare the K:D ratio in the pacific theater. It wouldn't have been a Pyrrhic victory, it would have been a costly one but the victor would be very clear. 
Moreso considering Russia wouldn't have given a shit about losses and would be racing the United States to take as much territory as possible hastening Japans demise.

Not the most popular opinion on but I am cryptocurrency agnostic; meaning I'll simply bet on the winning horse. As it currently stands I see no competition to Bitcoins dominance, yes Dogecoin will grow larger yet it has no VC funding, no large exchanges, hardly any merchants and little credibility amongst serious financial professionals. Bitcoin has the dominant network, it is this network which gives Bitcoin utility and therefore value. 
I only have two serious woes. A) Protocol failure which is serious (i.e private keys are no longer private.) B) Obama declares Bitcoin linked to terrorism. 
Without such an issue I am nothing but extremely bullish on the idea of cryptocurrency, Bitcoin being the dominant protocol without a serious contender to the throne. 
fyi %80 of my holdings are in BTC, the remainder in LTC &amp; DOGE which I simply hold to acquire more BTC.

Well that and not wanting to piss away tens of millions (or is it hundreds now?) of dollars in capital investments for little return. Carrying out such attacks undermines the network absolutely and essentially devalues everything as the network is no longer secure and hence is worthless. 
Which is why I have always found that perspective to be completely without merit; it only makes sense if one is illogical and or an idiot, generally someone with substantial capital is not. Then again, I understand wanting to design a system which does away with such an attack entirely. Still, sounds alarmist and or emotive what you're putting forth imo.

This has absolutely nothing to do with Bitstamp and everything to do with you. 
Bitstamp has no control over the amount of liquidity in the exchange. Attempting a 'instant order' when there are no bids and asks at the price you desire is idiotic. Limit order is what you should always use. Look at the order books, figure out what is and isn't possible. Bitstamp is not there to hold your hand in the big wide world.

Sorry but the author of this article is an absolute idiot. Let me explain why. The following is the entire basis of his argument: 


Which apparently implies: 


Why is this interpretation inherently flawed? Because the author has no idea what the term **agnostic** means. Agnosticism implies a neutral position; it is a position of **ignorance.** It is not taking a stance one way or another. 
The report from RAND details potential ways by which one could **potentially** attack a blockchain network. It also details it's capabilities and the implications of those. It is meant to be used to understand the technology from the position of the intelligence-military community. **None of which is actively suggesting this as a course of action.** 
The authors argument would be akin to taking a medical textbook detailing heart failure and implying that the author wants to give people heart failures because it explains the mechanism which causes it, what it is and all other related factors. 
RAND is a think tank which deals with various issues all related to the intelligence and military sector. I love reading their reports, they are all very interesting, detailed and go through various scenarios fully exploring the concepts and ideas. For example they also write up theoretical engagements between Taiwan and the United States against China. Does this mean that there is going to be a war? No. It's just a theoretical, rationale and in-depth discussion over the topic. 
Moreover, the US military and intelligence community could most definitely benefit from the use of Bitcoin; think of nefarious activities, black ops, CIA coups et al... Bitcoin can most definitely be used by the US government in a myriad of ways, [none of which impinge upon their sovereignty despite what many of you may think.

@_date: 2015-04-22 15:19:30
That is a mute point as anyone and everybody could have mined if they so wanted, fact of the matter is that virtually nobody gave the idea any credence and didn't take it seriously. 
Instamined is an intentional allocation of the underlying to futher the interests of the creators. Most of the coins mined in the early days of Bitcoin haven't moved for a very long time too which further undermines your point. 
@_date: 2015-04-30 15:48:23
I just did but as I expected it added very little. Your entire premise is that Warren Buffet had some involvement in this deal because he owns less than 3% interest in Goldman Sachs. 
**He has no ownership or control over this organisation.** Goldman Sachs made the decision to invest in Circle. How you draw any kind of connections there is beyond me... It makes absolutely no sense at all.

The problem is that it's virtually never reasoned criticism when one is having a 'discussion' with someone from or when they spill over here. They start from the presumption that a) Bitcoin is inherently useless and b) virtually any information pertaining to Bitcoin in a positive light is flawed. 
From years of debating such people it is never an honest debate, they have made a conclusion and look for information to support their presumption. Now obviously a large proportion of falls under this same flawed way of thinking which is just as bad and where a lot of the legitimate mockery of comes from. 
Nevertheless, I see the zealots of in the same light as the zealots of presumptuous, ignorant and unwilling to even see the possibility that the opposite side might be right. The extremes of both sides are akin to religious nutjobs.

I use it, best thing I ever did. It really is a great piece of software. Completely customizable and modular. It is also pretty damn cheap considering what you get...
My only concern is the delay sometime between an order being completed and the accurate representation of funds within the client (and hence the ability to place a second order quickly) - this is only a problem if you're making rapid trades however. 
In regards to safety - on Bitstamp at least when you set up your API you can remove the ability to withdraw funds via the API so there really is no risk factor.

I use Bitcoinparanoid at the moment but I really do not like the simplistic alarm - you are restricted to percentage points which is just a pain in the ass considering there is a jump between %1 and %3 which in dollar terms is very different! %1 is too sensitive and %3 is far too large a range.

Bitcoin is a global payment system; a means to store and transfer wealth at very little cost without the need for an intermediary. That alone is worth a lot, what will grow upon that system is what will decide its worth on top of that.

Good work on starting some excellent dialogue in this thread - have gone over everything thus far so I'll give you my perspective. 
Being realistic about it, no large company is going to roll out Bitcoin POS at this stage in the game - too much risk, not enough verifiable reward with too many unknowns. Moreso because third parties like Bitpay are outside of the equation as they would want to conduct such processes in-house... Which means they would require their own accounts on exchanges, their own traders (or software to conduct trades) and their own processes for risk management in regards to volatility. 
So considering the above, your best argument I believe is aiming for online integration - this however does require the aforementioned processes to mitigate risk in regards to volatility in the absence of verifiable gain. Bit of a chicken &amp; the egg problem here. I am very optimistic in regards to Bitcoins future but taking an objective stance on this problem at this stage in the game does not allow much optimism. 
In another 6 months you'll probably have a better argument to put forth once the space has evolved. Wouldn't you agree? Unless of course you could convince them to use Bitpay... Which costs virtually nothing anyway, perhaps make some inroads with the CEO? A rather competent fellow, perhaps he would be willing to tag alone with your meeting; sounds like it would be worth his time. 
@_date: 2013-12-15 17:45:49
The process that you're worried about is very simple really; I would advise you to try it out yourself and see how easy it is.
@_date: 2013-11-20 06:39:38
You do realize that people sold at the top right? And many of them no doubt bought back at the bottom. I sadly slept through the drop yesterday, the one night I forget to set my alarm... 
Alas, I have more than doubled my BTC holdings since I started back in April so yeah... Trading has worked pretty well for me and I have only been doing it for 8 months. 
@_date: 2013-12-02 13:28:52


This is false, whilst Bitcoins can be anonymous every single transactions is publicly available in the blockchain which goes all the way back to the inception of the blockchain; you can follow the trail of any Bitcoin that has ever existed. In this respect it is far less anonymous than fiat currencies which can be exchanged without any account whatsoever of the transaction. 


That is the assumption that everybody makes yet by every metric of measure the use of Bitcoin for legitimate purposes continues to grow as more and more merchants support its use. 
I personally do not mind spending my Bitcoins and I do it often, I can always replace that with fiat... The easier that it becomes to move fiat into BTC the less of an issue that this becomes. Moreover, spending a fraction of what I spent earlier to purchase Bitcoin puts a smile on my face, not entirely sure why. 


You mean inflate the monetary supply? I personally like owning something which cannot be debased. Since the removal of the gold standard the US dollar has lost its purchasing powers many times over. Current economic dogma stipulates that this is the answer to our economic problems yet despite massive injections of money into the economy the problems merely get worse.

I say this as somebody with quite a few Bitcoins; I do not mind spending them. 
Why? I can always move fiat into Bitcoin to replace what I spent. As fiat &lt;&gt; Bitcoin continues to develop and becomes easier to carry out without hassle this issue rapidly solves its self. 
I also get satisfaction from spending less than I would have otherwise from sitting in fiat. Moreover, I believe a lot of people have this mentality; otherwise the legitimate economy of Bitcoin wouldn't be continuing to grow at its current pace.

Just the other day I bought some t-shirts, a laser pointer (expensive one too) and donated money to a few charities. If I could use BTC to buy food, fuel &amp; pay rent I would because its easier and more convenient. The only problem is moving fiat into BTC.

Let me get this right, you know virtually nothing about Bitcoin but you come here with your assumptions which are not substantiated with anything but opinion and you expect people to take you seriously? 
I would bother counteracting your points if they were worthy of consideration but virtually the entirety of your argument has little basis in reality; the past 24 hours hundreds of millions of dollars worth of Bitcoin was bought and sold on exchanges all over the world. 
Please stop rolling your face on the keyboard.

Cannot? 
It could. Bitcoin has the potential to be everything that it claims; will it? Well, that is the question. Many are betting money that it can, many are devoting their lives to building the infrastructure and businesses upon this transformational technology. 
And yeah it could all goto shit. But that is blatantly obvious to anyone with half a brain so why on earth are you acting naive when you know better? You're not stupid, you can see the negative aspects clear as day. 
Anyway, yeah, there should be a disclaimer - but you don't have to be such a negative Nancy all about.

That is not where Bitcoin is headed at all. Venture capitalists &amp; startups are doing their utmost to create businesses which facilitate fiat &lt;&gt; Bitcoin for its ability to store and transmit wealth is unparalleled; international remittance is going to drive that. ATMs and businesses which operate exchanges &amp; fiat &lt;&gt; withdrawals/deposits is where everything is headed. 
With that comes regulation. Bitcoin is coming out of the closet in a big way, what you're proposing will make up a small part of it. Chances are that community will fragment away due to Bitcoin becoming more transparent and less anonymous.

Ignoring the above or heavy regulation from the states I think hitting 10,000,000,000 market capitalization at the very least is highly likely.

Satoshi himself said that the designation of BTC was arbitrary. Meaning all of the current numbers surrounding a BTC from the Satoshi to mBTC are simply 'made up.' They are real simply because of the initial designation of what the numerical value of a BTC is within the protocol. 
All I am suggesting is thus: 
Have a basket of currencies: CNY/USD/EUR - average it
That number essentially = 'xBTC' - the number of BTC that equals that value fluctuates. Merchants and people wishing to transact in BTC can use this number in everyday settings for it does not have volatility.
I don't even know if its a good idea, just thought I'd throw it into the discussion on interpreting arbitrary values.

Bitcoin is extremely controversial, polarizing and divisive; there is no way in hell that you'll be able to sell it so easily due to it being such a revolutionary idea which challenges the current paradigm. 
The best you can hope for is aiding and facilitating its utility whilst the more open-minded and intelligent folk actually take the time to understand the implications of the technology. 
It is going to take time, the dialogue is already changing and the longer Bitcoin is around and used the more positive people will view it and take the time to understand it.

You can indeed; wouldn't be a fair overview of Bitcoin without at least checking it out - just know that the illicit trade of Bitcoin is taking up less of a percentage of overall trade with every passing day.

I like how you failed to mention that you can send Bitcoins anywhere within the world virtually instantaneously and for extremely little cost; if you were able to cover that I would give your argument credence. 
But you didn't. Western Union takes %9 + in fees. Transfers over SWIFT take 3-5 days and you have to pay anywhere from $40-100. Bitcoin costs virtually nothing and confirms within half an hour. 
Bitcoin is vastly superior, it isn't even a debate. The only problem is that there isn't enough liquidity between fiat &lt;&gt; Bitcoin but that is exactly what tens of millions of dollars of venture capital money and numerous businesses around the globe are working on...

They have had far too many new customers as of late and are having trouble dealing with the amount of activity.

It is so extremely volatile though and it is hard to imagine how that will lessen with even more money injected into the economy; it is not hard to imagine a $1000 or $10,000 drop given Bitcoin starts to be used by even %3 of the worlds population or so. 
How can you use that to price everyday goods and services? I'm divided on whether or not Bitcoin will be used in that manner. Not to say that it will not to used, far from it but once the market capitalization increases substantially the volatility will mostly likely follow suit.

The central idea being that you give your voting power to somebody to represent your interests; these tokens can be given and taken away from individuals in real-time allowing accountability and a dynamic system of governance.

So we have a huge bloated system which is remarkably inefficient in comparison to Bitcoin which the majority of people do not like and its sole advantage is its ability to lend money? You realize that there is absolutely nothing stopping people from loaning Bitcoins to people at interest right? 
Obviously this is a purely theoretical debate at present for Bitcoin is a drop of water in the ocean; yet at a fundamental level Bitcoin is the far superior option to traditional banking institutions. That is why venture capitalists are pouring money into Bitcoin &amp; are very optimistic about its future. 2014 will be the defining year for Bitcoin I believe, if Buttercoins international remittance business goes into the real world and works things will start changing/growing rapidly. 
By the way, you never countered my points related to Western Union.

Your concerns are perfectly valid and understandable; bitcoin is inherently volatile at present for it is undergoing massive adoption and massive speculation. This however will begin to stabilize as time goes along. 
In regards to pricing in Bitcoin; I believe that in time most of this will simply be automated not requiring any calculations on the part of the customer &amp; merchant - a QR code or swipe of a card will take care of the numbers. 
Moreover, the interpretation of the value of a Bitcoin will change given the price continues to rise - prices will appear in mBTC or in Satoshis or another term which will be applied to Bitcoins. 


You should look at a graph of the real value of a U.S dollar since the removal of the gold standard... If you like your purchasing power constantly being eroded and destroyed sure, it is a good idea to move away from the gold standard; I personally think its terrible and is simply a further tax on the middle and lower classes and which destroys savings.

Bitcoin is scarce, people own it, the divisibility of it does not change the ownership - whether or not a Bitcoin is divisible is irrelevant because the percentage share of the total amount of Bitcoins is still shared amongst the same individuals and or groups.

You're absolutely right and I do not disagree with your logic. I shouldn't have solely typed out a singular paragraph being all hand-wavy; I assure you the rationale behind what I said is far more elaborate and detailed than what I posted but it was 5am and I was rather tired. 
The current value of Bitcoin is largely based on speculation at present without the amount of trade to justify its current market capitalization. That said, it is the promise of its utility as a global mechanism of storing and transferring wealth which I would argue gives it's current speculatory value. 
Given Bitcoins current trajectory and barring heavy handed US regulation I would argue it is the utility of Bitcoin that will give it value; namely due to it being scarce. Once you have thousands of ATMs, once you have instant fiat &lt;&gt; Bitcoin businesses and people are using that system to transfer and store wealth it will derive the majority of its worth from its utility as a mechanism of exchange; namely due to its use and trust that people place in that system, hence willingness to accept Bitcoin, that acceptance giving it worth which is derived from its utility. 
@_date: 2013-11-20 07:24:54
I do not disagree that many people lose out trading; the vast majority no doubt but there are competent individuals out there who profit off of trading in the long-run. 
If your argument held true wall street wouldn't even exist, an entire industry of very wealthy individuals exist whose sole job it is to buy and sell various financial assets; whether or not that is beneficial is another argument but the fact remains that many individuals sole job is to trade.

If your argument held weight companies like Western Union wouldn't exist, yet they do. Transferring wealth amongst an economic union or within a nation's borders is entirely different to transferring wealth globally, that requires large fees and takes time. 
Your counter argument is that thousands of international institutions with various competing goals &amp; aims are going to unite together to combat Bitcoin. Yet they won't do that until Bitcoin is actually a competitive force, which I would argue would be too late. 
At present banks are content with companies like Western Union for their market-share is minute comparatively &amp; making deals amongst thousands of entities is extremely hard to do.  
Moreover, Bitcoin is inherently better due to it being extremely efficient at being a global transaction network which spreads the cost amongst millions of users. Banks by comparison hire millions of people, buy servers, hire network admins, hire lawyers, et cetera et cetera... It is remarkably inefficient and only works due to there not having been a viable alternative.

It proves absolutely nothing at all, you're talking about specific banks moving money around their own networks &amp; with partnerships with other large banks. Problem is, this is within a specific geographical region and completely ignores the multitude of international banks all competing amongst one another. Furthermore, fees are what pays for the underlying operating costs of banks, without that you're looking at billions of dollars per year to operate. 


I never implied that, you're being quite unimaginative if you cannot envisage the ways loaning could manifest its self within a crypto-currency dominated society. Hint; it could look a lot like traditional forms of lending. 


You're completely ignoring the hidden costs; SWIFT does not operate independently but is apart of a much larger entity. Comparing the two is completely disingenuous. Bitcoin reduces the totality of traditional banking minus lending into software which can run on virtually any networked device; how you can believe that running such a system with millions of employees, millions of offices around the globe is more efficient or cheaper is absolutely beyond me. Feel free to explain how I am wrong here though please.

The biggest thing that people ignore when it comes to cryptocurrencies is that of infrastructure; alternative cryptocurrencies are largely useless due to not having exchanges, merchants, companies developing services, ATMs et cetera et cetera... 
At the end of the day, your lines of code are useless if there are no foundations. This is also why the whole argument of 'Bitcoin is bad because you can simply make another one' is a terrible line of reasoning.  
Without such basic fundamentals the alternative cryptocurrencies are virtually worthless with the exception of Litecoin (which its proponents argue shares a symbiotic relationship with BTC (not independent)) due to it being added to Mt.Gox (and hence Coinbase) and BTC-CHINA at somepoint in the distant future. Moreover, notice how none of the alternative coins are indepedent from BTC, as another user once said; 'when Bitcoin sneezes the alternative coins catch a cold.'

That makes absolutely no sense at all and I don't simply mean grammatically. Such a claim states that any deflationary currency will increase in value; essentially you're proposing money growing on trees simply due to the rules which govern a deflationary currency. Moreover, the monetary supply continues to increase, its merely the adoption which is driving the price up.


Pretty baseless statement there. Have you read the Wedbush report?  
There are numerous talented and wealthy individuals betting that Bitcoin is going to fulfill what it claims; the infrastructure to allow that to happen is developing at a rapid pace and real-world uses are beginning to emerge.

Andreas Antonopoulos is a very intelligent individual and gives a good overview of many aspects of Bitcoin &amp; Cryptocurrency.

Are you new around here? This is exactly the same story that has been repeating throughout Bitcoins life-cycle; the parallels to April are uncanny.

An article for whom?

I assure you the language on the sign is Chinese and not Thai. Also the sign next to it, the L, it stands for Litecoin ~

I think that you're missing the entire utility of Bitcoin; it is a global payment system with extremely minute transaction costs. That alone is its utility, that alone is why so many intelligent &amp; influential people sing its high praises. 
Your other points I do not disagree with, but my point is that those negative aspects pale in comparison to the aforementioned utility that Bitcoin provides. Moreover, the whole store of wealth aspect is very big and is why the Chinese love it so much. Yet the reason it has value is due to its utility; the ability to move wealth around the world at extremely little cost.  
Without that I wouldn't have any money invested into Bitcoin whatsoever, yet it truly is a transformational technology due to its intrinsic ability to move capital. Without addressing why this is irrelevant I cannot take your argument seriously.

Is this sarcasm?

LeScarecrow - I am sure that in your mind you're a lovely individual; sadly Bitstamp does not know that and they have to deal with laws &amp; regulations which stipulate that you need to abide by this. 
If you don't like it, nobody is forcing you to use their service - my recommendation would be to buy locally.

I have made good money out of crypto-currencies thus far; I however am under no illusions that I haven't been contributing to the economy/society. 
Hopefully people in my position choose to use that new found wealth to create; I certainly intend to and that is what I am now putting my mind too. I'm sure that I am not alone.

He took the bet? That is awesome. 
Will he definitely pay? Barring heavy handed US regulation and or a protocol failure I would say that money is yours.

The problem with dropping Bitcoin at such a point is that it would be so ingrained within the economy that simply switching to an alternative crypto-currency isn't that easy. 
One argument I always make against the claim that 'what is stopping other people from creating a different Bitcoin' is that of underlying infrastructure; yes you can have an alternative crypto-currency but without the exchanges, without businesses accepting it and without perceived legitimacy they are rather redundant and pointless. 
Assume Bitcoin takes off massively, people use the blockchain for asset registration, (cars, houses et cetera) millions of ATMs worldwide, most merchants accepting it... At that point simply dropping it isn't an option. 
But yeah, you could use an alternative crypto-currency, but chances are you'll be in the minority with much reduced real world usage.

I honestly think you could get $100/200 + 
Assuming it is as robust &amp; qualitative as it looks - people do not mind paying good money for quality given it has longevity. Go for the higher end market, there is most definitely money in this &amp; lots of people holding Bitcoin are rather wealthy. 
Also, anyone saying less than that obviously hasn't a clue as to the amount of effort that goes into the manufacture of such a thing. Anyway, such people wouldn't be your market.

There are numerous venture capital firms around the world right now working on this very problem; what most companies are working on is facilitating fiat &lt;&gt; Bitcoin - once this is fluid and easy to conduct remittance will come naturally. 
It is simply a question of infrastructure, once there are ATMs in many countries, once you can buy Bitcoin at the corner shop et cetera you will see it grow organically and naturally throughout the world facilitating money transfer across borders and oceans.

Don't feel bad about it, was a very nice chart to show to us all ~

I completely understand, you're a public figure and your work is very much tied up with this central question which you no doubt don't want to give away before it is released. 
Anyway, good luck &amp; I look forward to watching your documentary.

Any chance you could elaborate more on how BitPay works? I have only used Bitcoin to buy the humble bundle which took around half an hour. Apart from that I just use a few exchanges so am used to waiting awhile.
 And what are the rare cases of double-spend? How possible is that? 
@_date: 2013-12-15 18:03:34
If your persona and confidence is anywhere near the level of the presentation you posted you'll do very well I think. Do not act subservient; be calm &amp; collected and if they're interested in Bitcoin I am sure you'll be the first person that they will offer a job to ~

OP - some reading/watching for you from reputable sources. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 07:30:35
Thanks for taking the time to explain yourself and for what its worth I understand completely. That said I haven't the weight of experience watering down my expectations; although I am more than aware this could come crashing down at a moments notice by that same metric it may also take off quite literally. 
But you're right, far too many people around here believe the more optimistic perspective without even taking into account the fact that it could all crash &amp; burn.    
@_date: 2013-06-06 06:36:00
You're walking around yelling that the sky is falling with a bunch of presumptions and assumptions. It would probably have a tiny amount of credibility if far worse things had not transpired in the history of bitcoin... I don't know, like the fall from 266 to 50. 
If BTC recovered from that, I fail to see how a 35k BTC selloff is going to ruin the party.

It is without a doubt worth that much in time &amp; labor - every single piece is custom designed requiring CAD design &amp; manufacture which is then hand crafted afterwards to make it very pretty.
