The web application is fairly mobile optimized but could be a lot better. This is definitely in the development plan. Is there anything you are looking for in particular?
We've now been fully implemented within the tabtrader app, so you can generate an API key and start trading on the  Vaultoro order book using their mobile app.

There is no promise, it's a physical asset you own. If you put a couch into a storage facility then it's your couch held in a bailment contract. This is the same with gold.
ETF's are promises. We only deal in and out of allocated gold and bitcoin.
You have great points by the way :)  It's really important for the community to be as vigilant as possible.

No but if they take even 60 percent of unskilled labour then we already have to think of an entirely diferant approach to society. Not that I like centralised planning but Its important that we try diferant things out. One of the reasons I love blockchains, crypto and smart contracts is the ability to deploy and test economic and governance models without gulags, or violence in general. :)

I didn't meen to come off passive aggressive. If you secure your own bitcoin on a hardware wallet like trezor or ledger and only put money onto en exchange when you need some fiat then that is the best way to go.

The Vaulting facility where our clients gold is secured is the second largest in Europe. Humans have thousands of years experience in securing physical assets and only 20 years trying to secure digital assets. Even if someone managed to get in, the gold is so heavy that it's impossible to steal very much.
What I am saying is that people use Vaultoro.com to hold their value in a physical good that is near impossible to steal, is secured in their name, is audited by one of the largest auditing firms in the world and fully insured. They can then use the vaultoro marketplace to convert that gold to bitcoin and spend it in seconds.

We at vaultoro do proof of reserve that is Mom usable. I have been giving talks at bitcoin meetups and conferences for years asking bitcoiners to only ever use exchanges with a good transparency protocol in place. This is important as a community, not only to save people from ponzi scemes but also to make sure we as a community don't get smashed with over burdening regulations. The best thing we can do is self regulate and demand that bitcoin banks and exchanges have radical transparency. I mean the blockchain makes this really easy to do. Here is our implementation of radical transparency while keeping user data private. Https://audit.vaultoro.com

If what he is saying is valid then that's great and it can be looked at and tried to be fixed, if it's not valid then it's not valid and at least it was explored. Sadly Reddit reinforces confirmation bias because of the nature of people not wanting to hear another side of a story.

This is why what we are doing at Vaultoro.com is important. 
Gold is a good, not a currency and it is secured in the client's name as their legal property and is off our books. 
If something ever happened to Vaultoro, then liquidators could not touch our client's property because it has nothing to do with us. It's customers gold in the vault, not Vaultoro's.
Within seconds people can trade back to bitcoin and withdrawal.
To stop people holding too much bitcoin on the exchange, we have an instant order function. As soon as the network confirms bitcoin deposits, Vaultoro can place a buy order at the user set price.

Money laundering is a relatively minuscule problem in any healthy economy. Trying to tie KYC to the unit of exchange itself is disgusting and entirely evil. There are bad governments in this world, and people researching at MIT surely know this yeah?
Please use your mental capacity, resources and energy to help make bitcoin more anonymous not less. Help individuals who live in overpowering cultures, assist the millions of women who live under domination and not allowed to drive or have bank accounts by their religious husbands, help people that live in dictatorships or fascist regimes, help individuals that live in countries with crippling currency controls to exit peacefully using an open source protocol! Don't help the bullies, thugs and power freaks.
We have TOR because we can all agree that there are a lot of legitimate reasons to use it. If TOR were to be compromised, it would endanger the many people using it for good. We would not dream of putting KYC abilities baked into TOR because of a short-sighted need to help our "good" government. While MIT might consider their government to be good, fine, and in need of help raising money, your actions WILL kill people that live in countries that are politically sensitive or extremely religious. 
I know academics lean largely left to big government because they get funded by the state, but please use your academic power for good and not evil.
Work towards more anonymity not less. Governments just have to do better old school police work to catch bad guys, leave money, which has only recently been used as a tracking mechanism out of it.
At the end of the day, bad people will use a more fungible cryptocurrency if bitcoin is compromised.
Try visiting Venezuela, Zimbabwe, Angola, Iran, or even China, too see what their government would do with ultimate KYC control.

Hi, 
we at vaultoro (the bitcoin / physical gold marketplace) offer you 20% of any trading fees accumulated by your referrals and a second tier of 5% for anyone your referrals refer to Vaultoro.
You earn commission for two years in bitcoin and gold. 
To start you simply need to register at  
and follow the prompts.
We have beautiful statistics, graphs and statements so you can easily keep track of your earnings. We also have a bunch of banners easy to use embed codes ready to go.
 If you have any questions, feel free to ask.

Heheh, thanks man. Ok so this is what I meant. We are looking to insert every trade into the blockchain and then have a multisig hot wallet.  One of the keys is held by a bot that checks the blockchain to see that a user had the amount of funds that they are wanting to withdrawal before signing a withdrawal. 
This would mean that a hacker could hack only hack one members account but not everybody's.

Our clients use bitcoin and gold together. Gold is heavy and super hard to move but has held value for over 3000 years. Bitcoin I lite, nimble and borderless but is still very young. We are seeing some really interesting scenarios where gold is being used as the store of value and bitcoin to move that value globally. Diversification is key.

Thanks, Ok some fun facts,
* We were the first true marketplace, not a single counterparty, so a fair market price is always available.
* All gold is allocated in your name as your legal property, secured in a bailment contract
* Vaulting Facility is one of the largest bank-independent vaults in Europe (Pro Aurum Switzerland) Thier vaults security rating is higher than most banks, the only bank that has a vault at the same rating is the German central bank (Deutsche Bundesbank) 
* Vaultoro clients gold is audited by one of the largest auditing firms in the world BDO International.
* All gold is fully insured.
* The Pro Aurum vaulting facility is in a Swiss Duty-Free Zone so no taxes on the gold, keeping it extremely close to world spot price.
* Vaultoro is one of the most transparent exchanges in the industry with a unique transparency protocol using the blockchain and anonymous ID's to publish full proof of reserve.
* Gold is categorised as a "Good" and not a currency so you may purchase up to 5K USD per day without KYC docs, EU regulations asserts that people can buy 7500 Euros worth of goods per day without KYC, we have lowered it to 5K to be well within the law. This is important to help people in developing countries who do not have the paperwork to satisfy KYC from companies like bitpay. It enables these people to accept bitcoin payments and still hedge volatility risk without going back to fiat.
* You can trade down to 0.0002 BTC (around 9 cents)
* We launched in February 2015 and have traded more than 4.3 million euros worth of physical gold.
* We have been a Crypto / Gold only business since launch.
* Physical delivery is available.

Yes to start, you have to be a verified member because we need to know legally who we are paying. But that is a very smooth process, and all info is naturally fully encrypted.
Your referrals, however, do not need to verify them selves for you to earn from their trading fees. They can trade up to 5K work of bitcoin and gold per day without verification.

Everytime someone loses bitcoin the rest of the economy will slowly gain value. We can add more decimal places behind the zero. If you lose all 21 million then even if there is 1 coin, we have enough for the whole world as we would just add some more zeros after the decimal point. This is unlike fiat. In paper money, they just print more, devaluing the rest. In bitcoin you take a cake and instead of baking more cake you split the one cake into more and more pieces.

Such a positive article! Great to see that the CFTC has a good head on his shoulders.
In conclusion, I note that when the Internet developed in the mid-1990s, none of us could have imagined its capabilities that we take for granted today.
Fortunately, policymakers had the foresight to create a “do no harm” regulatory environment that served as a catalyst rather than a choke point for innovation. Thanks to their forethought and restraint, Internet-based applications have revolutionized nearly every aspect of human life, created millions of jobs and increased productivity and consumer choice.
Policymakers must show that same forethought and restraint now.
Today, I repeat my call for my agency, the CFTC, and other U.S. and overseas policymakers and regulatory counterparts to repeat that broad-minded approach.
I look forward to working with my fellow CFTC commissioners, U.S. lawmakers and other financial services regulators here and abroad to develop a “do no harm” framework from which to launch a new era of innovation in distributed ledger technology – for the good of our markets, the jobs they support and the people they serve.
Thank you for your time and attention.

Payment codes hide the amount being sent, further anonymising bitcoin not by mixing but by hiding the amounts. This is important for businesses that don't want their competitors knowing how much they spent on supplies or who their supplier is or how much they are paying their employees and so forth.

From Wikipedia :)
IPFS is a peer-to-peer distributed file system that seeks to connect all computing devices with the same system of files. In some ways, IPFS is similar to the World Wide Web, but IPFS could be seen as a single BitTorrent swarm, exchanging objects within one Git repository. In other words, IPFS provides a high-throughput, content-addressed block storage model, with content-addressed hyperlinks. This forms a generalized Merkle DAG. IPFS combines a distributed hash table, an incentivized block exchange, and a self-certifying namespace. IPFS has no single point of failure, and nodes do not need to trust each other.[3]
The filesystem can be accessed in a variety of ways, including via FUSE and over HTTP. A local file can be added to the IPFS filesystem, making it available to the world. Files are identified by their hashes, so it's caching-friendly. They are distributed using a BitTorrent-based protocol. Other users viewing the content aid in serving the content to others on the network. IPFS has a name service called IPNS, a global namespace based on PKI, serves to build trust chains, is compatible with other NSes and can map DNS, .onion, .bit, etc. to IPNS.[4]

We need an email address for &lt; 5K USD worth of bitcoin per day. 
Most people do verify themselves before that because the metal is secured in your name as your legal property. If you do not verify yourself, then the gold is secured in the name of your email address. This can be hard for the clients estate's management to prove belonged to them in case of the death (sorry heavy) that's why clients like to verify themselves for larger holdings.
We are fully banking independent, so different regulations apply.
We have a very good FAQ at

Hahaha we didn't see it that way. Well the great thing is that the gold is allocated gold so it's not on our books. Even if we go broke a liquidator can not touch our clients gold because their holdings have nothing to do with our books. Vaultoro clients gold is their property secured in their name. So no fragility :)

I don't agree, If you run a company with the best product in the world, you will not get anywhere if you don't put effort into marketing it. Sure if it's really good you can do less because it's viral but bitcoin is not a company so we need to as users go out and ask people to accept it. I always ask stores to accept it. Why because I legitimately want to buy the thing from thier store with bitcoin because it's awesome. 
I think I must have personally got hundreds of people interested in bitcoin. This spreads the network effect. I'm not saying shout about it and annoy people but we can't just sit back and say "oh bitcoin is so great it will sell itself." Keep calm and carry on telling people about bitcoin, putting stickers up around town, email signatures and the rest.

The only thing people think of when they hear banks are money launderers, ass wipes, users, fools, global financial crisis and bailouts. The most people I know find bitcoin to be one of the most interesting and liberating technologies of our time. When I tell them about the potential to minimise poverty by potentially banking 2.5 billion people, enabling them to sell on a global market place with no banking restrictions or barriers to entry they are super impressed. Most people hate banks. Go on ask some random people if they like banks? Most will say no.

Hi, Joshua Scigala CEO of  here, we enable you to buy and sell assigned gold vaulted in a professional top-tier Swiss vault instantly with bitcoin. 
We have created one of the most transparent exchanges in the industry by having an almost realtime public audit protocol to prove that we are always above 100% reserve both in gold and bitcoin. 
On top of that the vaults are also independently audited by one of the  largest auditing firms in the world (BDO international) 
All gold is 100% insured and you can get it delivered out to you if you want. 
Vaultoro is the only true market place for bitcoin and gold so we are closest to spot price as there are thousands of people around the world bidding and asking through an order book.
You can buy and sell a minimum of 4 cents worth of bitcoin and gold so anyone can use gold not only as a hedge to inflation but a hedge against the bitcoin volatility. 
We are currently working on a wallet that will enable you to receive bitcoin payments instantly convert it to gold and then when you want to spend it it sells the gold and sends the value out as bitcoin. Creating the perfect global money. 
I was recently interviewed on the bitcoin podcast. Check it out. 
If you have any questions please don't hesitate to ask. 
Kindest regards

The separation of money and state using a money protocol that is not controlled by a single party, kinda like how the email protocol is not controlled by a single party. The bitcoin money protocol enables anyone to download free software and send value that is spent into existence and not lent into existence like paper money. Bitcoin is a tech where you push money to an address so people can't steal your account like they can with credit cards where people pull money from. It is also the first digital asset that can't be copied that's why it's good for money.

Bitcoin allows us all to build the tools of true change, tools that will enable the spirit of entrepreneurship to enable people to pull themselves out of poverty by joining a global market place they where blocked from  participating in by the legacy banking system.

We are very confident that what we have developed will discover a double spend attempt before we confirm a transaction. If there is any doubt then the system will wait for 6 confirmations as normal.  Double spends are definitely a big concern for everyone but we feel that we have found the correct solution by utilising blockcypher's API and a few tricks of our own.  :)
@_date: 2015-06-30 00:21:50
Thats also what I came here to say. Don't wait till the banks go into full lock down. Buy bitcoin and gold now! 
@_date: 2015-12-05 14:00:36
This was a concern for me too, all cold wallets are multi sig so none of the staff or executive team can sweep. The Gold is secured as users legal property in their name. We do not have permission to withdrawal the gold.  A real-time encrypted backup of all holdings is given to a 3rd party law firm with the private key given to a 4rth party law firm. If the executive team were to die in a plane crash or disappear then the law firms have been instructed to come together and repatriate users with their holdings. 
I lost a lot of money in the MtGox collapse and we have worked extremely hard to try to think of as many problems as possible to find solutions to. 
There are some people who only use BTC/FIAT exchanges and that's fine, but I got into bitcoin to get away from fiat and that's why my passion is building the most transparent and speedy bitcoin / Gold exchange :)
@_date: 2015-12-26 09:19:19

@_date: 2015-06-29 11:50:49
 users not affected :) Because we now use blockcypher's API to enable 0 confirmation deposits. We enabled this after the first stress test which caused some of our users to take hours to get to 6 confirmations. 
I talked to Josh from Blockcypher about the last Stress test and he wrote this back...
Thankfully, our Confidence Factor was unaffected last time. Yes, confirmations definitely took a whole lot longer, but the likelihood of successful double-spends didn't materially change. Good question though, and while the stress test was, appropriately, a bit stressful, it was a nice, robust confirmation about the resilience of our infrastructure. :)

@_date: 2015-06-25 13:19:04
We have ways of catching double spends as soon as they are found, which is almost instantly. If there is any doubt about a tx then we will wait for 6 confirmations and doubt shows up as soon as a double spend attempt  is seen on the network.
@_date: 2015-06-30 08:48:52
I'm sorry you lost respect for our service. The Science behind our system is very well researched and safe, BlockCypher does an amazing job with transaction confidence. We have a heap of fail safes in place so that even if a double spend happens on our system we would see it very very quickly and the system automatically reacts. I would definitely not recommend just accepting 0 confirmations without a lot of systems in place that keep an eye on the transaction.
And it's not for every service but for Vaultoro it works and is quicker for the customer, you know what they say, time is money.
The good people at Shapeshift also use this to give 0 confirmations and eventually most people will. 
Enabling 0 confirmations enables us to develop our mobile bitcoin gold wallet which will accept bitcoin and instantly convert an amount or all of it to gold and then spend it again as bitcoin. There are many reasons for us rolling out our safe 0 confirmation solution.

Such a scam, this is the state just making a license out of something free people and free markets have created. The market is already creating answers to problems like Mtgox like massive transparency, multisig wallets and more. Adding violence through an un-elected self appointed 'expert' that demands a license is against everything that bitcoin stands for. We all knew these regulations where coming but I still think the guy is a joke and the worst is that the regulations aren't as bad as they where so now people say oh wow they are pretty good.

I'm long both bitcoin and gold at this stage but we are noticing that people are taking advantage of these low gold prices. People are trading in and out of bitcoin and gold on our orderbook so it's dificult to see a long term pattern or know why they hold bitcoin or gold. Some people have a hedge and store a bit in both assets. (you can see that on our Audit page  
We just passed 3 million USD worth of trading on Vaultoro.com so it's great to see people hedging the bitcoin volatility in another private asset and not in paper.

So do I, but it's a great option for people In developing world to accept bitcoin without to much KYC that they don't have the paper work to satisfy. Gold is a good and people can buy a certain amount of goods without KYC. This means people in developing world can use bitcoin, instantly convert it to secured gold stored as their legal property to protect from volatility and then spend that anywhere in the world bitcoin is accepted. All without a bank account. :) 
We also have the most transparent exchange in the industry by fully using the power of the blockchain to have prove of above 100% reserve. It's not for everyone but we work hard to make bitcoin useful for a massive population by combining the historical stability of gold with the speed and transparency of bitcoin.

There is no other way, apart from some catastrophic failure it can only grow. So many smart people around the word are building products or services on top of the bitcoin blockchain. There is no way that everyone around the world will stop building on it. It might slow down or speed up but all in all it will only grow.

Due to change confirmation times you would be better off using the sendmany function on a cron every 15 minutes. It's not instant but makes it easier to deal with and most people are willing to wait 15 minutes. 
You can spend unconfirmed transactions but it's not recommended because if someone changes the transaction ID of the first transaction then all others will fail creating a mess for you to figure out.

Yes, your public key is public that is the whole point of bitcoin. You can give people a code (public key) that they can only put money into. 
Your private key let's you send the coins that are in your public key address. That's why you never want to share your private key. 
It is called a 1 way function because the public key is derived from the private key but it is impossible to deribe the private key from the Public key. 
But yes you can splash around your public key like there is no tomorrow and no one can steal your coins... But never share your private key.

The git commit happened an hour before new years. So at 11pm new years eve 2011 some pissed out of his head magot injects this massive vonerablity into one of the most widely used security pipelines. 
This is why it is so important to read and understand open source software. It's not good enough just to say, "oh it's open source, someone else would have checked it" if you can code or even Hack code then you should try to read it to make sure it's cool. 
My main concern is bitcoin related software because bitcoin is so fluid and we have all seen to many thefts happen.

It sucks that ether raises 7000+ BTC for some smart contracts when there is already coloured coins, Mastercoins, and others. And then projects like this get little dribbles of BTC. Dark wallet is so important for bitcoin. Anonymous tx is super important for legitimate businesses too. I would not want my competitors to figure out what I'm earning, or who my supplier's are. 
Edit. 26000+   :O

Selling something you don't own is fraud unless you tell the buyer specifically that they are buying bitcoin that don't yet exist. It can also be used as a tool to fraudulently drive the price of a commodity or stock down by inserting liquidity into the maket that doesn't exist. So you artificially inflate the supply, there for driving the price down. This is the tool used by Jamie Diamond and JPMorgan to suppress the silver price.

I have studied Austria economics for while now. My point is that when people buy bitcoins they tend to buy them as an investment and tend not to spend them unless they really have to. If people earn them they tend to spend them a bit easyer. I have no data to back this up so it's pure speculation. But I feel feel that way personally when I earn btc

But the only thing that can fuck a asshole is a dick, with some balls. The problem with dicks is they fuck too much or fuck when it isn't appropriate. And it takes a pussy to show them that. But sometimes pussies can be so full of shit that they become assholes themselves. Because pussies are a inch and half away from assholes.

This is why stealth addresses are so important to become a standard asap. If it doesn't happen soon then the powers that be can simply say you are not aloud to use mixing services. Yes they could say that at any time but legit businesses have a real need for privacy so competition doesn't find out who suppliers are or how much employees are paid and so on. Once it is a standard it will be much harder to ban.

@_date: 2014-12-21 17:30:34
Dark coin just takes coin mixing wich is part of the bitcoin dark wallet and makes it part of the core wallet of darkcoin. So the actual coin is no different as far as I know. So if you use dark wallet with bitcoin it's effectively the same thing as using darkcoin. The only crap thing is with darkcoin you have to use the QT core client so you have to download the whole blockchain, at least the bitcoin dark wallet is a just a browser extension which checks the blockchain hosted on servers around the world. So that's better I think. Anyway my point is bitcoin has everything we need. Most alts are pump and dumps. I'm sure you can make a good win from one if your lucky enough to guess which one will be pumped but most people I know have lost. And people I know that have just purchased small amounts of bitcoin every week over the years no matter what price are sitting pretty. Granted this year has been a massive correction but I have been watching bitcoin for a long time and in my opinion this correction is also almost over.

Be careful if people now come out of the wood work saying it was them and could you please send them back.

The situation is being fixed by the free market, we do not need the violence of the state to put up barriers to entry in this space. The free market is solving the issues because consumers are demanding more transparency. I LOST ALOT in the gox debacle and I do not want the state involved. Already exchanges are getting 3rd party auditing and offering insurance. We don't need the Mafia pointing guns at people and calling it regulation. Come on America, you guys where the champions of free market now days your becoming control freaks through fear. Fear of nothing but hype.

@_date: 2014-10-19 10:18:00
Yeah we thought a lot about using a decentralised exchange protocol in the beginning but they are generally slow and not efficient enough at price discovery (yet) and the Gold vault operator has to be centralised anyway as well as properly audited. So since the Gold storage is centralised anyway we voted for a super fast fluid centralised exchange for easy of use, speed and to give the bitcoin gold pair it's own price discovery mechanism. The most important thing is proper auditing, both the public blockchain cold and proxy hot through a hashed merkle tree obfuscation method and for the Gold, a world renowned professional accounting and auditing firm who follow and perform ISA Standards in auditing to prove that our Vault is always above reserve.  We are going to great lengths to ensure that the Gold held in bailment by vaultoro is legally owned by the user's who can take physical delivery at any time.  All the Gold will be fully insured too. :) We are extremely excited!

Sorry answered to the wrong guys. 
There are plenty of answers that the free market will think up as is currently happening with bitcoin taking the need away for government to run the money supply. I have a heap of ways that I think courts, schools, prisons, justice could work without a state. It's just that if I knew all the answers then I would be endorsing dictatorship wich is even worse than democracy. But there are some awesome books where people have come up with alternative ways to deal with roads, schools, police, justice. 
It's a great thought excersise to go through some of these ideas. Think of it as a science fiction and just try to play with the idea. 
The book is called practical anarchy. 
It's free as ebook and audio book but Costs for a printed book.

Just use an android wallet and don't worry about coinbase or bitpay. It's not like all your customers are all of a sudden going to start paying in bitcoin. Just get paid in bitcoin for a few things here and there and keep it in bitcoin. Then spend those bitcoins as the gain in value.

It is important to have a fee because of a few reasons. 
A) I don't trust exchanges without a fee because I want them to be profitable so they can invest in security and stay incentivised to keep a tight ship. 
B) I feel fees lower volatility which is not so good for speculators but better for bitcoin as a whole.

I like apple because once upon a time they where the mall guy taking on the big IBM, they where the people inventing and forging innovation. but now they are the closed ecosystem nightmare that most people don't like. The fact of the matter is their pay solution is a hack to try to make the 1950s tech work online. It only works in the US, it only works on iPhone 6 and the  vast majority of the world are on dumb phones or android. So really bitcoin is the only future. and we will see that.

@_date: 2014-11-08 01:24:44
It just happens. I have been in bitcoin since the CPU days and what I can say is that after every boom there is a consolidation where week hands get tired and sell and everyone (traders) are scared of to many big moves.  Just like the changetip craze that has sprung up over 1 week, so the next rally will also just pop up out of nowhere. Everyone will just start to stack on. The next boom will fly past the old highs. 
But no one really knows the future. This is just the patterns I have seen through the last 4 expansions.

Now that's a true company using bitcoin! I'm getting a bit tired of seeing "company x has started accepting bitcoin!" when really they are just insta-selling creating downward pressure on the markets. Yes not all companies can pay their  suppliers, I fully understand this but it's fantastic to see companies trying! 
I hope that the insta-selling phase of bitcoin will soon start slowing down as more and more people accept BTC and will be able to save money by paying suppliers who also started accepting BTC.

When taking a little BTC from a cold storage paper wallet it would be great if mycilium wallet told the user what the change address will be. We all  know it will send it back to the paper wallet but I have heard from a few people that they always feel nervous because they don't see the change address before sending. It's more of a consumer requrst as it's obvious for bitcoin crew but some of the market research we are doing at vaultoro comes with feedback like that. :)

@_date: 2014-11-05 10:18:28
Because he can't. That's the whole point. Every hour the blockchain database of transactions has 6 locks on the blocks created (confirmations) . This would take longer than the universe has been around to crack if every computer on earth worked on the problem. Now Satoshis coins have hundreds of thousands of locks (network confirmations) on them. Once somthing is in the blockchain for an hour, it is secured. Even if the bitcoin code was to have a bug, the bug would be fixed and the database (the blockchain) would be plugged back into the software.

I'm sorry to hear about your fate.
Your best bet is to print a paper wallet.  then put that paper wallet into a zipped locked plastic sandwich bag and also put one of those moisture sucking bags you get in shoe boxes to make sure any moisture is sucked up by it and not the paper wallet. 
You could use a password protected private key so that if someone finds it they can't use it, but if you get killed or forget the password then there goes the wallet. 
If you are worried about ink fading then you could get the private key qr code etched onto a wooden or metal block. But then I would use a password protected private key because you don't want to give an unencrypted private key to the workman makeing the etching.

I think a min tip of a network fee of 100 bits would be good because I think the 1 satoshi spam will get on peoples nerves and we will see a huge backlash from the wider internet. 
Like you wouldn't tip a busker on the street 1 /100th of a cent and then throw it in the bushes for him to find and thats how I feel single satoshi tips are like because you cant even withdrawal them, and this could put of noobs off bitcoin. Something like a 150 bits min is still nice and micro and at least a noob can withdrawal it and get 1 cent after network fee :) 
@_date: 2014-12-20 21:36:52
Bitcoin is not like yahoo, it is like tcp-ip bitcoin was the original and 99 percent of the alts are just clones with a different name. If we want crypto to take off we need to focus on one blockchain. Money needs to be rare that's why 21 mill is important. If every alt becomes popular than people won't know what currency to use. A few is ok I think the market will choose 2 or 3 looks like litecoin and doge might be the other two. But if way more become popular then it will devalue the whole market just like the tulip craze.

Because businesses don't want their competitors knowing how much they pay for suppliers, who their suppliers are, how much employees are getting paid and so on. It doesn't take to many brain cells to figure this out. Anonymity is part of money. Money was never meant to be a tracking mechanism. It has only become that since the invention of the credit card in the 1950s.

Why does everyone just think think moon as soon as a big company accepts bitcoin. We need a way of earning bitcoin for it to be moon material not just spend it. It's great being able to sell your bitcoins for services, don't get me wrong, and get real value but they are most certainly instaconverting wich is putting selling preasure on the price. I love that dish accepts bitcoin and it's a big part in the success of the currency but we really do need easyer ways to earn bitcoin or buy them. We need ways for people to easily add it to thier shopping cart software. We need to easily be able to pay employees with it. And so on and so fourth. But every step counts for sure.

@_date: 2014-03-30 10:00:08
That fiat currency is lent into existence, so if you have 10 dollars in your pocket, someone owes 10 dollars with interest to a bank somewhere. This creates a permanent cycle of debt slavery. That bitcoin is instead spent into existence not lent into existence.

I think OP means the unbanked Africans now have potencial access to a global market. Bitcoin is still a little complex and hoop jumpy for main stream unbanked but that will get easyer exponentially. Especially as smart phones start overtaking 2nd gen cell phones. We at vaultoro are working to let them hedge some of the volatility in gold as well. It's all these types of innovations that will bring the world closer to free (as in freedom) money and markets.

Imagine if there where thousands of alternatives to the TCPIP protocol. It would be shitty because no one else would know on what to build. Anyway even if side chains come out it would not kill alts because people love the bet of a pump and dump. But you are correct, there are some great developments in some alts but sadly they will have a hard time seing mass adoption because of the network effect. If you people want them to see the light of day then alt dev's will want to work thier ideas into a side chain. But then again can they make great money with a premine on side chain? The incentives change. Not sure, but interesting.

This is why this needs to be standardised soon because if only 10% of people use coinshuffle or mixers then the 50/50% starts looking very diferant. And that will let competition and /or BB no more.  As well as regulations swooping country by country declaring shuffling of any kind illegal. Rendering the bitcoin not as fungible. But once it's standardised and people are using it day to day it then becomes alot harder to implement regulations which stifle the bitcoins fungibility.

For sure, the power of multi sig wallets and technologies that give rise to safety is only still very young. Some hardcore people understand it but it will only be mass adopted once it becomes super simple. Saying that I think the maturity and EAS of use of bitcoin and blockchain technology is happening much faster than the internet I would say something like 3 years to every 1 year or more. So bitcoin will mature extremely fast indeed.

Naked short selling is the method that government's, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan use to keep their short positions in gold and silver profitable. It really is a corrupt scam and I hope bitcoin and it's community never tolllerate it.

This is why I recommend stores not to insta-liquidate to fiat if they can afford not to. Because it's only 12 percent of your sales and so try to hold the bitcoin and spend them as bitcoin with other stores.

Hi guys! Well done on a great product. 
2 questions. 
1. Is there a way to create hash from hardware configuration? 
So that people could run a program on Trezor that would basically figure out a hash according to the hardware that exists in the device so that people can check it against what you have on your website and be sure there was no man in the middle attack from the factory to consumer. It wouldn't be a problem yet but when bitcoin becomes super main stream something like this would help a lot.

I would like to see the transactions where 650,000 BTC got stolen, to my knowledge no one has found these transactions on the blockchain and so my feeling is that Gox is spinning bull dust. Until we see these transactions my feeling is that the MtGox management are trying to pull a fast one, and these 200K btc are just a way to appease the masses and they sneak out the back door with 650K BTC

Well diners club was first but was not like a credit card we know today. In 1959, American Express introduced the first card made of plastic. About 1 million cards were being used at about 85,000 establishements within the first five years, both in and out of the U.S. So that's less than bitcoin. credit cards had an unlikely push though, when the colour TV started to arrive in the stores. Everyone wanted one and these new credit card thing could pre approve you for money that you still didn't have and people went nuts using them to keep up with the Joneses by buying a colour TV on credit. 
Bitcoin has its killer app with bitcoin tipping, remittances, non reversibility, anonymity if needed, gambling, black and grey markets, global trade and contracts. 
The only thing still missing for bitcoin is easy on ramps which America has and to a certain extent Europe, but they will become world wide fairly fast. 
And ease of use / ease of security is what's needed. 
PayPal also needed 10 years to become mainstream.

There are plenty of answers that the free market will think up as is currently happening with bitcoin taking the need away for government to run the money supply. I have a heap of ways that I think courts, schools, prisons, justice could work without a state. It's just that if I knew all the answers then I would be endorsing dictatorship wich is even worse than democracy. But there are some awesome books where people have come up with alternative ways to deal with roads, schools, police, justice. 
It's a great thought excersise to go through some of these ideas. Think of it as a science fiction and just try to play with the idea. 
The book is called practical anarchy. 
It's free as ebook and audio book but Costs for a printed book.

Sorry, I was talking about big bank fails. 
I don't thing 250 bitcoins isn't small change to a small startup. I think the equivalent to a major bank would be a nice chunk.
The good thing about BCI is that an attacker has to hack individuals instead of 1 honey pot. Exchanges can't do this because for the sake of speed and price discovery but online wallets can.
@_date: 2014-12-10 00:19:23
yeah your right it's definitely not perfect, saying that, they are trying and have been in the game for a very long time. I think projects like copay.io are so important for the echo system. blockchain.info would do well to create true multi sig wallets.

Yeah, it's crap that as a freelancer there is no service where I can send an invoice with a bank number and as soon as the employer pays into it, it converts to BTC and sends them to me. Like a reverse bitpay/coinbase. It's all these know your customer regulations stopping this kind of service wich needs to happen to stop the downward pressure. 
This kind of service would also be great for me as an European doing some freelance for an American firm because the American firm would get a local bank account to pay into (sidestepping the huge fees) and I would receive the BTC wich I can spend over here as bitcoin or convert if needed.

This is a common mistake. There is a difference in deflating and inflating. Look at it like this, if you take 1 cake and start cutting it into smaller and smaller parts let's say 21 pieces then there is still the same amount of cake as a whole (that's deflation) . But If you bake 21 more cakes then there is 21 times the cake (that's inflation)

Regulations only crush and stop  innovation. We are building an exchange at the moment but are working on both technical and maket  based solutions to proof of solvency. These will not only be good these will be far better than corrupt regulators. Also regulations are usually set up by the big established players in any industry to lock out new players by making it far to expensive to compete. This is why there has been no innovation in the financial technology sector in more than 50 years. Ps, I lost a lot on gox

I worked at a major television station for 12 years. I can tell you that it's half true. The news is very very controlled. Most of the time it's FUD because they want sensationalist headlines. But sometimes they won't touch a story because it could effect a major partner. 
Most news has also stopped investigative journalism because it's way more expensive than just sending a few journalists to parliament house and having them "report" repeat what the politicians are on about. I had personal experience with a journo telling me they would be told to cover certain stories for favourable access to important politicians. 
Anyway it's not all that conspiratorial. 
@_date: 2014-12-13 09:57:59

The fundamentals that you have to know is that it's not a program that can be hacked. It's a protocol. It's the first decentralised unalterable database (after 20 to 30 minutes) and it's the first money that has no authority deciding how much will be printed today. It is also spent into existence not lent into existence like USD or EUR. The debt based system means there are always people forced to be in debt and forced to borrow more to pay the interest. That means if you have 50 bucks in your pocket, someone somewhere owes 50 bucks to a bank. (if the doesn't make sense then see a documentary called the money masters. There is also a great shot video by Mike Maloney) no one needs permission to open an account or work on the protocol or projects on top of bitcoin. It's almost free to send any amount globally and it's instant. 
@_date: 2014-09-28 11:44:45

Finally someone that understands. The thing is that more people need to earn bitcoins. Because when you buy them you tend to save them and not spend them. When you earn them you tend to spend them.

There is a massive diferances between price and value. While price has tanked the value has sky rocketed in the last year, due to huge amount of dev work working on projects based on the blockchain. That's why bitcoin is really cheap at the moment. IMO People that buy bellow 1000 are going to be considered early adopters.

Shorting is not bad or good. It's a normal and important market function. What's bad is naked short selling, which big institutions do to crush whoever they want. The naked means they don't even borrow the stock or commodity they are Shorting, they just say they have them and put way more supply in a market than exists. Luckily this does not happen in any bitcoin markets yet.

They where great days. We at vaultoro have now taken gold trading to the next level with real time in and out letting us all hedge the bitcoin volatility without going back to fiat, which most of us want to leave behind. :) In one way I miss the excitement of the old days where everything was so new, where finally we had a technology that could dethrone the global banking cartels and  make it obsolete but what I love is that even after 5 years of blockchain obsession  I still wake up and see new exciting developments. Everyday there is another bit of infrastructure that gets added to the bitcoin ecosystem.

I have been in bitcoin since $1, this downtrend historically happens before a massive rally. It over sells and then the market turns and it gets over bought and you get these uptrend bubbles. I am buying on this little downtrend.

No, they are just good at marketing and litecoin was the second alt coin so it has network effect. It has little differences like faster confirmation times but they take twice as long to be the same security as bitcoin so it equals out.

I don't meen to be rude and appreciate your opinion.
 I have also been in software dev for a long time and the way I see it is that the incentives as well as the code stop it from being vulnerable. First if an attacker somehow finds a vulnerability, by using it it would cause the bounty of his work to go to 0 so he would just have to do it for LOLz. But every block is hashed with the last one. The only thing that might be able to unhash is a theoretical quantum computer. So the database is safe especially after the 6th block, so the last hour of transactions might be attacked. The protocol is short and sweet in code and even if a bug was found, the incentives are in place for all miners to work as fast as possible to patch the bug. 
Yes you are correct there might be somthing that could be attacked but it is about as unlikely as the email protocol being attacked and all emails on earth disappearing.

This is what we have been working on since Feb. Building a company with glass books, audited both publicly via the blockchain and with BDO, one of the world's biggest auditing firms. Our trading engine is really fast, we are very proud of what we are building. We can finally truly get out of fiat because now people can lock in value as private physical gold held is professional Swiss vaults, held in your name, instantly spendable as bitcoin, transparent and private. If all goes well we will be launching before the end of the year. Stay tuned. :)

I was an early adopter and got stung by gox. I know, I should have know better. Anyway this is why we are building vaultoro. That everything can and will be auditable and in hard assets. As terrible as gox was for you, me and thousands of others, the good thing is that it has educated the market into expecting way more from exchanges, this is real market regulations because if companies don't comply with the rules the market expects then they go out of business. But I'm still hopeing we might see some of our money back.

Totally! 
A ponzy scheme needs new people to pay the interest that the older investors expect. Bitcoin as currency does not need to pay any one more that they put in and still works as money if it goes down in value. 
The notion that there is not enough supply is also idiotic (coming from a so called expert economist non the less) I mean if all bitcoin where lost and only 1 remained. It would be enough to supply the whole world with currency because it is infinately divisible.
(yes only 8 decimal points at the mo, but it could be thousands if needed)

It's almost impossible to have an "attack vector in the source code" of bitcoin. Even if there was the database (blockchain) is impossible to destroy past maybe 5 or 6 confirmations. All that would happen is the bug in the code would be fixed and the blocks would keep on building. 


Yes and no. The whole world can potentially work on is because it's open source. And thier are quality checks because every new business that builds somthing cool for bitcoin has internal quality checks and software teams. 


It's not poker, by putting money into bitcoin you are kind of buying stocks in every company that builds on top of this great protocol. I don't see it as risky at all in the long term.

Think of each block like a plane, it is full of people that want to fly to Europe. The problem is that all the passengers have a heap of carry on. So much so that not only are all the over heads full, but 40% of the seats on the plane are taken up with baggage (witness data) . This means a heap of people can't get on the pane.
Segwit is taking all that baggage and putting it into the holding Bay. Now way more seats are available. 
But it's not only a way of making more place for passengers. It's also fixing somthing called transaction malleability which Mtgox blamed for the hack. Although if that was the issue then Mark was still extremely negligent because it's been a known bug for many years. 
This bug means that a passenger could get on the plane but then change their name in mid air. When they arrive they never officially arrived and the system doesn't know where they are. 
Ok enough with the plane analogy lol

They are two very diferant systems. Fiat currency is lent into existence, bitcoin (like gold) is spent into existence. This changes the dynamic of a currency far more than just one being able to be printed out of thin air. The other issue one must think about is, is it moral to print more money when ever 1 small group want to? Knowing that it is taxing savings.

We have a lot of miners mining to gold on vaultoro so our wallets are full of small transactions and sometimes payouts take a while. Viabtc has a thing on their website called transaction accelerator 
Basically if you submit a transaction there, they will include it into the next block they mine. 
We are working on a better fee structure but our clients get pissed when we charge to much and get pissed off when tx takes too long. 
I don't like paying too much of a fee because it incentivises miners to continue blocking scaling solutions like segwit because they will loose the high fees. 
Anyway Rock and hard place situation.

@_date: 2016-01-27 09:22:41
Thanks for your feedback. It's always great to hear concerns people have and what we can do to alleviate them.
Our whole platform is based on the fact that you do not need to trust us because of our public audit using the blockchain and anonymous iDs (The Vaultoro glass books protocol).
Everyone can verify their own holdings and that we are above 100% reserve. If Mtgox had what we had in place then massive red flags would have popped up all over the internet because people would have seen that they were running a fractional reserve. 
We have been leaders in the radical transparency movement since we launched and I give talks at bitcoin conferences all over the world on different auditing processes.
You can listen to the interview I had with Stephany Murphy from let's talk bitcoin and I also have many other interviews online talking about what we stand for and what our goals are. 
This is from our support articles and talks more about our transparency protocols. 
**The public audit:**
Every user is given an anonymous ID that only they know.
You can then go to the audit page (logged in or logged out so we don't know) and search for your code. 
You can see that your holdings are correctly represented and can safely assume that everyone else's is also because we can't tell when people are checking it so it would be far too risky for us to fiddle the numbers.
You can then scroll down and see the sum of all our users bitcoin holdings and gold holdings.
You can then compare the bitcoin holdings to the holdings in our cold wallets and warm wallets to make sure we are fully above reserve.
**Private Audit**
You can compare the total gold holdings to the weekly Vault Operator Statement from Pro Aurum (Pro Aurum is one of Europe's largest top-tier investment grade gold vaulting companies who have vaults in Zurich, Munich, and Hong Kong).
You can then read the BDO international auditing certificate (currently only in German sorry). (by the way, BDO international is one of the largest auditing firms in the world.)
You can also see the Insurance certificate who also have an independent auditor and they insure 100% of the gold.
**I see my account and it’s correct, (but that’s like logging to Bank of America and seeing your account balance - Is it true?)**
Not exactly, the point is that you can do it without being logged in. That means you can check it without us knowing that you’re looking. 
Banks know when you’re looking at your account so they can show you the correct numbers and banks do not show you everybody else's holdings.  This is called proof of liability.
A real bank would never show in real-time what liabilities it has in full. Vaultoro shows this and then proves through the BDO audit certificates, Vault Operator statements and insurance papers as well as the bitcoin cold wallet and warm wallet addresses. **This is called the proof of reserves.**
Also, wish to see is that this audit firm publishes the list and not from Vaultoro.
The Auditor audits Pro Aurum. Vaultoro is the trading engine and settlement record keeper. ProAurum has a contract with 1 client, which is Vaultoro. By pooling all the clients in we supply the market with as close to spot price as possible. Then the users trade that between each other. All settlement of Vaultoro users gold ownership happens by us, We then anonymise and publish that audit of ownership live so everyone can check and so you don't need a private audit because the public one is better. 
The BDO audits Pro Aurum and proves that all the gold that belongs to Pro Aurum clients is there. The BDO checks that all our clients’ gold is there as a whole and not on the macro, we publicly show that part. 
The terms of use goes through everything in detail. :)
This is the BDO international audit certificate. A full ISA standard auditing procedure is very comprehensive and expensive so they happen two times a year to keep the costs down for clients, otherwise, fees would go through the roof. 
In the very unlikely event that something happens to Vautloro.
The independent Law firm  get access to a real-time encrypted copy of everybody’s accounts.
A fourth party law firm has the private key to this file and both firms have been instructed to come together in the unlikely case of our demise.
Remember that we do not own the gold, the Vaultoro members own the gold in full, and Vaultoro is just the trading, settlement and account keeper. 
The claims process would give people the option of receiving physical delivery of their gold or liquidating it for bitcoin and receiving the bitcoin.

the "Bitcoin unlimited" solution of letting miners choose their limit was our preference here at Vaultoro but now bitcoin classic is also looking good. We are ok with bitcoin core too but want to see block sizes raise. I also feel that raising block size will decentralise mining out of china a bit.

Great article! Thanks for taking the time to rebut such tripe. As far as I'm aware of you can't ban people from mining and saying that makes it sound centralised to newbies. I'm not a miner but as far as I know not all miners in Chinese mining pools are in China, they join the pool because they pay out more regularly as they are bigger. If there was something nefarious going on people would point their miners at other pools very quickly, it's happened a few times before. Also I think mining will decentralise again soon with bigger blocks, as countries with better bandwidth can compete with China's cheep power. But anyway there is nothing wrong with Chinese miners, they work hard. Also as ASICs become commoditized  they will become so cheap as to be everywhere and easy plug and play. This centralised phase in bitcoin mining is finishing soon. Imagine a lottery ticked that solo mines, cost you 5 bucks to buy and 10 bucks electricity every week but you have a chance to win 25 btc every 10 minutes. Imagine heaters built out of ASICs. Anyway its all not a problem. It's coming. Commoditization is coming.

Especially in Europe, people are not trusting banks. This is why a lot of our members use us.  [Vaultoro]( is a trading platform between bitcoin and allocated gold. The exchange sits on top of one of the largest private vaulting facilities in the world (Pro Aurum group). Anyway private vaulting facilities are the way to go for large savings moving forward not banks. We are now in negative interest rate territory and it's only going to get worse. The banking system is systemically wrong.

Well said. When I first put the Vaultoro team together I wanted total transparency in the exchange and developed a really easy to confirm proof of reserve protocol called the glass books protocol.
Every user gets an anonymous ID that only they know. We (vaultoro.com ) then publish a list of all anon id's with their bitcoin and gold holdings, updated it every 10 minutes for user privacy. All users can check their balance without being logged in so we can never fiddle with the balance because people could be checking. We then publish all multisig cold and warm wallets and pro Aurum vaulting facility statements, BDO international audit certificate as well as the insurance certificate. So people can check the sum of all user holdings against the blockchain and the audit paperwork. There is nothing more transparent that both private and public audit. Transparency is what bitcoin is great for,  and we still keep users private. :) 
I go around to bitcoin meetups and conferences giving talks about transparency because it's such an important topic. Bitcoin users must choose to only do business with transparent exchanges because otherwise another goxing will happen and the hammer of government regulation will come down to "protect people" and then startups will be stifled by costly bullshit regulations that only protect the incumbent legacy banking complex. 
Please folks, only use transparent exchanges.  You can check out our transparency protocol called the glass books protocol. Https://audit.vaultoro.com 
I was honoured to talked about transparency today before Andreas M Antonopoulos at the Berlin meetup. :) there should be a video soon.

I don't think it would happen anyway. The free market would insure that all isps would give the same access to all. I know if my ISP started throttling certain sites I would definately not stick around. I would simply change providers. This competition creates an even playing field as another ISP would see that there is demand for an even playing field and would offer it. 
We do not need to beg governments to aim guns at people and businesses to follow rules like this that most people want, and if most people don't want it then it's undemocratic to point guns at people for somthing a minority want. If the majority of consumers want a certain thing then smart entrepreneurs will offer that thing. The market if left free will ensure a level playing field.

We launched a few days before bitgold and you can't get bitcoins back for your gold on their platform. I really like Bitgold they are a great company but with Vaultoro you jump in and out of assigned gold and bitcoin. Trade back to bitcoin whenever you want and we are a full exchange so if we as market maker make our buy back price really bad then others will jump in front of us in the orderbook to get closer to spot price. Other services are just brokers and if they offer bitcoin back you are forced to pay their price.

no, but we looked at Colu when we were looking at tokenizing the users gold. For legal reasons, we decided not to tokenize but to leave the currency side of it to bitcoin. We would have opened ourselves up as being a currency issuer wich is illegal in a lot of countries (think e-gold). I think Colu would be awesome for smart locks or loyalty programs and many other cool ideas but backing a token with gold opens up a legal can of worms that we want to keep closed for now.

This is because people are building apps using our API and want to earn money from people using their trading apps. You can check out our API here. 
 
In terms of trading features, we are working on extending those too.
Currently, we are working on an instant trade feature and also a translation engine for other languages. Like I said above, we are also working on opening contracts with more vaults around the world and include Silver trading.

Thanks for your kind words, we are glad you like our service. We just got some funding from Techstars and going to be going to more conferences, so need to get bitcoin / gold are friends Tshirts made up . I'll let our users know when the design is ready :) 
Thinking somthing like this on the back.
Gold = Rare metals, found &amp; spent into existence without interest
Bitcoin = Rare numbers, found &amp; spent into existence without interest
Fiat = abundant paper, printed into existence as debt, with interest

If you are doing it to help the network then I don't think you can be scammed. If you are doing it to make a heap of money you prob will be scammed. It seams that you are doing it to help the network and so that's great.

Bitcoin is super volatile but really liquid and easy to move around, gold is historically Stable but hard to move around and not very easily divisible. This is one of the reasons vaultoro is becoming so popular, we mix both so people can use bitcoin and save in assigned gold.

Users can instantly convert bitcoin to allocated gold provable reserves on the BC and instantly spendable at any bitcoin address. :) man finance is changing so fast. True money is here. Bitcoin makes personal asset based digital currencies a reality.

Its value is not high or low it's value is what the market sets. It holds value because like bitcoins obituary of 8 years, gold has an obituary of 3000+ years. If fiat fails btc would be priced in gold.

The protocol regulates the base math, it does not stop one party from holding a large portion and nor should it. 
@_date: 2017-03-18 12:48:17
Yeah, this is definately interesting. 
We would have to look at what fees miners would eventually get. 
So Max tx per minute * price per tx should equal about the current block reward, so miners stick around. 
@_date: 2016-01-18 08:40:20
I (josh) used them 2 years ago to buy a HTC1, the transaction was perfect here in Europe. I also know the guys personally and they are very long standing citizens of the bitcoin community here in Berlin. 
@_date: 2017-03-25 01:17:05
You give me hope. But for me it's not the fighting, it's the game theoretical grid lock that gives me the shits. Saying that, I am seing a fire under Dev's passion being ignited to find other solutions to scaling. Schnorr sigs etc
I don't like the solution I'm about to say but it's a stop gap, a bridge to get us over this hump. 
 
We as exchanges do plenty of off chain transactions. This takes pressure off the blockchain. To deal with fee preasure we have to batch payments together and settle every x hours (broadcast a send many tx). A send many tx is cheaper per output than sending individual payments. We then build a stupid network of trusted institutions and settle more off chain but instant for the customer. 
I don't like this because it creates institutions that control private keys and centrally controls large pools of coins/keys. Basically the crap the global financial system is now. 
I would like miners to know that the  lightning network would remove the need for exchanges like us to hold private keys. You could simply open a channel and all the transaction would settle onto the main chain eventually. Miners would gain more volume as they get a cut of the fees collected from off chain TX's as well.
The Bonus for us is that we as an exchange would not need to hold private keys, which is great!
Activate segwit and profit both from an expanding decentralised network that has usefull utility causing it to go up in value and a cut of transactions that you did not have access to before.

@_date: 2016-01-06 15:06:00
We at  use 0-conf so people can instantly hedge into gold. 0-conf transactions are really important and must be cherished and strengthened. Yes it's not totally secure for 10 mins but we do many things in the background (including blockcypher) to counteract any double spends. 
@_date: 2017-03-14 07:08:42
Yes but bitpay hasn't sold to exchanges for years. They sell the bitcoin OTC to large holders. 
@_date: 2017-03-17 21:05:49
With decentralised storage solutions I don't think blocksize archives matter much. What matters is the propagation of solved blocks. Because the longer it takes to propagate a solved block, the longer the winner of the last block has as a head start on the next. This gives large pools advantages. But I think thier should be solutions to that too. 
@_date: 2017-03-08 23:03:47

@_date: 2017-03-17 21:13:13
Yes, good, but the point when I asked for this is more political, the point was that we find a compromise on both sides and stop the infighting to move onward. 
@_date: 2016-01-27 07:45:52
We have been around for over a year. And I have been in the bitcoin space for almost 6 years. The gold is not virtual, it is physical gold secured in your name as your legal property in one of the largest gold vaults in Europe (pro aurum) we are one of the most transparent exchanges in the industry with a full public audit using the blockchain and a private audit of users gold using the second largest auditing firm in the world BDO international. 
Proof of above 100% reserve has always been our goal and the blockchain does this. 
I'm not sure why you get a bad feeling from us but.  Being able to instantly trade in and out of a physically assigned asset and bitcoin solves a lot of problems. We are seeing a lot of people that do not have the paperwork to satisfy KYC / AML for fiat exchanges (because they are unbanked or living in a developing country) can now use bitcoin and hedge the volatility in a true asset. 
Gold is categorised as a good in the EU and the EU regulations state that a person can buy up to 7500 euros worth of a good with out all the paperwork. 
I (Joshua Scigala CEO) lost a lot of money in Mtgox so I totally agree that people should be careful with companies they choose to secure their wealth in. 
If you would like any more information please don't hesitate to ask. 
@_date: 2017-03-26 09:57:35
Yeah! I member 
@_date: 2017-03-07 23:46:13
Thats why we built vaultoro so people could stay in private money like gold  and jump to the right chain when needed.

You should add media to the list bitcoin talk forums, /r/ BTC, coimdesk, cointelegraph.com, bitcoin.org, bitcoin.com 
These are also important as bitcoin is also controlled by the user's and so the media forms their decisions on direction.

The original proposals where all hub and spoke but that's not the case anymore. We can have a channel between us two and whoever else you are connected to will automatically route through, I I need to pay them. It becomes a payment mesh network. And this network is not controlled by any one party. The only problem I have is the cost of funding a channel.

Many people use us  to instantly trade into allocated physical gold and then spend that gold as bitcoin again when they need to. That way their is no need to jump back into fiat. Gold is a good and EU laws for goods purchased are pretty lite.

Sadly not at all. If you go to their help centre and nothing shows up when searching for "audit" or "transparency" then I stay cautious. 
They have no proof of reserve at all. For a bitcoin company with the tools and resources, they have not to be transparent is extremely poor in this post MtGox and 2008 GFC world. They are a good place to buy but not a good place to secure your coins until they offer a provable public audit system.
@_date: 2017-03-07 23:30:03

I would like to see 2 mb to give runway for SW and LN. 
Best argument against this is that a miner could mine a full 2 mg block then have a head start on mining the next block leading to centralisation as one pool starts to win everytime due to the head start.

We at Vaultoro are all gold bugs and most diversify and use our platform  to buy allocated gold close to world spot and instantly sell it for bitcoin when they want to spend it. We now have thousands of members all around the world trading with each other in a globally recognised, fully legally owned, private asset that banks can not gamble with. Amazing time to be alive to watch the transition to full reserve banking provable on the blockchain.
The use cases we are seeing is that people love to receive bitcoin but are scared of the extreme volatility so they jump into allocated gold and then back to bitcoin when they need to spend.
A lot of our clients live in developing countries with high inflation so they use gold as an offshore asset and use bitcoin to move that value without friction or too much overhead.
Bitcoin is making gold relevant again as a currency. 
I recently gave an interview about this here.

This is what thousands of people use vaultoro for. They hold gold and spend it through bitcoin. Gold has 3000+ years of holding value but is hard to verify, hard to move while bitcoin is very young but is easy to verify and move around. By combining the two and adding a full proof of reserve we are managing to enable unbanked to accept bitcoin and instantly hedge the volatility in allocated gold and then spend that gold as bitcoin when they need to. Never having to touch the legacy banking system and being globally networked. Bitcoin is simply beautiful.

So I have put the free Ross BTC address through this taint analysis tool and there is no sign of going anywhere near a mixer. 
I think it's great that people are looking out for others in this community as there are plenty of scams but at the same time we must be careful in throwing the word scam around when people are genuinely working hard on a business or in this case trying to save their loved ones from spending the rest of their lives behind bars for creating a website.
OK, I just heard back from Lyn RE the 24.7 BTC.
The 24.7 BTC sent on the 30th was removed from our Blockchain wallet in response to an attempt by the hackers to access that wallet.  The 24.7 BTC were moved in a single transaction to the Ross Ulbricht Legal Defense Fund llc Coinbase account.  There were no other BTC transactions initiated by us on that day.  Those BTC are still in the Coinbase account.  We asked Coinbase to freeze the entire account on that same day, since the hackers were attempting to access it also. It remains frozen at the time of this writing.    Since the 30th there have been many donations sent to the 1Ross account on the blockchain, including a one BTC donation.  We are extremely grateful for the continued support of the community.

It doesn't matter what regulators do. Traders that want 100x leverage will go to an off shore exchange that offers is and has Chinese translation.

Joshua from  here. One of the reasons we opened the first true orderbook marketplace for allocated gold and bitcoin was that gold is a good, and In the EU you do not need KYC for the sales of goods until it goes over 7500 per day. 
We lowered it to 5k per day to be well within the law. 
There is no way to launder money on vaultoro anyway because laundering money is a circle. We are a two way Street. Bitcoin into gold and back to bitcoin. If the cops say, "where did you get your bitcoin?" you can't say vaultoro because they will just say "where did you get your bitcoin before you had it on vaultoro" 
There are billions of people who do not have the paper work to satisfy KYC regulations but they want to accept bitcoin without the extreme volatility. So we enable them to accept btc and instantly convert that value to allocated gold and convert back to bitcoin at any time. 
It also means people stay out of the debt based money paradigm which is a bonus. :)

All bitcoin lost is a gift to everyone else using bitcoin, as everyone's BTC will be worth a little more due to supply going down a little.

I agree, for sure. But what if miners refuse to signal. Maybe we should start a back up plan now. 
I really hope we can achieve a soft fork segwit. It would be brilliant. But being a business man I like to hedge resources and make sure we are successfull. It's not the technology, it's the fact that miners are sticking their heals in the ground wanting 2 MB and not budging. I really hope they come to their senses but a back up plan should be worked on, as you said it takes a long time.

Just in case you don't know what a change address is. 
And to help others reading this. 
When you send bitcoin it actually sends everything as 2 transactions. 
So say you have 10 btc and want to send 1
Then 10 btc get sent.  9 go to a change address that your wallet controls and 1 goes to whoever you paid. 
This makes it harder for analytics to track transactions through the blockchain. 
OP, once your system syncs the blockchain you should see all your change sitting there.

I think it's somewhere between the two. 
I do find it interesting that the notion of lack of jobs to pay for all these gadgets is never questioned. The celebration and fast march towards 
human obsolescence will be quicker than peoples ability to adapt. 
For instance 1.7 million people in the US alone have driving jobs. Most of these will turn into AI babysitting jobs in 5 years and in 10 years the Babysitter is no longer needed. 
This is just 1 sector. Yes everything will get cheaper but if you don't have a job you can't even afford somthing cheap. 
Digital currencies enable us to experiment with economic models on how we can fundamentally change how people survive without work. 
Steemit is very flawed but the concept of a blockchain (a digital organism) paying people for X tasks is very interesting.

There is an obituary for bitcoin that goes back 7 years.
The obituary for gold goes back 3000+ years. 
Gold has weathered everything man has thrown at it, every world war, every uncoupling. 
Everyone knows I am a bitcoin Maximalist, but I can tell you that families in India and actually most families I know would never put everything in bitcoin. 
The problem I see is that yes bitcoin will probably be "The One" but nobody knows. Many people are scared to put a large part of their life savings in such a tech. I hear, Oh what if Ethereum, Dash, Monera, X bla bla coin becomes "the One"? Us technocrats know that that is probably not going to happen but most people that don't live and breath Crypto don't know that. (People invest in onecoin for god's sake)
My point is gold is here to stay. Our Goal at Vaultoro is to be a bitcoin trojan horse for the gold bugs by providing an order book marketplace between the two private assets. So anyone can hold gold and spend it in bitcoin down to the cent.
@_date: 2017-01-13 08:35:11

No, that's why we built Vaultoro, I (Joshua Scigala CEO) lost a lot of money in the Gox collapse, and it inspired me to create the most transparent exchange in the world, where the counter asset is owned by the client, not by us. 
All gold purchased through Vaultoro is customers property. It is not Vaultoro's. We cannot speculate with our client's property, take a loan out with it as collateral, or touch it in any way. It's not ours; it's our client's.  It's Secured in the largest Top-tier vaulting facility in Europe (Pro Aurum Switzerland), Audited by BDO international and fully insured. :)
We give a real time encrypted backup of client holdings to a 3rd party law firm and a 4th party law firm has the private keys to that encrypted database of client holdings.
They have been instructed to come together to repatriate the bullion and BTC if anything happens to the company.
Our Glass Books transparency protocol is also revolutionary and forces us to always have above 100% reserve in both BTC and Gold. We hope to inspire other exchanges to follow our lead of full transparency for the company while keeping privacy for the client.
When designing Vaultoro I wanted to put in place everything I would want as an early bitcoin adopter and old school paranoid gold bug.
We started working on Vaultoro 3 years ago and launched two years ago.  People have traded millions of Euros worth of bitcoin and Physical metal.
I also got into bitcoin back in the day to get away from fiat, and it always annoyed me that people had to trade back into fiat to hedge volatility.  Enabling people to trade in and out of allocated gold instead of going back to fiat warms my heart :) 
Gold also has a way lighter KYC obligation under EU law because gold is a 'good' and not a currency. People in developing countries that don't have the paperwork to satisfy KYC needed for bitpay and other exchanges can accept Bitcoin and instantly convert to gold (up to 5K a day) and then spend that gold down to the cent as bitcoin.
We are a vert important part of the Bitcoin ecosystem for many people. :)

Anyway, like I said storage is not the problem. Network latency on big blocks is, so yes let's stay as small as possible. In fact 0 block size would be ideal. But that's impossible. But in terms of network latency it's what would work best. Going from 2 to 2mb enables us to tear down a political road block, and if at the same time we implement segwit then it's not contentious and will pass through.

Yes, we paid 0.0005 fee (45 cents) to get a client their withdrawal and it took 17 hours to clear and actually only cleared because I put it into the Viabtc transaction accelerator. 
As a bitcoin only (maximalists if you will)  business, we are starting to find it very hard. Clients get pissed off when we charge more for withdrawals, they get pissed off when it takes ages to deposit and the company gets the blame. If we raise fees, we get complaints and it totally cuts out the developing world because some people live on 5 bucks a day so a 50 cent fee is too much for them to bother. 
We need to stop bickering, and do both segwit and 2mb block size limit hard fork in one. This would make people on both sides happy and let us move on.

No, sorry for any misunderstanding, I'm saying that it's become hard to be bitcoin only because bitcoin was not meant to stop at 6 tx per second. 
LN will solve a lot of issues. Our business is really not the big picture here. The big picture is free (as in freedom) and independent electronic cash that has no central authority to shut it down, control it or steal it, is globally accesable. The native currency of the internet. We are dealing with a fundamental scaling issue and for bitcoin to be scalable we as miners, businesses and users must find compromises, especially when we have had a grid lock on the scaling issue for 3 years.

@_date: 2017-01-25 20:06:57
If we do what both camps want in a hard fork then it is not contentious. No one in there right mind would continue mining a coin that does not have segwit and a little bigger blocksize and can implement lighting network right away. The other chain would stagnate in its un scalable gridlock and die a fairly fast death. 
It would continue being developed by the core team which I think is an amazingly talented decentralised team and we move forward. 
Not doing anything is letting alts eat bitcoins lunch. 
Today there was half a billion dollars worth of transactions stuck in limbo, pissing off so many people! Having a lot of money stuck in limbo for days is very anxiety inducing. We need to scale asap. We have the tech to do so and the roadmap of segwit and LN is here. The people blocking want 2MB let's just do it and get on with competing with the ridiculous global central banking system.

@_date: 2017-01-25 18:16:05
Its like this. When you mine you take a bunch of transactions that have been collected since the last block and you try to find a sollution to a very hard problem. This problem is hard to solve but easy for others to verify that you have created a block with the correct answer to the puzzle. Think of it like a rubics cube. Hard to solve easy for everyone to look at and verify. 
NOW. 
The bottle neck is when a miner finds a Sollution, he needs to send that sollution arround the network and all the nodes that see the solution and verify it as solved drop what they are doing and start racing on solving the next block. 
NOW 
Imagine if you have a 20 Meg block. 
You send that sollution off around the network but it takes a long time because it's 20mb. If you solves the last block, you have an advantage because you can start mining on the next block right away! You have a head start on everyone else. 
This can screw the fairness because big pools that find blocks not only get the reward but they get a head start on the next block which gives them more of a chance to mine the next as well. 
There is also an issue with orphaned blocks. If two miners find a block solution at the same time it is a race to propagate the block to as many nodes as possible as fast as possible. One of them will loose that race and waist power mining in the mean time. With bigger blocks you get more orphans. 
This is the issue with having bigger blocks. 
I really think that having slightly bigger blocks is not a problem 2 or 4mb.
But that's an opinion and there are scientists with more data than me. 
I also think that slightly bigger blocks will decentralise the network of miners out of China because then the factor is not only electricity costs but also internet speed for sollution propagation. 
Again opinion. 
Were I feel I can have an opinion is in the politics. By hard forking with 2mb and segwit we are bringing both camps into one solution. No one will mine or stick to the old chain because the new one has 2mb of space plus segwit and actually also multible lightning network's.

We are a bitcoin / allocated gold order book exchange.  we have been running for 2 years and been working on it for 3.
Why trade back into back into filthy fiat when you can trade into a physical private good that you legally own and is bank independent. When you trade into fiat you trade into debt that the bank legally owns until you withdrawal.
Banks gamble with your deposits because you lend it to them, they are totally opaque so you don't know if they are one day just going to close for a bail in (Greece and Cyprus). 
We at Vaultoro connect buyers and sellers of good deliver gold that is vaulted, audited and insured in one of the largest top-tier vaulting facilities in Europe, (Pro Aurum Switzerland). You can trade down to the milligramme (about 18 cents).
All gold is the clients legal property, off our balance sheet so even if we go broke, or the euro collapses or anything else, your gold is in the Vaults and can only be accessed by you. Even liquidators could not touch our clients gold.
You can trade back into bitcoin in seconds or have gold physically delivered.
Thats what we do :)

Bitcoins don't sit in a country. There is no such thing as a bitcoin. There are only numbers on a decentralised ledger. They are not stopping people from trading into bitcoin from Yuan. Once that happened they will load up on an exchange that offers 100x madness

With all due respect this is not true. I'm not a fan of unlimited blocks because of the propagation problem, but if there was unlimited blocks miners will only accept transactions with fees to cover costs,fees will stay low because you have miners competing in price. But yeah miners will be payed.
I actually have more of an issue with fees with LN. Prices will have to sky rocket per settlement so it could eventually cost 10 bucks to load a LN channel. Where is the incentive to close and reopen and channel when  it's going to cost you 10 bucks. So what if people keep a channel open for years? I'm not sure. 
Never the less lighting network is our only true chance of truly scaling so we will have to come up with solutions but in terms of massive blocks having no fee incentive is no concern because miners decide the fee they are willing to work with.

I don't really agree, from everything I have read from people who have dedicated their lives to decentralised networks, everything points to haveing as little data as possible because messages need to propagate the network as fast as possible. A 2Mb block hardfork and Segwit is a great bridge to let both sides of the debate cross over this bridge of unupgradability

I'll tackle this. 
To create a bitcoin address you need randomness because you don't want other people to create the same key. 
But we need to take a step back. 
When bitcoin was first created, Satoshi pointed out that it's far better and more private to create a new address every time you make a transaction. 
So the original wallets would have a file called wallet.dat that stored every private key you own. When you sent a transaction it would send the bitcoin you wanted to send off, and move the rest to a new address and add the new random private key for that address to your wallet.dat file. 
The problem is that if your computer died or you lost the wallet.dat file without backing it up then your bitcoins where lost forever. 
So how do we fix this? 
Well a bitcoin address is very random and strange correct? So what if instead of every new key being random, you derived the randomness from the key before it!
So you create a chain of keys.
The problem is the first key! 
The first key has no key before it so where does it get the randomness from? 
This is where the 12 words come in! 
These twelve random words get turned into big number this big number is used as the randomness to create the first private key! :) 
We use 12 words because they are easyer than random numbers and letters to write down and just as secure. 
Check out this cartoon to see why passphrases are so much better than random passwords for humans. 
Ok to tie this all up. 
These wallets that use the 12 words are called HD wallets. That stands for hierarchical Deterministic. 
Thats because as we have learned it is a hierachy of keys derived from the one before it which is determined by an initial seed of random words. All you need are those words and you can re create an unending list of keys in order. 
:) 
Hope that helps

With all due respect, We have heard that argument for 2 years. And miners are actively blocking segwit because they want 2mb.

They don't employ all the core developers anyway, anyone in the world can contribute to the protocol. 
Actually before blockstream there was no funding for for developers at all. We had the bitcoin Foundation but that turned into a mess. Blockstream enables core Dev's to build great open score software and blockstream as a company can go to big company that wants to implement blockchain tech and say, we have the best people in the industry that can help you in your project. 
It's always good to be sceptical but it's also good to use reason and evidence instead of jumping direct to conspiracy.

I don't believe this at all. They are in competition for users value. I know ether was not built to be money but wallets like Jaxx hide the complexities of gass and smartcontracts from the user and the user can just use it as money like bitcoin.
This idea that ETH is not going after bitcoin is false. Yes we can live together but pretending that there is no competition is false.

I find it really sad that people throw around such hate and vitriol on both sides of the debate. This is a computer science project. Things should be debated with reason and evidence, not with hurtful childish insults. It doesn't matter if you want big blocks or small blocks, it doesn't even matter if you want to fork the project, that's the point of open source and it's important that people have that ability. If it's crap then people will not adopt it, that is an amazing feature. 
I hope so much that this community can stop slinging shit and get back to science, reason and evidence. 
If you don't like Roger Ver or Gavin then stop posting what they write and ignore them. Otherwise you are just posting it to stir up drama and have a good old fashioned bitching session. 
Gavin is strong minded but there are other genius developers that are amazing coders/mathematicians/cryptographers, but they have not got thick skins and not so well rounded emotionally. They can not process the hurtful hate being slung from both and or Please folks we need to as a community stop this kind of behaviour and nurture science and being excellent to each other. 
Naturally people are free to write what they want but I just hope we can regain a culture here where we as a community down vote hate and up vote science, what ever side of the block size fence you sit on.

I gave an explanation on why bigger blocks are bad here. 
Saying that, I don't think 2mb is a big problem, (sure it's not ideal, in fact 0mb blocks would theoretically be ideal in terms of latency lol.) I don't think anyone really thinks 2mb is too detramental. Most are scared of a hard fork process on this issue because the two camps have become so heavily politicised that there will most definately be two chains in a fork. 
I believe however that if we start planning a hard fork for 12 months from now that has both segwit and 2mb increase, then this would not be contentious. No one would want to follow a chain that is un-upgradeable and can not scale, when the forked chain will have both segwit, 2mb and lightning will also be ripe for main net.
I only suggest this if the segwit soft fork continues to not gain support  because of miners.
I'm a business man and like any good business we should be planning ahead. Like in chess, as many moves ahead as we can and setting up the play on two fronts.

There are so many reasons to tumble. 
You don't want your competitor to know who your supplier is or how much margin you are adding. You don't want your customer to know the same things. If you pay your friends you don't want them to know how much money you have because it can create jealousy or what ever. Employers do not want employees to know how much each are getting paid,

Its a self perpetuating autonomous digital organism that pays humans to secure it by providing it with electricity. This digital organism grows by eating data (transactions). Once eaten you can not change the data you can just read it and see when it was eaten :) 
Too meta? Ok ill break it down. 
Imagine that every 10 minutes I get a bunch of transactions or data and zip it up. Imagine that it takes a super complex password to unzip it which nobody knows as it's generated by the network. Everyone can see what's in the zip but can not change it. This is a block. Then the next ten minutes I do it again but in this next zip I also include the last zip (block). So now zips are in zips are in zips and each zip has a massive random password. The longer you wait the more secure any data is. This is because you may be able to crack the latest password to the zip but then the next one inside that needs to be cracked and so on. 
It does not work with zip files but it's a way of explaining it. It goes a lot deeper but I'll leave it at that for now. :)

Lightning networks are an open protocol, there are many implementations from many groups. They are just another way of scaling and they are very cool. I do agree with you though that we will also need a little bigger block limit. You might need to calm down on the vitriol though. The issue isn't hard drive space, the issue is when 1 block is solved it takes longer for the block to propergated across the network. During that time the miner that solved that last block has a headstart on the next one, or it is late and is orphaned. Anyway my feeling, for what it's worth, is we need both a little blocksize limit increase, segwit and lightning networks. We need it all and we needed it yesterday. But we need it as safe as possible.

Once we have both we have LN. And Segwit is cleaner as a hard fork. But I think Core devs are better to make that judgment.

Sorry, I'm no big blocker or small blocker. I'm a bitcoiner who wants to see scale, and it seems to me that doing both is a great solution.

Yes I agree, my questions is if you lose your keys or the keys to a multisig got lost then he would not be able to sell the company?
The thing is that a company is physical. If you lose the keys, the company still exists. With a currency like bitcoin, it makes sense; it's full virtual. If you lose the keys, you lose the money. But with a company, it's a bit out of wack. 
So let's say the keys to a multi-level multi-sig were lost or somehow stolen. You would still need a court to null and void that blockchain entry and issue a new entry. How do you nullify an entry if you have lost the keys and why use an immutable decentralised database if a court can overrule it anyway?

Yes I fully realise this and have been championing segwit since Eric released the paper. I love it, it's elegant and opens up a massive world of opportunity, far beyond just block size and Transaction Malleability. Unfortunately, it is being blocked by miners. If we can appease both sides of this debate then we neutralise the contentious side of a hard fork and let us have both segwit, 2mb and make way for the glorious LN

I would recommend not allowing the bot to possess tips less that 25 cents. I always found it enoying that people would tip 1 Satoshi. 
It kind of turns into a troll tip. 
I mean imagine if there was a good busker and instead of putting 25 or 50 cents in his guitar case you saw a person throwing 1 cent into the bushes next to the busker! You would think, what an asshole tipper. 
Its an insult more than anything. 
And it turnes people off when they get tipped bitcoin for the first time but can never withdrawal it because it's way below the network fee. 
Tipping is such a great way to introduce people to bitcoin, I'm looking forward to your bot!

You are very wrong, I have personally spoken to CEO'S of banks and other businesses and they have said bitcoin is not private enough. 
Money needs to be anonymous, think about it. Would you want your customers to know who your suppliers is or how much your mark-up is? Would you want your competitors to know that info? Would you want your workers to know how much you are paying each of them? 
Fungibility is important because it promotes the smooth functioning of a monetary system. If merchants have to analyze each piece of money they are offered to ascertain its legitimacy, long lineups will develop. Exchange grinds to a halt.
Not to mention that bitcoin is a push tech so you can't refuse payment first without escrow and known return address. 
Privacy will come, things like LN are an important step

I had this experience in Prague. I sent to the atm with a high fee, but then the ATM sends it again to the exchange. Only then do you get the filthy fiat. The second tx is a hard coded fee and the tx was stuck for 2 hours :/ I had someone with me and I kept on saying, it's not normally like this. Usually it's fairly fast. Sadly it's starting to be normal. We need segwit, LN and a little bigger block size limit.

I was always into alternative economies and use to keep and eye on the cypherpunk stuff. I started the first swap website in 2001 where people would swap stuff instead of using money but realised very quickly that it's way to inefficient. I found out about bitcoin at around 80 cents and then purchased at 1 buck. Lost a heap on gox and decided to show the world how transparent a bitcoin exchange can be by building vaultoro and the glass books protocol of transparency. 
Anyway. Its been the ride of my life. Some of the best minds in the world are working in this space. A mixture of math, heart and anarchy. Beautiful.

You are talking about the private audit which is performed by BDO international. BDO follows and performs ISA standards in auditing. We make the certificate public and downloadable.  
**The public audit of our books:**
Every user on [Vaultoro.com]( is given an anonymous ID that only they know.
You can then go to the [audit page]( (logged in or logged out so we don't know when you're checking) and search for your code. 
You can see that your holdings are correctly represented and can safely assume that everyone else's is also because we can't tell when people are checking it so it would be far too risky for us to fiddle the numbers.
You can then scroll down and see the sum of all our users bitcoin holdings and gold holdings.
You can then compare the bitcoin holdings to the holdings in our cold wallets and warm wallets to make sure we are fully above reserve. You can also check the sum of all gold holdings against the Vaulting operator holding statement (also published and updated weekly) to make sure they match.

No not yet, we are still figuring that out but we will email any verified New Yorkers registered on Vaultoro with instructions. New Yorkers will always be able to get hold of their savings so no need to worry.
We will not block NY IP's because we have clients from all over the world and sometimes they visit New York and want to spend their gold as bitcoin or hedge the volatility of bitcoin with gold while on holiday. Sometimes New Yorkers are in LA so IP blocking doesn't work and is nonsense. As a London company we will not be bowing down so far as to inhibit clients from all over the world because of these laughable and pathetic regulations that frankly hurt the lovely people of New York and not protect them at all.

Vaultoro is a real time trading market place for bitcoin and gold. We enable anyone to trade physical allocated gold within seconds of receiving bitcoin. Our main aim is to empower the unbanked to accept bitcoin by hedging the volatility in Gold and then instantly spending that gold globally. 
People have traded more than 21 Kilos of gold in the first 5 months and trading volume is growing by 91% per month.

If the American government really believed in freedom then they would realise that the market eventually self regulates, we at vaultoro have developed some of the most (if not the most) transparent transparency protocols because we wanted to address the gox bullshit. I got stung badly by the collapse of gox and used that as inspiration to show the world how transparent banking can and should work. Governments should do good old fashioned police work and punish those that operated a scam or defraud people, not companies that are doing everything they can in a competing market to deliver the best services to clients. Clients that are choosing to use a company because they have good internal regulations in place, choosing to do business with companies that have worked hard to service and eliminate the worries of the market place. These licences drive competition out and that is extremely bad for the consumer because this market dynamic of competing companies doing everything they can to be more transparent than the next business to gain their customers is gone. So this bull about protecting the consumer is seriously deluded and intellectually dishonest. This is about protecting large entrenched financial interests full stop. Crony capitalism at its worst. Oh and it's about Chuck Schumer's religious crusade against markets. 
People in the free world really have to think hard if they would like technological solutions to problems in a market or top down nanny state nightmare where every part of your life is controlled to protect you from your  own or other people's  lazy and fearful selves. 
To drive this home, if you sir would like companies you deal with to have licences then that's fine, companies should naturally be aloud to voluntarily get a license and proudly stick it on their homepage. This means that if you only trust sites with the bit licence sticker then only use those. But don't come at me with the gun of the state and say that I am not allowed to use a service without the sticker. Only a psychopath control freak would do that.

Wow! great work!
@_date: 2015-08-08 11:38:50
What we are trying to achive is that anyone including the 2.5 billion unbanked can use gold as a store of value and bitcoin as the currency. I got into bitcoin to escape fiat but by insta-selling bitcoin for fiat to hedge the volatility of bitcoin I'm still in the fiat world plus I put . Also with fiat you have to give so much KYC paper work but when you buy a commodity the KYC laws are much better. This means the 2.5 billion unbanked who mostly don't have the paperwork to comply with a lot of KYC regs can use bitcoin as a currency or payment network and instantly hedge in and out of gold. We also just launched a 50/50 split function on the instant orders so.  Anyway both are money / currencies which get their value from the markets and not from government. On top of that both bitcoin and gold are spent into existence and not lent into existence which is a really important point.

Thanks for your kind words. 


Will the cost to have the gold deliver decrease as the company grows? 
Yes we have plans to give different options. A large part of delivery costs is that members gold is stored in vaults that are located in duty free zone with in Switzerland. As soon as the bullion leaves the Vaulting facility it attracts Swiss taxes, then there are forming costs to melt down to requested size because the bullion are 11 to 13 kg good delivery bars, shipping and insurance then depending on where it's being deliver more taxes from the receiving countries. 
We where primarily a trading platform to secure your wealth for you and give you the tools to instantly spend that value using the magic of Bitcoin. 
We offer physical delivery as a service because it is your gold so you can do what you want but yes it's an expensive way to touch your gold. 
If people need physical delivery at a good cost we recommend selling your gold in the vault for bitcoin and instantly sending that value across borders to buy gold at a local gold dealer that hopefully accepts bitcoin. 
In the future we want to set up partnerships with bullion dealers around the world to do the above step for you with a couple of clicks. 


Yes and unlike a lot of other gold vaulting facilities it is 100% insured.


Absolutely, a super easy to use mobile app is on the way. Not only that but merchant POS system as well. 
The 2.5 billion unbanked don't have the option to insta-sell using bitpay to lock in value. To help that we want to enable the unbanked to accept bitcoin and instantly hedge the volatility in gold without a bank account and then instantly send that value off globally with bitcoin.

Joshua Scigala here from  
We were and still are the only true bitcoin / physical gold orderbook trading platform.
We spent a long time working with various ideas on how to bring gold back as a usable global currency. 
While the idea of a gold backed cryptographically secure token to represent a gram of gold is great it bumps up against a few problems.
1) Physical storage and insurance costs. You can have a token backed by gold but it costs you to prove purity, secure the metal and insure it. This cost would have to come out of the token that is being passed around the economy. This cost can technically be taken from the coin which would be in the form of a demurrage. The problem is people don't like when the money they are holding losses value over time.
2) Legal issues. By issuing a token to back the gold in a vault you are effectively becoming a money issuer. This is highly illegal in most countries (ludacris I know but it is a what it is) and was the reason e-gold got shut down.
What we are doing is outsourcing the currency to bitcoin as that is not issued by anyone. We enable anyone to instantly buy gold and spend it as bitcoin effectively combining the historical stability of gold with the speed and transparency of the bitcoin blockchain.
We use the blockchain to have proof of above 100% reserve of both bitcoin and gold.
By combining bitcoin and gold we believe we have an almost perfect form of money.
If you have any questions feel free to AMA me.

And  because we are a bitcoin / gold exchange. Gold is a good and not a currency. We take aml KYC docs after 5k a day. The thing is you can't "launder" money through us anyway unless you take physical delivery in which case we take full KYC /AML.  We can do 5k a day because in the EU you can buy 7500 euros worth of a good per day without handing over ID. This is important because imagine all the identity theft if everyone had to hand over their ID to every shop they purchased some goods from.

Actually, the main reason we take KYC is for insurance. It has to be with all amounts.
The thing is that most people upload KYC compliant paperwork without needing to because all gold is secure in the client's name as their property in a bailment contract. This is much safer then securing your gold under the property of an email address. If the client was to pass away for instance then it would get expensive for the estates management to prove that the email address belonged to the deceased clients state management would have to prove that wich could be costly.

Yes and no, multisig (BIP0011) is one of the largest steps forward in bitcoin security we have had.  Bitfinex did not have true multisig, they had set the 3rd party to just sign anything (now that's crazy) 
Anyway, even if business is the main use case (which it is not) why does that matter, it was business that brought email to the main stream. And bitcoin is money remember so businesses better make it secure. 
Use cases other than business. (from bitcoin wiki) 
1-of-2: Husband and wife petty cash account — the signature of either spouse is sufficient to spend the funds.
2-of-2: Husband and wife savings account — both signatures are required to spend the funds, preventing one spouse from spending the money without the approval of the other
2-of-2: One wallet is on your primary computer, the other on your smartphone — the funds cannot be spent without a signature from both devices. Thus, an attacker must gain access to both devices in order to steal your funds (much more difficult than one device)
2-of-3: Parents’ savings account for child — the kid can spend the money with the approval of either parent, and money cannot be taken away from the child unless both parents agree
Here are where businesses come in. 
2-of-3: A board of three directors maintaining funds for their organization — those funds cannot be spent unless any two of those directors agrees. Bigger multi-signature transactions are possible for bigger organizations, such as 3-of-5, 5-of-9, etc.
2-of-3: Buyer-seller escrow: buyer commits money into a 2-of-3 transaction with the seller and a third-party arbitrator. If transaction goes smoothly, then both buyer and seller sign the transaction to forward the money to the seller. If something goes wrong, they can sign a transaction to refund the buyer. If they cannot agree, they both appeal to the third-party who will arbitrate and provide a second signature to the party that it deems deserves it. 
On top of that, multisig also enable payment channels.

Bit off topic sorry but in Germany it's cap gains free just like gold if you hold it for more than a year. Also they just released tax info that if you use crypto as money then it's also tax free! This is great for the German users of our exchange as their gold is tax free. 
It will be interesting to see if other countries also adopt such liberal tax laws. I think we might see many rich crypto holders moving to Gemany and spending money here.

Satoshi wrote the original white paper and open source code. Since then there has been so much work done on the original protocol that 95% of the code has been rewrite. You can even use diferant implementations of the protocol like libbitcoin. 
But let's say the impossible happened then he would take everyone's bitcoin and the price would drop to zero faster than the speed of light.

I also know of lots of gold and silver bugs starting to see the benefits of backing their bitcoin with gold. When we started developing Vaultoro the gold bugs we know (and we know a lot) where all sceptical but after half an hour I can usually blow their mind with the potential of bitcoin.

When we first started developing vaultoro.com we where looking into how we could build a decentralised exchange. The problem is that they end up being slow. To slow for a good price discovery engine. And the Gold is centrally secured anyway. This is important for auditing purposes. Instead we built vaultoro as a standard exchange but with radical transparency. We as a community must demand radical transparency from centralised exchanges. We have a great system and we hope that other exchanges will take our lead.

We at vaultoro.com do not need any personal details until you want to deposit more than 5K per day. This is because we let people trade between Bitcoin and gold that is secured in their name as their property. Gold is considered a good and not a currency and under European law you can buy up to 7500 euros worth of a good per day without having to hand over all your personal details. We dropped it to 5K dollars worth of BTC to be well within the law. We do recommend people verify them selves however before that maximum is reached because the Gold is their property and if something was to happen to them then it can get expensive for their estates  management to prove that the email address registered belonged to the estate. It's also good if the user loses their 2 factor and reset code and so on because they can prove who they are.

Great work mate, keep up the good work
@_date: 2016-10-03 10:40:17
First, I like youre writing style, keep it up. But... 
A: please call it a blockchain or the blockchain or blockchains or blockchain technology. Don't worry you're not the only one that just says blockchain but it's Wierd. We don't say "I use database"
Blockchain good, bitcoin bad. = poker good, playing cards bad. It doesn't make sense.
The blockchain is very cool but really, you need the whole deal. Proof of work, is never mentioned by this whole banking industry take over (Tim Swanson's wet dream). Proof of work is only able to keep the blockchain going because miners perform the proof of work, they only do this because they get paid by the network with tokens that have value as currency. It's a finely tuned bunch of incentives that make up this self perpetuating digital organism we call the bitcoin network. It's the first digital self perpetuating organism that pays humans to secure it. 
The media is obsessed about the blockchain but bitcoin as a decentralised money is, in my eyes, one of the most important discoveries of not only our time but the last 100 years.
Everyone on on the planet uses money everyday from cents to billions. 
I created the fist swap site in the early 2000s where women all over the world could swap clothes with each other. Cool idea but totally inefficient. So many deals fell through because someone didn't like what the other party had. With a token of value you get to pick from everyone in the economy, not just the counter party. Money brings fluidity but is very dangerous when mismanaged by a central authority! 
Bitcoin is the first true way of the globe having a predictable, uncorruptible money supply. 
Money is way way way more important than enabling Gucci to trace thier shitty handbags and prove that it's not fake through a "blockchain" that is probably not even a real blockchain. It's more important than central banks saying they use blockchain technology to make thier shitty system of debt from thin air more efficient. 
Anyway please keep writing, I don't mean to bring you down. Just wanted to point it out because I'm sick of hearing about how the blockchain is so great but how bitcoin is meh.
Bitcoin is fucking amazing!

If I wasn't being the CEO of  I would create a bitcoin atm network that was it's own exchange network. Please run with the idea if you want. 
Atm 1 is running low on cash but has a heap of btc. 
Atm 2 is down the road and is running low of bitcoin but has a lot of cash. 
Atm 1 makes it cheaper to buy bitcoin than Atm 2 so atm2 tells clients (either by app or on screen) hey if you go down the road to atm1 we will sell you bitcoin cheaper! 
And the opposite happens on atm1, message says "oh you want to sell your bitcoin for cash? We will give you a better price up the road at atm2.
This way you are decentralising the need for restocking. This would be great in places like Greece when banks shut down. 
The network would be its own price discovery system and people would see arbitrage opportunities and refill your machines for you. 
Have fun and feel free incorporate the vaultoro api so people can hedge price volatility in gold. :)

I want to write the problem in plane English for people. When a miner finds a 100mb block, it has to tell the network, so it starts to send the block around to the other miners to build on top of. By the time the rest of the miners have the 100mb bock and verified it, the original miner who created the last block has already started mining the next one. 
This means that the miner has a head start and more likely to win the next block too. 
This is a real concern for bigger blocks  but it might have a surprising decentralising effect as mining shifts out of slow internet counties as fast internet speed becomes as important as cheep electricity costs.
I really love the idea of payment channels but I still have some concerns. 
I share the fee concern, where payment channel operators take fees away from miners. People say that main chain will go up in price and that's fine but then payment channel ops might centralise because it's hard and risky to run a profitable payment channel. 
I also have concerns that payment channels will centralise to the ones that have the largest liquidity. I would love to see some simulations to see if this is realistic.
The Last concern I have is the ability for governments to regulate large backbone payment channel operators and inforce KYC for anyone wanting to onramp into that channel.
On and off ramps are also wacky. If I want to use a payment channel do I have to pay the mega on chain fee to get into the LN? I guess most bitcoin will stay in the lightning network and only the fees will hit the main chain eventually. But then does that make cold wallets a thing of the past as you have to store your coins in a channel, does that create counter party risk for long term storage in LN? 
Excuse my ignorance if this is all not an issue.

Some things like real time price discovery exchanges are not going to be able to be made decentralised but strong competition is a kind of primitive decentralisation. This is why over regulation could be a bad thing for bitcoin because it usually does nothing more than lock competition out.

Yes, we are an order book exchange but currently, we only trade bitcoin and Physical gold. 
Many traders use us to take profits off the table and secure them in gold while they sleep so they get a good nights rest before trading back to crypto again.
I lost a lot of money in MtGox because they had no transparency and the counter asset was fiat which is on the companies balance sheet so liquidators are eating all that up too. 
Gold purchased on Vaultoro is allocated to your name as your legal property, and not on our company balance sheet. This means that not even liquidators could touch our client's property is we didn't manage our business properly. 
I wanted to build the world's most transparent exchange and have a counter asset fully owned by our clients. and so we built Vaultoro. 
2.5 years on and we have clients hodling more than 150 Kilos of allocated physical gold, in one of the highest security rated Vaulting facilities in Europe (only matched by the vaults at the European central bank), Fully audited by one of the largest auditing firms in the world (BDO international) and insured against theft. Never fiat ;)

It makes us lazy. Merchant adoption and closing the loop will drive value into the network and not just out.

Fair enough, I also hold physical gold but we developed  to help back bitcoins value in gold not fiat. I got into bitcoin to exit fiat and so don't want to use fiat to hedge against the volatility. Gold also doesn't attract the draconian KYC stuff as much so it lets bitcoin enter developing countries by allowing people to trade in bitcoin and lock in value as gold. A lot of people in developing countries could not get the needed KYC paperwork to hold FIAT because they don't have it. They want to use bitcoin to enter the global market but can't risk the volatility so gold is a great way to do that.

That was very very very early days when &lt;1000 people knew about bitcoin. Everyone decided that this was a bug and upgraded their bitcoind nodes. This can not happen anymore. We can see how hard it is to change even the blocksize limit. Bitcoin is now fully immutable. It's like saying that back in 1656 we got 51% of people (around 510 people) in the tiny new settlement called New York to voluntarily wear fur coats. Because of that, it should be possible to get 51% of the 8.5million living in New York now days to voluntarily wear fur coats. 
It's not going to happen because there are so many diferant opinions and needs out there all playing with the same finely tuned game theory Satoshi constructed.

It will not be one or the other, it will be a mix, if it's a small amount of cash then the banks would use the bitcoin protocol as they don't need much liquidity. The receiving bank could cash out very fast, without to much volatility exposure.

I (Joshua Scigala) am a bitcoin maximalists as well but we opened  because gold has been in the human psyche for over 3000 years as money. While I understand and trust the math of bitcoin, many still do not. There is also an issue of wich crypto projects to hold your value in. Will ether beat bitcoin, will litecoin? I don't think they will nock out btc but many other people will think like that. With Vaultoro, people can jump in and out of real allocated gold without touching fiat and they can do it instantly. So unbanked can accept bitcoin payments and instantly hedge that in private gold, then spend that gold as bitcoin when needed.
In fact I feel that bitcoin is giving gold relevancy again, because bitcoin is so fast, transparent and easy to send but young and volatile, while gold is heavy, hard to move around, hard to verify but has held value fairly stable for over 3000 years. By combining them, I feel we are getting close to perfect asset based money. 
I see a bright future for both.

I guess only time will tell but you have to remember that all banks need to switch for it to work and an permissionless open score money protocol that anyone can work on or accept without contract is pretty sweet especially when others start interfacing to it then you might as well too. There where also private messaging companies but banks jumped on to use the open email  protocol because of the network effect.

Thanks for coming onto Reddit and sharing. We (vaultoro) just came back from the BBVA fintech awards where we and 2 other bitcoin companies where in the finals so it shows that other banks are thinking the same thing. 
I have to say though that fractional reserve banking is a scourge and bitcoin goes a long way to stopping this disgusting practice of creating money out of thin air and charging Interest on it. Bitcoin (like gold) are rare numbers that are found and spent into existence. We at vaultoro have built proof of reserves so we can not be under without someone noticing. 
Old school banks days are numbered if they stick with their old model of making piles of money lending money they don't have on fractional reserves. They will still be usefull in other scenarios but just like voip disrupted phone companies, the bitcoin protocol is disrupting banking cash cow streams.

Well done guys! I would love love love to see it evolve to where the network of ATM's would be the exchange. So if one machine is being used to much to buy BTC then the price would go up at that machine and another machines prices would go down. You could have an app that shows you the diferant prices and you travel to the cheapest if that is worth it to you. The machines would have to be 2 way but it would be absolutely fantastic! That way the machines would kind of become a decentralised exchange.

Free market economics does not allow for monopolies. Monopolies tend to get slow and expensive and have no need to become better through lack of competition.

heheh, Yeah but we literally just came back from being finalists at the BBVA fintech awards for what we are doing with Vaultoro.com, the BBVA are the second biggest bank in spain and the biggest in south america, they invested in coinbase. One of the biggest problems they have is international transfers. Consumers are demanding cheaper and faster international transfers but some small regional bank in India does not have agreements with a bank in spain or the US. Banks around the world use the 6 degrees of separation type deal where they send to a bank that they have an agreement with who takes a cut and forwards it on to another bank they have an agreement with that sends to another bank that they an agreement with the final destination bank. They all take their time and a cut.
Bitcoin is mathematically extremely secure. Now if two banks officially transact and accept bitcoin for international transfers to happen (without the client knowing) a bank could buy bitcoin locally, send it around the world to the "untrusted bank" as it's a trustless network and that bank would sell the coins locally for fiat. Even with 6 confirmations it's way cheaper and faster. In the beginning the bank could charge the client the same or a little less than everyone else for the service and pocket any win from not having to pay 3 intermediaries. It will happen. The old banking protocols are all based on trust and international contracts which are extremely costly to set up and keep track of. Banks will use bitcoin. The talks I was having with executives all pointed to this eventuality. 
We saw phone companies in the 90s do the same. When you made an international call it could connect through multiple companies that had contracts, the call would echo and cost an arm and a leg because to call USA to Australia you would actually be using the phone lines! Then one smart company said hey if we make a local call, convert to VOIP, send it to Germany and then make another local call then it will be far cheaper for us, quality will be better and bang you had a revolution in telephony.
Bitcoin is the trustless conduit and people won't even know they are using it.

The problem I saw there is that what ever gets talked about, turns into a conversation about the blocksize limit. Every time. It's gets borring fast.

We at vaultoro.com have had a protocol we developed called glass books. Basically we give everyone an anonymous ID and then publish every ID (logged out so we don't know that they are checking) and how much every ID has in bitcoin and gold. 
You can see the sum of all user holdings and check that against the published multisig cold wallet addresses and a warm wallet address  Which duplicates what we have in our thousands of hot wallets into 1 warm . 
For the gold we publish the vaulting facility statements, the BDO international audit certificates and insurance certificates. 
By us publishing every anon ID we can not cheat the numbers because someone could notice. 
I (Joshua Scigala co-founder of Vaultoro) got stung big time by gox and so wanted to build the most transparent exchange possible while keeping user data ad private as possible. 
Gold is also a really good store of value and bitcoin is fantastic at moving it. :)

Vaultoro.com is already pushing the boundaries of transparency in the bitcoin exchange industry and now with this factom deal vaultoro will be the most transparent exchange in the world. We will be pushing an anonymised string of every trade into the blockchain. If we as a community and industry don't want overarching and draconian regulations then we as an industry have to show that we can move a large part of regulation to math. We now have massive transparency while keeping privacy sacred.

Blockchains are only useful if they are decentralised. Everything else is just buzzwords using the word blockchain instead of database to sound hip, cool and up with the times.

No unfortunately we do not accept outside gold. We looked into it but smelting Costs and purity control would have been to expensive. Vaultoro is like any other exchange but for gold. We buy investment grade bullion and store it in top tier Swiss vaults (pro Aurum). We act as market maker as thousands of people buy parts of the bar. We are a market so once someone has gold they can sell it to someone else. This is important because unlike brokers, if some one buys a heap of gold and we make the buy back price more expensive others will see the opportunity and jump in front of us to offer a better price. This creates a true price discovery system for bitcoin based on a non debt based commodity. 
I (Joshua Scigala) got stung by  MtGox and this inspired me to create a radically transparent exchange. Our transparency protocols are second to none and manage to keep our users private while proving full reserves in both bitcoin and gold. 
I feel that the awful Fractional reserve banking era is coming to an end. I feel that bitcoin has finally made gold really useful again. Useful for what it has always been useful for, backing currency. There has been 1.5 million dollars worth of gold traded in the first 8 months of being live and we are growing by 64% ave/month :)

Joshua from  here.  To your point on how hard it would be to get rid of them, you don't have to. We enable you to escape the price volatility of bitcoin but not having to sell your coins to fiat. With vaultoro you convert your bitcoin to investment grade assigned gold to escape the price volatility from anywhere in the world. The gold is secured in your name as your property so even if something was to happen to us as a company, your gold is sitting in the top-tier Swiss vault run by one of Europe's largest private vaulting firms (pro-aurum, audited by BDO international ) , no one can touch it but you. 
We started vaultoro to enable people to instantly convert to gold and instantly spend that gold as bitcoin again, all with just email and password. This way you never have to sell your bitcoin back to fiat. 
Exit debt based money.  Next step try to get suppliers to accept bitcoin :) and use bit wage to pay your workers
Just like Paolo, if you have any questions feel free to pm me here or email me joshua

At the end of the day, Bitcoin is an open protocol and this cult of personality and people caring so much about individuals is what hurts us all.

Its true, I went to an anarchist book shop in San Fran and asked in all excitement oh cool can I pay for this in bitcoin? He looked up at me with distain and said no. I said why? He said because publishers don't take it.  I said they don't have to yet and have you asked them? Even if they don't you can instantly convert some or all of it to dollars if you want. He shrugged and went back to reading his revolutionary Emma Goldman book. I looked at him sadly and said you know that bitcoin  is actually one of the most evolutionary steps and one of the most promising steps that has happened in the freedom / anarchy movements in a long time, since it is the first stateless and rulerless currencies known to man. He just looked at me with a bored look over his glasses and then looked back at his book. Oh man it was frustrating. I walked out. Typical red black "anarchist" I thought. I don't mean to group people but generally people that identify with ancap (yellow black)  philosophical thinking seem to more consistent.

yes, naturally, you can pick up or get it delivered as it is your property. But we were not set up for a cheap way to buy gold you secure at home. We were set up as a full order book exchange so that people can quickly jump in and out of an allocated asset without much counterparty risk. 
Saying that we have partnered with Roberts and Roberts in the US so when we get a physical withdrawal to the states, we sell the bullion in the Pro Aurum Vaults in Switzerland for BTC, and send the bitcoin to Roberts and Roberts where they send it locally. That removed a massive amount of cost and customs paperwork. 
We are now working on partnering with other dealers around the world to do the same. :)

We always wanted to figure out how to create an internal blockchain type of checksum for withdrawal and trade requests where vaultoro would check a users holdings back through all trades up to where they deposited the bitcoin. We also wanted a way to solidify an anonymised undeniable history of trades so that the public audit has a further layer of transparency and accountability. 
Factom took the workload of creating that from scratch from us and is making it easy for us to implement the transparency we want to see in the industry. 
We heard their talk at the inside bitcoins conference in Berlin and thought wow thats what we have been wanting to build internally. Our CTO went through their technology and saw how perfect it is to implement what we wanted to implement. Talks started and the rest is history.
We are always striving to create the most secure, transparent and provably solvent exchange possible. By incorporating an immutable database like bitcoin's blockchain we will not only have everything we want but everything the community deserves in an exchange.

Do you have the right to hold money that has no intrinsic debt or do you only have the right to use money they print out of thin air, lent into the world with interest attached? That's the big question. 
@_date: 2015-02-14 02:20:48
We have thought long and hard on how to do this and think we have come up with a really elegant solution.
Every user is listed in a public ledger but anonymised. Every user knows their own secret anonymous code (client ID) and can check if they are on the public audit ledger.
Next to their anonymous code is both their bitcoin holdings and gold holdings.
If someone looks and they are not on the list or their balance is wrong they will scream and shout about it all over the Internet warning everyone else of the discrepancy.
If your account checks out you can then scroll down to the bottom of the public ledger and see the sum of every users holdings. You can then easily check that amount against the letter (PDF) from our vault operator about how much gold is in the vault. You can then check the letter from the auditor (BDO) that everything is accounted for. After that you can then also check the Letter from the insurance company stating that all gold held by our vault operator is fully insured :)
I am an old paranoid gold bug and have put in place every check and balance I would want as a customer to make sure I am safe, secure and at peace.
By holding gold through vaultoro no one can rob you like they can at home. You have access to world-class bullion vaulting security that only large investors usually have access to and for the fraction of the price. :) Also to hold gold in these facilities one usually needs vast amounts of money to make it economically viable. At Vaultoro it becomes viable not only for normal people but also people in developing countries that only want to hold milligrams! This could never happen before, It means that people in developing countries can now trade in bitcoin and convert to private investment grade gold to secure them of the bitcoin volatility.  All made possible through the power and beauty of the bitcoin network. 
It’s all very exciting. Love the agility of bitcoin and love the stability of gold.

I think a better idea is to work on a true phone to phone mesh net.  And bitcoin could be used to pay people that want to be exit nodes that give the whole mesh net access to the wider net. You won't see much uptake until a major event like a demonstration where they cut off internet. But music festivals and so on would also love it. 
Part of this would be mesh chat, a mesh reddit, mesh decision polling/voting, mesh VoIP, and so in. 
You could have it all free and you only pay bitcoin if you want to access outer Web info through an exit node. This payment  would be automatically split up and paid to all the exits weighted towards the nodes that are delivering the most bandwidth and helping connect the mesh.

Yes, simply click on the audit page when logged in. there you will see all gold held by every member, this is anonymised but each member can check if they are on the list and that their standing is correct and the sum can be checked against our gold holding list from our supplier which is also published on that page.
@_date: 2015-02-13 16:36:23
very good question, at first we looked at developing a decentralised exchange solution but they are slow and cumbersome, and gold has to sit somewhere and is by nature centralised. So we decided to develop a super fast price discovery system instead.
To deal with goxing situation we have one of the largest Auditing firms in the world BDO auditing our gold reserves.
For the bitcoin we anonymise every account and publish how much each account holds, both in bitcoin and in gold. 
everyone can check themselves and let everyone else know if there is a discrepancy. :) 
We then publish all cold wallet addresses so that our books are always glass :) and people can check that our cold and warm wallets are equal to or greater than the sum of our users holdings.
I don't know why more exchanges aren't doing this. The blockchain is perfect for public scrutiny so we are using it to it's full potential.

Thanks! :) us too, we have kept that in the back of our minds as well while designing vaultoro. I think I speak for all of us in the bitcoin community when I say that we are all sick and tired of dodgy firms and really there is no need for them to exist if we as a community demand better! No need to wait for corruptible for regulations! We the consumers are the regulations! don't do business with exchanges that are anonymous, don't store your wealth with exchanges that don't use the clarity and transparency of the blockchain to prove solvency. 
So I would take the "if you don't hold the keys..." saying further to also say if you don't demand better corporate governance or better auditing and transparency then don't do business with them. This is super important in truly free markets. If we all want bitcoin or the concept of "be your own bank" to work we must demand better and support businesses that lead the way. :)

On a historical time scale it's pretty stable when measured against other commodities.

The European regulations state that customer identification must be taken for high value goods from €﻿7,500﻿ euro and up per day.
To ensure that Vaultoro is well within the Law we have capped deposits of unverified users to $﻿5000 USD per day. This limit is reset every 24 hours.
On the deposit page Vaultoro will display how much in bitcoin you are able to send before you reach the daily limit. If you exceed your daily limit Vaultoro has to freeze your account until you verify it. 
To verify yourself you need to use the secure submission form to submit a copy of your passport or government issued ID (drivers licence) and a recent utility bill.
We highly recommend people verify their accounts anyway so that the gold is stored in their legal name and not just their email. 
0.0002 bitcoin (around 3 cents) and 1milligram on the gold side :)

Thanks :) Yeah that was sad to see then remove gold. We fee that the guys at netagio had a very large minimum buy order and the exchange wasn't real time. But thats just a guess.
Anyway we feel passionate about letting people hold and spend private money like bitcoin and gold. Money that is spent into existence not lent into existence like government backed currencies are. :)
@_date: 2015-02-14 00:29:59
Sadly at the moment no, We only deal in good delivery investment grade gold. It is far to expensive for us (and you) to send us your gold, us check it for purity, we need to then melt it down and combine it into 100g bars. It is far better for you to sell it locally for bitcoin and then use that bitcoin then use that to trade with on vaultoro.com

The Minimum physical withdrawal is 100grams.
Although Vaultoro is not primarily designed as a gold withdrawal system but rather a trading platform, Vaultoro offers the service of physical withdrawal for but not limited to
* Clients that wish to take physical possession of their gold holdings for any reason
* To highlight that we run at or above full gold reserves at all time
* In case of mass systemic failure or an international crisis and users want to collect the wealth held in bailment by Vaultoro

@_date: 2015-02-24 15:11:57
Yes absolutely, but you can only pick it up in Switzerland. Also because the gold leaves the duty free zone there will be a tax from the government that will need to be paid and there is a minimum withdrawal of 100g because of the amount of security protocols that need to happen to do this safely. But yes it is very much possible.

Great book "confessions of an economic hitman" but bringing down a country with fiat credit is different to disrupting a free anarchic market. 
My feeling is that it's not someone trying to Fuck bitcoin but rather some very wealthy companies or individuals that want the price down so they can stack up before a moon shot. Saying that, it's a really risky and difficult thing to do even with a small market cap so it's probably a mixture of people trying to manipulate down as well as the market actually coming down from a speculation are hype in law 2013.

We are a start up and of course, we are paying our developers with our funding money. We do everything to be as transparent as possible for example showing all our cold and warm wallets, the top-tier Vaulting Facility statements, BDO international auditing certificates and insurance papers.
Of course, you have to trust an exchange with your funds, but we do everything possible to minimise the amount of trust needed.
We have been in the bitcoin space for a very long time, and our goal is to build a long-term quality business that will help push asset based money forward.
If you have suggestions on how we could improve, please let us know. We are always open to suggestions.
Edit: I just wanted to add that all gold is sourced and secured by one of the largest gold vaulting facilities in Europe, Pro Aurum AG. 
The auditor is BDO international who audits the vaults for the metal held, both amount and purity. BDO international is one of the largest auditing firms in the world with a 7 billion revenue in 2014.
Also, unlike fiat exchanges, all our clients gold is off our books, we can not gamble, with it or use it in any way and even if we miss manage our business and go bankrupt Liquidators could not touch our clients gold. This is much safer than fiat exchanges.
Yes we promote people to be their own bank too, we are bitcoin maximalists. Our aim with Vaultoro is to enable the underbanked accept bitcoin and hedge volatility in gold and then spend that gold as bitcoin again. This is important because gold is a good and not a currency so they do not have as strong KYC regulations wich most underbanked do not have the paperwork to satisfy.

England didn't dodge that many bullets, London is becoming so crazy expensive now.

Onecoin will bite bitcoin in the ass really badly if we as a community don't expose them. This is because when this discusting onecoin ponzy scam comes tumbling down, regulators all over the world will say onecoin = bitcoin and that they need to protect people. They will comedown on every business that deals with blockchain assets with killer regulations that will only protect the incumbent banking system. 
Onecoin is taking good, trusting, unfortunately not to bright people and stealing their money. 
It's really awfull to see. 
I really hope you (OP) can 
A: convince your family members to see the scam. 
B: get their money back somehow. 
I'm sorry to hear that so many people are falling for this scamcoin.  It saddens me because it will hurt hundreds of thousands of people who were willing to take the step and try digital currencies but it will also hurt bitcoin itself due to being a digital coin.

TcpIP is out of their control too. They don't need to control it. Internal blockchains are just pointless. If they control all the hashing then inserts can be reversed so they might as well use a standard very fast database. Bitcoin is the most secure real blockchain because of the crazy amount of hashing power backing it. They will end up using bitcoin to send international wires to cut out all middle banks even though they themselves make money on being an intermediary. They can't help it because consumers can do it themselves with bitcoin so if they don't keep up with the price and speed they will be left behind. They will assimilate into bitcoin. If not bitcoin then some other public ledger. Internal blockchains make no sense and are just a buzzword like cloud is to server.

Gold is accepted globally as value and has throughout history. It is however very heavy and impractical to move around. That's why it makes for a good match. 
Gold = price stable over centuries but heavy and hard to move
Bitcoin = price volatile (for now) but super easy and fluid to move around. 
Combine, mix and serve as a great way to store and spend wealth globally. :)

The Auditor is BDO, one of the largest and most respected auditing firms in the world. They have far more to lose than they could ever gain by lying for us or our vault operator. Which is what we want. We don't want people to have to trust us. 
This is what all exchanges should be doing and I think they eventually will because government regulations are to slow (not to mention corruptible) to keep up with the fast evolution of the bitcoin world but the free market (the bitcoin community ) should and does demand better and I personally demand better. So proper 3rd party auditing, and public blockchain scrutiny is our number 1 priority.

Our lawyers have advised us that there really is no effect to Vaultoro or its clients, but we will be keeping a close eye on it. If something arises then we can move the entity fairly quickly to a more favourable jurisdiction. The good thing about Vaultoro is that members gold is off our books it's fully owned by the member. 
I personally don't think Brexit will happen anyway. The referendum is non-binding.

Yes but he has one of the few exchanges that has not jumped on the altcion bandwagon to offer all these confusing alts to the market. He has always been a bitcoin maximalist. I don't like all this bullying people do to people that have a different views on how to scale. Coinbase has done more for onboarding people to bitcoin than most. So yes he can be a little agravating and I don't like the ridicules KYC and coin following they do but I blame American politics and obsession with putting as many people behind bars as possible more than I blame coinbase.

Re bank statement, unfortunately we have been advised that it has to be a scanned utility bill no older than 3 months.
We know it's a hassle but it's the law. 
We do highly recommend people fully verify them selves anyway because the gold is fully your property held in your name, so if something was to happen to you it could get expensive for your estates management to prove it is your gold. We do have protocols in place but yeah it's always prudent when investing to have everything in your verifiable full name (see  )

Hi Oshirowanen,
At the end of the month, we take a small fee for storage and insurance from every user in gold. If a users gold is "in trading" then we can not take the fee from the open order and so the system subtracts the fee in bitcoin. In some edge cases where the user has no bitcoin it will go into negative until their order is filled and the bitcoin gets paid. This is the most fair system we came up with because we don't want to mess with users open orders.

Hi, thanks for the questions and comments,
Circle is not a competitor of ours, I actually like and trust the company, they have a stellar team and good reputation. You can not buy bitcoin on Vaultoro and so I have recommended coinbase and circle to people that have asked how to get bitcoin. I am simply saying that transparency is a must for all bitcoin companies post Gox as we now have the tools to do cryptographic or obfuscated proof of reserve so everyone should implement it. If we do not voluntarily make ourselves transparent, and another gox happens then, regulators will come down on everyone in the space and make it hard for startups to bootstrap into the industry. I actually want more competition because it helps educate the market and there is plenty of room for many.
On our public audit page, you can see how many customers we have and exactly how much gold and bitcoin they own. We also publish our cold and warm wallet addresses, gold vaulting statements, BDO international auditing certificates and insurance certificates. 
Re E-gold:
Vaultoro is very different. E-gold was minting their own currency, by enabling people to send a digital token backed by gold to other people. Doing so is illegal in most countries. They also did not work with allocated gold.
Vaultoro is very different. We are basically a gold shop. The only difference to a traditional gold shop is that we are super fast and global because of bitcoin, and we are a marketplace so we can not set the price. People can not send gold to a particular person on Vaultoro and they can not launder money through Vaultoro. They can just buy allocated gold held in their name as their legal property and then sell that gold back for bitcoin instantly. 
The next point is important.
All gold is allocated and secured in one of the largest most respected vaulting facilities in Europe (Pro Aurum). This means that all gold held by our users is not on the vaultoro books because it does not belong to us, it belongs to our clients. We can not gamble with it or do anything with it. All we can do is facilitate the trade back and forth into bitcoin. Even if vaultoro was miss managed our went bankrupt, vaultoro liquidators could not touch our clients gold because it is nothing to do with us. We are not custodians. 
Re, In case we go under, I was super paranoid as an old gold bug, so as the CEO, I set up vaultoro how I would like to see an allocated gold company should work. A third party law firm gets an almost real-time encrypted backup of every client's holding. A fourth party law firm has the private key to that encrypted backup. They have been instructed to come together in case anything happens to Vaultoro like upper management is killed in a plane crash or bankruptcy. The 3rd Party law firm is then in charge of repatriating all assets.
Vaultoro is a limited company based in London due to regulatory reasons and to be close to the professional bullion markets.
We develop out of Berlin and work with Pro Aurum Switzerland.
Re typos, I am very sorry, and thanks for pointing is out. English was not my first language so I can not see some errors. Being a lean startup, we have focused all our energy on security and adding useful features, but you are 100% correct that it does not inspire confidence when you see typos, and I will be sure to get someone onto proofreading the entire site. It would help us out if you could send me a PM with some of the errors you found.
Re gox, 
This is a very important question and something I want to fix for the whole industry.
We are currently building a system that will make a goxing impossible. I will openly say it here as I would like other companies to do the same and we will open source the tech once completed.
We will be inserting every deposit, trade and withdrawal into a blockchain and create a multi-sig hot wallet where a bot has the third key. 
When a withdrawal is requested, the bot will check the blockchain to make sure the member has more than or equal to on deposit as the amount of funds they are trying to withdrawal.
Once it can mathematically verify this, the bot will sign the withdrawal.
This means that no internal or external hacker can sweep the entire wallet. It will not stop individual accounts being hacked and swept, but we offer 2FA and locked payout addresses to help mitigate that.
Thanks for the great questions and I'm sorry if I sound like I was bad mouthing another business in this space. Someone asked me what I thought of circles transparency, and I simply wanted to say that they should do a better job with that particular aspect of their business. As I would rather mathematical proof of reserve than trust.
