Damn, TIL atomic weight =/= density for metals.
For those curious, metals other than tungsten that are denser than gold:
* Osmium
* Iridium: more expensive than gold
* Platinum: more expensive than gold
* Plutonium: more expensive than gold, plus it kills you

Regardless of what your opinion on Segwit2X is, Coinbase shouldn't be trusted.
Take a look at r/Coinbase. The only way you can get them to even just respond when your account gets locked or a deposit is lost is by filing a complaint with the government and forcing them to respond by the legal deadline.
I withdrew Litecoin and the transaction wasn't processed for 2 months. Makes me think they're playing fractional reserve games and are sometimes short on coins.

You can purchase with a credit/debit card, but there will generally be a 3% fee to cover those costs. If you use ACH (I'm assuming you're in the US, if not, SEPA is for Europe) there will be minimal fees, 0.25-0.75%. Either way, identity verification will be required, since you can do chargebacks (reversals) on debit transactions, but Bitcoin transactions cannot be reversed.
For a beginner, I would recommend Gemini or Uphold. Gemini is pretty basic, and the fee will be 0.5% or less. Uphold is 0.7% or 0.75% IIRC, but it lets you store Bitcoin, Ether (Bitcoin competitor), fiat (USD, GBP, EUR, or lots of others), or commodities (gold, silver, platinum). There is a small fee for exchanging currencies.
I would point you to Uphold, although Gemini is also a great option.
I would also diversify and buy some Ether.
Edit: you could also buy at a local ATM without ID, but the fees will be 5-8%. LocalBitcoins and BitQuick also work, but you'll need to either deposit cash into a bank account, or use Western Union. The fees usually are lower than Bitcoin ATMs, but higher than the exchanges I mentioned. I would say stick with the exchanges.

~~Lead is heavier, and any cheap metal (zinc, tin, aluminum) is lighter. Couldn't you just mix them in the right proportions?~~

You can thank the Fed and quantitative easing for that.

I've had a litecoin transaction "pending" for 3 weeks. It hasn't actually been sent on the network. Coinbase will only respond with automated messages telling me transactions take up to 72 hours.

I used whatever the default was. It never appeared on the litecoin blockchain. Wouldn't it show up, but be unconfirmed.

Uphold is pretty good.
