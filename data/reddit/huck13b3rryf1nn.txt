Welp, I watched the video, read every comment on the video, the FAQ on colorcoins.org and every comment in this thread and i still don't understand what this is.
 seems to say that this would allow anyone to use bitcoins in a way that takes the value of whatever you have and turns it into x amount of uniform coins, with no decimal places
that's how confused i am
@_date: 2014-02-25 02:11:35
i'm wondering... why would people have advised against using coinbase vs localbitcoin?  because i remember that option existing the last time i bought coins.  i'm using coinbase, no worries, but just wondering is it something about security of transaction or how long transactions take?
@_date: 2014-03-04 19:40:26
true.  so far i've done just that!
@_date: 2014-03-04 19:27:45
Yes, I do too.
@_date: 2014-02-25 02:31:15
i just tried.... holy crap it's annoying.  4 day wait period unless you have a visa credit card (NOT a debit card)
@_date: 2014-02-27 03:01:21
I have to say, I wish I would've bought at the 490ish point.  I ended up buying the next day at around 530.  I was confused, I thought it would wait 4 days and then charge you, but then I realized it was charging you for the amount bitcoin was worth -that very moment-.  That's fucking awesome!!!  Finally an easy way to buy bitcoins (now that LocalBitCoins features US-banned payment methods basically....)
@_date: 2014-03-04 19:39:11
man, it's so cool looking at these things and not knowing anything about higher, or even moderate math!
lmao the discussion in that thread just makes me feel 'okay, so cool graphs -- but u never know [because of X reason which only makes sense to those who understand maths/charts/logic]!!!'
@_date: 2014-03-04 19:25:12
yes, i think the next time i run into some extra cash, i may just say fuck it and get the remaining 75%.  i want to have 1 bitcoin for savings and then other (fractions of) bitcoins for actual spending
i really believe bitcoin will be gigantic in the future.  i just hate the fact that i'm not some relatively wealthy bro.  i can't believe there are people with expendable money not buying at least 10 bitcoins.  tried to tell people in my family with money but no one listened to me :(
@_date: 2014-03-04 19:41:33
i might just do that, we'll see

you gotta trust your instincts more man, this guy is obviously legit, not everything has to be proven technically.  you can just use the context, the general vibe of someone's post/writing-style, to determine legitimacy, as well.
@_date: 2014-03-04 19:30:45
honestly the bitcoin price seems more predictable than most people give credit for.  it's not like you can set anything in stone, but mt gox going down made the price lower.  that's pretty standard.  prior to that, internet hype led to it raising -- again, that checks out.  
nothing's really happening right now, except the normal good news, so it's slowly rising.  again, seems normal.
i've only been monitoring since last november and when it dropped to 400 it was obvious that that was when i should buy, so i imagine those who've been watching for ages have a better sense of instinct and perhaps even know where it's going.  obviously no one knows FOR SURE but that's why i labeled this speculative

@_date: 2014-03-04 19:43:16

actually most of the earliest roads were formed from pre-existing animal trails, which were formed, moreorless, on 'hope this is the right way'-animal instinct.  
we did plan-out roads later, but the initial foundational roadwork was just a refining of animal trails that became native american trails that became modern roads
(edit: that's the thing about paths, if they aren't good paths, animals won't take them and erosion does the rest.  so you might think how improbable it is animals would instinctively guess the strategically-fastest routes across the world, but it's actually a cartographic darwinism; of all the bad guesses, there's bound to be a good one, and that's the one animals take.)
@_date: 2014-03-02 05:03:58
wait, what's wrong with Armory?
@_date: 2014-03-04 19:28:13
what other major exchanges are left that would have the same impact as mt gox?  coinbase?
@_date: 2014-03-30 19:53:33
I really hope it drops a bit more.  I'm totally going to buy 75% of a coin if it goes to 350/400
@_date: 2013-12-02 01:50:16
I bought at 750~ (but actual price was about 860/bitcoin).  i saw the price go down to about 840 before rising to 900.  now it's back over 1,000.  every time this goes even the slightest bit below, it's back and stable within 12 hours.  people are waiting to buy-in; waiting for a drop

i only bought like 30 dollars worth.  it was all i could afford.  i bought when it was at like 750, though the sale itself was 860 (lol, local coins).  you think im still considered an early adopter even if i have so little?  it's like 3.5% of a coin
@_date: 2013-11-22 16:54:04
where does a wallet on blockchain.info fall into this?  is coinbase its own wallet?  i was told blockchain is the safest place to create a wallet
so i assume the only other options for buying are local bitcoins?  the other online options, from the tone of your post, i assume are just not worth looking into?  keep in mind i'm not looking for a completist answer here -- i'm a newb overwhelmed... but i'm also a cautious, paranoid noob who is trying to convince my family to put a small amount of money into this, and their concern is 'i dont' want my financial info hacked'
coinbase seems safe, just want to be positively sure that that's the major option.  reading r/Bitcoin gives me many mixed messages and your help / response has been a godsent-beacon in the midst of e-chaos

this is what i've done so far:
created a blockchain account, because i was told it's the most secure
bookmarked a lot of sites giving information, read almost none of them yet (it's very late)
how do i buy $1-$100 worth of bitcoins?

i believe you dude.  it's cool you were so interested in something that you wanted to write about it.  keep it up.  don't stop writing.  it's ridiculous you weren't allowed to write about this -- it really shows the generation divide.  there's always been a generational gap, but what people don't realize is how quickly an entire sect of generation z are catching-up/at the level/beyond everyone else, technologically.  it's so extreme that there's already a divide between gen y and gen z.
this IS normal for you to be interested in, if you're at-all part of the young, geeky male zeitgeist.  that you're attitude is that 3rd graders know how to do this shows just how disconnected your teacher is from what's really going on in the youth.
i'm not a student, but i overheard a bit of conversation between two principals.  it was the typical 'oh this crazy technology'-circlejerk/icebreaker.  about not checking email for days and thinking texting is a bit much, etc.  that's fine, i personally loathe texting, but i still use it.  that they can't even grasp these things, two principals who oversee hundreds of youth, how can they be expected to understand something as relevant as bitcoin?  they can't.  
school in 2013 is  learning how to assimilate while  still gaining a thirst for knowledge / 'learning how to learn'.  rewrite the paper.  this is going to be the first of many episodes of generational divide and you just have to deal with it until you come into power.

anyone who freaks out on you like that is a classic sociopath.  they try to make you feel like you are the one in the wrong (in this case, 'the thief'/scammer'), but it's really just projection of what they intended on doing, blasted at you full-volume in the hopes you'll be too stunned to see their true colors

blockchain is what i want to use as storage, but on blockchain there are options to buy bitcoins.  i'm wondering if i should use those options, or go thorugh what you suggested, coinbase
