- Let's say a bank gets money through selling treasury bonds they have from the US Government. The Fed (or government) pays the bank $10,000 in cash for this. the bank now has $10,000 in extra money, so what do they do with it? They loan it out, of course!
- You go into a bank, called Bank A, and ask for a loan.
- Bank A officer says "okay we can loan you $10,000. at 10% interest for one year" (simplified example).
- Bank A officer writes a check to you for 10,000 from the bank reserves. Bank A officer also types in that the bank now has assets of $10,000 + $1,000 interest (the total amount you owe them) repayment. 
- The bank A *quite literally* has an extra $1,000 on their account as extra money assets that was created as a loan repayment. That $1,000 is now extra money in the economy. 
- You take that $10,000 that you just got from your loan, and deposit it in your other bank which you use for your business account, Bank X. 
- The bank X banker goes to his balance sheet and says "okay, this guy deposited $10k. So on our liabilities, we owe him $10k since it's his money. On our assets, we got 10k in cash that we're holding."
- The reserve ratio rule (federal reserve rule) says that banks must hold some amount of their deposits as reserves and they can loan the rest out. Let's say the reserve ratio is 10%. That means Bank X ONLY has to hold $1,000 of the $10,000 in reserves (think of it as "keeping money in the vault." The bank has to only keep 10% of your money there, and they can loan the rest out.) So Bank X now has $9,000 in **extra reserves.** 
- The bank X now goes to the next customer who walks in and asks for a loan, and says "yeah, we have $9,000 to loan you, at 10% interest for one year." Bank X banker writes the new customer a check for $9,000, and writes on his asset sheet that the bank is owed $9000 + $900 interest.
- The new customer goes to his NEW bank, Bank Z, and deposits his $9000... Bank Z has to keep 10% of that in reserves, and loans the rest out. They do so, writing a check for $8100 to the next customer, and saying that they are owned $8100 repayment + $810 in interest.
- This process repeats indefinitely. Adding all the extra money together, the "total money" in the system (if you add together all the money that all the banks now have on their asset sheets) has increased by an amount that is 1/reserve ratio. so in this case, the government injecting just $10,000 cash into the banking system by buying a treasury bond, winds up creating a TOTAL OF $100,000 of money in the system.
**This is how money is created in the modern economy. This is the summary of Modern Money Mechanics.** Don't believe me? Read the document yourself. Or even just read the first part titled "Deposit expansion," or just *scroll down to page 11.* 
hope that helps.

The Federal Reserve bank of Chicago published another paper that did the same thing in 1992.
Modern Money Mechanics:
Available in full as a PDF here: It's very dense.
Anyone who takes a modern Intermediate level Macroeconomics class in college should have an understanding of this

I get the joke, but you guys act like "running out of money to issue" is therefore a GOOD thing? Because it will happen to bitcoins, I guess, right? No more coins issued after a certain date? 
It's actually one of the reasons I think bitcoin will never, ever be widely adopted. You can't have a long term deflationary currency. It's counter productive.
@_date: 2016-07-10 17:32:54
I completely agree. I strongly believe that cryptocurrency is a powerful tool and can become a pervasive and worldwide accepted medium of exchange. But I do not believe that Bitcoin itself will be that currency, simply because the very nature of fixing the amount of currency seems so counterbeneficial to the last 100 years of economic theory.

Inflation is never, ever good for individual users unless they are debtors. This is why people love bitcoin; they can store the value of their money in bitcoin and that value should always rise. It's like buying gold coins, in a sense. 
But i'm not speaking from a perspective of an individual. I'm wondering about the macroeconomic effects of an economy running on a deflationary currency.
[Many argue that the effects of a deflationary currency are far more pronounced than what people realize.](
Here's the main idea: Money is in fact not a "neutral" item. If prices of EVERYTHING adjusted based on how much money was in the economy, then inflation (or deflation) would never really matter; money would be "neutral." If there is 20% more currency circulatiing then prices should go up by 20%. Likewise if there is 10% less currency (a deflationary mechanic like bitcoin), then prices should drop by 10% across the board. Individuals buying power would always wind up the same, and no one notices a difference.
But the issue is that **prices of certain things; particularly labor, are "sticky." This means that wages generally don't change even when there is a change in the amount of currency circulating.** This has been demonstrated over and over again since the 1930s, wages are sticky, and this has been one of the main theoretical reasons for why "business cycles" (such as expansions or recessions) even exist. 
Over time, if these (well supported) theories are true, this would mean that a deflationary currency would likely cause unemployment due to the nature of how prices and wages would (or wouldn't) adjust. This is a SYSTEMIC problem, and this would be extremely bad for an economy.
the article i linked earlier explains it in a little more detail but i hope that at least gives you a different perspective to think about. 
The fundamental problem is that money (in any form) is not truly "neutral" and prices don't adjust based on deflation or inflation as they should.

This is a massive, main point of argument between bitcoin enthusiasts and detractors.
As someone who is a huge fan of cryptocurrency but also studies economics I can't help but feel like having a deflationary currency is self-defeating in the long run. 
If I had written the bitcoin protocol I would have a method to keep the rate of new coins added to be at an extremely low inflationary level, such as 0.5%-1% per year, to accommodate economic growth. 
But this sub will likely tell you otherwise. Most people here are fans of a deflationary currency because the value of their mined coins should always rise.

This subreddit bashes BFL every fucking day for the exact same fucking thing which that they've been doing forever. And whenever anyone from their company makes any statement, people jump on the bandwagon to be like "SEE WHAT PIECES OF SHIT THEY ARE?"
What exactly did that post say that has everybody up in arms? Jody *is trying to say* "some people say we haven't shipped anything out, but part of the reason the difficulty has risen so much is because we have been shipping more and more products and increasing network hash rate by quite a bit."
She's just awful at PR. 
I don't get why everyone HATES them so much. It's a BURNING HATRED on this sub. *BFL have never guaranteed a delivery date.* They've had a backlog for over a year. They've been consistently reporting that they're trying to clear their backlog. They post shipping updates regularly.
I don't think they have conducted their business in the best possible way, but the way this subreddit acts you'd think they are absolute evil. I just don't see it.

I think the price jumped primarily because a lot of people realized there was the option to earn a very large weekly return with a medium amount of risk and it sparked massive buying. 
What's more of an issue that i'm noticing is that the price of BTC/USD exchange has been dropping over the last month and is getting *hammered* today. 
Speculation? People pulling out? Investors taking profits?

so if i'm interpreting these charts correctly, the estimated mining dividends seem to hold at .015 btc per share, right? And they can sustain that if ASICMINER keeps reinvesting new hardware to keep their mining production relative to the network constant. So that means even at a price of 5 BTC per share, that's 0.003% weekly return or nearly 15% annual return, *just from mining and without sales* and not even factoring in a possible dividend re-investment.
Man I bought some at 2.2 BTC per share and I don't know if I should buy even more now that it's at 5 BTC per share. Gut instinct tells me no no, too much risk, it might be a bubble. Math seems to tell me yes.
@_date: 2013-04-09 16:34:18
As a bitcoin noob, when it hit $100 a few days ago I seriously considered investing $1,000 in a system designed for mining using a bunch of relatively cheap ATI cards. Then I said well how about I just buy $1,000 worth of bitcoin instead? I didn't because I believed the talk that it was "inevitably coming back down, soon, in a big crash."
I am regret. Now there's no way I feel ok buying at this price.

Tipping is huge. Hand someone a dollar for no reason and it will always get their attention.
I frequently would tip people in during last year's playoffs and got some people interested. And the great thing is even if you only have a little bit in your wallet you can break it up into many small amounts.

I haven't been a player in this game for more than a few months, so i guess I didn't really know all this shit.
Well, fair enough.
@_date: 2013-07-03 14:55:42
Wow. I wish I had bought way more a month ago when it was ~2 BTC per share.
damn you captain hindsight!
@_date: 2013-04-09 20:06:53
i'm in the same boat.
@_date: 2013-08-03 21:56:10
What do you mean you're going to have a ROI? Don't you know that has determined that BFL is **absolute pure fucking evil,** their products don't actually exist, and you will never, ever, ever get your hardware?
@_date: 2013-07-25 01:20:17
Well...... FUCK.

A few days after ASICMINER pays out, btct.co pays them out to your account.
You can check if you've been paid by logging in to your btct account, clicking Portfolio and My Dividends to see. They normally take about 1 hour to 24 hours to be credited by btct.co after the ASICMINER announcement. 
I was paid on my TAT.ASICMINER shares on 6/6 and 6/12
