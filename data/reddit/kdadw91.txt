I agree with you that many people are jumping on it for investment opportunities. For me, it enabled me to receive money freelancing in the shitty country I live.

You took the words right out of my mouth.

Yes... but... lighting network, segwit solves like 99% of bitcoin problems. It opens a lot of room for growth. It will most likely kill more than 50% of the alt-coins (which try to solve the same thing), absorbing their trading volume. Add to that NASDAQ futures that was just announced, and bitcoin going more mainstream. I can only see ETH, BTC and some industry specific coins like VeChain to be worth anything by end of 2018. 
Conclusion, 50k$ is very conservative estimate. I won't be surprised if it reaches that price in 4 months.

I was going to sell everything but the emojis changed my mind.

He has a ledger for 1500$? I am well over that amount and still store them in some shitty pc wallet.

I don't get why people love to compare bitcoin to USD and vice versa. It's like comparing apples to oranges. They have different purpose. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:26:41
I invested because I believe in the project.

Any chance you would donate to enriching a struggling college student's  diet to more than rammen?

If I create a company today and give out stocks for free, even a 1$ increase to my stock price will equal to a infinity% increase of the price. So all you need to do is take a the right portion of time and you will have a favorable increase. I am pretty sure 10,000$ could buy you 50% of any major tech company worth trillions today. 
Percentage increase means nothing. The value is what matters.

Don't buy a safe. It is the worst investment. That is what all the burglars are looking for and will find ways to break into or carry with them. Moreover wherever you hide your safe, there is always the chance someone will see it or tell someone else and just makes you a target for robbery. I have 3 family members that all of their safes gotten broken into and that was the only thing the burglars broke into. The joke of all 3 stories is that there was nothing in all safes. 
Safes draw attention. If you have to have a safe the only "safe" option is to build a concrete one hidden very very well. Nobody messes with those.

Only if the whitepaper is 4 pages long and has more random graphs than text.

Yeah exactly where the real value of Bitcoin stands.

The VAT for companies is 10% right? What if I make a company that does bitcoin trading? 
@_date: 2018-02-01 05:15:10
yes ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

That is because real money has to have inflation. That is to promote spending and moving of money within the market. Imagine is 1USD is worth 1.1USD tomorrow, you would wait to buy that nice GPU few days and so on and so forth. Money would stuck up to few people. Inflation at steady rates is good for economy. USD is not store of value. You are comparing apples to oranges.

Only personal experiences. Nothing backed by research.

The point I was making is that you can't compare bitcoin to cash just as you can't compare gold to cash. Sure it has the word cash in the name but it is not cash and it is not meant to buy coffee. Has the same utility and function as gold does. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 06:08:57
It was same shit last year. Only difference we hit a 5k-6k maximum. I am buying a lot once the dust settles

Bitcoin is not a stock you degenerate. I have a big part of my portfolio into crypto but I am glad for this price break. Don't treat bitcoin as your exit strategy or your retirement portfolio. If you believe in the technology buy, otherwise puke yourself to sleep every time there is FUD.
@_date: 2017-10-19 21:05:39
You used dollars which were backed by gold until some point.

Once bitcoin REALLY goes mainstream. That's when we will all make money. 
Just like any currency, it needs widespread adoption. With the scaling they are doing on the btc network I hope we can see more adoption soon.

thanks you are the real MVP. Awesome advice

I mean apart from being decentralized, the current average of 1$-2$ fee is pretty good compared to 3-5 business days for wire transfers and minimum of 15$ processing fees + whatever else the bank wishes to take from it. 
@_date: 2017-10-19 23:12:24
yeah maybe that is what will end up happening but I doubt it can scale. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 06:27:59
I don't know the rules of the "race" you are running. But wouldn't it be more "fun" or fair to contact business directly and make them accept bitcoin or involve them in what you are doing in exchange for free publicity?

Sorry I should have said the space would have doubled. Not the size of the block.

Is gold meant to buy coffee? Even in the old days that gold was used, it was a bitch to measure the weight of, and purity of.

I only do cash I do a little under 4%. Bigger transactions I have done for 2%. But also helps I am in a metro area.
