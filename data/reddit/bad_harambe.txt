“The technology is real”. 
Really broken right now. I understand his sentiment but bitcoin has no reason to be the top coin other than being the first coin. I hope they fix it because I want to ride this bitch to the moon and throw satoshi at strippers while riding in my moon lambo.

@_date: 2017-12-11 18:27:48
Ok so most people I know can afford to risk maybe 1,000 USD.
1000 USD today gets you ~ .06 bitcoin.
Say the average persons moon is pay off their house, and lets say the average house is 300k. 300k/.06= 5 million. I bitcoin will have to equal 5 million dollars for people in the future to hit their moon. And thats for people who invested today who are putting in a pretty good chunk of money. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 16:27:31
This doesn't bode well for the future. We can't have exchanges telling us when we can/can't cash in/out.

@_date: 2017-12-29 13:22:53
It was that spectacular run to 19k in like 5 minutes that made today’s numbers seem low.
But let’s not kid ourselves bitcoin needs work to remain king. Transaction fees and times are way too high. This could just be bitcoin regressing to the mean or future traders cashing out so they can drop the market. Couple that with the fud about Korea add in bcash and coinbase fiasco and you’ve got a meat tornado of FUD.

This is the part that scares me


basically they want to know where its going when it leaves my bank account (coinbase). 
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:35:14
how do you sell when they cap you at 10k?  can i sell all at once but not cash out of coinbase and be ok?
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:20:03
but then we have 2 coins? 
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:57:44
If bitcoin succeeds and Russia China or the us backed it and the other two didn’t....they’d be fucked. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 14:12:26

@_date: 2017-12-22 13:42:31
How do you buy most alt coins? With bitcoin...
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:57:28
I would. They just used insider trading, cashed out of bitcoin causing a massive dip and the sell walls just kept going up and up at lower and lower prices. Then they pumped bcash and released it on their market.
What this did was trigger a mass exodus to bcash. And it all lined up perfectly with the high mempool and Rogers tv interviews. Its no coincidence. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:16:41
Xrp? $5. 
Xrb I think it can hit $90 in 2018
@_date: 2017-12-21 13:03:58
Adding bcash was never the problem. I disagree with bcash but I see why coinbase decided to add them.
The problem is with how they added them. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 12:22:43
This run up probably just prevented a lot of people from selling. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:45:50
Only thing i don't get is why did they pump bch intead of dump it? If i'm an insider trader and i find out bcash is being released in a few days I dump it instantly because i believe that the masses will want out. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:12:18
sorry that was the "low" setting. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:48:51

hard to pump and dump something worth 10,000 while theres only 16 million in circulation. and people are holding onto them for dear life. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 14:25:13
Because when I withdrawal cash from my bank account they don’t know where it goes. When I deposit it they don’t know where it came from.
If I withdrawal 2 bitcoins from coinbase it isn’t the governments job to ask where they went. Or whose wallet they went to. When the money comes back they can ask where I got 30k from and I completely understand that. But when it’s in my wallet they need to mind their own fucking business. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:25:13
yes. they're the same. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:36:08

@_date: 2017-12-15 18:05:44
Can you elaborate on that? 
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:48:41
But isn’t it expensive to open up a channel?
@_date: 2017-12-05 22:51:14
Then why do we bother with sending bitcoins to ourselves and complaining about it?
@_date: 2017-12-15 12:29:55
They use the name and the logo. It’s blatant fraud. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 18:54:43

@_date: 2017-12-04 13:05:57
That’s what my wife’s paychecks are for. Like I said I’ve got enough in bitcoin to pad any crash/dip. If it goes up $1000 in that time though I make money and only have to pull out what I initially put in. If it goes down $1000 well that sucks.
If it goes down 10k it’ll really suck but I will still be able to recover the last paycheck I put into it. 
I don’t think it’s too reckless. Little ballsy though. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:33:26
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:27:56
except the coins (apples) are never at coinbase or your house. They're on the blockchain. A ledger/trezor is more like 2 factor authentication than holding your own bitcoins.

3) Asians have the weakest fucking hands

I thought it would just increase how frequently the coins came out. We'd still have 21 million they'd just be here sooner?
@_date: 2017-12-15 22:45:43
What’s the rumor? 
@_date: 2017-12-13 22:27:24
Just wait for that transaction to finish. Then cash out those sick gains next week. It’s like a forced hodl. But a forced buy and sell. 
Satoshi wanted you to make these gains. He has blessed you.

@_date: 2017-12-19 12:28:27
Heck I even thought about holding my debt in bitcoin. Not like “bank I owe you 3 bitcoin” but CC is 10k. I make $2500 payments a month. Beginning of month I put 2500 in bitcoin netting x amount of bitcoin. End of month pull out x amount of bitcoin. 
Hope it is currently valued higher than when I bought in. Too much of a pussy to do it though. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:12:37
Price only goes up on bitcoin when it’s unrealistic and related to genital mutilation. Bitcoin demands these sacrifices. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 17:41:58
Actually I was not, i figured if I only took out what I initially put in this would be ok?
For instance say bitcoin is an worth $10,000 for this argument. And my paycheck is $1,000.
1 paycheck = .1 bitcoin
Then bitcoin goes to 11,000 at the end of the month.
I cash out $1000 or .09090909 bitcoin.
This way I've gained a little bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 17:33:30
Lightning network isn't going to work. It requires everybody to put a lot of bitcoin into it.
Dave and Doug have a channel set up.
Doug and Amy have a channel set up.
Dave wants to send money to Amy. 1 Bitcoin to be exact.
For that to happen Doug has to have 1 bitcoin in his account and Dave does too. Since Dave is sending he has that 1 bitcoin. But the network requires Doug to send the bitcoin first and if he doesn't have it Dave and Amy are fucked. Because for some reason the network wont allow for Dave to send the bitcoin to doug to send to amy.

people go to buy bitcoin, download coinbase. See 2 other coins that are much more affordable. Put 50% into bitcoin the other 50% into the other two. After 3 months and ETH not moving they sell all of them at $98 a piece and then cry when it jumps to $300 2 weeks later. Then they buy back in and sell 3 months later when it sat at $340 for those months. Then it goes to almost $600. Then they say fuck ETH and put all that money in bitcoin and litecoin because they can't time ETH at all.

Good on you man. I’ve got a mere 30k in cryptos after ~2k in initial investments. If you would have told me last year id have almost 30k in cryptos I’d laugh at you as I thought I’d cash out at 10k. 
It’s all spread out so it doesn’t feel as real. But for cryptos to become life changing it really has to hit close to a million for most people. I don’t know if it’s greed or just looking at money different. But holding until then is the only thing most people can do. That’s house paid for, cars paid for, financial security, kids college, and retirement.

@_date: 2017-12-21 13:27:07
I think bitcoin has hit a peak until it can process more transactions. If they won’t just give us a slightly larger block size Can’t they change the frequency at which blocks are mined? Not asking for much here. 7.5 minutes instead of 10. Anything.

fiction: you're looking for discussion. You just called this piece racist, you weren't looking to discuss it. If you were the first thing out ouf your fingers would not have been "is this racism or what?" you just used the word racism to try and discredit it, just like the DNC has been doing for years now.

Unfortunately these posts will probably become pretty rare soon. Not that I don't think bitcoin will continue to grow, but I think that the people who can do it now were the very early adopters. The people that can do it next were the 2013 adopters. Then the people after that  are the early 2017 adopters. After that bitcoin basically has to hit $1,000,000 or the person had to be pretty well off to begin with.
I don't know anybody whose bought a whole bitcoin for more than 4k. So unfortunately were going to have less and less people finding their moon.

The price going up is a function of that.
But people wont make bitcoin their bank until transaction fees are lower (segwit/lightening) and the price stabilizes. Price wont stabilize until its mass adopted. It wont be mass adopted until price stabilizes and transaction fees are low.
We're in a feedback loop. We need investors to pump the price up while the coin is being used as a commodity and not a currency. While that is going on the system needs to scale, to allow more people to have transactions everyday.

Our childrens, children will thank us for our savagery. Bitcoin is built on testicle and dick eating at this point. Only thing that allows it to grow so fast is people betting that they'd eat their dicks and balls, if it does/doesn't. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 16:38:09
no not at all. I was just saying that horses aren't extinct and are still used daily as a means of transportation. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 17:25:30
yeah the app probably isn't going to update every second. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 12:40:52
With these gains I almost don't need to. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 18:29:40
If 20k is nothing to him and he can afford to make the payments if bitcoin crashes to 0, then I don't see why its such a bad idea. Bitcoin isn't crashing to 0, it might crash to 4k. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:15:14
lol ok dude.
@_date: 2017-11-27 20:56:10
I'm not counting on millionaire by next year. But If i can pay off all my debts in my early 30s (early 2020s) I'd be happy as fuck. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 18:52:43
These charts are awful for my bitcoin habbit.
Edit: we're approaching sell territory...wow.
@_date: 2017-11-28 23:05:03
*ai controlled 
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:04:39
then the noobs will buy back in at a higher amount and learn to hodl, and we'll have more coins. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:07:53
dudes going to die. 
@_date: 2017-09-05 16:20:58
How do you guys avoid the fee hell?
Say i buy $7.15 worth on coinbase daily.
Thats 6.16 worth of bitcoin + .99 in fees.
I just made the purchase that gave me, .0014008 BTC.
7.15 (my effective purchase price) / .0014008 = $5104.23 (effective bitcoin price). We need to go up almost $1000 before i even break even on that transaction.

lol its been 2 months. But i agree it feels like an eternity. 
@_date: 2017-09-08 20:09:08
Will we get segwit with mycelium?
@_date: 2017-09-11 11:25:32
I tried about a year ago. Went with the Galaxy S7. It only lasted a day, everything about the phone was awful. And I wanted to like it, I really did. But I felt like a 90 year old woman who can't figure out why her dvds won't work in her VHS player. 
@_date: 2017-09-01 12:52:47
lol I looked at my 401k portfolio yesterday. Compared it to my bitcoin returns. Cut my 401k contributions in half still putting in 6% though. The other 6% is going into coins though. My ROI on litecoin has outperformed my 401k in the last quarter.
Plus liquidating my bitcoin is so much easier than 401k. Just not sure on how to do it while avoiding taxes yet. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:03:08
So we most closely resemble the 2/10/2011 correction right now. That could change. And it gets a lot worse from there. 
@_date: 2017-09-19 14:18:49


Thats not enough!
@_date: 2017-09-08 22:05:01
I have mycelium for iOS the post yesterday was for android. I don't see a fee option on mine yet. 
@_date: 2017-09-06 21:23:20
Add that to the 0 support staff currently working!
@_date: 2017-10-12 20:37:51
3.785 million not counting fees. I’m looking at my fees in my spreadsheet now and they’ve cost me hundreds. I’d hate to see what they cost somebody whose been in it way longer than me. 
@_date: 2017-09-10 21:34:47
oh crap so i should move to a different wallet then. Damn i really liked that wallet. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 20:09:42
That was my thinking. 
@_date: 2017-10-12 20:20:32
Infinite forks to spread fud. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 20:09:42
That was my thinking. 
@_date: 2017-09-05 17:38:59
Weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly purchases. To reduce fees. 
@_date: 2017-09-01 22:14:27
But they painted the plants green. So people think they're alive. 
@_date: 2017-09-08 22:02:31
Yes. Don't panic sell. Ride it out. I've only been invested in bitcoin for 6 or so months and I've seen this play out so many times already. 
ATH. 
Drops. 
Settles. 
Friday crash. 
@_date: 2017-10-25 19:51:24
But you can specify to spend from 1 chain or the other right?
@_date: 2017-10-13 11:43:37
They took 3 months to respond to my email. 
@_date: 2017-10-25 19:05:30
What happens when one exchange calls 1x, bitcoin classic, 2x bitcoin, and anther exchange calls 1x, Bitcoin, and 2x, 2x? WTF this is going to be a shit show. 
@_date: 2017-09-01 22:22:27
The gains on those weekly buys are still the same. If you put in $20 and got 20 coins, and then the price doubles to $2 a coin. You doubled your money.
If you put in $20 and got 10 coins and the price doubles to $4 a coin. Your doubled your money again. 
@_date: 2017-10-12 20:20:57
Which fork are you reffering to?
@_date: 2017-09-14 16:26:42
Wait is it rolls Royce specifically that's a faraday cage? Or are you saying all cars are faraday cages. 
@_date: 2017-09-01 22:24:11
We're hitting 10k this year. I used to think we could hit 5. 5 is as good as here. I think we can double one more time in the last 4 months. 
@_date: 2017-10-02 17:41:08
If your common person is no longer buying bitcoin the price is going to eventually crash if nobody is demanding it anymore. 
@_date: 2017-10-30 12:53:40
so the government is going to vote on giving itself less money on daily transactions?
I mean if it passes, crypto would fucking sky rocket in america. 
@_date: 2017-10-02 17:10:32
Question, could places like JP Morgan, GS, and the likes buy up so much bitcoin that they become so rare people don't use them anymore and become devalued? Or can they only buy up so many to increase the price and then dump it, hoping to scare people off in crashes?
@_date: 2017-10-25 18:11:37
only because miners get to decide. 
@_date: 2017-10-12 20:39:59
What happens if you delete a wallet with funds in it? Do you just regenerate it?
@_date: 2017-07-18 13:57:08
STOP STALKING ME
@_date: 2017-07-25 21:40:45
So I keep my coins in mycelium. Where will these BCC coins show up?
@_date: 2017-07-06 14:21:53
For bitcoin being decentralized it sure does seem like jihan controls it...maybe we can revolt, maybe bitcoin dies if not. 
@_date: 2017-07-14 13:10:49
STOP STALKING ME
@_date: 2017-06-06 17:05:50


We went from $2800 to the low 2000s, a greater than 20% reduction in 2 weeks. That was our bear trap. Now its time to soar to new heights.
Also this graph is dumb, so don't listen to me. 
@_date: 2017-06-06 20:41:19
Wha do you recommend? I'd just plug it in at work too. My it guy and I are pretty chill. 
@_date: 2017-06-06 19:55:45
I think it depends on what asians think of this. Do they even care about stuff like this? If they don't it doesn't matter what happens. 
@_date: 2017-06-06 13:53:38
So who's going to hodl through the great August 1st crash?
@_date: 2017-06-06 16:48:36
I want to sell, but if it doesn't crash I'm going to be upset. going to have fomo either way. 
@_date: 2017-06-07 12:33:24
I'm still confused though if it breaks inbetween 2 chains and 1 dies, what happens to the coins on the old chain? How do those eventually get moved to the new chain?
@_date: 2017-06-06 16:55:24
So can i buy a shitty mining rig and signal for segwit? I don't care if it makes me money, I just want to help bitcoin, which in turn will make me money. 
@_date: 2017-06-06 18:30:49
you say that like its a good thing. Independence never comes free, people will die and the suicide hotline will be posted. 
@_date: 2017-06-22 12:15:51
Can somebody link the text here. I'd have to turn my adblocker on my phone off.  So fuck Forbes. 
@_date: 2017-06-06 15:20:25
I'd say were good until mid July....If segwit activates before then were ok. If not, I may at least take out my initial investment and wait until it crashes and see what the plan of action is going to be going forward. 
@_date: 2017-06-06 16:50:29
TFW I will never be a bitcoin millionaire :(
