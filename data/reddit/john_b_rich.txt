Trezor is my preferred hardware wallet. 
Nano is decent dont get me wrong but Trezor has never been wonky at all or let me down. 
Nano could only store 4 different cryptos and just isnt as easy to navigate wallet imo.

Its sound money. The tech controls weather individuals hold a currency that is fair to everyone. 
The US government decided to drop the Gold Standard in the 70s when Nixon had problems with his expensive war and the French wanted their gold for the US dollars they held. US didnt have enough gold to meet the demand...ooops. 
That isn't sound money. To back it with gold for decades then "nah we dont need that anymore" value it though! 
Oh and ALL the other currencies being pegged to that non-gold backed currency?!?! How the fuck is that fair to people in other countries ? It's this type of historical bullshit that people want to gloss over that just keeps making fiats days limited even more.

Have Ledger and Trezor with BRD for cold wallet
Both Ledger and Trezor have their fans. UI is a preference to each their own, both are wallets I trust my bitcoin with. 
I prefer Trezor because it feels more secure to me, Ledger only held 4 cryptos total back when I was on a shitcoin bender and 4 cryptos just aint enough for a bender. 
Also, I think there is some dispute about whether Ledgers security protocol should be open source or not, can't recall what the drama was about that back in the day. 
Either is good, my pref is Trezor by a mile.

Blockchain Technology is a talking point for banks that don't want bitcoin disrupting their cash cow
That's the benefit. We have had ledgers for centuries. Blockchain is a digital ledger. 
The benefit of bitcoins blockchain is publicly available proof of monetary policy and transactions being made without requiring 3rd parties. 
All the fees the banks take for moving money and storing money go bye bye when people buy bitcoin. They claim it is fraud but its an open source protocol that anyone can view the code and use with just having access to the internet.

People want safe haven money while China and US duke it out over trade wars and every central bank is scared to increase their lending rates because that could tank their currencies even more than they already are. 
You can [buy bitcoin]( or gold to avoid having the value of your cash holdings in national currencies wiped out while this goes on.
You cant hold the pound during brexit, or the Euro during Italys devaluation bullshit, or AUD (apparently this one is looking bad), or the Argentine Peso, Turkish Lira, Ruble, Rupee... they all just SUCK as currencies during a trade war and record inflation everywhere.

The best developers in anything financially related are in bitcoin. That isn't argued among developers because a centralized database is a whole different set of requirements and standards followed within banking and finance. 
If we were to start money today, we wouldnt take the analog money and move it digitally the way JPMorgan and WF have done with USD (and every other fiat). We would do something closer to what bitcoin is doing, so users can see the money supply and have the monetary policy set in code. 
That is part of the reason the best developers are in bitcoin but the 2nd and 3rd rate developers (still great developers) are on other "crypto" and blockchain projects, not banking security or infrastructure. 
Banking is good for a few years for people who just want to trade hours for dollars but at a certain point people want to create and help with the innovative technologies of tomorrow. Especially within finance, since money creation in the central bankers hands will always end in misery, it's quite interesting to have a disruptive technology that is innovating in finance.

Bitcoin has separated itself from anything in "crypto" that other people care about 
Go care about and altcoin and worry that it affects bitcoin. I hope bitcoin goes down to 5k levels again tbh because I would buy more. 
If someone were holding a stable coin to buy bitcoin after the latest low and HADNT put it back into bitcoin, they are an idiot.

US dollar is $0.04 the value of what it was 75 years ago. The amount of dollars required to buy a car in the 1930's isn't anything close today to back then. The amount of Gold required to buy a car then or today is relatively the same though. 
Gold is a proven store of value. Fiat is not.
$1000 in 1930 is $15,000 today and economists say holders of money are somehow dumb not to  understand that this is just how it works.

I think it is overvalued and just a more natural progression should happen to get to a 5k-6k value at todays money. 
It is not just speculation though for bitcoin. There is a cost of $3-4k to mine a bitcoin that HAS to be put into the valuation we see of this currency. No fiat has that nor is the money supply known to all holders of any currency. 
My hesitancy is that the protocol is constantly attacked and adoption needs to hit the 5% mark (we are at 0.5% by most estimates - 40 million hodlers) world wide before Im CONFIDENT its not going away. Plus, there is still the stupid "better bitcoin" argument from most newbies to the space which is a large hurdle to get over.

Don't start this. It IS money. It just isnt the type of money that is easiest for everyone in the world to use as money right now. 
I can buy and sell things with bitcoin world wide. I can get any currency in the world I want with my bitcoin. Its value is widely fluctuating due to it being the first new asset a person can hold in the last century. 


It is useful as money to millions of people around the world. Just like I dont want Yuan in my wallet, some people wont want Bitcoin in their wallet. There are reasons for both of them having value but I will always value bitcoin more than Yuan.

You need to put the amount you are cool with a 10% fluctuation in and wait 5 years. Then ask if you are offsetting inflation (are you losing or slightly earning money hodling bitcoin) and never expect more than "offsetting inflation"

How do you tax income on bitcoin/alt-coins? For everyone who says bitcoin isn't anon, there are 100 people using it as close to anon as possible. The methods to mask/off-ramp bitcoin into currency will only increase over the next 20 years. 
Consumption of items, ownership of land cannot be hidden easily. Merchants need to pay tax on items sold and track/pay this to governments everywhere. 
Income tax doesn't have to be paid by the rich, look at the US president or any wealthy person with offshore tax structures for that matter. They wont be able to force the poor to pay this without addressing the rich people dodging this in future.

Bad news for Tether and holders of Tether

I got into bitcoin at $900 and never sold during the run... 
I didnt lose anything because Im not in bitcoin for a short term gain or even trying to sell to buy back cheaper. I just bought more at the 3 and 5k levels, I dont give af if we go back down to $1200 because at SOME point the game theory kicks into high gear
Do the teenagers to 40 year olds seem like the types that trust central banks money supply and changes to the rates of interest money is lent, are giving everyone "sound money" ? Have you seen how fucking skeptical kids are today about EVERYTHING... it is only a matter of time that people want to see public record of the money supplies with currencies we hold. 
There is no way that a central bank in any of the 180 countries with fiat will allow an audit of their money supply...think about that.. NOBODY will ever do that. Even gold cant be properly audited. An audit would only show the holders of these currencies how many more dollars have been printed than we are aware of as holders of this money. 
There is so little chance of a "better" sound money coming along to make me want to buy it (with my bitcoin) that I would be really surprised if something ever comes along that looks even close to bitcoin.

Right but in the case of peoples money and identity, giving our data to be secured by banks (and 3rd parties like equifax - they just give our info to) has only resulted in data breaches continually over time. Its a central access point with multiple points of failure through Technological and Sociological hacks. 
Employees make mistakes and steal all the time. Technology needs upgrading constantly because vulnerabilities can't always be predicted. There is a vulnerability within the management of these centralized databases though that the developers might not have final say in upgrading the databases security. 
Whereas the public open source protocol has many bitcoin developers that arent part of the core dev team pointing out potential point of failure and offering assistance to upgrade. 
We wont see a bank PAYING a development team better than what bitcoin has in place for securely storing and transferring data publicly without requiring 3rd parties.

Call it bitcoin? And just sell bitcoin as you travel for the currency you need? It depends what your expectations where but I still like the aspect that their are supposed to be buyers in every country and selling a small amount would get you the local currency.

Dont buy bitcoin if you dont plan to hold it for 5 - 10 years. Its like a savings account for most of us. I use a bit to save fees on wires to Asia, Africa and South America from time to time and sell some when Im traveling and want the local currency. 
Otherwise, just go with a weekly/monthly/yearly amount you are setting away in it and disregard the price. 
Unless another huge bubble spike obviously, most of assume we are staying above the "low spot" for 3-4 years from now when we buy at any amount now.

It hasnt been, nor is it likely to be but lets play your IF scenario out. 
File sharing is banned in a lot of countries and it never stopped piracy anywhere. Bitcoin can be stopped as easily as file sharing on the internet so major countries banning it (when most are taxing its use already) are unlikely.
The countries MOST likely to ban it have the largest problems with their fiat currency. At some point, people will want to hold sound money regardless of laws...

@_date: 2019-06-24 03:25:47


I wouldnt agree with this. Its estimated to have 30 - 40million holders currently, that's more than many countries with national currencies. 


That would be a fork at best, see BSV for why this wont work. You can't change the bitcoin protocol without having the core team do this, they wont just let you make a change to the source code. 


There are "market" manipulation things that may or may not have already happened from hedge funds. I doubt it was a government requesting that bitcoin purchasing at the 8k - 20k range in 2017 but crypto is an unregulated and lawless market. 
Anyone who doesnt believe people were buying bitcoin and buying shorts on the price of bitcoin while selling their position is crazy. I would do it if I had a big enough bankroll and we KNOW there are plenty of groups that would want to play this game in finance. 
Bitcoin will ALWAYS be susceptible to this but there is a bottom where the ones who are willing to hold 20 years are just going to hold onto their bitcoin.

Isn't the plan to force changes in the tax legislation when Americans [buy bitcoin anonymously]( more?

Problem solved.
@_date: 2019-06-10 06:31:24


No, that sounds like how it's going to happen. 
Good write up. Surprised you see it at 750k currently, I see it at about 5k currently due to it only being 10 years old, adoption less than 1% population and the decade coming up that we will have second layers and side chains for payments all increase the value/strength of the protocol and currency. 
It's still kind of like a digital gold (fine by me if we stay with this) with a lot of on-ramps and off-ramps as well as legislation to sort out. If more Fiat currencies go down I could see it getting higher the "todays price" charts (really dont care though). 
Curious if you'd elaborate where you get the 750k number today?

BTC is a store of value, it does that really good and securely without any need to move faster like people previously thought years ago in the space. 
Lightning network and liquid need more competition in the 2nd layer, side chain area over the next decade -- we are only one decade in with this thing. 
I use it sparingly to pay people within the space for online work, I dont want to use it as money on the main chain long term though.
@_date: 2019-06-26 04:17:53
put saving in bitcoin rather than bank account. 
Fiat has not returns, only inflation. Bank accounts have no returns, only fees. Bitcoin can be removed ANYWHERE in the world if you need a different currency.
Your currency has fees to swap for other currencies. 
Bitcoin is digital gold. Do you value that enough to risk fiat you may have sitting around ?
@_date: 2019-06-24 05:42:48
I have been trying to estimate how long before some genius starts loaning money at lower interest rates than banks for peoples bitcoin. 
Some type of shared wallet where they have my access to the loaned amount in bitcoin if the person doesnt pay, just take payment or full loan amount from that. It would be huge because no bitcoiner is letting go easily :)
@_date: 2019-06-10 16:40:36
No, that assumes the average holder of money needs to have enough left over every month to invest AND choose investments that wont decimate their financial holdings. You have these lovely boom/bust cycles in fiat that wipe out even the smartest investors in the WORLD. 
Why should a baker know how to analyze a stock portfolio for maximum returns over a 10/20 year period? The baker just wants to bake and earn a living in society. 
This goes for anyone using and transacting with money. It shouldnt be a "thing" that we just accept fluctuations based on central bankers decisions quarterly. It should STORE ITS VALUE so that the people holding money are not hit with surprises. 
Look at all the high inflation, hyperinflation periods the last 100 years 
At a certain point society has to find a better way to not leave the people holding money with nothing due to these Keynesian econ rules that weren't that great when we had a gold standard even.

Bitcoin is owned by 30 - 40 million people worldwide -- none of them have to follow the altcoin drama
Bitcoin is the first time in history someone can have a bank account with only having access to the internet. That is still a big deal in addition to all the security and protection from the adoption and infrastructure in place with bitcoin. It is its own feedback loop for securely storing and transferring "value" between two parties. 
No reason to exit the "crypto" that funded 5000 altcoin projects. It has 60% of the entire market cap, things like ETH and XRP wont "die" but probably get affected a lot more that bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-06-09 17:03:38
It's estimated 30 - 40 million holders world wide, still less than 1% of the world. 
Close to Argentines Peso (assuming only the population of Argentina held pesos) which is inflating like crazy right now. The fact that people have an alternative currency (that isn't USD) is quite interesting now.
@_date: 2019-06-26 05:24:47
ALWAYS act like its no big deal and you might get rekt, play dumb even.... "oh did it go up, I havent checked it" lol 
I got in under 1k and have only bought since then. There is still a 5-10% chance I get rekt... trust me, Im not rich because Im NOT selling ever. 
Only use bitcoin with bitcoiners and see what happens 10-15 years from now.
@_date: 2019-06-24 00:44:58
You also have the Argentine Peso, Russian Ruble, Turkish Lira, Indian Rupee and South African Rand to look at for "bullshit" stores of value...compared to what bitcoin and gold offer. 
Inflated housing markets in every country. The actual cost of food in western countries due to inflation IS being complained about now a LOT more publicly. 
Then there were the USD, GBP and Eurozone bailouts that just pushed the problem down the road back in 2009.... 
Gold is so hard for people to buy and hold, I still route for it just because this SHOULD be a "sound money" principle we look at when assessing currency value. Not this BS of central banks getting bailout loans and governments patting them on the back.

using a custodial wallet might be different? I use Trezor and Bread wallet with options to set the fee before sending transfers. I assume ledger nano lets users do that too now but I havent used  in awhile. 
You get a "fast" regular or slow transaction option and estimate of how much the fees will be. Honestly havent paid over $1 on bitcoin and make transfers weekly for over a year.

Fiat and Bitcoin are also different beasts. 
The "crypto" thing will make more sense in 10 years but its a marketing term right now that means a lot of stuff.
