If wifi isn't secure it's because you aren't using WPA2. We use it because it's very easy to secure and because it's not as fundamentally important as a currency system.

No, I'd say it's pretty close. I do several hundred-thousand dollars-worth of business with annually and less than 1% has any sort of chargeback issue.

No, because getting rid of it would only allow for even more incompetence. If a lawyer working for you was incompetent you should report him to the bar.

Will the output per dollar be competitive with GPU systems or will the main motivation be lower power usage? What kind of heat would an ASIC system make? How do you define "small miners" in terms of capitol?
@_date: 2011-09-17 18:38:15
But that's a problem. If you break a wifi network it's no big deal. If you break a currency exchange you can crash the entire market and break the currency for everyone.

Not necessarily. Most mining pools don't automatically pay to your client after each block, it credits you online then you withdraw when you want.

The cost of electricity is negligible and you wouldn't generate enough to overcome it, that should give you an idea of how little you would make. Even if you had a modern  CPU it wouldn't be worth it. My i5 quadcore running at 2.8ghz gets 4-5mh/s. My dual gtx 460's get a combined 100mh/s which equates to less than .5btc per day. That means my CPU would generate .1btc per day and your ibook would generate only a fraction of that.

The difficulty increases are actually the most brilliant part of the currency, in my opinion. The only thing I'm not sure about is the per-block bounty getting cut in half. I think that it will be followed by a decent-sized exodus from mining that result in difficulty dropping in half, which means it has no real effect.

This price drop finally convinced me to move some money through dwolla so I can buy.

You're using a CPU, most likely, so yeah, you are doing something all types of wrong.

I did a test sell on bitcoin market. You take the risk of someone dispute the paypal transaction but that didn't happen to me and worked pretty quick and easy. Got 8.399 per coin for a sale of 3.29 BTC yesterday.

Did you notice the lack of absolute terms in comment? Where did you see me say that any advice given by someone not on the bar is bad?
I said that you could, potentially, be getting very incorrect advice. You have better odds of getting correct advice from someone with a JD who passed the bar in your jurisdiction than you do from a random person.

I think that someone has confused Libertarianism with Anarchy if you think this is hypocrisy for a Libertarian to believe. Remember that Libertarians want a smaller government, not a non-existent one. Generally you will find that all Libertarians expect the government to provide a common defense, protect private property, and enforce contracts.
Libertarians do not believe you have a right to steal. Your rights end when they infringe on the rights of another.

It's a very small business that doesn't have any brand power. It's only as valuable as the products that come with it because anyone could start there own very small computer business and get a similar level of income.

Are you willing to pay above market rates for them? Because in 5 days there's no way they'll still be under $8

Law student here, I think this sounds like a terrible idea, ripe for a malpractice suit.

That if Dalin didn't do it then his evil twin did. Everything about mybitcoin from the webhosting to the corporate layout is identical to the other companies he has. He's even had a payment processing company in the past that closed it's doors because "a bank froze their assets."

I'm not sure I'm following you. I said that if a lawyer that worked for you in the past was incompetent you should have reporter him to the bar.

If you waited for bitcoins to drop below $9 to send money to dwolla then you won't be getting it until 8/8. Let's see how the market does in the next 24 hours.

Dwolla arrives on Monday, I hope the crash lasts that long.

Your system would cost more to run in power than it could generate in BTC.
@_date: 2011-08-07 01:12:12
I was simply giving you a fair warning that you shouldn't expect to be able to get bitcoin at the market rate immediately. Your only avenues for immediate purchase would be paypal (which has a 90-day window to reverse a transaction) or cash in person. Both generally will cost you more than market.

Without outside confirmation you'd be vulnerable to double-spending. There's a reason you have to wait for confirmations to consider a transaction confirmed.

Paypal is instant. It's not perfect but you're arguing speed and paypal is quicker.

I was going off of a USD transacted per day number I saw that was a little over 100k. $6k/day is all the more reason they need to step up their security.

Mt. Gox makes about $1000/day in fees, depending on exchange rates, volume, etc. For that I expect pretty decent security because that's enough money for a few salaries.

Lots of people are explaining why someone would want to sell and they've hit the nail on the head but I think you misunderstand markets a little based on your question of "Won't that be the death of the market?"
I assume, based on that question, that you're asking why the market wouldn't break because no one wants to sell their bitcoins that cheap, thus there is nothing to buy. If you're asking this then you misunderstand how markets move.
If no one wants to sell bitcoins for $8 then they will instead list them for the price they do want to sell them for, let's say $10. That's how prices move.
You might then ask what happens if every buyer only wants to pay $8 and every seller only wants to sell for $10. This would, indeed, stop trading activity on the market but this wouldn't happen in a market of bitcoin's size. There are always people looking to enter or exit the game at whatever the market rate is.

The American Bar Association accredits schools and they're actually overly generous about it. There are way more law schools than the country needs.
The bar requirements raise the price of lawyers because they reduce supply as the ones not smart enough to pass the exam can't practice. I don't know who files the most complaints for disbarring, probably judges, though.
It probably took him so long to get disbarred because it wasn't entirely clear that what he was doing was wrong per se.
The alternative to a bar would be having the public make up their own mind about lawyers but they can already do that. No one is forcing people to use a lawyer they don't want.
I'm not sure how you could apply peer-review to bar membership.

The Mt. Gox calls order offering USD for BTC buy orders.

On the PPUSD market at Bitcoin Market it's hovering around $14.

No one person sets the price for the market. The price changes until it reaches an equilibrium between what people want to pay what people want to sell.
If there are a lot more people that want to buy than sell then the prices goes up. The increase in price will likely convince more people that it's worth selling while also convincing some would-be buyers that they aren't worth buying. As the supply and demand fluctuates so does the market.

You have to be a member of the bar to practice law and to become a member you have to undergo a significant background check, get a JD from an accredited school, and take a very difficult test called the bar exam.
Once you're on the bar you can be kicked off for bad conduct which is basically losing your license to practice law. Anyone is allowed to file a complaint against a lawyer for the bar to investigate so in that sense everyone already can help with that.

Without his real world identity you don't even know if he's on the bar which means you could potentially be getting very incorrect advice.

I'm attending an elite (T14) law school and it's only going to cost me $60k in tuition for my degree. If I were willing to go to a T30 I could have gone for free. My family is far from upper-class, my dad is a mailman.
I'm smart, the people in my classes are smart, and yet we're all learning a lot at law school. It's not some formality to being a lawyer, it's something that, if you didn't have it, would make you unable to do your job correctly.
This is more like if there was a restaurant that gave customers food poisoning more often than not.
You may have watched too many TV shows which have given you the idea that a lawyer just walks in front a judge and jury but this is only a very small fraction of what lawyers do. It doesn't take 3 years of school to learn how to be an orator. The vast majority of what a lawyer does is research and the research is much more complicated than just googling something.

Insufficient sample. Lots of trade go down swimmingly. You are exposed to more risk because you directly handle paypal so there is an advantage to Mt Gox but not enough for me to write off a several dollar price difference.

On paypal? The transfer to my account is instant, the withdraw at an ATM is instant, so essentially the amount of time it would take me to drive to an ATM.

A functioning market shouldn't regulate any differently than the bar. If you can't get on the bar (you get multiple chances at the exam) you really are incompetent and the fact that you're on doesn't necessarily make you competent.
There's an incredible amount at stake if you have an incompetent attorney. They can do far more damage than you could hope to recover from them.

No, difficulty is based on computing power. This means that it's possible for difficulty to decrease, which it has on one occasion.

You can't self-tech the socratic method. I'm in school and I'm telling you that there are valuable skills and ways of thought that would be very hard to teach yourself. I haven't heard anyone in class complain they could have taught this to themselves and these are all people in the top 1% of the general population.

To gross 65k/year? I really doubt it. My online company crossed over $200k in sales the first year I started.
