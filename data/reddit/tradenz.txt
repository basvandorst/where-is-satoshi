It's is now that's for sure! Wasn't so bad over the last couple of years

Nice! I keep thinking I'll share some with my family after the next doubling, or maybe the next one lol. A few friends are now buying in each week now too

I think another crypto would be good too. Something to watch and learn about the other blockchain technologies in this space 
@_date: 2017-11-20 10:22:56
Wouldn't hurt hey

Wow! That's some stash right there. I hope you've still got the leftovers 
@_date: 2017-11-16 11:43:28
Ouch! Hope it's just a glitch and you get your balance. It does that for me sometimes but the wallet balance seems to correct itself out

Meanwhile, New Zealand's sitting above 12k after the pull back lol

Is it an email or a notification after you are logged in? 
I say this as there's plenty of bogus email attempts with links to click on

I was a victim also but managed to get my money back. Hope to hear stories of others who also had the same outcome

Thanks, I have a CoinJar account but do you know if the swipe uses the blockchain for transactions or just deducts from your Everyday Bitcoin account? 
I'm under the impression your btc wallet through them isn't an actual wallet if you know what I mean

Great for his followers but he forgot to mention the ability to buy a fraction of bitcoin and instead mentions the price of it multiple times and then ending it with telling them they can still buy the cheaper alt coins etc. I feel this is a big part of showing newcomers that they haven't missed out yet

Some info on the law here in Australia

I own a trezor and even though I'm fine with most electronics I have to admit i didn't even open the box for a few weeks as I wasn't sure how to use it but I knew I needed one. With all the talk about the potential to screw it up and lose your coins it just sat there. Once I read through the website instructions step by step it made sense and now I love it and have recommended my brother get one which he is now awaiting on back order

I think CoinJar does but limited amounts from credit card daily mate

I've had two friends today just message me asking about how to get BTC feeling it was a good time to buy. This is from noobs too so I think it's definitely starting to go mainstream and they already seem to know to buy the dips 
@_date: 2017-10-17 11:17:54
Brilliantly put
