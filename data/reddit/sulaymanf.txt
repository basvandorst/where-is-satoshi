While that is correct, it appears unrelated. The photos appear to have belonged to a darknet trading ring which there's evidence shows was operating for a long time undetected, way before an exploit was noted, and also included android-stamped photos. Apple states that none of the compromised accounts were via that exploit, and the sheer volume of celebrities leaked makes it unlikely that the crackers used that exploit anyway given the short timeframe.

A bank can do business using dollars comfortably, because:
1. The US dollar is not stereotyped, right or wrong, with drugs and corruption
2. Banks are subject to US regulation to prevent money laundering and use for drugs. Are those regulations completely effective? No. They do however make people put their trust in the banking system and avoid bad PR.
You're arguing with the wrong person, you need to convince the public and skittish big corporations/banks that BTC is a real legitimate currency and not the domain of illegal activity. Citibank probably thinks accepting BTC is as big a PR problem as accepting Iranian rials or North Korean won. They won't jump on the bitcoin wagon until they feel confident it will help their image rather than hurt it.

That's not what apple does. Apple has a long history of letting you do whatever you want with your purchases. Did you wanna recompile your OSX kernel? Ok here's the open source code. Did you want to jailbreak? Sure, we'll even host jailbreak devs speaking at our apple retail store (but will patch dangerous security holes in an OS update), etc. 
Apple lets you do what you want, they even encouraged developers to use html5 to create apps since it has no getting process and thus no liability for them. Refusing to host legally ambiguous apps on their own servers is not the same as not giving you freedom.

That was a theory which apple has denied. They said the celebrities were hacked via phishing attempts or successfully resetting the pasword by someone guessing the security questions (it's not hard to find a celebrity's date of birth and street they grew up on, turns out)

While the hack came to light the same week as the photo leak, there's no evidence it was connected. There's a lot of signs pointing to a much longer term attack, given that at least one celebrity has said the photos were from years ago and deleted from her photostream and devices.

False. 
DRM was forced on Apple by the record companies, who wouldn't allow their music in the iTunes Store unless it had strong DRM. Steve Jobs wrangled many concessions out of them, such as allowing users to burn playlists to CD etc. (His biography by Walter Isaacson did a great job covering it as well as the launch of the iTunes Music Store in 2003, which no company before had successfully done.) By 2007, pressure by consumers was mounting on Apple, and Steve Jobs wrote an [open letter]( posted to apple.com where he agreed with the critics and said the problem was the record companies refusing DRM-free tracks in iTMS. After some public shaming by apple, the companies publicly relented to allow DRM-free music, which is the default in iTunes today.

By "incompatible," do you mean why don't they accept payments with it? Many view BTC as a commodity, so for the same reason you can't bring gold to a bank and ask to deposit it as cash. Or do you mean why are they not allowing direct purchase and sale of it? Until recently it had a certain Shady aspect to it (Silk Road) and didn't want to be involved in any potential drug money or money laundering, which would hurt their business and PR.

Hardly. Walmart routinely lowers prices until neighboring stores go out of business, then raise the price. They've been doing this for decades. So have many other businesses and corporations. Uber so far is doing the same, dropping prices to undercut the competition. It's not an unfounded fear they will change later. 
Taxis in NYC are not cartels. At the moment uber is fighting a bizarre battle in NYC against the city, who has actually been pretty good to the company. There are 19,000 yellow taxi medallions and the city is proposing to cap Uber to 2x that amount, for traffic reasons as well as free competition in a crowded market etc. Uber went nuts and has been running attack ads against the mayor, after Uber executives walked away from discussions with the mayor's people. The city has been nothing but nice to Uber, the city was sued 8 times so far by yellow cab companies for defending and accommodating Uber over other established companies. Seeing Uber act childish and refuse to discuss legitimate concerns with the city makes me lose a lot of respect for Uber, especially considering their history of ignoring city regulations.

@_date: 2015-07-22 18:35:37
Problem is Uber, like walmart, destroyed the competition. Why do you think all these yellow cab drivers are protesting in NYC? Because it dropped their business 50% and refuses to play by everyone else's rules (e.g. Uber didn't require insurance for drivers and avoided getting taxi licenses like everyone else had to pay and train for)
@_date: 2015-07-01 17:06:27
No, just no. What better way to harm bitcoin by further associating it with criminal activity? Wasn't The Silk Road and its sequels bad enough PR? It's bad reputation is preventing more mainstream retailers from getting on board.

Uber drivers can actually get in trouble for asking for tips. They're actually supposed to decline a tip if offered. (Tip: insist on it. They will say no once, then accept it the second time. It will also make their night since tipping is so rare)
@_date: 2015-07-22 23:20:21
I'm happy they gave power to the drivers, because over the last decade the garages have been treating cabbies poorly and taking more money out of the cabbies' earnings. The fact that Über disrupted that is a good thing; it's making garages actually try winning people back. It's been good for many in the short-term; more flexibility for cabbies, better deals being offered, and pressure on the industry to make their own yellow cab apps to both hail for cabs and pay. (Already rolled out in NYC and Philadelphia) At the same time, many in the industry are worried about the long-term. Yellow Cabbies are saying their business has plummeted yet again (after the 2008 crisis many firms stopped paying for car service or covering cab fares, which cut incomes for drivers) and are worried that Uber will eventually dominate all taxi services and force even lower wages once they have a monopoly. 
@_date: 2015-07-23 10:26:08
Uber requires insurance and TLC licenses *now*, in 2015, after reaching a deal with the city a while ago. They went without those for a disturbingly long time, and the company's defense was they were a California-based online company and not subject to NYC laws. Lyft claimed the same until the city began impounding unlicensed taxis and temporarily banned the service inside city limits until they complied (and they did quickly). 
@_date: 2015-07-22 19:42:07


Yes they are. There's so many articles published by former drivers who say that it's tough to make ends meet with the service, which dropped prices below yellow cab fares to drive out competition. Uber drivers are required in their contract to speak well of the service when you're in the car with them, but talk to them off-duty and there's a lot of worry. Unlike many yellow cab services, they have to lease the car themselves too.

Nobody I know tips. They won't rate you badly for that, you are mistaken. 
@_date: 2015-07-22 07:59:15
Not happening with Uber. If their rating drops below 4.7 stars they get put on probation, and below ~4.5 they get fired. A complaint as serious as that would instantly get them fired. 
@_date: 2015-07-22 16:43:43
It's nice you think uber is this new and high-tech system, but the fact is the drivers make less than Walmart wages and often less than a yellow cab. People who refuse to shop at Walmart because of how it mistreats its employees are strangely fine with Uber. 
@_date: 2019-04-27 23:23:07

As every low-wage protest has said ever, it is never ever that easy. Do you really think most McDonalds and Walmart employees, or people who pick strawberries in fields, would choose this job voluntarily if given a list of options?
I went to taxi school in NYC. Most of the people doing it had almost nowhere else to go to make a liveable wage. The line to get a cab for the day was always far longer than the amount of cabs available.

Apple is not going to trash the reputation of their App Store in order to accomplish this.

This is silly cynicism and not in line with Apple's past or current actions.
