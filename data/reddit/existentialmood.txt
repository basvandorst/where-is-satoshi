Nothing says "virgin" like "fuckerfuckerfucker".
@_date: 2014-09-13 07:53:41


Would you care to substantiate that? In what was has the dollar "failed"?
@_date: 2014-11-28 17:20:45


Some bitcoiners are rational, and some (too many) are conspiracy-theory nutjobs (or just 14 years old).
@_date: 2014-10-07 00:37:10
This "coordination" may be a figment of your mind.
@_date: 2014-04-24 19:25:55
Substitue "air" (or "underwear") for every time you mention "dollar", and you'll get a story which makes as much sense and reason as the original.

Exactly! They should have dictated simpler equations than the partial differential equations that are the Maxwell Equations! Those damn politicians just make everything harder...

What are the additional ramifications of NC law? For example, are bitcoin profits to be taxed as income?
@_date: 2014-10-02 21:18:06
Do you think that associating the bitcoin subreddit with these juvenile posts will help further your cause?

Does smart money know how to punctuate correctly?
@_date: 2014-09-24 09:52:50


Oh, if you say...

I recommend the book instead.
@_date: 2014-09-30 01:29:15
Gox was easy too.
@_date: 2014-09-15 20:19:22
Actually, my point is about accepting different people's opinions. Your post shows once again, that you're unable to transcend above your personal view. For you, everything is "axioms" (I certainly had no axiom in mind), and, once again, opinions differing from yours are necessarily "confused" and "moronic".
@_date: 2014-10-02 21:19:50
How does that make it a "living thing" exactly?
@_date: 2014-09-13 07:52:55


That may be because countries, empires and other political entities hadn't lasted as long.
@_date: 2014-09-28 05:48:10
Too big to fail!
@_date: 2014-09-15 20:30:54
How is this "belief in your head" any different than some obscure religious belief? Why don't you even try to substantiate it by some rational argument?
@_date: 2014-04-24 19:28:15
Whether or not you raped a small girl yesterday is up to debate.
Like you, I don't see any need for sources or rational arguments.

Calling him a moron for thinking differently than you is not half-assed, but full-assed.
@_date: 2014-11-20 00:54:27


@_date: 2014-10-02 21:14:07
I'm just trying to understand your point of view. Unfortunately, you choose to obfuscate it with your choice of words.
@_date: 2014-08-14 21:07:19
Has XKCD ever made a joke about Muhammad? I think not. This proves(?) that the comic is a Muslim conspiracy.

He did *not* call Bitcoin cheap. He said it provides a cheap way to transfer money.
@_date: 2014-04-24 20:32:42


I'll explain: For some people: Bitcoin == good. Any comment exalting Bitcion == good. Any dissenting opinion == bad. Therefore, Thou shall downvote. It's pretty simple, actually. Of course, this is detrimental to conducting any serious discussion.
I would also like to say that, while I disagree with your post, I have a lot of respect for the way you're handling  this mini-debate with me. Sadly, a lot of reddit users have some maturing to do.
@_date: 2014-04-24 19:34:16
With Bitcoin, who needs Western Union?

How fotunate it is that understands money more deeply than Warren Buffet ever will.

To be fair, the "actual value" of an object can be defined to be whatever price people are willing to pay for it.
@_date: 2014-08-27 05:14:43
Good point: profits/losses.
@_date: 2014-04-24 19:38:48
Lobbyists and corporations have an unfortunate influence on congress. I agree with you about that. Of course, this has nothing to do with your claims regarding the Federal Reserve.
@_date: 2014-07-05 14:41:54
So you're pointing out that using bitcoin would cost me my privacy, and that's supposed to be a *good* thing?
@_date: 2014-10-26 23:46:07
Do you know what "begging the question" actually means?
@_date: 2014-10-07 00:32:48


Really? All it takes is a bunch of sell orders. How sophisticated is that?
@_date: 2014-12-16 23:12:09
Respect for adding "imo".
People often forget the important distinction between facts and opinions.
@_date: 2014-04-23 10:27:38


Well, is a subset of reddit after all...

I'm curious... as a libertarian anarchist, were you happy when the government closed Butterfly Labs?

Do you follow (your subjective interpretation of) supernatural signs as a rule?
If tomorrow you'll see a plate saying something about Jesus, will you go to church?

I spend all of my time watching lotteries on tv. Therefore I have a better chance of predicting tomorrow's winning numbers.
Some logic.

Carlo Pietro Giovanni Guglielmo Tebaldo Ponzi didn't patent his ideas either...

Associating bitcoin with juvenile behavior isn't doing any good.
@_date: 2014-04-24 19:47:26
To expand: I think your claims have nothing to do with the USD either.
@_date: 2014-11-28 17:22:41
The fact you're being downvoted says a lot about this subreddit.
@_date: 2014-10-07 00:35:03


This is circular reasoning.
@_date: 2014-04-23 13:30:24
Thank you so much, fellow "troll". People sometimes (often!) forget the difference between a non-contributing comment, and an opinion they disagree with.
@_date: 2014-04-18 09:31:59
If the alien thing is true? Then it's too late already...

Whether you love it or hate it, it would be so much more productive to focus on the actual issues, instead of this type of shallow propaganda.
@_date: 2014-05-03 16:37:29








So maybe, just maybe, it's a bad idea to get her to use bitcion?

Anyone calling that a joke has poor understanding of what a joke is.

The part where you engage in thesaurus abuse, almost making it seem you're hoping to be quoted in @_date: 2014-06-08 07:48:38


Good point; and it seems nobody's disputing the possibility.

So to you, Dawkins embodies pure logic? Is it not possible to disagree with him over anything and remain a rational being?
@_date: 2014-09-13 07:57:32
How is this off topic? This casts some serious doubts about his judgement.
@_date: 2014-04-23 10:24:07


Perhaps you wish for that statement to be true, but is it really? If Bitcoin were to disappear tomorrow, would the world's social structure be considerably affected?
@_date: 2014-09-22 23:06:10
Cough cough... Is that seriously your consideration? Why is using a credit card less "magical"?

To ensure a profit, you must be a prophet (who knows the future).
@_date: 2014-08-28 00:42:03
Yes - about that.

Hello Satosh... how are the buttery tastes?

So are you saying you foresee the collapse of the US government? This would actually be way bigger than the rise of bitcoin.

Is this a religious cult or what?

Who says wasn't either?

Would you consider professional help?

I wonder what the life expectancy of bitcoin exchanges is...
@_date: 2015-02-13 21:28:28
The point is that marking all answers as 'true' is no better.
@_date: 2015-02-14 07:17:49
Exactly! This cannot be assumed a priori.
@_date: 2015-02-13 21:35:07
I have a tulip to sell to you...
@_date: 2015-02-13 21:31:29
But how can you be sure your position is any more rational? 
@_date: 2015-02-13 21:34:38
Who's to say you're not the troll here, though?
