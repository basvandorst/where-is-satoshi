How high were you when you wrote this?
But seriously, I'm gonna upload my mind o the cloud when we can and HODL forever

You need to have a longer time preference

This is what I did for my family
@_date: 2019-07-25 14:14:24
Thanks, Rabbit

Make it every month and be in this with me
@_date: 2019-07-25 17:05:33
I use Cash App currently. Before that I did $10 after fees
@_date: 2019-07-25 17:07:18
I've been thinking about that. It's hard to stick to $10 a month. I've definitely invested more than just my DCA though
@_date: 2019-07-25 20:34:14
Just a question, if I were to withdraw then it would need to be a lightning wallet, correct?

Thank you, just wanted to post to show that not everyone is investing their life savings, but it still can make a difference in Bitcoin and in our own personal lives, no matter the amount

If you need a good book to read next try
The Sovereign Individual by James Dale Davidson
The Bitcoin Standard by Saifedean Ammous
@_date: 2019-07-01 20:30:08
Or just all Bitcoin
@_date: 2019-07-25 13:37:57
Thank you!
@_date: 2019-07-25 13:13:47
Cared enough to comment ��
@_date: 2019-07-25 14:20:58
Yup, understand completely. This is just my DCA that I've been doing for a while. I've made other investments as well.
This is just my routine and my savings account.
@_date: 2019-07-01 20:31:53
My experience with the website is once you initiate the deposit you can buy bitcoin with that amount and it takes between 3 days and a week for the funds to clear and be able to withdrawal the bitcoin.
I have not tried it on the app, but I assume it works the same

Hodl on
@_date: 2019-07-25 14:14:39
We'll all see together
@_date: 2019-07-25 20:29:55
I have noticed the same over the past year or so. 
Yesterday morning I was thinking about how I need a haircut and thought that I should just do it myself and put the saved money in Bitcoin or in my house
@_date: 2019-07-25 21:11:53
Thank you! You should give it a try
@_date: 2019-07-01 20:38:09
oh my
good luck... looks like you're up over 2k right now
@_date: 2019-07-25 17:46:29
I have a spreadsheet where I put my monthly buy, the amount of Bitcoin it purchased and at what USD price. Then average each of those up
@_date: 2019-07-01 23:58:30
Cash is probably the best but I've had food luck with the Gemini web app. I haven't tried Abra, but good luck finding something new. Sorry about the deal with cash
@_date: 2019-07-25 21:49:58
Well then great for you and good luck as well
@_date: 2019-07-25 20:30:23
Thank you very much!

The Immaculate Inception
The ability to add anything from other crypto's that actually work.
The market share and first adoption
The Lindy Effect
The amount of talent that is working on BTC
and so much more
@_date: 2019-07-25 17:06:36
Outstanding point

Reminds me more of June/July 2017

I didn't even know Macedonia was a country!
@_date: 2019-05-17 15:01:49
Why are you so mad I found something was interesting?
@_date: 2019-05-21 10:52:38
I know, right?
@_date: 2019-05-20 18:18:32
Now I believe you
