They are like a hydra. They are plentiful and populated as ever, if less decentralized than they were during the time of sr and sr2 and agora and evo

if my goal is to spend my bitcoin spoils in hawaii in july, do you figure I should cash out now, or will we be higher in july?

It has always used the USD price, but you pay that value in bitcoin. Im sure the fluctuations are a hurdle but nobody seems to mind

lol it really is, but at the same time this little bit of extra way more than pays for all the drugs I bought back then

how can they even regulate bitcoin? I am a noob but I don't see how the government could even stick their fingers in the pot?

did you guys see those 3 trades in a row with over 40 btc in each?

you would need a team of sociologists and psychologists and statisticians to take ages to come up with such a model.

This money is not needed that is for sure. I like the prospect of leaving it in bitcoin. I am excited to learn more, I have a horse in a race I had no real intention of entering if you know what I'm saying. 
Much appreciated!

If bitcoin is your retirement plan you'd better hope it goes up

No debt, I am 20, live with my parents, I have money saved even. So maybe it will stay in btc for now.

Good luck getting all of a subreddit to do *anything*
@_date: 2018-02-15 20:39:52
Hahaha same here. Doing acid in high school and having spare change in the wallet turned into thousands

I am serious. Does it have an annual cycle like that? that is weird. Would it be better to cash out 0.1 BTC today for a cool 900 CAD or is there a reasonable chance of it being worth more around, say, mid june?
