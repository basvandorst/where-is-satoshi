Hey OP,
Although I'm no UX guy I'm a cloud engineer by day, I work with the same technologies that Netflix use for CDNs and container orchestration. 
Let me know if you need help in those areas. 
(disclaimer: I do not work for Netflix, they're just very transparent and I work with the same cloud technologies for a different industry)

It has nothing to do with beliefs, you should never invest more than you're wiling to lose.
 
Anyone who tells you otherwise has poor financial hygiene and is exposing themselves and their loved ones to possible financial hardship.
edit: OP is literally gambling, if he's asking if he should be worried about prices going up or down then he does not understand the volatility of Bitcoin and with his level of knowledge is in fact having a punt and gambling.
@_date: 2017-12-09 04:11:26
If you have more money in Bitcoin than you can afford to lose then yes, you should only invest what you're comfortable in losing.
Right now you're practically gambling.

I'm in a location where off-peak internet is still a thing and it's between 2am and 9am. 
Is there a way I can set up a full node to run between those off-peak hours so it doesn't affect my regular on-peak bandwidth I need for work but still contributes to the bitcoin

Going on a flat inflation rate of 3% with no increases or decreases $2,520,000 in 2051 would be the same as $922,433 of today's dollars. 
Fun fact: At a 4% inflation rate with no compounding return we can assume that $1 halves to $0.50 in exactly 18 years.
edit: Added Fun fact.

This subreddit just wants to be dramatic and calls everything an attack.

Other alts like Eth and LTC are traded in large volumes on exchanges, if Eth or LTC fell people would lose confidence in Alt Coins, not Bitcoins.
Tether is just an alt coin.

GPU Mining as you can see by your calculations are no longer profitable if you're paying for electricity.
The difficulty is too hard for GPUs to compete - you will need to purchase what is called an ASIC. 
A device that kind of replaced FPGA and GPU miners back in 2013ish era.
ASIC is a dedicated device that is 1000s of times more efficient at completing the calculations required in bitcoin than your CPU and GPU can do. 
If you're extremely keen to get into mining look up BitMain (The main mining hardware group, even though this sub is against Jihan the CEO) or even google "ASIC Miners"

I'm on mobile so I haven't looked up an exact Google link but if you search dead man switch technology in reddit for IT systems you can find it. Some of the homelab and self hosted subreddits have users who have set up a switch that on a date "x" it'll email, wait a day then text, then wait a few days then call them or text another number a couple times and after that happens without verification then it releases emails with passwords, instructions, accounts and letters to loved ones.
I've never set it up incase it fires accidently when I forget about it! But it's there..
Day "X" would be in perpetuity so maybe once every 6 months or 12 months etc.

Am I the only person in this witch hunt who actually donated to bitcoin talk? I've been a bitcoin talk member since 2012 (Different name than this reddit, so you won't find me) I donated roughly 2 bitcoins back in the day when they were sub $10 I dont' remember the amount.
Would I like to still have those bitcoins in hindsight? Yes, you have to remember a massive site one that is almost fundamental to bitcoin has been running on these donations over the 6 years the site as been up.
I don't think it matters at all what he did, people donated the coins on their will. 
Witch hunt for the sake of a witch hunt reddit.

Been in Bitcoin since 2011-2012ish... 
Was a highschool student then so didn't have much (if any) money to buy bitcoin. 
That being said, I joined the community because it was a community. A lot less of a shit show then it is right now between BTG/BCH/BTC.
edit: so you're right, Bitcoin felt a lot more community back then. But we still have time to change that :)

When I was roughly that age, bitcoin was brand new. 
I worked 12 days out of 14 9 hours a day in an electronics store over my summer break. 
Bitcoin were $0.50 cents each (USD), with that 10 days of work I purchased a a new phone and had a few hundred left to put into bitcoin I thought - nah I best just put it in my savings account incase bitcoin drops then I lose all my money. 
Years later when I make the amount I was going to put into bitcoin a day I think shit, I had no long term negatives of losing a few hundred dollars then. 
Each their own, but personally I'd buy in with it.
(i did not read any other comments)

I've used the following three over the years.
Local Bitcoins - if in a city and want to pay by cash. 
Bitcoin.com.au - bit pricey but no sign ups and full transaction done within like 20 minutes
Coinjar - cheapest I've ever used but need to verify with drivers license etc
@_date: 2017-10-29 10:51:59
More of a roller coaster than the price history of IOTA, I dunno how I didn't throw up.
@_date: 2017-10-19 05:37:10
Cash deposits - so Coinjar or Bitcoin.com.au 
Coinjar cash deposits is $1kAUD limit per day of purchases. Unsure on limit for Bitcoin.com.au

There's a bitcoin ATM in Melbourne in the Melbourne Central train station, if anyones been there it's near that asian grocery store under a stairwell (like hidden behind the existing NAB, WestPac and CBA ones) 
I think it's run by bitcoin.com.au ? mayyyybe. But I dunno - someone else who's in Melbourne may be able to check for me.

Bitcoin.com.au I've used on a number of occasions through bank branch deposits (CBA auto tellers) and it's been completed in about 10 minutes - and that 10 minutes is probably the block chain verifying the transaction. 
I've had one case though during wannacry where they called up and said on the phone is this your computer telling you to buy bitcoin, because they didn't wanna fund wannacry so good guys. 
CoinJar I'm not sure but am about to try in 15 minutes so I'll let you know.

It is what it is really. 
Hindsight is 20/20 and I've been very fortunate with the rest of my life, although it would've been nice to have a lot more bitcoin.
I never get upset about not winning the lottery which I don't play, so I can't really get upset about not making it big with bitcoin when I didn't buy at that stage.
@_date: 2015-04-09 05:19:50
OP is right.
I love Bitcoin and still use it but for the average joe it is ridiculous and will never be accepted unless there is big change.
@_date: 2017-10-19 05:39:10
And another exchange can randomly say it'll crash to $5 ASAP.
The thing is if anyone knew what the 'future' was they'd put everything they had into bitcoin or they'd pull all their bitcoin out depending on the outcome.
You need to decide for yourself if you think it will take off.
Everyone on this subreddit will probably agree that it will take off. That's why they're here. 
But don't let social bias fool you, make your own decision on what you think it will do and of course, never invest more than you can lose.
@_date: 2017-10-19 05:39:39
If you have $5,000 in bitcoin yes you can trade it for any currency of your choice. 
Whenever you buy a bitcoin its you purchasing one from someone who has 'cashed out' that amount of bitcoins.

I personally am behind Bitcoin because of the technology, the innovation in applications and services by individuals of the community and to make a few dollars on the side.
I agree with you 100% Bitcoin will not be adopted as a legitimate currency to the masses until it stabilizes. One of the most common things I hear from people when talking about Bitcoin is "How can it be worth $300 one week then $380 the next?" 
Also this subreddit is full of trolls too which you'll soon come to realize so don't use this as your own destination to read up on ~~Buttcoins~~ Bitcoins.

So what you're saying is that you'd prefer for Bitcoin users to adopt bitcoin a hard way which obviously isn't working for average joes just because you did it that way?
The initial purchase should not be cumbersome. It should be easy. Why would someone go "Oh man, that was a total pain in the ass. You know what? I'mma do it again"

My understanding from the conversations that I heard about it as this was during the time Bitcoin prices were sky rocketing was that the idea was for banks to ditch traditional mainframes as ledgers and move to blockchains, linking multiple and eventually all banks together with blockchains.
