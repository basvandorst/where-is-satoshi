Hahahaha oh jesus. Look the only joke I can see is people on this subreddit take bitcoin too seriously. Is that honestly the joke? That your own subreddit is a sensationalist hellhole of bad advice? 
@_date: 2014-04-30 22:09:22
You think I want bitcoin? ROFLMAO Oh jesus you really *are* delusional. 
@_date: 2014-05-01 08:17:46
The joke being? 
@_date: 2014-04-30 20:54:48
Congratulations You have actually managed to out circlejerk every other group of human beings in the entire world.

How many times has the value decreased by half or more in a single day since they were $10? Yeah, don't worry about it. Nobody else can count how many times it has happened either. 
@_date: 2014-04-30 22:47:50
Yes, but.... Lol do you know what the point of a currency is? 
@_date: 2014-04-30 22:20:14
No massa, only the blessed and divinely intelligent genius freekthinkers at understand the massively complex arcane art of "how bitcoin works" lol
@_date: 2014-04-30 23:36:34
I don't know people who make claims should probably support them. You claimed you easily made money off of Bitcoin, if that's the case it should be just as easy to demonstrate. Strange that you're trying to wiggle out of doing something so easy.
@_date: 2014-04-30 23:17:41
Because he is a dogmatic crazy person that thinks bitcoins will be worth over 10,000 each at some point. 
@_date: 2014-04-30 23:05:08
Lol. I love it. You follow a herd and that makes you smart? Let me ask you something: Prove you have made any money whatsoever off of bitcoin. Do it right now. If you do, I'll post a paystub and we can compare. 
@_date: 2014-04-30 21:48:25
Lol. Serious question - what do you think I am bitter about? I don't understand what you could possibly think, and diving into delusion is always fun. 
@_date: 2014-05-01 01:32:34
Lol. Mmmmmkay.

EDIT I also really like how first I was bitter, then I was poor, than I was unemployed, and now I am just boring. You guys are bad at insulting someone. Pick a tactic, stick with it.
@_date: 2014-05-01 01:31:15
That's what I thought coward. 
@_date: 2014-05-01 17:10:16
Which is why I told this subreddit it had successfully out circle jerked everyone, then a bunch of people tried to tell me I didn't get the joke. Do you understand how retarded this subreddit's average subscriber has to be that I got 20+ replies and 50 PMs for *amplifying the joke.* Hahahaha, christ this is hilarious. 
@_date: 2014-05-01 17:13:37
How is playing precisely into the joke having it fly over my head? Explain that. [It seems like MOST people on this subreddit understood that, except your retarded ass and a couple others]( 
@_date: 2014-05-01 19:23:38
You may actually be retarded, guy. 
@_date: 2014-05-01 01:33:14
I have money. And no interest risking it with a bunch of kids and their Ponzi scheme haha.
@_date: 2014-05-01 19:38:13
Well considering you're the only person in the thread I directly called retarded, that isn't the tactic you should use. Look guy, you misunderstood something you read. It's okay. Happens to everyone. What doesn't happen to everyone is this incessant double and tripling down on being incorrect. Do you actually think you have a better understanding of what I said and what I was thinking when I said it than I do?

I was going to make fun of you, but you don't really need help. Just keep on thinking bitcoin is a revolution. It'll totally become true soon. Just you wait. Everyone will be converting their USD into bitcoin to buy stuff and then turn it back into USD to actually use in the real world. It'll be so cool!
