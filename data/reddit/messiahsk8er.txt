"They make more money while Bitcoin stays low"... Sounds logical

I wondered this same thing at one point and I'll tell you the one thing I failed to realize at the time. It's not just 12 words, it's 12 words in a specific order. Imagine a 12 word password for example

You can exchange paypal for Lindens (Second Life money) and then exchange Lindens for bitcoins on Virwox but because of the double exchange you will be charged twice the fees... although it's been awhile since I used them so I can't even compare their fees vs. other places at this point

Sanders and Warren would be amazing but I highly doubt that would happen. I do think it is possible however because in the short term it could disrupt some of the largest players corrupting both politics and Wall Street regardless of any ultimate ideologies
@_date: 2016-04-07 15:22:03
Good point. I think that if there appeared to be a real "threat" from an alt, as in many major bitcoin players recognize it as a "threat", they would be much more inclined to cooperate. 
@_date: 2016-04-21 19:47:26
Down? When was the last time you looked at the charts? Oh, this is in comparison to over 2 years ago where you cherry-picked a spot to advance your agenda without emphasizing the totality of the situation. GTFO!
@_date: 2016-04-28 18:38:18
Well from what I understand you save money when people use bitcoin when compared with using a card so you could offer discounts for that. Not sure how much interest that will draw bu it's something

Fair enough, I just assumed this was a buttcoin comment that was blatantly wrong. I misunderstood, I thought he was saying the price hasn't gone up yet from this news rather than the price will go down.

$4k is a ridiculous assertion following his original statement. There are plenty of fibonnaci numbers between here and there, plus there are plenty above where we're at. He is referring to a technique used in technical analysis or reading charts but none of it is science. He is full of shit

A channel is opened up, multiple transactions are performed off chain, then the channel can be closed at any point and settled on chain. This sounds exactly like bundling transactions to me...
@_date: 2018-01-23 21:53:49
Hardware wallets are pretty user friendly and if you have $1k or more the price tag is easily justifiable, there's always room for improvement but if people can use Paypal there's only one "scary" string of numbers seperating the 2

Ultimately I don't think they're rooting for that, many coins have come and go with each sounding more groundbreaking than the next. Why replace the entire OS though when a simple update is required? It's the overtaking that feels hostile and maybe some push back. A successful alt raises enough concern that it will be co-opted by Bitcoin in some way. As crypto urgencies become more popular the co-opting may become less important but for now this is the natural function and fighting it will only lead to more problems, but hey you know do what feels good

"nick nacks"... well I hope she gets a paddy whack because of that
@_date: 2018-01-28 21:23:12
Alright let's take a stab at actually breaking this down a bit.
Well the outcome will always be in question here I assume. The factors involved though seem to be it is a new asset class outside of mainstream institutions with a very revolutionary oriented user base, it is a speculative asset, and it is an emerging technology that seems to be following the S curve that new successful technologies always go through. So 2 out of 3 indicates to me that it would go up. Rather than being a flee to safety as precious metals do, move from the sea to the land during the storm, it might be just a shift from an overbought market to one with potential, like a see-saw. I'm sure there will volatility both directions and I don't really think it would launch crypto to Mars but I consider my first 2 factors a wash which really just leaves us with the S curve so compared to the rest of the markets it would be business as usual but it would probably be slower than it would be in a healthy community, relatively speaking.
@_date: 2018-01-23 18:49:23
Well it's open source so... yes. As for you knowing how it works... probably not
@_date: 2018-01-29 07:16:23
Yep. Granted certain things are “political” but in this case the answer is verifiable, and therefore stupid to waste time on
@_date: 2018-01-17 21:03:07
I still stand by my statement, even a broken clock is right twice a day. $4k Bitcoin are technically in the cards, but so are $400k Bitcoin in a few years. I mean what are you going to do if this whole bubble crashes spectacularly? Go to the stock market chasing an elusive 20% gain? I think not. The price is just an indicator of value, if a cryptocurrency's price is doing well the important question is why, then you should ask if it is going higher
@_date: 2018-01-23 19:29:39
Well I'm not sure about exchanges in Singpore but link a bank account to Gdax and the trading fee is negligible, then the mining fee for even $500 is currently at 1% max (at $2500 that's 0.2% max currently)... so depending on the fees on the Singpore end this definitely seems like the route to go... minus the "learning curve" of course... I mean this kind of transfer really isn't that complex to me I guess it could be for some people, plus factoring in "how they value their time" and total money being transferred could change the equation even more
@_date: 2018-01-26 18:03:30
I disagree... bear markets are much slower and rational 
@_date: 2018-01-20 21:28:36
I mentioned nothing of it being cheaper than a centralized system, I was referring to destabilizing an oligopoly. LN is that exact infrastructure. People would not need to “tie up” a bunch of money, it’s just money sitting in a wallet or not. I don’t really understand the escrow comment, isn’t that how all cryptos are right now anyway?  is a good point in regards to my idea in particular though
@_date: 2018-01-29 21:45:37
Lol at keeping Bcash. Don't get me wrong I still have some just in case the "civil war" went severely wrong but I would never hold more Bcash than Bitcoin
@_date: 2018-01-30 00:23:38
Gemini is a great alternative
@_date: 2018-01-17 20:47:19
Well obviously. I have a feeling though you will not find any unless you use some fundamental analysis as well as technical analysis, but then again you could always just go play some blackjack and count cards 
@_date: 2018-01-23 21:48:11
Probably the best bet. The most profitable "trade" has seemed to be those who forgot about Bitcoin for a few years to only return millionaires. Not saying there aren't daytraders who made money but they've probably been studying and doing that for years with stocks and shit, my goal recently has been to pay attention but also have enough "faith" in Bitcoin for me to treat it as if I had forgotten about it
@_date: 2018-01-23 18:47:48
The reset your keys remark I believe is just because someone bought a hardware wallet on ebay or somewhere with their 12 recovery words already written down for them, in other words the person had never had a hardware wallet before and didn't realize that the recovery words should be generated after you purchase. My main advise is just to buy one directly from the manufacturers website, Ledger or Trezor seem to be the favorites right now
@_date: 2018-01-24 00:12:31
That moment you realize the technical analysis case for a Bitcoin bull run to $100k+ will have "real world" consequences
@_date: 2018-01-28 21:37:20
It's simple supply and demand. The difference really lies not in inflation/deflation directly but in having the new currency beforehand. If the government acquires enough to have an equal distribution then it will be done just like in your example but if forced to purchase from individuals I don't see them acting in a way that is against their interests, aka supply and demand. That's the main difference, France or the European Union had the money already (in reality they basically had whatever amount they needed due to "inflation" or the ability to create basically any amount)
@_date: 2018-01-28 22:45:44
I mean an Amish farmer was never made to start using the massive machinery to compete with modern farmers, forcing them to use it would only serve to benefit them to greater or lesser extents depending on when that occurred. The difference with new technologies replacing old ones is that the decision is based purely on what works better, in contrast to your politically motivated example in France, in the former the market tends to move quicker than the bureaucracies of the government. There are plenty of examples I could pull from, another would be cars vs. horses but the same dynamic applies, fair is always a balance between altruistic comfort in the present and potential increases of “comfort” in the future

Just no... even if this were real they could be selling them for much more on exchanges. Like really 8 Bitcoins over 2 weeks is nowhere near enough to move the market on any exchange. Either he is just completely out of his mind, has Bitcoin directly tied to something illegal, or most likely by far... in magnitudes I can barely find the words to express, these are scams. If I could say with 100% conviction that anything can ever be truly known it is that these are scams
@_date: 2018-01-28 22:19:53
Well you keep saying fair as if people who have not taken the risks with this revolutionary new technology deserve an equal share of it. "Designs/blueprints" for what is fair are easier drawn on paper than in reality. Even now people have a huge opportunity to get involved with a much more sturdy foundation and plenty of room before it becomes the norm, I actually don't think it's fair for people who don't research this thoroughly or who fundamentally disagree with it to reap the benefits

Why do you think the charts are almost unprecedented, 5 green months goes back to the beginning of 2013 I believe. Plus everyone “thought this bull market wouldn’t start this soon.” This is what an adoption curve in early stages looks like, so in my opinion you haven’t seen nothing yet, outside of the echo chamber here the rest of the world is much more skeptical
@_date: 2019-07-01 21:50:41
I saw someone talking about that over in r/bitcoinmarkets in the daily either today or yesterday but I can't find it now. Just playing around on Tradingview though it looks like the beginning of the massive spike in 2017 actually has 5 green months according to the Bravenewcoin chart, but I'm nor sure which exchanges they use and one month is barely green

@_date: 2017-12-05 21:52:51
I see your point, but on the flip side this helped create the demand early on to get the mining apparatus in place. The hardest part was getting of the ground, thus the exponential curve. Retroactive debate on the exact form of this exponential curve is comparable to an argument over semantics. In other words through the perspective you're looking at it the numbers are arbitrary but before the fact these numbers (from this perspective) would inevitably be arbitrary, so a practical perspective from other angles helped determine this specific number
@_date: 2017-12-02 19:06:47

I'm not sure about the debit card stuff, but if you have a coinbase account then you have a GDAX account. You can transfer funds directly to GDAX or from your Coinbase account, but you have to transfer the funds first which takes a few days rather than locking in a buy at that moment the way you can on Coinbase
@_date: 2017-12-03 19:46:09

@_date: 2017-12-07 21:25:28
I agree. With that being said I think the price attracts a lot of attention and that's not necessarily a bad thing, the next question is obviously "Why?". The part that makes me nervous is people not securing it properly, I can only imagine how much Bitcoin is held on Coinbase right now which only gives them that much leverage in conversations of which their opinion is not always altruistic. Again though, I personally don't worry about this as much as one might assume I should. The genius of Bitcoin is one part technological (maybe 2 parts ;)) and one part psychological, using greed as motivation for something greater

I've heard TAILS is pretty user friendly and comes with Electrum, although getting it to work the first time can be a bit of a hassle.

Circle might be your best bet and they accept debt card as well as linking your bank account, although they do have like a $100 limit for new users and getting verified can take just as long as with Coinbase. With Coinbase you can add USD to your account, which will take a few days just like whne purchasing bitcoin but if you already have USD on your account you can then instantly exchange it for bitcoin. Although I think this might only be the case when using their new exchange rather than the regular, older Coinbase "broker" or whatever that everyone is used to.

Well I'm not 100% on this but I think printing a paper wallet out through coinbase leaves you basically as vulnerable as just leaving them in your account, if not more so. If you have a decently large amount and really want them protected you will probably need to do something offline. In your case the best option might be to look into a Trezor unless you want to do a little research and experimentation with offline paper wallets.

Well shutting down the exchanges is one thing but taking the confiscating the coins and shutting down every miner is a bit harder. It's not impossible but it produces about the same level of fear that the possibility that the US might ban bitcoin produces; aka unlikely

Your "bitcoin miner app" is going to cost more in electricity than you will profit. Even with free electricity I don't see that thing pulling in more than a penny a week, especially without being part of a mining pool. Buy some from an exchange, I would recommend a few but it mainly depends on what country you're in.
@_date: 2015-06-26 04:03:31
Really it will take some more research than just asking this one question to really get any good answers. Let me first say I'm biased... but with that being said you can make money in assuming bitcoin will fail or the price will go down by shorting. Shorting is an investment term and I won't get into all of it but your friend is invested in it and he will probably have incentive to find his side of the argument to see if he is making a good decision. Your family on the other hand have no incentive to do so but if they were very confident in their answer then they could put their money where their mouth is.

The things built on the blockchain, though, may not require such a high value of bitcoin, or these things may not be directly correlated. Many things on top of bitcoin bring legitimacy but not necessarily price, the only things that price is absolutely dependent upon are mining, scarcity, and currency use. There is a minimum for all of this to work but I don't know if calculation of that is even possible.  
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:15:58
Just as the other person said the hardware wallet will be fine. Some precautions you could take is just to double check the wallet public address before you send it (of course). I also sometimes do a test amount and then break the transaction into multiple transactions. More time consuming and a few extra fees but I think segmentation is one of the strongest opsec strategies. This might be completely overkill but just thought I'd entertain the idea for you

Just look at all of last year. I’m not saying it’s a bad thing but with bitcoin price reaches a moment of “critical capacity” where demand goes nuts with little supply available. Eventually it will reach an area of equilibrium in balance with other financial products and assets but we are still pretty near the beginning for that according to the Diffusion of Innovations graph. Prolonged growth piles on more and more bulls until confidence reaches a critical point and price goes crazy, inevitably then leading to the price dropping
@_date: 2018-08-16 22:09:19
I believe that is referring to unknown miners. Probably not connected to a mining pool?
@_date: 2015-06-05 22:01:25
You would have to have bitcoin ready to use in case of said emergency, no one is going to give you free bitcoin and if you don't have access to your money temporarily you will not be able to purchase any. Unless the store accepts bitcoin you are shit out of luck but this would be the case if you went to any other country and tried to use a foreign currency. The difference here though is that more and more major corporations have begun accepting this international currency so there is a good chance that this store will accept it in such a situation at some point soon in the future. 
@_date: 2015-06-02 03:02:10
How do you propose doing this. A lot of people would like this but would you limit mining to a cpu? People will buy more cpus and invent better ones. What about tying one mining device to an identity? Then you rely on a huge third party such as the government to trust that they are not cheating. It comes down to this being the best system. Allowing everyone to mine sounds ideal but actually accomplishing this is much more complicated.
@_date: 2015-06-29 00:42:44
Yeah I would recommend using circle because you can just link your debt card rather than getting your routing number and everything from your bank, although you can only get like $100 worth a week or a day or something

I assume looking for large amounts of bitcoins is the actual driving force here, seeing as he did have tax problems. I don't know if they totally believed that story or not, they probably know better than to jump the gun on any strong acknowledgement or disbelief without proper understanding. They probably just knew that if they made a move fast then the chance of any positive outcomes for them would be worth the gamble, and of course any identification as the real Satoshi or anything like that would just be icing on the cake
@_date: 2015-06-27 19:25:45
Correlation does not equal causation. With that being said this is possible but I think it would be "symbolic" (for lack of a better word) of the fact that people do not like the current major currencies and what inevitably comes along with many of them rather than the typical "escape plan" or whatever for the Greeks that most people attribute to the past rise during the Cyrus crises

(Mooning alert) Today BTC = $250; 20 years BTC = $1,000,000? 1/12 BTC could be worth just under $100,000 of current USD. Many people place a $20 bet on a hand at a casino so in the absolute worst sense this seems like a pretty good bet to me
@_date: 2018-08-16 22:47:51

There's so much noise in bitcoin news outlets that I often end up overlooking a lot of it nowadays, and even when I don't there tends to be a lot of vague promises and vaporware throughout them. I guess at this point you could really include this article as guilty of the same things but it really was a breath of fresh air reading this. It seems to point out some things that seem like common sense but this is only after the fact of reading it. It's nice to have someone who seems to see through a lot of the fog of all this but also has been working on products from this perspective for quite some time

Exactly. My last one the price was fluctuating between under $1k and over $100k. I was looking at the price during one of the super dips and instead of worrying about what was going on, as would be the first logic thing to do in waking life, I was super upset because I could not get my internet to work to buy any, or the exchanges I have accounts with were down, or something like that

I completely agree, it’s hard to express in text but it genuinely saddened me but I basically thought about those things you mentioned at the time as well.

A lot of people are interested in bitcoin because of its potential value which, sucks if you don't have any money, but one of the main reason I am involved is because I think the people who are in control of most of the world's money are taking advantage of that power through many of the same ways that any monopoly or ultimate power of the past has done. It is hard to prove this especially on such a major scale but for many reasons the powers that be might have their hands tied with bitcoin and must adapt as best as they can or completely die. There are many other things that bring great value to bitcoin if you explore a bit but this is one of my central reasons that I am as interested in bitcoin as I am.

 and wanting to come out ahead of the curve compared to other countries if it does take off. There is no money to be made for elites in copyright infringement but with traceable coins from coinbase, etc. there could be potential for clean money to be made, or at least get a large share of taxable US corporations that can become a part of fractional banking for the majority of people

The paradox is having both faith in success and facing the realities of the present. This is sort of where we are at, arguably, with Bitcoin where the future looks so bright but everyday for the past year the price has gone down and everyone around us does not take the time to understand why we are so interested in it

There are ways of buying coins besides coinbase that do not track your name and all you have to do is transfer your coins to another wallet outside coinbase if you do buy them there to have them not linked to you

A hardware wallet is safer. We could get into the specifics of it but the top hardware wallets are not "with a third party" in that you control your private keys and they do not have access to them (just make sure you buy from their website and not a reseller like Amazon). You basically just use the send button on Coinbase and send it to your public address (a string of upper case/lower case letters and numbers) but make sure you double check that they are correct on the device physically for optimal security, I even do a few smaller test amounts to continually checck that everything is working properly.

I don't see why all of those cannot be options. The technology is already there, the thing that I think will bring major adoption is user friendly, mainstream brands for the average person. I hear of all kinds of new technology in the works and paypal is a great example of a mainstream brand. I'm not saying that you shouldn't put your own spin on it  and do what you think is best but I think for the most part technology enthusiasts think this technology speaks for itself better than any cheesy salesman ever could

That,s sort of a tough call. I'm not in your situation so I can only speak logically as an onlooker but I think if it was me I would do just about anything to hold onto that amount of btc, a couple months of torture could pay off very big vs. just being mildly comfortable for what is a very short amount of time in comparison. Again the "mantra" is do not spend more than your willing to lose but to me this is like don't lose your house and family so for the amount that you and me are in for I am very bullish with the percentage of money I have put in as well

I don't really feel like looking for it but I saw a couple of good videos about the whole federal reserve system in the US, especially fractional reserve banking. This could not be directly related to bitcoin but most companies right now have proved that they in fact have all the money they claim to have.
@_date: 2014-11-06 03:47:37
This would naturally happen, to a certain extent, if we could find something to get behind the way dogecoin did with the nascar stuff.

I agree, I'm not technical so I didn't even want to address it at first but to me it does seem very possible. Satoshi dice used the random numbers from the blockchain as its rolls (from what I understand) so I don't think it would be very hard to do the same thing except make the numbers correspond to the 52 playing cards
@_date: 2014-10-31 04:21:27
Its divisability is not the same as how much is created/in existence. Breaking it down into smaller denominations does not equal the creation of more and therefore does not devalue it as would be the case with fiat

@_date: 2014-10-22 06:04:06
Yeah I really have no idea what their criteria for flagging people is but as for the anonymous part most major exchanges are not very anonymous at this point. If you're looking for anonymous btce might be a better option, although I'm not sure if you can get USD in there at all 
@_date: 2014-12-31 05:39:57
For example if you create a new wallet on bread wallet, or basically any one, that new address is not linked to you and is not blacklisted because it is brand new. What could happen is companies/governments/etc. could blacklist any address that is not linked to an actual person, but I guess we'll cross that bridge as it comes.

One thing that could be great for someone in your position may be to start with the Austrian School of Economics. Particularly their emphasis on deflationary currencies and our lack of ability to control the market. For instance regulation might be able to penetrate these institutions better if the world economy depended on keeping them in order instead of bailing them out. The market tends to do things for a reason and in my opinion yes market manipulation could be used for good but this can also be used in ways that do not benefit society as a whole so it is nice to have a theory to fall back on describing how the market will attempt to correct itself no matter how much we pervert it or falsely prop it up.

@_date: 2014-01-28 02:02:21
Any thoughts on incorporating bitcoin directly through the bank itself? 
@_date: 2014-11-10 05:40:12
Okay so basically at this point you would want $100,000 and a hookup on a machine that isn't even on the market yet. Even for a $10,000 machine that is the best on the market right now it would basically take a year to get the amount of bitcoins that you could have just bought directly and by then the mining difficulty would have gone up enough to make that machine next to worthless

There are several similar discussions buzzing around. I'm sure there are many more technical people out there he see the potential I do for a technocracy or a pure democracy on issues that do not need to be addressed on a dime.

I am currently working on my MS in sociology and a professor's assistant to pay for my schooling. For several years I've heard of bitcoin but I never looked into it enough to realize it's potential as a currency outside of silk road until the last bubble when this possibility just clicked in my head and I began to research it. Even before then I had a deep interest in the corruption of macro economic institutions, of which it seems a new scandal breaks out every week, and there are dangers inherent with any sorts of monopolies but it is usually not until much after its demise that this knowledge becomes more public
@_date: 2014-11-30 01:20:26
That's possible but it would be important to use multi sig through different mailing services and an escrow combined with official consumer contact to guarantee a smooth transition for the producer. Or some other things along these lines

I'm not very technical so I don't know if it's even possible but if there was a coin that could not be mined with an asic, I don't know maybe the algorythem changes unpredictably or some shit, it could take a large part of the market but then again we would end up with big money creating farms. They would just not be as efficient and would be much more rediculous

It is basically the biggest one in bitcoin world, anyone who plays will tell you the same thing. I've never had any trouble with it but I am not sure where it is based out of. It looks like the limit goes up to 1,000 BTC and the minimum is like 0.001 BTC I'm pretty sure

There are many ways to earn bitcoins but they are usually know different than how you would earn different types of money, accept payments in bitcoin and buy bitcoin with whatever money you earn. Spending it I guess depends on what you are trying to spend it on, I know I get a lot of stuff off of overstock.com because they accept bitcoin now and expedia is another place I often use because of the same reason
@_date: 2014-11-25 21:58:30
Did you write this?
@_date: 2014-10-26 03:19:35
I'm not the most technical so I could be missing something but that type of coin will either go the way of litecoin and be replaced by new mining algorithm or if it was anywhere near successful people with more money would just buy more computers or something along those lines

I think this is what most people don't realize. I'm not sure about the difficulty and costs associated with going through other avenues to get bitcoin but I think there are many places throughout the world that would benefit both the consumer and the owner, basically until there is full bank implementations or some other simple means of doing this
@_date: 2014-05-15 21:07:03
That's basically the way it already is for more than 99%of its users
@_date: 2014-05-29 04:58:51
Well I for one have never loaded any btc into reddit I think mainly because I have just been too lazy and I have a feeling many others feel the same way. I'm sitting here trying to think of how this could be changed without just saying "hey everyone we should do this" but I can't come up with anything off the top of my head. I think throwing around dimes as a sort of secondary upvote feature would be a lot cooler than just pointless karma and maybe a penny of each one could go to reddit itself or some whit like that so that reddit would be inclined to make such a format simpler. Hey look at that something did come off the top of my head lol
@_date: 2014-11-08 06:26:21
Unless you have $100k to spend and a hookup on miners I would say don't. Last time I checked I think it was like a $10,000 miner takes a year just to break even given current difficulty. Sure the price will go up but it's too much trouble to get the same amount of bitcoin that you could have got by purchasing directly

@_date: 2014-06-03 06:48:21
@_date: 2014-11-21 00:14:33
Most people in bitcoin I think buy back in what they spend, if not a little more. The only people who don't buy back in what they spend are people who were in at least before the last bubble and have lost faith in bitcoin or have just not gotten around to rebuying what they spend. That is why I don't like this argument because at this point I think it is very rare for some when to spend their bitcoin without buying back in or they are in such small quantities that it is not that big of a factor 
@_date: 2014-10-17 02:59:10
I'm not the most technical person out there but is there anyway you could incorporate the same procedures that blockchain.info wallet has where you never have access to our private keys? Or maybe have some sort of partnership with them for this purpose?
@_date: 2014-02-27 01:46:37
Yeah I'm thinking I should get verified on bitstamp as well lol

Tell that to Assange...
@_date: 2014-12-28 19:16:48
Well I don't know the exact laws for every country so you may run into some trouble if Bitcoin is illegal there but for the most part as long as it isn't dirty money from silk road or something I don't see why you would run into any problems.

I think that's called doge
@_date: 2014-12-12 05:57:50
There are certain considerations when it comes to how many verifications you need but I think even major exchanges use between 3-5 confirmations. You would want to check into this though. Bitpay and I think a few others have solutions to accepting with fewer confirmations, for instance if you need to get food out pretty quickly or something, and for the time being they are sort of keeping as a sort of trade secret although I hear that some open source wallet solutions are working on this. As well as side chains...

Circle only requires a debit card and it is probably going to be huge but they just started last month and it has taken them more time to validate my debit card than coinbase.

The transaction may be followed but the new wallet is not linked to you so for all they know you have sent it to someone else. As for the whole coinbase thing I'm almost certain they have just been flagging users who have sent bitcoin to a blacklisted address (known for gambling, drugs, etc.) directly from coinbase.

I've said this several times before and basically for someone to mine for profit at this point you would need $10,000 to blow and a hookup on the latest mining equipment. That combined with the trouble involved and the chance that difficulty skyrockets out of no where really makes it much better to just put the money you were looking to spend on mining equipment directly into bitcoin itself
@_date: 2014-11-06 05:05:22

There are two major conclusions to this scenario, although I'm not sure how much you own which could mean you could sell a little if you had a super shit ton but I doubt that's the case. The two scenarios though are cashing now and getting your wife's vacation or whatever or being short the extra few hundred thousand dollars you could have in ten years. This is the same thing I am facing although slightly different and my mind is made up by the fact that I would be much more upset about missing out on this huge potential than if the missed vacation does not pay off by bitcoin price severely losing value

Well I think I get what you are saying is that directly after the block time halving there will be a temporary slow confirmation time? The mining will balance back out, as I'm sure many people in this thread have said, and for any major players who are worried about confirmation times being a couple of hours they already know of ways to deal with this. I'm not saying this is the ideal situation and hopefully in the future there will be sidechains specifically for short confirmation times but I don't think this will be a major thing regardless.

This is especially true in the US but I cannot speak for other countries.

Whoever originally made this chart was showing a comparison between the last bubble, other bubbles, and potentially the next bubble. This bubble would have burst to higher levels if it were not for Mt. Gox and fears about China but who knows where the bottom would have been. Also who knows if we have actually seen the bottom or whether this is a good time to buy? The creator of this chart seems to think it is a good time to buy, as well as do I, but who knows what news or other curve balls could be thrown our way both positive and negative? I know one thing though and that is that I had heard several people calling 350 as the bottom when it was in the 600s and as soon as that number hit 350 it shot back to around 420 probably within an hour. That to me was a pretty positive indicator of where we are at barring any critical news, which is bound to happen again either one way or another with bitcoin. I am no expert in this stuff by any means though so take what I say with a certain amount of skepticism

This is normally not a very good option because it takes a slight bit more effort and is more expensive but you can use paypal on Virwox. You first have to transfer cash into linden (Second Life (a videogame) money) and then transfer it to bitcoin and paying fees for both transactions... but it is an option.

In an indirect way this security model could be argued as what gives Bitcoin value in that this is a major feature of what bitcoin essentially is. I understand what you are saying which is especially relevant to the fact that "burning power is (not) what gives BTC its value" or that more power automatically correlates with a higher price. My understanding though is that this is one of the features that makes Bitcoin unique to other forms of currency and therefore is a major factor in determining that it is in fact valuable while not deterrmining exactly what that value exactly is
@_date: 2014-11-12 06:03:04

I don't have the deepest knowledge on remaining anonymous but Coinbase is definitely a safe choice outside of worrying about anonymity. Yes you will basically have an address where your coins are stored and you can move them to another address. These receiving adresses are public addresses and you can put them around freely so that others may send you bitcoins or so that you may send more bitcions to that address or wallet, a wallet usually has many addresses and it is recommended that you change them frequently for privacy related concerns. There are also private keys, on the other hand and you will want to make sure you do not release these publicly because that would enable others to steal your bitcoins. Coinbase makes this all pretty user friendly so this may actually be a little more technical than you need, but it's at least good to be somewhat aware.

Yes, it's the same wherever you purchase it from. The best place to purchase really depends upon where you live at this point. I would not really recommend BTC-E overall but there is a chance that this is your best option depending upon your circumstances. I would also recommend Coinbase as well as Circle within the US and possibly Bitstamp as another option for other countries.

Well I think that sort of just comes with the territory. The solution, to the general problem rather than any specific one, would be centralization and thus defeat the purpose of its existence. The only thing I can even think of that would require immediate decisions to be made would be in regards to an attack, the only kind that I am aware of to bitcoin as a whole is a 51% attack and this is just so vastly different than attacks in any other kind of battle that the rules and strategies here are completely unique.

I'm not sure exactly so someone correct me if I'm wrong but I don't think it costs anything to set yourself up to accept it through Bitpay. There is demand, although slight in the scheme of things at this point, to keep people from turning their coins back into USD and the more links in the chain that could facilitate that, given the right environment where it poses little risk of course, the better. Right now you might not see too much of a spike but if you like the idea of bitcoin it will not hurt anything to accept it, minus the time to get set up with Bitpay, and there's the added bonus on saving money from transaction fees if people actually do use it at this point

The difference though is that a lot of people were using the internet and these companies at the time, like a large percentage on any first world nation. Who knows where this bubble is going to stop falling at this point but if the US green lights a decently acceptable legal framework we will be seeing at the absolute minimum one more bubble at some point. This is just speaking about bubbles because it seems the price itself will continue to rise and of course there could be more bubbles. Also the US isn't the only factor in this equation by any means but we are on the verge on some of the first bitlicense guidelines anytime now. The ETF(s) will also be big but when official legal guidelines come in my eyes are sort of looking to see what microsoft has in plan behind closed doors.
TLDR: This is not the bubble you are looking for

I think that's going to be the problem with all wire transfers and paypal has its own set of problems so it is rarely used for bitcoin and I don't know how efficiently you can do it that way for the most part. You can however keep usd on coinbase and bitstamp for sure, not sure about circle or truecoin though. Also I've seen several people mention truecoin and I have personally never used them, just a little personal disclaimer.
@_date: 2015-01-27 04:44:17
The simple answer is the value (or price) will go up, that is the amount of purchasing power of one bitcoin will rise. Now, if say 99% were destroyed or a myriad of similar/related scenarios were to happen? The beauty of it being divisible is that we would simply move the decimal place over if necessary because the value is derived from a fraction of 1 bitcoin being 1/21,000,000 of the total in existence. Therefore, as long as that fraction stays the same and is reflected throughout the system (amount in individual's wallets, mining rewards, etc.?) then it will still retain its scarceness. 1/21,000,000=10/210,000,000=100/2,100,000,000 etc. At this point this would only confuse an outsider and even further down the road I think this idea would only come into play if it seemed absolutely necessary but it does seem to answer any "problems" regarding how unecessary zeros are used when describing a bitcoins value (ex. if 0.0000001 btc= $1 or had similar buying power all of those zeros may become seen as unecessary). I think this is what you're asking?

That's probably a good idea. Never spend more than you're willing to lose is sort of the motto in the bitcoin world. As for buying now you might be right, I might be buying now if had not already bought some at a higher price that I will be holding onto for the for a good little while. I do have a nice little chunk stashed away once the bull market becomes dominant for awhile and it starts looking like another bubble. Another piece off advise is that although you buy low and sell high it is still difficult to catch a falling knife.

I think the end of QE3 will leave the falsely stilted up economy in a position that relies heavily on public confidence which is already in a not so good place, ex. monetary policies between Russia and China that cuts out the US against their will. That being said it could spell another disaster for the US economy which could turn into a rough negative correlation for bitcoin but I don't think we have fully reached that point yet and if anything it will be after the bottom has stopped dropping out that we will see any major movements into bitcoin because of this event

True, and at this point I think they might try to enforce 100% identifiable transactions. Although that was just an example of how people don't acknowledge how big some problems really are. The problems that are solved include a monopoly on the creation of money, transparency in its creation, cheaper tansfer (especially internationally), the first world currency not attached to a nation, general upgraded innovation, etc. As for surveillance issues it seems there are ways to still use bitcoin pretty anonymously and there will be other crypto currencies to follow but I'm not sure how much governments like this aspect or not so we might see bitcoin move completely out of that realm.

Someone on here recently said something that really stuck with me about Bitcoin. First of all yes I have invested interests so don't listen to anything I say, but everything we have ever used for currency just sort of fell into our lap because of its usefulness. Bitcoin on the other hand is a tool created specifically for this purpose. There are many other aspects that are very convenient, especially once "the ball gets rolling", but my previous point alone says a great bit.

These are all good. Liquidity wise Coinbase is the best of these, which is a major problem for Gemini. Coinbase and it's exchange is available in more places than any of these options and is the leader in compliance with all money transmitting laws which really is a good thing because there are other options if this gives you a problem. Initially though I just meant to make the point that Coinbase doesn't have the worst, or even a bad reputation. I don't mean to make the argument that it is the ultimate best option in every scenario either though because all of the options you mentioned are great... although of course not for storage of wealth but that's another story than what I'm addressing here

At the same time though the reason that I and many other people have invested is also because we believe in the technology.

Oops, I guess I meant streaming. Somewhere where users can upload tv shows and movies and get paid a low rate, like $1 split between uploaders and programmers per view.

From my understanding if you become comfortable enough with multi-sig paper wallets or have the time and drive to research them then they are the better option. Hardware wallets seem to be more of a novice's approach, or at least that is the general feeling, possibly because they are slightly less time tested.

If you live in America, Circle would probably be the best option for you. They accept debit and credit cards, some people get through the screening process almost instantly and others have to shoot them an email about it with a photo ID after two weeks but for small amounts from beginners this is probably the way to go. You could also link your bank account with Coinbase which is another huge company in the US which takes like 4 business days so this might actually be faster depending on your luck.
@_date: 2015-01-23 05:08:13
Is that the citadel?
@_date: 2015-01-13 03:38:58
Yes they are a concern. For any substantial investments I would try to figure out the ins and outs of how to make good paper wallets (multi sig...). If it was substantial enough I would even go so far as to contact bitpay, circle, or coinbase (especially if in the US) but this would be minimally upwards of $10,000 and even then a paper wallet would be fine as long as you are confident you know what you are doing. A trezor seems like a good option as well because it allows you to not be hacked but it is sort of new and I am not fully versed in how well it works, although I have heard decently good things. You could also just get a web wallet with two factor authentication which basically means you need a phone as well as a computer and your password to login but between hacking and mismanagement in exchanges I can't really advise this final option in good faith.

@_date: 2015-01-13 03:01:52
Doing it for money is just more trouble than it's worth at this point. Even with a $10,000 miner and free power it is still a bit of a gamble due to the amount of time they actually take to ship, new hardware creation/ difficulty adjustments, price, etc.; given these factors even an a solid machine seems like you very well might only make back your initial investment which minus time and labor (unless you are a computer whiz) just seems unpractical compared to just investing directly.

Well the problem is just like OP said at the end, they could still make one cheap copy and that seems like a big enough "loop hole" as to make the whole idea not worth it. I have no idea how, but I've run into this problem with some ideas I've had with the ultimate solution would be a way to verify something physical easily on the blockchain. Something like an irreplicable molecular "fingerprint" but I'm not versed enough in these areas to even know if that's possible.
@_date: 2016-03-29 19:23:19
Those bitcoins only have value in that you may use them for goods and services. These will also fluctuate, albeit not as radically as bitcoin in its current level of maturity, so that a constant recalculation of one thing to another is necessary on some level anyway. This may seem to complicated for bitcoin to be beneficial in these circumstances but simplicity is not the only factor to take into account when declaring a good or bad unit of account or store of value; for example relative scarcity, decentralized, fees, transaction speed, etc. all factor into both of these at varying levels  
@_date: 2015-01-22 23:09:16
That ending reminds me of the only dream I have had regarding bitcoin price, which happened about 6 months ago. The price shot up to around $1500 in one day but then immediately crashed back to around where it started. I tend to see dreams as guides sometimes and it helped me think about how the market is not ready for higher prices as of yet.
@_date: 2015-01-10 23:14:01
I don't disagree, it sounds like a good idea. I just think that it's going to take some time for people to realize bitcoin is a technology and not some scam company. The internet itself never had to overcome this challenge and is a very unique one, which would also be the same problem encountered with your idea.

Okay so I went ahead and did some research per my other comment. It seems that Ethereum does have about twice as many transactions per day as Bitcoin currently, which is interesting for sure. However, the average Bitcoin transaction is 20x larger in monetary value than the average Ethereum transaction. So take that as you will. Also, I just sort of figured those would be the two most interesting cryptocurrencies to look at in this regard
Edit: Better yet the median transaction for the last 3 months on Ethereum is \~$1-3 while the median for the last 3 months on Bitcoin is \~$200-400

That means that if you only did short term gains for that year (held for less than a year I believe) then 60% of those short-term gains would be treated as long-term gains. For commodities it looks like 15% on long-term and taxed like normal income for short-term which it says is actually more favorable (I’m just not too sure what the numbers of the upper tax brackets would look like)

Occasional reminder about market caps. There is a certain Bitcoin fork, with a reasonably high price (like top 7 or so), that even though the “price” says one thing not one has been sold in 4 months, on the only exchange the deals with it physically! Sometimes it’s hard to see the reality of some coins, but here it is blatant. A “market cap of ~$225,000,000” is in reality $0 when there is absolutely 0 liquidity for 4 months!

I like the metaphor of a hostage negotiation - you try to bring things to a peaceful conclusion, but when dialogue breaks down or fails other measures must be taken
@_date: 2019-08-23 20:45:18
Yeah that's two separate questions. You have to pay taxes on the transaction just like you would if accepting USD or whatever. Holding the Bitcoin over time is considered just like any investment, more specifically like property or land, so selling it at a profit at a later time would also be a taxable event.

And I'm not saying Bitcoin is perfect; but after Occupy Wall Street, blocking the election of Ron Paul by Republicans, and blocking of Bernie Sanders by Democrats Bitcoin may be the ONLY solution to the problem. Not because these other solutions aren't effective and that we shouldn't continue to work on those, but this one is working NOW. Anything else in my mind at this point is just complacency in the name of theoretical differences which usually have utopian undertones

Just from scanning through all of this it sounds like he probably had them stored offline. I know you said something about a micro SD card but I'm feeling like that was just an easy way to explain it. He probably had a regular hardware wallet probably from either Trezor of Ledger, unless he was for some reason just eccentric or works with computers as a profession or been involved with Bitcoin for a long time or like a conspiracy theorist of some kind or something. See if he has any lock boxes at y'all's  bank, check for any safe's he has around the house, or just be on the lookout for small USB drive looking things. He could have had it on a micro SD card for sure but that is just not that common of a practice nowadays.

It acts as if it knows what the full level of market penetration will look like. Look at the Diffusion of Innovations chart, we would be roughly around 5% (give or take) of the entire world population at \~$100k, although the actual full market penetration number could easily be smaller. With all that being said there is a strong case for saying that Bitcoin use has only just begun to experience exponential growth, which is quite the opposite of it slowing down. And just as a side note, up until  this data is so chaotic, being how easily the numbers are moved when they are smaller here, that I don't think those numbers mean nearly as much as most may put emphasis on. They are merely the whims of a small amount of people that (could) have no bearing on the larger trends.

The easiest route would be to look into Coinbase commerce. With that being said btcpayserver is the best option for the Bitcoin ecosystem, and the most recent update of Casa nodes include btcpayserver I believe!

I'd say so; Bitcoin Gold and Bitcoin SV have been no brainers for some honestly, one I'd never heard of the team and was worth a good bit at one point and the other one has a team I don't respect for the most part. Most of the ones you listed I've never heard of to be honest so I probably would even waste my time fooling with most of them but just be smart about it, if you are making less than minimum wage for the amount of time you put in then I would stop thinking about it. There are other ways to control your private keys btw; I'm pretty sure even [blockchain.info]( let's you control your keys but I would do some research first
@_date: 2019-10-08 20:57:01

You will get your money back. Given this scenario one way or another this problem will get resolved. Coinbase is a massive company and would not destroy their reputation over a couple thousand dollars so I believe they will get it back to you or credit it for you regardless of the holdup. Even if they did in fact still your money, which I highly, highly doubt, your bank would eventually get your money for you if you report that it was stolen

Huh... I checked it myself and I'm nor seeing anything. I highly doubt an atm is going to scam you because it's a physical thing that can be traced and sued.

@_date: 2015-08-03 19:07:17
The first devaluing of a scarce resource in this way could open up the door for this to continue. People will jump on board at any point because the bitcoins will be more valuable over time, but increasing the total number of coins just once implies that there is less strength to this value or possibly next to none at all. Although "the masses" may want cheaper coins at some point the reason they want them is because they will become more valuable over time, which will be increasingly less the case if the total number is ever changed
@_date: 2015-08-04 19:34:21

Funny from a fans perspective, but just to be clear to anyone coming here Antonopoulos has not really made nearly as much money as some in this space have (or so he claims anyway).

@_date: 2017-11-10 08:12:25
A good wallet depend on what type of phone you have, or for larger amounts further measures should be taken. As for specific places to use it I️ often donate to places accepting bitcoin which is far easier. Other places I’ve use it fairly often include adding money to my Microsoft account for purchases, overstock.com, and Expedia. There are plenty of other major places that accept it as well but those are the main places I️ use it

It seems like it is a bit of a gamble at this point and I think that is how most places view it.

Honestly, I'd suggest as soon as possible... with that being said absolutely do your research and probably just as importantly just play around with the apps until you understand it, it's rather user friendly but I think looking from a far makes it more complex. I don't think it takes a year to grasp the basic concept of it all and outside of 18 being some abstract bureaucratic number in this case it literally means nothing in a general sense. You're young and you can take risks, never invest more in Bitcoin than you can afford losing, figure out your own responsibility level and realize that it's on you whether you succeed or make mistakes, rather than some institution arbitrarily telling you that you are too immature to make these decision by exactly 1 year 2 months and 3 days
@_date: 2017-11-10 08:05:06
Really any place that accepts it I will use it. I keep $100 or so on my phone and it's much easier to put in a short pin number than typing out a lengthy password on a tiny phone and scanning a qr code rather than putting in all your credit card info. Online this is much safer and easier, whereas in a store it is basically just as easy as cash or a credit card. Again, it comes down to supporting the economic system of my choice and in a small way doing my part to sustain it by participating in it.

The same value drop was proposed with the Bitcoincash fork recently but that never happened. Essentially the Bitcoin market seemed to view the fork as illegitimate in the sense that the market acted as if it was a non-event, the result was "free money created out of thin air" essentially. That conception will get old real quick though, if no one buys the new fork at any price then it is worthless, and this next fork has some particular characteristics that make it a completely different beast. It seems the community and the market are sticking to the original chain so that is where my opinion is but if you're new and haven't been able to form an opinion I would just hold everything until the dust settles 
@_date: 2019-06-04 03:05:21
Yep, but I assume most of those aren't worth shit. However, if you do control your private keys and decide to claim some of your forks at some point make sure to move your Bitcoin to another wallet first so that exposing your private key to some random group does not get your Bitcoin stolen. Most of these forks are not supported by the major hardware wallet manufacturers so you would have to send them to a sketchy website in most cases

@_date: 2017-11-19 03:56:06
I'm fairly certain there are ways of dealing with this, even though they are extreme ones. In theory it seems a lot different than how it would actually play out. In reality it would be obvious if twice as much hashpower instantly came on out of nowhere and we would roll back a few transactions. If that much hashpower was building slowly it would generate more attention so more people would be mining as a result (possibly), and honestly it would not take much for a leak regarding a major entity spending 50 billion dollars on mining equipment to turn the attempted attack on its head at the expense of the attacker while also propping up just how important such a powerful actor thought this attack would be. In other words there is much more risk for the attacker than just not maximizing personal profits or protecting personal profits 
@_date: 2017-11-04 22:44:43
I don’t remember what the hashrate ever was in comparison but I think a lot of miners are just playing their cards close to their chest, hence why they aren’t saying anything one way or the other. I don’t see how replay protection is relevant for miners though? As if that provides incentive for them to mine that?

Couldn't you just as easily split a key in half for safe keeping of a paper wallet (on two pieces of paper) rather than using multi-sig and it would be basically just as secure (taking the amount of time in the universe 500 times over rather than a thousand or whatever)?

Well I'd rather not speak in absolutes. Bitcoin of course has by far the best odds of that in my opinion, followed by a magnitude lower with Ripple, and another magnitude lower with Verge. With that being said let's think about why these coins exist. What is the point of Ripple if you have Libra?
@_date: 2019-12-18 23:18:02
Ripple was always seen as like "a cryptocurrency for banks," kind of like SWIFT is now. The problem with that is that SWIFT is currently working on creating its own new products like this and will not be adopting Ripple, Facebook is working with much larger companies to do this and has several other advantages like its software infrastructure is already in everyone's phone. As soon as Libra was officially announced, whether or not that ever is actually created, that was the death knell for Ripple in my mind. Basically who needs a "semi-decentralized" cryptocurrency from some unknown company rather than say microsoft or amazon

It's like the other guy said, they are looking for stable things for that persons retirement there. It's the same way Warren Buffett looks at it. I'm not saying that bitcoin is going to fail or drop in price tremendously over the next 10 years but normally the investments that pay off the most are ones that carry risk. Like you said, a little research and they might realize the huge potential here but they are more or less looking for something stable with a conservative upward increase over time, like a glorified savings account. In their mind anything else is just gambling

It doesn't show yesterday on many of the transactions charts yet but at different point cryptomarketcap and some other site were showing $11,000,000,000 and $5,000,000,000 or so it transactions. Given the market cap is only $4B I'd say that was pretty significant...

I HODL, spend, and re-buy. Why do I do this? Typically it's easier and safer, plus there's a sense of "if I use this the rest of my money becomes more valuable." For the first time in most all of our lives we have a choice about which economic system we support, it's actually a very capitalistic concept from a nation that greatly values capitalism. So when I have a choice between products, given all things equal..., I choose the better product. In this sense better because I receive rewards for being responsible with my money rather than spending on a bunch of stuff that I don't necessarily need. In a world economy where borrowing has gotten us into more and more trouble this will at least provide a balance to that mentality. Big players borrow too much and socialize the losses, this is a way to bring balance to the equation. Granted this is bad for small to medium businesses, even many big businesses that aren't quite as bad actors, if loans are not as abundant but it will be much worse for the ones taking advantage of this situation. It all reminds me of a hostage negotiation. The first steps are always open communication and negotiation, but when negotiation breaks down other measures must be taken. Bernie Sanders (socialist) says we need laws to stop this corruption, Ron Paul (Libertarian) says let these bad actors fail. Bitcoin invents around this dead end where no one is held responsible for bringing the world to the brink of depression, and no laws are changed

You could purchase second life (popular video game) money from Virwox and exchange that for bitcoin, but with the extra fees and having to be verified on there there are probably better options. If you're in the US you can use your debt card on Circle.

You make this speculation of items losing value seem absolute, there is more than one party at play here and however much better their odds of doing this are there is still a chance that they end up losing money but with even more at stake.

POW is not wasteful, it gives strength and therefore value. "Hacking the network" or a 51% attack on bitcoin is by any standards impossible, other systems like POS are much easier to hack or attack. POS would never have worked if POW had not paved the way, and if somehow POW went away (not going to happen, some group will always be running it) POS would fall faster than you can say piece of shit, lol, jk
@_date: 2016-02-22 17:21:52
I see what you're saying but I think you're just too close to the action. You hear about this stuff day in and day out and it begins to seem much more problematic than it actually is. They're not going to change to PoW or anything that drastic because everyone will end up shifting to litecoin or some shit. Really we're all arguing about a tiny difference in the upper limit of transactions. I know there is real debate to be had if we truly had our backs against the wall that shit would be changed immediately, everyone has just gotten emotional about it all but it doesn't worry me nearly as much. In the end it is in their interest to create a better product and that's what this system was designed to do 
@_date: 2019-04-20 23:18:06
There might be some software wallet that does this but I'm not aware of it. There is a time lock mechanism built into the Bitcoin code itself I believe, I'm pretty sure you could have this done through Trezor, but I'm also pretty sure that doing it this way requires some understanding of coding at this point

Well without these computers competing all you would need to falsify a transaction would be one bad actor with a laptop, metaphorically speaking. With POW you need Millions of dollars and access to cutting edge technology, all without tipping your hat so that others realize someone is trying to manipulate the system. Wasteful if your network is only transacting and couple of thousand dollars, but when billions are on the line everyday I don't think you want people having the ability to hack your system
@_date: 2019-12-05 22:03:17
I don't see making money as a problem. You act as if someone is going to get paid in Bitcoin to then go out and buy fiat. I'm not saying you won't get a "checking account" in fiat for short-term spending, but if your "savings account" or "money market account" has on average returns of 1000% every 4 years I think you will take up that offer. The only reason in your example that people are spending fiat rather than Bitcoin is because it is worth less "intrinsically," if I had an abundance of shit and people would accept shit as payment I would use that.
@_date: 2019-04-24 19:55:35

Well you can always check it on the blockchain, try looking up the public address you sent the coins to on a blockchain explorer like blockchain.info.

I am not really that informed about Qiwi... or the Russian situation with bitcoin in general. I do know that Btc-e is probably the most popular and trusted Russian exchange and just a simple search for Qiwi and bitcoin shows there are some people accepting Qiwi on localbitcoins.com, which is basically user to user. I would check reviews of both users and the website as well as do your own research about them but $60 does not seem like that critical of an amount anyway.

I'd say there is a Bitcoin community, but I think given the nature of Bitcoin it's very purpose driven and less about "being a family" or something like that. I follow a lot of people on Twitter as well as a few choice subreddits. With Bitcoin being an international community I'm not totally sure if there is a mainstream culture to compare with; in this sense though I think there are plenty of differences between it and other "cultures." Incentivizing change would probably be one of the most unique things with Bitcoin.

I'm not you so I can only take a stab at what it is you're experiencing because it would be too easy for you to just say "no that's not how I feel." It seems to me though that the romanticized excitement that was your enthusiasm in the beginning has given way to reality in much the same way a couple goes through a "honeymoon phase" and then is forced to confront the fact that the initial drugged feeling of love will need to be "replaced" with a lasting friendship

You are directing your concerns towards the wrong problem. POS has its own set of complications, thus why bitcoin has not implemented it. If someone wants to break POS it is much easier the POW, although it would be costly. POW, and bitcoin specifically, will remain secure beyond all other forms for the time being.   Otherwise your concern is how energy is created, in which case you’re fighting with the wrong people

How’s your “green chain” investments doing now bud? Quick changes are a sign of centralization in most circumstances which defeats the whole purpose. You think a “protocol war” is going to be big? Please. When is the last time you heard of a currency created outside of a government before Bitcoin? Good luck with your POS, I think it’s a good experiment and will work out fine at least for a good little while. That is until a major government or corporation decides to burn its legitimacy by breaking it time and time again. The point of POS is that who cares if it’s broken if you’re just moving $5. However, if you’re storing several billion I would be a bit more cautious. Good try in trying to build you’re narrative around your shitcoin though, trust me it works for now, just make sure you keep taking a little out so that bubble doesn’t fuck you

The 30k would only be tax eligible on profits. Capital gains wise it sounds like there was not a lot of fluctuation in the time you held the asset so you probably owe next to $0 on that; not that that's an exact amount that you technically owe but I'm just trying to calm your nerves about the "30k." As for how you tax the extra 10-12% I'm not as familiar with that but I would assume it's the same as regular capital gains. It's not like a super rare thing though because if you go to any pawn shop in the world and buy some gold or silver or something they will upcharge you. Overall only your profit is taxable probably... have fun calculating it though lol. It sounds like worst case scenario you're liable for less than \~$5k and considering you're only 20 I assume you don't make a lot of money, so it looks like 12% if you make under $37.5k so probably under $500. Nothing to sweat about like it sounds like you were

So are you critiquing Hodling? As a mechanism or is this specific to Bitcoin? Or cryptocurencies? No matter how you look at it you simply get off on others pain, or do not understand the purpose of Bitcoin or holding an asset amongst all of the speculation. This is why almost no one will respect your message here, you add no value to the conversation and are simply a sociopath. For these reason I am actually happy for your luck, I sold more than I wanted on the way up at around \~$6500 because of Bitmain shananigans and barely evened out that mistake.

"A cahin claiming to replace bitcoin now," "could also happen to Bitcoin,"... uh... lol, where were you a year ago... you are describing that exact scenario. Pretty much everyone is aware of all of this information you are putting out there, the difference is that most everyone else sees the contradiction in the BCH war compared to their original stances in the BTC... and furthermore as for "it being shuffled under the rug" this is literally like you being afraid for the Union in the US Civil War because there are 2 factions of the losing Confederate army who are warring with each other...

Well you're stating a very broad question, Bitcoin "handled" the traffic load then, it just had ridiculous fees. A better question might be with a similar traffic load on the current network now (batching/current segwit usage/projected segwit usage(?)) what would the fees look like. Lightning would only be able to do so much at this point, only due to it being premature for many companies (software wallets, hardware wallet, exchanges, etc.) to enable it on their platform

It is... it's sad to say but given the information you have here it sounds like someone who was close to you... someone who had access to your wallet while you were asleep or something.

"Was the goal of the BCH fork ever to invalidate and replace the BTC chain?" 
Yes, yes it was. 
"if BCH SV became the longest recognized BTC chain, then a year of transactions on the existing BTC ledger would become worthless"
I think you're implying that BTC miners will switch over or something? Anyway that not happening and that's not completely how that works.
"I seriously don't understand what you think is paying for the hash in the BCH war, if you're really trying to claim, "the boy who cried wolf." Unless you think they're paying for the hash in fiat, lol."
Up to this point yes I do believe a decent amount of that was funded by selling Bitcoin but I don't believe them in saying they will continue to crash the entire market by selling all of their Bitcoin for some altcoin.
"You've now made this more about BCH than I have, so thanks for that, especially after making that point in your first comment."
You're welcome. My "lol" made it clear it was a joke. I do see the potential relevance and the agenda being pushed but I just don't think it is as substantial as you, or they, claim

The market was/is saturated with ICOs looking for money but ultimately I would say on a macro level Bitcoin tackles the Trifflin Dilemma where the short term objecctives of a country with a world reserve currency interferes with long term international objectives. I'm sociologist so my discipline is ripe with protesting or having a conversation powerful enough to change things, what is so interesting about Bitcoin/hackers/Cypherpunks is that they simply create and if people agree that it makes the world better they participate, almost eliminating the need for bureaucratic approval.
There are many other problems bitcoin tackles such as the explosion of quantitative easing the US has seen the last 10 years... but I don't have time to get into all of the specifics... it is an economic revolution on many ffronts for sure though as you dig into it more

The real problem in my mind is that every now and then you have to re-enter the seed words and it requires 2FA, great security features but for my $50 I don't feel like going through all that bullshit, it should be optional. Breadwallet has a simple pin number to unlock it and for someone just getting their feet wet it is a much better experience, as long as the mempool is not completely fucked

Fractional reserve means you lend out other people's money so that at any one time a typical bank only has ~20 of your money if everyone decided to withdraw at the same time. If a large population leaves their Bitcoin on exchanges then that exchange could do the same thing in theory, although it would be tough at this point in my opinion because of the culture surrounding Bitcoin. For ex. 3 people buy $50 worth of Bitcoin and all see it "credited" to their account on the exchange, if it becomes a common practice to just leave that money on the exchange then that exchange might become comfortable in technically only having say $50 of that $150 they "claim" to have because not everyone will withdraw all at once. I'm not saying this is 100% guaranteed to happen, I'm just showing the possibility

Coming from a completely different background it's interesting seeing this over and over again. I'm starting to think the combination of early investors being libertarian often, cutting edge innovation, and unrestrained finance is a breeding ground for inflating egos. In an environment that is entrenched in the ideas of liberty and freedom it seems an informal bureaucracy (like that of the internal "rewards/honor systme" for Bitcoin developers) is the only place to find the stability needed for widespread financial acceptance with the flexibility to still have a wide range of people involved

Probably a market cap of $150 Trillion, because of accounting for lost coins.

It kind of depends on what type of device you're using it on. It looks like you're not using a phone so Electrum is a really good desktop wallet, or if you're looking for one that's accessible from other computers [blockchain.info]( has a pretty good online wallet (even though it has come under fire in the past, nothing really bad ever came from in though, just suspicion)

If you look at the chart on crypto market cap dominance a rather large percentage of these random alts make up I believe \~10-25%. Many of these were green lit without even a working system, do not address a situation where blockchain is even needed, or are just outright scams; especially according to people making these claims. Basically this is saying that the market was behaving very irrationally last year and just gambling on claims rather than investing in products with very real futures, in addition they are betting on some of these gamblers still invested so much so that when things go south they will not have the resolve to stand their ground. So basically they're claiming the ratio between those invested in Bitcoin (and maybe even Ethereum plus a couple of others) is still out of "balance"; but one does have to wonder if the potential upside from the last "alt season" is enough to keep them around despite that creating a somewhat irrational market

I don't know what answer you're really looking for here but "is it going to go above 16k again anytime soon" is not a yes or no question. The best you will have is probabilities but that only accounts for known information, whereas the major moves of this market tend to be dominated by unknown information, and by asking for the precise timing of these unknown events you are adding an extra degree of unknown into the equation. So the short answer would be possibly but given you're circumstances I would not bet on it, no pun intended

No, you would only need the dat file as backup, which I know sounds weird under your circumstances.

Honestly though there is at least as much reason to think that it will at this point, if not slightly more of a reason to think so. The time between when that will happen and now is filled with many moments of doubt as well as confidence but if left between a pattern and chaos, I slightly lean towards that pattern until I have solid reasoning not to. Then again "2 points of data hardly make a pattern," in this case 3-10 but I still think the 3 should raise some reason no matter how bullish I am long-term

The "36 character bitcoin wallet" doesn't sounds like a private key.

But there is much more than 32 characters there, plus the specific format that the dashes are in I’ve only seen native to Blockchain.info (although there could be others I’m just not aware of. With that being said if you did indeed login there then I’m 100% sure that is the correct wallet. There should be at least one public address which is what people use to send funds there (as opposed to the private key which you should never share because this enables you to send the funds), if you copy and paste that along with any other public addresses you might have missed then I can double check it to see if any funds have been received or sent

Hey you asked... or maybe you misinterpreted what I'm saying. It doesn't matter if someone buys it and gives it to someone else because the person who bought it is not the person selling it, therefore the person who bought it will not ever owe taxes on it
@_date: 2017-09-28 23:32:37
If somebody "gave" a bunch of money to the Bitcoin ecosystem it only creates a higher price, more hype, and people believing in the technology more. This is no situation where these early adopters would sell as implied by your statement "giving 20%+ of it to one random unknown guy, another 50%+ of it to some geeky early adopters"
@_date: 2017-09-12 06:19:48
If you're moving/storing a billion dollars on a blockchain, obviously hypothetical at this point, you need the most secure chain. Not only from the perspective of who maintains the code/what companies accept coins/sell coins/help protect coins/etc. but also which chain will be better to fight off a 51% attack. Hence in theory there is an infinite number of crypto currencies but a secure one is scarce

Well you only owe taxes on profits. So while yes at some point they should probably be aware that they will owe taxes I don't think it is anything to worry about up front, I mean for all they know the price will go down anyway. I don't think "good luck" is showing that your understand the taxes involved though, that will only be like 15% of their PROFITS, plus they have a $0 cost basis, so they're still gaining money and even keeping almost all of it relatively speaking

@_date: 2017-09-14 21:52:09
Honestly though there is at least as much reason to think that it will at this point, if not slightly more of a reason to think so. The time between when that will happen and now is filled with many moments of doubt as well as confidence but if left between a pattern and chaos, I slightly lean towards that pattern until I have solid reasoning not to. Then again "2 points of data hardly make a pattern," in this case 3-10 but I still think the 3 should raise some reason no matter how bullish I am long-term 
@_date: 2017-09-28 22:54:08
Alright, let's just breathe buddy. Again, I'm not saying you're wrong, there are plenty of examples where you are right historically. HTTP is a good example of what I'm trying to say though, all the web pages from these previous protocols simple switched over to the newer version. In Bitcoin it is called a hardfork. This is how a software upgrade works, unless you charge for the upgrades but that's a different matter because that is not compulsory.

I'm not going to deny the potential of a present or future bubble but it does seem strange to assume lots of people getting involved would cause it to burst. Maybe once the all get in and they're not used to massive corrections but you seem to be implying that it will burst as they get into it, which makes no sense
@_date: 2017-09-12 08:40:44
Well I'm really not an expert but basically you would have to control 51% of the networks hashing power and you could perform a double spend. The hardware required alone for Bitcoin would be tremendous, not to mention the skill level and even the rare (for lack of a better word) occurrence of creating an above market specially designed chip. However, for my examplecoin (tm) a simple graphics card would be more powerful than my single pc
@_date: 2018-03-27 00:01:02
Under your circumstances getting set up with Coinbase (Gemini if they have such a service), etc. would be your best option. If you wanted to create a more customized version of the experience using your own hardware you could do this pending approval of your company but then you or whoever else would of course be responsible for it for the whole company, so if you wanted to go that route I would recommend setting it all up during a period where there is not a donor waiting on you
@_date: 2017-09-29 02:18:17

I don't think "Coinbase stole" your coins, it seems you may have been hacked and that is why they are taking these security precautions. I'm not saying it is impossible that they in fact stole them, I'm just pointing out that you have not provided enough evidence to justify your claims vs. someone else stealing them. Potentially their credibility is on the line in what is at least a very profitable position in a very profitable environment so I find it hard to believe they would throw that away over a few thousand dollars. Sorry for your loss :(
@_date: 2018-02-16 22:57:03
It sounds like you created a Blockchain.info account but eventually realized all you needed was the Coinbase account for your purposes. If you’re timeline is correct I’m not totally sure how much money you will get if you regain access to your Coinbase account but there is a wide margin or error in my guesses, plus free money is always nice. If you can get into your Coinbase account they should have record of everything you did so you’ll probably be good then. Good luck

Out of all the cryptocurrencies it is the most tried and true. You may have penny stocks that garner EQUAL gains as bitcoin but they will carry much more risk in my opinion, as long as you learn how to store your coins properly. I understand diversifying and getting involved with other interesting projects but I would recommend heeding this persons word of advice
@_date: 2017-09-17 03:29:14
There was another fork recently into Bitcoincash and if that is an indicator of anything the original chain might not lose any value whatsoever. In a sense it seemed like the fork just created ~$10 billion out of thin air, but of course it is a little more complicated than that
@_date: 2017-10-24 14:47:09
I would always recommend a hardware wallet but otherwise TAILS is a bootable OS like UBUNTU but probably with even more security features, it's what Snowden used, and it comes pre-loaded with Electrum 
@_date: 2017-10-05 16:24:25
Another point I would make it that a lot of these projects have special cases whereas Bitcoin is very good at doing something simple and broad. Therefore creating a large foundation on which many projects can be build without having to worry about the underlying infrastructure/code having problems
@_date: 2018-02-10 07:38:39

Some of the stuff wasn't adding up, he claimed he mined in 2009 but lot's of claims sounded more like 2011/12 like having "blockchains" as a section on the excel file but the format (with the dashes) sounded like blockchain.info identifiers or wallet IDs, as just one example. If that was correct then the amount that was disregarded came into question because at the time that would have been worth ~$40k I believe
@_date: 2017-09-19 20:11:11
As long as your amount stays that low an offline paper wallet would be the most secure, I recommend TAILS because it comes pre-loaded with Electrum and you can just keep the seed. Otherwise an easier option might be an old phone that you just keep off of the internet. Those are your most secure options but even a hot wallet (connected to the internet) wouldn't be so bad but I would recommend at least a solid password or 2fa if available
@_date: 2017-09-29 02:37:40
Sounds a lot lot a hard fork to me
@_date: 2017-09-13 01:08:20
Well in the end it's up to you. I would suggest getting a hardware wallet because they are easier to use, particularly for beginners, and seem more secure than even the best paper wallets. Otherwise TAILS, which you can boot from a cd or USB drive, comes pre-loaded with Electrum I believe. The second route is free but it comes with more leg work, understanding, and slightly more risk especially when you are not totally sure what you're doing

@_date: 2017-10-19 05:49:13
Correct. However, the average return you get on a stock is 5% a year and a savings account is less than 1%. If you bought Bitcoin at its peak in 2013, held through the entire bear market, and sold it today you would get a ~500% return or ~100% a year. TLDR much better returns. If you're looking for better than that you will need a casino or a lottery ticket

Yeah I guess in a sense non-legacy nodes are roughly 2mb, but here’s a graphic of the current rate of bitcoin Blockchain size
In 5 years it will probably be half the size of what you claim. The goal of Segwit was to approach the problem in ways that optimize space rather than going down the route you fear. It’s a temporary solution as other layers are developed and implemented, otherwise we would only have 7 transactions per second forever

There is the question of how new innovation, magnitudes better than bitcoin could be handled. From the typical Bitcoin argument it is open source and can be upgraded so why would it not just be upgraded like the internet? On the other hand you have you have Linux vs. Miscrosoft/Apple (at this point anyway), where walled gardens will at least get their moment (decades) in the sun. There could even be a merger from an outside group or company where it seems cooperation would be more beneficial than confrontation. The truth is nobody know until those player actually interact and this "Bitcoin 2.0" can be examined according to exactly how much better it is. Every new coin to come along is "better than bitcoin" but it seems that all the shiny new features only complicate what is supposed to be a secure foundation for the free market.

He might have done this for brevity sake, this is sort of what a lot of the buzzword around blockchain seems to be hinting at, as well as some other dimensions not spelled out here. However, without the disclaimer I have just put forth it does seem a bit misleading.

In other words his message is the "marketing argument for blockchain over Bitcoin"

If you work out all the technical details you should be in the clear. Are the passwords matched with addresses? What are blockchains in the way you're using the word? The recovery keys might be your best bet if the passwords are all mixed up or something. Depending on where you live I'm sure there is a major exchange where you can cash some out and it might not hurt to just purchase a little to play with if you are really that uncomfortable with it.

No, if you accessed the wallet then that is the correct wallet. However, if you have no funds there then you also may have used a different wallet, but that begs the question of why you wrote that one down. I would check carefully about transactions. If you have you public address we could use that to double check on the blockhain if anything has been deposited there or withdrawn, people were not as security focused back then so there is a chance someone hacked into it but there would have to be a public transaction showing funds leaving. This is a little weird and you won't really find it on the web too much but I used blockchain.info a while back and sometimes for whatever reason my funds wouldn't show up even though they were there, then if I checked back a few days later they would be there so I would check it a couple of times...

It's the profits attached to it. People are very quick to turn away from anything that feels like a sales pitch at this point, which people often confuse for Bitcoiners enthusiasm for a truly revolutionary technology (as opposed to a "revolutionary technology" SUNDAY SUNDAY SUNDAY BUY ONE GET ONE "FREE". There are plenty of uninformed people who dismiss it even though they are intelligent individuals. It's this same phenomenon that spreads into the news as well. Somebody powerful who is protecting their interests spreads defamation, journalists pick it up because it's making money and complicated, regular people pick it up. This is the nature of disruptive technology, this is the piece you are slightly missing or at least not emphasizing enough, plus where most opinions are formed. During the beginnings of cars, electiricty, assembly lines, telephones, etc. you would see very similar propaganda out there. The truth is that even though we have access to ALL info pretty much with the internet it is easier to trust "experts" who will give you a good understanding 99% of the time rather than spend the vast amount of time to truly comprehend something. This is critical thinking, congratulations on your ability to do that, a consider yourself lucky that you aren't so wrapped up in your 9-5 that you missed out on a very unique FINANCIAL revolution.

Well as for the rally $5000 seems like a good area to double top; but that's playing with fire because then the questions arise will this indeed be the top, will we see a "double-bubble scenario like throughout all of 2012, will the price ever go low enough before the next rally several years out to justify selling, paying capital gains tax, and re-buying.

Well not sure about the word egoistic but no, just the paper wallet. A hardware wallet is just as safe if not safer and is more convenient but that comes with a price tag. If you take the paper wallet route it is free but I would recommend a good bit of research, to create an offline paper wallet on a device "that has never touched the internet and never will" is very safe when done properly. I guess what I'm getting at is I need to be more specific when mentioning paper wallets because if created improperly they could be open to exploitation, regardless of whether anyone ever even becomes aware of that exploitation

That question leaves at least a decent amount of room for opinion at any time, with any investment. A general rule is that in the long run all stock go up and that is the same with Bitcoin but on steroids.

That's a relative question. If you're 22 with $5,000 in life savings it might not be a bad idea, given a positive scenario with everything else (steady job, healthy, single, etc.). However, it is a completely different scenario if you're 55 with a mortgage and $100,000 in savings, etc.

Well the amount is important. For instance most people carry $100 in their bill fold so for that much I'm sure an app would be fine for the time being. I usually distinguish around a couple of thousand is where you should (1.) thoroughly research how to properly secure an offline generated paper wallet for free or (2.) look into paying the $100 for a hardware wallet like Ledger, Trezor, or Keepkey. If you are really serious about it all I'd say hardware wallets are the better option but it's nice to know how to create an offline paper wallet 
@_date: 2017-10-18 07:04:39
You mentioned blockchains in a weird way and what you are describing sounds exactly like an "identifier" or "wallet ID" from the blockchain.info website (ex. 1111a1a1a-1a1a-1a1a-1a1a-111aaa1a1a1a). I can't really get a for certain fact of how long they have been around, or if you used them, but if not that website then maybe another one. You would need this and a password that unlocks it.
@_date: 2017-10-07 02:56:05
Bockchain.info has had plenty of problems in the past, although I haven't seen it as much lately so I don't know if they finally got their shit together or if trolls just found a better topic to complain about. Anyway, from what I understand the wallet is on the users side of the program and they do not have access to your coin which sets it apart from any online wallet I believe, especially exchanges, so that it seems you do control your keys. If all of that is correct then the only thing is that it is a "hot wallet" so a hacker could somehow come across it at any time whereas if you take proper storage methods for a larger amount like an offline generated paper wallet or a hardware wallet an attacker has to have those things physically available. There's also ways to mitigate a "wrench attack" as well such as multi-sig and "false bottoms" for lack of a better term, but I digress. I know I had a few coins stored on there awhile back and every now and then I could not get into my wallet due to some technical glitch so I quickly realized I had to figure out a more secure method.
@_date: 2017-10-31 16:19:17

Mining in general requires a lot of money as well as an inside deal on the latest mining equipment, even the "best" companies will put a 6 month waiting period or something in which the mining will not even be profitable anymore. As for cloud mining you are at the fate of trusting these same people who have had very little time to build any sort of reputation if anything. There are many other complexities but long story short it will probably be both easier and more profitable at this point to just invest directly in bitcoin if you think the price is going up. 
@_date: 2017-10-30 19:22:02
The easiest and safest way would be purchasing a hardware wallet like a Ledger Nano S of Trezor. There are other cheaper ways of accomplishing this but are complicated, and of course if you only have a small amount an exchange might not be too bad as long as you use 2 factor authentication

Yes, this is the main argument put forth with inflationary currencies. How do you think current interest rates for borrowing are calculated? Do they not take into account inflation? Maybe with maturity 50/100/500 years from now Bitcoin will become an even more stable factor to base the interest rate equation on but for now (because of the Diffusion of Innovation Adoption Surve) the interest rates would have to be based on a basket of other assets, this would make for a more predictable basis for interest rates than inflationary currencies anyway

They probably will not listen to you but since they've made a decent profit try to convince them to at least get their initial investment out

With Trezor you control your keys and your coins. No real need for them to announce anything. They will probably even help you split your coins if you decide to go that route just like with the last fork but that has no bearing on the safety of your coins. This is in comparison to say Coinbase where it is not clear which chain they will allow "your" coins to be on

This method only makes it harder to run and node, and therefore more centralized. Honestly, a 2mb fork would not have been that bad in the short term, and everyone more or less knows it, the problem is opening that door would lead to larger forks down the road.

1. Mining is basically not profitable for most people at this point, basically unless you have a large sum of money and a hookup on mining equipment. This could change depending on mining difficulty (basically amount of people mining) and the price. As for an investment profitability is based on supply and demand but with there being only 21 million bitcoin in existence there is huge potential upside still.
2. I'm not the most qualified to answer this one but it has helped facilitate this. Bitcoin itself seems to be trying to move into other directions but alternative crypto-currencies will likely fulfill this niche for the foreseeable future.
3. Relative anonymity to prevent your credit card information being stolen when making purchases on a shady website, lower fees than a credit card, store of value (not really related to transactions exactly), and faster than credit card verification. 
4. It's just about as safe as you want it to be. If done properly it can be safer than any bank but the problem is that most people are too lazy to go through these precautions, although in their defense this process is not always the most user friendly at this point. It is more than secure enough for large transactions, again done properly, although the market cap is currently only around 4 billion so it depend on your definition of large.
5. The best way to go about this at this point would be to immediately convert your bitcoins into cash through a service such as Bitpay which do it immediately. Even regular cash has some volatility involved and eventually bitcoin may become just as stable if not more stable than these currencies seeing as it could become a world currency. The best metaphor for this is a row boat compared to a tanker in a rough ocean, which the size of the ship referring to the market cap, where a tanker is not fazed by natural waves.
6. Well if you buy bitcoin from most major sites they require a decent amount of information but as you move them to different wallets or use services such as mixers it can become very difficult. There are other methods that one could use here as well but long story short nothing is 100% NSA proof.
7. The answer here of course depends upon why you value bitcoins. One of the toughest things with bitcoin is that it is outside the jurisdiction of any court. They can go after the places where you convert is to and from cash for a specific country but any regulation runs the risk of inhibiting the growth of a potential tremendously advantageous technology while at the same time potentially putting your country at a disadvantageous position with many other countries who have allowed this technology to flourish. I think it could be good to see a little regulation to help people feel more comfortable with this but innovation is so fast at this point that pandora's box can only be taped shut so many times.
I am really not an expert by any means and these are just some brief answers through which you could start further research if deemed necessary. Good luck!

@_date: 2017-09-03 22:05:41
That's only assuming that for whatever reason you have USD to begin with. If you have both you will get rid of the less valuable one I believe is that bottom line. That does not seem to make a great case for inflation at all. The basis of the argument is surrounding the conclusions based on a monopoly of the money. As a general rule inflation is better for lenders and the USD is all debt at this point. From a user perspective though why would I ever want money that is inherently less valuable?

Yeah bitcoin mining, as others have stated, is probably outside of your realm for profitability. I would highly suggest research into all of it. It's possible to get some high powered GPUs and mine some coins on their way up, USB miners will never get you anything at this point. The good thing about GPUs is that it is easy to switch between different coins according to what is most profitable at the time, and there are mining pools/ software that help you keep track of this. I'm pretty sure bitcoincash is mined mostly by ASICs so that is probably out of the question even though someone else mentioned it. And of course all of this begs the question of what I faced 4 years ago. "Between lack of expertise and expected profitability ratio of mining vs. simply holding, would it not be essentially as profitable and much easier to just invest directly?" Again, do your own research and don't trust me or anyone else on here (just as I did) but the answer today for me of course remains the same as it did then

Well ultimately you would end up paying less Bitcoin if enough time had passed but it would have to continually be recalculated.

Yes, but only to the level where it is profitable. It sounds as if you think it will become too costly to mine but that is impossible, if this situation were to occur then a chunk of miners will stop mining and the difficulty will drop and make it profitable again

Well first of all in my opinion I would not go with litecoin, do your own research but long story short litecoin became popular because miners could use GPUs for the Scrypt mining when bitcoin's Sha256 or whatever was not profitable with the GPUs when then were replaced with ASICs. You could research some of the other ones and although I'm not as quick as some people to disregard altcoins I highly doubt anything out there is truly worth it at this point. Besides that probably your best bets if you were truly set on this would be btc-e or cryptsy or maybe a few other places. 
@_date: 2015-04-09 02:54:42
The biggest exchanges to buy from in the US is Coinbase and Circle. Outside of the US the main one that I know of is Bitstamp. So depending on your location all of these would be good just one might be cheaper. Coinbase had funding from the NYSE so it is pretty trustworthy and is a decent place to hold small amounts of funds, especially with 2FA (2 factor authentication). This is basically where they will call your phone and give you a code, separate from your password, every time you log in. It seems very reliable but the beauty of bitcoin is that you don't have to trust a company to have your funds, a normal bank like Wells Fargo or someone usually only keeps 10% of the money they claim to have and loans out the rest so if there were to be a major bank run like the great depression people might end up shit out of luck. You might want to therefore look into paper wallets and multi sig addresses to secure larger amounts and just play around with these things until they become comfortable to you. It is a lot to take in and never invest more than you can lose but trust me you will get the hang of it.

You have to understand that it will "cost" a certain amount but the point of mining is not just to break even. Therefore, you could liken it to costing nothing or a negative amount, although there is some gamble always involved in all economics

I don't understand what you're asking exactly. This is the price you pay for a decentralized monetary system, who knows what the banking fees are combined with inflation. If you have a better system let it out onto the free market. As far as miners go they will mine as long as it is profitable, if it isn't profitable then difficulty will drop until it is, thus equilibrium.

I think there is a deeper process going on here. I don't think this distinction is completely a conscious  thing. This is the mass societal conversation/ideology about money coming to terms with trustlessness, both economically and in general. In other words, the first reaction people have about "new currency" is that it is a scam because it is current knowledge that the validity of currency coincides with the validity of the authority of the institution creating it. Then, there came the realization that there is more to this currency than meets the eye upon first inspection, aka the trustless ledger. Finally, there will be the realization that ultimately these two are intertwined. Most people underestimate or do not understand the importance of authority, especially legitimate authority, in modern society so the full scale of what this means will take some time. It may sound a little ostentatious but this is paradigm shifting regardless of how successful it becomes.

I don't understand where the attack vector is?

I think that's what you're getting at? You're final statement is exactly the purpose of scaling with 2nd, 3rd, etc. layers (basically how the internet itself scaled), the 1 TB scenario you're describing is exactly what was avoided with the BCash split

I am not well versed in that specific type of information but it shouldn't be all that hard to find. Probably magnitudes easier than researching everything involved with setting up a mining operation. No you will not directly get anything but this is a tremendous help to the network and you will be basically losing the same amount of money through electricity usage as you would running a miner at your given price levels, or anywhere near those levels for that matter

One of the best things to do is just play around with a bit, just get like $0.50 or something and just move it around on some wallets (web wallets, phone wallets, exchanges, etc.) to get a feel for it, it's super easy and similar to email.

"World mined gold production has peaked four times since 1900: in 1912, 1940, 1971, and 2001, each peak being higher than previous peaks. The latest peak was in 2001, when production reached 2,600 metric tons, then declined for several years.[5] Production started to increase again in 2009, spurred by high gold prices, and achieved record new highs each year from 2011 through 2015, when production reached 3,100 tonnes. Early estimates of 2016 gold production indicate that it was flat to 2015 production, at 3,100 tonnes.[6]"

Yes, you can just give the address to someone and receive while offline. Also, you can check your address on blockchain.info or somewhere to make sure you received the transaction by just inputing that same public address, so for the most part you don't even need to check on the device itself to make sure you are receiving any transactions

If you can create adoption incentive based on a system that rewards people for not taking risks be my guest. Theoretically a fairer system from the ground up would work because people just understand that it is better, but that's not the way the world works currently. You are foolish if you think that is the only aspect of Bitcoin that makes it decentralized/centralized but given the way the world works currently the profit incentive bootstrapped the system into existence; it's always easier to critique things after the fact but the truth is an algorithm for distribution had to be chosen and there is potential that one placing less emphasis on bootstrapping the system with early adopters would have never gotten off the ground in the first place. Here is the problem with theories, a perfect design may never be found so maybe we should just focus on pragmatic aspects of creating an entirely new world financial system; or you can keep using USD and theorizing your perfect version, I'm sure your shitcoin could compete

Um... eventually!? Besides the outlying possibility of a tremendous stroke of luck, like way better odds of winning the lottery than discovering a private address with a balance or discovering a block with a weak computer. Actually the more appropriate response is that, according to percentages and other numbers, you would technically be losing less money over time through electricity mining than you would searching for this private address, in reality though both of these would most likely result in the same thing, no money and wasted electrical and computer costs. I guess with a more powerful computer you could join a mining pool and that would become profitable so in that regard you are right but anyone who knows enough to set up a profitable mining operation at this point would already be more than aware of that  
@_date: 2018-04-20 21:37:45

For that paper wallet to be truly secure you would need to generate it offline. I can give you a guide but it can be rather complex. If it's not a large sum then it's probably just as safe as the mobile wallets (I'm not sure on that, I just assume) but if it's larger you might want to really think about a hardware wallet. Andreas Antonopolous talks a bit about how they are safer than paper wallets as well. Actually a lot of my offline tutorials that I have saved are a bit dated so I would recommend your own research if that is the case

Well the scarceness of gold was in a historical sense more than in the present although both are at least somewhat true. Yes bitcoin would be slightly less scarce at those levels but compared to the estimated $1000000000000000 net worth of everything... or something like that both of these numbers are indeed scarce as long as bitcoin keeps becoming more popular. Divisibility does not make bitcoin any less scarce because it does not change the total, the same could in theory be done with gold where you can use a micro drill of some sort to chip of dollars or pennies. Adding more zeros after a decimal place does not change the number, it could just allow for it to be even more divisible.

It's historical use is what gives it value at this point, along with the many people who have a vested interest in maintaining that historical value on one level or another. I think this is at least part of what you're getting at albeit in the vaguest way possible. How gold got this historical value is not coincidental, besides the fact that it is currently more valued than silver, because it is resistant to corrosion and tends to be scarce in nature. 
We can all be as vague as possible because ultimately there is always an exception to a rule but that is no reason to say we don't know anything, in that 2+2=4 is useful even though on some quantum level that is even beginning to look like there is an exception. In other words I think a good bit of people here understand gold and bitcoin. In fact in the case of bitcoin we have the source code so all that it encompasses can in fact be known but we do not possess the "human or universe's source code" and how that interacts may be somewhat of a mystery still.
@_date: 2015-11-23 19:18:35
It's also a potential store of value given that it is a scarce resource. Those two things combined could overwhelm the societal function of money with a personal function from intelligent consumers... that's a big if though

What jtos3 said.

Well I go back and forth over Socialism... but I think I have 2 main answers to your question. First, it seems Sanders and Paul both see the corruption of major financial institutions as a huge problem, they just have different solutions; one says better laws, the other says actual free market competition. The pragmatist in me has learned it is better to actively solve particular problems rather than squabble over ideologies. My second answer is that I don't think money will ever disappear, as some might, so when you really break it down a ledger of keeping track of value (when worded this way especially) is much closer to what money would look like in a true world socialism or communism (as opposed to any nation backed Socialism or Communism with capital letters)

Well scarceness in this case is concerning the fraction of what you have versus the known amount that will be minted and when. By your analogy gold earrings are not really scarce at all either. In fact nothing is scarce when you break it down to atoms etc.

It would still be a gamble no matter what percentage of miners happened to go along. Inherently switching to what I guess you could call a more inflationary system in the short term would result in just that, short term gains... I could go on but in general it just does not seem favorable enough for anywhere near 51% of the network to go along with

From what I understand the seed is much more difficult to crack than it appears at first because it is not only the words themselves but also the specific order they are in. This really is exactly what you will be looking to do in your situation outside of possibly getting someone else to buy a hardware wallet for you and even going so far as to not have any computer that you use with the hardware wallet connecting back to you, although I'm not sure how much that last part would really matter

Well first of all it's bitcoin and you would most likely be transferring bitcoin from one wallet to another, the connotation is slightly different than having an account. As for the rest of your questions there is a weird relationship between bitcoin being purchased using paypal because a number of factors make it easy to lie and say the bitcoin was never actually given, leaving them with both the money and the bitcoin, so it will usually carry a risk or a premium to do so. The best thing to do is to link a bank account to Coinbase or Bitstamp and have the money transferred directly between them and your bank.
@_date: 2015-10-13 00:49:34
Yeah I don't necessarily agree with that guy because... you know, free market and such. This is all more or less theoretical, but the formulas in economics are very real despite their theoretical nature. There are many factors at play and the 10x increase would be due to FOMO in a speculative bubble and not totally due to any fundamental reasoning, outside of price will go higher than when I buy. Plus, you're looking at that increase in a linear fashion whereas major adoption of bitcoin would progress exponentially like most technology does, but in an even more exaggerated fashion because the reward is exponentially decreasing.

That's just the first source I came across, I thought this was just general knowledge at this point. As far as them paying this money back goes you are correct and that is a positive note for them as long as they keep their nose clean but what is to stop them from doing this again or how can we be sure that these companies will have as much success in paying it back if there is a next time. It seems these bad actors should be dealt with judicially to prevent this from happening again but, like I said before, we are yet to see any new major structures in place to address this concern.

It is very bait and switch like. The same thing happened to me and I was met with this same criticism. It just seems like they should at least include a statement on the page specifying that this works only once the full transaction has cleared at your bank, aka 4 business days later. I was very upset by this as well. Like all the links used said that the offer was still valid, and it was known at that time that it would be exactly 4 business days before it went through, so there really should have been a warning pointed out before the purchase was finalized. Yes, read the fine print but for a major website that thrives on trust this feels a little fucked up.

Well this may be a stretch but anything more along the lines of peer reviewed articles? Some of this I can't really make a call without deeper research but from the surface... it's just some guy making claims, such as most of those videos. The Greenpeace monocle guy I just made a value call and don't trust him, yeah you can place the blame squarely on me for that one. Dr. Koonin, the former Obama administration official, was a former BP chief scientist so using my criteria from earlier comments he's out for me as well. I did like Freeman Dyson because he didn't seem to invested one way or another and was simply saying we should not condemn scientists for "dissent" and this is exactly what science is build out of. I might have to look into his research more and find other people that he is working with, etc. Also I've always thought the overall perspective of more long term trends was always interesting but standing alone I don't think it completely answers the problem. Sorry to start this conversation so combatitively, it seems that you are at least closer to objective about this than I originally suspected.
"heretics" have historically been an important force in driving scientific progress. "[H]eretics who question the dogmas are needed ... I am proud to be a heretic. The world always needs heretics to challenge the prevailing orthodoxies."

So you probably either want to contribute to maintaining the network or you want to obtain bitcoin. Given those tow scenarios you are either going to want to buy the bitcoins outright which will be far easier and will probably even be cheaper. If you want to contribute to the network it would be much, much more effective if you ran a full node instead.
@_date: 2015-11-06 17:30:48
National currencies may not be on the same team though. Many countries would love to see the USD fall as the reserve currency and although they would probably rather have their own replace it, they may settle for a "neutral" one rather than an oppositional one. This is of course at a point where bitcoin is blatantly a threat though so not for the foreseeable future, if even possible at all. 
@_date: 2015-10-01 16:35:35
It's not the fact that you switched, or that there was a 30 day period or anything. What has bothered me is that we used the referral link that said $75 and bought the bitcoin on the spot and it is either between the time the bitcoin order was placed and when it actually went into their account that the offer became invalid or the multiple links that said $75 were already invalid. I have a feeling it was the former but either way it still feels like a bait and switch...
@_date: 2015-03-08 21:13:31
I think you're right. People don't understand the importance of decentralization and the need for a trustless database, whether the use is monetary or not. I think people will catch on to the other uses outside of monetary at first, not that they are easily separated or if that's even possible, but with a little time it will become obvious why this is actually even more important for monetary uses.

Gotcha, well the amount of bitcoin you will get will continually become less and less as the difficulty goes up so that is at least part of why that info may be a little difficult. No matter what the miners you research should provide it's output hashrate and with that info, and finding the other correct info online, you can make your calculations with this: 
At the level your looking for a miner should not be too difficult to find but I still feel I have to advise you to look out for scams, these can be very frequent at the actual profitable levels in one form or another.

Day trading or short term profits are chaotic in any market but this is probably even more the case here. As someone else mentioned you might have better luck lurking around r/bitcoinmarkets every now and then to get a feel for what's going on, as well as learning general stock trader language and strategies. You might actually be much better off though just buying a little bit here and there with your extra income and learning to store it properly. The short term carries a lot of background noise making the price unpredictable but for those who are truly impressed with the technology and see a bright future for it the long game is where any real money could be found.

It's possible that they realize how essential public mining is to this technology and choose to keep that intact but insist on controlling the mining rewards, as well as built in taxing mechanisms. I'm sure they probably wouldn't want this transparency but given bitcoin continuing to be a success they might have to make some temporary compromises in an attempt to stifle value. Odds are though that they will not want to embrace what is essentially the one thing that is so revolutionarily innovative, aka decentralized ledger.

Let me say the decentralized aspect of it all seems like part of the problem here. It is a technology and there is no "main app" (although there are popular companies, etc.). If you live in America Coinbase or Circle may be the way to go which are both highly respected, highly involved with NYSE, and completely compliant with all pertinent laws. A little bit may be safe on there (~$500 maybe or so depending on how much money you have or are willing to risk) with 2 factor authentication even though many on this sub will not like me saying that. As for very large amounts you might have to do a little research for some of the more secure methods (paper wallets, mnemonic phrases, mulit-sig, etc.) but for the impatient purchasing a Trezor has proven to be very secure and may be the way you should go. No one ever has any time, but I'm going to go on to say that continuing your research may be good. Not so much under the hood type stuff but just the questions you asked cannot be answered in a way to make you completely understanding of it all at this point.

Well your location is really more relevant to purchasing bitcoins rather than advice about your wallet. Besides that though it's important to distinguish what you are using the wallet for (tinkering, small amounts, savings, investments, etc.) because different uses require different levels of security. I know it's weird discussing amounts but it's all pretty relative because what may be a lot to you may not be to someone else. Since you are new I would recommend just playing around with things or dealing with small amounts at first and if you would like to deal with larger amounts research and play around with the more secure features using small amounts until you feel confident using those measures for larger amounts.

Multisig paper wallets for the win. This may be as much of a revolution as bitcoin itself if it becomes user friendly
@_date: 2015-02-08 08:19:54
Well mining solo you can only solve one block (not to mention block-halvings and difficulty adjustments) which pays out 25 btc currently. This would mean the actual odds of getting this block would be pushed to 74x25=1875 years. Also that is not 100% guarantee either, that is on average. So in other words just like there being an "astronomical" chance of hitting a block instantly there's pretty good odd it will actually take longer than 1875 years. You really have better odds of winning the lottery, but free electricity and no real gains from pooled mining means you could do this for the super long shot of hitting a block. I mean it is free and as long as it is not taxing mentally or too time consuming it's not hurting anything.

I think this is basically a hard fork in cryptocurrencies
@_date: 2015-02-08 05:46:24
Okay so I'm not 100% on this but the currency and it's innovations go hand in hand. On the one side is of course innovation through open source, which cannot be copyrighted, on the other is security through large usage. Given these two parameters it is inevitable. Gatescoin will not be open-source and anything open-source that truly trumps bitcoin will have it's protocall or specifications adopted. This seems to point towards inevitability, although again I'm not the most technical.

It's per block and the percentage of market supply is not exactly relevant here. Those coins will, in theory, continue to cancel out so there's no point in even mentioning them. As for the 3600 a day, that becomes only 1800 a day sold or a drop from $900,000 to $450,000 a day in selling pressure, so an extra $450,000 a day at current levels (price, 100% daily mining sales, difficulty, etc.)

I've been drinking so don't listen to anything I have to say at this point lol. I will say it though, for some reason Mycelium has always stuck in my head and it might just be a funny name but I also feel like there might be huge potential from you guys. Also from this past response it only makes me think of how ahead of the game programmers/ etc. involved with bitcoin are, especially ones with good reputations, so be weary of your Kim Dotcom opportunities as opposed to your Assange ones because in the long run, at this point, this grey hat may be better for everyone.

I normally state that price as about the minimum to get into mining and ward off people who aren't at least semi-serious/ confident in their understanding of the enormous complexities that come along with both researching and setting up bitcoin mining, really trying to save them time. However with your previous experiences and money I would recommend thorough research on bitcointalk.org for current understandings because they would have much more knowledgeable people, and more of them on this subject. Let me just add that I don't know the current conversion rate, scams are everywhere, chip manufacturers seem to be using chips until barely profitable anymore before selling them (greater profit incentive), the simplicity of investment vs. mining, and of course reiterate what someone else said about most places have a waiting list and the chips can burn out. With all that being said I really can't recommend mining without basically a hookup aka knowing a breakthrough chip developer but I was once on your quest as well with less money and experience so best of luck in your research and potential endeavors.

The most important things you may have missed is that it is scarce, only 21 million will ever be created, and infinitely divisible. Imagine if you could divide gold into a small enough piece to buy a fraction of a stick of gum. At this point private keys on your hard drive for large amounts are vulnerable to hacking unless proper precautions are taken. The guy from the wikipedia article trashed his computer before the price went up so he didn't realize they were worth anything until it was too late, so if he knew better he could have easily moved the coins before said trashing. Coinmap.org is a good resource but there are also many online places that accept it (microsoft, overstock, expedia, dell, dish, newegg, some major dating sites, some major porn sites, etc.) if you can't find much near you.

"Admit that the price won't rise again"... see... here's the thing. You sound very sure of that... and yet I'm very sure you are wrong... therefore I think this question is a troll. Obviously this sub thinks the price will rise again. With that being said even $500 would not be enough to shake me out. A price below that in the year 2025 would be disheartening but in all honesty that is not a possibility in my mind, therefore I don't worry about it, and I think you will buy in for higher around $35k

Thank you so much. This may in fact be a great treasure trove for me. Simple searches among peer reviewed articles turns up supporters of global warming of course and then things like fact vs. fiction, etc. always ends up siding with the proponents of global warming. Science is increasingly in a weird place because of post-modernism and decentralization of the media but this is why democracy uses super majorities rather than regular ones, and even then it is important to remain skeptical. It's just hard for a broad discipline like sociology or this subject (science) in particular to filter through without meeting certain criteria like large, objective counter-argument groups but this might change my study on this completely, once I have time to actually sort through some of it of course.

I'm sure there is a bitcoin Yoda in Vegas somewhere but I'm not totally sure where, from just being around here though I frequently here about how interested in bitcoin a casino in Vegas called The D is so that might be a good place to begin for discussion but I don't know how much professional advice they're willing to dish out beyond a friendly conversation.

There is no such thing as zombies, unless you are referring to fiat of course.
@_date: 2016-07-20 03:33:50
Well I don't really think the bitcoin part is necessarily the problem. When obtaining bitcoin you can pay in cash or send someone else to pay in cash and keep your identity anonymous. The real problem lies in tracking your bank account. For instance you could create an exchange that automatically tumbles coins but then the laws would crack down on them. If this truly became a problem I guarantee a solution would arise. Why? Because problems have an incentive to be fixed.

I'm not sure if emulated is the right word or not but you can download and verify TAILS from the website and run it on a Windows computer. It is a separate OS altogether where you will be booting from a disc or usb drive rather than the computers hard drive itself. Be warned though that once turned off TAILS was made to erase all data but you might want to research how to be completely sure this is done, as well as other helpful hints about TAILS

My point still stands because all you have to do is copy and paste to understand how simple it is. I'll give you that it's a little different with larger sums of money, which should always be typed out, but even if you just mess up a letter or two it will normally refuse to send because the address will become in invalid format. The only time they actually send it to a wrong address either with copy/paste or simply sending it to another valid receiver they have recorded that is not the one they intended to send to at that time. Thus, ABSOLUTELY no different than sending an email. How many times have you heard the story about accidentally hitting reply all? Email will fail!

In that scenario yes you spend bad money and keep good money. Ultimately though would you not want only good money? Then you would be 100% Bitcoin, then when you get hungry you would spend Bitcoin because that is all you have and you are hungry. If someone would accept a handful of dirt as payment I would use that rather than Bitcoin or fiat. Does that make dirt a better currency?
@_date: 2015-02-11 06:38:18

@_date: 2018-12-07 19:17:41
That is basically the worst thing you can do. Buy high and sell low. It would have been better, probably far better in this scenario, to buy in low but the thing is... nobody really 100% knows where low is, so buying a temporary high is better than not buying at all, but the one caveat to that is that you do not sell, before the right time at least. Amazon fell greater than 95% in 2001 and I'd say Bitcoin is in a better position than it was then, the main difference is the bipolar swings Bitcoin's price does

Use two factor security for now for sure. Basically at what level can you justify the $50-$100. If you only have $40 in Bitcoin it might be hard to justify spending the same amount on a hardware wallet, but upwards of that in the midst of a bear market bottom(ish) you might want to start playing around with one.

A currency does not need to be lended and do you really think the US dollar is asset backed? It may appear that way but since we have gotten away from the gold standard it only has the appearance that it is asset backed. For example your bank might get robbed or something and you may be backed up but with banks loaning 10 times the physical dollar amount... you know what watch the south park episode about space dollars, what intrinsic value does gold really have if we don't agree that it has value?

There's a couple of tickers and in my personal opinion prices will probably be going up somewhere around sun-tues because mon is when coinbase will be available for transactions which is probably going to take the lead in the US for now so I would say get in before then or see if this spike causes any huge cashouts and subsequent panics sales. But the last mini crash a few days ago only went to around $500 so there is no telling what this next "bubble" will do. This is just my opinion but this is basically my short term strategy for now, also all of this is probably going to be building for a good while so saddle up and get ready for the rough ride on the roller coaster to the moon.

I highly doubt 95% of current miners would go along with that. I think some of my other points are already covered so I'll just stick with this part. For me to even imagine the proposed 95% agreement it would basically have to entail enough powerful entities have entered mining that are enthusiastic enough about inflation to commit to this that basically the entire current network would constitute the leftover 5%, this is all theoretical btw. This does not even mention the instant sell off due to a deflationary currency becoming inflationary and the subsequent mining response to follow. Overall though it seems that we would simply have a fork here with one being inflationary and the other deflationary with both of them surviving, which I do see as a very real possibility before any deflationary currency winning out altogether.

Research it in depth and see if you think this is something that could be around in 10 years, then invest only what you can lose if you want to.

I have not attempted any withdrawels through there, although I have purchased the same way you did basically through a lack of other opportunities, but I'm pretty sure there is a 2500 EUR/ day limit. That's what it says on this Wikipedia page.

16 It also forced all people, great and small, rich and poor, free and slave, to receive a mark on their right hands or on their foreheads, 17 so that they could not buy or sell unless they had the mark, which is the name of the beast or the number of its name.

Here's a bit of a start

Well if you consider that there is around 7 trillion American dollars in print, the banks lend out 9 times more money than they have printed, for simplistic purposes the American dollar makes up 10% of all currency, and with the rapid innovation of technology it could be estimated that one bitcoin could reasonably be worth $1,000,000 (20,000,000,000,000,000 divided by 20,000,000 bitcoins, again super ruff estimate for illustrating a possibility) given that it almost completely takes over currencies.

I've done specific identification but it can be complicated and you have to keep detailed records of exactly which portions are accounted for as sold for taxing purposes, lot's of decimal points and math

I really feel like there's more

Well that's why I said the American dollar is only 10% of all currency although this is not something I looked up at all

The next bubble will burst but I'm putting my money on the fact that we haven't even seen that begin to happen yet, and then it probably will fall to a price higher than what happened a few days ago

The next step is to find out which alternative crypto currencies are likely to succeed and which ones would be most favorable to the world. Bitcoin will probably be a staple for a good minute but there are several reasons for that.
