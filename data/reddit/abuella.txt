bitcoin and any emerging currency goes through a string of bubbles while it's in "price seeking mode". Bitcoin likely has 3 or 4 more to get through, what's more interesting is the exponential size of each bubble. 
they are splitting the ledger to test a new blockchain protocol that may or may not be successful as bitcoin scales up.

people have been saying that since bitcoin hit $100 years ago. It's projected to rise to $500k or more in the next few years. If that prediction comes true like all the others have, $6k will seem like a steal.

that sucks but it's not too late to still benefit from early adoption, this is still considered early stages of a parabolic curve.

it's only volatile right now because less than 1% of the global population is involved in it, so distribution is low and price seeking is high as it opens into new markets. As the technology improves and cryptocurrencies disseminate all over the world and billions of people begin to have access to them, the enormous fluctuations in price that we see from single buy or sell orders will become far less influential, and the price movement will become far more granular. The more people using the currency, the higher the value and the more stable the market will be. This is the strength of networks and decentralised markets, the bigger they get, the more stable and robust they become. It's basically like an algorithm computing for a global economic truth - the ultimate sum value of global wealth divided by 21 million total mined BTC or whichever cryptocurrency wins the race to number one.

it's going to be volatile when less than 1% of the global population is invested in it. It will find it's equilibrium when technology allows the other 99% of the planet gain access, and global wealth is divided by 21 million mined BTC or whichever currency wins the race.

price discovery mode. exactly. it's organically seeking it's true price. estimated to one day be the sum total of global wealth divided by 21 million mined BTC - or whichever crypto wins the race to dominate.

whatever your strategy is. Leveraging and trading an expanding market is usually a quick way to lose money. People that have just bought the dips continuously over time and held in BTC and rode the waves up and down without selling have seen the biggest returns overall.

Someone doesn't understand blockchain technology or what a smart contract is. Google Vitalik Buterin.
