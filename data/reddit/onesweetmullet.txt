Hey there and thanks for stopping by!
**Site link:**
* [
Cryptoticker.org started off as a pet project of mine about a month ago. My original goal was to build a web application that I could connect to in order to view various crypto currencies at a glance without having to go to several different sites at once. I wanted something lightweight enough to run on my phone, but attractive enough that I didn't mind having it up on a second screen on my desktop. I wanted the ability to easily track or untrack markets.
There are no huge images that clog your phone's bandwidth. There are no ads. There is no registration. There are no cookies. Just simple data in an easy to read format!
**Some features:**
* You can re-order the list however you want. Click and drag on a tile's title a place it in the order you desire.
* You can add or remove markets by clicking "Select Market" and checking the markets you want to watch.
* Minimalist design using a metro-style UI that is very lightweight.
* You can change the background color to whatever you want.
* Don't like the tile's color scheme? Click "Grid colors" and it will re-roll a new scheme for you.
* You can resize any tile to make it more visible at a glance.
* You can save your layout at any time by clicking "Save layout" and copying and pasting the URL in the textbox. There are no cookies, so use that URL to bring you right back where you left off.
* You can get the last 7 days market data and see it in a chart by clicking on a tile's chart icon.
**What's coming?**
* A comparison charts page where you can select multiple markets at once and view them all in a singular chart.
* (maybe) Email notifications for when a particular market's value hits a certain threshold.
* Toying with the notion of pulling recent thread titles/links from the subreddits. 
If you want to see a particular market that's not listed on cryptoticker, let me know and I'll see about adding it. :)
Again, thanks for taking a look.

You have to win The Island lottery of course...

The comments link is at the top of the article.

True. But the issue still remains that I can't make a bank wire transfer go any faster.

Totally agree. The exchange rate for BTC to USD is so volatile right now. So much so that I have trouble being willing to risk a $100 cup of coffee or a 2 million dollar deep dish pizza.

Very awesome car, man! Would love to see or hear it in action.
If I had the BTC to sell, I probably would have done the same.
@_date: 2013-04-02 19:54:49
I have not- though the notion scares me.

Use a heavier hammer.

Gold is at ~$1478 per ounce at the moment. So in essence you bought BTC at $105.57 each?
I'd have a hard time parting with that much gold. But good luck to you!

Very awesome, Mr. BitCoinBillionaire. Stay classy!

The same could be said about the predictability of any number of the more liberal media channels.
Media bias. Pandering to one group of people while completely offending another. Unbiased mainstream media seems to be in short supply these days.
Inform yourself as best you can and make your own educated decisions according to what you believe in. It seems like the vast majority of people in the world simply pick a side and let main stream media tell them how they should think.

I don't want to sound like the guy with his head buried in the sand, but BFL has yet to deliver a single order. Or am I wrong?

I feel your pain.
I used their integration with CapitalOne360 last week on Monday. It took 4 days just to get my cash moved from my Chase account to CapitalOne360. 
On Friday of last week, I initiated a transfer to Bitfloor from CapitalOne360. The money has been withdrawn from my CapitalOne360, but is nowhere to be seen on Bitfloor.
I would have loved to use their Bank of America deposit method, but we don't have a single BOA location in my state.

Thanks for the link, but it appears they're completely out of stock on everything.

I misread Zidane's post. Zidane was referring to the comments for that story. My apologies, Zidane.
Not all of the comments are completely off-base, though. Taken from [


That said, I haven't taken the dive into purchasing BTC yet, but it's something I'm definitely interested in and watching closely.

Maybe people are cashing out because they're worried that the bubble is going to pop?
I'm curious to see where the market will be in the next couple weeks with the introduction of the BTC ATM in Cyprus. Will people there continue to put faith in BTC or will the demand there fall?

And now we're at $828...
