Lol rip off place. Who would pay those high fees? 
@_date: 2018-01-07 20:28:05
Before that happens  you do the smart thing and exchange your btc to some other growing crypto :)

11k would be crashing. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:18:31
Make it stop daddy.
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:40:36
Lol look at the chart it's dropping fast. I think whales selling out. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:33:18
Just a question. Never seen bitcoin drop like this, no need for salt. Rather here what people's opinions are? 
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:08:29
Bitcoin crash? And this time it's not bitcoin cash. Just hold. Or maybe all the better alts starting to bleed bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:35:38
Anything below 11.5k will likely equal a massive sell off. Hold strong hope for the best but be ready if this time it decides to go down. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:13:39
Might end up going lower or higher we are in a natural area right now. The real dip might be around 13k or it might just raise off of the 14.7k area. 
@_date: 2018-09-12 15:08:11
Its all scam 
@_date: 2017-12-05 06:17:42
Had to screen shot what you wrote. Beautiful. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:30:52
Nice read but it it drops to 12.5 I am out man lol.

People when btc reaches 6000 we need to rely together and buy a crapload. Battle against Bch.
@_date: 2017-11-17 07:48:23
Check coin market cap. Bch is raising pretty fast and btc is falling a bit. Looks like another pump might be starting. I hate these pumps. People hold on btc or buy more btc, looks like it's starting  late when the west is sleeping. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 20:41:30
Only if the Bch train stops if the Bch train continues prepare for the worst people. Btc right now is being challenged.

No don't buy bitcoin yet. Wait and see what bitcoin cash does (if the korean pump and other support rises it) and bitcoin might go even lower for a day or so or who knows, maybe for a while. Don't buy bitcoin until you see it start to barley get in the green. Check charts at least every 5 hours.

Penis Pumping but never stays erect too long before it flops down lol
@_date: 2017-11-14 18:17:25
For day to day use light coin would be a better option. Bit on is like gold. Better used for buying a house or cars. Store of value. Day to day use I don't see bitcoin every taking off In the main stream unless transactions fees become lower and the bitcoin transactions become super fast. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 18:05:22
Op this Bch spike is huge it will eventually drop but Bch will spike again and again. Have a feeling it could over take btc eventually unless btc spikes big. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 00:41:06
People don't give in to the korean penis pump. Wait a few days to see what happens. Have a feeling bitcoin going to bounce back in about three days with an explosion. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 00:51:40
Yep and best way to give them the middle finger is to buy more bitcoin at the lowest dip. We seen this before don't fall for bcrash threat. Just hold and buy at dip. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 16:15:16
A nice token for tips. Cute doggy lol. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 02:31:44
I would say probably. If it continues on this downhill trend for a few more days. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 07:03:20
Bitcoin cash in mad voice lol
@_date: 2018-04-01 07:57:57
Btc buy at 4k lol. Maybe go down to zero hahaha.
