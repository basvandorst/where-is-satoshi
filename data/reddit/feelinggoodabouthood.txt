A third option is long-term consolidation with a narrowing trading range. That is the best scenario for creating a solid base for the next leg up.

Anyone who gets a margin call on stock equities would meet that commitment by selling off some of  their crypto assets to realize this gains.

you need a wall of worry to have prices increase. Its when everyone is long that the top gets put in. Ie @ 19,000.
Today's move is in tandem with all other risk assets that have taken a beating in light of the 30 yr bond breaking 3.0%, along with the VIX breaking out to 14.

If Bitcoin were a true currency, meaning sovereign states would accept tax payments in bitcoin, than there would be no tax event from switching from one currency to the next. The realized gain because of one currency appreciation against another is not taxable.
Bitcoin futures markets are forced to settle into us dollars at the end of each trading day.

If he used all of his proceeds from his btc sale to get into bch, then he has a problem. Especially since he ended up using half of those funds to get back into bch.

It's called paper market vs physical market. Study gold and gld etf.

Exactly. If you put the chart upside down, that would look like a super bullish chart.

if you never sell, you never make a profit. paying taxes are great when you are sitting on fat profits, and you cash out for making expenses and such. When you use cashed out funds to try and time getting back, in, and start to trade back and forth, thats when the tax bill becomes a nightmare.

The Squeeze relies on the premise that stocks constantly experience periods of high volatility, followed by low volatility. Equities that are at six-month low levels of volatility, as demonstrated by the narrow distance between Bollinger Bands®, generally demonstrate explosive breakouts.

Bullish on blockchain, bearish on bitcoin. Bitcoin is the Netscape of the internet. Feel sorry for all the bag holders that are in the pray and hold mode. 
I wonder how many miners have been audited by the IRS for failing to claim the coins, especially at the point of being mined, not just the point of being spent for upgraded mining equipment. I know of at least 1 inept guy that thinks he doesn't have to claim anything for purchasing a new rig during the fall from 1200 to 800. This guy actually thought he purchased the rig for free since he used "mined coins" 
Being a bitcoin miner is a bigger red flag than being a tea party organization in the Obama era.
@_date: 2016-02-15 14:07:29
Centrally controlled, as in bitcoin developers looking at splitting? This whole argument for bitcoin is so self serving. Everyone states its for the good of man, but all I see are dollar signs in the eyes of the believers, having the hopes of a huge payoff someday in the future. It's about mostly bag holders now in the hope and hold mode.
@_date: 2016-02-05 07:45:54
For this idiot, trust is not the central issue. It's transactional costs, and "adapting to change or die."

On Bloomberg Radio they're reporting that Bitcoin once valued at $19,000 has lost most of its value. They didn't even State what the value was it this time just saying that it wiped out most of its value. Too funny.

Price action on cryptos was a leading Indicator for the broader markets. Bitcoin is not a safe haven, but a spec vehicle. Until the markets turn around, Bitcoin will be bearish. Once she turns bullish, that's when the bottom for the broader markets are near.

You knew that end of bear cycle was close when everyone was proclaiming the price to go to zero. 
Also knew it's only going to be a dead cat bounce when the pendulum swing th same way, and people now stating it's going to 50k-100k in 2018.
I need it to pull back a lot more if I want to add what I want.

@_date: 2017-06-12 18:14:20
Exactly. All institutions will create their own blockchain rather than adopt Bitcoin. 
A know someone that was a bagholder of Bitcoin for the past few years(and very vocal all the way down how Bitcoin was the future), and he was silent all the way up this past move until it hit $3k. That tells me that he was shaken out a long time ago, and has just recently gotten back in. That folks, is the top.

This POS bubble popped. Its going to be along grinding pain for multiple years. This POS is dead money. Best entry point is buying on the break of all time highs. Right now, there is plenty of overhead resistance to be worked through.
