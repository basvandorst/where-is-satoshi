I don't think they'd ever got Bitcoin support outside the US anyways. 
When I was looking into this for a project last year it was still unavailable unless you had a US bank account.

I meant more as a comparison to see how Crypto changes financial crashes... even bitcoin was but a twinkle in Satoshi's eye in 2007

You're well within your rights to write 'your', if you think you're right to write it.

"Convector-miner - a heater that produces cryptocurrency. It looks and warms like a battery, absolutely Quiet and earns more than 500 hryvnias net monthly, taking into account the cost of electricity."  
so that's about $21 / £16 a month

I agree, let's cut bank developers some slack. All whilst trying to maintain bank-grade security against the worlds best hackers.

What about the Bitcoin C(R)ash... $3000 to $1800 after a few weeks of Fud.

hmmm... is the conglomerate accepting bitcoin, or a store that sells Samsung products? I'm suspicious, here's a tldr of the article;  
1. Samsung (it makes a good effort to persuade you that this is a big, growing company... which we already knew :D ) are doing something with their own blockchain.
2. In 3 baltic states, you could buy a Samsung product with bitcoin.

Bet that's stressed the devs
