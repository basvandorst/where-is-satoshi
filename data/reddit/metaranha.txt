All I know is that I'd be honored to get donations via bitcoin for the history podcast I run. I even have a donation link on my website, and I plan on sharing bitcoin donation information with the rest of the history podcaster community.

From what I've seen of him, he acts like the kind of guy who is really into taking handouts.

My podcast can be found here: [geekedonhistory.com](
The history podcaster community at large is made up of original content creators who work really hard to produce new content on a weekly/bi-weekly basis and by and large get absolutely nothing out of the arrangement apart from the good feeling of producing quality content for others to enjoy. 
Most of us are humble researchers not seeking fame or fortune, but have a passion for making history fun and entertaining for everyone free-of-charge. Our expenses aren't high - usually some server space and yearly domain registration, but any amount to help cover distribution costs is always welcome!
Even if this fine community doesn't see fit to donate to my podcast, hopefully you all will consider spreading some love around to other history podcasters. They're a great community of people who don't often get much in return for all of their hard work.

We had some discussion in a thread yesterday on this, and it was suggested I come over here to bring some attention to a niche effort to grow the use of bitcoin in small communities.
I'm the host of a podcast covering history topics called [Geeked on History]( Geeked on History is an original content podcast written and hosted by me, and edited by another bitcoin enthusiast: The podcasting community by and large has not yet jumped on the bitcoin train, but it is my hope to get bitcoin donations similar to the one I host on my site posted to all of the humble podcasts in our community. 
Not only do I have a passion for reading/talking about historic topics, but I also have great interest in the future of bitcoin as a currency...not as an investment platform. It is my hope that by getting individuals on board one-at-a-time, we can take the benefits of bitcoin to wide acceptance. If I can even convince a few of the fellow history nerds who I cavort with in this podcasting effort to take an interest in BTC, I'd consider it a victory against Luddites everywhere!
Geeked on history is a completely free podcast. We don't charge our listeners for anything, and we don't run ads. So if you're looking for a place to throw a little extra change, and you'd like to support a small podcast run by two bitcoin enthusiasts, we'd be humbled by a donation!

Not everyone is a troll... Some people genuinely look for things to criticize other people on and don't have the sense to put together a coherent indictment. That doesn't make them a troll, that makes them not-to-bright.

Are you actually trying to draw conclusions about what I think about the US economic system based on my feelings about internet moderation? I'll assume you're not really trying to do something so silly as that.

You'd feel very differently if you had to deal with people who refuse to follow any form of rules, then flout your legitimate visible ban by creating a new account and continuing their 'hilarious' behavior.

If I don't get called a bitch before I'm told anything of substance, I refuse to believe it.

right...he wouldn't be arguing for access at all if he believed that civilians shouldn't even have it in the first place. But if everyone here wants to continue circlejerking about fake news, who am I to say they're wrong?
@_date: 2015-08-10 15:21:58
Guys, the context is totally different. This article makes it sound like he's saying that nobody should have the right to protect their information from anybody. What he actually said was that the government should have the right to decrypt. These are very different concepts. 
If you want to be angry about him saying the government should have decrypt capability, then you have a reason to do that. If you want to be angry because he said what this article is telling you, then you're complaining about something that didn't happen. 
@_date: 2015-08-10 11:01:46
Good lord, thank you for saying this. 
Comey DOES want to be able to decrypt anything the FBI wants to see at will, but he never said anything about civilians not being able to encrypt personal data wholesale. 
@_date: 2015-04-18 16:13:51
I have no idea what your angle is.
@_date: 2015-04-18 14:23:18
I'm not sure what you mean. Bitcoin is meant to be decentralized. If you have a central city claiming to be the "hub" of bitcoin, what exactly does that entail?
@_date: 2015-04-18 12:41:32
"bitcoin hub" sounds really counterintuitive.

Supersize me was a bit overdramatic for my taste. IIRC, he admitted that he was eating vegan while his girlfriend was and had been for some time. 
Then suddenly he goes out and eats a big mac and fries and surprise, surprise, he throws up. Yeah, that's going to happen when you don't eat dairy or meat for years and suddenly inundate your system with the shittiest forms of meat and dairy you possibly can. It was striking imagery, but not entirely honest when you imply that it's flat out McDonalds food causing you to vomit and not the fact that your body hasn't digested those food groups in a couple years time.
