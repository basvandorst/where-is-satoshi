Nothing wrong with selling and putting it into something that brings happiness, but there is a decent chance that bitcoin could be worth much more in the medium  term. It's worth her asking herself how she would feel in her new kitchen if it goes to $50k or $100k or more. Would she struggle with regret or be fine with her decision. Interest rates are low right now. She could likely take a cash out refinance and get her kitchen without increasing her mortgage payments. Just worth examining all options.

So, I just got this letter today. I only had sales in 2017, and I reported everything, including numerous alt exchanges. I just went to Coinbase and to their 'Tax Center' and downloaded everything available. Upon review and comparison of the full transaction history with the 'Gain/Loss calculator, it is clear that the Gain/Loss calculator is counting any Sent txn the same as an actual Sell txn. Now obviously, a send could be to another exchange for the purpose of selling or trading, or a send could be payment for something, all technically taxable events. However, a lot of my sends were just sending Hodl currency to my personal wallets. WTF? I'm guessing CB is just complying with explicit IRS instruction, but I'm not sure what to do with that. Are they going to be coming after us? Do we need to document what every send was for? Hell, I sent plenty through tumblers before sending to gambling sites (I legit lost consistently, so no unreported winnings to worry about); I'm not looking forward to having to figure out what went where.  I feel like just ignoring this, but I also ain't trying to deal with an audit. I may be better off doing my own forensics and submitting explanation for the sends. Ugh. Fucking tax motherfuckers with money and leave my broke ass alone already.

The KYC requirements are not yet explicitly defined wrt cryptocurrency, so it is not certain that CB is overcomplying. I have had my bank ask me such questions about cash deposits. Bitcoin being most analogous to cash, that is the response you are going to see. Most people are not depositing large amounts of unexplained cash into their bank, so they don't deal with these types of questions. 
@_date: 2015-12-19 16:46:26
Because the source was a bank or credit card that already had to follow KYC, so those funds were automatically clean. If you had bought all your bitcoin from CB using your bank account, they would have the same assurance that the source of the funds had already been cleared. However, moving bitcoin from elsewhere to CB would trip a flag in the same way that depositing large amounts of cash in your bank would.

I see that this was posted sarcastically, but I'll take the opportunity to point this out anyway. Other than having virtually no information beyond 'send money, buy island' there is a perhaps even bigger problem. Even if this were a much better documented and presented proposal, anyone with enough xbt to really contribute obviously believes bitcoin is a good investment, probably a much better one than island real estate.

I personally use Electrum and Mycellium, but I have a lot of faith in Coinbase, and I recommend them to new users. I just got an email today about a new long term secure storage they offer (free, of course). 
EDIT: I just found out about this: 
What the actual fuck? I had no idea that could be done. So, it looks like, for long term storage, your own cold wallet is the way to go. A bit more info on what I do: I create my cold wallet in electrum and send my funds to a few different addresses within the wallet (after tumbling, just for kicks). I print pdfs of the cold wallet and encrypt them with pgp (to be decrypted by either me, my wife, or my brother in law beneficiary), and I store them in various cloud storage places online. Creating the cold wallet on a machine that has never been connected to the net is a great additional precaution, but I don't have enough bitcoin to justify getting a machine for that. I also think an encrypted "paper" wallet is as secure as an actual physical paper in a safe deposit box, but that too is a very secure method.
If you are looking for a hot wallet, I like mycellium, and you should still keep a backup of your keys, similar to what I described above, just in case, but, for an active wallet, I would still recommend Coinbase.

Ya'know, you're right. That did come off as cultish. To be clear, first, I'm in the camp that thinks it will be a different crypto that ends up being the dominant one, but I am convinced that ultimately cryptocurrency will eclipse other forms of money. Second, when I said 'most', that was really more about my own personal experience. All those I know that have learned about it have ended up getting involved. Likewise, because of the rather steep learning curve, I think most that overcome the barrier to entry are already the sort of people that are pre-disposed to liking it.
But, you are correct. I neglected to mention any of the valid reasons that some knowledgeable people stay away. Among them are the volatility, lack of adoption, energy intensive mining, lack or or difficult security. There are truly plenty of legitimate reasons.

My hope is that we might get more guidance closer to April. Back when we were able to log in, I took screenshots of everything. However, in my case, as with many others, most of my holdings we in BitcoinBuilder. I trust him to distribute equitably whatever he can recover though.
EDIT: Since I was thinking about it, I went to [bitcoinbuilder]( to see if there was any new info there. He mentions that the process for submitting an official claim has yet to be revealed.
@_date: 2014-05-04 15:17:32
It is possible for an unconfirmed txn to get held up on a node. In a situation like that, it could take hours, but that is a rare occurrence. A ten minute wait sounds like a merchant was waiting for a confirmation, which isn't really feasible, as that does take about 10 minutes.
Yes, there is an element of risk for merchants. Unlike with credit cards, for which all the risk is assumed by the issuer, the merchant bears the risk with bitcoin (unless something akin to banks come along and start to guarantee txns, which undermines the whole Bitcoin idea of a trustless system). 
I personally don't think Bitcoin is the right cryptocurrency for daily transactions, but I do believe cryptocurrency is far superior to existing methods of commerce.

Don't be sorry. I use Tor. I generally trust its security. I was just making the point that very little is ever foolproof. There are other things that I didn't mention, largely because they depend on IRL action or user mistakes--gaining physical access to your hardware, or hitting you with a javascript exploit, the all powerful keylogger, what have you.

I think so too, particularly in the last few weeks. Still, actually trading on your own exchange, while perhaps unethical and possibly illegal, does not change the fact that they were a real exchange. It just means they were among those trading on the exchange. The only thing that would make them not a real exchange is if they were faking the order books and just buying and selling at the price points they chose.

Not true. The exchange has volume. The price is directly relevant to me and others who are trading on bitcoinbuilder. They are still the oldest exchange. Mark hasn't been kicked off the Bitcoin Foundation yet. They have a lot of bitcoin in their wallets. Their clients have a lot of bitcoin stored there. The immediate future of Gox is of indisputable importance to the current state of Bitcoin, and the resolution of their current moratorium on withdrawals is affecting very large numbers of bitcoin holders to the tune of many millions of dollars. 
As for not directing newbs to sign up for Gox--anyone just getting involved in Bitcoin that takes even 10 minutes to google it should be amply warned. I don't care how new you are. If you end up on Gox, you deserve whatever happens. Anyway, that point is practically moot, as no one is getting verified or getting fiat into there anyway.

On the other hand, I think the risk that it will never be possible to get xbt out of Gox is relatively slim, so, if I can use a third party site to exchange market priced xbt for cheaper Gox xbt and withdraw it all as soon as Gox reenables xbt withdrawal, why wouldn't I? I'm not advocating 'trusting' Gox as an exchange; I think they should die a painful death for their gross inadequacy. They should be the most stable, profitable, and most used exchange, but they instead chose to exemplify epic failure. I just want to take advantage of their demise to multiply my holdings.
@_date: 2014-03-02 20:00:53


Actually, security measures that can be made open source, along with public checks and balances, are the best security. See PGP, Bitcoin. In reality, only a fool trusts security on the word of a stranger.


I don't choose my products on branding, but a terrible brand will make me *not* choose a product, particularly when there are so many others to choose from. I wouldn't open an account with Goofy &amp; Daffy Savings &amp; Loan, because the choice of a name says something about the people running it. My money is not a fucking joke, and anyone that brands their financial service in joke form undermines the trust that they take your money and its security seriously, particularly when the security measures are secret and not open to independent validation. 
If an exchange was called Integrity Partners or something, that would not make me trust it, but it at least would not undermine the building of trust based on other factors.
Your name is your first impression. Branding does matter. You guys just showed up to the grown up table in a clown suit. How does that not undermine your mission? How do you plan to be taken seriously? Dogecoin *has* had remarkable growth, and the infrastructure is impressive, but it did start as an admitted joke and organically became something more, because people are silly. That's awesome. I like Doge, the meme and the coin. However, you can't compare yourselves to Dogecoin, because you are entering the market billing yourselves not as simply a serious exchange but as the most secure (without anything to really back that up), so you are not intending to start as a joke, yet you have decided to go with a cute jokey name. And the real money will decide to go with a different exchange.

I converted all my holdings to Gox xbt on bitcoinbuilder, most of them at around 2:1. I knew I was taking a big risk when I did it. I'm not counting it a total loss until we know more, but I am prepared for it to all be gone. I gambled but not with more than I could afford to lose. Am I an idiot? Quite possibly. Feel free to call me one; I ain't killing myself (or even losing sleep) over my bets. That's why you size your positions according to your tolerance for risk and what you can afford to lose. 
That said, don't be assholes to the people, foolish or not, that did lose a lot more than they can afford. Lives (not mine) have been ruined, and while those people did make mistakes and bear some responsibility, they are already suffering enough without being bullied on this sub.

This. Incompetence, when admitted and apologized for, can be forgiven. 
Karpeles has demonstrated not only gross incompetence as both a coder and an administrator, but he has, in my opinion more importantly, shown a complete lack of integrity in blaming the Bitcoin devs for what is obviously his own fault. I went a bit over the line in another thread with some violent imagery, but, suffice to say, I have zero respect for a CEO who acts like a drunk wife-beater on an episode of COPS when it comes to taking some damn responsibility.

That would be great, assuming Gox's insolvency, which is currently only speculation. However, what would the acquiring exchange really gain? If Gox folds, customers will go elsewhere anyway. If they bought Gox out and kept the Gox exchange operating, they would only taint themselves with the now ruined reputation of Gox. If Gox is insolvent, all they really get is bad debt. 
The only possible thing that Gox could offer to a buyer is a presence in Japan. I have no idea how valuable that really is.

No, it isn't. It's money...or a commodity...or a security, but it isn't speech. You may be thinking of the idea of 'money as speech' set out in the Citizen's United decision, but that didn't mean that money itself is speech but that the donating or spending of money to express a view or support of a political candidate is a form of speech. That form of 'speech' isn't curtailed by restricting the form such expenditure may take.

What? Like your post title of 'PROOF'? Look, it isn't a bad theory. You post some supporting data, but this is miles and miles away from anything approaching proof. Even if this is true, the US Gov has not necessarily stolen, only frozen. Now I still don't believe, again if that is true, that the US Gov has or should have such authority, but, if this is the US Gov, that scenario gives the best shot at full recovery of lost assets. I hope you are right, but tone it down. This is still just your speculation and nothing more.

1) Has nothing to do with IRS classification
2) Very possible that Gox losses could be covered; however policy limits and deductible might not make it worthwhile. For instance, if your house were broken into and you had jewelry, cash, tools, TV, and bearer bonds stolen, the total value would far exceed most deductibles, but policy limits would not necessarily pay the full amount for each category of loss. If all that was stolen was $5k worth of jewelry, and you are only covered up to $1k for jewelry losses, with a $1200 deductible...well, you see what I'm getting at.

Third, since shipping cost varies with weight/size, and a percent discount is relative to your gross revenue for a sale, I would say you are better off with a discount. Besides, if you don't immediately convert all xbt sales to fiat currency, you may often quickly get that back if the value increases. I've always felt that offering free shipping for orders over *x* amount was a great way to increase sales.

Yeah, I can dig that. Perhaps metaphors are not really up to the task here. I guess my point is that, while I too want to see Gox gone, many of us have an interest in seeing them first honor their obligation to account holders. I first got into bitcoin during the hype surrounding the April crash. I wasn't able to get in then, due to the long backlog of verification at Gox. By the time it did go through, I was already trading on other exchanges. I have never traded there, but I have bough Gox coins since this shit started, betting that they would enable withdrawals again, and I would be able to get my cheap coin out. I also know others who were able to arb effectively with Japanese help or through other means. Regardless, not everyone with holdings tied up on Gox is some naive idiot who deserves whatever they get. Gox has had no end of issues, but they are the oldest exchange and have always (eventually) honored clients withdrawals, certainly of bitcoin.

In the case of credit card fraud, I'm pretty sure most credit card companies absorb the loss when they remove the charges from the cardholder's bill. I don't think they can completely reverse the payment, taking away the merchant's money. The risk is, I'm sure, figured into the processing fees and interest fees that are all charged, in the same way the shoplifting losses affect the price of goods, but my point is still that the merchant isn't at risk of not being paid when accepting a card. A quick check of the Wikipedia entry for credit card fraud appears to confirm that, so long as all the proper procedures for CC acceptance were followed by the merchant, the financial institution bears the responsibility in cases of fraud.

You assume the theory involving them buying cheap coin, whether or not they deliberately engineered the crash, is with the intention of running, which they would have to do if they simply stole all the coin. However, if they are buying coin, then they are not stealing from their customers, though they may be acquiring in order to cover the inevitable exodus when and if withdrawals are reenabled. Simultaneously, they could be arbing to make fiat to likewise cover their fiat obligations. Assuming they have no solvency issues at all, and all that talk is just FUD, they could still be buying and arbing just for profit. Regardless, it is a lot safer than stealing, and, since it is bitcoin and a legal grey area, it isn't even necessarily illegal.

Again, the image you present is material to your success or failure. I was actually taking my time to try and offer some perspective on how potential customers might be turned off by your name. If I used strong language, it was not to demean or offend but rather to make the point that, in the business of finance, the appearance of not taking things seriously, is offensive, because there are serious consequences in this business. 
I won't offer any insincere apology at any offense I inadvertently caused with genuine feedback, nor do I take any offense at your reaction. I only, again, make the point that such a reaction in a public forum is bad for your business.

Certainly the effect of declaring anything with bankruptcy in the name is suicidal; however, I feel like the PR nightmare was already in full effect before the filing. Witness the basement price of bitcoin on Gox since the halting of withdrawals. I think the reputation was already trashed, and, if protection allowed them to pursue recovery of the missing bitcoin rather than focusing on the lawsuits piling up in multiple countries, it was likely the right move.

First of all, just to educate, not putting you down or anything, but Bitcoin (no cap C) is the way to refer to the Bitcoin network or protocol. Lowercase bitcoin refers to the currency. Additionally, while you most often see the currency code BTC, I (and others) use XBT because it conforms to the ISO standard for non-national currency codes (USD vs XAU (Gold)).
To your specific questions, xbt users have both a vested interest in Bitcoin's success (most of them own bitcoin) in addition to really liking the concept (hence their involvement to begin with). 


Most people who aren't involved have a lack of understanding of the concepts. Some with a good understanding are less favorable towards Bitcoin while acknowledging that cryptocurrency is the future of money. Again, not to be snarky, but, while you say you have read about Bitcoin, your questions belie some fundamental misunderstandings.
For instance:


Bitcoin is already both. Your bitcoin is stored in an address that is nothing more than a public/private key pair. I have bitcoin in online wallets, mostly on Coinbase, and I have more in cold storage. The cold stored bitcoin address keys are in a pdf file. I have an encrypted copy on Google Drive. I have an encrypted copy on a flash drive, securely stored. Finally, I have a paper copy stashed. With any one of those copies of the key pair I can access my bitcoin. Keeping only a single copy or keeping your whole stash online is poor security.
I hope that helps answer your questions. Keep reading. I work in electronics and software, and it took me a couple weeks of studying to wrap my head around Bitcoin. It is a totally new concept.
I put together [this doc]( a while back with a lot of good links to better references and stuff.

Not exactly. The credit card transactions still take much longer to clear than a bitcoin txn. The difference is that merchants only wait for the credit card approval, whereas many accepting bitcoin require multiple confirmations. Most merchants who accept bitcoin at a POS only wait to see the unconfirmed txn hit the blockchain.

It was a real exchange in the sense that it had actual volume and trades being executed. It had both fiat and xbt going into it. It could be holding fiat or xbt on its balance sheet, and that wouldn't affect it being a real exchange. An exchange is just a market where other buyers and sellers come together. The exchange is not buying and selling that which is being traded itself.

AWS is a known quantity when it comes to their basic security practices. Running one's own servers is only as good as whomever implements and maintains the system. Furthermore, and maybe someone who knows AWS better than I can chime in, but would AWS not bear some or all of the liability in the event of an attack that resulted in theft? That, to me, would be more important even than hypothetical potential superiority of security, since all I really give a damn about at the end of the day is 'bitch, got my money.'

risk =/= expense
Even wrt risk though, I disagree that the seller has a disproportionate share. The buyer has just as much to worry about in bringing cash to the deal. Seller has to worry about counterfeit money (easy enough to check for that) and getting robbed after the deal is done (same as buyer has to worry about getting robbed prior to the deal). Precautions like using public places and not walking home from the deal or whatever can easily mitigate the risk of robbery. Compared to hooking, localbitcoins is very low risk.

I find my life to be better without drugs these days, but, while not all of my use was positive by a long shot, I feel I owe a lot of personal development to psychedelic experiences.

@_date: 2018-04-20 14:12:10
Readily. My past is so robust with fuck ups, most of which had no personal development upside, many which can never be fully recovered from. There are no excuses. There is no getting back the wasted time. There is no fixing some of the things that were broken.
All that said, if I could go back and fix it all, I do not have regrets about a number of the experiences I had with psychedelic drugs. The failure to distinguish between types of drugs and types of use leads to the 'D.A.R.E. effect'. Telling people that drugs are universally bad is easily falsified by a little experimentation, after which the credibility of cautionary advice is lost, rending drug education ineffective.

If people are assigned a single address that is the only legal means to send or receive money, it becomes very simple to blacklist any given address, basically declaring funds from a given source illegal. It can likewise be made illegal to send funds to a given receiver. This allows for near elimination of black markets. It will no longer be possible to conduct illicit trade in fungible currency. 
It's not a matter of if but when. The blockchain offers not only control and transparency over commerce, ones assigned address can serve as ID and signature, basically a secure digital social security number. 
The utility of cryptocurrency for unprecedented government control is so obvious, it constantly baffles me how oblivious the fanboys remain.
@_date: 2017-06-22 14:00:04

I don't feel like they have to get out front of anything. Right now, even the biggest cryptos are still just speculative investments; their value is nothing independent of fiat exchange rates. I agree about your GovCoin though. However, once they drop their own crypto and declare it the only valid currency, everything else could be made worthless by degree basically. If you can't convert currency to a means of buying and selling, it is worthless.
Now the black market could establish its own standard crypto that is only used for black market trading. Just as all currency is simply a stand-in for some real good or service of value, basically introducing fungibility to barter trade, so would a black market crypto act as a barter lubricant. Instead of trading cocaine for sex, you just use a crypto that can be exchanged within the underground economy. The fact that it would be extremely difficult and risky to convert it to the legal GovCoin would no doubt have a shrinking effect on the underground economy though.

It's very different than the current practice of laundering money that was received in the form of anonymous cash. Under these circumstances you have to launder both sides of the transaction at the time the transaction itself is being made. The laundered transaction is the illegal transaction; it's not more difficult but much riskier, and the risk is shared by all parties to the illicit activity.

The government accepting bitcoin but only if it is validated and/or requiring merchants to do likewise is a possibility, in fact it is *the* possibility that has everyone shook, particularly the regulating of merchants to disallow them from accepting non-validated coin.
However, that ain't what you said. You said "redeem CoinValidation-validated Bitcoins for $x apiece," and "backed by the guvmint," which is a most unlikely scenario, while the one you described in your second comment is much closer to the threat posed by CoinValidation.

WRT the speed of the network/confirmation, it counts as slow when vendors require multiple confirmations. Agreed, my single anecdote is not data, but there are plenty of others out there. The 7 tx/s limit and the blocksize limit have valid reasons, but they also pose real limitations, as do the energy demands of mining. I have seen the energy consumption dismissed in this sub, but I have never seen it really explained as not a concern. It has been favorably compared to the energy cost of dealing with tradition currency, in terms of the processing of txns and the manufacturing process to mint new currency and deal with retired bills, but when it is still far more energy intensive than similar cryptographic alternatives, it is dismissively expedient to compare it to what we all agree is a soon-to--be obsolete form of money.
As for having two different design goals...kinda, but not at the foundation level. All money is designed with the same basic aim, and all transacting systems are designed to transmit money. If one is designed with the goal of being more robust in its ability to do so, well, that makes it better, imo.
On a related, genuine note, while I'm sure I could eventually find it, I'd appreciate any link to dev discussion of the block size/txn/s limits, and these other issues that many are voicing concern around. I use GitHub for work, but I hadn't been able to find much discussion in the repo for bitcoin. As I said, I'm sure I can Google that all for myself, but I might not find a good source that someone in here knows of.

First, you're largely correct in that it would be much more difficult for a single government to institute this system, it would be much easier the more global the control was to be exerted by treaty. 
The second case is much easier to prevent though. The whole idea is that only sanctioned addresses can send and receive, so the government knows how much each entity received and spent. This makes it much easier to identify illegal activity, and it makes it much riskier. Imagine if, as a drug dealer, you could only get paid by credit card. Likewise, as a consumer of illegal goods or services, your anonymity is severely compromised. All it takes is one break to tie one buyer or seller to the activity, and pretty simple forensics can identify the other customers and the entire supply chain.
Even without global implementation, the same toolset described above makes controlling currency exchange feasible. Illegal currency exchange is just like any other black market activity. They only way to exchange unauthorized goods, including other currency, for the sanctioned currency is between two addresses that are the opposite of anonymous, so it demands a fraudulent commodity of some kind. For example, Bob sells burgers, but the burgers are really opium or black market crypto or guns or whatever, as soon as one customer gets busted, so does Bob and every one who's every bought a burger from him.

Not exactly. It isn't mined at all, rather it was all created at the system's inception and is being slowly distributed. xrp doesn't involve any proof of work for its security. It instead uses a proof of stake/consensus model. Like bitcoin or USD, the value of a currency has little to do with mining or anything other than the value people place on it.
Don't conflate Ripple the network/protocol with its native currency xrp. While xrp is needed to make the system function, the idea is that any unit of value can be sent between Ripple wallets using the network.

That's a little harsh, man. This isn't cancer research, it's currency. I believe in it hardcore for the long term, but there isn't anything wrong with responding to the market. If you don't care about money, then what are you doing getting involved in bitcoin?
EDIT: The thing is, I agree with all of you who responded to my comment. I too believe strongly in the potential of a global decentralized currency, for all the reasons you have all stated, and more. 
And yes, currency pays for cancer research, among many other worthy causes, and those that make money are able to donate to further those causes. Many of those who don't care about making money are never able to contribute meaningfully to the things they profess to care about. 
Speculation isn't hurting Bitcoin, it is raising its profile, providing liquidity, testing the regulatory environment, and, I think it worth saying twice, raising its profile. You cannot build a global currency out of something no one has ever heard of. In the past, currency was created on the basis of the most universal, stable, and easily exchanged commodity. Now, we have the technology to approach it from the other end, by designing something completely new to be the best possible medium of exchange. But, because this revolutionary tool of commerce was designed from scratch, it lacks the other essential qualities of a currency. It can only achieve stability and universal acceptance once it is globally known and universally desired &amp; trusted, and that path is paved not by libertarian idealists alone. I share your ideals, but we will not realize them without the rest of the world, and the path to the rest of the world is through speculators and investors and gamblers who are in this to make Money. For my part, I take mild offense at the notion that I can't be both, that my buying *and selling* of bitcoin is somehow not a valid or useful contribution to the development of the Bitcoin ecosystem. 
I absolutely will buy back in, because I believe in this thing, and I absolutely think that the price will exceed its recent highs, but that is no reason not to get out and take profits if I believe it is going down far enough that I can buy back in below my previous basis. Oh, and yeah, that 10 bitcoin I've sold today? Somebody bought that and is now involved or further involved in Bitcoin, because there was someone to sell coin on the other side of the order book.

Like you bought bitcoin? That was because the money from your bank account takes time to clear. It has virtually nothing to do with the time it takes to credit you with btc once they have confirmed receipt of your fiat. BTW, Coinbase instant buy is awesome. I recommend jumping through their hoops to get fully verified in order to achieve the privilege of being able to buy coin faster than any other exchange method.
@_date: 2017-06-22 14:52:05
I think it's more likely that government/central bank will develop their own crypto and mandate it to be the only legal tender. The only reason it isn't currently possible for government to make bitcoin or other crypto illegal and worthless is the existence of cash. Hard cash is impossible to completely monitor, so there will always be a way to exchange crypto for fiat. If cash is replaced by fiat crypto, that ends and any unsanctioned currency becomes worthless or at least only of use and value in the underground economy, which, granted, could become much more significant in the face of government stranglehold on commerce.

Bitcoin is not a great transaction network. Once coins are all mined it will likely fall into almost complete disuse. It will be big enough that, while difficulty plummets, some miners will remain to collect the few transaction fees on the movement of, by then, very high value coins.
But bitcoin will be much more like gold (value store) than a medium of exchange. I believe pretty strongly (downvote now) that Ripple will be the dominant transaction network, and xrp the dominant global exchange medium. I think it will be at least 3-5yrs before we get close to that reality. IN that time xrp will be too volatile as we move through the early adopter phase. 
Until we have a cryptocurrency with relatively stable value and a transaction network that is virtually instant, energy efficient, and secure we will not see any serious usage of cryptocurrency for buying and selling.

I gotten in on every xrp giveaway since the first distribution. I just got a couple thousand more for being active on GitHub. I'm now sitting on about 8200, none of which I paid for. If my memory is correct, they started out at about $0.0002 and are now around $0.09.
I'm pretty happy with my 45000% return on free money...shit, now that I've done the math, I wish I had put some actually money in it. Damn.
As to why? Hard to say. There's a lot of money behind it. The creators are still holding onto an 80% stake, so they have a significant interest in promoting it. It has some advantages over btc in terms of widespread adoption potential.
I'm a big fan of btc. I like it a lot better than ripple, but I could see ripple being a parallel success. Here's hoping.
@_date: 2013-12-01 07:00:31
Any correction is going to be slight unless there is actual bad news for bitcoin (mining capacity outpaced by txn volume), because there are legions just waiting for a little dip to buy in hard. As soon as we see a 10% drop, the bids roll in, and the market responds by moving up more. Sit tight, everyone. The crash may come, but this isn't it. The crash will happen for an actual reason, not just because it got too high.

I too missed it until someone showed me. Yeah, the y axis is basically broken since the max is currently 1Mb, and all points are thus less than that. It appears unable to show decimals or something. Downloading the csv data, I can see the highest block avg at 0.3. I got that looking at raw data points, instead of the 7 day average. You can switch with the links at the bottom, but even the raw points are just daily averages, not individual blocks. The 0.3 was from 11/19, and I thought we had seen a bigger day since then.

It's not a roll back. It's an extra layer of technology. It's a simple variation on colored coins. It's much easier to do as my earlier reply suggests though, and create a new crypto for which only the government can create and issue addresses. Makes it cake to monitor, freeze, or blacklist any address/entity. I'm not really clear on what you mean by archaic or simplistic, since it's neither of those in any way I can see.

I agree completely with the point that you're making. However, services that handle that sort of thing will, imo, precede mass adoption. Major players will enter the game of ewallets, with not only tight security but some sort of depositor guarantee, similar to what a customer enjoys with their bank. Transacting is already relatively simple to learn, but I envision that also becoming a lot easier. (For my part, I think Ripple will become the dominant means of transacting all units of value, including btc, which I don't see going away or losing value as a result of Ripple's rise, quite the contrary).

I've been ITT joking about how I wouldn't have given it back. Seriously though, the coin may have come out of another's balance, but these losses are all on cryptsy. It's a really unforgivable coding error on their part, and, if they fail to make it right for everyone whose balance is low, they should and will be done for as an exchange. I wouldn't have returned it and I wouldn't have felt bad.
SnapSwap actually screwed up recently and gave away too many ripples to me in a promotion. They double and tripled up on rewards for deposits I made. They emailed me and asked for it back. I told them I was sorry for their loss, but I couldn't do that. That's irreversible transaction networks, folks. When you fuck up and lose your private key or mistakenly copy the send receiving address or whatever, you just burnt money, and it ain't coming back.

I'm guessing you don't have instant buy? Are you sure you got no fees? If you see a price for your transaction then I'm guessing you are locked at that price and made a normal buy, possible the notice popped back up after you made the purchase. You are forced to check a box acknowledging that you may get coins at a different price in order to buy, if that order is in effect. 
Your best bet regardless is to put in a support ticket with Coinbase. They may take awhile to respond with the volume they are dealing with, but they're the only ones who can sort you out.

I think it's the combination of the barrier to understanding of the technology behind it and the somewhat arrogant assumption of guys from the finance world that they should be able to understand easily any worthwhile financial instrument, so, if they can't grasp it quickly, it must be hopeless, because it's doomed to only be understood by a tech savvy few. They fail to understand: 1) despite knowledge of finance, they have no idea how dismal their knowledge of tech is, and 2) once market saturation is achieved, understanding the underlying tech will be irrelevant, because, like an iPhone, everyone will just trust that it works, and that will be enough.

If you want to mine for fun and learning, you can mess with some of the other cryptocurrencies that are easier to mine. Mining bitcoin at this point takes serious power and a pretty sizable investment in hardware capable of producing a return. You should expect to invest at least 4 grand in hardware that is brand new, built by relatively new company, and in high demand (think unpredictable performance and overtaxed customer service, and that's the best ones). 
The people I know that are still profitably mining are connected enough to get the latest rigs early, mine with them, and then flip them on ebay for additional profit. These guys are also professional programmers with significant hardware experience to deal with any issues that may crop up (and they do) with the mining rigs.
If you just want to make money, invest the cost of a mining rig directly in bitcoin. Profit. Mining is expensive in many different ways. I know it looks like a path to 'free' money, but that is far from the reality now. Ah...2009.

Idea for those looking to accept btc for goods or services:
What about offering your product at a deep discount when compared with the current fiat equivalent? Most businesses that I see are keeping their btc prices in step with the fiat value, which ignores the likelihood that fiat will suffer slow inflation, while bitcoin continues its path to the moon. 
Example: btc passed $500 today. If I offered something that I would normally sell for $800 for 1btc, it looks like a great deal, my amount of business increases, I get money and chicks and stuff. This hypothetical assumes your cost on the product sold is less than the going price of a btc; otherwise, you should not sell stuff and just buy btc.

Interest paying banks do not keep enough cash on hand to cover all deposits. That's why a run on a bank causes it to run out of cash. The idea is that enough currency is kept on hand to service withdrawals and the rest of depositor's capital can be put to work. This is how a bank works and why you get paid interest on your deposits.
All that said, just because this purports to operate like a bank it doesn't make it a safe bank/not a scam/ponzi. 
I would love to hear more about the actual individuals behind this and what sort of assurances they are willing and able to provide to convince those of us that aren't fools that this is a safe investment. Not safe in the sense that btc investments are not inherently risky, just safe as in not a complete scam/guaranteed total loss scenario.
Ultimately, the trust of depositors is the reason not to run off with the loot or make horrible investment decisions with it. There is a lot more to be made in the long term as a top ten bank than as a quick scam artist, though the latter may be less work over all.

The more I'm reading now, the more it seems to me that bitcoin will be the internet's gold. xrp will be traded debt, and ripple will be the dominant means of transacting. I think a single btc will always be worth more than a single xrp, because xrp is better kept low enough to serve its transactional function. Still, I think speculative buys of xrp and certainly taking advantage of giveaways is a good idea, as it still has lots of growing room before it settles in. By settling, I mean that I see it reaching a stable relative value, my guess is somewhere between 0.5 to 2 USD. 
I'm still reading a lot at this point. I'd love to hear alternative or contrary perspectives.

I also recommend electrum for pc, mac, or linux. You can also get Mycelium for android. Either will generate new addresses for you to send the coins to, from the poker site. With either you can then export the public and private keys to a printable file, with the keys in both text and qr format. Yes, the only truly secure way to do this is with a computer that will never see the internet, but I myself am not that security conscious. I am reasonable confident in the integrity of my hardware. I export &amp; print and thoroughly delete (don't just leave the file in your recycle bin).
Finally, don't just keep your stash on a piece of paper. You might forget where you put it. It could get wet or burn. I highly recommend encrypting the digital file with something like pgp and storing the encrypted file in the cloud with something like google drive.

At least for those, like me, in the US, we need IRS offical guidance on bitcoin before its use in charitable donations will grow.

The money I will make from holding will enable me to make more charitable gifts in the future. If I give xbt to a charity now, and they convert and spend it, the opportunity cost is just plain waste, and I dislike waste in charities.
But that is just my perspective. However you choose to give to those in need, I applaud your selflessness and generosity. I'm just sharing my thoughts on how I think my gifts will be the most impactful. Cheers to the OP for reminding us all that giving is one of the great joys of having.

Which part? 
I waited over an hour for the first confirmation of a transaction two days ago (with a fee included). Currently, it takes more computational power than the world's 500 fastest supercomputers combined to hash a block. And this is still the early adopter stage. It may be over $1000/xbt, but most people I talk to have not even heard of Bitcoin.
Do you dispute that the Bitcoin network can only transmit bitcoin?

@_date: 2013-12-01 07:33:58
I like Ripple. I like Bitcoin too, but I think Ripple solves Bitcoin's biggest problems, while capitalizing on its greatest innovation--a decentralized crytpographic transaction network. 
The Bitcoin network can only handle bitcoin. Ripple can transmit any kind of value, including bitcoin. 
The bitcoin network is slow, energy inefficient, and fraught with scaleability problems, as the code currently stands. Ripple solves those issues.
Everyone in this sub hates on Ripple for being 'controlled' by Ripple Labs, but Ripple Labs has done and continues to do exactly what they have said they are around to do. They are giving away exactly what they said they were going to. Slowly? Yes, slowly. The point is not to immediately flood the market with xrp but to distribute it in a way that best benefits the network and its adoption. I got some giveaways just for participating in the beta mailing list, for signing up on a gateway, for being a contributor on github, for donating some of my idle computing power to scientific research. I know, evil shit, right? The same haters were crying foul because it wasn't open source like they said it would be, and...then it was open sourced, just as soon as they had a stable version of the code to release for collaborative development, just like they said they were doing.
Many bitcoiners continue to whine that it is essentially centralized, and, in some ways, yes, it is, at this stage, but that too will change with wider adoption. While, with Bitcoin, we see growing consolidation of mining power as the computing power required raises the barrier to entry ever higher. So, Ripple gets less centralized over its growth, while Bitcoin becomes more centralized.
Having a team of well funded people who know their shit behind something like Ripple is a serious asset when it comes to pushing for widespread adoption of a decentralized transaction network. Of course the banks aren't going to just go away because suddenly Bitcoin. Not everyone is going to buy an offline laptop running a Linux live boot to make a secure offline wallet. Normal people want a bank that assures them of the safety of their money and pays interest and offers them credit. No matter what the currency or currencies, fractional reserve banking is going nowhere. 
Wire transfers, on the other hand, have one foot in the grave. With Google Ventures among the VC behind Ripple Labs, I am betting that Google Wallet will be the first major transmitter to begin operating over the Ripple Network. Many others will follow. A rapid rise in the value of XRP will not be disruptive to a currency agnostic txn system, so there won't be the same barrier to using Ripple for conducting commerce. Again, the emphasis of Bitcoin is bitcoin--a new *currency*--when what is truly revolutionary about cryptocurrency is the new way of transmitting value. To restrict that marvel to one currency, new or old, is to miss out on what this innovation portends for the future of money.
Finally, I see Ripple becoming the main means of moving value globally. I am betting that xrp will be the dominant currency of day to day transactions. I am betting also that bitcoin will see 6 figure coin values in my life. It is the original gamechanger. It will be the original money of the new age, and its coolness and originality alone will keep it, like gold, as the coveted store of value, mostly just as that--a store of value. Though, unlike piles of gold, it will still be relatively easy to transact with bitcoin. I might typically by a beer with xrp, but, if I want to buy a house or a company, I could use bitcoin, possibly in combination with many other types of exchangeable value, cause that's the fucking future.

You premine critics sound like bots. Why is it bad for creators to retain a significant interest in their invention's success? It's only a problem for pump &amp; dump schemes, and it's pretty clear that Ripple is going for a lot more than that. For that matter, you don't need to premine to gain significant early interest as a creator. Early miners always get a shit ton of coins at the start. 
That's beside the point though, because ripples aren't mined at all. They are intrinsic to the network and needed for its operation. They were created in total as part of that system, which eliminates the waste of mining.

Why not? Say I contract with you to paint your house for 1 xbt. Upon completion, I submit to you an invoice, including my receiving address (much as a traditional invoice would tell you who to make the check payable to). 


If I dispute that you paid me, I would sue you. The blockchain can show all outputs to the address I provided on the invoice. If you claim you paid me, then you should be able to identify the address you paid me from, and prove you own it (send a small transaction to demonstrate you have the private key). Failure to demonstrate that you had paid me would put you in breach of contract. Here's where it gets funny, to sue for damages in a US court, the damages would have to be in dollars. You could argue that you refused to pay the 1 xbt because the value had changed drastically since the original agreement. The judge could then order you to pay me dollar value at present time, job completion, or contract origination. He could even make you give me a bitcoin. While you can't sue for damages in bitcoin, a judge can pretty much do whatever the hell he wants.
EDIT: IANAL (or a judge)

Right, but there is a critical distinction between something being 'part of a transaction' and something being used to transact. Buying/selling side is more than semantics because the soda I just bought cannot be exchanged next door for a newspaper, nor could anyone make change for a soda in, say, M&amp;Ms. I can hypothetically barter with anything, but in our economy, most things one buys are not accepted as money by the vast majority of sellers. Only the buying side is accomplished with the same medium of exchange regardless of the seller (based on the dominant currency of the location and with the odd exception). 
If you did purchase silver, or anything for that matter, with gold as your payment, then you did participate in one of the now relatively rare transactions using gold as money.

Yeah. That's why I don't do online. I use instant buy on Coinbase to get coins as soon as I get a trade request (I don't hold any stock), so online would require me to buy coins before I had a buyer.

I considered selling at $1100, but my avg basis is below $500. I don't see it bottoming that low, so any sell would be a losing proposition for me. I don't think we will see a real crash without a serious change in the perception of Bitcoin, like that the network is not able to handle the growing volume of txns. That, in fact, is my primary topic of research right now.
@_date: 2013-11-17 23:12:37
No it isn't. The jewelry is not being used as a medium of exchange. It is the good being purchased. When I buy a candy bar, the candy bar is not a form of money. The currency used to purchase something is what is being used to transact business. If a merchant prices things in ounces of gold, then would you be able to transact in gold. 
Technically, I can see what you are saying. Two items of value are being exchanged for one another in any transaction, but, save for currency exchanges, one of those things being exchanged is a good or service that cannot in a currency based economy be readily exchanged for something else. You can say that the gold pimp-chain you paid $1200 for was part of a 'gold transaction' but try getting change for that piece of bling at the coffee shop. You can spin words, but you know as well as I do that actual transactions with gold (not simply buying gold, but using gold to buy) are extremely rare, because that is not what most people use gold for. They use it as a store of value.

lol. Yeah, I was expecting downvotes on that, but I stand by it. I love bitcoin, and I don't see Ripple as a threat to it. I think bitcoin will remain, but, in the future, I think it will mostly be transacted over the Ripple network, along with most everything else. It's just a faster and more energy efficient and versatile system for moving units of value. Of course, this assumes no major changes to the Bitcoin protocol that would solve some of its limitations, making it more scalable and competitive. I still believe btc will be far more valuable than xrp.

Coinvalidation is not trying to destroy Bitcoin. Quite the contrary, their scheme is paving the way towards mass adoption. I don't like it, and I think we can succeed in mass adoption without anything like it. But I fail to see how making Bitcoin more palatable to regulatory agencies, banks, and merchants would kill it. It would drive the value further towards the moon. I bet the Coinvalidation guys are all heavily invested in btc already. The wealthy don't need Coinvalidation to control the market. Anyone with piles of money can be a market maker, and that's how you influence the market, not by validating or blacklisting coins. All that will do is make it 'safer' for big institutional players to get involved without fear of running afoul of kyc/aml regulation. 
I am against Coinvalidation, because I want all btc to be equal. If a vendor, bank, exchange, or government wants my info to do business with me, that's fine, but the history of the coins in my wallet should no more be my problem than the cocaine residue on my $20 bills. Any mined btc should be forever as valid as any legitimately minted dollar bill (regardless of whether that dollar was once in the snatched purse of some little old lady on a NYT subway in 1983).
BUT, the fact that Coinvalidation is a shitty idea doesn't make your spurious class warfare bullshit any less bullshit. In fact, it detracts significantly from the legitimate arguments that we all need to be making against their model.

True. That makes obvious sense. There must be good ways to put deposits to work, but your point applies beyond just extending credit. Anything that requires converting BTC to fiat must do better than bitcoin. I could cash out and buy a security that outperforms the S&amp;P but not bitcoin, and I would show a loss. Hmm. Banking is a lot less profitable as a simple fee based service, largely because the only incentive to use it is the *promise* of security. Without something like FDIC, the promise isn't worth a whole lot, so in the absence of interest bearing accounts (having instead to pay the bank) I feel users would be few. I certainly would be more comfortable with my paper wallets. Also seems that a reputable ewallet provider could still provide ample security for free and even guarantee security. Being hacked could even prove advantageous, as an opportunity to demonstrate willingness and ability to make good on insurance.

Both are finite. Both have some utility, gold as a raw material and bitcoin as a medium of exchange. Both are attractive stores of value. Whereas gold is the most universal of historic value stores, I think bitcoin is the gold of the new age. 
Gold was better than grain as a medium of exchange, but it's less convenient than modern currency. Bitcoin is revolutionizing money, but the protocol for transacting is slow and inefficient, so, like gold, it will be ultimately the original new money but not heavily used for commerce. You might by a house or a company with bitcoin but not a beer.
Both are valued more for their esoteric attractiveness than for their usefulness. 
Gold is pretty and bitcoin is cool. At the end of the day, cool and pretty are valuable to humans, and our markets will reflect that.

You're the one calling people adorable fools and equating cogent argument about the content of your words to a debate around semantics. My point about redeeming a dollar for a dollar was exactly that such is absurd; I was pointing out the fact that no fiat is "backed" any longer, and the no government in existence "redeems" any currency. My example was an illustration of absurdity, your hypothetical was absurd in itself.
You seem to now be agreeing that my point about the scenario you posited is highly unlikely. And, yes, I concede that you did try to make that clear in your original comment, but that scenario was still the whole of your hypothesis (BTW, to make a semantics point, hypothetical does not mean unlikely, just that a proposition is not a demonstrable reality), so it was the content of your hypothetical against which I made my case. 
When I say never, I employ a slight hyperbole, rather than directly quantifying my estimate of the minuscule chances, which, even then, is merely, like your own hypothesizing about the possible future, my hypothesis. I am not a time traveler. You got me there, though I am not sure that counts as dancing rhetorical circles.

For what reason would any government offer to redeem/back btc? Governments no longer 'back' their own currency with anything. If you take a dollar bill down to the US Treasury and say, "I'd like to redeem this dollar," you would get nothing more than a funny look...maybe four quarters if the guy was feeling frisky.
The danger has nothing to do with govt backing, but with merchants, exchanges, and other institutions refusing to accept non-validated coins, making them worthless. Even if it was just the US to begin with, coins that were unspendable in the US would quickly plummet in value in a global trading economy.

Initially perhaps, but as the value growth stabilizes and btc can be used for loans and investment, like fiat banks do with their deposits, then banking services become profitable while paying their customers interest. Even before then, I think the dividends paid by establishing yourself early on as *the* name in ewallet security or whatever is worth it in the long run. For that reason, I see it being worthwhile to not charge fees. Again, I think Ripple will be a major player here. They recognize what is to be gained by doing what it takes to further adoption. They have major capital behind them, and they are talking to banks already. Integration in a major way is not far off. I personally see btc continuing to be more a value store, like a commodity, that a major tool of exchange. That said, it will be just as easy to transmit, but I think it's relative value will continue to be a bit unstable, if in a good, up-trending way, and that will make it less attractive as a means of buying and selling. Decentralized, cryptographic money is here though, and we are only going to see greater adoption from here on.

Where did you get the 3.1% figure? I couldn't remember myself, so i looked back at my original purchase (pre-verification) and then at one I made 2 days ago. Both showed 1% fees (I had a 15 cent flat rate bank fee, but that is nothing to do with coinbase). Anyway, that jives with my memory when I was first comparing different exchanges, that Coinbase is an across the board 1% fee. 
Anyway, I am genuinely curious where your number came from.

Right, your question/point is valid. I think it's just a 'for lack of a better' type of comparison. Basically, it should be somewhat instructive to look at the market caps of similar, more developed securities to roughly gauge a new thing's potential. I think it's interesting for reddit or pub chatting, but it's like talking about likely scenarios for the end of the world...little hope of getting it right but fun to find data to support your hypothesis. I have about 10xbt, so I love thinking about that being worth $2.5M.

That's why everything is expensive.

Tesla is just one example of a security that received hype, went up in value, corrected, and then enjoyed later growth. Since other things have done this, it is obvious that bitcoin will too. Similarly, I have noticed other white males being very successful in investing, so I expect that based on my general resemblance to other wealthy people, I will also become very wealthy. Because I want to be wealthy, I will just ignore everything contrary. Also, 911 was an inside job.

I suppose that's true. Bitcoin would work through, and it would be enforceable.

Free bitcoin received. Thanks!

Part of what makes it different from a hedge fund is that the individual members are still making their own trading decisions, which affect only their own balances. Thus there is no overall performance for the club (well, it could be calculated, but no one individual's profit is tied in any way to group performance).
There are ways it could be done among strangers. The earlier comment about a decentralized network could work. Likewise, size could engender a certain trust, just like how we trust exchanges and poker sites not to rob us, because they stand to make more by continuing to collect fees/rake. The latter only works well once such an enterprise becomes established enough to be obviously more profitable in the long run than as a quick smash n grab. A final possibility would be to select admins who are well known and trusted members of the larger community.

this. Also, Electrum runs nicely on a TAILS distro, if you wanna be Bond about it.

My only beef with CB is that they are out of fucking coins right now.

I've always liked 'could care less'. To me it's what's left unsaid--'I could care less, but I'm pretty close to giving 0 fucks.' Rather than being so absolute, it's all about the *implications*. Plus, logically, in order to even comment on something, you have to care at least a tiny bit, so it is technically possible, even though you care very little, to care even less.
But whatever, really. Say it however you want. I could care less.

Blockchain wallet emptied out now. Thanks for the heads up.

I used to suck dick for coke; you ever suck some dick for bitcoin?

Cheater! Seriously, though, I have to cheat too; it's cool.

1) They can ask, but there is no way they can firce you to give up bitcoin. They could charge your bank or cc, if they have those, but they can't access those bitcoin without the private key.
2) Try sending a small amount to the addresses that you are receiving from. Put a public note on the transactions. Maybe they'll see it and realize their mistake or explain that they are your secret admirer or something.

bitcoin as a unit of currency is not capitalized, but Bitcoin the protocol is.

Instant buy is a feature Coinbase offers. Because I have verified a bank account and a credit card, submitted proof of identity, and made a few trades over a period of time, Coinbase has extended trust to me. I can now buy up to 50btc a week (started at 10) instantly. Basically, Coinbase still has to wait on my money, but the credit me the bitcoin instantly, trusting that my money will eventually come through, and, if not, that they can charge the credit card I have on file.

Start with the actual wiki, then move on to other sources of information. This sub is not a source of information. It is an entertaining circlejerk full of dumb questions and dumber answers, with the occasional bit of useful news, linked from somewhere else. There are tons of places to learn about Bitcoin, but start here: 
@_date: 2013-11-17 21:55:00
Ah. So the credit card is a backup, in case the bank draft were to fail after Coinbase already gave you coin. In the event that your cc was actually charged, the higher fee is incurred. So long as your bank account has the funds to pay for your btc purchase, that will never happen.

Alright, that's valid. I won't do it again.

Didn't work for me either.
