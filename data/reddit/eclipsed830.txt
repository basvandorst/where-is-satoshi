Except it was entirely possible already to do a case by case extradition from Hong Kong to Taiwan with yhr current law. As a matter of fact, Taiwan made such requests specifically following the current framework on 4 separate occasions. Each request was ignored by the HK government.
The extradition bill wasn't actually a fresh bill, it was an amendment to the current law that also allowed extraditions to China. It is not necessary for case by case extradition to Taiwan.

Again, didn't you say this was about the murder case? Do you not care about justice?
It's fair because Hong Kong has an independent legal system with a strong rule of law. China does not. China's court system is not fair nor balanced, it's not compatible with Hong Kongs current legal system.

The guy killed his girlfriend in Taiwan and fled to Hong Kong. This issue is between the two legal systems of Hong Kong and Taiwan. It's already possible to do a case by case extradition from Hong Kong to Taiwan using HK's current Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Ordinance. Taiwan has requested the suspect on 4 individual occasions specifically using the guidelines provided by the Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Ordinance.
You said that this murder case was the reason the bill was created, it is not. This murder has nothing to do with the bill that was created, it was simply being used as an excuse... I'm guessing the CCP told Carrie Lam NOT to do a case by case extradition to Taiwan unless the bill was passed... so actually either CCP or Carrie Lam did create this mess which makes the protests somewhat justified.

What does America have to do with ANYTHING? ������
Again, the murder happened in Taiwan, the suspect fled to Hong Kong. **A new extradition bill isn't required to perform a case by case extradition from Hong Kong to Taiwan**.
This had nothing to do with China. CHINA made it about China by instructing Lam to pass this bill.
This has nothing to do with America. Wtf??? Don't be such a wumao.
