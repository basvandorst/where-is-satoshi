If the US government, for example, made it illegal to control bitcoin that had previously been used for some illegal purpose (or made it subject to seizure), the demand for 'clean' bitcoin would increase and would drop for tainted coins. This breaks fungibility.

Please.  Give the man what he wants.  He's visiting because his escort service just told him they're only accepting bitcoin now and he needs a tutorial.

Yeah, most of their products require a prescription in most countries, so buying them is illegal.  *How* illegal depends on which you buy.  I read somewhere that for most of these the legal punishment is just confiscation when the package hits customs.

I think you're right, but the danger would be them getting a patent for something trivial that will be needed in the "next step".  Some obvious process that nobody has ever done before because it's never been needed.  OSS devs would likely not think much about it, but BoA devs and lawyers might jump at the chance to patent it.

I don't know if it's fair to say "usually".  I imagine many of the people we consider thought leaders whose opinion we consume in the news or on Twitter are well off enough to live wherever they want.  Off the top of my head, the most desirable places to live (whether neighborhoods or countries) are fairly homogeneous.  From exclusive mansion-rich suburbs to Caribbean islands.  Added: I'm actually pausing now to consider if there's correlation there, lol.
I've met plenty of people who share my political opinions where I live in Houston and in other parts of Texas and I imagine this has got to be one of the most diverse parts of the country.
But I do agree with your point about it being easy to preach about Utopian ideals from positions where one doesn't have to deal with its realities.

Yes.  It's a matter of perspective, of course, but I certainly think so.

I'm not trying to be a dick and I'm not a Bitcoin expert, so this is a sincere question: If you prefer a regulated currency, what is your attraction to Bitcoin?  It seems there are fully-regulated alternatives.

No.  He's being prosecuted and investigated under these ridiculous laws by people who claim to be authorities.  If he is/we are forced to participate in this farce, it's reasonable to expect these people to follow these laws, too.
And if they can't, let's dispense with the charade.

Also, I think the suggestion is that if other asset classes take a shit, demand for bitcoin will increase, raising the price.

What product/service does your company provide? I'm trying to imagine what B2B industry might actually be ready to start dealing in bitcoin (excluding the "blockchain all the things" startups). 
I work at a B2B company and sometimes jokingly suggest we should start accepting bitcoin, but nobody knows what that is so they just look at me like at me like I'm retarded. 
@_date: 2016-09-10 02:20:02
Cool, thanks! 
We provide demand generation services.
We don't use Stripe. Our average deal sizes are probably in the $60k range and the most common payment method is check. Occasionally credit cards if the client is making multiple smaller payments - we use a conventional gateway for those. 
I see my previous post got downvoted, I think it must have been taken as hating on bitcoin. That wasn't my intent, I'm just having a hard time imagining Lockheed or GE accepting or paying with btc anytime soon - though I'd love to see it.

Yeah, I'm not sure Liberland is very practical right now; it probably won't ever be. However, I think it's a nice "fuck you" to convention and might spread awareness of things like seasteading and limited government.

No. A stock might offer dividends. Someone wants to cash out and sells. Someone else is willing to be more patient and expects ROI on the dividends. Both are are happy and neither are fools.

I prefer soundcloud to YouTube because I listen during my commute. The YouTube app keeps the screen on, killing my battery. 
I know the premium youtube subscription will continue playing with the screen off, but I don't think there are any other features I need, so I haven't bought it. 
I'm not volunteering, but have you considered asking your listeners if someone would be willing to edit and upload the episodes? You could pay them with some of your garbage.

Is the phrase you're looking for "money market"? 
Anyway, similar to what was suggested above, I'd say move the money you want to buy bitcoin with to a checking account. You can then fund a bitcoin exchange account with that. 
I'm a little worried that if you have a meeting with a banker, you might run afoul of some obscure regulation about what you're allowed to do with your money. I don't know how it works in Canada, but there have been threads on here about US accounts being frozen because the bank got skittish at the mention of bitcoin. 
The trezor and paper wallet suggtions above are both good. Do a lot of googling and reading about those phrases and you'll increase your chances of having this go smoothly. 
A tip I haven't seen mentioned in this thread yet: once you buy the bitcoin, don't leave it on the exchange any longer than you have to.

This domain was created [two weeks ago](  Is that enough time to work out all the complexities that come with running a public exchange?
Exchanges charge their users a percentage to use their services.  This is how they are able to keep the lights on and provide a profit.  This exchange, on the other hand, is giving away 10% to users.
Why would they do that?  Some kind of introductory offer?  Fine - all they would have to do is offer 0% transaction fees and still blow their competition out of the water (and still save themselves 10% in operating expenses on each trade).
It's a scam.

I'd argue virtually all of my public high school teachers failed me, but since you bring it up, let's go with that example.
My kids attend supposedly one of the better school districts in my state, and it's still terrible.  I pay a lot in taxes; sales, property, income, etc. to fund this substandard school.
Combine that with me being forced to pay for drug law enforcement, domestic surveillance, non-stop military action, ethanol subsidies, and [insert your favorite example of wasteful government spending here] and I can't afford to also pay for a private school for them.  So my children consume the substandard service I am forced to pay for.
I'm sorry.  This self realization you expect me to be having seems very elusive.  But I appreciate your continued efforts.

 is fairly easy, takes a few days to receive your bitcoin. 
 you'll find someone local willing to sell. Best choice if anonymity is essential to you. 
Check Google to see if there is a bitcoin atm near you. They usually have high fees, though. 
 is a p2p bitcoin exchange. 
Check the sidebar for plenty of other ways and tips for beginners. 
@_date: 2016-10-31 12:43:24
It's one of the better options if you want to buy something illegal because it allows for more anonymity.

I think so. For the US, China, Russia, etc., $400 million isn't that much. This would be a relatively small effort. I think they could do it. 
There are many government owned data centers. Dedicate a corner in a few of these and you've got the facilities. Getting the machines would be a challenge (sudden huge demand that the market would notice), but I suspect it could be pulled off. 
I'm not terribly worried about it because the people capable of doing it probably aren't too worried about bitcoin right now.

The audience to all this isn't just Bitcoin users and enthusiasts.  Analysts, journalists, Bitcoin-curious, and the general public are all watching - both lovers and haters of Bitcoin.
A lot of people will listen to what the "creator of Bitcoin" has to say about a wide variety of topics.
Even Bitcoin users aren't immune to appealing to authority.  People on both sides of the block size debate have used speculation about Satoshi's vision to support their arguments.
