Does it matter? It's not like people are going to stop mining gold.

Man no offense, but I think you need to relax. First off, I doubt people are paying that much attention to your finances. Most people are just trying to get by, and frugality is generally seen as a positive trait as long as you aren't a total miser. Most people have very little savings or investments, and having the discipline to save is also a positive trait. You dont even have to tell people you buy bitcoin if investing comes up, just that you make a point to invest and set aside money. If the people you associate with are super concerned about material possessions, find new people to spend time with.

BITCOIN COULD GO UP BUT BITCOIN COULD ALSO MAYBE GO DOWN INSTEAD.

I think this has been the situation basically the whole time.

Mike Maloney is a pretty cool dude he has a few books, one I read was a really great explanation of why gold became and remains a store of value and it helps wrap your head around how money works. 
I dont know that I think the world financial system will collapse, but guys like Mike Maloney and Jim Rickards are really good at explaining the flaws present in the system and extrapolating worst case scenarios that could come from it. That's good stuff to be aware of. I've come to see the value in holding some precious metals, and also the corollary they have with crypto, as counterintuitive as it may seem at first.

I like Warren Buffet and Charlie Munger but who gives a fuck what they think about bitcoin?  I don't ask my parents for advice when buying computer parts and I wouldn't ask Warren Buffet what he thinks about Facebook let alone Bitcoin. He's irrelevant to the conversation.

The similarities are strong. In fact a lot of figures in poker are also involved in crypto, with Doug Polk being the most well known example. As he says, it was a natural and easy way to move around large sums of money without the bank being involved, perfect for people who deal with big sums at all hours of the day. 
The ability to weather brutal downturns and not let big upward swings go to your head also makes poker players well suited to this market. As somebody involved in both, I can say they complement each other.
