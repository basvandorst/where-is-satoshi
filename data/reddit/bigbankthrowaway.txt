Could it be that banks are cracking down? This is anecdotal be recently happened to me, long story but I'll make it short. 
Selling on localbitcoins. Scammer scams my out of *under* $1000.00. Reported to bank many, many times. Tons of phone calls, etc. Bank freezes my account in the low 5 digits. My pending coinbase buys are also canceled on account of them being rejected by the bank since the account it froze. Bank states they are closing the account and *not* refunding the scammed money. No reason given other than it being a "business decision". It will take 10 business days before they *mail* a check which means no access my *my* money for 2-3 weeks.

I'm told in almost all these cases you want a *lawyer*. Period.

I'm in a (somewhat) similar situation but the amount it not anywhere near as much. It's with a big US bank that I was using on localbitcoins. The situation started with a "man in the middle" scam against me. The amount was under $1000. Basically they made a cash deposit, called scam, and asked for the money back and got it. Bank freezes my account with a 5 figure balance and pending outgoing ACH's.... which of course were declined making me look like an asshole. 
This is all a few weeks after I open the account. Dozens of phone calls later I'm not getting anywhere. In fact quite a few reps told me my account was "fine" after my debit card quit working. Nope. Turns out a it had it nothing to do with the card, the *entire* account was frozen. Worse is that only one person in the company could unlock it and *that's* according to the fraud department. However that "magic person" insisted the fraud department would call *me*. They never did. When I called them they said their was nothing they could do. 
So I visit the local branch where I opened the account, the same guy that helped me open it looked into the case. Tons of heming, and hawing. Then he makes a phone call, more heming and hawing.... "but that doesn't make any sense" he says, more than once while on the phone. Turns out the issue is beyond his control. He claims they are closing my account and cutting me a cashiers check "within 10 days". He was as helpful as he could be but I left with the impression that his hands are completely tied on the mater. 
Until then my money is frozen. The branch wouldn't even even give me a few hundred cash. I've had no opportunity to plead my case or submit any documentation nor have I been asked to.  Not that any of this helps you but I wanted to share.
