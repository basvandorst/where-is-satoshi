Do you own research

I invested in Bitcoin and I can afford a lot more sips!

Nope, unless you program it yourself, you’ll probably get scammed and loose everything. Just buy and HODL.

Craig Wright is a Fraud!

I usually send mine 1 Sat/byte, they always go through. Just give it time.

I like using Sats in my Lightning wallet

That’s partially true. You’re forgetting how Breton Woods worked. It was really gold as coinage ended in 1933, silver coinage ended in 1964, but gold backed as money (i.e. The Gold Standard) ended in 1971, as I stated. Also, after 1933 the economy didn’t pick up, until arguably the beginnings of WWII.

Coinbase is legit. Some people don’t like some of the business choices they have made, and boycott them, but they will not steal your ID.

Craig Wright is a Psycho, and a Scam Artist, not the inventor of Bitcoin.

I had a similar issue when I first used BlueWallet. Use their node and not yours and your transactions should go through. Try doing some transactions through your node itself as well, just for fun.

“The last remnants of the gold standard ended in 1971”. See we totally agree ;)

Yes, the US was on the gold standard until 1971 (gold also a deflationary currency), and capitalism worked just fine.

If you’re in a hurry, you pay higher fees, if you’re not set it to 1 Sat/byte and it will eventually go through.

Best is to connect to a couple hubs (2 or 3) and a lot (17 to 37) of smaller less connected nodes, if you want to be a useful public node and earn fees in the future.

Wondering if this only affects Windows users? Or if MacOS and Linux are also vulnerable? Thanks

Lightning Network ⚡️⚡️
@_date: 2019-05-21 20:16:04
Lightning is still in Alpha, it’ll be easier by Beta. Which implementation did you use? LND? C-Lightning? Or Eclair? If you’re looking for a Plug N Play option checkout Casa Node.
