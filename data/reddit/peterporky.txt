WOW $6,000,000 in bitcoin. It's hard to imagine $4,000,000 in bitcoin being donated.

Once it hit 12k the first time I was like "Fuck, now I definitely want to buy. I'll just wait until it goes down. There's no way it'll keep going up". Bought it at 14k.
If I was more patient, I'd definitely be buying now.

Bitcoin is at a 20% discount itself right now ;)

@_date: 2017-12-23 11:45:28
It was always memes.
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:30:15
idk man. My first transfer took 3 days to transfer. Idk why yours transferred immediately but somehow isn't appearing.
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:24:30
happy cakeday
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:49:41

@_date: 2017-12-23 08:35:17


investing in bitcoin is like going to Vegas with Rain Man

Ok, buying something that's pinned to the price of bitcoin for free instead of getting gauged a 0.5% commission on coinbase every time I make a transaction.
@_date: 2019-08-14 09:45:11
If it's something pinned to the price it seems like it's basically the same thing ain't it? Presuming Robinhood doesn't explode.
@_date: 2019-08-14 09:11:36
Um, then how am I doing it...? They started allowing it like a month and a half ago.
@_date: 2019-08-14 09:01:46
I switched to Robinhood as soon as it allowed it. Fuck Coinbase.
@_date: 2019-08-14 12:42:48
You can do limit orders if you want. Robinhood's tracker is behind by some time, if you check the price on Yahoo it's usually the same.

It has value and is used as a medium of exchange it's currency by definition.

@_date: 2019-05-26 19:53:56
I'm thinking of buying more no fomo
@_date: 2019-05-17 04:24:53
I think it'll re-adjust to 7.8k or so before it continues the slow burn its been going
@_date: 2019-05-26 19:53:14
this is good for bitcoin
@_date: 2019-05-26 23:49:56
Is it worth the power cost??
@_date: 2019-05-17 04:20:13
@_date: 2019-05-17 04:57:29
lol look at this kid thinking he's smarter than Albert Einstein
@_date: 2019-05-17 04:30:07
Yeah I'm going to watch it like a hawk as it rounds 7.8k, sell, buy back in once it goes down to around mid 6k
@_date: 2019-05-17 14:43:34
@_date: 2019-05-17 04:37:14
I feel you. When I trade stock I day trade so I only worry about it when I have it. It's easier not to worry about money you aren't risking than money you are.
@_date: 2019-05-26 19:54:27
well of course I know him, he's me
@_date: 2019-05-26 20:10:14
