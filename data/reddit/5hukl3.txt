This thread is ridiculous. So much hate for artists.
Good on this guy for making a a bit of money through his art. Artists are some of the most important people on earth. They help shape our culture and give meaning to life. They help you see the world through different eyes and keep your mind awake and open to new ideas.
America's position as one of the main powers of this world wouldn't exist without the influence of its musicians, writers, filmmakers and painters.
I'd rather live in a world with every wall covered with art than advertisement.
Yet, 90% of them are starving because people are jealous that they don't have to have a shit job to survive...
I doubt this whole qr code is a long-term solution, but it's a very cool story at least and gives hope. Im an artist myself and I have great hope block chain and cryptos will change our lives for the better.

To be honest, I think BCH will hit 4k before NYE. I had transfered half of my btc in bch 3 days ago, following advice of a good friend who's made a shit ton of money betting on all kinds of currencies. Seeing btc going up and bch and the down, I put all my bch in btc again yesterday. I am still planning to buy a bunch of bch once it reaches 800. I think both currencies will dominate next year and I'm planning to take full advantage of it.

I'm a total newbie to this, so this might be totally wrong but it seems like it's basicly lots of people buying the dip. Maybe the Amazon rumor as well?
