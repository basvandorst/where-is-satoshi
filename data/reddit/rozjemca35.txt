They don't want to have means of payment not controlled by them.

Hi all, i'm rozjemca which means peacemaker. I actually prefer the other site (and chain). Can we be friends even if i have different opinion than most of you? It's up to you.

Sholdn't you rate an app based on it's usefulness, performance, security, etc rather than just their naming convention?

It would never be worth that much if he hadn't bought them.

What is the correlation with the marketcap? could someone check?

The other option is for the BTC price to double from what it is now, and we've seen it's possible.

Whole purpose of proof-of-work is that once transaction is accepted in the chain (longest chain), it does not require any further validation. It's set in stone, forever. Why would you need to re-validate blockchain if it was already done? Re-work is never good, any decent company will tell you that.

Purpose of crypto is full control of your money. You don't need to rely on 3rd party. Paypay is 3rd party, and it's good until it will fail you.

Just spend some time in different sites to gather the faucet money, and then convert them to BTC if that's what you want.

Governments don't consider Bitcoin a currency, because only central banks can issue it according to law. So BTC is more of commodity

who won? :)

Great, that's exactly what should be done.

Maybe the need for 51% of total BTC hashrate? Good luck in spending millions of $ for that, just to try stealing some.

Great explanation.
The issue i see here is when the middle guy would also like to transfer 2 marbles to the last 3rd guy, but since he already routed 2 marbles he may be out of funds. So he would need to route through different route or deposit more funds to the channel.

You should ask around the companies who already set their stores up. I'm pretty sure they would help you as adoption would benefit them as well.
