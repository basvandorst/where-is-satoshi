Oh yeah because that's how you fix this.
Go fuck yourself.

What are your sources, you have none apparently. Lots of detail information as if you're an engineer that built skyscrapers. I know that's not true so don't bother saying...
Your impression of the car bombing is opposite of the engineer that built the building.
"I don't believe that 67% number," That's the standard and design the building was built to. Period.
How did the building cascade implode from... how did it collapse again, I'd like to know what you believe. It's some outlandish shit for sure.
"The exterior columns of the Twin Towers, for exam
ple, used only about 20% of their capacity to withstand 
gravity loads, leaving a large margin for the additional 
lateral loads that occur during high-wind and seismic 
In the case of WTC 7, for example, the 
factor of safety was generally 3 or higher. Here, 67% of the 
strength would need to be lost for failure to ensue, which 
would require the steel to be heated to about 660°C);

Also, the uni-bomber can blow half a building up but it doesn't collapse, but a "domino" effect from 1 beam being pushed off by "expansion" from a fire, with a building with adequate fire protection caused the ENTIRE BUILDING to fall into it's own footprint exactly like controlled demolition. You ever see controlled demolition gone wrong? It happens.

You're undeniably ridiculous.

Next time put a noose around your neck from the ceiling and lean forward while tighten the noose, standing on some shitty furniture.

Building 7 would have to lose 67% of it's strength to breakdown.
It didn't get hit by anything at all.
The twin towers are overbuilt to withstand wind loads (calm winds that day), and were specifically designed to withstand a plane strike.
In fact, the head engineer said in a ~92? article from Seattle after the twin tower car bombing, that he believe only controlled demolition could take down the towers.
Another weird thing was there was a hurricane 400 miles away from new york, hurricane erin, that very day.
