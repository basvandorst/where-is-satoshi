This is a brilliant idea if in fact your premises are correct.
@_date: 2012-05-07 23:54:28
They say that it has worked with most of them and only when loading it with a value that does not exceed the limit of the card.  
@_date: 2012-07-06 13:36:50
They did.
@_date: 2012-07-04 14:02:26
What could it hurt to try?
@_date: 2012-05-07 18:24:57
Don't feed the trolls.

I can't argue with you on the physics we( humans ) understand, clearly I'm out classed here.  But what if your(we're) wrong?  What if we don't understand diddly squat about what it takes to communicate across space?  For me, a couple dollars a year is nothing and though it may be a long shot, the payout would be immense.  Do you buy lottery tickets?
@_date: 2012-07-04 16:18:00
You don't think elux buys lottery tickets?  Me neither.

@_date: 2012-07-06 12:00:51
Sure they are, 2mil a year.
@_date: 2013-05-15 17:27:25
Thank you!
@_date: 2013-03-25 19:02:06
lol, exactly what I was thinking.
@_date: 2013-04-03 14:59:13
What kind of shenanigans is this?  This should never happen in production.
@_date: 2013-07-23 18:01:44
Amazon takes bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-02-27 16:42:30
That's not what the OP wants.
No, I don't know of anything quite like that.
@_date: 2013-04-03 14:48:02
They're up!  And it sounds purrty!
Odd.. mtgox is up, listentobitocoin is up and singing... but bitcoinity is not getting any feeds.
Anyone else?
@_date: 2013-03-22 17:34:36
Well of course it's a very small view, it's only mine.
@_date: 2013-08-29 19:36:39
I wasn't expressing an opinion on the blog either way, I was just aggregating some information.
Thank you for yours though! :)
@_date: 2013-04-03 14:59:56
The site is up for me.  Though there is no update.
on top of that  is working just fine for me.
@_date: 2013-07-28 06:20:38
Hi there. There are some on Amazon but I want a custum build.
I'd be willing to buy by proxy with a mod as escrow but we're talking about upwards of 2k. What kind of compensation am I looking at?
@_date: 2013-03-22 14:05:58
Programmer here also.
I've been looking for a way into this market, but it seems every niche has been filled or the entry barriers are too big to overcome by myself.
It seems your proposing some collaboration with no other goals except for what this collaborative work could produce.  Is that about right?
@_date: 2013-05-17 14:56:24
Not sure, but blocked IP's don't mean blocked bitcoin transactions to their addresses.
@_date: 2013-03-28 21:18:45
sweet, time to buy more.
@_date: 2013-04-03 15:21:36
Your right, it was.
@_date: 2013-04-01 14:45:44
I noticed that too.  Multiple .05 trades.  What is that?
@_date: 2013-08-09 21:46:59
An architectural security model. I was just throwing out ideas.  A proxy, perhaps between DMZ's where only the proxy could communicate egress to DMZ2.
* Application Server
* Hot Wallet
* Database
* Hot Wallet?( option )
* Cold Wallet
It's very important that the security only allows authentic transactions to occur and that a compromised system does not compromise others.
@_date: 2013-03-25 18:42:32
I think, at some point in the future when coins become worth some serious money and, if/when cryptography strength increases due to technological advances making old wallets( using old crypto) less secure, people will treasure hunt.
I imagine finding old lost wallets, using old crypto and opening them up using modern tech for the riches that they hold.
@_date: 2013-07-18 18:56:25
ohh kay.  What site is this?
@_date: 2013-03-19 20:21:06
lol...this guy.
Edit: OP technically correct but missing the point.
@_date: 2013-03-25 20:55:50
What are the conditions of your proposal?
@_date: 2013-03-28 20:24:06
ConditionDelta is correct you junky.  Try doing this sober.
@_date: 2013-05-03 13:43:05
What do you have to say about sufaq's statements below?
@_date: 2013-03-25 20:50:52
Yea, I'm absolutely talking about breaking private keys.
The scenario involves certain conditions.
* Today's encryption standards have become weak due to improvements in technology and/or new weaknesses found.
* Bitcoin continues, with a new protocol using modern ciphers.
* People migrate over to new protocols.
* Older hashes left out on the network now become targets for thiefs ( in the event people failed to migrate ) or treasure hunters ( people that lost or forgot their wallets...or dead people )
A new age of Treasure Hunters begins!
@_date: 2013-05-03 13:29:17
What shameful actions?  What BS?  Speak up man!
Edit:  Never-mind, reading further down.
@_date: 2013-05-24 19:42:07
I think you can install apps on the Android SDK emulator.  I'd have a wack at it if I weren't so lazy.
@_date: 2013-07-28 15:59:40
Oh, that looks great!  Thank you!
