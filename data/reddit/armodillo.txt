Do you really think the main threat of price manipulation is shallow orderbooks? I say that shallow orderbooks and price manipulation do not really fit together when it is about Bitcoin.
Once the shallow Orderbook breaks in it gives people an opportunity to do arbitrage trading. Eventually the price will be the same. Result will be dead cat bounces (as we have seen on Btc-E) and not a manipulated price. The problem is that false news that are published on purpose are the meanest and most dangerous price manipulations.

Hi, can my dog solve those riddles? much calculations many hashes wow

just go on [ and click on 2y (so you can see the graph for the last two years).
I am not pushing people to buy bitcoin, but just have a look at the graph - it looks very promising to me. Even without talking about all the important steps that the currency already took or is about to take (legal alignments of exchange sites,  Shutdown "black markets" etc.).

Couldn't the  'benevolent philanthropist' problematic be solved with the ability to verify transactions through blockchain? Given the fact that the big merchant IDs are known.

Either hold or spend it (when you need financial power) over the bitcoin ecosystem.
Cashing out kills value.
@_date: 2013-11-21 14:04:12
yes :) price isnt everything - although 95% of people (or more) only make their decision based on price, because it is much easier to compare.

Seems like the "Vulnerabilty" has been broadly discussed back in 2010 and branded "not feasable" - some techy can give further statements regarding this?
Yes, we all know what the abbreviation FUD stands for. But how is it possible to separate FUD and useful criticism?
@_date: 2013-11-12 08:17:26
and lieferservice.at - I guess this is connected to the press release "Dutch Food Delivery Site accepts Bitcoin" - which could be Takeaway.com , being a large multi-brand corporate.
This explains why loads of food deliverers are accepting bitcoin "overnight". 
Seems like we have the third branch assimilated to bitcoin (drugdealing -&gt; Hoster/PC Retailers -&gt; fooddelivery)

Just send some bitcoins to any bitcoin exchange site of your choice and try to get them back.
This should keep you occupied for at least 1 week / exchange

I would love to dive into that matter, but unfortunately I am not able to (workrelated). But I am sure you can get a decent picture of the pro/con of this exchange by having a look at the forum discussions.

Hm yes. An exchange that is able to take such a tough hit and is still able to stand does not seem to be the worst of alternatives. 
Furthermore, i trade on gox since more than half a year now and (not taking liquidity issues into account) they are not that bad. I had more issues on other exchanges.

Well, bitcoin is an alternative financial system that endangers the power of the established - if not triggers a serious shifting of power. What is "much worse" than those people having immense power and trying to defend it by all means?

"In finance, investment is putting money into an asset with the expectation of capital appreciation, dividends, and/or interest earnings. This may or may not be backed by research and analysis. Most or all forms of investment involve some form of risk, such as investment in equities, property, and even fixed interest securities which are subject, among other things, to inflation risk."

Do they have legal alignment in terms of "getting account closed by authorities like it happend at bitcoin-24.com" ?
@_date: 2013-11-18 09:58:56
Exactly. But when is a cheap coin a cheap coin, and when is it "OMG WTF SHIT IM GONNA DUMP LAWL SO MUCH BID WOW MANY BTC"?
If the course breaks in such violently, people will follow and sell (and they did).
But people could buy "cheap coins" because china has immense demand
@_date: 2013-11-08 11:26:41
Yeah, but they were speaking about that their new trading engine (MIDAS) is able to perform 500.000 orders / second. This is nowhere close  to reality in my eyes. Why does it take 10 seconds to match an unlimited 1.7k btc buy? 
Futhermore, they are not able to offer withdrawals of US$ for quite a few months now - did they even give a press release out, why ?
If the BTC-withdrawal won't be available soon, mt.gox will die.
And if I cant get my BTC from mt.gox, it would be the second time i lose because of crappy exchange site management. Fun is something else.
@_date: 2013-10-10 14:15:54
U mean: someone buys Bitcoins for US Dollars and then sells them for CNY ?
After my understanding, the first trade should be registered for US $ Trades, the second should count for CNY Trades.
I can't follow, why bitcoincharts.com and bitcoinwatch.com have such different last24h Volumes.

Sorry, but does it really matter what the specifications of "vapor ware" are? 
Cointerra tried to engage the bitcoin community, didn't they presume difficulty of 144M in end of 2014 in all their ROI calculations?
@_date: 2013-11-15 09:06:49
yeah sure. I personally would not buy from merchants that support that coinvalidation bullshit. Because they obviously are under political pressure.
Although we people in Germany have quite a remarkable history about "not to buy from single merchants"

Maybe this was the reason why people panic-sold BTC all over the world ;D
@_date: 2013-11-26 10:19:45
Exactly. Lost too much funds on websites that did not have legal alignment and therefore got closed down.
