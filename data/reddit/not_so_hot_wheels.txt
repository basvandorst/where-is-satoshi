yep it would be really attractive although i imagine it will be hard to sell them all at once. i think it would be worth considering selling 50 or 100 at a time, that would at least get money for building work for the house and if you sold them at maybe £500 each you could sell them fairly fast? good luck anyway :)

i talk to / at my friends and family about bitcoin a lot of the time, but i don't try and convince them to buy any. they can choose to look more into it / invest on their own. i don't want to be the guy to tell them to do something which loses them money, either by a fall in value or a hack

To be honest, choosing not to invest in bitcoin poses no risk what so ever. I have maybe .0037 bitcoins from the karma exchange, but I can't afford to invest anything yet. I am also quite happy watching bitcoins become stronger. Even when the value increases in the future, I can buy in then, not to make money, but to use them as a currency. Making money is not that big of an issue for me at the moment :)
People maybe have missed the boat to make money (I don't believe this) but they have not missed the boat to be a part of bitcoin, you can buy in at any time, with any amount, that is part of its beauty

yep, they still exist but no one will have access to them and so they are effectively out of the bitcoin economic system as they will never be used again.

I don't think everyone who pays taxes would be willing to hire a hitman, I think they are two very different situations

I am from the UK, if you refuse to pay taxes, you are also refusing to fund the NHS and fire services, does this mean you are killing people?

bitcoin is not infinitely divisible, i think it is written into the code that a coin can only be divided to 8 decimal places (possibly 7?). 
Inflation is the general increase in prices, so it is the goods that you buy whose price will inflate, rather than the currency used to bu the goods. 
As with all currencies, the bitcoin value can both appreciate and depreciate. 
One of the biggest problems in a market is deflation. In the real world if a country experiences deflation then business tends to grind to a halt as people do not buy things as they can wait another week and buy the item for a lower price. The rapid appreciation in bitcoin means that a lot of people are just hoarding coins at the moment rather than spending them, but it doesn't seem to be that big an issue for bitcoins as bitcoins has many other selling points beyond being just a currency.

really? i didn't know that, i stand corrected :)
@_date: 2013-10-24 19:05:29
they are not lost as they still exist, but there is no access to them, so no one can use them :)
@_date: 2013-10-10 12:43:05
Hiring a hit man is radically different from paying your taxes.
@_date: 2013-10-27 20:57:04
No but that is just a specific industry. General growth (many believe) will slow down dramatically when there is deflation. 


This is separate to what this thread is discussing, so apologies for going off topic. Also it comes down to different economic opinions. I do think though that there will be a problem with the price of bitcoins rising too fast as it will discourage spending and encourage hoarding... but then it raises awareness in the media which can only be a good thing

Hi thanks for this post. I have read a few articles that talk about the bitcoin flaw. Am i correct in thinking that this is only in terms of mining, and as you say, the selfish mining issue? 
From what you say, honest miners will always have a chance at mining some bitcoins as they only try and mine the first bloc they see? Am i making it too simple / confusing myself?
Bitcoin as a currency is not flawed, or at least, no flaws have been found so far? Would selfish mining have a big impact on the bitcoin economy? Surely it is established enough now and over 56% (i think) of the coins have been mined?
Am i quite lost? Sorry for the questions. Thanks for the answers :)

and not all of us have bought bitcoins yet :) (although i guess you can assume all 60k subscribers have done the karma exchange for bitcoins)
@_date: 2013-12-05 12:03:01
They would still have their 1200 mBTC but the value for each mBTC would have fallen.

So everyone who doesn't pay tax should go to prison for tax avoidance and everyone who does should go to prison for murder? It is an argument that will get us no where. This guy tried using his money to have someone killed, we do not decide where our taxes are distributed, IMO there is a difference.
When you pay taxes, these go to the government who then pay the army, you are not paying the army directly. From what I understand he asked a 'hitman' directly.
@_date: 2013-12-05 12:28:18
They will see a lot less money, but unless they decide to sell their mBTC and then buy it back straight away, they will not be losing 200 mBTC, they will be losing $200.

My worry is that the steady state will lead to an overshoot :/

The prices on bitbargain are really expensive because it is the only option, they are not cheap. The cheapest coin is currently £722 or $1182 and the current bitstamp price is $1054. When the bitcoin price rises it is not uncommon for prices to be $150 above bitstamp prices
@_date: 2013-05-02 16:32:51
could that be the reason?
@_date: 2013-10-10 12:20:09
I don't think people paying taxes equates to hiring hit men though. I think what he did was wrong, even if he was under the threat of prison. We give the gov money, they then give it to the army who then kill people. If anyone gives money to anyone, there will be a big chain of people and at some point in the chain of money exchange, some of the money will be used in crime / to hurt people. 
If you directly give money to the army then i can understand your point, but by paying taxes? i have to disagree with you. The only way to avoid any money you spend being used to fund crime would be to never spend any

~~You can keep using smaller denominations of bitcoins indefinitely as well can you not? Which is what i expect to happen when the cap is reached.~~ &lt;- my edit
I think one of the main similarities is that, as with tulip mania, people were buying the bulbs with no intention to plant them and make flowers. This is similar to people buying bit coins with no intention of spending them, instead, they are just speculating that the price will rise, which happened with both, they both lost their primary purpose.
I may be wrong, this is just my opinion.

If you are in this for the correct reasons you will be spending bitcoins on goods and services and not just hoarding them.
