Oh I totally agree in this case 
@_date: 2018-09-08 15:08:00
Look at how many times 6k was reached or became the price and how many times it bounced off it. The more often it did the more support it has at that level. 
@_date: 2018-09-06 16:35:39
Every time the price drops I just buy more. 
@_date: 2018-09-29 04:48:58
You’ll thank yourself when it’s back up to 20k

I’m with you on this.

I don't agree that the fee is ridiculous.  I agree in competition, but how can you compete with a guy that works for free?

Made an update and broke some transactions. They’re working on a fix. 
@_date: 2014-01-02 14:37:09
It will be a long time.  I was doing some research into getting ONE going, and the legal hoops and cost are ridiculous.  I estimate at least 250k to get a Money Transmitter license.

Here's an example:

I've spoken to Robocoin about this, and they do offer a lot of value added services, but 30% is a bit steep.  Hopefully when more competition enters the market, this will change.
@_date: 2014-01-29 15:10:49
I don't agree.  At least with regard to the startup cost.  Robocoin is taking 30% of that 7%, plus maintenance.  I would be willing to bet that as the network expands, the fee will be reduced.  I think the convenience factor is more than worth it.  I have paid more than that in an online vendor.
@_date: 2014-02-18 21:31:49
Son of a bitch...lol.  Congrats for them though.   This is good news for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-02-18 21:12:59
I'd like to know how this was done.  They registered with FINCEN, but are the local state laws allowing them around KYC or AML policies because its a "sales kiosk?"
@_date: 2014-01-09 02:47:45
I hope someone in this country helps to establish an easy way to get someone setup in the business of BTC ATMs.  
I did some research and found its extremely difficult to get registered as a money transmitter in this country, and costly.  Much more than the 5k for that ATM.

I agree with this article seeing as how this changed for me as well. I’m making the money work for me and doing pretty well. Am I worried it will never go up again?  No. 
@_date: 2018-06-13 17:39:25
I sold everything before this dump. Waiting for the bottom now.

Videos like these are good. We were asking ourselves this in 2013-2014
@_date: 2018-06-15 15:30:50
What will happen is we’ll get to the point where people capitulate and think the price will never go back up.

Do NOT tell anyone the balance.
@_date: 2018-06-13 16:35:12
Yes this 
@_date: 2019-10-17 21:59:45
Don’t forget the increased cost to mine will set a much higher floor than current as well.
@_date: 2019-10-26 14:30:36

That’s what I would have done.

The level of adoption increases as time goes on irrelevant of price. There is scarcity like gold and the price continues to rise exponentially over time. I dismissed bitcoin many times and lost out on some amazing opportunities.

His prediction at least for price so far is soon to be debunked provided the price doesn’t hit 100k this year.

I think you’ll need the key ring files to decrypt the email. Do a google search to see what the file extensions those files are. If you can find the pgp or asc files (that are encrypted) you should be able to use the app to decrypt the email.

No, the five dollar wrench attack is what they use against you to compel you to give up your passphrase.

Cool points? It does help to split up the value. Never put all your eggs in one basket?
@_date: 2019-09-04 14:50:23
5 dollar wrench attack usually works pretty well. If you encounter someone trying to shake you down for btc and they know you have a wallet, find a way to make a decoy or use a Trezor with multiple pass phrases so you can feed them something with a little bit in it to get them to piss off.
@_date: 2019-09-04 16:53:12
There’s nothing to spare you if you blab about how many btc you have and you show them .1.

I use bitfloor, mtgox, vircurex, are a few that will hold your money in USD, and then you can sell them on their market.
@_date: 2013-07-28 09:01:55
I agree.  There's a lot of resistance but a lot of buying power. Eventually it will give way in my speculation. 
@_date: 2013-07-30 12:55:25
I have never had issues.  I do know they ran out of BTC yesterday.  So I bet they're waiting to re-up.
@_date: 2013-08-15 02:40:51
Right now?  It seems like its around 7 dollars invested will get you 10 in return in about 3 months.  The profitability is also declining steadily in my opinion.
Example if you buy 70k in KNC miners youll end up with about 30k profit in a few months at this rate, probably less.  But who wants to put up with trying to manage 70k in mining equipment?
There isn't hardware out there that exists that is super profitable right now.  THe cost to produce the ultra profitable hardware is just too high.
@_date: 2013-12-04 02:32:53
I think it will be like that for now, and maybe for a few more years.  Were still in the early stages of adoption, and I think as the price becomes more stable, and the adoption rate improves, we'll see it less as a cash cow, and more like regular currency.

@_date: 2013-07-25 18:51:31
I noticed this too, you'd be taking a huge risk now buying any mining equipment.  
Here is the reason no one is making any money mining:
People are mining, and most of them are not making any money at all, suffice to say they are LOSING money, doing the mining.
I suppose the idea is that they mine in hopes of collecting coins and that the value will increase.
All of the big players are using their own miners, selling their own miners to people A)Trying to make their money back, and now B)Trying to hold up their IPO's by offering shares of their mining operations.
So unless you have Hundreds of Gigahash right now, you aren't making money, and you wont be in the future unless the diff comes down, and to be honest, I don't see it coming down, rather continuing to increase at current rate.
We now have very large ASIC companies trying to push out product, and really none of them are profitable right now, but because people hope that value of coins will go up, they'll mine anyway.
The original theory was that when mining wasn't profitable, people would stop mining, but that's not happening anymore.
VMC is not profitable, nor is KNCMiners, unless you buy a ton, but then you're spending 70k(i.e 10 Jupiters) to make 30k, which I suppose isnt bad, but thats a lot of work involved.
I would wait to see what KNCMiners comes out with for their Gen2 product.  It will have to be in the TerraHash range in order to keep up at that point.
With all that said, I've personally bought 2 Saturns (Bought end of June), and I'm quite upset over this to be honest. But I think this is more of the same were going to see.  If KNC doesnt make their ship time (which is highly likely at this point), it's going to be a door stop right out the gate.
ASIC technology has created concentrated hash power that is locking everyone else out of the game.  ASIC manufactuers, and other large mining groups are going to continue to use their profits to extend the amount of time they can make money, and squeeze every last bit out of their hardware, and all the while causing the diff to skyrocket.
@_date: 2013-06-30 06:09:36
That's a lot of hoops to jump through, I agree, but if you need coins fast, I know of no other option.
@_date: 2013-08-08 20:39:19
I think maybe he's referring to those of us with extensive bitcoin holdings, and the fact that in the far future, those holdings will be worth quite a bit.  
Here's to hoping for it.

@_date: 2013-07-13 05:25:38
The most you could sell BTC for now on coinbase is less than 5k, however if your bank sees 5k, 5k, 5k appear in your bank account, it will have to report the activity, and THEN you'll have to claim it as income as it will have been reported to the IRS.
@_date: 2013-08-27 02:58:05
Don't.  Buy bitcoins instead.
I had 2 Saturns on preorder and I'm getting a refund.  
Check here if you're not convinced. 
Or wait until KNC Gen 2 Miners come out in March or April.
@_date: 2013-07-30 13:52:17
I would ask their support.
@_date: 2013-08-09 00:07:42
keep an eye on your email, I had BTC within an HR when i used it.
@_date: 2013-07-30 14:32:47
Unless you have 70k to blow on nonexistent hardware, you wont be making much.
By my calculations 70k of KNC Miner equipment will have an ROI in 3 months, plus 30k.  After that your return diminishes quickly.  That is assuming the diff rises 60% per month which is what it did last month.
Only giant investments in mining equipment will work right now.  Unless KNC gen 2 machines are insanely better.
@_date: 2013-07-30 13:54:49
You will just need to fill out paperwork for your large deposits, I would talk to your bank to make sure.  I wouldn't worry about registering as an MSB, since it is all cash exchange.  The bank MAY ask you how you're getting that money though, and then you'll have to come up with some sort of story, or actually register as an MSB.
@_date: 2013-04-13 21:20:13
Also, by then the market will hopefully have cooled down, and the price will settle.  While it looks like its settled already, It appears as if were still in a down turn.
