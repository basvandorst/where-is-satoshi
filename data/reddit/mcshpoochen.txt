I only said it feels manipulated in some sort. That's just my feeling.

It clearly feels manipulated in some sort. Doesn't take a  genius to look at the chart for the last 3 months and see the massive dips and bumps and how one with prior knowledge could profit immensely. Now multiply that with the number of active coins and you can make billions in days.

No, no, you're right. At this point it's just people in panic and multiple chain reactions. Crazy to watch as a HODLer, tbh.

what does it mean to put up a wall? simply the act of raising the order to be far above the current market price?

Thank you for taking the time to explain this to me and others here. I feel I understand the subject much better now and your sorcerer analogy was spot on I feel. Thank you sir.

I'm only just now reading this so sorry for the major delay. Did Litecoin also fork from Bitcoin? Could you explain how forking works in a non malicious way? Thanks!
