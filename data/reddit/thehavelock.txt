Cryptocapital.co get an account, fund it with bitcoin to USD, EUR or GBP through coinapult.com, instantly generate virtual visa card for yourself or anyone else with an email address.

You could use Coinapult's API to covert your coins into fiat, withdraw to your own fiat account with Crypto Capital which is integrated with Coinapult and send those funds to any bank account worldwide with a corporate account for your business.  Loop closed ;)
@_date: 2015-06-16 14:35:34
A corporate account with Crypto Capital is equivalent to a regular bank account, so they wouldn't need to register, all you would need is their banking info to send out funds.  Been using them for the last couple years just to do that.

We are sponsoring a Kick boxing event in Panama where 80% of people are unbanked. We put up the poster for the fight on Monday and we had no impact. Check our submission log. We placed this photo up and did not expect to have such an upvote reaction.  I understand where you come from and the culture in Panama is different from other cultures in Latin America. The fighters will be wearing Bitcoin shirts tomorrow and we are trying to put Bitcoin in front of millions as this will be televised.. Havelock Investments is a sponsor but we are not the one that placed the Bitcoin logo. That's a different Bitcoin company...

I trust them.. They are new on the scene. Fiat via Crypto Capital so you manage your own fiat until you want to trade. Instant Fiat deposit into an exchange and instant withdraw. No need to convert into USD. Good liquidity considering other in the EUR market.
  no in and out fees for fiat. And no trading fees in the same currency.

How could gold be worth anything when people can just mine more? The answer for both gold and bitcoin, there is cost associated with mining both.  Bitcoins are not free to mine. Miners get rewarded with new generated coins for securing and verifying the Bitcoin network.

If someone hacks the private keys from the public keys they wouldn't need to hack Bitcoin, they could hack every Financial transaction and into any bank account in the world.

Interesting read, especially since its from 12/2013. We have more data now and it seems that the patterns are the same just on a longer date range scale between 4/2013 and 12/2013.. This higher we rise the longer the timeframe for the fall.   If we follow the pattern our low should be ~150 and the next rise should take us up to ~2100 before the next drop. ETA ~20-60 days...

Mike, what if XT does not gain enough momentum with 75%, is there a Plan B.  Maybe the mailing list being used to reach a consensus is not the right format and us as a community should sponsor a Bitcoin summit where all the core developers can meet and negotiate a compromise face to face and with all that brain power in one room I'm sure we can work something out.  Sometimes we need that personal touch!

Crypto Capital doesn't actually handle any Bitcoins. It does not buy or sell Bitcoins.  It provides normal Remittance services for their clients. 
The polish authorities never closed any accounts.  The issue with polish banks was that the exchanges just provided their deposit address and many fraudulent transfers were sent to those accounts.  
@_date: 2015-08-04 05:51:19
Fincen treats the bitcoin network as a way to transmit money. So if you buy or sell bitcoins and you are not using a money transmitter to do so then you are the money transmitter.  Yes not great logic, but that is their logic, unfortunately!
Edit: and all MSBs Banks etc are held liable so they get to play cops (snitches) for fincen..  Fincen controls USD, stop using the USD if you don't want to follow their rules!
@_date: 2015-07-24 01:47:58
Crypto Capital is a licensed financial institution, it only handles fiat. The exchanges that are integrated with Crypto Capital are able receive and send funds internally to clients of Crypto Capital which also have an account with Crypto Capital.  Think of it as a Financial Institution which only caters to Crypto clients; individuals, companies and exchanges all in the same banking platform so every transfer is internal and therefore instant.  Private banking for the Crypto economy.  If you have a verified account with Crypto Capital you do not need verification on any of the exchanges integrated with them. They handle all KYC / AML so the exchanges become what they were always supposed to be, software providers; matching engine.
Edit: Also your funds are segregated from the exchange in your own private account. Only when you are ready to you can move your fiat to an exchange instantly, so no long wire delays or high fees.  Withdraw of fiat is instant as well.
