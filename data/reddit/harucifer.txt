He's investigating a gambling scandal involving the game Counter-Strike. There were a lot of sites where you could gamble your ingame items. These items can be sold for real money, so they're like chips in a Casino.
Most gambling sites were shady as fuck, and the biggest "sponsored" known streamers/youtubers. Thing is it turned out these streamers and youtubers were actually owners of those websites. They used their streams and videos to make cool clips of them winning (and in some cases losing) to get views and get people to gamble in their sites. There was no age verification in a ton of them, also, save for some, and the big exception of one website that would verify if "are you older than **13**?"

Segwit failed to be implemented (wallet devs need to do the work and they're not willing to, its essentially a fail). LN is still under development and Im not even sure it'll fix the issues without giving life to many more. Devs fail to do a temp-fix to the delays and high fees problem (we weren't even supposed to have fees while miners still get block rewards), so smart money jumped boat at 19.5-20k and is waiting for the issues to settle.
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:44:41
No. And that is the problem.
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:45:57
So its value is 100% speculation huh
@_date: 2017-12-24 19:33:16
But it always made sense to use on-chain transactions while off-chain solutions are not ready.

Yeah well, one word question: when? You dont remedy cancer by saying "we are working on a cure!" and ignore other possible treatments. You use them to prolong the patients life whilist working on the cure. This is what Blockstream are refusing to do. Paying 15$ for a small transaction is pointless.
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:14:47
@_date: 2017-12-18 14:50:04


Why would you assume Im not?


A blocksize increase hardfork would:
 * Decrease/kill off BCH
 * Doesnt depend on exchanges or wallet providers to implement new tech (like Segwit depends)
 * Clear the mempool fairly quickly causing transactions to be faster and fees to drop freefall.
From all the benefits of writing one line of code, on something 90%+ miners wanted to begin with (S2X), I dont think it would be much of a hassle. Its a low risk high reward move.
@_date: 2017-12-15 18:31:56

@_date: 2017-12-21 15:18:10
Lightning is already too late. BTC is on its way to the grave unless theres a fix for these ridiculous fees and delays. Its nothing but a store of value, and its only a store of value because its speculatively on the rise, and its only speculatively on the rise because it had some crazy bullruns. Theyre stopping. Look to cahs out or go into alts.

@_date: 2017-12-14 21:12:40
What the fuck is this, Lobotomy city? SWITCH to alt coins? We lose the crytptowar if we do that. The only thing BTC has over SEVERAL alt coins is its brand name and value. DASH, ETH, BCH all got better working tech at the moment. If we switch, those two become irrelevant, and alt coins boom in value. There will be no point to ever switch back because altcoins will have either better or similar level of technology and either better or similar value. Im seriously considering moving permanently to either Ethereum or Dash.

AFAIK its literally one line of code that needs to change. Or be removed, since the original code didn't account for a 1mb limit.

Well I've had some people "defending" Bitcoin by saying "use alts if you want low fees". That's gotta be the most retarded shit I've seen in this sub. "Help Bitcoin grow by using alts!"
@_date: 2017-12-14 23:32:03
But at the very least it does scale better than BTC with 1mb blocks.
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:24:25
Rofl its not the exchanges/wallets fault. Cant just say "hey Segwit is availiable, implement it at your own discretion". Of course people are gonna resist working on something like this.

Also managed to time it perfectly. Sodl at 18200 because someone (a trader I follow) called for a dip/correction to 16800. Was planning to rebuy at 17200 IF the mempool was clearing but it didn't even reach that and started bleeding out whilist the mempool clogged up even further. Imma stay away until the mempool issue is solved, otherwise BTC is just speculation.

See you got your head so far up your ass youre legit saying "get out of BTC" and promoting an altcoin. You should be wishing for more poeple to be using BTC in favor of alts, not the opposite. If the tech cant take it, it needs adjustments. Thats obvious.

@_date: 2017-12-26 16:52:29
Minus fees tho
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:33:46
Actually its a matter of weeks for Bitcoin to suffer tremendously. If we can get +160% in a month, we can also lose 90%+ in the same time frame because of less adoption and people jumping ship.
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:43:26
Tag the fucking devs
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:32:22
Letting the mempool clog up further, increasing fees and delays on transactions, is also destructive. Either we do a "shortsighted and destructive solution" that alleviates the mempool and also helps increase adoption by handling the huge amount of new users or we KEEP facing a destructive situation.

You need at least 6900 karma otherwise they tell you to post a video fisting yourself. And they wont hire you.
@_date: 2017-12-24 21:30:31
Except its different. Miners were singnaling for 2X. Even though it had shitty code (reason I was against it) and didnt even work when shit came to shove, miners had 90%+ intention of doubling blocksize. If done, no one would have to implement technicalities to their wallets to make use of the change, unlike Segwit. Doubling blocksize would probably have huge miner support, would kill/severly damage BCH, clear the mempool which would solve transaction confirmation delays and achieve lower fees. The network would finally be able to breathe in a while, and give devs the time they need to implement LN. Would also stop people (and by that I mean idiots) of suggestion switching to alt coins for small transactions. Oh and it would cease adoption dropping.
It would be a winning move by every definition possible. And when LN is ready and working we could reduce the blocksize again. 
Also increasing blocks to 2mb or even 4mb wouldnt lead to any sort of centralization whatsoever.
@_date: 2017-12-15 22:46:26
Its one thing to rush, its another to take so fucking long the chain dies. Devs need to step on the fucking gas and start doing things already. 150k unconfirmed transactions, fees at 10$-15$ cannot be the norm.
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:23:24

You're a poet. Would you like to read my Roger Ver Adam Back fanfic? Maybe you could write a poem about it.
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:58:20
Thats a no for me. I believe in the future of cryptocurrency, not BTC specifically. The mempool bomb is ticking hard and devs arent responding to it in a timely manner. Its got to a point where BTC has literally no value other than being a store of value, and its only a store of value because of speculation that it will one day be useful again. It also got to a point BTC holders are suggesting using other cryptos "if you want fast and cheap transfers". Thats a big red flag to me and proves BTC is useless at the moment. If I have to use alts, might aswell store value in them. At least Ill save a few bucks in fees. Ill wait for the day BTC is usefull again before I rebuy in. By then I also expect BTC wont be the number one marketcap cryptocurrency and will be MySpaced into irrelevancy.

I disagree. Monitor the mempool for a week or two and keep an eye for those transfer fees. Short term "safe" as people still blindly believe thats not a problem, mid-term extremely unsafe as people realize that, long term uncertain depending on when LN is released and if is it any good and adopted fast.
@_date: 2017-12-12 23:19:11
Reminder that the fee and delay problems would easily be solved with one line of code allowing BTC to have 2mb blocks. And this could be temporary while LN gets ready.
@_date: 2017-12-19 13:24:16


Do you know the implications of what you're suggesting? If everyone switched 50% of their value in BTC to alt coins BTC's price would literally tank 50%. And alts would rise. Whats the point of BTC then, if it loses the only advantage (higher value thanks to first move advantage) it has over alts? Im finding myself almost flipping to ETH or DASH, maybe even BCH (even though I hate Roger and Jihan and the centralization they represent), and if I do Im surely never going back to BTC. Cant use it because of high fees and delay anyways.
@_date: 2017-12-19 17:54:50
Yeah well, I dont see the situation getting any better so I cashed out. Still got some money left in a few alts.
@_date: 2017-12-25 14:46:14
Thats altcoin promoting and you should be banned. If youre in favor of Bitcoin you should NEVER be suggesing using alts. 
You know thats how MySpacing into irreelevancy begins, right? "Ohh MySpace doesnt have X features but this Facebook thingy does.

@_date: 2017-12-27 20:46:33
Powerful mental gymnastics here. Allow me to retort:
 * We dont have Segwit because the relevant wallet providers didnt implement it yet.
 * We dont have LN because its not released and relevant wallet providers didnt implement it yet.

Its a better coin for everyday transactions. No high fees and no delays.
@_date: 2017-12-12 23:22:27
Oh great, cant wait for my payment to be pending forever unless I want to pay an extra 10$ in fees.
@_date: 2017-12-14 22:24:00
Then I will try to explain what I think will happen if a huge number of people follows your advice.
 * Say 50% of BTC holders decide to sell right now and go for altcoins while LN is getting ready. 
 * BTC marketcap, currently around 2/3s of the crypto market cap, would drop by 50% and price would essentially tank to 8500.
 * Now those 50% of BTCs market cap flows to alts. Lets say theyll be focused 40% between Ripple, Dash, ETH and BCH, while the other 10% dilutes into minor alts.
 * This means essentially each of those coins would get on average 10% of BTCs marketcap. Meaning about 25billion each.
 * ETH rises its market cap and price by about 30%, reaching 1000 per unit.
 * Ripple rises its market cap by about 50%, reaching 1.5 per unit.
 * DASH rises its market cap by 300%, reaching 3600 per unit.
 * BCH rises its market cap by ~75%, reaching 3300 per unit.
 * FUD and FOMO take place, more people sell bitcoin and abandon the boat, fleeing to alts. BTC is now the MySpace of cryptocurrencies and is on its way to the grave while price tanks further. Then in a year from now LN is ready but all you hear is crickets because nobody cares about BTC, a 2500 dollar cryptocurrency with devs so slow they lost their dominance of the market thanks to incompetency.
All those coins also have better scaling or potential for scaling. Dash has a shit load of cash in their fund.
How is this good for Bitcoin?
Also Id love to see you explain WHY people would flee back to Bitcoin if alts are working for them. Make no mistake: the only advantages BTC has over many alts is just brand name (btc ticker) and huge value. Those can, and will, become irrelevant with developer inaction,
@_date: 2017-12-19 13:20:00
Ill tell you what would happen: BCH loses a lot of value. BTC is now reusable in everyday transactions. BTC adoption goes up like crazy because of this, and so does the value. Its a winning move in every aspect you look at. But no, lets be retards and keep cheering for LN to arrive just in time to keep BTC from being completely useless for anything but speculation.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:26:31
Watching the price drop about 2k after I sold. You?
@_date: 2017-12-19 17:10:00
BTC is literally useless for anything other than store of value at the moment. And its only a store of value 100% because of speculation. Devs not moving a finger about the fees seems to indicate a potential crisis soon.
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:06:15
In crypto? Possibly less than 6 months.
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:46:32
Slow ass devs.
@_date: 2017-12-19 13:34:30


So you're essentially saying that, right now, we rather have few people on-chain than billions of people on-chain.  You're essentially against BTC gaining adoption. I for one would love BTC blocksize to keep growing as the userbase grows. We can shrink blocks later if necessary and if the tech allows it (Schnorr signatures and whatever else helps). Thing is: right now we need something to be done. And I don't think anything will be done because Blockstream are either compromised or idiots.
@_date: 2017-12-19 13:26:32
No it wouldn't take 2 years. It would be fast. Miners wanted S2X because of double block size and it had over 90% signaling. If Blockstream suggests a block size increase I figure miners would jump on it asap. Value would also increase a lot, and BCH would lose relevancy.
@_date: 2017-12-19 13:35:30
It was. Then fees got astronomical.
@_date: 2017-12-25 00:01:15

Congrats on doing this, you sound like an amazing person.
@_date: 2017-12-24 22:43:06
Yeah well I dont spend over $1000 on a daily basis. I spend $5-$50, plus $100-500 in a few separete transactions every month. No point paying $10 to $50 in fees and having to wait hours/days for that. I want to pay for my coffee with Bitcoin as well as the occasional big purchases. Unless bitcoin can handle that, its gonna be losing adoption. We've already seen that with Steam and Bitpay.
I seriously dont understand people going around suggesting the non-use of Bitcoin in favor of legacy payment systems and sometimes even fucking altcoins. Thats essentially cheering for Bitcoin to be less significant, thinking youre doing bitcoin a favor.
My Visa confirms payments almost instantly. I pay $0 in fees (at least directly, one could argue it drives product prices up) since its up for sellers to pay for that. The only problem is a spending/withdraw limit, but for everyday purchases that never affects me, and since I dont do overseas $50k transactions more than once in my lifetime, why would I favor Bitcoin over my Visa card? The "cons" of bitcoin are severly damaging adoption. I bailed out at 18200 when I saw mempool hitting 250k unconfirmed transactions with people suggesting alts. No way thats sustainable. Will cash in again in alts in a few weeks while I wait for the shitshow to settle.
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:28:38
You underestimate the huge porblem of transaction fees and delays. A temporary solution is a solution nonetheless. And even if it causes usage to increase thanks to new users joining the boat, isnt that EXACTLY what we want? More adoption? Then why the fuck would we not do something that goes in that direction? Not to mention if BTC increases blocksize people would have less and less reason to use BCH.
@_date: 2017-12-14 20:39:38
Yeah I've done that about 2-3 weeks ago. My fraction of btc sits in a fiat-backed (meaning no Tether) exchange that I can cash out asap.
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:59:43
The fact youre even suggesting an alt for anything is proof enough of the promblem bitcoin is facing.

And when you build something and wait it adopted by others, you need to make it as easy as 123. Implementing Segwit in wallets doesnt seem like its as easy as 123 and is why exchanges are not doing it. Developers are at fault for trusting others to do their work.

@_date: 2017-11-02 21:44:36
GUESS WHO BABY WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
@_date: 2017-11-11 20:35:27


For what Ive seen, they actually do. What I'm extremely worried about is the number of unconfirmed transactions (currently at 127k) on the BTC blockchain. This is unreal and unheard of. Devs really need to do something about those, and the fastest and safest way would be a blocksize increase. S2X was a shitty code and possibly a conspiracy for what we're seeing right now, but the block increase is very much needed.
Make no mistake about this, the BTC chain might die or get severly damaged (value-wise). BCH is now extremely more profitable to mine, and will be so for at least Nov 13, when BCH difficulty will be adjusted. BTC difficulty adjustment is weeks away.
If devs don't do something RIGHT NOW (it should've been done as soon as BCH started mooning to ~700) we might indeed witness a flippening/chain death. Im keeping my shit in Exchanges so I can fastly trade and avoid a chain death with a stop-limit. You should do that too.
@_date: 2017-11-11 15:32:25
Good point. But meanwhile unconfirmed transactions are literally going to the moon. Let us hope the difficulty adjustment makes both coins mineable and the prices stagnate. But best case scenario I see BTC dropping to 5k and BCH possibly meeting it around there.

Long time lurker here. Never posted a thing, just been reading a lot for a while (a bit over a year) so take my word as you wish.
The market is speaking.
In light of S2X cancellation, BTC is in a huge dip (from 7800 to 6500) in less than 24 hours, while the alternative (don't need to name it, we all know it) is up over 70%.
Why is this happening? People who wanted bigger blocks were sticking around and hoping for the S2X fork. The fork would literally kill off one chain, either S1X or S2X. Miners would have 3 options, and the most likely scenario would be 33% of miners mining each chain. Without an Emergency Difficulty Adjustment in place, both S1X and S2X would be overwhelmed, while the other coin would quickly adjust. One of the chains would quickly die, and the surviving, damaged chain (from this hash brawl) would have to face the alternative coin next. Things would not look good.
However since the fork was cancelled, whoever wanted bigger blocks just jumped to the alternative coin. Whoever wanted faster confirmations and jumped to the alternative coin. Whoever wanted lower fees jumped to the alternative coin. And miners, obviously, see the alternative coin as a better long term mining solution (since LN is still way down the road, making the alternative coin a better option for everyday use). And now from this rise in price, make no mistake about this, the alternative coin is becoming viral. You know when the crazy bull run started early this year and the price shot up straight to 7k? Thats precisely what's happening with the alternative coin. And now miners won't jump out of it simply because its a lot more profitable now, so the number of BTC unconfirmed transactions will go higher and higher. 
There are things BTC devs can do to combat this "flippening" (that I actually doubted would ever happen, but we might just be witnessing it) and/or chain death: 
 * Implement a fucking EDA/PoW so miners can switch back and forth as they please.
 * Increase the fucking blocksize so blocks aren't congested. This is a SHORT TERM SOLUTION of course, but its a much needed one. Then take your time to develop LN all you want, but something needs to be done asap.

We're in the middle of a small dip (5800 to 5500ish) so now might be a good time
