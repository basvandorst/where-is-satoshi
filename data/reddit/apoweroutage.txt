No the creation of BCC has you beat as the first crypto joke. Sorry man

It's correct. I was wrong in my explanation. Short term capital gains are taxed at your normal rate like you said, but long term capital gains are taxed at a special rate which is almost always lower. It makes sense to hold for longer than a year because you could end up even paying 0 on those gains depending on your typical bracket.

Investment taxes are notoriously convoluted. If btc is treated like a typical investment which I'm not actually sure it is? It seems to be the common belief that it is taxed that way at least. Read up on short term vs long term capital gains, it may help with other investments in the future as well

Absolutely wrong. You need to calculate a cost basis for your purchase. By saying that all 17.5 you put in was  extracted that means you will pay no taxes now but your future withdrawal assuming you do eventually exchange for fiat has a cost basis of zero meaning you got it free. You will be better off spreading it out rather than paying all the taxes later. 
For perspective. If I sell stock that has doubled in price I don't report that I broke even if I only sell half, I report the increase from the initial purchase price to the price I sold on only the shares that I sold.
Also since it was bought and sold in under one year you will need to pay short term capital gains.

Of course. On the public computers, that's where I keep my wallet. Nobody would ever think to look there

Other way around. You will pay short term capital gains for selling under one year

No way that amateur non institutional traders could accomplish that. Everyone in this sub can hype each other all they want, but remember you are the minority in this space

This comment is why I question the future success of bitcoin. Face. Palm

Told my dad to buy me a Hellcat Challenger, could have really paid off for him. I might have let him ride in it. Poor sap

Without mass acceptance, they/we all have to do this. They need to pay suppliers, bills, employees, etc.

Good luck not supporting Bitmain. mining would be nothing if it weren't for the ASIC machines they make.

Who has two thumbs and would absolutely do that with their 401k it weren't being done through coinbase? This guy.

Don't risk what you can't afford to lose.

In order for you to buy someone has to sell, so you should all be thankful that people do sell. I sold, too much hype to justify the risk. No sure what the fork will truly do, so for now I'm taking my profits and happy with it. 
I like the theory of bitcoin but I fear that people and govts will fuck it up. Banks weren't always bad, until people got greedy

What people seem to forget is what large corporations would do with Bitcoin if they were to take it as a form of payment. Amazon would get destroyed by shareholders if they started accepting it. It's far to risky for a company that is far too large. All they would do is sell it off, which in turn would not bode will for Bitcoin

In case you didn't see the other 4 people respond, that apparently didn't see the other 3, 2, or 1 people/person respond already. It's Instagram

A call or put order in the stock market is a contract for 100 shares of stock. Multiply you're answer by 100.
