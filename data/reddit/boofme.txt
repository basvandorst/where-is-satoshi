so the one time setup and I won't need to use a pc after the one setup is complete? Can I transfer and receive funds still?

@_date: 2018-01-10 18:31:18
I don't believe that's not compatible with an Android device... 
@_date: 2018-01-10 18:56:49
I have the budget I think I'm gonna go with the trezor since it is truly compatible with Android and its water/damage proof. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 18:49:13
which one do you recommend and do I need to use a pc to setup because I don't have one 
@_date: 2018-01-10 19:07:10
ohhhh wow TREZOR has won me over! Thanks for the help friend.

Wow so funny man good one 
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:10:03
I just read reviews on Play Store and that's by far one of the worst. So many people are frustrated with the app it seems... 
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:06:18
it's a meme 
@_date: 2017-12-24 02:23:13

Any mobile mining you recommend. I plan on building a PC in the coming weeks and plan on mining through that but until now I'm stuck on mobile. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 01:22:32
how long did it take to earn that amount 
@_date: 2017-12-24 01:36:02
I'd suggest use amd because of the better hash rates if you're gonna mine. I do like Nvidia for strictly gaming though. I plan on buildijg a 4k gaming rig with a gtx 1080 titan. ��������
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:12:07

@_date: 2017-12-07 03:56:56
I plan on leaving my rig on for most of the day. I also plan on putting 3-4k into it so it'll be pretty op. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 01:20:02
damn Im assuming he owns 40 of the fuckers...
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:59:50
it's mainly gonna be for gaming/mining/ do you recommend amd ryzen still or Nvidia. I'm more towards the Nvidia because of all the monitor syncs/in game software ect. ect. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:59:45

@_date: 2017-12-18 00:52:54

@_date: 2017-12-24 01:24:28

@_date: 2017-12-24 01:27:51
I'm probably just better off actually mining for the coin sense amd has extremely good hash rates. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 01:53:14
Can we exchange thru a website or a safe way of doing it because I still need help or even if you help me find a website with  somewhat of a low exchange rate I'll tip you some btc for helping me!!!
@_date: 2017-12-24 01:38:41
just posted they denied it
@_date: 2017-12-24 04:03:56
i was literally sitting there on Googles btc chart that's updated every second every minute every hour and I was checking in every 30mins I do it constantly because I'm always buying and trading and try to get the most bank for my bitcoin...  if the graphs says cool but I don't see no numbers that prove the drawing 
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:55:31
thought yall said my meme wasn't good enough now it's back up yall trolling me af
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:24:12
yea I saw some of the reviews on Play Store. Do they take personal information how does the sign up work? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:45:19
are the fees high if I wanna cashout I just read some reviews people made reports of the app crashing even on the latest phones. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:47:48
I was able to buy more presents for my family with the extra btc I earned so thankful maybe this is a Christmas miracle the coin value is gonna go extremely low everyones gonna buy with there Holiday/tax money and booooom we gonna double or triple in a month again who knows.. cheers happy holidays. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:42:26
Will the fees eventually go down and what percentage or amount do they take out? I tend to move around often but I'm willing to stay loyal. When I get a large enough amount after awhile I plan on cashing out.. so I don't wanna lose a shit load of coin. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:02:59
check out your app store!
@_date: 2017-12-24 01:17:12
does it matter? this isn't helping... 
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:32:10
what's makes coinomi so good? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:23:33
read that one is terrible too... I think I'm gonna stick with BitPay it seems user friendly has a decent layout as well. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 02:12:49
as I said above I live in a small town we don't even have a Walmart or any stores and there sure as hell isn't one of those near me... 
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:08:19
Sorry if I'm asking a lot of questions but I'm intrigued by the information you've been providing me master. lmao. How long do deposits take on BitPay? I'm transfer from another wallet. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 01:55:55
I'm looking for btc not another gift card.... 
@_date: 2017-12-24 02:14:50
doesn't help 
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:37:49
so it supports Ethereum, Litecoins? 
@_date: 2017-12-24 02:19:23
what's that 
@_date: 2017-12-24 01:57:36
it didn't even go down to 12k lowest was 13k for an hour or so...  trust me I watched it all day it mostly stayed at 14 and 15k like it's at rn �� 
@_date: 2017-12-24 02:18:55
hAHa so so funnnnNy
@_date: 2017-12-24 02:20:43

@_date: 2018-02-12 20:10:30
Ohh really so there’s no software that’s if need to download to setup it works straight out of the box? I was told I had to setup once on pc and then it’ll work mobile
@_date: 2018-02-12 20:49:05
I do have android devices but there’s no way to hook my trezor up to my iPhone and use mycelium to send funds to friends? Can I put the funds from my mycelium wallet on my trezor when connected and then put funds from my trezor onto my mycelium wallet?
@_date: 2018-02-12 20:55:59
I just found something called a ledger blue and it’s a touchscreen wallet that works on every phone and platform 
@_date: 2018-02-12 20:43:48
The guy above said it would work everywhere and I could setup on my phone ?? Should tell him not to provide false information. Thanks for the help.
@_date: 2018-02-12 21:14:35
Yeah it sure is expensive but well worth it in my opinion you can store multiple alt coins on it.
