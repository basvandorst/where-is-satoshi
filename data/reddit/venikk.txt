It’s more likely linked to the fact that mdma literally causes brain damage. Try shrooms instead which actually creates brain cells. Still a risk of depersonalization though.

It appears you expect everyone has a photographic memory. Can you tell me the 23rd president off the top of your head? Or the headline of your local newspaper on Nov 23rd 2010? That's about how old the newsletters were when they were brought up for the first time in 1996.
I remember enough about the newsletters to know anyone who thinks they are an issue is an idiot. I fully researched and debated this many times, argued against every angle, and none of them make any sense. The liar one is not new, and still not valid. 
Again, you are the liar. Making arguments up against Ron Paul, a fucking saint, that have nothing to do with anything. Just completely outrageous arguments.

I have read them, two years ago. 
I'd rather a doctor, be like 99% of other doctors, and spend time helping and healing people than reading and writing his own newsletter.
Obama hired Malik hassan and Ivan Lopez. They wore his uniform, they pledged their allegiance, and they took orders from his officers. By your logic, Obama is responsible for both fort hood shootings.
Fun game isn't it? To pin people for something their employee did? 
Doesn't fucking make any sense either, does it?
You don't know that he knew what was in them, how can you catch someone in a lie if you don't know the truth? In fact how could he know what was in them 15 years after a monthly news letter had already been published? That's an impressive memory!
 I still have yet to hear him say "I knew what was in them" Or "I didn't know what was in them." This evasive phrase, you keep repeating seems to suggest that it exists somewhere. In fact you are making it up. You are more of a liar than Ron Paul. Ron Paul is a fucking saint, in the top .00001% of morality of this country. He is not a liar. Reporters are generally in the bottom .00001%.
@_date: 2014-07-06 20:28:46


Then why does it matter what is in them, if he didn't write them. Is a 5 star general responsible for the fort hood shooting? Is UCSB responsible for the IV shooting? Am I responsible for Obama's undeclared wars? You are blaming someone for something they didn't do, out of their control, who fired said individual. What the fuck is wrong with you?
Better support world war three over someone who hired a racist, right? Fucking ingenius, you must have gone to harvard!
He didn't defend them, he was caught off guard by a political assassination and still won the election. He tried to and failed to use the right words to defend himself. His words were then taken out of context by the hired reporter. Did you once hear him say he stands by what "he wrote"? No, that is not what the dallas news quoted. They took a bunch of phrases of him trying to prove himself as not a racist, and plugged them into the worst place possible.
Never trust a reporter, they are paid to make people look bad for idiots like yourself. Judge someone by what they say not by the context the reporter uses. 
FYI I'm an engineer, and a pianist, two of the dumbest things in the world.
@_date: 2014-07-06 11:13:14
Like I thought, there is absolutely no new information here. Ron Paul's "signature" was on the newsletter, that does not mean he wrote it. He was a practicing OBGYN at the time. Do you have any friends that are doctors? They don't have time to pick up the phone let alone write, or even read or edit a newsletter. 
Even if any of those quotes are true, they don't explain anything. But why should we even believe they are trueto begin with, if the Dallas News can't even get the fact straight that Ron Paul did not write anything?
Is it racist to recite facts from a study on african americans in DC? Aren't all teenagers swift footed? Who would steal a purse from someone faster than them? The criminal justice system unequivocally targets black males, a fact that Ron Paul uses as a talking point. That is what he's citing as "What dc laughingly calls the criminal justice system". Suddenly the comment is the exact opposite of racism. Context is nice isn't it?

Mt Gox is only one "owner" of all these bitcoins. There is one entity which has more bitcoin than them at the time of the study. Who the fuck is/was that?
How do you explain bitcoins being spread out to numerous wallets, then returned within the hour?
How do you explain that only 2 million bitcoins are in circulation when 9 million have been mined?
You need more specifics here than "rife with questionable assumptions and misunderstandings about how Bitcoin works". That's not a quantitative analysis that's **pure rhetoric**. And so is the link you supplied. The fact that you and the developer can't counter any specifics of the article and study tells me that you don't know the answer, and that the accusations hold water.

@_date: 2013-11-20 03:12:58
Early comers own more than half of all the bitcoins, a very small minority. They will be getting 'out' as they see fit, when they need a car, when they buy a house, when they want some new hardware or appliance, etc. This could go on for years before the distribution evens out, if ever. Each time they spend it or sell out, the market 'sees' their currency and the value of bitcoin dips. My guess is that before the distribution evens out, retailers will have moved on to a more stable coin. Bitcoins will be valuable still, but no one will want them, too expensive. No one will sell them because they love them, no one will take them because they can't be spent or bought cheaply. Liquidity is what kills a deflationary currency. If it ever becomes obvious that bitcoin is getting phased out, it's value could evaporate over night.
@_date: 2013-03-21 20:16:14

You are mentally ill, kid. Your worldview is seriously depressing. You should stop telling people not to dream, and start dreaming yourself. You're not helping anyone, especially not yourself.

Who said I'm unable? I chose not to. If I used google to learn about petroleum engineering or economics, my two specialties, I wouldn't learn a damn thing. I'd get a lot of "dollar good, yen bad" balony, I'd get a lot of "oil is dying" balony. I could list a hundred things that I would 'learn' from google that would be completely false, and generally told by laymen who 'think' they understand both. 


Like tackling a source code alone???


The entire universe can be explained with math, so yes, math is important. You can program without math, but if you don't understand math your programming **goals** will be bad. I.e. a stagnant supply of currency = deflation = nonlinear derivative. Maybe if the bitcoin creators understood both first year calculus, and first year economics, they would've created a currency that was more stable. Then again 90% of people who take those two classes never put them together and forget it all in a year, because they never use it again.

You realize that makes your point about finding supporters even less true? If someone as great as Einstein had 0 supporters, then why would I need them? And economics is practically a psuedoscience, so I wouldn't agree that cryptocurrencies is a finished science or even an established science.


While a little tongue in cheek the answer Hello World is exactly what you needed.
It might turn out that I only need to 'snipe' a few lines of code in/out, and reconnect some lines. I'm going to edit the code, not create a new one. And where do you get the idea that I've never written a program? I've written lots of programs, some java, some on my TI calc, some in simple english instructions for boots on the ground, some in matlab, some in pspice. 
Didn't we talk about making assumptions? Jesus Christ...


Do the words lost in translation mean anything to you? I'm not going to have to 'learn' C++. I only need to read, and hopefully just change details. I'm not creating a program from scratch here. If it turns out that I do have to learn the language, why the fuck not? It's not like my goal is to learn nothing from this.


That's stupid. At the very least i would make the supply of the coin increase exponentially rather than inversely.

I have to know the details of the system in order to know what ways my goals could be accomplished.
So far you have not made one correct assumption. I'm not in this "for the money" any more than anyone else. What a stale accusation. Besides, I have plenty of money. And I'm more interested in accomplishing something, let alone possibly giving the world it's first stable currency.

You keep implying that I'm bitter that I didn't get in soon enough. It's the opposite. I'm bitter that nobodies going to get out soon enough. There's a huge difference between the two.
Any currency increases in value when currency disappears. It also loses value when currency is created. That's the entire point (or supposed to be) behind bitcoin - is that eventually no currency will be created. Whereas the amount of any other currency is constantly being inflated. In mainstream economics it's called the quantity theory of money. Disagree with it all you want, it's not going to convince me that the theory is wrong.
According to that article, only 2 million of the 9 million bitcoins actually circulate. And 7 entities own atleast 20% of all bitcoins. The article cites Adi Shamir's study on bitcoin, who is a world-renowned cryptographer.
I wish you'd stop arguing with rhetoric and fluff, and actually contribute to the debate.

Who says you can only have one wallet? The fact that there are numerous wallets with nice round numbers that haven't been used in years and only one transaction history only worries me more. Is that ok with you? That I have an opinion and feelings?
Looking at the mining curve, it's logarithmic. The first miners (and the creators) either own a significant amount of bitcoins, or spent them all. IIRC half of all bitcoins were mined in the first year and half. 
Past performance doesn't predict future results. As we learned in the tulip bubble, the south sea bubble, the dot com bubble, etc.
I make returns elsewhere, where I feel comfortable. Bitcoin isn't the only thing that increased in value in the past year. It's recent performance warrants investigation, which is what I'm doing. So far it's looking like I should buy the next dip (when the early miners get out) and watch it soar and pop in the meanwhile.
@_date: 2013-04-12 08:56:00
I think a better copycat will pop up. One that doesnt:
* unfairly reward early miners and the founders (this creates volatility each time one of them enters the market)
* Updates more often
* Make it almost impossible to catch theives
I think bitcoin will be like what myspace was to social media. The idea still has alot of evolving to do. And now that bitcoin is mainstream, it's too late for it to evolve itself very drastically.

Clearly the question I asked was too far beyond your comprehending ability. Judging by the fact that you still haven't answered it.
It's a simple question, for what should be a straightforward answer, I didn't ask for a book. 
Does the bitcoin or does it not provide incentive to mine more as more transactions need to be processed.
It looks like to me the answer is no, and you have trouble simply stating that.

Lol... Are you sure there isn't an altcoin that doesn't allow ASICs? I'm pretty sure there is. 
I don't know why you're saying my idea isn't going to work, when you cannot possibly know what my idea is. I would be interested to know how you came up with my idea before I did? hahahaha. 
And how would I come up with an idea if I haven't even seen the source code? hahaha....
So if you don't know my idea, and I don't know my idea, you're critiquing an altcoin that doesn't exist...hahahaha...
I have a goal for an altcoin, not an idea. The goal is to make one that doesn't have the volatility involved with early-comers, and one that also isn't deflationary (or inflationary). There could be a thousand ways to implement that depending on what I learn, studying altcoins and other currencies.
Again, it's pointless to argue about something that doesnt even exist yet. That's why I'm not here to argue, I'm here to find the best source of knowledge for creating an altcoin. And I doubt google is going to tell me that btw. And even if it did I'd rather hear it from experts, not a do-it-all search engine that can't tell me a damn thing about my very own field.

Almost no one understand the deflationary spiral. There are millions perhaps that **think** they understand it, but they don't. 
A deflationary spiral is only possible in a debt-based fractional reserve banking system. It's caused by money literally disappearing from existence. Since money is debt, paying off debt forces banks to liquidate assets, which in turn makes debt more expensive, which makes debtors pay off their debt, which makes banks liquidate assets, which makes debt more expensive, which makes debtors pay off their debt, which makes banks liquidate assets...it's a positive feedback loop. 
I would argue that real money isn't money unless it is increasing in value. I would argue that bubbles only exist because people are trying to find an asset to play the role of money. I would argue that money has a much deeper purpose than a yardstick by which to measure value. It's a reward to society for not using resources, you are paid for your chastity in increased value for every unit of time you hold that currency. Money hasn't existed since 1913, it was legislated out of existence. It was banned from being privately owned in 1934. Real money could be anything, it could be gold, silver, bitcoin, etc. But it has to increase in value, it has to be liquid, it has to be abundant, and it has to be legally recognizable as currency.

I didn't want to google it, I thought I explained that. Why is that a problem? I'm looking for books and guides not websites or wikipedia. People are better 'search engines' than google.
I have respect for programmers that don't talk to anyone who isn't like they're an idiot. I probably studied 10x more math and science than most programmers, programming is just another science. Everyone takes their own approach to things, and just because I didn't do the "one thing" you think someone should do when they need help, doesn't mean I'm stupid. 
Sounds like you have an informal education on programming, from google. And I have to say it's by far not the best way to learn. Everything I learned in school is still unavailable from google or youtube. The best way to get information is from people, not a search engine. And I honestly think it's extremely naive to think any different. Google is not a substitute for a teacher or an expert (i.e. bitcoin subbers).
