To be fair ... most of us "early adopters" knew nothing about investments as well.
The big difference was the fiat cost of mistakes were relatively low.

Yeah totally different than a corporation that's behind ripple premining every single block and then keeping 60% of the coins for themselves. Yeah bitcoin must be the scam.

Such an immaturity level here .... is correct, if it takes a couple of years to recover the time-value cost of money is a bitter pill to swallow.
@_date: 2018-01-18 11:01:40
It's debatable, depends on your needs for the capital (which is the point of time-value). If you don't need it, then yeah let it ride. If you do need it, time to pull it out.

OP you want IRS form 8949. 
Take every transaction log you want to give the IRS to a Tax dude, I am going to do that for mine this year, there's some FIFO (first in first out) reporting and a few other issues that I don't feel comfortable doing by myself for the first time. 
REMEMBER your wallet ID IS YOU in this case, it's pretty trivial to see transactions for your wallet. ;-)

Exactly. I am amazed at how many buy orders are on GDAX given the movement downward. This is actually probably taking longer than it should. 
Check out the ADX charts ... This is not stopping anytime soon. Give it a few days.

RemindMe! 2 months "will be buying BTC at 2k per coin"

Well bought in at 19,750 why wouldn't he buy in when it's cheaper? It's on sale. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:27:19
Actually that is a fine investment strategy, buy high and sell higher.
It has a lot to do with market direction and the overall crypto market.
@_date: 2018-01-18 10:59:42
No I am one of those assholes that bought BTC when it hit $1000 the first time. Buy high and sell higher.
Maybe you should actually read about some investment strategies. In a trending upward market, this is a perfectly sensible strategy. [

Sure you can time the market ... just wait until your favorite exchange goes down due to traffic. That's the best time to sell!
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:13:27
Well you could possibly control the asset at the time of the chain split. NOT when Coinbase "released" the funds.

It honestly depends on how many jobs are eventually created or destroyed via automation if UBI is good or bad.
It's a big change in how we work and value goods, there's no argument there.
But hey even in Star Trek, they still used gold (pressed-latnum) to do some transactions.

Thanks for the reference!

Waiting is different than being ready for a probable outcome.
And it's people like (and me) that try to cushion the bottom for hodlers. In a way we are shorting the currency by being ready.

Citi Bank did an analysis: 
If you keep BTC on the books it's a risk, because of the relative volatility, and reflects poorly on your investors.
If you flip the bit(coin) quickly to USD(or other fiats), and are not carrying BTC long term, you show revenue.

Hahahah the libertarian chickens have come home to roost.
Next thing you'll be asking for government regulation of bitcoin pools.
How are you going to tell someone they can't make money and provide a service at the same time?

I like your thoughts but I think you severly limit the audience of any media by calling them *consumers*. You do not *consume* ideas, part of you (and part of the audience) *becomes* that idea.
For example; Authors have long recognized that their stories are only half (at best) of a narrative, the audience determines the other half (or more) of the story. Modern analysis even suggests that the authors biography (even if unwritten) supports the only context in which motivations and structure can be correctly interpenetrated. I digress ...
Using the term *consume* completely removes the audience from the *idea*. It's as if we (the audience) have no say in what we feel or what we do as a result of those feelings. We are being spoon fed.
The audience is as much responsible for the narrative as the author. *Consumption* removes the audience from the work, and it makes us a fool to spend money on an idea that we can neither expand upon nor develop further.
This is why the Copyright Laws and Intellectual Property laws must change. Piracy in all its forms (downloading, remixing, expanding upon a story) is the *only* means to an end that the *audience* can use to participate in traditions that are thousands of years old: The retelling and relating of a narrative, song, or art to new audiences and new media.
**TL;DR**  *Consumers* shit. *Audiences* create.

Am I missing the value proposition here?
@_date: 2019-03-17 19:29:47
I'd establish some cash flow with 25% to 35% in bonds, if the bonds mature (which they should), you get all of your initial capital back. Take the cash flow and either pay bills or invest in other assets.
Hodl the rest.
@_date: 2018-06-06 05:17:47
Technically it's 23% of the way to 30K.
@_date: 2018-06-17 06:44:25
 ITM?
@_date: 2018-11-12 09:04:28
Don't waste it on dumbshit.
Keep 25 BTC, sell the rest as you need to.
1. Pay off all outstanding debts (maybe not a mortgage, but certainly pay off a good chunk of principle). 
2. Find a good money manager put 100k into bonds and/or dividend stocks. With 80% of that money target "safe" investments, with 20% of that money target "risky" investments (high yeild bonds).
3. Have about 50K worth of fun, getting experiences or starting new hobbies.
4. Keep some capital on hand as an emergency fund (6 months of salary).

Well at a minimum, btc can put western union out of business, at a maximum BTC will be the world currency.
Both the minimum and the maximum are unlikely.

That's just silly.

I imagine a nuclear program would cost in the billions to fund.

 Bitcoins have useful transaction properties.
@_date: 2018-02-01 03:20:32
Isn't that what Bcash was for? Lowering the cost of buying more BTC to 0?
1. Hold BTC
2. Generate BCH
3. Sell BCH to buy BTC.
@_date: 2018-03-04 08:48:20
How are they exchanging into Fiat without a bank? lol.
Head line should be "NorKs use banks to transfer money, funding nuclear program, despite sanctions"
