Thanks for this.
I hate the tendency of financial journalists (even the economist) to report notional values to sell print.

I'm actually interested in your writeup of the history of why those shares exist.
[edit: I found your writeup below. Thanks for it]

Well, except that Mt. Gox and the other exchanges are operating as conduits between a national currency and Bitcoin. If anything they're inextricably tied to a national economy because Bitcoin doesn't need them to exchange Bitcoin between individual Bitcoin denominated accounts.

No serious individual is suggestion that if the FDIC fund was insufficient, then losses would be incurred by depositors who met their criteria. There would be a bailout so fast your head would spin.

Perhaps we need some sort of Bitcoin depository insurance, paid for by all the Bitcoin exchanges.

How did she pay for her bus with bitcoin?

In case you want your 1$ back, you can mail those pieces into the bureau of engraving and printing. They'll mail you a check.

Then sell them?

If you have to ask, you shouldn't be making one.

Yeah, but MMM has to publish a public key when it wants to receive bitcoin.

Quick rise? PayPal is 17 years old. If it were a person it would be old enough to drive.

It's trivial to have a larger growth on a smaller base. Visa is O(Trillions ) of payments/year.

Gold is used in jewelry because it's pretty.

I look forward to reading your writeup of the discussion.

Tried. I even opened an account, but haven't figured out how to get an address out of them yet.
I figured that if I could trace the volume of transactions, I could answer whether the recent price movement is related to MMM or not. 
@_date: 2015-03-24 16:37:46
Those are unrelated.

Isn't that sort of the way the blockchain works? All transactions are committed to the public ledger?
@_date: 2015-10-09 20:23:34
Why wouldn't you?
@_date: 2015-10-26 16:47:06
Except that it has massive fraud risk since transactions aren't reversible. You're just swapping one type of counterparty risk for another, broader class of counterparty risk.

Under what metric is paypal bigger than Visa?
@_date: 2015-11-17 03:49:09
So you're in colombia? 
@_date: 2015-10-27 01:01:35
I didn't even touch on the difficulty of securing your funds. Even if you pretend that securing your bitcoins is trivial and universal, you still have the risk that any time you transact with another party, that they will not deliver their side of that transaction.
@_date: 2015-11-17 04:13:42
sure sure, just that unless you're in colombia, you're not paying 5$/month, but more like 8~10
@_date: 2015-11-17 03:29:58
If MMM really is the driver of the recent price movement, there ought to be way more than 2 people who would be willing to divulge the public key of MMM. 
Sadly, my limited sleuthing has not turned anything up. I'm trying to get some quantitative measure to answer whether they were correlated.  
@_date: 2015-10-27 00:54:15
You're misusing the term business cycle.
