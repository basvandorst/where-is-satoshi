That's good advice, thank you.

Yeah, it's not as scam, just a very bad investment.

It would look better if BTC was about $2000 higher!

Or people just don't want another market-destabilizing hard fork again for no good reason. Achieving mainstream acceptance is going to be difficult if the chain keeps splintering every few months/years. It won't be taken seriously.

I get that for ICOs but there seem to be tons out there that just look like clones.  Like, why would we need Digibyte (random example) in a Bitcoin world?

But all those things you mention are really just different denominations or delivery method of one currency.  Doesn't seem analagous.

It's me, your... cousin. Send Bitcoin? Just that ugly 1.64 will do, leaving you with a nice round number.

Worst case you can live under a Bitcoin.

What do you mean when you say they are "playing fields?" Thanks.

I think that block shows BIP91 support, but doesn't actually change the version field for activation.  476601 shows 0x20000002 (BIP141 deployment) and 476718 shows 0x20000012 (BIP91 deployment).
I could be wrong.  Either way, all good.

F2Pool just signaled.

Those are fairly good odds.
