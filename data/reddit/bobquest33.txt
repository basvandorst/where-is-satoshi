Well thank you for me its also not a religion but always an opportunity to spice up life after all its not just a payment system. I feel its always worth promoting Bitcoin or following it.

Thanks man, its for making big change. Also promote Satoshi's vision big time. And also support improvements in the new technology.

Bitcoin has also changed me, I have become more confident and also I feel like a new person. In promoting Bitcoin I do not feel any doubts, shackles or doubts. I feel free.

 - i feel this is a hack and this time a massive one or a complete exit scam. Worst effect on the BTC investors.

I feel a hard fork is the fork of the chain exposing the users of replay attack and many exchanges and miners and dev are rightly angry coz not enough time nor thought given to the fork.In fact facts are coming out as we go. One big issue i see is the 8mb block size if am right that will take many small time recreational miners out of the game and also will give too much power to ant miners. Next big issue is the centralization of Blockchain. As you would need powerful nodes and much faster network to really prevent the man in the middle attack Another big issue is the official bcc wallet is the bitcoinabc wallet which is a full node … No one rally knows how exchanges and wallets are ready for the hard fork. Very irresponsible on behalf of viabtc and a small section of the miners to expose so many users of btc to a kind of hard fork that many are not ready or understand to a limited extent
Altcoins run on a different port and they change consensus mechanism and though they start with the code.But this fork is both code and chain so very risky. And what bcc is selling is that you use both btc and bcc so the risk of these users heightened. I think many are doing so they selling Altcoins and hoarding tagin my thought to dump bcc after Aug 1
