In the short term, government incompetence will prevent them issuing their own blockchain technology

You can marry without involving the state (or the blockchain). 
You and your spouse can do this by sworn affidavit. Make your vows to each other 'before your creator', and ask those in attendance to act as witness by signing reverse side of paperwork. You and spouse sign the LAWFUL marriage affidavit at relevant office and get it stamped.
Anyone wishing to challenge the affidavit would have to do so in a court showing they have first hand personal knowledge.
You do not need to involve the state in any divorce. Those who need a certificate of marriage can then print their own lawful certificate by themselves. 
the use of spouse is useful for same sex marriage.

creator would assist those of different religions ... in sight of Jehovah or In sight of Ra could mean fighting over the words of ceremony. the method works, i have assisted people not LEGALLY married obtain visas. A lawful marriage is superior to a legal one and no licence required

Ok, i will focus my attention there ( looks like information overload at first glance ). I have never filled in an IRS 1040 form. Normally tell them i am not qualified and will only file if exempted from any liability. 30yrs success with this approach

When we get sick normally we depend on our friends and family for assistance to get better or pay bills.. (most people do, especially those with no insurance etc)
Maybe Chris could ask his family! Well one of the reasons that i like the bitcoin/crytpo space is because of the people in it. Is it just me or does nobody else think of the space like its where our friends and crypto family are?
When a 12 year kid (just turned 13 last friday) can be moved to start a crowd fund for someone he barely knows but respects / admires because of his work in the space then i think it is time for many in the space to help out.
I dont have an income but $10 was sent to the fund and i will send more if i have the BTC. Young Ollie wont have money but he made the effort to help as much as he could.
Monks and kids are not going to be able to make large contributions but VC's and business could .. and could do it easily. I have confidence in the  and those in the crypto community. 
Lets try to hit the fund target and hopefully get Chris to see the specialist(s) he needs.

Thanks for getting behind the appeal for  health care. The above post concerning the  project contains wrong information. 
The full nodes built by Chris are sold at cost. Chris has chosen to work for what a Chinese worker would earn in order to highlight the very low earnings of those workers and at the same time letting the public know the real costs of the parts.
The full nodes can be purchased by and shipped to anyone anywhere.. though I know Chris is keen to have them distributed in countries where nodes either don't exist or are very few and far between.
