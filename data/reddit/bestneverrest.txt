OP is talking about banking systems screwing people - these systems will not change. Loaning money is an example of where a bank is needed, the BANK is needed and currently there is no platform for it. 
Yes, bitcoin can be loaded just like anything else - but from where? Where can you get a bitcoin loan? nowhere.
So OPs point of people not trusting bitcoin because they don't understand banks is stupid to say the least as it shows how little OP has actually used the banks services.

That's the biggest problem with this sub, its just an echo chamber. 
I believe that BTC will fail and blockchain tech will succeed. That doesn't mean you can't make money in the meantime but I don't believe BTC will be the world changing currency that some people think it will be

Yeah you are right, but it's something bitcoin cannot do unless handled by a third party like a bank. OP is talking about people not understanding how banks work when OP doesn't know how banks work. I think OP just thinks they sit on your money and that's it.

I agree, you are absolutely disconnected from reality. You think showing up in TV shows and kids cartoons means something? Their audience is kids.

Exactly. The centralized database is what I believe will prevail. 
EDIT: I see this being used by governments as forms of ID etc.
