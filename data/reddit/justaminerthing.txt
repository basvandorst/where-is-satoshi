This guide has the full list of parts and steps:
 I repurposed an old raspberry pi 3 project so that made it a bit cheaper. Total cost would be about $130 for all of the parts.
I haven't started to install it or download the blockchain yet so I cant give you a rough estimate of time. I also have very little linux knowledge except for when I made a retropie so it may he a bit harder but the guide seems pretty straightforward.

You're having to trust a 3rd party to hold onto your funds. This is essentially like having a crypto bank. You technically don't own the bitcoin/crypto since it's in a wallet that you're unaware of the private key/seed words for.

I've had my WF account linked to my Coinbase account for about 2 years now and no issues. I think that it was a conversation someone had with a clueless customer service agent and then it spread like wildfire.
I've bought BTC with cash app, Gemini, and coinbase with no issues.

Never type your seed on a device that's connected to the internet.
Old school is the new school.

I moved my BTC from Gemini to my Ledger's segwit address. Doesn't that mean they have implemented it?

Thank you so much! This explains it in a way that helps make things "click"! I'll dig in.

If we're guessing who is Satoshi, I've always leaned more towards it being Hal Finney than Nick.

Thank you a lot! I really appreciate it. I thought I had replied sooner. I'll be sure to use this to pass along on the LN!

Is this real life or a movie plot? Which timeline are we in?

I don't think you've done enough research regarding hardware wallets.
Your crypto isn't stored on the actual device, your seed words are. If that hardware wallet dies then as long as you have your 24-word seed it can be swept into a different wallet.

Congrats man! I'm extremely jealous of your situation. I'd like to pay off my debts and then be comfortable like you but I think I'm a little late to that boat but hey, who knows. If only I caught on earlier this year or years ago when I ignored it originally.
It's better to get involved now than to kick myself again a few months or years from now, right?

wait, you guys aren't mining Stanley Nickels?

Holy shit man. That would more than pay off my fucking student loan debt. I'll gladly HODL my one though and hope for the best.

Wire transfer if you want same day funds.

I lost some sleep because of it being a global market and a volatile time. She was interested but got tired of hearing me talk about it, mainly because it started to make me sort of hopeful for the future as a means to pay for an engagement ring, get married, etc.
What's funny is that I could've afforded a ring with my gains. She didn't want to hear me finally start to have a short term vs. long term plan in life. Sure, you can't predict the future but I was right with what I was saying.
I guess that was just too much to handle. It ended up being for the best though. I have a different outlook on life now and won't dwell on the past that I can't change. I'm only looking towards the future!

Ya know, I don't think I've ever seen the word "noogie" written out.

Seriously, if you guys need someone to talk to or just to vent to, feel free to PM me. I love this community and I want to make sure you're all of a sound mind and that you have someone to talk to who's possibly going through a similar situation.

You should replace your BTC if you use it for something.

One lesson I learned is to not have "FOMO" (fear of missing out). Watch the price trends and also spread out how much you want to spend over a certain amount of time.
Keep in mind it's a volatile market but it's definitely fresh and will only go up from here so I'm looking forward to 2018. You only lose money if you sell! But that's also how you make money so....

Wire. Transfer. Eat the fees if you want funds same-day.

Reddit is way more mainstream than you think.

This would be amazing. We'll see!

As someone whose 5 1/2 year relationship recently ended because of discovering bitcoin during the $3-4k dip in September.........I love this.
Can you modify it to "IF YOU CAN'T HANDLE ME DURING FUD" as well?

What about having to listen to the song ["Living in a Box" by the band "Living in a Box" off of the hit album....yep, you guessed it, "Living in a Box"]( on repeat 24/7?

You actually need 100,000,000 satoshis for 1 BTC.
1 satoshi = .00000001 BTC
