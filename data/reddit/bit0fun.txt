This seems so shady especially since there is an MLM hidden within this service. Also it can't possibly be sustainable given the finite number of Bitcoin, so I'm going to call BS on this being legit

You're welcome, and no worries! Hope all goes well for you

Biggest thing is don't invest more than you're willing to loose. Given its your life savings, I don't know if that's the best idea. At most, do half because then you at least have money you can use if need be for emergencies. It's a bit easier to be able to pay bills etc with fiat than btc right now. 
Think of it this way, imagine bitcoin crashes tomorrow and goes back to 3 cents. Your 8,000 you saved is now worth nothing. Are you really financially stable enough for the foreseeable future with that kind of loss?
I'm not trying to scare you, just provide reason to the madness. I understand that the allure of huge returns are nice, but it's not worth the insane risk if you have nothing else in the end.

It always happens. You try to buy low and sell high, but end up buying high and selling low. Or the fees get you. 
I don't know your financial situation, but I would suggest putting aside some money to buy bitcoin every so often. Buying a huge amount at once could potentially do well, but then you can't buy more if there is a dip. Say put in 50 a week. You'll end up getting the dips, maybe buying a bit higher here and there, but you'll make up for it. 
It's a safer way to get on the boat without splitting it in two.
All in all, be smart about what you do and you'll come out on top.

Not to try and one up you, but I had a dream a week or two ago that it dropped to 0. That was a little terrifying as I was watching the ticker.

The mining difficulty is way to high that you won't be able to mine Bitcoin without specialized hardware. The days of mining with your personal computer are long gone.

If you're scared of a drop, don't invest more. Invest what you're willing to lose. If you want a safer investment tool, you should be using bonds or just have a interest bank account. 
It's always risk vs reward. Higher risk is usually higher rewards.

Nah man, gotta loosen up /s
@_date: 2019-10-30 18:10:07
At least $1. Probably a bit more than that though

If you're spending 1 btc on groceries with today's price, either you are a catering service or need to cool it on the food
Fun stuff regardless

It's a shame. Being in NY I feel the pain of jumping through hoops for this stuff. Hope all goes well in the future for friends in Hawaii

Well it's always a possibility that you will lose everything. As much as people can try to predict what bitcoin will do, it isn't guaranteed. That's how it goes. 
You may very well make a ton from it as an investment piece, or lose it all. That's why you only put in as much as you're willing to lose. Yeah you might not make as much from it, but you're playing it safer. 
It's similar to the stock market in terms of safety, as in it is not guaranteed. But Bitcoin can be supseptible to manipulation and is very volatile compared to stocks, which can cause more loss, or massive gains. 
Be careful, and good luck in your endeavors.

When access to quantum computers become a little easier, of course. It means the end to most forms of encryption as we know it. There are quantum encryption methods being developed, but that's not going to be something an individual would be concerned with. 
However, if the hashing function no longer becomes difficult to reverse (SHA256 in Bitcoin's case), this could mean the entire trust system breaks and counterfeit transactions could be injected, or the wallets themselves would be easy to break into. 
For the latter option, I would be lead to believe that this would be mitigated for the most part by institutions using newer forms of encryption for wallets and cold storage etc, but for the proof of work part it may lead to the demise of crypto currencies as they exist today. 
I will put a disclaimer that I am not all knowing and I have only a small understanding of all these fields and to no freak out since this will be in a further future. Think of it like the 1960s for classical computers; we aren't in the 90s where everyone had easy access to computers. I can't state timeframe because it's impossible to tell
