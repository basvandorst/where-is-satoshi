Buy a gold band and have the private key engraved on the inside. Just make sure you have that backed up though.
Perhaps have half of the private key engraved and have another gold band made for you with the other half by a different jewelery maker.

Use a monero browser miner at coinpot instead. That will get you more then a satoshi in a day.

Oh crap. I have that same amount on my coinpot account from browser mining. Time to cash out lol

Why wait for only $100? $100 is an okay amount to lose. A day of work? 1/3 of an xBox? 4 movie tickets? It is all relative.
Best to get some now so that if it does go down your Average Cost will be good. It has always gone back up over my buy in price.
@_date: 2017-08-11 21:48:53
they will only see the coins that were sent to that address. But if you have an HD wallet that changes the address every time you were sent some, they will not know the total amount you have or even if those address are linked. 
Unless of course you send all of your coins to another address, then it combines them all to the new address. But you can just claim you spent it all. lol

Well. I guess I could tell the truth. Running faucets and ads for Bitcoin rewards. And mining altcoins that I exchanged on shapeshift.
@_date: 2017-08-12 20:08:06
I believe it has to do with infrastructure. Billions have been spent on research, development, purchase, land, electricity, ext for bitcoin to flourish. Investors of equipment and companies have a lot of lose or gain with bitcoin. Making it known and accepted lets the value go up so they may recoup their expenditures and get more coins in the wild.
Unlike myspace or facebook, bitcoin has real assets in play with many many different companies and individuals instead of just one company. If another coin was to be a real competitor, it would have to justify the application specific hardware change and the costs associated with it.
@_date: 2017-08-29 08:25:07
I do agree with you. Bitcoin is still king, but if another fork is going to distribute the miners even more, I can foresee some problems with the hashrate as bitcoin will be in its own multipool of Bitcoin competitors.
But, then again, the mempool is emptying out. As of this comment, the 30 mb of 1 sat fees transactions is next on the list. So maybe miners are figuring it out already. I could just be panicking for no reason. Lol.
@_date: 2017-08-12 16:14:03
Buy $100 right now
@_date: 2017-08-11 21:53:37
edit the settings to lower the transaction fee. I set mine to 0.0001 and it works fine. A 30 cent transaction fee is a-ok with me. Same that paypal charges for a $1. That is still $300 in fees if a miner put found a block with 1000 transactions. $600 when segwit goes down. Sounds sustainable.
Edit: Changed price to 0.0001 from 0.00001 (Had to many zeros from my calc)

@_date: 2017-08-14 14:28:24
It will be okay. It will be confirmed if you have enough sats in there. The mempool is just so large right now. Some say it's spam, but it could also be people moving Bitcoin in anticipation for segwit activating soon.
Segwit was locked in and not turned on yet.
@_date: 2017-08-13 08:52:04
4 cents is pretty low. I think a 30 cents transaction is fine. Right now that is about 8000 sats. If a block has 2000 transactions on it, that will be over $600 in fees. So not a lot. But if say there was 10000 transactions a block and bitcoin was $15000. That would be $3000 in fees at 2000 sats a transaction. What if there were 20000 a block? $6000 fees for a 6.25 BTC reward ($93000) it all is crazy to think about in the future. Sooooo much money
@_date: 2017-08-17 02:56:32
You can collect on faucets. I am collecting 2 mBTC a week from faucets. In one transaction. After a month, I send it to another wallet to reduce the transaction size further.
@_date: 2017-08-12 16:53:23
screw that. in the next 15 minutes!
@_date: 2017-08-12 16:21:31
Sorry, my bad, had the price wrong. 0.0001 BTC. Currently, there are nearly 2000 transaction a block. So it is already $800 for a block plus the normal 12.5 BTC. So when segwit is turned on, there will be about 3500 transactions in a block to be $1400. That's of course if everybody used the same price. There will be those who will use way more to make a transaction to get theirs confirms in the next block. Just saying, that a sub $1 fee transaction is doable.
Assumption 8/12/2017: Market price of bitcoin just under $3900
@_date: 2017-08-07 14:00:50
Going to be less. That guy lost over a 1000 bitcoins to the trash on his hard drive. How many more has this happen to people? How many coins have been lost to time. How many more will lost in the future.

I made a donation at coinpayments to vote for Digibyte in Bitcoin. That would be a cool coin to use for web payments.
@_date: 2017-08-28 08:22:54
I keep thinking to myself. Maybe Bitcoin should implement Digishield and get a new difficulty every block so miners quit jumping around and leaving the chain with low hash and high difficulty.
@_date: 2017-08-23 04:33:44
Mining bitcoin now a days requires a big upfront cost and investment of equipment, space, and electricity to be profitable. But the big miners are already established and make it happen. You could probably mine some alts using CPU and GPU power and exchange it for bitcoins using shapeshift or changelly. Some alt pools out there will do the exchange for you too. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 08:40:17
Nice! Me too. And I got it all from faucets lol

Checkout Coinpayments.net. they have a Shopify plugin
@_date: 2017-08-23 04:05:19
Maybe profiteering is not the correct word. But if miners keep jumping around to two or maybe three different chains, it will create a backlog for a chain with a high difficulty. Miners will choose to move to a lower difficulty chain leaving the users to deal with long transaction times because of an abnormally high difficulty. And then, after a week or two, they come back when it is lower again and the cycle repeats itself once again.
In the recent past, bitcoin did not have this problem. But it was there in other crypto coins that used scrypt. Bitcoin will now face this unless something gets into the works now.
@_date: 2019-06-28 02:18:53
I could say I am at 100% profit as all the Bitcoin I acquired has been from faucets, coindice games, airdrops, rewards for completing tasks and games, and mining monero on two home computers. But I did buy $2 of Bitcoin from a coinstar to see it work. So far I have gathered 0.01 BTC equivalent in coins.
@_date: 2019-06-24 03:57:14
I bought some Bitcoin as a test from a coinstar that uses coinme
It was early May and I put $2 in the machine. They only accept cash for bitcoin purchases. So if you have coins, out those in, take your ticket to the teller and get cash. My guess is that coinme is only licensing the booths from coinstar.
Anyway! Coinme inflates the buy price a little. It spits out the ticket to get on the website and transfer. There was no fee to transfer but there was a purchase fee. It looks like they took about 25 cents of my 2 dollars. I was able to get 0.00028984 from the $2 at a coinstar. Next time I am going to put $20.
So now I checked the profit on that BTC and I am up $1.30
I win.

The only thing I can think of for hacking a early private key that those that are non encrypted with a password. If computers get fast enough to processes those guesses, it leads to believe that the early Satoshi coins could be up for grabs. Obviously, it will take even more processing power to find the keys that do have passwords, and even longer when an update happens that take into account the possible future of quantum computers, and even even longer when word gets out that coins have moved from a "lost" address and an update goes out to make it even harder. When this comes around, the gold mining would then be to try and find lost keys instead of adding to the blockchain. 
And to prevent coins from being found, all you would have to do is move them to a new address that have the higher security standards. Man, the future is weird.

You might still be able to recover them. It sounds like you opened a new BSV wallet instead of using the fork derivative path. Check this site to see if you can recover:

1. You know those inspirational word posters? Have a series of them with a hidden word of your seed.
2. A RFID chip inserted into you that contains an encrypted string of your seed
3. A woven blanket that depicts the repeated binary version of the seed. Pass down to each new generation.
4. A crystal family airloom that when a laser is shined through will project words on the wall
5. Empty a bullet casing , write on paper your seed and put it inside, replace bullet and place in with replaced gun safe with other bullets.
6. Notches on a bed post in binary. ��
7. A stamp collection where the edges of the stamps are torn to represent the binary equivalent of the seed.
8. Post hidden numbers on some blog websites that are guaranteed to be archived on the wayback machine. Individually they will be odd, but over time, and put together, your seed.
9. Bury large rocks, trees, walkways in your yard that can represent a QR code.
10. Bathroom tiles that look to be random, but are a binary representation of your seed.
Whew. Ideas are hard!

You should always encrypt your device. And save that secret key off device.

You know. Digibyte is able to handle those transaction speeds and volume today.
@_date: 2017-07-18 15:57:19
There are only two ways to look at the wallet. If your have the private keys. In which case the coins can be spent. And if you have the extended public key. In which case new addresses to receive can be made. It is never a good idea to use any of these in a web service.
@_date: 2017-07-05 01:04:57
Yeah. The only thing that Digibyte does not have tight now is adoption. More developers will have to make easy to plug in APIs to allow that. But a good trade off is Litecoin. Shorter confirm time, lower fees, already with Segwit, and with 11k nodes. If Digibyte gets the level of adoption that Litecoin gets, it already has 60k nodes. But they both are dependent on Bitcoin tech and price. As Bitcoin goes up, all other go up.
@_date: 2017-07-04 00:23:15
First. Be skeptical. Because if your bank sees a deposit for a very large sum over $10000, that have to report it. They will use your good name to make deposit for you to purchase coin. Coinbase uses your personal info and is registered as a money changer in every state. They too will have to report capital gains. Add all this up and you could be looking at a huge IRS tax bill.

I am a bit confused by your message? Please tell me what you think.
@_date: 2017-07-04 00:34:48
You can use local bitcoins to purchase sorta anonymously. The coins are much higher prices though. Maybe start small to test the sellers? You can use paper wallets to store the coins offline or you can use an app like coinomi to view the coins. The coins are actually not in your possession. They are a line item on the blockchain. The only way they can be sent to another address is if you possess the private keys. So as long as you backup your keys. You are safe.
@_date: 2017-06-22 04:23:35
I use Coinomi on Android. I like they have an integrated shapeshift feature to exchange coins on the fly. The wallet private keys are encrypted as well. The best feature I like is a running total of your cash. Check em out!
@_date: 2017-06-22 04:40:36
They should have one for Android soon. But I heard jaxx should be okay in iOS since iOS is sandbox encrypted.
