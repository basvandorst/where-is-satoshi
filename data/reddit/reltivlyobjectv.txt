* Bitcoin is artifically pumped from the hype of being first to market. The prices of altcoins like Litecoin are arguably more justified. Investing in other coins like XMR or LTC is wiser, because it isn't currently pumped by hype, but they still rise when bitcoin does, just not by extraordinary margins. A bitcoin crash would likely spell the death for bitcoin, but that would be from the speculators pulling out; other coins don't derive such a large percentage of their worth from speculators, so such a crash wouldn't make them worthless.
* Not all other cryptos are the same technology. Monero is often referred to as an altcoin, but it is hardly such. Diversifying your assets is considered good investment practice.

Now that you’ve told us, you have to pretend that you lost them all.
I’ll be gracious enough to hold them for you. Definitely won’t have any missing. Swearsies.

Took me a second to notice the switch from Mitch Hedberg to Salvador Dali.

You don't have to take a stance on the administration. Oppose when you feel it's right. Support it when you feel it's right.

My gut says you need bigger transaction fees.

The little black and white image is the code. It's a visual representation of your private key. If you can find the picture, you have your coins.
Do you remember what google app?

You can just hit the "create new" option. You'll be importing your coins manually.
Bread wallet should have the option to import a private key (it might be buried in settings). From there, it will open your camera. Then take a picture of your code.

Download Bread Wallet on your phone and see if it's a valid private key

While you are right that you are *owed* the coins under the law, a company that goes bankrupt because of a hack cannot pay you the Bitcoin you are owed.

I'd bet you money basically all of them are; there might be one or two places out there, but I'm assuming that most are just set up to catch nefarious types.

For those lurking who may not get it: Bitcoin has an enforced scarcity, which creates value (we see a similar phenomenon with gold). The Federal Reserve prints money to pay US debts, which reduces the scarcity and overall value of the dollar. Because USD can be produced on a whim, it is closer to Monopoly money than BTC.

I'm torn, because this sounds r/conspiracy at first, but it actually would make sense.

- The higher the price, the harder it is to have X percent increase, but the easier it is to have X percent decrease.
- Transaction fees are based off of a certain fraction of a coin. This means that the more the coin is worth, the more expensive to use it (I recently spent $2 just to send $20 in BTC to myself)
- Bitcoin price is more driven by hype and being first to market. Crypto has very good and valuable aspects, but Bitcoin is not the best algorithm, just the first. Monero and Etherium are better for privacy, and Litecoin has always been worth less than BTC, even though it activated SegWit long before.
Bitcoin price hikes are almost solely based off of speculation (as are most securities and coins), but I would argue *too much* of BTCs price is based on speculation.
