Wish I had of seen it happening or had an indication about it.  I would have sold everything and rebought at the bottom of the dip.
@_date: 2018-01-08 03:08:24
[Check out this dip that happened this morning \(Jan 7\) at just before 5am EST.](
It was on QuadrigaCX, Canada's main exchange.  255BTC moving in 10 minutes is INSANE on a Canadian exchange.  Average volume is around 700-900 compared to Gdax's usual 15000 or so.  Look like there was a seller so aggressive that they just sold off everything they could and filled every buy order from $20600CAD down to $15000CAD.  It'd be like someone selling off 4800BTC in an instant on Gdax.

This isn't about Bitcoin...this is about large sums of money being used for a house purchase period...
You have to account for large sums of money under the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act.
You have to fully account for Bitcoin profits, RRSP withdrawals and even the cash in your mattress among other things.  It's been this way since 2002 under the current iteration of the practice.  Anything over $3000CAD is considered a large deposit.
It's easy to prove where you got the money.  All you have to do is show proof that the money you bought bitcoin with is legit (pay stubs, Notice of Assesments, etc), confirmation of your deposit(s) into exchanges, a history of any trades you've made and withdrawal confirmation/receipts.  You'll probably also be required to show proof that you declared capital gains on your taxes for previous years, if any.  (side note: make damn sure the government knows about your bitcoin profit and you pay taxes accordingly...at that sum, you'll lose your house and/or go to jail for tax fraud if you don't declare capital gains on it).
You have kept track of all this, right?  You didn't dump that much into crypto without keeping a good history, right?
Sounds like you're just angry because you didn't do your homework.
@_date: 2018-01-04 01:18:05
Easy...take the amount of fiat you've deposited into exchange accounts and divide by the amount of bitcoin you own.  That number is your break even point.  If the market price is below it, you've lost money.  If the market price is above it, you've made money.

Oh shit...you're serious, aren't you?
We close on our first home tomorrow (jan 12) afternoon.  It's a normal, single family home that still cost us a small fortune...more, actually considering fees and other costs.  I'm actually a little bitter about the price we paid in relation to comparable homes and what the sellers bought it for only 10 years ago. It's still a dirt cheap deal compared to the houses in ridiculously and artificially overpriced markets like San Francisco, Vancouver, etc.
This home would go for a LOT more in other markets.  Malibu is actually not *that* expensive for what you get because it's saturated with 7-8-9 figure mansions.

And to think, if the influential powers in the crypto market in general had of actually worked towards a tangible solution to fees/scaling/whatever, the price would be a hell of a lot higher, fees lower and transactions faster.
Except they all need to throw hissy fits and build another highway instead of improving the existing road when traffic got inevitably too much.
I'm in the process of cashing out right now primarily because I've got a little one due in March and we close on a house in 3 1/2 weeks...also because I've maxed out my replace-by-fee and the transactions still haven't fucking gone through.

Coinbase is the perfect platform for a pie-eyed noobie with a fist full of cash looking to venture in to Bitcoin.  Without the ease of access and shallower learning curve, I'd be willing to bet Bitcoin wouldn't have hit the number of users and all time highs that we enjoy today.

If you think about it, the Bitcoin community treats BTC more like stocks, bonds, funds, etc. and goes against Wall Street because users treat it more like an investment than a currency (which is my angle...I'm paying for my son's college fund via smart Bitcoin investing now and he isn't due to be born until March). The BCash community is targeting banks by trying to make BCash into a quick and cost effective transfer system.  It's 2 sides of the same coin, pardon the pun.  It's too bad the Vertards can't stop throwing a hissy fit and allow the 2 communities to work together towards the whole point of cryptocurrency.  The mods can be free to cast the first stone if they feel they are without sin in this matter as well.

Theoretically speaking, if Bitcoin took over completely as a single global unit of currency and assuming there will be a 21 million coin cap, one coin could be worth a little over $57 million each at current estimates.
The most logical estimate I can find as to how much wealth is currently spread out over the world is about $1.2 quadrillion.  Kind of a half assed calculation and it'd probably never hit that much per coin considering governments will get their greedy hands into it eventually.

Coinbase is good for giving newbies easy, secure access to their first bitcoin.  It lets people get their foot in the cryptocurrency door and hopefully they'll educate themselves further after that and buy more from an exchange so they can haggle a little/reduce fees and then get their coins onto more secure wallets.

They know EXACTLY what they're doing.  They've carved out their niche in the bitcoin exchange market and have done a remarkable job in following through with and succeeding in their intentions.  They're raking in a fortune for share holders.  You can't argue with that, really, from a business perspective.  
That being said, it's going to bite them in the ass hard if they don't make their platform more consumer friendly.  Their business model is HIGHLY reliant on high volumes of uneducated and inexperienced crypto investors.  As bitcoin becomes more mainstream, knowledge of and about crypto will rise.  The high fees and low limits will put them out of business...and probably sooner than anyone thinks.

You'd need to very carefully weigh the potential profit vs the cost of an adequate solar array and/or wind turbine.  You would definitely need a battery bank big enough to keep the mining rig going for at least a week in case of weather or you'd need a solar/wind hybrid system.  When the sun isn't shining, the wind is probably blowing.  Either way, you're going to have to spend a lot of money to keep the power up and running.  
You'd also have to consider permits and local law regarding generating your own electricity.  You can bet your 10 acres on the fact that big power generating companies have spent money on keeping micro-generation stations to a minimum so they can be as profitable as possible, meaning there will be a lot of red tape to cut through for you.
Spoiler: The amount you'd have to spend on generating power vs mining bitcoin while still being a worthwhile venture would probably make you shit your pants.

It may be worth the convenience to let them take a few days to get their money together for you.  It'd be a hell of a lot easier than kicking them out without you having money in hand and having to go to small claims court to have the ability to take it by force (garnishment, etc).
You could always give them a ride to a bitcoin ATM and have them use their credit card to deposit into your BTC wallet.  Take a video of it happening to prove to the credit card company it was a legitimate transaction and hold onto any documents proving she owes you.
@_date: 2017-09-08 02:55:38
Nice try.  If they haven't paid rent, you need to file for eviction and get an OK from a judge.  You can't just kick them out.  The system screws landlords big time, but that's your only legal option.
Also the credit card company will get in contact with you regarding the charge back.  They won't just reverse a charge simply because the tenant asked for it.  They'll verify the legitimacy of the transaction.  As soon as you get any credit card payment, call the card company with the transaction information and tell them your tenant may attempt a false charge back.
