We got 2 people now. 1 more person and I will send bitcoins to both of you
@_date: 2018-10-12 15:27:57
Sent you 0.0001. Remember you can get an extra 0.0001 btc if someone replies their bitcoin adress to your post. Just write that you accept that person and I will give both of you 0.0001 btc. Do it to up to 5 people.

What should I do about that?
@_date: 2018-10-08 23:19:11
I don't have any coins but if you have what I have in mind I think you would think my idea is a good one. 
@_date: 2018-10-10 21:25:24
Yes :)
@_date: 2018-10-08 23:28:02
I will try that if I don't get the respons I want from here. But I will def. try this idea out. Thanks for the tips
@_date: 2018-10-08 23:26:29
I don't think you get me. I will give the coins back to someone else for free
Edit: It's an easy algoritm to see if we can affect any coins price.

1) Yes. 2) Everyone who watches a video and want to earn money. I will increase the block-size as soon as everything has started. 3) I will think about this one, thanks! 4) I think I have both. 'Watching-a-video" and the money with blocks. 
Thank you for your input.

Good question.
@_date: 2018-10-10 20:49:16
How is this a ponzi scheme? I just give dogecoin away for free
@_date: 2018-10-10 10:48:23
The reset button won't delete the balance, only start the game over :)
You will only start all over again. Thanks for the reply though
@_date: 2018-10-08 23:28:35
I just need a good amount of supply of a coin people have. I will give them back to someone else for free until I don't have anymore.
@_date: 2018-10-10 20:46:54
What do you mean?

I'm talking about a coin, any coin without value. Just give me 10 of them and I will give them back to someone else. It's an really fascinating idea I promise.

You watch an advertising clip and get an code at the end of it.
@_date: 2018-10-07 15:00:40
I get it
@_date: 2018-10-08 23:12:07
With my algoritm everyone will earn coins. I just need a big supply of 1 coin to give it back. I will give everything back. It's just an idea I have that I want to try out.
@_date: 2019-06-20 16:25:53
It is in the "nextblockhash".
You just but 123 in the beginning, middle OR in the ending to get the right hash/algoritm for the next block. Then you just let the computer hash the number 123 (the nonce). Try it out.
@_date: 2019-06-06 13:40:17
201, It's not 201.
@_date: 2019-06-06 13:31:34
Haha. Nopp.
@_date: 2019-06-20 15:08:55
Thank you
@_date: 2019-06-06 13:46:31
It's not 11
@_date: 2019-06-20 16:15:20


Where do I just put a number (123 in the middle) to find the right nounce? Because I think 123 is the nounce for Bitcoin. You just put it in the beginning, middle or the end (123) and then win the next bitcoin block.

1. It's not 1.
