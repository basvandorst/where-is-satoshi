You people are delusional. Rita Ora is a circus monkey (as are all entertainers) and couldn't spell "marginal utility" if her life depended on it.
When the price of a buttcoin drops below the cost of mining per, it's game over.

Butters used to fiercely oppose regulation. What happened?

Yah, the use cases are immeasurable. It’s just that we haven’t figured it out yet, we’re waiting for morons like yourself to enlighten us.
Like I wouldn’t know what tools would make my life easier without someone telling me. Gtfoh, ya simple bastard.
Ten years on the market, less than 1% of people find use for it. From a scientific perspective that’s all you need to know about Buttcoin.

No, it's been dead for a long time. You just haven't realized it yet.

Still not understanding how supply and demand works in practice, huh? Can’t say I’m surprised. If creepto were a company it would be beyond dead by now.

I’ve read too much Hayek and Friedman to buy into this pyramid scheme at any price. You people lack basic econ knowledge.

Crypto is as useless as can be. You'd have to be an extremely talented imbecile to support a service that's been out for ten years without any significant demand for it. And call demand "mass adoption" while you're at it. No, it's called supply and demand, and while there's plenty of supply there's no demand. Imagine commercial internet being out for ten years and no one signing up to use it? Creeptards are beyond economically illiterate.
With that being said, bans are not the answer. People should be able to do whatever they want as long as they're hurting themselves.
