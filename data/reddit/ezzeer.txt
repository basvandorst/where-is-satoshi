The problem is that bitcoin core suddenly doesn't synch with the files on my computer.
So when I start it, it tell me that this is the first time i'm lauching it and I have to choose a folder to install it.
But the thing is that I already have it all!
bitcoin-qt.exe isn't recognizing my files and want to download it all again
I want to know if there is a way to come back to it without having to install it all again?

Hey, thanks for the answer but i'm not so familiar with bitcoin things^^
Could you explain in details how to do it?

Still 0 confirmation. Do you know where I can find estimated fees ?
I tried  but the fees shown are lower than thoses that I sent so I don't get it

What do you mean?
If I buy something on a website with bitcoin, I can pay the amount in an another currency? Which one?

Okay, it has worked.
Btc core is now lauching but I don't have my money and no transaction.
I still have my wallet.dat.
What should I do now?

Yeah that's what I though when I saw that. But how can I calculate the satoshi/byte before I send it?
And isn't there any way to instant transaction without 15$ fees?

Actually I still got money in BTC and have to spend it on different things.
Do I have to deal with thoses huge fees or is there a way to pay moderate fees and still get the transac trough?
Sometimes my transaction got higher fees than the amount i'm sending lol

So it just mean that I take blocks / chainstate / wallet and copy them in a backup folder in case I meet a new problem?
@_date: 2017-12-03 15:14:01
