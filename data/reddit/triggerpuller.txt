Whiny anarchist- Most bitcoiners seem to be smart rational folks but there is this vocal minority that seems to want to constantly create strife and angst as well as complain and toss FUD around.

Is Gemini licensed in Texas? That would be my big concern especially after bitifinex- And I think you may have answered your own question- I don't see Coinbase doing cheap marketing by raising the name of a competitor- just the fact that Coinbase is bigger, or you wouldn't be asking this question and gives me more options if something goes wrong. What can Gemini aside from fees what can Gemini do for me that CB can't?

Romanian hackers used to justify that American companies suffer the loss not customers so it was ok- Still felt good locking them up. Never understood the ridiculous mindset that the company or program suffers not the people. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 14:19:24
Maybe someone can help me understand why this means bitfinex complied? they aren't regulated in the US which is one reason many folks like them but to my knowledge nothing on paper in the US forces them to do anything. 
Is that true? I am probably under thinking this but to me it seems like, why would they bother doing it like this if the reality is they didn't have to since they aren't licensed. 
And if they really didn't have to do that why would they? Seems like an iffy way (obviously) to store customer funds.

yup the upside of bitcoin being a decentralized currency with pseudo anonymity is you can by dope off DNMs send money you friends and family without the gov't knowing. You can even buy stuff if a merchant accepts bitcoin without anyone knowing until of course the analog world gets involved and then most of the stuff goes away at some point. 
The downside is stuff like this happens and there is no or very little legal recourse You may be able to find some type of breach of contract or whatever but good luck getting that heard. I am NOT saying gov't should allowed but because in many situations they are impotent when it comes to btc the unintended consequence is there isn't a lot you can do about it.  Especially if you are using a company that is fixed in a location like China which doesn't have a great record of working with other agencies and is corrupt enough to keep folks with money out of handcuffs.

Or does it just push his issue to the front of the line in front of others who also are looking for help. I understand his frustration but I know of many posts where someone claims CB took their bitcoin but none where that was actually true. 
And to the OPs credit I'd hardly consider that a shitstorm.

Thanks for doing this- I love it when people prpvide help and knowledge to others relating to virtual currency/crypto

negative rumors? your comment doesn't even make it to the level of a rumor. Some twat making things up is not a rumor it is called a lie.
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:53:24
So every time some knucklehead makes a weird comment they should say something? That makes no sense. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:42:10
You are exactly what is wrong with the world of virtual currency. This is such a horse shit unverified and ridiculous comment. The friend of the friend comment doesn't even remotely come close to how pathetic the source is for this- What a dirtbag thing to do- these kinds of posts end up causing substantial problems for people.
If you knew anything about financial services you'd know that these companies when regulated such as coinbase is are jacked up with bonds, capitalization requirements etc. LONG before you'd heard from a friend of a friend regulators would be screaming their heads off if there was a threat. They'd be issuing warnings to the residents of their states etc. And since I am a customer in a regulated state and have not heard 1 peep I am going to assume you are FoS. 
Makes me wonder if you are shilling for another company-  
@_date: 2016-03-23 22:06:41

Man you are so right Feds have no idea what they are doing and others have said technically illiterate those guys can barely read and they are all just waiting to violate your rights. You youngins are way too smart.  Go ahead and do whatever you want to do Player. You got this. 
@_date: 2016-03-23 22:05:52
And there is of course a retarded idea that money means you are smart or better or is a measure. I know a lot of people with money that are pretty damned stupid, they are weak and cry at the first sign of trouble. Sort of like the guy that said feds only make 50k and are idiots. I know he will deny it but we watched him one night standing on the corner for 4 hours in the cold with his hands down his pants. Still have no idea WTF he was doing but I think we can al agree that if a man stands in the cold, mouth wide open hands down his own pants for 4 hours he ain't bright. 
We had some scientist (best in the nation) look at the video of him and they all shrugged and said well- our best guess is he that he really isn't very bright.

Not for nothin unless someone is sure it might not be helpful to the community to speculate- And OP not sure if you can ditch this post but I am relatively certain that seizure has a non disclosure clause. Maybe they goofed up and didn't put it in there but if so REALLY bad idea to publicize this. Trust me on that.

Yes, actually we do- If you are going to make a claim that could potentially harm a lot of people then yes we do expect you to provide proof and the whole I can't BS is just that BS and cowardice. If you have evidence that this is going to happen and you don't post it because you are simply worried about repercussions AFTER they prove you right then you are a coward. 
NDA's BTW don't matter if you have evidence of criminal wrongdoing or conspiracy. 
I know you THINK you are making sense but to normal rational people you are coming across as a bit daft.

I remember someone once told me. Never trust a company that is quick to publicly crap on a competitor- Plus, it is a pretty trashy thing to do. If your product is good, you don't need to negatively comment on a competitor or make insinuations- the public is smart enough to figure these things out without companies trashing their competition. It seems like almost any time a bitcoin company is discussed the lesser companies come out and jump on the bandwagon. And it is pretty pathetic to get on Reddit on a thread about a bitcoin company and pimp your own wares. 
Since you are here- How many active customers do you have? How are you different from e-gold or other services that claim to buy and store gold on the customer's behalf?  I asked because before they were arrested or shut down, many of those e-gold companies used to claim they had great auditing processes, secure and amazingly wonderful.. Do you guys still live in Germany? The gold is held in Switzerland. If like many new and improved bitcoin companies you guys go tits or experiencing a mysterious hack and lose everything- what are my options as a US citizen/resident. 
Sorry for all the questions there are ton of 'typos' on your website and it concerns me that a company with such transparency and accuracy standards is so hard to read. A reddit post is one thing, a website for a company that must be incredibly accurate shows lack of attention to detail. And since you mentioned Mt Gox when talking about Circle, a long term and trusted company- How do we know you won't 'Gox' your customers? When you have as much time as a trusted company as Circle, perhaps more of us who are smart, will take a look at your product. Until then, I personally would be uncomfortable using such a new company that seems to talk a lot about doing the right thing but can't even have someone properly edit their page or uses reddit to bag on a competitor.

Bank transfers aren't Coinbase's problem it is a timing issue and the ACH process. It takes that long for everyone to have an ACH clear not just Coinbase. There are some companies that use highly risky processes where they credit all accts once a ACH is initiated but they rarely last more than a few months due to fraudsters. I think CB takes wires. 
@_date: 2017-01-27 23:08:41
Me either- I plan properly, I don't hurry through transactions I take care of business and it works well for me.

Then a lawyer such as yourself would better serve the community by fighting the argument on behalf of yourself or someone else. I can say it would be appealed and destroyed within 5 seconds and it doesn't make it any more legit than what you said or realistic. I wish people would stop complaining on forums and actually DO SOMETHING- The US is turning in to a country full of people who complain a lot and do very little.  
@_date: 2016-12-02 18:56:39
No he actually didn't say that. Your argument is so weak you are making things up. pathetic. 
@_date: 2016-12-02 18:49:40
Why because the government makes the rules companies have to apply them where applicable. I mean it is cute that folks get mad at companies but it is the people you elect or the regulations you help implement as a resident of a state that are to blame- not the companies. 
@_date: 2016-12-02 19:03:55
So the IRS released its guidance, you know it released its guidance and knew at some point that gain/loss would need to be reported to them and yet you did nothing to track the bitcoin so you could have a full accounting of your financial activity. How does that make any sense? Not saying Coinbase is right or wrong but good luck saying I didn't track what I was liable to track
@_date: 2016-12-02 18:48:23
Can you sell cash? Why are you assuming cash and bitcoin are a 1:1 comparison or that banks who typically know a lot more about you than Coinbase would do things the same way. Not sure your comparison makes any sense. 
@_date: 2016-09-06 18:53:04
what sorts of freedom lobbies do you donate to? Not trying to be an ass but not sure why folks feel like it is the companies involved in bitcoin that need to fight this AND develop their respective platforms. gov't is more likely to listen to you than a company on matters like this- at some point btc users need to take more responsibility for this stuff than demanding companies stand up.  
@_date: 2016-09-06 19:00:48
One thing to keep in mind- dealing with exchanges that aren't following regs may result in downstream issues. Just something to be aware of. For example- If bitcoinbeaniebabies.com isn't follow the regs they may at some point get raided or hassled by cops or the states. And at some point they may have to turn over all records and for example- if they can't fight that over-reach you may find your info in the hands of the government anyhow. Just something to be aware of not saying it will happen. 
@_date: 2016-09-16 18:03:45
So if they can be fined or worse by FinCEN is that hiding or is it a company not going to jail so someone can do something illegal. At what point do we say- Well I wouldn't go to jail or lose a bunch of money so some customer can break the law or regulatory guidelines. Or do you feel that they should risk everything and suck it up for our benefit. I guess no wrong answer just kind of curious. It is clear they have to follow the law just wondering what you think their responsibility would be...
@_date: 2016-09-06 18:57:20
How much have you moved- most companies don't care until around 10K aggregate or single. And then you have issues like travel rule, KYC etc etc (suggest folks read up on regulations) most companies get this info to check a box and move forward. You are much more likely to draw unwanted attention by refusing to provide than providing. And getting angry with a company who is just following the law is the wrong route. 
Citizens need to work with state, local and federal representatives. THAT is who makes the rules not companies and they listen to you more than a small company like Circle, Coinbase etc. 
@_date: 2016-05-04 17:30:01
You are absolutely correct complaining about coinbase following the law is ridiculous- write your congressman, get active politically and stop electing the numpties that make these laws. 
I love to drive very fast however it is illegal at a certain point- I don't write BMW M sport and complain that the speed limit is wrong. Not a 1:1 analogy but the point stands- government makes the rules- we just have to obey them or face the consequences if we don't
@_date: 2016-05-04 17:21:35
Coinbase is not a bank- there is a definition of what a bank is, the regulatory requirements are clear and banks have oversight by an entirely different part of the government. Coinbase doesn't share any of that except that they are regulated and they have oversight- that doesn't mean they are a bank. 
Ok now that we realize you don't understand basic financial terms- Please provide us with an example of coinbase stealing someone's bitcoin. I am sure that I should probably define stealing for you but why bother. 
I hate to say it (not really) but after reading your post and how wrong slash clueless I am guessing the issue is you goofing something up. You call them a bank- they aren't, you accuse them of stealing someone's bitcoin/money yet there are no provable cases to my knowledge, no arrests no criminal charges. 
@_date: 2016-05-10 16:59:44
Because as PayPal found out many years ago if a Coinbase user is breaking the law and Coinbase could have avoided being part of that then they can get hammered for your gambling. 
Why should any company risk millions of dollars in fines and the other potential penalties for some who wants to gamble? Again- using bitcoin doesn't mean you can break the law or that bitcoin will keep you from being caught. 
@_date: 2016-05-04 17:27:16
usually is an aggregate over time.

you don't use Coinbase but you do feel compelled to enter a thread on coinbase and post- with all due respect in this thread your post is irrelevant.

Your bank generally has you walk in to the bank, provide ID etc etc. when a financial institution cannot do that and your move X amount of money the law is clear they have to do due diligence on you. 
It is part of life, part of doing business- using bitcoin doesn't change some realities of life- however you are free to use companies in the bitcoin space that aren't regulated, aren't following the rules, etc. which is cool until they come up with some BS about how they were hacked and now you btc is going but they are going to try real hard to get it back to you. 
@_date: 2016-05-10 16:57:11
Gambling online is illegal in the US are people really getting pissed off at a company who has to follow the law? Using bitcoin doesn't make you immune from prosecution if you break the law. It seems completely retarded to get pissed off at a company that is merely following the law.
