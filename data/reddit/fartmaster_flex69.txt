It's definitely easier to push the buttons and look at the screen of the device with the USB cable. It would be really painful to have to try to contort your body to interact with the dongle if it were plugged straight into a USB port.

The original USB cable (the little pink guy I got) is definitely too short. The updated one that's been included is about perfect I think.  


I love the size, but agree there should be an option for a larger screen for those of us who are aging. I love that the Trezor fits perfectly inside its foam cutout inside an Altoids tin.

I wasn't real happy with the reviews I had read around the web on the Trezor, so I wrote this one up as soon as I received mine today. Overall I love it, and is easy enough for almost anyone to use (68% of the population), and effectively turns your computer into a super efficient bank.

Everybody's got a different tolerance for risk, but I'd say if the cost of the Trezor is 10% or so of your total holdings it is probably a good idea to pay for the extra security - especially considering it is a fixed cost that can be amortized over a period of years.

Firefox works perfect for me, I would try that instead of Chrome.

Unless you're really doing something that adds value to their organization or their sales and marketing efforts, a tiny startup with a very high quality product and limited inventory competing in a niche market is not really the place to look for discounts and coupons.

It works the same way as Electrum, you can restore your entire wallet just with the keywords that are generated during setup.

Too hardcore for testnet, I use real coins for my experimentation ;)  Tried a few small transactions and it worked perfect.
