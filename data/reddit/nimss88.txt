Hmm this somewhat makes sense, thanks. 
I have bitcoin, but which I purchased at ~$10k, for me, I would be at a huge disadvantage using this money for anything, and it’s probably best to just hodl till I can’t hodl anymore, do you agree? Is there anything else I can do besides hodl?

Ok let’s take this a step further with a more realistic example - you bought a camera worth $300 USD. Brand new and unopened, you realize you don’t need it and want to resell it to someone in bitcoin. Obviously you don’t want to sell it for less than what you paid for, how would you price it in bitcoin? 
I would assume you’d do the conversion to know how much it would cost in bitcoin before offering it to anyone. Next day, someone sees your post about it and agrees to purchase it, but the value of bitcoin in relation to the USD has dropped significantly. Are you still going to sell it at the price you originally asked for? I’d be surprised if you say yes, but if so, please explain.

Because it’s not as volatile and the changes are not noticeable

No, according to facts.
Tell me how much the US dollar changed in the past 4 years then tell me how much bitcoin changed in the past year or two. Hell, you can tell me how much Bitcoin changed in the past week.

This is one of bitcoin’s (or cryptocurrency’s) biggest issues - people are having a very hard time understanding the basics although there is a plethora of material out there to read up on, and talks going on about it almost on a daily basis. When people can’t understand it, they can’t trust it, therefore, I doubt we’ll be seeing a comeback.
