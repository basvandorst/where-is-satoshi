Fair point! I remember being the only person in my company to have an email address. Now my fridge has one. Insane.

What makes you say that?

Haha. I’ll def look into it. Your comment confused the fuck out of me. Just not sure how it keeps the price steady if you don’t actually need to own anything in corn/Bitcoin. But I’ll look it up!

As the article suggests though, isn’t this possibly a bad thing? People will now be gambling on Bitcoin failing.

Interesting concept. Name is atrocious but hey, what do I know. I’ll deffo sign up. Good luck.

Well I was Person of the Year in 2006, so totally possible.

Very true! My point was more how feasible would it be for people to cash out to fiat. But you never know!

Ah right! Admittedly I don’t quite understand the futures market. Might have to look into it. Good luck though!

Honesty, I wonder how it can get that high at all. If one coin was worth 100k then it’d start to really affect currencies around the world right? How would people be able to cash out? There’s no way it could be used as currency to that decimal level, unless everyone started using ‘bits’.

If you could let me know or some for the UK then that would be great. CB using the Faster Payments service is brilliant.

Coinbase is a great on ramp for many until there’s more adoption. It’s necessary.

Kraken is a nightmare when it comes to Swift deposits. At least Coinbase can take debit card payments, that’s key for the masses. 
I’ll have a look at Bisq though

Give me another site in the UK with buying as easy as Coinbase.
