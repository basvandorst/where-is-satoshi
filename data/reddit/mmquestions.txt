Solid idea. Im keeping an eye on these sites now and its crazy Ill refresh and it suddenly goes from a loss to a few dollar gain. 
Just hope this shit doesnt die suddenly....

Haha well I dont want to throw it away, I would like to just take a risk on something that may earn me money. Maybe I'll post on stocks and see if they have some random advice. Idk. Investing is a tough one.

a person that makes silly jokes. i collect people like that and sell them into poorly researched investments =)
@_date: 2014-03-20 23:11:00
Yeah I get that part, I know what it is, and I'm learning more now, its just a matter of if its already past that point of rising and being a good investment or not. Like if I had done this a year ago I know i'd be pretty set if I had sold it at the right time a few months ago... 
Im not interested in using it to actually buy stuff at this moment I just wanna see if I can make any money from it or at least take the gamble.
@_date: 2014-03-20 23:00:39
Idk where the market is ill try to figure that out.
@_date: 2014-03-20 23:37:21
Where is it at now?
@_date: 2014-03-21 00:06:48
I am not really, but I'll try to learn more about it. 
@_date: 2014-03-20 23:00:25
Okay Im looking at that. I basically have some friends that know a little bit about it but no ones really all that educated about it so yeah definitely the first step.
I dont need something thats guaranteed like honestly this is not a life saving type deal, its money that I can honestly put into this and then just forget about it for a year and what happens happens. If its 50/50 on even merely doubling or leaving with nothing I'd take it. 
I'm also concerned about that whole stealing shit ive read about so I gotta find how to back up the coins and keep them

isee, this makes sense, but its crazy to believe some people actually were like yeah wow lets buy bitcoins for 1,200 just a few months ago!
@_date: 2014-03-20 23:35:23
Dogecoin supporters do not claim to be the silver to Bitcoin’s gold or attempt to make any arguments (other than “such wow”)
made me lol hard. Hmm so this is confusing me now again, now 3 people are going yeah invest vs the one that said naw.
@_date: 2014-03-21 00:05:34
Couldn't I just google how to get em back to exchange? Hm. Im not a programmer haha I am an artist. So yeah. Im still not set on if I wanna buy like, 100 bux of this or just do nothing..
@_date: 2014-03-20 23:37:01
I dont really wanna do the skype meeting stuff but if you helped over PM I'd definitely send you something in btc if I understood how to do that. but idk. I can google the paper wallet thing thats not a big deal, its more just figuring out should i go with 300 dollars worth of this stuff, where, how, how long should i wait, where do i keep track of the rising and falling of the price, etc.
@_date: 2014-03-21 00:05:47
Any suggestions where I can invest?
@_date: 2014-03-21 00:54:28
ahh thanks
@_date: 2014-03-23 00:52:43
So if I sold my bitcoin for 20,000 it means some dude literally bought it and thought it was worth 20,000 at the time.
Okay. Weird. TY!
@_date: 2014-03-21 00:15:54
THEY SHALL PART LIKE THE RED SEA.
I dont know what to dooooooo maybe ill just do nothing with this money. I just wanna take an educated risk tho.
@_date: 2014-03-21 00:10:36
I don't know anyone who knows that stuff, and I figure the internet is the best source of a ton of people trying to figure out shit so if anyone knows, its probably somewhere on reddit. Could be wrong. IDk. I wouldnt just jump in if you said jump, but at least itd give me something to start from for more research.
