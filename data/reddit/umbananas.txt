The only issue with your reasoning is you are confusing Bitcoin with Bitcoin protocol.

If you are afraid about them digging too deep, then you might as well just pay whatever they ask.
And I am sure they already dug up some previous unreported transactions.
@_date: 2014-04-14 19:45:26
The problem is unless you bought bitcoins at a much lower price, chances are regular people are not going to pay $460 today just to have a bitcoin in case they need to buy something.
So the situation of "once you have bitcoin" is highly unlikely to happen for most people.

A changing transaction ID is a big no no. But you kinda understand why it changes due to it's distributed nature.
They really should not call that a transaction ID if it changes.

wow.... what is that.

actually it is. Let's say there are 10 people who want cryptocurrency.
So here comes "bitcoin" building on the bitcoin protocol, then those 10 people would have no choice but to use "bitcoin".
But then there come "Dogecoin" which builds on the same bitcoin protocol. some of that 10 person might switch to "Dogecoin" instead.
Not saying "Dogecoin" would immediately split the market 50/50, but at least "bitcoin"'s market share is no longer 100%. And the supply of cryptocurrency is no longer 21 million.
by the end of the day these cryptocurrencies performs a function. If Dogecoin or litecoin can perform the same functions, why not?
@_date: 2014-04-15 20:24:47
why the down vote, it's already happening.
it's really just a matter of time before other cyptocurrencies gains traction.
@_date: 2014-02-18 22:03:28


isn't part of bitcoin's feature is that every transaction is traceable?
@_date: 2014-04-15 20:08:58
Bitcoin = MSFT or GOOG
Cryptocurrencies = Stock market

yes, same deal when your company awards you shares of the company. You pay tax based on the current share price.

If you are not an Apple authorized re-seller you are not supposed to be selling any Apple products. just saying...
@_date: 2014-03-07 16:09:57
While it's cool that you can track every transaction in bitcoin, but isn't it kinda creepy?
Most likely they are selling the bitcoins to pay off debts. If you are a customer, you are the least of their concerns right now.
@_date: 2014-04-08 19:34:38


How is this any different from bitcoins?
@_date: 2014-04-09 15:43:16


That's like saying There can be infinite smartphones, but that does not affect the demand for iPhone.

Your landscaper's like how about cash and no transaction fees.
@_date: 2014-06-26 19:29:33
a more appropriate answer would be "I don't know".
@_date: 2014-04-08 19:44:22


not if someone launches another "bitcoin" currency like litecoin.
Bitcoin fans are too hung up on "there can only be 21 million bitcoins", but forget the reality that there could be more than one cryptocurrency built on the bitcoin protocol.
@_date: 2014-10-09 16:01:09
So what does that have anything to do with the price of bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-06-26 17:05:14
I do not trust people who focus on the price of bitcoin instead of it's utility.
@_date: 2014-02-19 04:44:39
I think Google would be very interested in that kind of data.
Just imagine, the ability to trace down every single payment information in the bitcoin "network".
@_date: 2014-04-11 21:01:46
The bitcoin community reminds me a lot of the Linux community.
A lot of elitists who believe they know more than the rest of the world.
@_date: 2014-07-29 21:19:54
just like you can't pay IRS in stock certificates, you can't pay IRS in bitcoins.
@_date: 2014-04-09 14:45:54
Supply and demand. Exactly why I said you are only right if there can only be one crypto currency. But the reality is. There is already more than one, and there will be more in the future. 
@_date: 2014-05-09 16:26:02
That's probably what it's doing. But doesn't that kinda defeats the purpose of Bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-07-14 17:32:09
I can almost see all the bitcoin enthusiasts high fiving each other at the Bitcoin Conference after this speech, while the rest of the world moves on.
@_date: 2015-01-14 18:18:37
It's simple, people lost interest. 
As a consumer there is nothing that makes me want to use bitcoin over other types of payments.
Every time bitcoin crashes, it's not able to recover to where it was before. At this point even the speculators are losing interest.
@_date: 2014-04-15 22:46:57
people like you are blind the fact that Bitcoin is not and will not be the only game in town.

How do they guarantee it's going to worth 50 SGD by the time the user redeems the card?
@_date: 2015-04-21 15:37:37
when bitcoin goes from almost nothing to $1000, it's completely rational, becasue it'll eventually be $10k.
When USD goes from $72 to $100, OMG the sky is falling.
@_date: 2015-04-14 19:38:55
people were saying it'll be $10k so even if you buy ay $1200 you can still potentially make $8800.... :D 
Now that people are saying it might go below $200, so maybe this is the bottom. But you never know, with it's trading volume, it could go up or down thanks to one trader.

comparing bitcoin's price fluctuation to USD or EURO or any official fiat currency is simply stupid.
When exchange rate of USD goes down, cost of tons of other things goes down with it.
When price of Bitcoin goes down, well.... your purchasing power goes down.

In recent years Li Ka Shing has been investing a lot in Europe. Selling or spinning off a lot of his "old" businesses in Hong Kong. So I don't think he has a lot of understanding from the Chinese government. The Chinese government is known for not very trust worthy anyway. So don't read too much into this. He is investing in the tools that enables accepting bitcoin, not bitcoin itself.

if there are 234 billion that goes through the btc economy a year, then the total Bitcoins net worth really needs to be 27 million (an hour) in order to handle 234 billion a year. :)

This a country where there are thousands of mega rich people trying to get trillions of dollars out of China with Bitcoins. Now they can't do that anymore. Use your imagination, imagine what could be bigger than this.
@_date: 2013-12-18 21:12:48
you'll be surprised how much money you could make from taking bribes.
@_date: 2013-12-19 21:44:48
That's not a conspiracy theory. Anyone who has done any business in mainland China would know.
@_date: 2013-12-26 23:20:17
This is not a big move.
@_date: 2013-12-18 21:30:02
You know why they gamble with suitcases of cash? because they take bribes in cash, that's the only way they can store it.
With bitcoin they can store it and move it out of the country, easier than going to Macau.
@_date: 2013-12-18 22:34:13
Chinese are NOT not eager to find loopholes. Bitcoin IS the loophole, and now it's essentially closed.
