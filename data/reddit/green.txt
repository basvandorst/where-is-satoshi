1. Best Android phone that is cheap are:
- Moto X = $349.99
- Moto G = $179.00
2. You can buy it directly on their website or on ebay for cheaper. P.S just buy it on their website fresh and new
3. Ebay is the best way to sell it or a escrow website that will give you bitcoins for it.
Trust me making the switch from a iphone to a moto X will be the best decision you ever made. Moto G is as good as the Moto X.

I applaud your effort but Knowledge alone wont really help...
What is needed is for Restaurants, Bars, Markets, Clubs, Lounges, Rooftop Lounges, and Movies to all be on board with accepting bitcoins which will attract tourist and outside citizens to spend more money within Detroit.

I haven't heard anything bad about BOA, but it would be nice to get more feedback pertaining to BOA
@_date: 2014-04-11 14:57:22
Ahh, how hard was it to resolve the issue with BOA?
@_date: 2014-04-11 02:13:09
Was that after or before the whole issue with gox?
@_date: 2014-05-18 17:58:55
Seems like it might happen though

Simple answer is, people are selling out of fear
