Apart from Tim being a troll, why does a blockchain need a token if it is only computed by trusted nodes? I can think of many problems for which it could be a very effective solution.

As a rule Japanese bankruptcy courts do liquidate all the goods and do not split these among creditors.
What will happen with these bitcoins, we don't know. Even if all the bitcoins are given back to creditors, depending on the percentage of the selling afterwards it could still have a high impact on the markets.

"extrapolation is the process of estimating, beyond the original observation range, the value of a variable on the basis of its relationship with another variable.

Today I paid with my visa at the supermarket! It was just magic! Swapped the card and made the purchase instantly! I had no cash with me, it saved my day! What an amazing experience, I just wanted to share it with you! Thank you visa. You have made me a buyer for life.
