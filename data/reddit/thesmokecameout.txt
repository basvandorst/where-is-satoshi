Shitcoins have been bleeding for the last ten months.  The entire premise for "investing" in them was that they would replace Bitcoin.  None of them outside of the top five have any chance of that (even the top five don't, but they at least probably won't drop to zero tomorrow as long as Vitalik can do another hard fork to fix another bug), so the premise has proven false and people are gradually waking up to that.
If I had a satoshi for every time I've seen someone comment "my shitcoin needs to moon before I can sell, I'm down 90%" I'd have more Bitcoin than Satoshi Nakamoto ever mined.

It's not "new rules", it's the same rules that have been in place for decades.


Despite what a lot of LARPing shitheads here on and other subreddits and other websites have pretended, there has never been a "like kind exchange" rule for cryptocurrencies.  Every trade has ALWAYS been taxable.  So, either you listened to the LARPing shitheads or you didn't do even the most basic of research.  Sucks to be you, but **nothing changed**.

So, I found her website:
She has a few videos on YouTube in addition to the book and some blog posts.  It looks like she covers both legal and technical issues.  I don't know how in-depth her technical understanding is, but she has a bachelor's degree in business-related programming.
It's probably worth noting that she and Andreas Antonopoulos have done some stuff together, and in fact he wrote the foreword to her above book.
It's also worth mentioning that merely "leaving" your keys to people you want to get your Bitcoin isn't really enough in a legal sense.  You should follow proper estate planning if you don't want the courts to step in and demand that your designated heirs hand over their ill-gotten gains to the credit card company you stuck with an overcharged card, or to the IRS for unpaid back taxes.  That means using such tools as trust funds, unless you want your heirs to have to worry about getting hunted down and sued every time they buy a cup of coffee out of your LN wallet.

The book very clearly is NOT talking about PayPal, because PayPal is a centrally controlled clearinghouse, nothing more.  They don't need long prime numbers, and they can confiscate assets any time they want, and frequently do -- sell something, have the other person even joke about the transaction being for guns or gun parts, and you will be banned from PayPal;  they freeze your funds for six months, and you might not get them back.  Have a buyer claim you shipped defective merchandise (even if you didn't) and they'll undo the transaction, even if it means going into your attached bank account and sucking funds out of it.

No it isn't, it's just more of the same FUD.  The documents in the case have already proved that Tether was fully funded when all of this nonsense started two years ago, and remained fully funded up to the point where the Polish government seized Bitfinex's bank deposits.
Literally the only thing causing Tether to be "made out of thin air" is this ongoing court persecution, which is a blatant attempt to damage the cryptomarkets in order to further U.S. government interests (specifically, not seeing the USD replaced by alternative settlement mechanisms outside of U.S. control).

Umm, actually, yes, there is.  Any bankruptcy court (MtGox, for example) will deal with them.  They will treat the debts according to whatever contracts are in place and how their national laws require those to be interpreted.  That may mean the value of the debt gets converted into local currency, and the debtor has to pay out some apportioned amount in the end, but the courts WILL deal with Bitcoin.
If you want a legal process that will absolutely honor all Bitcoin amounts as Bitcoin, just write a contract with a mandatory arbitration clause.  Your debtor may end up in bankruptcy court to escape an arbitration award that went against her, but you knew that risk going in.

It also makes sense why Trump is now trying to get the Fed to cut rates -- Brexit will weaken the euro too, not just the pound, thus strengthening the dollar, and he wants the Fed to get ahead of that curve, not react after the fact.

Why do you care what others have done?  Buy or buy not.
I assumed that most web services would want an instant, irreversible micropayments system.  File storage sites, newspapers, camsluts, anything that has basically zero marginal cost and has trouble with monetizing their services because why would I want to pay a recurring monthly cost of $36.99 (not even joking, they really want that much once you're past the low low introductory price) for the WSJ when I look at two or three editorials?  Screw 'em, I'll just use an archive site backdoor for free.  And the file storage sites are even worse -- their model is currently "shove viruses onto people's computers in the name of advertising".
I did some back of the envelope math and figured that if such sites went to a fee-for-use model -- per article for the WSJ, or per download for the file storage sites -- they could make more money, not destroy people's computers, and drive Bitcoin to $25K/unit by 2020.
Almost none of the sites have bothered to implement such a system.  It's still at a "give us a huge chunk of money for a month's access" and "hijack people's computers for botnets" stage.  Yet here we are.  I still hope they'll wake up.

That's not how lithium polymer batteries, such as are used in smartphones, work.  You should be starting to charge at about 30% and stopping charging at about 70%.  The midrange is where battery life isn't reduced as much;  both ends cause migration and therefore damage your battery.

If your Bitcoins were on an exchange, make sure the exchange still exists and hasn't stolen everything and disappeared.
Alternately, if you sent the Bitcoins to an address (begins with 1 or 3) where you have the private key for it (private key begins with a 5), use the PUBLIC ADDRESS (begins with 1 or 3) to look it up on any of the various blockchain explorers such as blockchain.com:
for an example of a well-known public address.  Just substitute your public address (usually begins with a 1 unless you did something fancy like multisignature in which case it would begin with a 3) for the "1snow..." above.
That tells you how much you have on that address.
After that, in order to collect the various forks, you should first move your Bitcoins to a new address, and then go figure out how to move the BCash and BSV to exchanges that will cash you out on them.  The reason for moving your Bitcoins to a new address is so that a replay attack can't be used against you to rob you of all the BTC.  That is a common scam that has cost unwary travelers their fortunes.

It's when someone wants to make a change that isn't compatible with the existing implementation.

[As an example, a soft fork was done to repair a critical bug in Bitcoin back in 2010](
Nowadays, more commonly, it's a scam (Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin SV, Bitcoin Diamond, Bitcoin Gold), and sometimes it's done in such a way that they can try to steal your Bitcoin if you try to collect the forked coins.

It's no different from putting it on any other SD card or any other computer.
Be aware that the RasPi tends to eat SD cards due to using the cards for swapping, and because any sudden power loss or non-gentle shutdown can leave the boot card corrupted.
The Pi itself does not have drive encryption by default.  You would need to use TrueCrypt or similar.  There is a build for the Pi, but it has some bugs, in particular it does not play well with hidden containers.
I don't know about the more recent version of the Pi, but the early version did not have any sort of BIOS memory, so that is one less attack vector for viruses to use.
Pi 3 and Pi 4 have serious heat buildup problems.  Their processors regularly have to slow down so that they don't fry themselves.  Add-on passive cooling is barely sufficient on the Pi 3;  the Pi 4 requires active cooling.
They STILL don't have a 64-bit OS out.  Which means that half of the transistors in the CPU are just there to generate waste heat. . . .

Store your keys on multiple encrypted hard drives.  Give the drives to multiple different lawyers to be held in trust for your heirs.  Give your heirs the passwords.
If you're really paranoid, you can use multiple layers of passwords and something like Shamir's Secret Sharing to make it impossible for any one heir to corrupt any one lawyer and steal everything.  Make it so that at least two heirs have to cooperate, or at least two lawyers, or both -- depending on how many heirs you have, and how many lawyers you want to pay to hold on to your drives.
Note also, don't use SSDs or flash drives, use plain old ordinary spinning-disk hard drives.  Flash memory dies if left unpowered for long.  Even a few months can be enough to render it useless.

1. Bitcoin could in the future provide instant borderless micropayments for use on the web, such as reading news sites (WSJ, NYT), using filesharing sites (k2s.cc, mega.nz), using porn sites (too many to bother listing), and so on.
2. See above.  I would have zero problem paying a thousand sats to read a WSJ article, rather than their current model of "give us your credit card number so we can set up recurring $37/month billing for access to our site."  I read maybe three of their op-eds a month.  I'm not paying $12 per op-ed.  They lose out, I either skim the intro (which they post as a teaser) or find the whole article copied elsewhere.
3. There are existing escrow sites.  Merchants and buyers can voluntarily use them.

Several years from now, having hodled while the price moons, and finally wanting to buy your Lambo, you will (legally speaking) need to report the gain and pay taxes on that, using the price you reported in this year's taxes as your basis cost.

What's to discuss?  The mechanism has already been laid out.  People will pay mining fees, just as they already are, to have on-chain transactions included in a block.  Those mining fees will be a sufficient incentive to get miners to do their thing.
If the value of one unit of Bitcoin is low, then miners with expensive electricity will shut off their mining computers, and the remaining low-cost miners will secure the network.
If the value of one unit of Bitcoin is high, then everyone and their cats will buy mining rigs and dogpile on to mine, thus securing the network.
Either way, the network is secured.

That doesn't matter.  I was giving those numbers as an example.
If you got even one confirmation, then that means your transaction made it into a block.  Every ten minutes on average is another "confirmation", unless the entire Bitcoin network freezes and dies.
According to your post text and time it has now been 31 hours "or so".  That means your transaction has gotten roughly 189 "or so" confirmations by now.
If your wallet is reporting that nothing has happened, then either you've downloaded scamware that has stolen your Bitcoin, or it's buggy software.

TA works in the stock market because millions of stock traders -- including an enormous percentage of big traders, and especially 100% of "quant funds" -- make trades based on it.
TA doesn't work in Bitcoin because everyone is buying it either to hodl, hide, or use.  Even the hedge funds that are into it are buying it for long-term potential, not two-minute-chart price movements.
Long term, if it succeeds the price will be based on global economic trends.  If global trade is up, the Bitcoin value will move up.  If global trade is down, the value will drop.

It's a huge FUD campaign to pretend that Tether has been used to spike the price of Bitcoin.  The FUD has been going on for about three years now.
's comment about "fractional reserve" has been getting made since the start, and yet it was proven absolutely false by the filings in the NYAG case against Bitfinex.  That was ok with the FUD campaigners, though -- they just moved their fake goalposts to claim that *now* Tether wasn't fully backed -- because multiple national governments had conspired to seize Bitfinex's cash account from a bank they'd forced it to move to, claiming it was "drug money laundering", and voila, suddenly because of the governments' seizure of the funds, it's now magically a "fractional reserve" and a complete fraud all along.

Pamela Morgan wrote a book about how to do it:
Please note that you don't ONLY have to make sure that your keys aren't lost, you also have to make sure that whoever inherits it either knows how to manage things or at least doesn't get ripped off by whoever you designate to help, and also that whoever inherits does so in a way that the law recognizes as legal.
Do be aware that tax-wise, "step up basis" is your great and wonderful friend.  Your heirs won't owe any taxes as long as the amount is under whatever limit your government sets (IIRC, federally, it's five million dollars in the U.S., but that may have changed or I may be mistaken -- also note that states vary).
If you have a lot, talk to a lawyer to make sure you handle it properly.  Politicians love to bloviate about how they're going to "fix the system" but the reality is that nobody pays estate taxes unless they don't ever plan on how to manage things.  For example, James Gandolfini fucked up royally, never planned on croaking, and so his estate ended up paying millions in totally unnecessary taxes, all because he was stupid.  If he'd set up a trust, his heirs would have paid zero in taxes.

Do you actually hate them, or are you just paranoid that they'll do something stupid and tell everyone about them and get you all tortured to death?
You can use timelocked keys for inheritance -- send your BTC to a multisig address with one normal key (that you keep) and one timelocked key that is only spendable two years from now.  Before the two years are up, if you're still alive, move them to a different multisig address with the same setup.
Meanwhile, you give the timelocked keys to your wife.  She knows that the stuff is there, but can't touch it.  If you don't trust her to keep her mouth shut, put them in an envelope and give them to a law firm to turn over to her in the event of your death, and tell her to contact them if you croak.
There are many other strategies.  Pamela Morgan's book, "Cryptoasset Inheritance Planning", goes over some of them.

It's not so much that the businesses control the supply (except in the case of diamonds) as that they have to go out and find new deposits.  Also, it costs a certain amount of money to extract from existing deposits, and if the cost is higher than the current price, then (just like Bitcoin miners) they have to choose between shutting down or mining at a loss in the hope of a price rebound.

In a real estate transaction, escrow protects both buyer and seller.  The seller wants to make sure he gets the money, the buyer wants to make sure he gets the house.  You won't escape escrow just by using Bitcoin, because the buyer wants that protection too.
Then there's the issue of volatility.  What happens when the price jumps 40% in two days?  Does the buyer suddenly back out (and probably lose his earnest money, which would be a tiny fraction of the difference)?  How about when the price drops 20% in two days?  Does the seller get to say "send more Bitcoin or the deal's off!"?  Maybe in a decade the price will have stabilized enough that this won't be an issue, but we're not there yet.  Meanwhile, the escrow process ensures that the proper amount of funds gets transferred.
Writing a bunch of blockchain trivia into the sales contract isn't going to solve the problem.  On a major purchase like that, people want assurances and protections.  Bitcoin solves only one single problem out of dozens.

Depends on what country you are in.  Some care, some haven't woken up yet, some aren't competent enough to figure it out.


If you are displaying a Bitcoin address at which you can accept payments/"tips", then all they have to do is look at that address to see how much has been sent there.
If you're sending out individualized payment addresses to people who are buying your stuff, then it becomes harder for a government to track your income, but it is still possible, either through monitoring your email or by making test buys themselves to build a case against you for not reporting income.
You might consider opening a foreign corporation that owns your intellectual property in a country that does not tax IP revenue, routing all Bitcoin payments to that corporation, and keeping your profits overseas.  Again, if you're in the U.S., there are some tax issues with IP created inside the U.S. and then assigned to foreign business entities because of recent federal legislation (the "GILTI" section of the 2017 tax act);  contact a tax attorney to discuss how to handle IP income under that, especially if you do the "digital nomad" thing and go live in, say, Ireland while churning out your porn.

There's no such thing as "getting stuck at only 3 confirmations".  A "confirmation" is simply another block being mined on top of the one that your transaction is already in.  If you had three confirmations an hour ago, then on average you have nine now, fifteen in another hour, 147 in a day, and so on and so on and so on.
There can be long periods where no blocks get mined, since the timing is random, but nothing just gets "stuck".  Unless of course Bitcoin as a whole suddenly dies and shuts down.

Nonsense.  That's a meme spouted by shitcoiners who hope that they'll become multibillionaires when their piles of useless shitcoins suddenly replace Bitcoin.  The high fees died when Jihan Wu gave up on spamming the network to try to force BCash on everyone.


Say what?  The only three cryptocurrencies I've ever seen accepted in the wild are Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Ethereum.  Monero has a niche in illegal drug purchases.  Tether is being used for some international payments where currency controls are a problem.  That's about it.  Of those five, Bitcoin is by far the leader -- which also ties directly to his crap about Bitcoin not being "saleable" compared to, say, MaidSafeCoin.


If they ban Bitcoin, all of the others will be banned too. Sure, maybe you can hide your use of them better, but all that will happen is that people caught using them for anything will get made examples of.  And just as with child pornography sites, where the FBI sets up stings, governments will set up cryptocurrency stings to lure out the people hiding them.


It's pretty clear he failed economics when he doesn't realize that the only reason miners are "wasting electricity" on Bitcoin is because it's valuable.  If they can't cover costs, they won't mine it.  Literally any other cryptocurrency, if it is worthwhile to mine, miners will build more mining rigs and use more electricity until the cost of production just barely is covered by the income generated.  That's how oil production works, that's how gold mines work, that's how literally every extractive industry works.
Considering that he failed at understanding such a basic concept, I can't see much value in any of the rest of what he wrote.

Neither of those options is any good for long term storage.  Anything that uses flash memory will, if left idle, slowly leak charge over time and eventually become unreadable.  The time scale can be as low as a few weeks and as long as a couple of years, but they all WILL go bad.  It's not "may die", it's "will die", and it's not "some", it's "all."  That is simple physics.
Not only that, but flash memory that is regularly used will fry itself eventually too.  Way back when they claimed 100,000 write cycles;  now I'm seeing more like 10,000 being claimed, and I've had drives fry themselves in weeks because the fault distribution is a "bathtub distribution".

To the extent that this infringes the owner's copyright, it is illegal, but the owner would have to sue some random anonymous person on the internet, and unless the owner timely filed for registration he couldn't collect statutory damages, so only actual economic losses would apply.  Then of course the random anonymous person being sued (hereinafter, "defendant") could claim "fair use".  In this case, of the four fair use factors, only the substantiality factor is to the plaintiff's benefit;  the other factors are either neutral or detrimental to the plaintiff -- it is clearly being done for educational use / commentary / not for profit, and its use arguably spreads the work to people who may not otherwise have heard of the artist thus INCREASING its value;  the nature-of-the-work factor is a wash.

Doesn't matter if you sell or not, or even if you know about it or not -- you suddenly "received value" and therefore you have to pay tax on it.
So, tax liability can strike you at any time, anywhere, without your knowledge or action or even consent.
If the value of the shitcoin then plunges, your only recourse would be to immediately dump it and take a loss.  Better do it within the same tax year if you don't want to have to pay taxes and then only be able to carry over losses until you sell something.
And there is no clarity on what such things as the UASF mean, or what to do in the event that  the main chain is forced to do a hard fork to correct something -- like what happened when that bug creating millions of Bitcoin got fixed in 2010.

So, that's very clear.
This touches on what is most infuriating about all the "the science is settled!" retards in the Global Warming "debate" -- they generate MODELS, and then when the MODELS get proven wrong (e.g., through "The Pause"), they just generate a NEW MODEL and say "See, THIS one backtests, so the science is still settled!!!!"
No, people, that's not how fucking computer-generated models work.  That's how they're proven to be WRONG.  The fact that EVERY SINGLE CLIMATE MODEL SO FAR has eventually been proven wrong doesn't make your new-improved-fresh-scent-barely-tweaked model magically correct.

The places that have chosen to accept Bitcoin for payments have done very well off it.  Overstock, Protonmail, Wikileaks, to name just a few.
There is little risk of "lose 50% of its value in a week" if a company only holds on to it long enough to process the payment and shop the Bitcoin off to an exchange.  If the company wants to hold on, they can hedge against losses using futures contracts -- which is exactly what futures contracts such as Bakkt and CME were invented for, hedging against commodities price fluctuations.

Buyer sends payment, seller says "fuck off!"
Buyer sends payment, seller delivers a trashed property.
Buyer sends payment, house gets destroyed by a tornado before transfer can be completed.
I think the single dumbest one I ever saw was that the sale went through, and the seller said "nothing in the contract tells me that I have to move my mobile home trailer off the land, I'm stayin' right here."  (Yeah right Bubba, good luck with that argument in court.)
Bitcoin solves absolutely none of these issues.  Payment is arguably the least important, most trivial aspect of the whole thing.

There's a major difference between someone driving a fancy car and living in an expensive home, versus someone who has a hundred thousand dollars in "untraceable" cryptocurrency.
No one thinks about torturing you to death in order to get you to sign over the deed to your house.  If someone steals your Lambo for a joyride they know it's going to be hard to sell and hard to hide, so they'll probably just set it on fire as a big fuck-you to Richie Rich.
If you go around telling people you have a hundred thousand in cryptocurrency, there's really no downside to them in trying to steal it from you.  They can sell it privately in, say, Mexico or Argentina (current front page of the subreddit says Argies are paying a 38% premium to buy Bitcoin) and sit on the cash.  Maybe the cops will know which addresses were yours and they'll try to trace the transactions, and so if the buyer ever goes to an exchange to sell, say, two years from now, they'll ask him how he was involved in the horrific torture murder of you, and he'll say "Whaaaat?  I bought it off some guy at a bar who overheard me talking about Bitcoin and wanted to dump some."

But all of the stuff that the realtor (or Realtor^^TM ) does has absolutely nothing to do with finalizing the transfer of the payment and the property.

You have to find an on-ramp.
On-ramps include such services as Bitcoin exchanges such as Coinbase and Kraken and Gemini, smartphone apps such as CashApp, and Bitcoin ATMs.
The U.S. government (I'm assuming you're American) has told on-ramps that they have to do KYC/AML or else get prosecuted as "illegal money transfer businesses".
So, you can either find a friend who owns Bitcoin, buy some off said friend, and then send it, or you can jump through the KYC/AML hoops for one of the exchanges/apps/ATMs.
There are a very few Bitcoin ATMs that don't follow the rules, and you might still be able to find one around somewhere, I dunno.  Otherwise, your best bet is probably to ask friends and family.  Be careful if you do something like post on Craigslist, because there are an enormous number of scammers who will take your money and run, or who will insist that you set up an account on some website (Localbitcoins, for example) and use false information to scam you.
I'm just glad I got in before all this crap got forced on the ecosystem, because I absolutely never would have been able to navigate it today.

By the way, take all of those microSD cards and make backup copies of everything on them on a spinning-metal-platter hard drive.  Then back up the whole spinning-metal-platter hard drive onto another spinning-metal-platter hard drive.  You may as well encrypt the first one (Truecrypt, Veracrypt) and copy the encrypted container onto the second, just to be safest.  And don't forget the password.  Then move one of the drives offsite to some other building such as a bank safe deposit box.
SD cards and all other flash memory devices slowly bleed power and go corrupt.  This can happen in as little as a few weeks but usually takes months.

You also have a tax obligation (under the U.S. Internal Revenue Code) at the time that you receive Bitcoin, for the difference between the value of the BTC and the value of what you spent for it.
This means, for example, that miners have to pay tax when they find a block, for the value of the block, minus expenses such as electricity and depreciation of the mining rigs.
Outright gifts have different rules, I'm talking about barter exchanges above, which is what trading stuff for Bitcoin counts as in the U.S.  (Purchases for less than the true value also fall into this, to avoid e.g. parents "selling" property to their kids for $1.)

Ah, so it is you.  Some questions:


How does this differ from mining fees and the eventual fee market that Bitcoin will have to use in order to incentivize miners?


Do you think they will be allowed to launch?  The pushback from governments has been pretty strong.  In the U.S., I'm expecting the FTC to shred Facebook starting Real Soon Now.


As a "toxic maximalist cultist" this warms my heart, but do you really think that's even slightly feasible?  At least in the current national-currencies economic system, countries that do worse devalue their currencies to balance out their positions.  If everyone is 100% locked into Bitcoin as the sole universal currency, it will be like the EU today, where Greece and Italy are seeing their economies destroyed because they can't compete against the more efficient countries like Germany and they can't devalue to adjust their competitive position.

So, exactly what we *didn't* need -- because the only reason the mempool was bloating was that Bitmain's Jihan Wu was spamming transactions and intentionally mining empty blocks to try to bog things down in order to damage Bitcoin's reputation.  Which he probably would have continued to do as he became increasingly wealthy due to his Covert ASICboost exploit.  Eventually subverting and destroying the entirety of Bitcoin, because he would have continued his practice of secretly deploying ever more mining rigs to nearly completely control transactions, probably even to the point of being able to carry out 51% attacks whenever he wanted.
One of the absolute best arguments in favor of deploying SegWit was specifically to stop his abuses.  If you were around back then, you'll remember that it was only after his exploit was discovered and explained that people said "Oh, so that's why he's been stalling us for two years.  Fuck it, we're going to UASF and force the issue."
Meanwhile, even today, the mempool routinely empties out, because thanks to SegWit the block size has *effectively* been nearly doubled, and by enabling SegWit we've also gained a second-level scaling solution in the Lightning Network, and more others to come.
And BCash's big block capability is going unused (just like BCash in general), and BSV just mined a 210MB block that has caused its mining community to split into three camps because, surprise, not everyone has hardware capable of handling ever-increasing block sizes.

Because the U.S. government had lots of gold even before that?
Banks locked their safe-deposit vaults and would only open individuals' boxes for the first time in the presence of an IRS agent so that any coins could be confiscated.  Most people had their money on deposit in banks anyway, and suddenly couldn't withdraw gold coins, but rather only paper.
That was the extent of "compliance".  I'm sure some stupid assholes handed a few in voluntarily, but most people hid whatever gold they had left.

A former employer of mine wanted the Twitter handle for its own name.  That name had been grabbed up by someone who used it exactly once (to try to sell a single purchase he'd made from the company the first time the company ever shipped products) and then abandoned it. Despite being abandoned for multiple years and having initially been taken by someone who didn't have the right to be using the company's unique name/trademark (literally unique, it was a "coined" term) in that way, Twitter wouldn't touch that account's ownership rights.
At this point that Twitter handle has been abandoned for something like seven or eight years.

Whatever the software is, it's asking if you will accept a "that's close enough" payment instead of only a "that's exactly right" payment.
Last time I made a purchase using Bitcoin, BitPay would whine about OVERpayments but would accept them;  if an underpayment was made (e.g., didn't account for mining fees) then the whole transaction was rejected and you'd have to go through months of crap until the vendor sent you a refund via some separate channel.
This payment processing system, apparently named "Perfect Money", realized that this is sometimes a problem and has changed their setup to allow near-matches and even underpayments IF the vendor allows it.

Depends on whether they have any ownership rights in that money or not.
In the U.S., "Social Security" pretends to be a pension system even though it isn't.  15% of your income gets shoveled into it, and if you drop dead early, you get nothing back.  Your spouse and/or children might or might not qualify for residual benefits.
A friend of mine and his family immigrated to the U.S. in the 1980s.  His father worked for the next seven years until he got cancer and died.  The government kept every cent, because his father hadn't worked the magic ten years to qualify anyone for any benefits whatsoever.

Before you send any, make sure she can find someone who will buy the Bitcoin from her, and be sure she understands how to do the transfers.  She should get money in hand BEFORE sending the Bitcoin to someone else, otherwise there's no way to prevent the other person from refusing to pay her afterward.
Probably the easiest all around would be for you to be on the phone with her, confirm the other person has given her cash in hand, and then send the payment directly to the other person.  Be sure she's in a safe position when you do that, not somewhere where the other person can just turn around and rob her.
Note, you may want to send the payment in two stages -- first a tiny test amount to the address the person has given you, so that you can be sure it's worked correctly, and then the full remaining amount to the same address.

Is this someone you've done business with before?  Are you certain that it's really one of the people in authority at that company who is asking you to make payment via Bitcoin?  Are you certain they will deliver the products to you after you pay?
If any answer is "no", then you shouldn't pay with Bitcoin, because there is no way to recover your money if they defraud you, and because it is (effectively) anonymous, you have no real recourse with the police.  Not that you would have any in China anyway.
One of the very common scams in China is for an employee to contact the customer, give a fake new bank account number to send payment to, and then the customer sends the money and the ex-employee disappears into the wilderness.  There's also the "ship goods that aren't really to spec" scam and the "ship an empty box" scam, not to mention the "don't bother shipping anything at all" scam.

Doesn't matter.  Anyone can send Amazon a crate of "Ledger Nano S"es and Amazon will then mix those with all the legitimate ones from Ledger itself, sending them out at random to buyers no matter which seller a particular buyer is ordering from.
I used to work for a company that manufactured its own products and sold them through Amazon (among many other places).  We got counterfeits shipped to us when we did test buys from Amazon that were supposed to be "out of our own stock" -- because Amazon commingles every single fucking product that claims to be of the same type, even though they promise in their contracts that they don't do that.  Amazon lies.

BTW, the reason your comment got shit on in is because we're a bunch of "toxic maximalist cultists" and most people in the sub don't take the time to understand what someone is asking before going berserk.  So, suggesting the use of anything other than Bitcoin is immediately shit upon.
They don't bother to understand that you're asking about programming applications for somethingorother.
Someone posted a flow chart a few months ago showing all of the basic questions to ask to decide whether a blockchain is actually necessary for a project.  It almost never is.  You need to have a requirement for trustlessness, a way to incentivize participants, AND a decentralized community.  The moment you centralize decision-making, you absolutely kill any benefit from a blockchain.  If you cannot find a way to pay people to run the software (the mining block reward in Bitcoin) then there's no real point for anyone to join, you'll only get a small group of adopters, and consequently there is little to no obstacle to prevent someone to attack your consensus-based network.  These are just the base needs;  after that, you still have to figure out a way to get it all to work and be useful and get adopted.
Anyway, I really, REALLY don't understand the attraction of cramming "blockchain technology" into an "IoT" device for "fintech".  To me, it sounds like you swallowed and regurgitated a buzzword dictionary so you could excite technologically low-skilled investors who are incapable of evaluating your proposal.  But then again, I'm one of those old fuddy-duddies who doesn't see a need to connect my toaster oven to the internet so that it can reorder Pop-Tarts for me from Amazon after it's scanned just under a dozen RFID tags embedded in the strawberry flavored little pastries of joy (and calculated lead time for shipping and delivery in case we're approaching a weekend).  Maybe you've come up with something interesting and useful that will be transformative, and if so, good luck.  Just think long and hard whether you actually need to bother with a "blockchain" instead of just using a standard database like 99.99999999% of real world applications only need to bother with.

If your cost average is 7200, and the current price is 8000, just point out that you've made an 11% return in that time.  If your local currency is losing value (e.g., Turkey) then that return may be even better.

You forgot to add "that are in three different locations".  Three copies in one house is really just one copy and zero backups.
Also, "fireproof" safes are NOT HEATPROOF.  I remember a sad tale on rec.guns a couple of decades ago of some guy whose house burned down, and he finally dug out to his gun safe and opened it, and his registered-receiver M16 had MELTED.  Currently that would be $32,000 down the toilet, back then it was still around $80,000.
An internal safe temperature that gets hot enough to melt aluminum will pretty much vaporize the solder in your Ledgers.  At the very least it will destroy the flash memory.

Derivatives are not necessarily bad.  Call and put options are derivatives, and they're often used as a form of insurance against a precipitous decline, or as a way of betting on volatility.
The problems last time happened mainly because of three things: (1) they didn't think about the correlation of asset values when designing the derivatives, (2) the financialization disconnected the loans from the issuers so that the issuers had no "skin in the game", and (3) they split up the pieces in so many different random ways that it was impossible to undo the trades when the wheels started coming off.

To add to what wrote, only a few weeks ago a mining node did exactly that -- it miscalculated the block reward by adding the mining fees to the block reward amount.  I have no idea why they did something that stupid, but they did.
So, the network rejected that block and everyone got a chance to scoop up the block reward again.  (As it turned out, the same mining pool found the solution again, and didn't screw up the math this time.  Lucky them.)

No, the killer app of the internet was the World Wide Web.  You know, that thing you're viewing Reddit via.
Once upon a time, the WWW didn't exist, and the only people who knew about the internet were nerds who were downloading files over FTP and telling dirty jokes and sex stories on USENET.  Then Tim Berners-Lee wrote a simple SGML markup grammar, which he called HyperText Markup Language or HTML, to set up a generalized information sharing system at CERN, and other people started adopting it to share everything from physics papers to cat photos.  Then all the stupid normies who constantly shit on all of the nerds realized that they too could share cat photos.  Then the entire world suddenly realized that there was this thing called "the internet" and flooded in.

It won't.  Zuckerberg wants control and money and power.  He has US$45,000,000,000 to throw at marketing this to his existing base of 1,560,000,000 active daily users.  Most of those users willingly flaunt their personal information, from vacation plans to selfies to politics to hobbies to personal spending habits.
There are entire communities of criminals "friending" people on Facebook just to see when George Smith is taking his family on vacation, so that said criminals can go rob his house.  And the George Smiths of the world are too fucking stupid to realize that "friending" the hot 20yo supermodel babe whom they've never heard of before is just a scam to track their vacation plans.  But hey, they get to see "her" swimsuit photos, so it's all good, right?!!?!
Zuckerberg will have no problem convincing them that FacePay is totally privacy-oriented and won't share their data outside of the Facebook Partnership Network.
And Zuckerberg will have no problem strongarming business owners into accepting FacePay for their merchandise sold through Facebook, especially when he keeps the initial transaction fees low and tells them that they'd better join or else lose market share to their rivals.
Edit: look at PayPal after they hooked up with EBay.  Suddenly EBay made it almost impossible to transact without accepting PayPal -- and then they started cranking up the fees to ridiculous levels, banning entire classes of products, freezing people's accounts, and fucking over sellers constantly by invariably siding with "merchandise not as advertised! never received item!" scammers -- but people still use them because marketshare.

It wasn't just the fees, there were also confirmation time problems, and users were getting mad about the experience (because it was totally the businesses' fault that it was costing $50 in fees per transaction).  Transactions were never going through, users didn't like having to resubmit a transaction to buy something they thought they'd already paid for, ended up with both transactions going through after days or weeks, can't get refunds. . . .

Nope.  It means that miners will shut down rather than wasting electricity on pointless excessive capacity.
We don't need even a tenth of today's mining capacity for "securing the network".  The only reason we have it is because the block reward makes it so insanely profitable.  Name any other industry where you can plug in a computer and instantly start earning a 300% profit against the cost of your consumables.  Sure, you still have to amortize the cost of the capital goods (the mining rigs) but that's done after just a few months.

Whether or not you have to pay taxes depends on what country you're in, and possibly also what country you're from (if you're an expat).
Assuming the answer in your case is "USA" for either or both, you have to pay capital gains tax on the difference in price from when you bought to the price when you sell/exchange/trade/whatever.
The tax rate varies depending on how long between the events and also on how much income you are reporting in the tax year.
Assuming "back in the day" was more than one year earlier, you qualify for long-term capital gains.
If you can't remember, or can't prove, what your purchase cost was, you can use zero as your "basis cost".  This increases the amount of tax you owe, but if your gains are large enough it becomes pretty much irrelevant.  For someone who bought in, say, 2015, who has a 40:1 return, the additional tax amounts to less than half a percent of what's being cashed out.
But if you can prove the amount, then, say you bought at $250 and sold at $10,000, you would pay tax on $9750 in gains.  If you only made, say, $20K, your tax rate would be zero, because Trump's tax reforms raised the threshold for where cap gains kick in.  If you made $60K you'd pay 15%.  If you made more than something like $400K, you'd pay 20%.  Verify the rates and thresholds before you file, since these are just approximate guesses from memory.
Oh, if it's less than a year, you pay whatever rate you pay on your ordinary income.
Note that the tax is on each and every transaction.  If you're going to do a bunch of small ones, it might behoove you to instead cash out in one big lump sum and then use cash for your purchases.

By taking payments out of the hands of Bitcoin, it would suck the oxygen out of the Bitcoin universe.
People keep chanting dumb shit like "store of value!" and "digital gold!" without any comprehension of the fact that without being used in the economy, Bitcoin is just a colossal waste of storage and data and energy.  A bunch of bits on your hard drive has zero value unless someone else is willing to pay you money for them, or vice-versa.
Facebook could easily have said, "we're giving everyone access to Bitcoin!" instead and implemented an ecosystem based on that.  They didn't, because they want the control, the fees, and the transaction data.

If you absolutely have to have anonymity for some reason, just find a BTM and know you'll be paying 10% extra in fees.  Some day you'll look back and think "why did I care so much about a few pennies back then?"  Or maybe you'll think "Damn, I sure am glad I paid those ridiculous fees, since my ex-wife had no idea all this money exists!" or maybe ". . . because I'm not in prison like all those other guys who got caught."
If you're just avoiding exchanges because "OMG KYC!!!", why do you care?  Keep records and pay your taxes.

As far as Britain saying "res judicata, baby!", not gonna happen.  The U.S. court won't have proven that he isn't Nakamoto, only that Wright didn't prove that he is.  It can be used as persuasive evidence, but not as a proven fact.

What other solutions would have been preferable as the first step to have taken?
@_date: 2019-06-08 10:31:57
Take a look at Japan since 1990.  Their government refused to deal with reality when their banks failed after a giant property bubble popped.  Instead, their government buys its own bonds, corporate stocks, and anything else that they can get their paws on, to prevent losses from being incurred.  The government does this by "printing" money (which in today's world means making an entry in the central bank's database saying "we just printed another billion yen, and now we're spending it on bonds").
The result is a stagnant economy, artificially depressed interest rates, and MASSIVE inflation looming in the shadows.  When their asset bubble pops, it will wipe out their economy.
Guess what the Eurozone refused to do, and then what it did, after the 2008 economic bubble popped?
Guess what the Federal Reserve refused to do, and what it did, after the 2008 housing/economic bubble popped?
As for whom you should be outraged at, Ben Bernanke and Barack Obama would be a *great* start.  George W. Bush would be another -- he appointed Bernanke and his initial response paved the way for Obama's.  In the Eurozone, Merkel and Juncker and the ECB are all justifiable targets of your ire, as are Italy's and Greece's governments especially from the 2005-2008 period.

This is categorically false.  Any sort of exchange is a taxable event.
* If he sent BTC to a poker site that denominated betting in dollars, boom, taxable event.
* Winning session, boom, taxable event.
* Losing session, boom, has to be recorded as a deduction at the present fair market value.
* Withdrawing winnings as BTC from said poker site, probably already accounted for in the above possibilities.
About the only concession the IRS makes is that you can net the gains and losses across a single session -- but my experience on that is based on dollar-denominated real world Las Vegas gambling, so even that should be checked with a CPA who understands the IRS's cryptocurrency rules (as if anyone does yet, ha-ha).

What country are you in?  Someone mentioned Portugal, others are referencing the USA, but you haven't stated which one yourself.  In one of your other topics you mentioned a W-2G, so I'm guessing USA.
Anyway, you would be stuck paying ordinary income rates on gambling wins.  That's just how it is.  I hope you remembered to log all of your losses and deduct those.  Any capital gains you made by hodling before betting and winning/losing/selling would also need to be figured out and paid on -- and if your hold period was less than a year, I'm pretty sure you pay ordinary income rates on those too.
Your CPA should be the one to tell you all of this, though.  Tax is really a specialist's field.  I had a CPA do my taxes for the last several years, and there are all sorts of hidden rules and credits and exemptions.  If you're not comfortable with your current CPA, find another one to verify his work.  There's really not much point in asking on Reddit because half of this sub is filled with idiots who think they're going to get away with claiming like-kind exchanges or just ignoring taxes altogether.  Some of them seem to be spreading false information deliberately out of ideological bias, putting people at risk of penalties and maybe even criminal convictions.

Did you take the information from the government website and use the phone number from the government registration filings to call someone at the company's office and make sure they're really the ones sending you the bank transfers?
Did you then call a second person at the company, one who is in an executive position, and verify that the employee you talked to the first time isn't just doing it on her own time and pretending that the company is involved?
What you described sounds a lot like the Craigslist cashier's check scam -- someone "buys" your car with a cashier's check (in the U.S., these are supposed to be guaranteed by the issuing bank and therefore used to be considered a safe form of payment, but not any more).  The check is "oopsie" made out for more than what you'd agreed to sell them the car for, so you give them the difference in cash.  You give them the car, deposit the check, and three months later your bank tells you that the check was counterfeit and removes the money from your account.  You're now out one car plus the extra cash you gave them.  \

RasPi has a hard limit of 64GB for its boot microSD card.  This is in the firmware and cannot be changed.
You can buy a 512GB flash drive and plug it in, though.
The Pi's USB ports by default cannot deliver enough power to power an external hard drive.  I've tried.  *Edit: might work if you use an externally-powered external hard drive.* There is supposedly a configuration setting that will increase the power output, but I haven't tried it yet and wouldn't want to rely on it.

A few weeks ago I ran into a chart that gives the same pattern as Anonymous's numbers.  It's basically a chart of the last ATH scaled to the current market (shortened timeframe as well as price scaling).  I mean, it could happen, but it assumes a LOT, including that ZuckCoin (with all its marketing power from a few dozen major corporations) won't significantly affect the overall markets.
Also, I strongly disagree with his Bitcoin dominance guesstimate -- Bitcoin's dominance has been going up semi-steadily (with occasional big jumps and mild dips as the rest of the market tries to catch up) for months.  Currently it's 57.6% of everything and almost 63% of the top 20, and that's even after IFinex created a brand new top-20 "coin" just a couple of days ago as a sort of bond to pay off its we-got-hacked debts.
Then again, maybe that's *because of* the influence of ZuckBucks.  Hmmmmmm. . . .  Maybe I shouldn't disagree after all?

As a project, Litecoin is dead.  Go look up the leaked transcript from Charlie Lee's conference call with the foundation directors around three months ago.  He admits that the only person working on it any more is himself, that the other devs have either officially left or are just not bothering.
As a cryptocurrency, Litecoin still has value because of inertia and some small amount of use.  As these die, so will Litecoin.
This is a cautionary tale for Bitcoin.  Bitcoin still has a critical mass for development and use.  Development makes it possible to use, but use is what drives value.  Actual use in commerce.

Meanwhile, in Thailand, I've nearly gotten killed twice as a result of taxi drivers' stupid games, once in an accident and once when the stupid fucker decided to take me miles out of the way on the expressway at twice the speed of the rest of traffic -- all to run up the meter so that the trip would cost me the equivalent of US$3 (100 baht) instead of US$1.33.

Ripple is a demonstrator system run by some banks to show that they can implement things using "blockchain technologies".  When you hear about some company "using Ripple" what they are really talking about is setting up their own blockchain using the Ripple code base.

That sort of thing is common across a lot of professions.
For example, it's been known for over a hundred years that diabetes can be at least partially managed with a low-carb/zero-carb diet (type 2 can be controlled with it, type 1 benefits but still cannot do without insulin).  Licensed dietitians and medical doctors are required to advise patients based on what groups like the American Diabetes Association's guidelines recommend -- if they don't, then if the patient croaks, they can be held liable without benefit of insurance.  So, they don't tell patients "don't eat carbohydrates", instead they tell patients "take these pills and keep upping your insulin dosage until your feet fall off, you go blind, your kidneys fail, and you die."  Patients are told, "here's a pill, it will help a lot but you have to eat steady doses of carbs all day or else you'll go into a coma."  Patients are steered away from solutions like the keto diet.
Financial advisers likewise are required to recommend time-tested investments like mutual funds, stocks, bonds, Treasury bills, and certificates of deposit.  Telling people about wild new technologies and their buddy's perpetual-motion-machine invention are prohibited.  (Strangely, the industry doesn't give a fuck about money managers who destroy clients' entire net worths through active trading strategies and shitty high-fee products.)  If they recommend something weird and the client loses his shirt, the adviser can be sued and maybe even criminally prosecuted for breaching his fiduciary duties.

Aww nah brah, nah.
Altcoins took off because Bitcoin development got stalled during Jihan Wu's war against SegWit, done to preserve his "covert ASICBoost" scam. Their entire value proposition was "see, Bitcoin sucks, can't be used in real life, we'll replace it!"  And if Jihan Wu had succeeded with his FUD campaign, that's exactly what would have happened.
But he failed, so SegWit got activated, and now we have Lightning Network, and small transactions can be processed instantly and at almost zero cost.
Watching altcoins now, it's like watching sand running out of an hourglass -- on average they're all declining in value relative to Bitcoin, and pretty rapidly.
Remember, once upon a time, Bitcoin was 100% of the market.  Then Litecoin forked off and took some share.  Then a couple more projects started.  Then everyone started hearing about cryptocurrencies and suddenly every fast-talking idiot on the planet was pushing their own.  Bitcoin's market share plunged to something around a third of the overall market.
But then people caught on to Jihan's scam (the whole "covert ASICBoost" thing that allowed him to make a shitpile of money and centralize most of the mining) and forced SegWit.  Jihan overplayed his hand by forking BCash and trying to FUD everyone into moving over to it.  Then SegWit started functioning, and Lightning Network became possible, and now things are back on track.
August 2018: Bitcoin breaks above 50% dominance again.
June 14 2019: Bitcoin breaks above 60% dominance
June 28 2019: Bitcoin is at 63% dominance and is 68% of the top 20, and somewhere around 80% of the top five.
The top five (and ZuckBucks, when it kicks off) are the only ones that have ANY chance of displacing Bitcoin, and of those, one is an outright scam (BCash), one is a consortium of banks (Ripple), one is centrally controlled by someone who can't stop tinkering with it and reversing transactions whenever something breaks (Ethereum), and the smallest one is just a fork that uses a different hashing algorithm (Litecoin).  ZuckBucks has the marketing power of Facebook and a few dozen major companies, but it's centralized and Facebook has a terrible history when it comes to fucking its users.  As Mark Zuckerberg himself once said, "They trust me (dumb fucks)."
@_date: 2019-06-07 10:31:09


Why not?  It's basically a centralized solution, no different from what banks do, or more narrowly what Visa/MC do -- and they process far more transactions than Bitcoin.
By limiting and controlling who can process transactions, they don't need to worry about cryptographically secure trustlessness.  They just need to prevent anyone from hacking into their little banking network.
tl;dr: it's basically Visa/MasterCard.

Gold didn't even break US$1000 per ounce in 1980, and inflation by today is at worst about 2.5:1 -- definitely over 2:1 (1986-2009) but not a huge amount more than that.

Is it your video?  [This one, I mean]( that you [linked to here]( The audio quality is poor (heavily saturated) and there is very little information other than the existence of the system and the fact that the wallet can be added to.
Are there transaction fees?  If the card is lost, can it be replaced?  Is there any security beyond mere possession of the card?  If the card is stolen, can someone use up the entire balance?  Can the card be disabled if the authorized owner calls in the theft?
Do you have to have a cellphone to use the system?  How is this better than running a mobile Bitcoin wallet on your phone?
If you want to be used as a middleman and to extract fees from people, you need to provide some sort of useful service.  For credit cards, those services include acting as an intermediary, absorbing losses from thefts, and forcing merchants to refund money either voluntarily or involuntarily (chargebacks).
If all you're doing is acting as a Bitcoin wallet for people who can't figure out how to use Bitcoin. well, that's not really much of a value-added.  Getting stores to accept Bitcoin transactions via your system is nice, I suppose, and is a value-add, although I would prefer to see them natively accept Bitcoin.  Still, as an intermediate step perhaps it will help long-term acceptance.
@_date: 2019-12-05 07:44:04
That sounds good.
We have an exchange locally that partnered with convenience stores to allow people to buy Bitcoin in 3300-ish locations.  Unfortunately, after a few months of reasonable fees, they jacked up their fee structure so that it was 5% (just to buy -- and they also, separately, charge another 5% to sell, so 10% spread on their exchange), and they never bothered to make it available as a payment system to buy things at the stores -- it was only useful for people who wanted to buy more Bitcoin.

All the traders who thought they were being clever by only trading between crypto pairs and thus "never needing to report any gains because it's all crypto!" are going to go down in flames.
There's no like-kind exchange for crypto.  If you exchange BTC for USDT, that's a taxable event if you made a gain.  If you jump back into the markets and get ETH, that's taxable if you made a gain too (USDT does fluctuate a little, after all).  If you jump from ETH into some stupid shitcoin, that's taxable if you made a gain on ETH.
If you got a loss at any stage, you can offset gains, or roll it over in case you want to offset a gain the next year (or more years after that).
You cannot just say, "well, I exchanged one crypto for another, so it's all crypto, so I don't have to pay taxes on it until I exchange for fiat."  The U.S. tax system doesn't allow that.

I don't understand why people like LTC.  It was literally just Bitcoin with a different hash algorithm (although it may have diverged a bit more now).
I probably would have bought some five years ago if it had been available here (the local exchange only dealt with BTC until BCash came out, then for some reason they supported that scam) but at this point it's clear Bitcoin has beaten Litecoin out and that Litecoin is just coasting on fumes.
The outright scam of "Facebook is adopting Litecoin, Charlie Lee had to divest his coin holdings to comply with Facebook's conflict-of-interest requirements!" that happened around the peak also puts me off from it, especially after Charlie used Twitter to "challenge" Satoshi Nakamoto to "divest" himself of his own BTC holdings.

You're not entirely wrong, but is effectively just buying Bitcoin from these individual pizza-lovers and then hodling it.  Since the transactions are being done at fair market value, there is no immediate gain to be reported.
He needs to keep a record of how much cash he paid for each transaction, and to keep that record UNTIL HE SELLS.  At the time that he sells Bitcoin, that will be his "basis cost", and any difference between the basis and the sale price just has to be reported.  Do the sale in a single transaction and you'll only have to report a single line item -- "buy date: various, sell date: today, sale price: $1,048,576, basis cost: $3,153".  Wa-la.
It would be a good idea to change addresses (or Lightning Network channels) periodically, at least at the end of every tax year, so that it's easy to establish long-term gains vs. short-term gains.  Depends on how long he plans to hodl of course, if he's doing short-term trading then doing the math on taxes can get scary.

Both the buyer and the seller may be responsible for paying taxes.
If the amount of Bitcoin that the buyer sent to the friend was worth more than $100 at the time that the buyer sent it, then the buyer owes capital gains taxes on that gain.
If the friend sells it for more than the $100 basis cost OR the value at the time it was transferred, whichever is higher, then the friend owes capital gains on that gain.

Be warned that if the link he gave you is to a website that calculates it for you, rather than for software that you can download and run on an isolated machine that never, ever, connects to the internet ever again after you run the software,  it is probably a scam or will be hijacked shortly to make it a scam -- type seed words into the website, lose everything in your wallet immediately.

I doubt it.  LTC made a name for itself by moving faster than BTC on development.  But that was almost entirely because of Jihan Wu, Bitmain, and their giant ASICboost exploit scam, where they stalled progress for two years so they could fuck everyone else over.
Now, Litecoin development is basically dead (see the transcript from Charlie Lee's conference with the Litecoin Foundation) and there's no point in using it instead of Bitcoin, unless of course you already have some you want to get rid of.

(2) Call Coinbase and ask them to help you unfuck the situation, and/or
(3) Call Binance and ask them to help you unfuck the situation.
Most likely, if you transferred the USDT out of Coinbase, you probably had an account set up with Binance and Binance told you where to transfer the USDT so that it would show up there.  If you didn't transfer the USDT out of Coinbase, then it should still be sitting at Coinbase, and you should contact them instead.
There are a few other possibilities, like the guy conned you and had you send the USDT to him, or you screwed up and sent the USDT to some random address that isn't really accessible.  Talking to the above three parties may help you figure out what happened.

Without us knowing what, exactly, is wrong, and being dental experts enough to understand what "fix[ing] it" involves -- and what "fix it" means to you -- there's no way anyone is going to be able to tell you if $7200 is going to be enough.
There's also no way anyone can tell you if "a week or two" is going to be enough, because some procedures require a minimum of six weeks in between stages in order for, e.g., bones to heal -- two months minimum if you're a smoker.  If there is significant bone loss you may need grafts before they can put in posts for implants (if that's what you want/need) and that can take one to two *years* -- and it's not going to cost just $7200.
Just go to someplace with a good medical tourism reputation and relatively low costs, get evaluated, and sell enough Bitcoin to cover the costs.
I skipped seeing dentists for about five years, went in, got a cleaning, and walked out.  No cavities, no problems.  I still don't know why one tooth sometimes hurts and feels warm, but she didn't find any specific problem with it.  Five years and the only thing she commented on was "you have some tartar buildup on the inside lower front tooth surfaces, that's perfectly normal and everyone gets it."
It doesn't sound like you're in that situation, though.
Also note that the main reason I avoid dentists is because my childhood dentist filled in a lot of nonexistent cavities so that he could buy a boat and make payments on his Mercedes.  Fucking scumbag.  Roughly half of the dentists I've seen since then have similarly attempted to scam me -- then I go to a different one the next time and the new one says "what cavity? you don't have any cavities."  This is why I quit bothering for a long, long time;  I don't need the attempts to damage my teeth even more just so that they can pay off their student loans.
Dentists like to scare people with terrifying stories about patients who were so far gone that they needed to peel back their gums to scrub their teeth because of years of poor hygiene -- yeah, maybe that happens if you personally don't ever brush your teeth, have shitty genetics, smoke a lot of meth, and get into bar fights, but it's not the norm.  Fluoridation, Mandrake.  Do you realize that fluoridation is the most monstrously conceived and dangerous communist plot we have ever had to face?  It's incredibly obvious, isn't it?

Umm, I've got bad news for ya homie, if you're in the United States (other countries probably have similar systems too), depending on the state, that can result in what is called "adverse possession", where after a certain amount of time, she becomes the owner of that section of land.  You have as little as seven years in some states (others can be as long as forty years) for that to cause your land to become hers.
I think the worst thing I've heard was some legal-assistance talk radio show where an asshole called in and said his neighbor had just died, the kids didn't know where the boundaries were, and he was going to put up a fence well onto their property to pull this and wanted to know what he had to do to be sure of stealing their property.

Something to think about -- if you're not the sole owner of the entire business, you should get a legal agreement in writing about this from the owner(s)/partner(s)/investor(s).  Otherwise, when Bitcoin moons and you buy a Lambo, they may sue over the lost profits to them.
It doesn't matter that everyone is nice about it today and is just indulging you in your hobby.  If it becomes serious money, people can and often do turn into raging bitches.  "He stole that Bitcoin from the business!  He's hogging all of the profits for himself!"

Who knows.  Ethereum has a chance, unlike 99.9% of the "alts".  That said, its supply isn't capped and its supreme leader has too much control over its direction.
The core question isn't whether either will survive, it's which one will grow faster.  That will depend on adoption in real world commerce.  Ethereum's ICO craze has been regulated and scammed out of existence, but Bitcoin is being killed by all the people who just want to squat on it and do nothing.  Still, Bitcoin has far wider recognition and acceptance than Ethereum.

One of the operators has posted here in the past.  There are costs with running the machines, including rental fees for placing them and purchasing costs of the hardware (which is significant) and the difficulty of being forcibly thrown out of the banking system for daring to deal in Bitcoin.  Not even to mention that when the price is moving up, all the people who've been stalling on buying any suddenly dogpile on, he has to buy more, and then the price tanks and leaves him stuck with a huge baked-in loss (which is why price hedging with futures trading is a thing in any sort of commodity market, right down to corn and soybeans).
He wasn't making huge profits.

The equipment was getting confiscated so that the people who confiscated it (mostly the local police) could use it to do their own personal mining.  Sort of like the cops who confiscate five pounds of weed and put three pounds into evidence.
Even if Venezuela, as a country or as its central bank, were to set up Bitcoin mining, the mined coins would simply be stolen by Maduro, Ruzza, Chavez's daughter, and any or all of the other corrupt scumbags who have destroyed the economy.

Well, if you want to get hypertechnical about it, there is no such thing as a "software patent" in the U.S., either.  There are method patents that are implemented on computers.
The furor over "software patents" is frankly stupid.  It's driven by leftist fuckwits who don't understand the patent system and by major business interests who are trying to prevent small inventors from being able to protect their work.
Microsoft and AT&amp;T were two of the biggest anti-software-patent lobbyist supporters around back in the 1990s.  That was at least in part because Microsoft got caught red-handed stealing other companies' technologies, even integrating some of the other companies' source code into Windows, and didn't like it when they got sued and were forced to pay damages.
They'd much rather play "embrace, extend, extinguish" like they tried to do with Kerberos -- sure we'll join up with your open-source alliance!

Tesla is going to be an epic collapse, rivaled only by Enron.  Musk's whole business model was to ride the government subsidies for ZEVs.  Trump eliminating those subsidies on the federal level blew a gaping hole in Tesla's revenue stream.
On top of that, Musk is dividing his attention between thoroughly fucked Tesla and genuinely useful SpaceX.  Musk's unhinged behavior (everything from calling some random expat "pedo guy" to fucking with the SEC over his buyout fraud and violating his agreements with them, not to mention risking his security clearance with that pot-smoking stunt on the Joe Rogan show) shows that there is something seriously wrong with him -- maybe just stress-induced, or maybe the rumors about his drug use are true.

There are several ways to do it.  Pamela Morgan wrote a book, "Cryptoasset Inheritance Planning", for a general outline on what to do.  Note that your state or country laws may have some requirements about how you have to do it, so check with a lawyer in your jurisdiction if you have significant assets (not just crypto) that you want to pass on to specific people, instead of relying on the courts to do a default process.
Also, don't use Shamir's Secret Sharing (SSS).  There was a pretty good Medium article a few months ago that explained why time-locked transactions and multisig are far superior.
The most basic way mentioned in the Medium article was for a crypto holder to use a multisig 1-of-2 with one address timelocked for a fixed period and the other address kept by the hodler.  Give the timelocked address to whomever you want to inherit your assets.  If you croak, they can get the coins after that time interval has expired.  If you don't croak, then you can use the coins, and before the interval expires you just move them to another 1-of-2 multisig and give the new timelocked keys to your heirs.
With SSS, there are constant security issues and issues with having to update the partial secrets.

Mining wasn't big business in the past.  Nowadays the block reward has to be compared to the price of electricity and hardware depreciation.
With the block reward getting cut in half in one swell foop some time in May 2020, a lot of miners will suddenly find themselves unable to afford to run.  This will centralize mining in areas with cheap (or free/offgrid/stolen) electricity.  For miners who have to pay market prices, such as all the "should I buy an Antminer to heat my house this winter?" types, they're either going to have to shut down or, in effect, subsidize mining in the hope that the price will rise enough to make it worthwhile some day.

A few years ago there was at least one company that claimed to be setting up Bitcoin IRAs.  I haven't seen them mentioned in a while now and don't know if they were able to deal with the regulations (or lack thereof and constantly changing "guidance).
Do remember that you have to pay taxes on that Bitcoin, and so do your employees.  If you listen to the "it only happens when we convert to fiat!" crowd, you WILL get audited and end up sorry and sore.  Your company will have to pay on the corporate earnings, and it'll be treated as income to your employees unless you can do a real 401(k) plan.

It actually is.  People saw that the two years of FUD and threats that had been holding Bitcoin back had finally been resolved.  A second (and a third, and a fourth) major attack was also deflected.  That was a hell of a lot of uncertainty to obliterate in just a few short weeks.
Then, after those who were actually aware of the situation got done with their buying and brought the price up from around $1K to $4K, the price had shot up so much from that that the news media started talking about it, and all the "OMG I just heard of this let's all buy some!" people dogpiled in, and the price went parabolic from $4K to $20K in just four months.

There's no way in hell it could have.  The total market cap of Bitcoin right now (at a price of $5,100-ish) is only around 90 billion (source: coinmarketcap.com, I just loaded the page while typing this), and I'm pretty sure that value is counting all of the "lost" and "burned" coins as if they were available.
To buy that much in 2010, a buyer would have had to get 95%-ish of the future miners through today to commit to selling to him at $0.003.
- - -
Edit almost a day later: I didn't read the fine print;  the table calculates the "how much you would have made" number using a value of $16,837 from December 14 2017.  That's roughly triple the price right now ($5239).  Their number assumes you purchased roughly 5107654 BTC.  This is about 29% of all the BTC available today, which is still multiple times the number of BTC that had already been mined in May 2010.
IOW, still impossible, but not quite as impossible.

If this is income (which is broadly defined as "any money that shows up in your life from anything other than an outright gift from someone else who has already paid taxes on it"), then you have to pay taxes on the entire $4000 -- or actually whatever the value of the BTC is at the time that it shows up in your life.  You ALSO have to pay taxes on any capital gain (or deduct any capital loss) that you make from the time that it shows up in your life to the time at which you sell.
Example: you execute a trade and magically make 0.066093 BTC.  The value of that is $500.  You pay taxes on that $500.  You then sell .0330465 BTC and because of price fluctuations you get $255.  You have to pay tax on the additional $5 in capital gains you just made.  Then you sell the other half and you only get $235 for it.  You can (but don't absolutely have to) declare a $15 capital loss and write it off against your gains and your income.  The IRS would love you if you didn't write off your losses, but that would be stupid and they'd also probably think it was suspicious as hell and audit you to figure out what you're hiding, so you may as well do it.

The business would base its taxes owed on the dollar price of their sandwiches, same as if they sold for fiat.  They're going to owe exactly the same amount in taxes if they sold three sandwiches for $15 in USD as they would for selling three sandwiches for $15 in BTC.
If the business sees Bitcoin as a long-term hold and doesn't cash out to pay their bills, then they don't incur any more taxes until they cash out their BTC.  When they do, they have to figure out if they made a capital gain or loss, and whether it is a long-term or short-term capital gain/loss, and pay taxes on that accordingly.
If the business cashes out every day, then they would probably get eaten alive on fees, but would endure minimal volatility.  They could probably treat the Bitcoin as a simple payment in that case, also, but talk to a tax accountant to be sure.

The current military dictatorship rewrote the so-called "constitution" to give itself control, and just held a sham election that they aren't giving the results for because they're trying to use the dictatorship-controlled courts to disqualify some opposition candidates after they couldn't commit enough vote fraud to get as good a showing as they wanted.

It would be nice if you're right (from my perspective anyway, because I'd be insanely rich), but IMHO even if the scaling effect is true up through midsized networks, it simply cannot hold true once saturation begins to be reached.  The marginal value of adding some remote Amazon tribe ten years from now is not as great as the value of getting a few ice cream shops to join in right now.
Taking email as the example (which Metcalfe's Law was originally about -- well, telecommunications anyway), it makes little difference to the value of the overall network at this point whether the Sentinelese gets connected, whereas it made a great deal of difference when ARPAnet started adding even a few small commercial companies back in the 1970s.

People will be moving money into U.S. Treasuries, gold, and stocks like ADM and Cargill (people gotta eat even in a recession).  Bitcoin may get some benefit, but it's more likely that hedge funds will have to sell their Bitcoin to cover their other losses, just like happened with gold during major plunges in 2008 -- the stock market would drop, then three days later gold would drop so they could pay their margin calls, then gold would climb back up again.  Eventually, once things shook out, gold went way up because it was seen as a safe haven from the chaos, but even then, it eventually dropped back by 30% as the Fed started "printing" money and handing it out to banks to buy stocks.

Nah, September 11th kicked it into high gear, but the government has been destroying constitutional protections for decades before that.  Prohibition (banning alcohol) in 1919 gave the government a taste for trampling people's rights.  FDR was all about putting jackboots on people's necks, whether through banning ownership of gold money or prohibiting people from growing their own food (see *Wickard v. Filburn*).  The 1970s stepped it up with an expanded drug war.  Gun rights, search-and-seizure, right not to self-incriminate, all of these have been shredded, and long before September 11th.

Usually you have to be an "accredited investor" to put money into these groups, meaning you need at least a million USD in capital, and they require a significant chunk of cash, usually $100K minimum.
Also, they typically take 2% of the assets off the top annually as a fee, and 20% of any gains.
Looking at their site, they say they are an "alpha fund" that tries to BEAT Bitcoin's performance.  By putting money into Bitcoin, and hodling all they would be able to do is match it, so they are either actively trading, trading in shitcoins, or buying into infrastructure businesses.

Not everyone is intelligent or technically capable enough to manage the security necessary to store bitcoin safely.
Your paper wallet can be stolen by a thief or can burn in a house fire.
Leaving a public-private key pair on your computer means that it can be stolen by a virus or a hacker, or by a burglar who steals your computer, or by any random person you allow to use your computer.
There are thousands of scam sites out there that helpfully tell people how to get set up, incorrectly, so that their BTC can be stolen.
There are dozens of major exchanges that intentionally confuse people about BCash vs. Bitcoin in order to dump BCash on them.

From a legal perspective, the US government could ruin your life if you fail to account for your income.  It's up to you whether the inconvenience of doing a spreadsheet to account for all that mess is worth not having to worry about that risk.
Note that you may be able to offset the 2017 gain with your 2018 loss.  I didn't know that that was possible until a CPA told me you can bring losses both forward (up to 20 years) or backward (up to 3 years).  So, if you bother to do that work, you may get more money refunded.

Security suggestion: make it so that it requires a password to open an encrypted file container where its keys are stored.  The password can be supplied via a keyboard plugged into a USB plug, and the keyboard then can be removed.  Also, power should be supplied via an external supply (over the Pi's USB power connection), not via an internal battery pack.
This way, if someone grabs the machine and runs, the power will be disconnected, the keys will be safely locked away, and you won't lose your Bitcorn.
TrueCrypt 7.1a has a build that works on the Pi.  For some reason the hidden container code doesn't work, but a single partition works.  It's still available on GRC.com

I disagree, the giant bubble was when most of the shitcoins briefly took off, destroying Bitcoin's percentage dominance of the overall market.  I remember quite clearly thinking "things are heating up, I really should buy some ETH, it's only $15" and then just a few months later it was $1000.
I didn't buy any;  looking into it, I decided ETH's central control was not a model I liked.  On the one hand, I lost an opportunity to make an even bigger killing than I have with BTC, on the other hand I still think not buying into Vitalik's "hard fork whenever something fucks up again, gee maybe I should change the entire underlying algorithm" coin was the right decision in the long run.
If ETH had fallen only as much as BTC has, Bitcoin would still have less than a 50% share of the overall market.

"Bitcoin Cash" was a scam set up by a Chinese mining rig company founder after the rest of the world discovered he'd coded an exploit into his mining rigs' firmware so that he could mine faster than everyone else.  He had been preventing further development of new features through a massive FUD campaign because the most important of the new features would have stopped his exploit from working.
So, when he lost, he forked off BCash from real Bitcoin and tried to subvert the existing Bitcoin system through spam attacks.  He was hoping that between the name confusion, advertising, attacks on the existing network, and partnering with some of the major exchanges, that he could make his system the dominant one (he called it "The Flippening").
He failed, and now BCash is a confusing pimple on the ass of the real system.

Your premise seems to be inherently flawed from the outset.
There is no "subculture" or "distinctive culture".  Bitcoin users are anyone who wants to buy something make payments, sell sell something, receive payments, store money somewhere safe (for a given value of "safe"), transmit money to someone else, speculate on the possibility of a price rise, or a combination of these things (and possibly others).
To the extent that that is a "subculture", so is the "subculture" of credit card users/processors/issuers/bankers.  In other words, pretty much everyone except Sentinelese and Afghani back-country farmers.

In a crash, all assets go down in price.  People get forced to sell off just about anything in order to pay expenses, cover margin calls, and pay off losses on other investments.
This was highly visible in 2009.  The market would plunge, and three days later gold would drop as hedge funds were forced to liquidate their gold holdings to pay margin calls.  This was despite gold being the only real safe haven asset, that everyone was flooding to.  Overall it went up, but much of the gain was after the market crash was over.

You could get lucky.  But look at the "bitcoin dominance" stats.  At one point, of course, Bitcoin was 100% of cryptocurrency.  Then along came Litecoin and Ethereum and the percentage of crypto that was Bitcoin plunged down.  Then came all the shitcoins and ICO scams and suddenly Bitcoin was looking like it might not exist much longer because "OMG it's so old, one of the others will take over just like Facebook wiped the floor with Myspace!"
Some time around last August IIRC, Bitcoin became 50% of the market again.  And up until about two weeks ago, it was struggling between 50% and 51.7%.
In just the last few days it went up to over 52%.  Right now it's 53.2%.  It's only going to go higher;  all the shitcoins and scamcoins are finally dying, and the other real attempts at cryptocurrencies just aren't keeping up.
Ethereum is about as immutable as a wet noodle;  every time a major disaster takes place on it, Vitalik does another hard fork to get out of it.  Litecoin is just an also-ran that basically acts as a testnet, and even its founder dumped all of his ownership of it after pumping it with rumors of some huge deal and claiming he was told he had to get out as a condition of the deal.  Ripple is controlled by the banks that run it.  BCash was a scam from the outset.
I have no idea what "Binance Coin", "EOS", "Cardano", or "Stellar Lumens" are about.
Rounding out the top ten by market cap (per coinmarketcap.com) is Tether, which is a stablecoin pegged at $1 per unit, and there have been constant rumors ever since it came out that it was all a scam with no funds backing it, although it seems to have done just fine even if it was.
Below that, Monero and Dash supposedly have privacy features.  I dunno.  Maybe they'll be useful to the darknet crowd.  After those, there are all the "we're going to replace Bitcoin *any day now!!!*" shitcoins, the only one of which I've ever even heard of is Tezos, and it's less than 1% the market cap of Bitcoin, although at least it's jumped sharply in the last few weeks.

The Tether FUD has been going on for well over two years now.  The documents already revealed in the NYAG lawsuit proved that the FUDsters were lying.  The only reason Tether BECAME partially unbacked was because several governments confiscated their assets from a South American bank in the name of "that bank is doing business with drug dealers!"
You can also look at it another way.  Two and a half months ago, the market cap of the overall market was roughly the same as today.  Tether had $3.4 billion outstanding units.  Today Tether has a little over $4 billion outstanding units, for a net change of $600,000,000.
Bitcoin's market cap has increased by 22% since then, or $35,000,000,000.  Roughly 58X the amount of Tether that's been "printed".
Since Tether has made it known as part of the lawsuit disclosures that they are holding part of their backing money in Bitcoin (to avoid more confiscations), it's likely that they have already more than made up the amount confiscated by Poland, Portugal, Colombia, and the United States.
The reality is that Tether is being used extensively for cross-border gray market trade.  Physical trade, as in Chinese merchants selling clothing and electronics in Russia ([$10,000,000 to $30,000,000 per day just for that](  All of the "OMG Tether is unbacked and it's all a scam to bid up Bitcoin!" is just shitcoin shills repeating bullshit that they've heard -- and the whole fraudulent accusation was most likely engineered by the U.S. in an attempt to stop Tether and other stablecoins from becoming used in commerce.  Gotta protect the dollar's role in international trade ya know!
The reality is, if Tether were being used to pump-and-dump coins, they'd have a much better shot at picking some random tiny shitcoin, jacking its price to the stratosphere, and then dumping it on the FOMO bagholders.
@_date: 2019-09-14 08:15:44
No, it really isn't.  You don't have to convert it in order to report the amount paid.  You just have to say, "we registered a domain name, our standard fee is $6.99, they paid us in Bitcoin at a rate that we both agreed equalled $6.99, therefore that was how much we got."
If someone sends a ridiculous overpayment, then they can refund it.  For trivial differences, it might not be worth the transaction fee for an on-chain, in which case too bad for the person who sent the wrong amount;  maybe they can use LN for refunds.
If/when they convert the Bitcoin into fiat, or trade it, or whatever, then they report any capital gains or losses at that later time.

You know how much in fiat terms you invoiced the client for.
The client is not an idiot and is not going to send you a significantly different amount of BTC.  If they do, you either refund the difference (if over) or insist that they pay you the right amount (if they tried to shortchange you) -- or of course you could write off the difference in the name of client relations.
Then you pay taxes on the invoiced amount, or on the lesser amount if you got screwed and decided to eat the shortchanging.

If you were an American citizen or U.S. resident at the time you sold, you're fucked.
People don't seem to get that EVERY value-gained transaction is taxable.  There is and always has been a catch-all provision for barter exchanges in the Internal Revenue Code, and you're required to report and pay taxes under that section if you believe you have made a gain on any trade.  If you traded a piece of used chewing gum for a flattened piece of roadkill possum, the IRS wants its cut of whatever value you gained.
They don't go after gum-for-roadkill trades because there's no realistic value being gained therein.  They DO go after people making money off tips, drug sales, and under-the-table off-the-record business deals.  They absolutely WILL go after you for "cashed out five million dollars in Bitcoin" trades.  Eventually they'll notice your sudden bank balance in the system and freeze your accounts.
If you contact an accountant RIGHT NOW and ask for help on clearing this up, you MIGHT get away with the 20% capital gains tax rate plus about another 10% in penalties and interest for two years of failure to report.
If you were neither an American citizen nor were a U.S. resident at the time you sold, your own government's tax laws may mean you're fine.

Because LN isn't on-chain, there is no "attack vector".  LN is off-chain until a channel closes.  Someone can spam hundreds of LN transactions, then try to close their channel, and ONE transaction gets shipped off to the on-chain network with a 1MB block size limitation.  And that one single transaction may take up a bunch of space, but they'll have to pay enough of a fee to get a miner to accept it.
One risk I've wondered about is, what if a channel-closing transaction would require more than a full block of data?  I lightheartedly assume that the LN devs have taken this into account.

Law review note?
How about tax treatment of forks for hodlers?  IRS hasn't issued guidance, and they could royally fuck everyone if they say "it's a dividend, taxes are due immediately", because lots of people don't even know what a fork is, much less how to collect it (without being ripped off through a replay transaction) and pay taxes on it.  Not even to mention that the prices on forks are usually artificially inflated at first because the fraudsters who create them swap the coins amongst themselves at ridonkulous valuations that no one else on the planet would really pay.
Or does the IRS just treat them as a part of the original purchase, to be taxed at the time of the sale if someone ever finds out about them and cashes out?
A while back, someone posted a list of all the forks of Bitcoin, and there were either 26 or 40+ at that time, I forget which.
I came up with a gedankenexperiment related to it, where as a demo in court arguing against such treatment, I'd run a program to create new forks every five minutes and start trading them at inflated values on a brand-new exchange site.
Not sure how to tie economics into it, unless tax treatment counts as such, or fraudulent valuations count as such.

Depends on the jurisdiction.  In the U.S., if you know someone is going to use what you sell them for illegal activities, you can be prosecuted for selling it to them.
See for example all the people who sold hydroponics supplies to marijuana growers.  I personally know one who spent two years in federal prison and five years on probation for that.
Similarly, two ATF informants tried to entrap me at a gun show one time by starting to buy a handgun from me, then the one who was purchasing ti offhandedly mentioned that he couldn't wait to take it home to California.  Sorry buddy, private sales to out-of-state individuals are illegal under federal law.  Which, of course, you know, because you're ATF informants. . . .

No, like-kind exchanges have to be called out specifically in the tax code.  They do not exist unless there is a rule stating that a particular type of transaction counts as a like-kind exchange.
No such rule has ever existed for cryptos, so there is not and never has been a way to count trades as like-kind exchanges.

But because the Castro brothers begged Krushchev to nuke NYC, the Kennedy administration said "no mas!" and blocked them from dealing with the U.S., so poor little Cuba can't survive in this world.

I think maybe you don't understand what stock prices are.  They aren't a big pile of cash that can be moved from one place to another.  They are a big balloon full of air that can pop and leave only a thin largely useless rind behind.
Once upon a time, I had bought some sort of LASIK center stock on the recommendation of a newsletter.  A few months later, there was a news article about the company losing a patent lawsuit in Europe.  The next morning at the opening bell, the stock had plunged 40%.
There was no big pile of money representing that 40% that moved from one person to another.  Rather, the company's future earnings predictions simply evaporated, along with 40% of the stock price.
Enron was another example.
The "book value" of a company is supposed to represent hard assets.  Some companies, like Yahoo!, sell for less than book value, because their executives, e.g., Marissa Mayer, are so good at destroying the business and wasting everyone's money and time.  Other companies, like Beyond Meat, sell for ridiculously huge amounts above book value, because we're in a gigantic bubble and people are stupid.
Anyway, that money won't magically flow into Bitcoin.  That money never existed.  When it pops, people see a more correct reflection of the actual value rather than the puffed up price.

To add to what discussed, you also have to realize that the reason SegWit was being opposed was because Jihan Wu was using an exploit ("Covert ASICboost") to enrich himself and his company, and SegWit was going to destroy his ability to hide the exploit.  That's why there was a multi-year FUD campaign that stalled development, followed by a hard fork to create BCash so that he could continue his scam against the utter fools who believed his line of (literally) patent-pending bullshit.
Fortunately, someone disassembled the firmware on his mining rigs to prove the existence of Covert ASICboost as well as his attack vector for remotely shutting down his customers' mining rigs, which IIRC was named "Antbleed".  His plan was to destroy Bitcoin so that he and those he brought in on the scam could take over the entire ecosystem.

No one other than a complete idiot would deny that Bitcoin has problems.
No one other than a truly retarded concern troll would pretend that anyone other than complete idiots would deny that Bitcoin has problems.
Example: limit on number of transactions in initial implementation, a.k.a. "scalability"
Solutions: SegWit, Lightning Network, sidechains, and several more.
Example: traceability of transactions, aka "anonymity"
Solutions: BTMs, coin mixers, LN, face-to-face cash transactions
Example: when Bitcoin reaches US$100,000,000/BTC, the smallest unit will be worth $1
Solution: add more zeroes to the base protocol


Can you name any other legitimate benefit for any "we're better than Bitcoin and will replace it!" coin to exist?  Is that not what all the altcoins pretend?
* BCash has its big empty blocks to do something about the scalability problem
* Monero has built-in anonymity
* Tether is pegged to the world's reserve currency so ecommerce sites won't be terrified by the volatility
* Ethereum has a buggy Turing-complete language rammed up its asshole so that it can be hacked and lose everyone's coins
*  GNU Taler has some sort of tax collection mechanism built in because GNU is run by a bunch of statist communists who hated the idea of an uncontrollable cryptocurrency

Not sure what your point is.  In 1989, after graduating and losing internet access at my university, I had to do a fair bit of digging to find a public-access UNIX system that I could get an account on.  That allowed me to have an email address so I could keep in touch with a few college friends who also had access.  The web didn't exist at that point, of course.
The public-access UNIX system was just dial-up, not internet.  I could use a few limited internet services like FTP from that remote UNIX machine, but then I had to download them to my machine over a non-PPP/non-IP connection.  Which basically meant converting them to an ASCII text file using only [0-9a-zA-Z], downloading the text file, and unconverting them.  (Attempting to download an 8-bit binary file would fail because the terminal program would see characters like ctrl-S and freeze.)
After around 1996 I could use Lynx to view just a text version of web pages.  Yay for VT220 emulation.
I think I got an ADSL line in 1998.  My section of the city I lived in was the first to get this exciting new technology that had just started to get installed in a few places.  I had to argue with the phone company over it because a few years earlier, they'd installed a "splitter" on my phone line so that I could get a second (muxed) phone line for modem use, and they didn't want to remove it so that I could have ADSL, which was incompatible with any line that had a splitter.

Fortunately, in the United States, the law is generally that anything being done in public can be photographed or videoed without permission.  Audio recordings depend to some extent on the state, with some of the more corrupt states trying to block audio recordings in order to hide political and police corruption, but the federal courts sometimes shoot those cases down.

Even the majority of the top 20 are outright scams or hot garbage.
"Bitcoin SV" and BCash (aka "Bitcoin Cash") are both attempts to confuse newbies who think they have something to do with Bitcoin.  Ripple is just a bunch of banks trying to come up with their own centrally-managed pseudoblockchain.  IOTA's founders were laughing at people who wanted to cash out and were unable to find buyers for their shitcoin, telling them that they should just hold onto it forever;  last I heard, their super-special "it's a digraph!" software doesn't even work yet, and they still haven't come out with a coherent explanation of how that magically makes their product better anyway.
ETH is the only one that might end up continuing to be used in the real world, and it's run by an idiot.  ETC split from ETH when the central authority for the Ethereum project decided to do a hard fork to violate their fundamental "code is law" tenet, because their scripting language implementation was screwed up and let someone steal IIRC somewhere around sixty million dollars.  ETH is the "fuck our stated principles, we want a do-over" codebase, ETC is the "be honest and suffer the consequences" codebase.  And that was just the first of multiple hard forks, not to mention the future plan of "let's throw the whole thing out and convert from POW to POS!"
And so on and so on.  Go ahead, "invest" in a bunch of projects that hype themselves based on trivial and pointless technicalities.  Surely some of them won't turn out to be completely worthless, rite guise??!?!?!!
Meanwhile, basically anything that any other project implements, can also be implemented in Bitcoin.  That's why it's called software, right?  So, what's the point of the others?  Other than being testbeds, I mean?

Unless you're a true whale, with 1000+ BTC waiting to be cashed out, that's a pretty extreme thing to do.  Also, exit tax, not that the government would ever know you have that much BTC unless you talk about it -- but if you don't reveal that, it could make it impossible for you ever to go back for a visit.
I know someone who went through all of that renouncing citizenship and getting a new one years ago because "how dare the U.S. not have gay marriage". Well, now it does, and where he got his new citizenship still doesn't, and now he has a hard time getting a U.S. visa to visit family.  He whines about it constantly.

There's another issue -- he named himself as the inventor on a bunch of patent applications that he licensed to nChain.  Australian patent law has an interesting oddity, in that patents can be filed for long after the invention was made public if the inventor was unaware of the filing requirements.  The patents aren't any good against existing users of the technologies, but they are good (in Australia) against new entrants.
* if he claims to be the real Satoshi Nakamoto
* then he invented the technologies
* and he can still get Australian patents on them
* and nChain can demand licenses from new entrants to the Australian market
But if he wasn't Satoshi Nakamoto, then he wasn't the inventor, then all those late-filed patent applications are worthless, and nChain can go after him for fraud.
