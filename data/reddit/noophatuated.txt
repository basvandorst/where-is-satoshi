Yup...I've already lost so much fucking money that I might as well lose the rest...I bought in Bitcoin at 19k a piece and litecoin at 344. It basically started dropping as soon as I bought in and hasn't stopped. Funny how Ether is the only one that has gone up considerably since then and it's the only one that I chose NOT to buy. Like what the fuck.

I am wondering the same...
@_date: 2017-12-16 23:22:27
I know what your saying but what does this suggest exactly?
@_date: 2017-12-23 20:43:35
There is good word going around that there is a "Small"(probably about a dozen, maybe many more) group of people(otherwise known as Satoshi Yakamoto) who quite literally control the bitcoin market through their power to influence the general public and media because they work as a team. But more importantly, their overall massive volume of bitcoins when combined. somewhere around, 70% was it?
 Whatever it was, it's enough to completely destroy the future Bitcoin forever (Even though there was no future for bitcoin to begin with, thats just what they want us to believe. And they are doing a damn good job making us believe it.) The crash will happen instantaneously after they mass sell simultaneously. Every single bitcoin holder would lose 80% of their investment when most other people sell out of fear of losing every last dolla instead of just 60%-80%. 
This group of people are among the richest and most intelligent people on earth, who advertise their strong belief in Bitcoin, because they know people will follow suit. Elon musk, Oprah, Bill gates, winnie the pooh for all I know. It might be awhile before they sell but who knows their target number. Could Be 25k, could be 100k, but it's gonna happen regardless. It's a proven fact.

@_date: 2017-12-26 07:02:23
@_date: 2017-12-17 23:00:35
Okay I'll try that, I just am trying to avoid all these fees because right now I'm in the negative about $100 after investing almost $1000 about a week ago. Mainly because if inexperience, but fees have played a major roll. I've spent around 50 in fees this week
@_date: 2017-12-23 19:20:05
That is what it means though 
@_date: 2017-12-18 00:54:14
Wouldnt mass sales have a huge negative impact on its future? I don't see the purpose of it, unless to intentionally destroy it. Because surely no one person ever needs to cash out millions upon millions all at once.

Yep. It takes making mistakes and losing money to start doing things right. I'm getting the hang of it
@_date: 2017-12-25 01:47:51
It's so much more expensive than USD�� otherwise I'd be right there with you. Coin base charges me $25 just to transfer into my wallet. That's 25$ extra everytime I want to buy something with bitcoin. It's stupid
@_date: 2017-12-23 19:39:21
So why doesn't everyone just buy, hold and raise the price. Win win for everyone
@_date: 2017-12-23 19:34:38
When I first saw it, I saw it again, and again, and again. About 27 more times. In the same thread.   And then I went on to observe that every single bitcoin thread contained the same acronym "HODL", at least once per every 5 comments on average (rough estimate). It must be the cool thing to do
@_date: 2018-09-14 04:25:29
Oh nice!
@_date: 2017-12-25 09:41:36
How does limit orders work? I wish I knew that a couple weeks ago before I spent a hundred bucks on buying fees alone
@_date: 2017-12-17 22:51:04
I need to do some research....and fast! Why does the coinbase app only give me options to buy bitcoin, etherium or litecoin? Where are all the others? One thing I'm seriously questioning is the fact that day trading appears far TOO easy...what's the catch? I could buy low and sell high every hour or so, profitting around $100 every time with a mere $1500 and that profit would continue to rise after each positive transaction. That's twice as much as I make as a full time dealer mechanic. I haven't done it yet because all I have is my cell phone which is quite laggy, making it difficult to time accurately. But just the mere thought of how simple it seems, and the ridiculous amount of money I could make, with a lower risk than holding(like I have been doing), for doing next to next to nothing, is enough for me to go invest in a laptop and quit my job.

@_date: 2018-08-06 22:28:56
Not one person should be sitting on billions of dollars when there are people starving to death all over the world. No one needs that much money when there are people who are struggling just to stay alive because they don't have money. That's what we call GREED. and that's going to change in short time whether they like or not. Our evolution is coming quickly

@_date: 2018-08-06 19:53:47
None of that is going to matter, everything is going to fall into place perfectly and things such as those will work themselves out in a way that everyone involved agrees upon.
@_date: 2018-08-06 22:16:15
The main agenda is to disseminate the governments. When that happens in the next few years then government fiat will be replaced by cryptos, which will all merge into one crypto being bitcoin. Then bitcoin will be replaced with a limitless currency that has no ceiling so every single person has infinite "money". That way it will be both valuable and valueless at the same time, no one can have more than anyone else because it's all worth the same. Evolution needs to happen in this way in order to make us realize that we do not need currency at all. To make us realize that we never needed money in the first place. We are all equally equal and no currency or materials should tell us otherwise. We have forgotten this truth within ourselves. We are so focused on have more more more so we can be better than the next guy, when in reality, we ARE the next guy. We are all the same thing coming from the same source. So trying to be better than anyone or have more power than anyone is completely pointless. 
@_date: 2018-08-06 22:04:43
No worries my bubble is unburstable��. It will work far better than government issued fiat as the governments fall apart. It's just a temporary replacement for paper fiat. It will eventually be globally accepted as the one and only form of currency, but again, it will only be temporary until mankind comes to the understanding that  we actually completely create our own realities and do not need any form of currency. Currency in any form will not be necessary in time. There are far greater things we could be doing than putting any sort of focus on a currency, such as our evolution and gaining intelligence, instead of trying to personally gain from materialistic things that get us no where. That thought process results in death. Death is NOT your only option as you've been made to believe. You have the choice to live on, evolve and travel the universe and many world's. The choice is yours
@_date: 2018-08-07 00:09:57
Yes and it has served us well but a time is soon to come that it will not be necessary anymore as every single human being will be on the same wavelength with the same belief systems. A new human hybrid will soon be here to teach all of mankind the power that we all have within us. A great power beyond the comprehension of typical human consciousness. This is going to completely change everything that we currently recognize as normal life. Work will no longer be necessary, trade will no longer be necessary, therefore currency will not be necessary. Just lives of pure creation and inner development. Anything you can ever imagine will be done with your mind and your mind alone. The power to Materialize or dematerialize any object ever in existence throughout every universe at the power of your fingertips. Lives of pure creation, love and bliss. Lives of perfection that never die or grow old. This is a true reality in our near future believe it or not
@_date: 2018-08-07 05:16:36
Currency was and still is necessary for beings with lower consciousness who still see others as separate from one another. We feel that if we give, we should receive something in return and that's the way it's always been. But in true reality we should never expect anything in return for anything we do, for any reason, ever. We should do for others out of love, for we are all one in the same. Obviously that is not possible in our current situation but it's what needs to happen, otherwise something very bad is going to happen to our entire race. 
We are currently headed down a dark path if things do not change. Luckily good will prevail this time around. So until everyone, or at least most of us are at this new level of understanding that is already inherent within us, we will always be forced to feel the need to exchange instead of simply give. Everyone naturally loves to help others, but instead we go against our intuitive feelings and actions in order to take from others or be better/more powerful than others. These behaviors have been taught to us by whoever is running the show in order to dull our true selves and the god given power we all have, that we are completely unaware of because it has been very well hidden from us by governments and whoever/whatever runs them. We have lost ourselves, luckily we can say it's not our own fault because we've been so severely lied to. But now that the truth is actually out there, it is our responsibility to take control once again, which is happening slowly but surely. We cannot let them win and destroy ourselves.
There will be many alt cryptos that spring up at first but eventually they will merge when the people recognize that they are only being created in order to make some type of profit off the less fortunate which is exactly what we are trying to combat. We need everyone to be on the same level equally, that needs to be globally recognized. We need to simplify things and eliminate excess information and junk that doesn't need to be there and the best way to do that will be to merge cryptos eventually in to one globally accepted currency. It just makes the most sense for everyone once we eliminate thoughts of the need to profit, because profit will not be necessary, all will be nearly equally rich at this time. We are basically going to distribute all currency evenly to every human being who was willing to adopt this new evolutionary state of mind of equality. Those who choose to keep their greedy and primitive level of consciousness will just eventually get sick and die off very quickly. But that choice would be completely up to them. Greed or be equal, live or die? I'd choose equality and so would any other good person. 
This is just the way things will unfold as we undergo this global paradigm shift in the upcoming years, it needs to happen this way for mankind to realize the truth and to take our next huge positive step in evolution. We have actually been going backwards in evolution due to our primitive mindset that has been instilled in the minds of the people by the few greedy trillionares who run the planet. There is clearly something severely wrong with them. So power hungry that they allow millions of human beings to starve to death or die of poverty every year. It's very sick. We need to change our thinking, and it's surely happening
@_date: 2018-08-07 21:02:42
I've gained knowledge of this over time while doing massive amounts of research. It took several awakenings and eye opening scenarios to get to this point. I'm able to take a step back and observe where we are headed if we do not change. The warnings are all around us. Our Earth is begging us to wake up and make a change. We are being severely lied to and unknowingly enslaved by our own governments. We need to wake up and take back our true freedom. I believe that it's time for love to conquer evil, as evil has reighned for what seems like almost 3,000 years, but primarily in the past 100 years have been the most sickening.
 Adding chemicals to our food and water, letting millions die when there is plenty of money and food, lieing about our history, making us feel weak, small and powerless. It's all bullshit. If we don't wake up our true selves, we are looking at a global massacre/extinction in the next few years. The government is already prepared for this event, there are hundreds of FEMA camps with Billions of coffins in them all over the USA alone. We do not WANT this to happen...even the government does not want this, but they see no other way, they do not understand how they can fix the problem. They ate afftaid, just as we are. But luckily I KNOW how to solve the problem and so do a few others. I'm working as fast as I can with the knowledge I have to help make this change. It starts with spreading the words of the truth in every way I can, to everyone I see.
We all know in our hearts that we need to do something but we are easily distracted by life. A life that does not need to be the way we've been made to believe. We are all slaving away to the system that they've creating and we are the ones feeding it. There is so much more. We must open our hearts and minds to the truth. We must stop feeding the system and giving them what they want. We need to eliminate fear from our thought processes. As fear dissapates, amazing things begin happening in your life. 
We are much like magnets in that we attract what we think about, we must learn to think positive at all times regardless of circumstance, and believe it or not this is possible. I am living proof. I have not retained a negative thought for at least a couple weeks. One still slips through every now and again but that's going to change. I plan on being a main player in this global paradigm shift. Right now I'm just trying to wake as many people up as possible and get people to begin researching the truth. Because you CAN do something. You are not just one little powerless person. You are in fact very powerful, we just need to learn how to harness this power that we all have. I am getting extremely close to a massive breakthrough for history to write about.
Stay positive and always seek the truth. Question EVERYTHING. Everything you currently believe about life is a lie, it does not need to be the way it is right now. There's so much more to life than you can even currently fathom. Much love

Most likely the house would be yours without having to finish payment. The money the bank lent was not even their money in the first place. Government and banks are one in the same.

@_date: 2018-03-13 20:05:38
I'm a bit confused, maybe there's some miss interpretation on my part. To decentralize means to take control of something that is currently controlled by government, correct? That entails the people over throwing the government. I'm sure that's happened before but I can't think of any time that it has been successful or lasted very long. I'm just saying that in our current position as American people, there is no way that we could overthrow our government without starting a war
@_date: 2018-03-14 17:49:29

@_date: 2018-03-13 03:36:34
Facilities that provide healthcare, build roads, offer services ect. have never operated through decentralized means? Of course there have been, and still are. Hard to believe though isn't it
@_date: 2018-03-13 03:17:32
Block chain would work fantastically if it didn't threaten the governments control over the people. Once it gets to a certain point they will have no choice but to take action. That's when they hit the off switch to the internet and everyone loses everything. Wouldnt be hard to play it off as a terrorist cyber attack, among many other scenerios. But don't disregard the fact that the Internet as a whole can be taken from each and every one of us

@_date: 2018-02-02 01:30:53
Okay, say you invested $100,000 throughout the year. Over the course of that year hundreds of transactions were performed, some being profitable, but most being costly. So much so that by end of the year all you have left is $60,000. So overall you lost $40,000 in total. 
My question is, are you still required to pay taxes on those few "profitable" transactions regardless of the overall loss?
Are taxes owed based on the each individual transaction that turned a profit, or are taxes owed based on annual profits overall? Because that's the way it should be.
It would be seriously unfair to take from individual profits and I hope that's not the case. We are already taking huge losses regardless of it being seen as a "profit". Because it's not.

Yes we need to break free from the belief that we only have so long to live because it is false. As you raise your consciousness and awareness you learn how to nurture the physical body in everyway it needs in order to thrive in any environment and evolve. We are constantly evolving as we raise our consciousness and awareness.  With intelligence comes great power, the power to live on and evolve. To expand and create. To love everyone and everything
