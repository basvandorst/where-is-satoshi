Not sure if you are comfortable using a mobile wallet for the sweep and transfer.
If you are then Mycelium on android has good size and fee preview and you can adjust the fee yourself.

You have to swipe the private key first and only then when you initiate a new transfer will it know the size.

Transfer the btc to a new HD wallet. Use the old private key / HD wallet (which is now has 0 btc) to claim all forks.
Hardware wallets like Trezor have a utility to claim all forks safely.

Coinbase has the private keys for when the bitcoins are with them.
Once you transfer the bitcoins to your own wallet,  you own the private keys for that and are responsible for the security of it. 
A hack on Coinbase cannot compromise the bitcoins in your own private  wallet.

A Bitcoin address gives no access whatsoever to the bitcoins contained at that address. 
A private key needed for access to those Bitcoin. 
Even if Coinbase stores the public addresses you've sent your Bitcoin to, it doesn't give anybody access to your Bitcoin.

What happened to their orderbook around the time of the launch of the dark pool? 
@_date: 2015-12-12 22:15:23
Not quite there. 
Each Bitcoin address can contain as many bitcoins as you send to it. 
Eeach address has a private key associated with it and who owns / knows the private key has access to the address and the bitcoins it holds. 
You cannot change private key for an address or address for a private key. 
You can only transfer Bitcoin to a different address. 
You instruct Coinbase to transfer bitcoins to your personal address and since they have the private key they transfer the bitcoins they are holding for you to the address you told them to.

Two things that will make you sleep better:
1. Believe in the long term benefit of Bitcoin and commit to not selling anything during all of 2014. Then you don't have to care about price volatility and charts.
2. Put some low buy orders in so you don't feel you will miss out on any large corrections.

A google wallet holds traditional money, aka fiat. You trust Google that your money stays safe. Government can confiscate your money. 
A Bitcoin Wallet holds virtual / crypto currency. It is decentralised and based on cryptography. You are responsible for keeping it safe. 
Nobody can confiscate it, there are no charge backs. 
Transfers cost less than 5 us cents and are near instant. Be it $1 or $1,000,000,000 worth of value that you are transferring.

Have you seen the speed of decryption of bip38?
On my high end phone nexus5 it takes 30 seconds for one attempt. I've seen reports of 4-5 attempts / second on high end computer. 
Brute forcing relies on millions of attempts / second. The number of characters is more than enough, a wrench will be more efficient than brute forcing. 
About the pin, maybe it should be asked about during first usage? I only have around $50 in my mobile wallet so not too bad losing it. 
The phone is encrypted and protected by 8 number pin so I have that going for me.

I'm no expert but when the price is dropping dramatically I've seen lbc prices being well below market price to reflect the time it takes to settle a deal.
Difference in prices between sellers is sometimes due to some sellers not being as active as others and not realising there is a price "crash" and not adjusting accordingly.
If you want to take advantage of price crashes you'd be better of on an exchange and use trading tools.

Don't bother with the backup if you are not technically savvy. 
Next time, take a photo of the image that is presented when setting it up (the secret) and keep it safe, offline. 
If you are reading this and don't have a copy of your 2fa secret act now while you still have access. Turn 2fa off, turn it back on and copy the new secret.

I had the same concerns, you see many posts here over the year with same concerns. It (math) worked for us all. 
You can send a mbtc to and from it but that will lower the security of the cold storage.

Some of the benefits are that even if somebody records or steals your private key they cannot use it without the password. 
You can provide this to a 3 party cold storage provider or store with friends and family. 
Bip38 encryption is very resistant against brute force attacks which means even shorter (6-8) characters are safe. Should not be easily guessable however...

Download bitaddress.com source to an usb stick
Boot up a laptop from a cd, for example Tails Linux live cd
Don't connect to internet
Load up bitaddress.com from usb stick. All the code is client side so internet is not needed
Save generated paper wallets to usb or print directly (the love cd has printer drivers)
Never connect usb stick to an internet connected PC

For the paranoid:
Heartbleed bug could have caused an attacker to get hold of a server certificate, for example that of github where the source code for paper wallet generators lives. 
The hacker could then perform a man in the middle attack and serve you a compromised version of the paper wallet software. For example one that generates deterministic private keys. 
There would be no way to notice :-)

You can generate a secure private key using dice but to calculate the public key and Bitcoin address you really need a computer and some software. 
The below article points to a 100 line bash script which the smallest I've seen.

To check balance of your Bitcoin address and/or to spend bitcoin you have to be connected to Internet.

Focus on the high availability side. 
Build stateless components that can fail over in case of failure and spares that can be started in case of high load. 
Btc trading (unlike shares) is a 24/7 activity. Releasing new code has to be done without downtime. Every upgrade has to be backwards compatible. 
Cache on many levels: distributed in memory cache, static content cache, CDN, and many more. 
Build in thorough monitoring of both application performance and of customer activity. Create real-time dashboards for this.

Brian Armstrong mentioned Apple pay during the coinscrum in London yesterday. 
Apple pay is an innovation in the user interface. It sits there with square, paypal, Google wallet. 
Bitcoin is an innovation in the payment infrastructure and competes with visa, Western union and such. 
If Bitcoin gets big enough it can become one of the payment options of Apple pay. Apple pay can even automatically choose the most appropriate payment method giving a great user experience. 
Something apple is good at!

You can get screwed by change addresses depending on what client you use. 
Mycelium for example supports spending from cold wallet because it sends all change to the same address. 
The default Bitcoin client doesn't support cold wallet spending because it sends change to a new internal address (emptying the original cold wallwt). 
BTW, once your private key has been on the Internet, it's not cold storage anymore.

Download a bitcoin address generator to an USB stick. BitAddress is a popular choice:
Because all the code is Javascript and HTML that can be run in a browser from the USB stick you can use your brand new computer or boot from a live cd without touching the internet.
If you encrypt your paper wallet using the available BIP38 you can even expose the normally secret private key without anyone being able to steal your bitcoins.
BIP38 encryption is very resistant against brute force (it takes me 40 seconds to try a single password) so the password doesn't have to be too long / complex.
The private key can be used to deduce the public address but if it is encrypted only you can do this. I throw away the public key and distribute the encrypted private key to friends and family.
This gives me back-up in many places but nobody can snoop my balances.
Math - It just works™

This is a nice innovation albeit a bit expensive. 
What irks me is the fact you yourself have to specify what amount in fiat you want to cover. Since fiat value changes frequently (up AND down), you will have to fiddle with your cover frequently. 
Now they charge a percentage and take that from your BTC balance so there must be a conversion going on. 
The obvious question is why not just charge 2% in BTC from your BTC balance? 
One reason given is that the underwriters cannot insure btc directly because it has no upper bound. 
A better system would be for an insurer to have access to a large pool of BTC. Then the btc could be insured directly and replaced in case of theft/loss without any intermediary fiat conversion. 
Oh, and can't they beef up on security to lower their own insurance costs? That is what professional gold vaults do :-)

Broken Sha256 used for signing and broken encryption (ecdsa) are very different scenarios and he mentions fixes for both scenarios.
In case of broken signing this would affect mining and the community could decide on a new signing algorithm. Blockchain would remain safe.
To prevent risk from broken encryption he suggests to enhance the protocol to support arbitrary encryption which would then be specified for each transaction.

You look for previous resistance points, whole numbers, big buy orders around there and place you order just above. 
400 eur seemed like a bottom, there were big buy orders around 410.0000 so I set mine for 410.1111111 and it got triggered.

Trying to time the market to sell when hi and buy back when low is trading. 
It's very likely you will lose some or all your money trading without experience. 
Your best bet is to buy small amounts regularly. 
Your second best bet is to hold what you have and don't be tempted to sell or panick sell. 
Good luck!

You are spot on. 
Similar thing just happened to me. 
The item arrived in poor packaging and the box was damaged. Not usual amazon standard. 
I questioned the seller what's going on and he sent a screenshot of his purchase. 
It was 20% less than I had been charged in BTC! 
When I contacted support about it I was told that "Amazon will use a 3rd party seller if they are out of stock". I was told "it happens". 
So what I think is going on is "earners" are watching all wishlists and order items when the original amazon item is out of stock. 
**if they are lucky they get more btc then they spent in fiat** (and you end up with a counterfeit item from a 3rd party)

If the public key is known, there may be attacks in the future to compute the private key from the public key. 
The Bitcoin public/private key uses elliptic curve encryption. 
It's not possible with today's knowledge but potentially in the future there could be advancements (eg quantum computing) that would allow it. 
The Bitcoin address is double hash of the public key (sha256 and ripemd160) which means that 3 (very different) types of encryption algorithms are in use and this adds a lot more resiliency. 
If you expose the public key by spending you lower the security.... In theory...

Once you spend from an address, the public key becomes known in the transaction. 
Knowing the public key of an address makes it less secure than knowing just the address.

Nothing will happen with bitcoins from pre Hardfork. They are safe. 
You will effectively have same amount on both chains (woohoo, double money?). 
Value of either will fluctuate. You can choose to sell either ofg to be 100% in btc or btu. 
Or you can keep both to see which one remains (maybe both). 
If you start transferring post Hardfork things can get messy. 
If no protection is built into btu then a transaction on one chain can be replayed on the other. 
In this case a safe thing to do is to use some splitting mechanism that will prevent such replay. Likely nlock feature of btc will be used but smarter people than us will figure it out and provide instructions. 
Good luck!

Luxemburg? You sure about that? I thought it was to Fidor bank in Germany. Anyway, on a good day the sepa takes 2 hours (same day), usually it's next day, worst case has been after 3 days.

You will get a terrible exchange rate from your bank for the gbp to euro exchange so factor that in to your total cost.

The private key is what has claim on the Bitcoin against an address. 
You can memorise it, write it down on a paper or for convenience sake let a wallet software keep it for you.  It's still 100% yours. 
If your bitcoins are with an exchange then they have the private key for it and you own just a promise that you will get it when you ask for it (nicely).

If you accept fiat then there is no tax problems for you, just for your friend. 
If you accept btc you are liable to pay tax for any gains during the time you held the btc before converting to fiat. 
If you convert to fiat right after receiving btc there is very little gain to be taxed on. 
See if bitpay allows you to send a bill/invoice to your friend. Bitpay converts to fiat before sending it to you.

It's also about spent output. T1 spent the output so it cannot be spent again no matter how long in the future.

Very few because paypal can be reversed but Bitcoin cannot.

"Always always require a pic of the bank deposit slip! Make sure it reflects the correct date and account number. Additionally you should require the ‘buyer’ to write certain information on the face of the receipt before sending a pic to you. For example: “Deposit is for purchase of bitcoin from ‘seller’ to ‘buyer’ via localbitcoins.com” along with the reference number from the LBC transaction. A few ‘seller’s at localbitcoins have been requiring a 5-10 second video of the receipt.
The objective is to ensure as much as possible that the ‘buyer’ actually has the deposit slip themselves and not the ‘victim’. Requiring certain and particular information to be written on the bank deposit slip may make the ‘victim’ think twice about what they’re doing and make things more difficult for the ‘buyer’ to explain."

A very good question that isn't asked often enough by hardware wallet buyers. 
The private key generation is likely much safer inside the hardware wallet than on a personal computer. In fact some users only use the hardware wallet to generate a private key. Once they have a paper backup they wipe the hardware wallet! 
If you do frequent transactions then a hardware wallet is much safer and more practical than a paper wallet. 
If you never transact and only hodl then a ¢10 encrypted paper wallet is very good value and still very secure. Throw in multi sig, Shamir's secret sharing, multiple geographical locations and it's pretty hard to hack. (easy to lose though if you don't know what you are doing) 
@_date: 2016-07-28 08:02:17
A multisig paper wallet distributed geographically is still very hard to beat in terms of availability, price and security. 
Even a trezor requires a paper backup that you have to manage properly. 
Benefit with trezor is if you intend to spend from your cold storage.

An appropriate fee depends on the size of your transaction. Usually the more inputs and outputs you have the bigger the transaction. 
The fee is often measured in sat/byte which is satoshis per byte. 
A very high fee is 400 sat/byte.
Using this real time website you can get an idea of what to pay. 
To me it looks like 241 sat/byte has a high chance of getting into next block and 101 sat/byte is good value.

As is buying things with btc (Bitpay, purse, coffee, etc).

I believe they had the private key to the btc address since it was generated on their hardware wallet (HD wallet).

Are you sure about that? What if Coinbase decides to follow one of the chains only? 
During the eth / etc hard fork I chose to keep my eth and ended up owning both eth and etc. 
The key is to hold your private key.

Very easy to set up buy and sell orders.

Two more? 
More payment options results in more sales. 
They believe in the future of Bitcoin and are keeping a share rather than exchanging all sales to fiat

1. Where are you based? Different countries have different options. 
2. Best time was 2010, second best time is today. 
3. Only spend money you can be without, money you can afford to lose. 
Have a profit margin in mind and pull out when you hit it (30%, 100%, 10x, etc) or just wait (like the rest of us) until Bitcoin is mainstream currency. 
4. Where are you based? Are you android or ios? 
5. Whatever is called btc is probably a safe bet for you!

Every time you create a new address in your wallet there will be a new private key. 
You have to make a new backup every time you create a new address. 
Your wallet is a combination of all addresses and private keys. 
If you plan to destroy you wallet use the "empty wallet" functionality which will send btc from all addresses in your wallet to a single new destination

Apple doesn't allow any purchasing from apps that is not using their in-app purchase (which they take a 40% cut from)

A common mistake is to place sell order instead of buy order. This will then go through right away because the limit price you set will be below market price. 
Or the opposite (accidental buy instead of sell limit order).

I've been waiting for this! Just did the manual download since not available in my play store yet.
Importing a BIP38 encrypted test paper wallet took 80 seconds with clear progress indication.
Export to a BIP38 encrypted PDF was very quick.
This is what I can start recommending to friends and family as ultimate way to secure their mbeeees.

Bitcoin faucet has nothing to do with transferring small amounts of your own bitcoins. 
Get a mobile app, or two, and try transferring. 
Also try an encrypted paper wallet. Latest  Mycelium wallet support import from encrypted paper wallets.

The reason for a hacker to covert your fiat to btc is to move the btc.

What would happen to the market if they sent the btc to a random or invalid address?

Get familiar with various wallets and with transactions. 
Read up on Bitcoin security. 
Most of all spend frequently and rebuy each time you spend in order not feel like lowering your btc stake. 
And tip on reddit to spread the love!

BitBargain.co.uk for instant purchase. 
Slightly above exchange prices but hassle free.

It looks fiddly, how long time does one take?
Did you use any special paper? Double sided I assume?

Maybe it would result in less transactions (which would result in less fees)

BitBargain for no hassle, instant but higher margin buys. 
Kraken.com for cheaper coins if you set up low buy orders and are patient.
