Thanks for link to ledgerwallet, wasn’t aware of this sub reddit. New to the Nano S, learning loads :) 
@_date: 2017-12-21 23:29:36
Thanks, that’s really helpful. Yes, have more than 0.01 and also alts on Nano S/other wallets. I just couldn’t figure out how to get the BTC to my Euro wallet and whether I could send straight to the Euro wallet in BTC... Thanks for clarifying :)

Do you mean Segwit or Legacy? I’m using Legacy...

Thanks :) All clear now! Much appreciated:)

Great post, made me smile :)

Totally agree. I tried all sorts of meditation over a number of years without success and then I found Transcendental Meditation (TM).  Works for me and the more I meditate the better I feel :) working on maintaining the practice though as it’s so easy for “life” to get in the way and before you know it weeks have slipped by without a practice. When really the meditation is the most important 20minutes of the day to give to myself :)

Where’s the address for the Euro wallet deposit? Can’t see it on Coinbase?
@_date: 2017-12-15 11:01:24
Just wondering whether it’s possible on Nano S to transfer to Segwit address from Coinbase? I am aware it’s not a straightforward transfer with LTC, so wanted to get clear before I transfer my BTC? :)

Thanks for info, much appreciated. I’m in UK, not sure if we can use Stripe here for receiving BTC. I will research some more. Also would be great if we could accept BTC as a proportion of payment, say 50/50 BTC/cash... Thanks again :)

If you look at the top of the BTC subreddit there is a pinned post for newcomers. If you scroll down that post it gives a list of different payment systems for accepting BTC in business. I was hoping that those within the community with experience of using these different systems would be able to input on which they think is good/why etc. Would be really helpful to get some user feedback as well as researching myself...

Hi, I’ve just replied to this thread below. Also looking for similar advice. We are an online retailer wanting to accept BTC as payment method. We can’t use Stripe as we are based in the UK. Any thoughts or advice would be much appreciated. Thanks in advance :)

Thanks for the post, really helpful in understanding the concept of futures and what it means for BTC :) 
@_date: 2017-11-03 18:00:29
Same here. Own an online business and also want to start accepting BTC as payment method. I’m a little confused as to best option, as there seem to be several options available. I know you can take payments via Coinbase (as a business and BTC to BTC) and also Stripe (which converts BTC to cash although not available in the UK where I’m
Based).  I haven’t quite figured out the other options (BitPay etc). So would be great for any advice on this from anyone reading this thread. I would really like to be able to take payments and take part in cash (to pay our suppliers who deal in fiat) and part in BTC (company profit). Thanks for this post :)

Great post, great advice, thanks :)

Also based on the UK and want to integrate BTC payments into our online shop (we are an online retailer). Having trouble figuring out how to integrate on our website also....
@_date: 2017-11-03 10:11:18
That’s great���� I have an online business and have been looking at integrating BTC payment system into my website but currently a bit confused with all the different payment options available (Stripe, CoinBase, BitPay etc...).  I definitely think it’s the way forward :)

Thanks for the reply, only just seen it now! Trying to figure out how to buy direct from GDAX right now. Have SEPA all set up but can’t figure out how to get it (GBP to Euros to GDAX) on to GDAX? Have spent 8months buying/transferring via Coinbase (crazy I know, )..... Finally got my head around dollar cost averaging in, so want to stock some Euros onto GDAX. Any tips would be welcome:)
