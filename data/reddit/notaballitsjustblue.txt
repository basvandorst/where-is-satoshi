All investment is gambling. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 10:10:22
Explanation please.
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:32:17
r/bitcoinbeginners is a good sub for those questions.
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:46:58
Eh? We haven’t mined 21,000,000 coins yet.
@_date: 2017-12-11 07:24:01
? This isn’t the price of BTC, just the futures.
@_date: 2018-05-27 15:04:48
Or he had the keys written down and accessible.

I was only joking: I’ve got no idea what Fortrans is.
@_date: 2019-06-25 14:54:34
Not sure that means much: Bojo and the Maybot are pretty closely involved and neither of them seem to have a fucking clue what’s going on.
@_date: 2019-06-25 09:15:55
Those numbers are what I was afraid of.
@_date: 2019-06-25 09:31:33
Ah ok. So the large-value addresses could be exchanges or something?
@_date: 2019-06-25 08:53:32
Ok. And any idea how many whales we’re talking here? 10? 1,000?
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:38:39
Parabolic? Hope not.
@_date: 2019-06-14 13:23:49
Well I used Fortran 3.
@_date: 2017-11-16 17:33:34
So sell the bitcoins and buy different ones. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 14:01:04
Will 2X not lower fees?

I see what you’re getting at I think: that the last ‘bubble’ reached everyone.
Firstly, it didn’t. Secondly, people’s involvement isn’t binary: your in-laws may have bought 0000.1BTC or a larger amount but perhaps next time they will have retained the ability to invest more confidently.
There are many many more people left to get involved and even the people who are already often have plenty left to invest.

I would want the best coin. I might care how it came about but not enough to make a principled stand for a worse coin.
@_date: 2018-02-07 11:07:02
The morality of its upbringing does not necessarily have a direct affect on a coin’s worth.
@_date: 2018-02-07 09:24:05
Read it but all it says is BCH is pretending to be BTC. Yeah sneaky but it doesn’t actually say why BTC is better. In fact, it’s very hard to find anything along those lines anywhere aside from the old ‘Roger Ver is scum, they’re a fork etc’.

That guy in the middle comes across like an arrogant dick.

‘...a potential TV audience of 4.7 billion people’? Well is that all the people with access to TV because it’s a bit of a stupid point if it is.
@_date: 2018-04-04 10:27:19
This is extremely dangerous for our fiat.
