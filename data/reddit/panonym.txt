Well, I don't complain. But you have to admit that if one day bitcoin value fall under 0.00001$ (unlikely, but still) then nobody will care about it (other cryptocurrencies will have the hype).
More than bitcoin (unit) or Bitcoin (protocol), that's the ideas, variations and things we can build with them that matter.
Pretending that the fiat price doesn't matter is true only if fiat get inflated. Gold value or "recognized value" is damn important. Let's not fool ourself. Until we are rich, value does matter.

When I will be rich - I'm gonna give money to so many people AFK! This is gonna be awesome =D
What a better way to develop interest and curiosity than sharing what's better than money ~ cryptocurrencies.
Soon a new website (1st one to come).

I don't agree.
Benevolent state make it easier. That's all. Not absolutely necessary.
If all countries start to use the "illegal flag", then darknet tor and silkroad-like will simply become MUCH more used.
If too many states start to mess with the people, people will say fuck off at one time.

The people will find a way.
Start Internet 2.0 from stratch on darknet if that what it takes.

Awesome post.
Might seem strange to exclusive bitcoin holder, but I really see the cryptos as a whole. It's too early for many to see but they help each other.
With dogecoin, ideas behind crypto&amp;descentralized-all went way deeper "into my soul". What wonderful change we could make to this world if fun were linked to money.
One way or another, cryptocurrencies are here to stay.

True, it's just money. Next time switch your wealth to the sole cipher safe-haven: dogecoin
@_date: 2013-12-18 18:04:47
For the new one who are affraid of rollercoaster: split your wealth between various cryptocurrencies.
I'm lucky, I choosed dogecoin. Which is the ONLY one to have keep risen in the past 12hours. Only one green on coinmarketcap.com, and that's the doge.
In future this will happen with more than one. There is always some deflation going on somewhere. Just have to be lucky.

You can't stop the signal.
The most powerful weapon is not nucs, it's ideas.
