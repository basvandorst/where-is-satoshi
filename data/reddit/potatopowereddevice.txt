Tether is illegal as fuck. Tether isn't used for loans like in fractional reserve banking, if they aren't backed 1-1 they're worth NOTHING. And a huge part of BTC rise is tied to tether. If tether collapses, BTC will collapse at least 1-2k USD from the broad market run it would trigger.

Why do you fanatics always quote Venezuela ? I was one of the early proponents of bitcoin back before this price mania has reduced bitcoin from a cheap payment system to the word of mouth price ponzi it is today.
Venezuela is too complex to blame on fiat policy, they’ve structured their entire economy on oil , Chavez socialism,and US sanctions aren’t helping either. And the only Venezuelans using bitcoin are the super rich to escape the hellhole it is now. The ordinary Venezuelan can neither afford the time or money to buy a highly speculative asset, they are trying to not starve.
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:03:49
You would think so but no. If a person knows that the house they are about to take a loan for is worth 100,000 today but the currency will deflate to 1,000,000 of current dollar value by the time they pay it back, only a moron would take the loan instead of hoarding the currency. Ultimately the banks would get no business. Inflationary currency facilitates business. Deflationary currency is associated with such events such as the Great depression. We aren't in a medieval feudal economy where the lords and barons hoard all the wealth and give breads and circusses to the masses.
@_date: 2018-02-05 20:57:35

I'm a cynicist by nature, even when I had 20+ BTC before I liquidated to like 2 ish, I always gave this theory a 10% chance of success. I'm not going to argue the merits of either systems as most advocates of either fiat or Crypto libertarianism would defend their system to the death.
I will point out that crypto also is inheritently infinite. BTC has a limit, but others like Ether do not, and its way too early to say BTC will win long term. If you had a crystal ball that could tell that, please gimme the lottery numbers for next week.
I will also point out that a little bit of inflation is good for an economy. Think about it this way, if in fact our economy becomes based on a deflationary bitcoin where my bitcoin will be worth more tmmrw than today, I'd be less inclined to invest my BTC in businesses or buy goods and services. I'd want to HOARD it like most people do to BTC today instead of using it to exchange for goods and services. An increasing value is not always great for economies, great for you maybe, short term.

ehh technically anything can be fungible, people used to use cowrie shells for transactions in certain parts of the world. If a hypothetical society existed where cows and sheep were considered legal tender..
I'd argue theres nothing intangible about bitcoin's fundamental value. Its the same as fiat, trust. 
The single biggest obstacle to bitcoin is human greed. Governments have been able to shape and regulate this greed by sheer force. The medieval barons were able to do this with force too and Rome and Ancient China with force and brutality. Crypto doesn't have this option and my bet is strongly against crypto for this reason. Human greed ruins anything that isn't protected by the threat of force and death.

Yes but crypto is much more limited an appeal and a waaaay smaller niche than the internet which has a very wide spreading appeal. Its good to hedge your bets, I still have 2 BTC left to hedge my bets but I'm "out of the market" so to speak. Payed my college tuition for 4 years -- still got one left, got myself a nice savings account/ investment fund and a a few very nice purchases.
But anyways, some last parting food for thought, if crypto gained adoption for a "currency" type use, its value can't swing more than 1 or 2 percent a day if it wants to be taken seriously as a currency. Will 90% of this sub still be as excited for BTC once they realize its as boring as the dollar and they cant HODL to the moon? Thats why I got out, I realized these people would be gone just like that, save for the few true believers.

Crypto is hardly a form of honesty, back in the good old days I used to be part of alt trading groups and the things I saw take place were hardly legal (insider trading, clear pumps and dumps). Its a form of anarchy, which depending on your persuasion is good or bad, up to you.
You have a point with the fungibility aspect, thats why fiat has replaced shells and cows for trade.
Human nature has hardly changed and expectation that human beings will behave nicely in a decentralized unregulated world is a pipe dream imo.

yep, unless 51% attack, just a language difference there sorry. I am aware of the technicals of Bitcoin. Personally i believe in blockchain, not crypto anymore.

The advantage of immutability of BTC relies on the honesty of people, otherwise people will simply use the immutability to their personal advantages and I'd rather bet on my dog learning how to speak tommorow than human beings ever being honest or acting other than for the interest of themselves.

@_date: 2018-02-05 16:10:30
Inherently yes because fiat is designed to be used, if money is saved you lose inflationary value and its bad for the economy because its not going to businesses that need investment. The medieval barons hoarded their money and riches in their castles instead of investing money to develop their lands.
Now I know China, Japan, and SK have high savings rates but those governments (China at least) has very high forex reserves and uses that to facilitate high investments and infrastructure spending.

I'm saying, if it weren't profitable, close to no one would mine. And miners assess that by converting BTC to local fiat because Ik it sounds crazy, they probably pay their electricity bills with fiat. And I'm not here to debate the profitability of mining,  I'm sure it is now. 
@_date: 2017-07-16 04:17:46
I was stating that bitcoin won't help the poorest in the world. The poorest in the world are not concerned with the debate between fiat vs crypto. They're getting shafted left right and center and I think the legitimacy of  fiat and crypto money is way down on their priorities unlike say getting enough food to survive, sanitation, disease prevention, education. And let's face it Bitcoin isn't really used to alleviate any of these problems as of now and the poorest in the world aren't converting their fiat into crypto.

When paper money was introduced, it was a guarantee that that paper could be exchanged for a set amount of gold and silver. Only later did we transition to a fiat based system. And honestly, we don't have enough gold or silver to support the colossal modern economies that we have anymore. For BTC which is limited to 21 million to replace the global fiat denominated economy, a single coin would have to appreciate to the value of 3.7 million USD, an unlikely scenario. We aren't going to all become internet millionaires for buying just one Bitcoin now, as much as I wish that to happen. And that's not to mention the deflationary nature of Bitcoin which would discourage spending and stagnate economies if it truly does replace fiat completely. In many ways I see Bitcoin as like gold, a speculative value holding asset until significant structural changes are made to it. I am excited about crypto currencies as a programmer and an entrepreneur but I don't have blind faith in it and the future I believe is all but certain.

Even companies that take Bitcoin never touch Bitcoin, they receive fiat when you pay BTC. If I were selling merchandise to feed my family/ satisfy my stockholders, why would I take a crypto that sees fluctuations of 4-10% daily. How can I ensure I make my slim slim margin? Unless this rampant speculation stops, Bitcoin will be nothing more than a gold coin.

While as idealistic as that would sound, I'd wager less than 1% of miners would see it that way. Greed powers innovation. Without greed, there would be none. People have to eat, pay rent, mortgages. Not everyone can live with their parents..

That’s like saying the intrinsic value of my shit is the energy investment and time costs that are associated with me going to the bathroom. 
No, you still have to find someone willing to buy your time and effort.

It does help to an extent but can we actually claim BTC is a legitimate alternative currency when even when it accepted it is immediately converted to fiat? My last statement is that the way most people (investors) see it, BTC is an investment like gold, not a currency. Let's not deny that reality today.. As a small time merchandise seller making slim margins, accepting BTC in its pure form not Bitpay is risky.. no matter how I feel about BTC. If I accept BTC and it crashes tomorrow by 10%, I cannot feed myself
Your PayPal analogy is not a one to one, PayPal deals with fiat which historically has been more stable value wise.

In the end it's a vote of confidence, I am just not sure many of current investors even understand BTC.. I have friends invested in BTC and they have no clue what it is.. when the common man can know nothing and make hundreds a day, is it not a bubble. Off topic but my two cents.
I do understand your foreign currency exchange analogy, in a way I can understand. Perhaps BTC is used as a method of facilitating fiat exchange at this point, but until I can use pure BTC to buy a coffee and not worry about the fees being higher than the cost of the coffee, I would not classify BTC as in the same tier of currency fiat is in usage wise at least
I would like to see BYC stabilize, or at least move in percentages close to fiat, it would give it legitimacy in the eyes of the public.

They aren’t. They’re desperately trying to acquire USD , EURO etc. Only a few tech savvy ones are attempting to use btc and even then, it’s only really to quickly exchange bolivars into BTC for a very short time and to exit that out into USD to buy goods.

Probably true.

So I can make money because I'm smart and I plan to convert my BTC back to fiat when BTC is high enough.. I wish more of this sub would just admit this.

As long as there is a free market , there will be exchange rates . The Soviet Union had a fixed exchange rate and a very closed market. Guess what, the ruble still was traded at different rates in the black market.
If you create a “closed market” with a overvalued ratio, people will flood in to sell their underpriced bitcoins, if you create a undervalued market people will buy all the bitcoins in your market and you will be illiquid. The only way to prevent this is to close the market on penalty of death like the USSR and other communist nations did.

But Bitcoin will be 1,000,000 each by 2018 and I will be rich!
