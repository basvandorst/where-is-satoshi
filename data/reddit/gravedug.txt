Interesting, right on, thanks for the insight!

Words like "on"?

Well said.  I got into alt trading a bit recently and it's definitely been a worthwhile learning experience, and super entertaining.  I've had my share of good and bad calls, but overall I've been able to offset fees and come up at least a bit on top, and I'm certainly getting better.  It seems like a solid way to stay engaged while learning about cryptos, and hell, you might make some profit.  I recommend that you go in completely cool with losing what you're playing with though.

Interesting.  Yeah, I was just thinking that as long as the consensus of the majority is backing bitcoin, there's meaningful strength in that, regardless of the specific pros and cons.  But yeah, you might be on to something.

Ah, I appreciate the response.  I don't believe in 400 coins, I think I worded that badly.  What I meant was, the coins that I have been looking into have all been among the top 400, and I noticed a trend of what looks to me like relative legitimacy.  I just guessed that there could be 400 coins with some actual integrity, but fuck if I know.

It can be fun to do a little research and pick a horse, but u rite.  Since I've been messing around with some alt-coin trading I'm narrowly better off for it.  If it weren't for fees, which I am gradually learning how to avoid, I'm pretty sure I would have amassed a decent profit by now.  I always keep the majority in the big three though.  To be honest, more than anything else, it's probably just a way to feel active in the scene throughout my fascination with cryptocurrencies.

Forgive my ignorance cause I'm still figuring a lot of this out, but genuinely asking, aren't many of them just competing for relevance, and isn't that okay or even good?  From what I can see, some try to tweak their strategy and fill a new or different need with their alts, but even with the ones that overlap in their claims or plans, aren't there degrees of quality in things like tech, security, design, and whatever else?  I never thought of them as scams (well, other than the several that definitely are scams), but more-so as vying for their place in this rising cryptocurrency phenomenon.

Roughly how many alt coins are there total? I realize I could probably figure this out on my own but I probably am not going to lol. I've been glued the coinmarketcap site for a while now though and among most of the top few hundred coins that I've checked out, there are extensive trails of fleshed out websites with legit videos and roadmaps, and usually a good amount of seemingly objective media evidence, social or otherwise. For your statement to be true there'd have to be what like, 400,000 alts?
@_date: 2018-02-21 23:17:57
Yeah, but only in retrospect though, right?  I imagine it's always at least a bit more risky to put your money into one of the competing alts.  Unless there's something I'm missing.

This is a good poem.
