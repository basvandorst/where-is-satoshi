I find it hilarious that you think not advertising a way to make less money is an ethical and moral issue.
They're cutting down rainforests and you're over here like "Hey this company isn't advertising all their services, get them!".

I think this is the first comment I've seen recommending people keep coin on an exchange.
Why in the world would you think that they're safer there as opposed to say your own paper wallet?

I'm just not sure what you expect anyone to do about it, it's legal, it's a business, I would do the same if I was them; hell I would probably make it harder to find out. They have the simple easy to use Coinbase site to attract the masses and sure they make the customer pay the transaction fee for withdrawal just like many other exchanges.
GDAX is designed more for advanced users and traders and I'm sure is paying transaction fees just to get customers they wouldn't get otherwise through coinbase alone. They know if anyone using coinbase actually looks into it that they'll be able to move to GDAX for free fees and still keep the customer in their network.

Yes pretty sure it does. I don't know what businesses you've ever worked for but most of them aim to make the most money they can.

That really wouldn't change anything if the reseller was modifying real trezors; but would be nice for other reasons.
Read this a few weeks back when choosing between ledger and trezor.


Now what others are saying about loading your own firmware definitely do that but I doubt everyone will.

I wasn't trying to say you were doing this, just that it's a possibility with the hardware.
Looks like you also sell Ledgers those I would trust a bit more with a reseller.

In addition you can sign into gdax.com which is also coinbase, and transfer from there for free as they cover the fee.
