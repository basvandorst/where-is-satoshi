And when there isnt enough inflation, the Fed freaks out. But why cant we raise the minimum wage? because they say it will cause inflation (even though it really wont). 
Our monetary policy is so far removed from what the propaganda machines say it is, that our biggest obstacle is still getting the public to wrap their mind around using anything but fiat.

you can also set money to be spent at a certain time, create self-executing contracts, mine it with electricity, divide it by over a million, destroy the fed and fuck over the banks. Fiat does literally none of those things

well yeah, obviously someone could be an idiot and buy well above market value by clearing out all of the sells in an exchange.  But more than likely, if we are ever going to see a thousand dollar bitcoin, it will take a hell of a lot more than $5,000,000 and its going to take a while.
I just threw out the 8 billion number because thats what the market would have to be worth (not necessarily how much has been invested), i misspoke.

Countries with undervalued money actually have an advantage when it comes to a lot of economic sectors. Tourism increases because foreigners can buy cheap goods in your country, also labor is relatively cheaper so foreign companies are often more likely to open facilities in countries with undervalued currencies.
I don't like the idea of national currencies though. Or fiat in general, it creates strife.

you cant just move somewhere. You have to get a job offer in one of a few specific industries. Then you have to go through a bunch of bureaucracy (going to embassies, expensive forms), have a large amount of cash in your bank account and spend a lot of money moving in to a new home.
Also most countries don't respect property rights and many are hostile to foreigners (especially Americans)

no, the excess of labor in a 21st century economy (along with a decline in unions, workers rights, import taxes, education, etc...) diluted the value of a two-income household. And either way, it has nothing to do with inflation...

No, you are in denial of the fact that the only reason that women were subjugated is because they used to be poorer than men. Now that they have money, they have rights. Believe it or not, the money came first. 
Our current system only listens to money. The more you have, the louder you are. It doesnt give a fuck whether you are a man or a woman, black or white.
The only reason people are rude to blacks or Mexicans is because they are assumed to have less money. Wealthy minorities have no problems in capitalist societies, that has been the case for centuries.
You can exclusively blame men for capitalisms downfalls, but that only turns you into the ignorant sexists that you were trying to fight to begin with.
Also, I am a communist who believes in equal rights, you're not talking to some sexist banker shill in denial. I am the real fucking deal. I think that capitalism is about to fall on its face, and it deserves it. But I know for a fact that women are not inherently communist (which seems to be a belief you hold), we need to educate and reform everyone.
@_date: 2015-02-19 10:54:07
well of course, thats why we should replace our central bank with an algorithm that distributes currency much more fairly and efficiently (without creating debt) without the federal reserve. Then our taxes could all go to schools and roads and NASA

Capitalism is a construct born out of the 1600s when Adam Smith and the Physiocrats  spread the idea of deregulating traditional Mercantilism (while protecting property rights) to increase GDP.
It was the most innovative, controversial, liberal type of economy at the time. It ended the government-mandated wage caps on low-income workers in industrialized England.
It ended a lot of "patriarchal" practices that were going on at the time. Also, during that time, the purchasing power of women went up dramatically.
Dont get me wrong, I think we could do a lot better than capitalism. But to say that the system (in which women are currently thriving) is built to devalue women is ludicrous.

I like free roads and public schools. And if we could pay for it with interest on currency holdings instead of income tax and quantitative easing, that would be fantastic. 
@_date: 2015-02-19 11:04:52
I'm not sure you received the concept I am proposing...
I am promoting the creation of a proof of stake coin that earns 4~% interest every year. A small portion of the interest from each coin goes into a trust to fund major public projects.
With a system like that, no debt is created and we wouldn't be robbed of the hours we work.
