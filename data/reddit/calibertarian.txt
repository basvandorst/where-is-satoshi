Good question! 
Blockchain.info's wallet through their website is essentially that. And Coinbase's wallet through their website is basically that, too.
The problem I keep running into when I think about making a full wallet running from a webapp is control over private keys and where the wallet itself is stored. Blockchain.info has a pretty big operation and high server costs, etc, since they host everything themselves. Same with Coinbase. We see competition on the computer wallet front because there isn't that huge barrier to entry that is upkeep and responsibility for other people's money that online wallets have.
The reason I'd love to have Electrum as an iPhone app is that with the seed, you can have multiple machines with your active wallet on it, just like you can have multiple credit cards for your family. It is such a hassle for me to transfer BTC from my main wallet on my computer to my blockchain.info wallet when I want to be mobile. I just don't feel comfortable keeping a lot of BTC on Blockchain.info all the time. If I had basically a mobile copy of my Electrum wallet, that would be awesome. The block chain keeps them all in sync, so no trouble there. And no need to download the whole block chain because it is accessed via remote servers.

My Dad is an awesome man. When I told him about bitcoin, he read up on it and asked my recommendations on where to buy it. He now has his own wallet and uses it!
@_date: 2014-01-09 03:36:43
Didn't know that. Thank you!
@_date: 2014-06-03 18:28:27
I'm not sure, sorry. My Dad is a huge ebayer and got it there. 
I think this is an awesome white bitcoin shirt, though:

And just told me about  's features, and what I said sounds a heck of a lot like their system, except they use a seed, so no need for downloading a wallet. I love it!

Looks like you linked the results page. Here is the home page of the debate:

Also, check this thread. Looks like most of the wallets got pulled for not complying with Apple's rules, not for being bitcoin-related. There are still working iPhone wallets. 
@_date: 2014-01-09 02:40:32
Why, exactly? CoinJar is still in the store.

One feature that I think would be awesome on a mobile wallet is to import a wallet.dat file, use it, then purge. 
Let's say I'm out with friends. One wants to pay in BTC but only has a wallet on her computer, doesn't have a smartphone, lost her phone, whatever. She could just log in to her Google Drive, Dropbox, or email from my phone, open the .dat in the client, decrypt it with her long passphrase, pay someone, then just purge the wallet from the client.

Here is a little rhyme for y'all:
Wealth is what is valued and value is subjective
What one values depends on one's perspective
One man's trash is another man's treasure
One man's pain is another man's pleasure
One man's work is another man's leisure
All things you must remember before you start to measure

Ed Moy has been really positive about Bitcoin:

No worries, you sound like an idiot, too. 
I visited my parents for the weekend and my Dad proudly told me he got a bitcoin shirt, so we snapped a photo together. It was a long day, so we are both exhausted.

A shot of me using the Lamassu cash-to-bitcoin ATM at the CCC: 
It was really slick! They had a few issues with wifi in the morning, but was flawless all afternoon. Really simple UI and I changed $20 to BTC in a matter of moments. And right after I hit submit, it showed up in my Blockchain. Really awesome.

My wife made bitcakes (delicious crypto-currency cupcakes) for Bitcoin's 5th birthday, complete with block candles.

I did this today with 7 of my friends to whom I sold books. I convinced 3 of them to start using bitcoin.

I talked to Ohanian in NYC last week during his book tour. He seems to be more than cautiously optimistic... he invests in Buttercoin and Coinbase. This is a man who doesn't throw his money around lightly and who believes in his investments. He also talks about Coinbase a lot on Twitter.
My guess is that he was reserved for the media, but really believes in BTC.

What Sunde is missing is that new technologies are rendering the State obsolete in its current format and forcing politicians and political systems to change.
The Pirate party is noble, but whatever kind of meat you put into a grinder comes out looking the same. Incentives exist and everyone acts on them. I'm not optimistic at all that we can vote ourselves freedom. We can, however, make new things that force the political system to change to suit us if it wants to survive.
Like John Robb said, "governments are a legacy system for managing physical space." When less and less of our lives and interactions are in the physical space, government will be forced to adapt.

Got to use this today. Changed $20 in seconds. It had a few wifi issues in the morning, but then was pretty flawless all afternoon. Really simple, intuitive UI. Can't wait to see these all around.

Sorry, my bad! Yes, the ATM was up and running. I changed $20. The crew from Atlanta Bitcoin ( had theirs up and running, as well as a guy who has a prototype for a machine that works without internet access. Both were very cool.

You put in cash, scan your wallet QR and it deposits the BTC equivalent of the cash minus a fee (3.25% if I remember correctly) directly into your wallet.

He also discusses it as a medium of exchange, regulation, where currency is going, and the number of bitcoins created.
