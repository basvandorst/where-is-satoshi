What does running a Node mean? Can anyone do it and does the operator get compensated?

I think Portugal has no net neutrality and it has ended up like this...
My main concern is that Bitcoin or any other crypto network can be squeezed to death by any ISP if a fee is not paid. Is that a valid concern or can a blockchain find a way around? Is the Blockstream satellite network a viable solution?

Stick to what you are doing! You seem to have a healthy amount of stocks and Bitcoin, sensibly diversified. Apple would seem to be a 'safe' stock in the short / medium term (no-one can predict the future, Apple has tanked before they may do again) so treat Bitcoin like a gamble. 
Bitcoin could go to the moon, or it could collapse overnight. It's a binary bet -either worth zero or a metric shit-ton. Only put money in that would not adversely impact your life if you lost it. 
Enjoy the ride!

Dear God man they are cursed satoshi's! 
You ever see the japanese film Ring? Yeah so Satoshi Nakamoto didn't vanish, he was murdered and his ghost sends 10000 sats every Halloween and tracks his victim through the blockchain.  For the love of God send them on before it's too late.

Err no, I don't want a dead programmer crawling out of my laptop thanks. Thats how the murdering starts.

In the crypto world I've been reading about 'oracle's' and how they might be involved in sidechains or 2nd layer networks. What is an Oracle?
