The other thing that makes us dependent on third parties (like blockcypher.com), 10 minute confirmations. I can't emphasize how many sites want to incorporate bitcoin, but have a "we'll credit you when we have one confirmation" policy, which is incredibly inconvenient and turns people away. Let's get those confirm times down.
@_date: 2015-06-28 14:34:41
Yes fundamentals are key to everything everywhere. But valuation is always relative, and it folds back on itself (comparing the price of a security against previous prices and potential future prices) is chartwork. Timing is chartwork. Trading differs from investing because it involves more precise timing. Shorter timeframes are where chartwork comes in, and it works across all financial asset classes, as a tool. Never as a guarentee.

I bought into Satoshi's vision. Bitcoin as a global currency and payment network. Not as 3 tps max or whatever has been sanctified lately. And at the very least if the proposal is to leave it that way for a few years, some code should be presented to deal with this problem:

Yep, that sounds about right. Got to coordinate carefully in order to not get involved in the speculation game. The only difference is I would simultaneously buy the same amount of dollars being used to purchase bitcoin on stamp with the client's pesos, in mexico. There would still be the threshhold in dollars on stamp as well of course. The idea is to absolutely eliminate any exposure to volatility, of all currency pairs. Makes sense in my head anyway, as long as really favorable usd/mxn exchange rate are attainable for small purchases in Mexico. 
It would look like: simultaneous  MXN-&gt;USD-&gt;BTC  purchase. The cost of these conversions would be included in the quoted exchange rate on volabit or whathaveyou.

Yeah you're right. The speed of transactions doesn't matter. 
You know with cash I don't have to wait for a confirmation to absolutely know I have the money in my hands. I'd like the same thing with bitcoin, and who wouldn't. Besides me, systems of all types would work better with faster confirm times.
I also don't like to wait 15 minutes when I send bitcoin to get credit. Like gamerholic or leetcoin. They also won't reduce it to zero confirm because they'll be scammed. Wouldn't it be nice if they had the option to go with 2.5 minutes or one minute? Most users don't have 15 minutes of patience, that may be one of the reason gamerholic is having such a hard time getting users, along with a multitude of other sites. 
I recall reading the googlemaps was having trouble getting their userbase up, and then were able to load the map a few fractions of a second faster and their userbase exploded.
And I know we can add trusted third parties and multisig to speed this up. But wasn't the point to eliminate those? 
I can sense you're not focusing on UX. We need to keep focus on what people are turned off by, solicit negative feedback, address those issues if at all possible now; it won't get any easier as time goes on.

True, DACs will always rely on data from 3rd parties. But that doesn't make a DAC any less of one. All economic entities operate with outside data. It's the ability to choose and discard which data to use that give an entity its leverage and autonomy, and not having to rely on any one source for existence (say the servers of an oracle).
I'm going to give Gavin's paper another reread to see if I'm missing something though.

Totally. The way I see it is as long as your coins are old enough on the chain, risk is very limited. 
That is not to say that market price couldn't or wouldn't plummet while problem is being worked out. That being said, history shows us price recovers after it is fixed, and it becomes clear that problems are fixable.

I *love* this software. 
Have you considered Quicken-like features, with categories, tagging, accounts? That would be incredible. Ideal for commercial use, a one-stop shop for all banking/accounting/division of control needs. Total control over funds, 24/7, your own powerful online banking in which you can give signing power to employees at anytime, and revoke as you see fit. Integrate it with quickbook capabilities, with automatic realtime budgeting (automatically restricts signing power once budget is reached), expense reports, etc, and you have a very powerful business tool.
I would make the focus of the UI a compact transaction ledger (with categories), and build everything around that. Make the payment functions available, but less prominent. Basically provide the user with total financial control, where they would simultaneously make a payment and categorize it, so that accounting data entry and check-writing being two separate activities becomes obsolete.
To my mind this could be Bitcoin's killer app.

Yeah, would be cool if someone from one of these companies could get on here and tell us how it's done.
I'm not saying you keep your USD in mexico, you'd want to build up reserves and then send them over to stamp via wire in bulk like you were saying, because wire transfer fees are fixed. The USD would just sit in your mex USD account building up in the meantime. There would be some float.
Your earnings would be the portion you charge the customer as service fee, and that would stay in Mexico.

Aprox world monetary base: 70 trillion / 21 million = 3,333,333.33 USD per bitcoin / 1,000,000 = 3.33 USD per bit
This is an extremely optimistic back of the napkin calculation of bitcoin replacing most world money, and it adds up to around 3 bucks per bit. I think Satoshi was deliberate and spot on to choose 100,000,000 units per bitcoin, and that the bit (or microbitcoin) is the most critical denomination we'll be looking at in our lifetimes (hopefully).

I talk about this with anyone that will listen. I mean, that's where the nearly 3 trillion of newly created money went, and nobody ever talks about it, not in the news, economists don't mention it, nobody.  Lots of talk about QE, little talk about where 80% of it went. Mind-boggling.
The obvious truth is QE was mostly a cover to buy up mostly bad debt and toxic loans from banks, a slight of hand. They had to stuff the money somewhere to avoid price inflation, so they began paying interest on uncirculated excess reserves for the first time in 2009. So here we are sitting under the avalanche now. Obviously if inflation picks up because excess reserves enter the economy, the fed will raise that .25% interest for excess reserves to try to soak circulating currency back up. 
Problem is, they can't raise fed funds rate above the excess reserves rate, or money will seep out of excess reserves, so what will happen is if inflation picks up, they'll raise both rates together. But what if they have to jack up rates to 15% or so, like during the 70's? Imagine 15% of 3 trillion! That's 450 billion a year, compounded. It will be like a desperate backdoor QE, paid out to banks, just increasing the money supply indefinitely. That will cause the opposite of the desired affect, eventually. It's not a sustainable situation.
Fed's playing with fire here.

I don't believe the price drop to be "manipulation" any more than the 2011 correction was. I don't think I'm uninformed, which is why I was turned off by the statement. This is just the hangover from the party, and I don't think there needs to be a grand theory behind it, there are plenty of participants affecting the price, in aggregate. Also, I haven't read the term "whale" in any trading or investing literature anywhere. I did hear it on the movie Casino.
Of course there are large holders pushing down the price. They're as concerned as anyone else out there of tying up an asset that liquidates at less than they paid for it for potentially a long while, or of having to hold off on their dreams/life plans if they bought in early.
I didn't mean for that to come off as a slight on btc traders, there are of course really good ones out there. I don't think it's a secret many of them are new to trading though.

Exactly. I've seen a large scale miner mention this in interview at coin-summit. 
    30 minutes, cloudhashing.com executive nods
He said the best time to buy mining equipment is right after a run up, and that there is a trade-off decision to be made about holding bitcoin and going to fiat. I see the whole thing happening in waves, where toward the end of each cycle mining becomes unprofitable, miners hold, and price becomes sensitive to good news, then skyrockets. Maybe they're not conscientiously holding, perhaps institutional investors were buying from them at discount in bulk off-exchange (like secondmarket), but are then denied these discounts when cost increases, causing these institutional investors to buy on exchanges at some point and drive up exchange demand.
I can't think of any other commodity/asset class that behaves like bitcoin, where the supply being created doesn't increase when the price rises, where only cost to produce increases.

This sounds useful. Like something that could be used to track the ownership of bonds/title/ownership. What would be really neat is if the present owner of the asset could sign a  public key(that changes when the ownership changes) which would verify his ownership of that asset to others. Is this possible? That way you could have a website that gives access to, say, itunes credit, and the method of access would be whoever could sign the correct public key for that asset (access). It sort of decentralized working registration method. The owner could sell all his itunes credit simply by transferring the colored coin.

I can think of one. Shapeshift.io takes minimum 10 minutes to confirm receiving bitcoin before sending out litecoins. With litecoins, they take 2.5 minutes to do the same. I think comparing the security between the two coins has a low relevance here, I know that getting 1 confirm with bitcoin is better than getting one with litecoin. But, the difference here is that the developer had the OPTION of waiting only 2.5 minutes to get a confirm with litecoin. Granularity. I enjoy waiting 2.5 minutes more than waiting 10 minutes. Isn't this a good reason to speed up block times? User experience and allowing the developer more granularity in security vs wait time?

Yes, or alternatively they'll continue to raise that excess reserves rate of .25% indefinitely. If inflation picks up and they're forced to raise fed funds rate they'll also be forced to raise the excess reserves rate. Imagine a 70's style 15% fed funds rate and 16% excess reserves rate. That would be half a trillion in subsidy to the banks each year to keep those trillions of base money at bay. Back against the wall as money supply balloons ad infinitum.

You're loosely describing the money multiplier. When an economy is heating up and money is being lent, 1 USD of base money can effectively become 10 USD as it is lent over and over successively, and appears on account balances for multiple account holders. This is fractional reserve. Right now banks aren't lending, people aren't borrowing, so they aren't touching those funds in excess reserves, and they are not being credited to any personal or business bank accounts. They just sit on the fed's balance sheet collecting .25% until banks are ready to use it. This is unprecedented because before 2009 no interest was paid out on reserves, and there was little money kept in excess reserves, it all circulated and the money multiplier was working.
Now, the way I see it, Fed has a politically convenient way to continue applying QE for a time to come, as they adjust interest rate applied to excess reserves and that money continues to enter the economy and circulate.
If and when the economy does start heating up again, that's when we have the potential for inflation.

Back of the napkin calculation shows I paid Western Union 1.92% more than the xe.com exchange rate for sending 60 bucks in July, and an additional 5 USD in transfer fees. That is based on the xe.com historical rate for that day, which lacks some granularity (forex fluctuates throughout the day, just like bitcoin)
When I sent the .5 BTC the rate was about 13.3 pesos to 1 USD on xe.com, and about 360 USD to 1 BTC on stamp. So the spread from exchange difference cost me about 2.5%. Transfer fees happened to be about or just under $5 on this as well, but were a function of amount sent, so would have been less than WU had I sent only $60 USD, unless their formula has a minimum.
I'll double check this for accuracy in a few hours when I have better access to the volabit figures.

Here's Nick's most head-on discussion about bitcoin:  He pretty explicitly explains the difference between his version of bit gold and bitcoin (namely the constant issuance model in bitcoin vs. his demand based issuance model). If he's Satoshi then I'm surprised he's being this specific in distancing himself from the project. You can sure tell he feels a sense of ownership of the idea based on the post though, rightly so.

Onename uses the open name system format to interact with the namecoin blockchain. The namecoin blockchain was designed for DNS; as a domain registery or in this case it's being used for decentralized bitcoin address registry. The nice thing here is that even if onename were dead and gone, the registry would still be available for lookup to anyone, and also is editable by any service that obeys the open name systems format to interact with it. So what we have here is an effort to create an industry standard to simplify bitcoin address readability to something more like an email addresses.

Bitcoin handles the money aspect, yes, but how about storage and code execution? That's what they're aiming for. Running applications "in the cloud" and decentralizing that cloud. If the programs are money makers, they continue to persist by paying their keep to hosts/miners. This is a Decentralized Autonomous Corporation. Will it likely fail? Yes. Think of it as a big science experiment in the name of cryptography. I think everyone buying ether gets that, judging by the myriad disclaimers upon purchase.

I like the idea, but. I still can't get my head around why people will build a sidechain instead of their own coin. The incentive for most to build their own coin is to reap the monetary rewards of a successful coin. A sidechain won't provide this. I understand the desire to eliminate "pump and dump" but I don't very immediately see what will cause people to drop their own mining schemes for this one.
Perhaps I can understand this in the context of IBM or Google working on the internet of things type blockchains. That I can understand, because of the idea that bitcoin ecosystem provides the most strength and longevity. Could be that this is what Blockstream is aiming for.
But a new ethereum type sidechain? Won't the designers still want to build off their own coin in order to reap the rewards?

Hmmmm..... Gavin is beginning to recognize the genius of Ethereum, and sees that bitcoin may have real competition. His thoughts parallel mine: it's perhaps too ambitious of a project for its own good, and will be a security nightmare, making it hard to establish trust as bitcoin has, by doing one thing really well (important for money!). Would love to be proven wrong though. For the record, I support Ethereum, I don't care how long it takes them, someone will get it right within 10 years I believe. The concept of the DAC is just too cool, too efficient, and will change the world. 
What Gavin doesn't address is, bitcoin will never spawn a DAC (it is a DAC, but cannot be used to build and operate others). Oracles centralize trust, and place the operation of the contract code in the hands of the trust providers. The DAC would not be a DAC if run through an Oracle. It may be a highly efficient entity, but would be at its heart a centralized institution with centralized permission and an expiration date, as far as I can gather.

BitPay and others process roughly $2 million to $4 million in bitcoin transactions globally in aggregate every day, Mr. Crohn said. The processor holds the bitcoin and makes money by selling it at a higher price than where it was bought.
“If the price is going down, I have nothing to minimize my downside risk,” Mr. Crohn said. **All BitPay can do right now is hold bitcoin and wait for the price to increase**, he said.

Even with venture capital raising.. How do the VC's monetize? 
Maybe the idea is to take the profit motive out of coin development. Go back to open source dev how it used to be. But I wonder if developers will do that when they have the option to profit.
There's no denying the bitcoin devs feel their work has been ripped off a thousand times and their future work will continue to be copied, they are trying to defend their IP in a way.

This is a pretty good idea. I mean, if stores would have the policy of issuing receipts with bitcoin addresses on them with the bitcoin loaded, They would no longer have to run a till. Receive cash, but not have to deal with giving cash back, counting the till at the end of their shift, making bank runs to get proper change etc. They wouldn't need to issue a card or create an account for their customer; the customer wouldn't need to have a debit card or anything like that. The customer could trade their coin for cash at a nearby bitcoin atm of their choosing.
Obviously there are some kinks to work out here, but in principle, this could be useful for some businesses.

Consumer debt is tapped out. The funds are going straight into the stock market, emerging market bonds, junk bonds, share buy backs, etc..., as banks search for yield.
Thats why whenever QE is scaled back, and in decades past before QE, when interest rates were raised via fed funds rate and FOMC ops (kind of an ongoing mini QE to set interest rates), we see emerging market economies falter, because investment decreases in their bonds.

"Myself, Wei Dai, and Hal Finney were the only people I know of who liked the idea (or in Dai's case his related idea) enough to pursue it to any significant extent until Nakamoto (assuming Nakamoto is not really Finney or Dai).

Yes, the open market committee can sell bonds to soak up the monetary base. I believe it was Warren Buffet that said recently, and I paraphrase,, "the question is, will there be buyers?"

How do you think btc will top that anytime soon, with coinbase increasing its payroll every day (god knows why they need so many employees) and circle admitting they will need more VC money next year.

I'm not sure what this quote refers to as being "unsustainable." The market price levels? Remember, a market is a price that represents participants' perceived value of an asset. Perceptions of value can "sustain" for a very long time. Money flows from one market to another. So when you make money in a particular market, it may be that someone else lost money in another market, when funds were extracted from that market and directed into yours. The reverse is also true. A price on a market can be sustained, even with no trade taking place, as long as no one feels the price is too high or low and/or is motivated to liquidate.
edit: My use of the word "market" is in the investment sense on the exchanges, not the broader macro sense.

Nobody will try to destroy bitcoin. Entities will however, seek to control it.

@_date: 2015-08-18 05:48:43
Paradoxically, it also makes bitcoin a considerably less attractive investment for savers. If you need a 500 GB download just to confirm you received and hold coins, how is this monetary sovereignty, and how is it a better alternative to gold as a safe haven? It isn't. There was a group that thought the amount of transactions was the most important factor in determining market cap. These were the tipping dogecoiners. Number of transactions is not nearly as important as safe haven store of value for determining the value of this currency.
@_date: 2015-08-25 14:31:57
Well, investors would need to know or feel secure beforehand that XT wouldn't centralize and make their investment less secure. The block limit growth rate is arguably excessive.

Certainly true for me and has already affected my buying/selling decisions. A splitting asset just doesn't seem like a safe haven store of value. Whether Bitcoin splits or not is beside the question. Until that question is resolved, it will hang on a lot of investors' minds, perhaps until January which is the earliest point at which larger blocks can activate.

I've been seeing posts wondering whether the supercomputer exists. Here is a reputable list of the top 500 fastest supercomputers that is maintained regularly. The Tulip Trading supercomputer, made by SGI and Supermicro, as Craig claims, operating out of Australia, appears on the list.    June 2015
   November 2014
Also, here's Craig teaching a lecture on what appears to be that same computer, with a tulip made of ascii characters on the terminal.

Ok, one spelling error in 80,000 words is in fact a very achievable feat by one human with a spell checker. Point conceded troll. Now remove your head from your arse and read for context:
"Come on, just read some of this joke of a person’s online ramblings and ask yourself – would you hire or work with this guy… ever? Keep in mind the intellectual capacity at which Satoshi was working, and the fact that it is widely known that he only made one spelling error throughout his tenure."
My point is, if you can follow, is that doing language comparisons and analysis, as endorsed by this blog, will not yield meaningful results if Satoshi Nakamoto's statements and online posts were the collaborative effort of a small group rather than a single individual.
Also, I recon your "making fun of me" has more to do with coming across a non group-think opinion leaving open the possibility that Dr. Craig Wright is in fact Satoshi, an opinion that you don't agree with.

In response to this article, I don't recall now where I read it, but it has been recently suggested by JVP or Grigg that the Satoshi Nakamoto pseudonym postings were jointly edited by two or more individuals, hence his superhuman spelling powers and other abilities. Also, there are emails that were brought to light by I believe Gizmodo where CSW is emailing and asking Dave Kleinman to help create a better version of himself. *edit- Here is where Grigg discusses the team aspect of the SN persona:

Lol, we'll see. I FEEL I hope you are right, and this is not Satoshi in order to uphold a strong unadulterated identity with Bitcoin and the initial movement which was a huge thrill for me. That being said, I've made my stand, I FEEL strongly I should stick with it, because I've made it, and because it differentiates me from the crowd, which FEELs good and strokes my ego. Also because I sense I've got a very good shot probabilistically at being right on this matter based on my time spent analyzing it. After all, all things are subject to interpretation whichever interpretation prevails at a given time is a function of power and not truth. (not my words) But, usually something more closely resembling truth is broadly recognized in the end. (my words)
Humility before the crowd endears you, but is not an indicator of actual truth, what it does is better drives consensus truth which is not always the same thing (CSW would agree). Same goes for signal to noise, it's just one factor in a much bigger picture. Sorry Vitalik. 
@_date: 2017-07-03 16:02:19
Some possibilities: Initially anonymous because there was no telling how governments would react to Bitcoin, he likely feared prison time. He values his privacy. Sometimes people want credit and also privacy, paradoxically enough. Other possibilities: the terms of the Tulip Trust as agreed on with other members (who may want to remain anonymous as well). Situation with Australian Tax authorities. He went public to fulfill his obligations with his new financial backers. Why financial backers if he's rich? Because it looks like he tied up the bitcoin in the Tulip Trust that will become available at some future date. He probably needed financial backing just to build Bitcoin, which took a team and likely employees, which made him beholden to his backers before even producing the protocol. This would explain the Tulip Trust situation, which likely has multiple beneficiaries. Also, it was set up outside of Australia to skirt rigid Austrialian tax law. He is obviously emotionally not terribly stable, well, if you had a billion plus in bitcoin that you couldn't access that was as volatile as hell, and that was your creation that nobody acknowledged and you didn't even have access to the bitcoin, wouldn't you be a bit emotionally unstable as well? Granted he is more so than most.
@_date: 2016-05-09 12:35:17
So it's unanimous? Everyone here rules out the possibility that CSW invented Bitcoin and many ridicule him despite quite a lot of evidence in his favor? What a hivemind this reddit is.

No, but anecdotal evidence tends to be a good hint. If all your friends are getting excited about something "good" about to happen in my experience it rarely does. People are about as rational as their emotions allow them to be, and groups have an outsize affect on emotions.

I think Dr. CSW is very possibly Satoshi. Too many independent confirming reports to be a con. Too weird and too many years in the making to be made up.
@_date: 2017-07-02 14:44:45
CSW is probably who he says he is. The preponderance of evidence points to this for anyone that has spent more than just a few hours looking into it. The truth doesn't care about one's ideology and associated self image. The inventor of Bitcoin doesn't have to be a pleasant socially pleasing guy, it actually makes more sense that he isn't in fact. Individualism, libertarianism, etc.. is the world view of choice for those that don't always play well with others, that put themselves first. Let's face it. The truth doesn't care about our feelings on the matter. (I too wish CSW was a more likable guy.)

I don't think one should form a conclusive opinion on this without spending over 10 hours researching it online, with an open mind. Don't listen to those with clout that have a horse in the race. Take the time to follow the breadcrumbs. I've come to the conclusion it adds up. It's strange and weird and bizarre, as are all things Bitcoin it seems, but it added up in my mind when I took the time to look over the facts. Time will tell, but I usually get this type of thing right. In the meantime I get to watch the majority tear down the creator of Bitcoin, which is not fun. Not fun at all. And also regarding my feelings, I wish it wasn't him. But my mind tells me it is after reviewing as many facts as I can get a hold of, so I've got to defer to that.

@_date: 2017-07-04 03:45:30
Lol. Yeah I know. Just piecing together the trail of breadcrumbs I've come across. Not an Occam friendly theory, no not at all. But what would Occam have to say about a man that has been in the cypherpunk sphere since the mailing list, posting there (just a few hundred subscribers) in the early nineties. A man that is a staunch libertarian, has studied all the right subjects and then some, is a tireless (wacky) entrepreneur, owns a supercomputer, specializes in low level coding, cryptography and opsec, knows his math, with evidence he at the very least purchased or mined bitcoin in 2009 if nothing else, with others in the cryptosphere who claim to be basically members of the satoshi team (indirectly), and drop hints left and right on twitter. The reports from Klieman's employee and family about how adamant he was about recovering his computer after he passed. How would Occam explain all that, with something simpler than he's Satoshi? And there's plenty of other clues and substantiating evidence. It would be the most elaborate hoax. He'd have to be CIA with a lot of backing or something to pull something that elaborate off if he is in fact faking it.

His blog posts are not quite as eloquent or deep as Szabo's work, but very true and insightful points all of them.  What catches my attention about Craig is the breadth of his academic knowledge, mixed with a very hands-on nature. He's manically active, learning/doing/learning/doing/learning/doing junkie. If you think about it, this is the kind of guy that might stumble on the Nakamoto consensus and would actually do something about implementing it. I recall Nassim Taleb mentioning this in one of his books... "stochastic tinkering" or... the kind of trial and error learning that historically leads to innovation.

Bitcoin was the world's first DAC. Think about it. It's a system that incentivizes humans to do work for it (the miners), compensates them (with bitcoin), in order to grow and protect itself (against 51% attacks).
There are still a lot people who have not yet made this distinction, but imo it's likely that future history books will point this out.  It will also be the first of many.  AND as bitcoin grows in recognition and use, people will trust the SYSTEM more, and may end up trusting the validity of organizations registered with it as well.  As if it were a government.
