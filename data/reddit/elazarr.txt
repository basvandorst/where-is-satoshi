lol where is this!
@_date: 2013-05-27 18:33:46
it doesnt harm, but it does spam the blockchain, making the transaction fees slowly go up, SD probly takes atleast half of all transactions, if not now it definetly did at some point,

interesting, bitfinex seems not so userfriendly, is there any other easier to use sites?
also i dont understand how this works, if you lend btc and the person that borrowed it loses it, how do you still get reinburst? from where?
@_date: 2013-05-26 18:49:24
so does this mean panic sell or panic buy? or both at once?
@_date: 2013-05-26 06:01:38
actually i want to bet that the market will be higher then 130 in a week or 2 weeks or more ect.
it seems to me i can make more profit with this site, then holding AM shares, and with much less risk involved,
if so maybe i should sell my AM shares and just deposit my BTC into here, and lend it, and watch it grow every week.
am i missing something?

yeah the .2% per day was like 70% apyr plus u can count daily compound interest, looks like a good rate for minimal risk, but considering its bitcoins, and we are all hoping bitcoins will rise in price in the year, hopefully it would rise more then 70% which would make just holding the bitcoins a better investment.
or if asicminer continues to do good, continues to own a good amount of hash% continues to sell products and add to dividends, and price of the stock continues to slowly rise, then would still be a better investment to just keep the asicminer shares,
but i guess if no btc or asicminer and just usd, this does seem like a pretty good rate.

ok so lets say i have 20 btc, and i lend it for 1 day or 2 days or even 1 week, how much total will i get in btc back? in 1day-1week?
any exact number?
where can i see this,
and in this 1day or 1week will i be able to easily withdraw more btc then i deposited?
thanks for this! it looks promising, but it sounds like too good to be true... maybe im missing a risk factor here?

read op i already have direct shares from asic, and i bought them when they were cheaper so my initial investment went up already, i can sell them and get more btc then i payed for them. im looking for other ways to make more btc with the btc i already have.
and this bitfinex looks like a good deal what i was looking for
@_date: 2013-05-26 05:13:47
i mean is there any shares that i can buy, that i can make some profit in a week, and then sell them back, or maybe sell them back in a month with some profit? or maybe shares that have dividends everyday, and i can sell them back in a few days with a profit?
any ideas?
@_date: 2013-05-26 07:42:22
i see my math is wrong.
so with $15000 i would make $30 a day and $210 a week at .2%perday still not bad, thats about almost 1,000 a month for doing nothing, just investing 15k
but considering if asicminer shares go up or btc value goes up i would make more money just holding the shares or btc then lending them. i guess this system isnt as good as i thought because of wrong math lol
@_date: 2013-05-26 04:38:13
so what you think about bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-05-26 07:54:43
wow lol still wrong thanks, but i think for usd it was .2% and for btc it was .02%, anyways still doesnt seem worth it
@_date: 2013-05-26 06:17:42
im confused, if i lend 20 btc, and you saying im getting back .02% every day, thats .4 btc profit from lending per day, for 7 days that 2.8 btc profit for the week without including compound interest, now from the 2.8 profit how much goes to bitfinex?
and is this real? if i give them 20 btc in a week they give me back 22.8? or even 21 for sure?
if so then this seems like incredible deal and really too good to be true...

if you know their addresses you can still bet with the client,
also i would use coinroll.it its easier faster and doesnt spam the blochain,
just my 2satoshis
@_date: 2013-05-26 22:52:54
check out bitfinex, looks like you can use them to trade amongst other exchanges all inside there exchange,
they also have other features like margin trading and lending as well,
also they seem pretty secure...

i dont want to bet against the market going up or down, i just want to give bitcoins or usd and get back more in a day, and repeat over and over to get more.
 .02% a day seems good
ps this seems like if i lend 20btc at the end of the week i get 23 back...
thats an extra $300+ dollars per week... how is this possible with no risk involved? i must be missing something
@_date: 2013-05-27 02:36:51
im not complaining, and i dont mind reducing the blocksize, the system is good how it works, i already like it, i just gave an alternative to SD,
im not hating on SD i actually won like 50 bitcoins from SD bymistake, i just found coinroll.it to be easier, and bypasses all the transactions u need to do with SD also you must wait with SD to see your result, and sometimes the result seems like you lost, but later it will give you even more because actually you won just took take for the transaction to show up,
