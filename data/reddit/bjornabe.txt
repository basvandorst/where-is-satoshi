need someone to write up a proper scenario model :)

Unfortunately the young programmers nowadays have never worked a proper job, get paid better than most of their peers even if they are mediocre and get cotton wool treatment from employers because they are so sparse.
Not the best place to learn responsibility.

If you were offering USD on margin you may have lost it.  This is due to the person lending the USD not being able to pay you back it they bought BTC that has been stolen.
Only NON MARGIN OFFERED USD IS SAFE

See this scenario : 
@_date: 2016-08-03 12:07:39
Here is the scenario
Alice has USD.
She lends this to Bob (USD margin offer).
Bob now buys BTC from Ulrika using Alice's USD (margin buy).
So after the hack ------------
Bob owes Alice USD.
Bob has had BTC stolen.
Bob cant pay back Alice.
Ulrika as USD.
