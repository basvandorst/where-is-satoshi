I generalized [countries which imposed banking bans]( in with those where it is outright illegal. In retrospect though, it is too much of a simplification and can come across as misleading; my apologies about that!

As for an update on my [previous post]( I've developed these relationship displays available [here]( but am not happy with how they look and the information they present (I think the information on nodes is wrong; the first image is what I had in mind- second one is the simplified version I intended to use after requesting critique from 8 peers and having every one of them tune out for it being too complicated, needless to say I need to go back to the drawing board with this one.).

I wanted to clarify- you mean the 1, 2, 3, 6, 8+4, 5, 7, 9 order is correct and what I have on right now isn't? I'm a bit confused on which one you're referencing is right and just wanted to confirm it before I make the readjustment in a few hours.

I'd like to thank 
1. my design group who gave me feedback and helped me iterate on the infographics look and feel over the past few weeks, 
2. CoinHills who generously provided me with a breakdown of the volume of bitcoin traded by currency over a year that helped me prepare the central world display and help visualize geospatial variations in bitcoin use in what has formed arguably the center piece of my work, and 
3. I'd also like to give a shout-out to the following users who helped me refine the information on my infographic or direct towards me sources which helped me create some of the relationship displays- u/JeremyBF u/pepe_le_shoe u/NazPirator u/RauberF u/tomdon88 u/josiahromoser u/JonathanSilverblood u/TheGreatMuffin u/Bitcoin_Acolyte u/324JL u/butwhyb

How so?

I never said they shut down, but rather were hacked in 2011. Just lookup Mt. Gox hack 2011 on Google.
@_date: 2018-06-01 04:26:29
That doesn't invalidate my information though nor make my "mtgox hack history is wrong"- I'm sorry that you were affected and lost your money, though. :(

Well- you can go ahead and take your complaints to the people who developed Tableau- I'm sure they would love to learn from your thought-provoking insights :)

I acknowledge that the circular graph, coupled with the labels inside the wreaths aren't easy to read, but did so to make them look visually appealing. It was a tradeoff I was forced to make, but settled with it since everyone I tested the graphic with the giant circle is was what drew them in. Thanks for the feedback though; I appreciate it and will keep that in mind when developing future infographics! 
The map was made using Tableau; everything else, including the graph, was done through Illustrator.

I've rechained my infographic such that after Alice broadcasts she wants to send Bob bitcoins, miners incorporate theirs and several other peoples unconfirmed transactions into a block; where does running it through the cryptographic hash fit into this though?

Thank you all for all the feedback on my previous iteration found [here]( I've updated it using your comments and shared resources to what's linked above, and I'd love to hear any further feedback on how it can be improved; if you notice anything wrong in the information- please point it out too!
A little more about this project- I'm creating an infographic to help people understand bitcoins- how they came to be, major events that have shaped it to what it is now, and just how its value has changed over time. The other components of the infographic are underway, but I want to nail down on the descriptive aspect of explaining the backend of how bitcoin works absolutely correctly. Thanks so much for taking the time to read this; I look forward to your feedback!

I've iterated on the feedback and linked resources from my [previous two submissions]( to develop the above mockup. I'd love to hear any further feedback on how it can be improved; if you notice anything wrong in the information- please point it out too!

I'll remove the text referencing blockchain incorrectly; as for the invalid transaction- I was trying to communicate that if a block without Alice and Bob's transaction T is processed, T is still unconfirmed and will trying allocating itself again within a new block. I understand now that what's on there is incorrect and will change that- but is this understanding right on what happens with transaction T if the block it is in is not added to the network? 
Once these two nodes are fixed (blockchain reference &amp; unconfirmed transactions)- is this error free? Also- thanks for taking the time to reply! 
@_date: 2018-04-24 15:11:24
I've created a new mockup reflecting this change-   
@_date: 2018-04-24 10:02:22
Thanks for pointing that out! I was basing that off [this article here]( but looking at it- I may have misunderstood what a node does- I'll be sure to change it to reflect that nodes ensure the unconfirmed transactions are valid!
@_date: 2018-04-24 06:52:52
I'm making an infographic on how bitcoin works and after reading articles and watching a few videos, this is what I've come up with in regards to how transactions are processed and bitcoins created. 
I would love to iron out anything I may have misunderstood, and would feedback on what I can add or change to better inform people about this topic. Thanks for reading!
@_date: 2018-04-24 07:33:19
Thanks for pointing that out; I'll change the node and blockchain text to reflect that. I'm going through that video now; while it is too technical to use for what I'm creating, it's a pretty cool resource and one I will definitely use for future projects; thanks for sharing!
@_date: 2018-04-24 09:47:30
I've incorporated your feedback into creating this updated mockup on the components of the infographic- 
@_date: 2018-04-24 08:02:02
Awesome, I'll update that information moving forward; thanks for taking the time to point those issues out!

Edit- I've created a new mockup here-

I've just watched the entire video- it was really amazing, especially the tailhalf that discussed mining. I'll definitely try incorporating that information into the graphic, thanks for taking the time to share that resource!
