Both could fail, sure. Or, one could fail due to lack of adoption in the real world and the other one will flourish.

It's been almost a decade and there is no solution yet. What is one more year going to do, when people have no urgent incentive to work together? As we see with collective bargaining agreements, nothing really comes together until you're on the eve of destruction. Until then it's one big game of chicken. Again... I don't know that I entirely agree with this approach, as I think delaying the decision by two years would have allowed Bitcoin to gain a much stronger foothold, but that bird has flown. Bitcoin Cash, Ripple, etc are now legitimately vying to take over the cryptocurrency market and obtain wide adoption, and frankly I can't blame people that choose that side.
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:37:01
The idea is to use this mempool/fee crunch to pressure everybody into adopting an off-chain solution. And after that's in place, I can easily see the block size increasing to 2MB or 4MB. But if that block size increase happens now, there will be no consensus on how to implement off-chain scaling until we hit a crisis like this again. Now, I don't necessarily agree with that position, but it seems to be the mindset of the developers. The major problem is that Bitcoin loses ground to competing altcoins that currently have much lower fees, even if they will run into the same scaling problems down the line. If Bitcoin had snuffed out all major competition and gotten wide adoption FIRST then this wouldn't have been an issue. As it is, it's far too easy for BCH, XRP, etc to claw back some of the market. Bitcoin is not ubiquitous yet, although it is indeed much more popular than before. But if a significant segment of the population had become accustomed to actually suing Bitcoin on a regular basis, then you have a lot of people pressuring it to figure out an off-chain solution.
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:44:22
Yup, and now people will be leaving Coinbase/GDAX for other exchanges. Trust is easy to lose and nearly impossible to regain.

[This imminent existential crisis]( is not something Bitcoin has faced before. Especially not with so many viable alternatives picking up a lot of steam.

It is not a strawman, it is unusable for almost anybody. $40+ for a transaction is pointless for almost everybody.

@_date: 2017-12-27 14:10:00
They are huge issues. Bitcoin is unusable as a payment system for 99% of people who know about it and actively want to use it. And that is unlikely to change in 2018. People can deride hard forks all they want as being imperfect, but they are usable and solving solutions. You can only ride the momentum of being the first mover for so long before better implementations overtake it.
@_date: 2017-12-27 19:40:24


The average transaction fee over the past week has never dropped below $40. Some pay more, some pay less. You can pay less if you want to take the risk of your transaction sitting in the mempool for days or weeks, but that's not really a viable solution for most people.
Obviously people are still using Bitcoin, and it still has inertia from being the first mover. When Bitcoin was worth next to nothing, that didn't mean it was a failure long-term. Conversely, being worth $16K or whatever it is, doesn't mean it is viable long-term. Blockbuster was still the volume-leader in movie rentals long after it's business model was made obsolete.
Something has to change in a big way for Bitcoin to maintain the lead in market cap. It could happen; LN might actually work within 6 months, who knows?? If you have to beg centralized corporations to adopt it, then I don't think it will work, but anything is possible. Ripple is not far away from surpassing Bitcoin, and it is ready to scale immediately. Say what you want about it not being decentralized, or it's run by banks, or whatever. In 6 months you might sound like somebody extolling the virtues of the Microsoft Zune; hardcore users might think it's perfect but if nobody else does, it will die. It won't take much more than a couple months of $40+ transactions to bring adoption to a complete stop. Sure, people who have it will move it around, and a ton of transactions are from people who are sending it for free through GDAX or people who just don't know any better and are learning how the fees work. It's not from people spending it on things, though. And without that segment of the market, it will die. There will be no reason to use Bitcoin as a store of value if the currency people use for day to day transactions can perform the same function.
@_date: 2017-12-19 17:00:43
Or it would just delay the problem until a year or two from now, and we'd be in the same position. I don't know for sure, but I would think the pressure from rising fees fast tracks adoption of LN. If you think it's bad now, imagine how bad it'd be if transactions were cheap. The average Joe would care even less about shifting to Segwit/LN. Honestly, I don't think decentralization would be that bad at 2MB or even 4MB block sizes. The problem is going the easy route every time the blocks fill up. It's like Apple removing the headphone jack. Painful at first, but it fastracks new technologies.
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:49:46


So, is the only issue you have with my comment the fact that you don't understand what the word "average" means??
And what does Ripple do better? It moves money from one person to another, immediately, at scale, for extremely cheap fees. I don't even have any XRP, but it's hard to deny that as-is, it is much more useful as a currency. BCash is also extremely cheap but it won't scale as well as Ripple.

Who was talking about feelings?? Yes, they'll keep the noob customers, but their reputation took a big hit with a significant portion of their community. Reputation is a valuable thing, long-term.

Where do you estimate will Bitcoin rank in market cap amongst cryptocurrencies when LN goes live??
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:42:33
Maybe not illegal (although it might be) but it definitely has destroyed their reputation.

Just as reliable as the fact that they'll steadily deflate the value of the USD.

You're assuming, of course, that you're on the right side of the drama. You're hysterically screaming and attacking ad hominem, everybody that says anything that goes against the company line. I hold Bitcoin, I'm legitimately worried about it's viability long-term because it's encountering a major issue that threatens to end it's adoption, and you're screaming at me calling me BCash scum. You are a puppet!!
@_date: 2017-12-27 17:12:08
Every single comment doesn't need to have the entire history of Bitcoin's technological issues included as an addendum. If you don't understand why this is a huge problem that is not on schedule to be fixed (SegWit alone will not solve the problem), then you're not paying attention.
My only agenda is making Bitcoin viable long-term. I hold Bitcoin, I want it to work. Its not working, it's failing at a crucial time in which there are a lot of viable alternatives.
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:21:42
They could have murdered a group of toddlers and still would have gained respect from Cash supporters in response to listing BCH on the exchange. The way they went about listing it, and the blatant insider trading that went on, will deservedly cause them to lose a lot of support from a huge portion of the Bitcoin community that they easily could have retained by making a proper announcement ahead of time. Whether it was incompetence or malice doesn't really make a difference.
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:56:45
Oh there is definitely no extra push needed. Bitcoin could collapse within months at the rate we're going. And not just a dip. $40 fees, and it only keeps rising. Elizabeth Stark better give a REALLY fucking convincing interview on LN implementation this afternoon on Bloomberg if Bitcoin's reputation is to be salvaged.
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:24:21
The panic stems from the fact that Bitcoin's biggest competitor went from having 10% of BTC's market cap up to 25% in the span of a few hours. That has happened before, in November, but at that time average BTC tx fee was $5. This time, it's $30, with no solution to that problem in sight for the foreseeable future. This is new. It's not the same as previous dips. I'm still holding for now until this whole mess shakes out, but there is definitely cause to be concerned.
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:54:04

Hate to break it to you, but if LTC becomes adopted for the majority of the population, there will be no reason not to also use it as a store of value. If people don't use Bitcoin, it will die. It's simple.

It's not going to replace the currency for every single person in the world. USD is the defacto global currency right now. The fact that the supply is so much bigger than the USD means that it's a non-issue.
@_date: 2018-10-31 12:53:21
No idea. But I am 99.9999% certain that supply will never be a factor in my lifetime. Even then, all it stops is tiny transactions. It will always be viable as digital gold, which is where it's real value comes into play IMO.
@_date: 2018-10-29 18:28:02
This potential problem is so far into the future that it will have been solved a hundred times over by the time it matters. It's extremely unlikely that Bitcoin is a ubiquitous world currency, anyway. At best it'll be digital gold. There'll be some other way off-chain to perform transactions for every day items.

He said that's what it's be worth of the household wealth of the entire world was stored in Bitcoin. I can calculate the value of an ounce of gold if everybody on Earth converted their wealth into bullion, but that doesn't mean I'm bullish on gold.

@_date: 2019-10-27 16:57:00
You could say the same thing about literally every single stock or shitcoin that has massively shot up in value for any period of time. That's why I compared it to penny stocks. It's a gamble, for sure. Whether it'll work out over any random pairing of arbitrary endpoints is a coin toss. Telling me what was a good decision 5 years ago has no bearing on if it's a good decision in October 2019. Anybody who seriously thinks that "the halvening" will cause an increase in value that is not taken into account by the price, should not be making significant financial decisions.
@_date: 2019-10-27 16:55:24
I don't have the audacity to believe that what I "think" it'll be worth means anything.
@_date: 2019-10-27 15:33:28

That's great that you want to be reckless with your money. Encouraging other people to use Bitcoin as a savings account is such a terrible idea that I will point out how stupid a decision it is whenever somebody asks. It's nothing more than gambling, and people should be aware of that.
@_date: 2019-10-27 14:53:30
Nobody here will tell you the truth, but it's incredibly risky and almost certainly a terrible idea. There are many established methods to determine your risk tolerance, and putting your savings into Bitcoin is a step or two more risky than buying random penny stocks. It's a terrible idea if you'll need the money within the next 5 years.
The fact you think that "the next halvening" is a reason to invest shows how clueless you are about how investments work. The fact that the halvening is happening isn't a secret, therefore it's built into the price. Do yourself a favour and only keep as much money in Bitcoin as you'd be comfortable betting on a hand of blackjack.

You're sure doing it a lot for somebody who hates it. I don't care about Bitcoin not being the global currency. It's pretty simple.


It will never - and arguably never possibly could - happen. Like I said, if we're gonna complain about a guy giving out money for Hallowe'en as ruining this robust global currency, the argument for it is kind of already over before it even starts. I personally don't even think it'll be a supply issue that prevents it.
