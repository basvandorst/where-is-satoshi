yes it will. there are many cases where redditors complained about exchanges and they got the issue fixed. 
A guy has no idea where his $1.8 million is and do you think He'a able to chill out? I would freak out
@_date: 2017-12-26 18:13:50
i have a trezor but considering buying a ledger nano s, since it support more coins
@_date: 2017-12-25 19:03:24
that's more than 90% of redditors have
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:07:31
He has a corporate account
@_date: 2017-12-11 00:07:07
@_date: 2017-12-11 00:01:41
transfer btc amount on gdax and sell from there.
if you don't know how to do it, search on this subreddit
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:39:29
this may work for you and may not work for other people. 
i believe that if you have a small amount invested, you may not have to sell it and use it as currency in the future. However if the amount is considerable, it would be better to cash out a small percentage each year. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:07:43
He has a corporate account
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:33:43
maybe He already did that. I don't get why people get so mad for this kind of issues. The guy has a transaction stuck into the exchange and is warning the community about that. Probably He will get help from Bitstamp, since the post is getting relevant. And we have an idea about what is going on with exchanges. 
To deposit money, yeah man no problem. To withdraw, there are always so many fucking issues.
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:36:01
Iota released their new wallet today. Better them nothing
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:59:34
what would you suggest?
@_date: 2018-09-02 21:55:18
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:55:21
In Italy as well. Evening news talk weekly about btc. This is getting mainstream
@_date: 2017-12-11 00:05:43
yeah this is a stupid question
is faster for you to google it then open a new thread about it
@_date: 2018-08-26 16:07:45
just use coinbase pro and you will be good
@_date: 2017-11-18 00:50:36
Square is becoming a great company. I am a big fan since the beginning, but wasn't able to implement their software in my business because I'm not in the USA. That sucked. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 00:48:07
on the weekend you cannot transfer money to exchanges to buy bitcoin! I tried to buy the last weekend but money got available only on Monday evening. I'm a whale haha
@_date: 2017-11-02 22:25:15
i needed this
@_date: 2017-11-15 22:00:36
thank you for answering. I get your point but i still believe that this is good news for the Bitcoin movement. Is note huge as someone says but is something. Wish you a good day
@_date: 2017-11-09 23:36:15
I get you point but i believe that before investing whichever amount of money you should do your own research and you will easily find which is the best way to buy.
Indeed they are the same company but coinbase is clean and simple to use, let's say is for 90% of BTC new buyers. Gdax is more complex and can scary people away. Let's say is for buyers with experience. 
If you are coinbase, wouldn't you charge those fees? They got 100k new users the other day, they don't give a sh*t if you believe the fee is to high. There are thousand of people every hour that buy from there
@_date: 2017-11-04 21:52:46
OK. Yeah I thought not many people will pay you in btc but you are raising awerness and that is great. I'm thinking on doing the same in my place
@_date: 2017-11-19 10:15:59
I bought my trezor from amazon without issues. Just make sure the seller has feedbacks and the package is in not already open. In case contact the producer from their website
@_date: 2017-11-04 18:26:08
absolutely i agree with you. I was just thinking since the company bank account is under my name that wouldn't be an issue.
Thanks for your advice
@_date: 2017-11-01 23:03:24
so if I put them in my electrum wallet, would be a better idea?
@_date: 2017-11-19 16:23:40
Yes. But still,  I would prefer to buy it from a seller tha  has many positive feedbacks. Even tho it will cost you 10/20 bucks more. With this kind of investment,  trying to save a couple of bucks is not worth it. You may lose all you BTC. My advice is be safe and check the package. Has to be sealed perfectly. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 18:46:41
make a sepa deposit on gdax and buy form there. no fees
@_date: 2017-11-15 21:33:03
fuck them for supporting Bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-11-08 00:39:30
RemindMe! 12 days
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:27:17
good. I just bought a trezor through amazon and is on his way. Can't wait to lock my 1BTC in it.
I promise myself to don't check the price every 5 minutes lol
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:43:34
you just need to have your seed phrase and you can recover your wallet if the trezor break or you lose it.
you can check here:
@_date: 2017-11-07 21:40:12
How do we read the article? Why would you post an article if is not free to read? Wtf
@_date: 2017-11-15 21:50:16
don't be a dick, please
@_date: 2017-11-13 00:34:50
nobody knows. But I believe that cannot possible go up during the weekends in general because you cannot transfer money to the exchange, so people cannot buy. This is a problem I personally have and maybe many others are in the same situation.
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:35:35
even the bad one?
@_date: 2017-11-14 10:11:05
Gemini and CB are exchanges. Nothing ti do with the BTC network
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:42:02
waiting for 10k
@_date: 2017-11-24 01:47:23
the tangle by Iota is already getting interesting
@_date: 2017-11-14 02:17:24
I now that. I had some extra coins on CB and was excited to show him how it works.
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:05:23
thank you for this.
I'm loving it. simple and clear
@_date: 2017-11-14 02:42:07
that was the hard fork
@_date: 2017-11-08 00:55:07
hopefully it will go down to 3-4k so i will be able to afford 3 bitcoins in total. after that will hodl forever. If in 10-15 years the investment will payoff I will be a genius and will have some serious money. otherwise i'm losing 50% of my savings. I'm young tho, with a stable job, so this is not a big deal for me
@_date: 2017-11-11 00:40:14
I bought 2BTC just two days ago. 
This is my first time and i'm losing a considerable amount of money.  Not worried tho.  Thing will be better.  
Give me your address and will send you 5 bucks cause I don't want to see you sad
@_date: 2017-11-14 02:15:22
Since my comment has been made a post on r/btc, saying that i deceived my friend not telling him about the transfer fee and saying that r/Bitcoin users are liars, I jus wanted to say that I didn't tell him because he would have felt bad for me and would have insisted on giving me back the fee. I explained to him that at this moment in time fees are very high and is not profitable to move coins around.
EDIT: spelling
@_date: 2017-11-13 23:45:57
I'm subscribed here and own BTC. But sometimes i surf their subreddit and they are right about how people get banned in this subreddit for no reason. 
Moderators of both subreddits are pushing their own agenda, I believe.
@_date: 2017-11-09 09:30:40
1 BTC is 7k so forget about it
@_date: 2017-11-04 18:22:34
I just got into bitcoins and the first thing i thought was about doing the same. I have a staff of 10 people and will do give them a fraction of BTC each and set them up a paper wallet. will see if they will thank me in 5 years.
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:02:01
try AdBlock. It will change your life
@_date: 2017-11-12 02:41:10
bought a considerable amount at 7500. I'm shitting my pants right now.
But I learnt that is better to buy everyday a small amount instead of going all in.
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:01:44
i had 5k ready to invest after the fork... that was my prediction. guess will invest them at the current rate. will wait tomorrow tho
@_date: 2017-11-18 00:31:10
good for you man!!
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:29:14
i know that, but I had some balance on CB and and He just set up his electrum wallet, so wanted to show him how it works.
ps. my comment has been published on r/btc and they omitted that I said that this fee is ridiculous. Showing only one side of the story
@_date: 2017-11-08 13:54:35
good to hear that. Hopefully you can get something out of it. Thanks for helping the community with your work.
I just started with Bitcoin and I got really involved in it. Economically and emotionally. I truly believe that our generation is doing something great for the rest of the world. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 00:29:44
I did the same. Went all in at ATH and now will be buy again tomorrow. You are not alone
@_date: 2017-11-08 13:08:42
this would be my dream
@_date: 2017-11-11 00:50:04
As you wish. Don't worry too mich about the daily swings. I'm the long run you will be a winner. We will be. Hopefully ahaha
@_date: 2017-11-02 20:36:33
I don't care honestly. Just want to get in
@_date: 2017-11-02 22:29:59
plot twist. you are your friend and want the community to convince you
@_date: 2017-11-14 02:19:25
Should I stay out of bitcoin because has high transfer fees?
Sorry but this is not why im into BTC. 
BCash is crap
@_date: 2017-11-15 21:43:21
hundreds is better then zero. this is good news for all the movement
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:50:28
thanks. this is even better
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:30:28
well. that sucks
just discovered  from a comment on this thread. I'm trying it without adblock to see if there are many ads, but it seems very clean to me. maybe you should check it
@_date: 2017-11-15 22:04:56
I panicked because i went all in at ATH. Feel better now and we we suffer other dips in the near future will not care so much, probably will buy more if I can afford it.
@_date: 2017-11-08 00:13:03
this means that you haven't bought anything...
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:34:39
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:59:46
RemindMe! 3 weeks
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:03:45
exactly! if we can have a +10% yearly it would turn as an amazing investment for most of us.
I sometimes dream the moon but is just a dream. Would be happy with a constant and slowly raise
@_date: 2017-11-08 00:23:41
better to buy from gdax.com. but have to make a sepa transfer and in 2 business days you are ready to go. you will not pay fees that coinbase charge you. they are the same company
@_date: 2017-11-04 21:28:58
How dies this works?  Do you have a phone with the wallet always at the store to make sure you receive the payments or the customers show you that the payment has been sent?  
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:24:18
so you are saying that it may hit 10k or it may not....
however, it would be great to have a starting point like 10k for the upcoming year. I bought 1BTC at 7K and i'm looking for a long term investment; those daily ups and down don't really bother me. Actually they do cause i keep checking the price every 5 minutes lol. But i like to thing that it doesn't really bother me. If in 5 years we hit 100k I would be the happiest man. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 23:11:43
would be nice the auto-refresh
@_date: 2017-11-13 23:21:31
and on the r/Btc there is a post that claims many people are banned from this subreddit.
I don't know which community is better at this point
@_date: 2017-11-12 02:49:21
i transferred my BTCs on the trezor and I'm not gonna touch them for some years. The fluctuation is interesting to follow but i'm not so worried. I believe in BTC in the long run.
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:51:46
They got lucky or what?
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:37:08
i feel more secure with a hard wallet and made my researches and in the end settled for the trezor. I'm not sure if one is better than the other one. I just know that they are better than paper wallets and i like the idea of having something I can touch and knowing that my money are safe in my hands
@_date: 2017-11-19 16:16:23
Is not cost prohibitive. You don't have to buy a whole Btc just a fraction of it
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:44:10
let's hit a stable 8k first
@_date: 2017-11-02 20:23:34
what is the 21 club?
@_date: 2017-11-01 22:54:33
i don't get it. is there a real possibility of loosing everything if i leave my BTC on Coinbase? 
@_date: 2017-11-08 00:45:51
i just bought $7000 in bitcoin and will buy another $7000 if the price will drop after the fork. just curious 
@_date: 2017-11-08 13:09:49
is your life bitcoin-centric? genuine question
@_date: 2017-11-19 12:20:27
GIF is nice bit what he's saying is correct
@_date: 2017-11-14 02:11:58
not much. In this week there are many tx so the fees are high.
@_date: 2017-11-13 21:46:15
i would buy one
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:33:04
i transferred $2 to my friend's new wallet. just to show him how it works. I got $10 in fees.... I didn't tell him. 
The transfer was made from my Coinbase account and not from my wallet, but still, this is ridiculous 
@_date: 2017-11-01 23:06:35
thank you!
@_date: 2017-11-02 21:30:45
@_date: 2017-11-14 00:01:33
dear r/Bitcoin, I choose You!
@_date: 2017-11-01 22:59:03
yeah genius. this is the place people come to ask advice to other people in the same situation. you never asked for advice?
@_date: 2017-11-09 23:24:15
somebody already explained to you that you need to transfer your money to gdax and buy from there without fee. 
You are free to use localbitcoins or other services, no need to comment 4 times on your own post stating the same thing. We get it
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:33:43
On gdax id you do a SEPA transfer you play zero fees
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:45:10
so I guess He's not getting back his money
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:26:55
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:30:59
i didn't get it and now i don't care muhahaha
@_date: 2017-11-15 21:29:12
im not gonna be silent. I bought at $7800 and yesterday I missed the dip. Bought agai at $7100.
I don't care too much honestly. I believe the price will skyrocket in the next years, so better to invest now at whatever price
@_date: 2017-11-15 21:41:47
Square implementing Bitcoin is a good news. People on CNBC reacting positively is a good news as well. The price goes up and Square's stocks went up as well. More companies will start approaching bitcoin and more people will know and will start using/investing or whatever they want to do with it. 
Price goes up and we are all happy. Don't you agree?
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:05:32
Ahah. I really wanted you to finger your ass. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 16:03:49

@_date: 2017-11-08 18:31:35
My SEPA transfers take 2 days max
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:35:46
actually we both see Bitcoin as a long time investment and don't want do spend it to buy coffee, so I don't really care about the fees. If they will be able the address this problem in the near future, good for all of us.
I know that BCH has lower fees, but since i'm investing MY money, I choose where to put them
@_date: 2017-11-12 02:54:40
thank you for the advice. I appreciate
@_date: 2017-11-09 09:32:37
On coinbase/gdax you can choose you type of account,  personal or corporate. 
You can do the same with Kraken. 
However have to wait a lot before receiving confermation

upvote the post to reach more people possible
@_date: 2017-10-31 21:42:14
Even better. I prefer to have something physical like a Trezor. 
Still have to buy through gdax and transfer to the adress the trezor give me; right?
@_date: 2017-10-31 21:36:45
I will download Electrum. Is the only one I heard in those days searching online for information about bitcoin. 
So I will buy the bitcoin on gdax and the transfer it on Electrum. 
thaks for your help

Delivery is crazy expensive
@_date: 2017-10-31 15:22:24
i believe those are the rates. but still:
USPS Priority Mail Int'l (6-10 business days after fulfillment):
If I want to buy a pillow for $30, have to spend $46 to have it in 10 business days + fulfilment.... don't you agree that is expensive?
@_date: 2017-10-31 21:30:14
what is an alpha wallet and why i shouldn't use it? if you don't mind answering.
Gdax is the same company of coinbase if i'm correct. So i don't have to open another account. is that right?
