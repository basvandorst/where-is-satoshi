For this type of format it is. If you have JPEG really high quality and comprised from the original compare it to a PNG quality will look the same. Until you look at the file size and realize that JPEG did a horrible job of compressing your illustrations. 
JPEG (only due to lack of compatibility of superior formats) is probably your best choice for compressing photographs and anything with lots of gradients. However for a flat illustration a PNG will provide you with far superior compression (if settings are optimized)  the file will be a lot smaller than a JPEG of the same visual quality. If you try and compress the JPEG to be the same size as the PNG (you always want a small size online) the JPEG will have a huge amount of artifacts. However the PNG won't and will be clear as day.

Nope horrible for photographs too. JPEG 2000 (JP2) is tremendously better than JPEG (a horrendously old outdated compression format/technique).
Just that unlike video when you  getting twice the quality for the same file size has lead to broad adoption of modern compression techniques because a  10 GB file only needing to be 5 GB is a huge plus. People haven't cared enough about turning a 1MB image into 0.5MB and same quality so better formats never really caught in and we're only using JPEGs today because everything supports them. Even though it's an outdated format from 1992...

Is there really anything that asserts that this means they couldn't use cold storage? Like, how is delivering funds form a hot wallet and periodically refilling that hot wallet with cold storage prohibit a company from delivering bitcoins? It doesn't. 
Is there any legal precedence to show that this would prevent a business from using cold storage because right now we're just taking your word for it. Your source also doesn't say anything about how Bitfinex didn't use cold storage because of this, it's claiming that they didn't fallow the required regulation and as such were in violation of the law.

Do we have any details about how the hack occurred. I haven't done enough reading on the issue but I'm under the impression this post sums up exactly what happened. If Bitfinex's server is compromised and the system is setup in such a way that their server merely needs to ask Bitgo to sign the request then Bitgo will do so without verifying (or being fooled into thinking) that the withdrawal is legitimate and then sign the transaction anyways. Therefore negating the benefit of even using multi sig. You need to have a strict set of rules both parties must agree to to approve a transaction to prevent such an act form occurring.

Andreas made a good point about how LN disincentivizes centralization because you need to have the private keys on a running node to operate a payment hub. You won't see some huge centralized payment hubs start appearing as then they'll be big targets for hackers and there's no cold storage in a payment hub. So there is a financial incentive (through risk mitigation) not to allow for a payment hub to be beyond a certain size.

To open a channel you send to send funds to a 2 of 2 multi signs address of which you have one of the keys too and the other hub has the other key too. Thud is what makes the system decentralized and trustless. That requires an onchain transaction, that's what makes it so LN functions. If you already have such a channel open then someone may be able to find a route to it without opening an other channel with you.
Regardless the blockchain is still needed to tie LN to it, otherwise LN would no longer be Bitcoin.

That's how LN works. It's a system of smart contracts. 
Let's say Alice does a lot of transactions with Bob well before LN each transaction went on the blockchain. 
With LN Alice can say I will write a contract to pay Bob $2. Now Bob and Alice keep a copy of this contract. Well Alice does a new transaction with Bob and says I'll pay you an other $2 so let's just cancel that $2 contract and make it a contract that says Alice owes Bob $4. Now they can keep doing this again and again contracts are made to transfer funds with each new contract invalidating the previous and no transfer of funds touch the blockchain but that's important to note no funds have actually been transfers only contracts signed to say they later will be. 
Well now Bob decides he wants his money but Alice doesn't feel like giving it to Bob. Well no problem because Bob has a contract signed by him and Alice to say Alice owes him $4 so he broadcast the contract onchain. The blockchain then acts as a court system by validating and enforcing the contract saying that Alice does owe money to Bob and then takes that money from Alice and gives it to Bob by conducting an onchain transaction updating the state of the ledger. It enforces and validates the contract like a court system.

And be able to accommodate 4x the user base and in the case of LN 4x the amount of payment channels being opened and closed at a given time.
@_date: 2017-12-31 17:11:21
With LN you don't hand you money to anyone rather you enter 2 of 2 multi signs contracts with a payment hub where any movement of funds requires your signature from your private key. 
You might want to learn how LN works first. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 08:46:32
It's a more efficient signature algorithm that is a substitute for ECDSA that is in use today (rather it's a different variant of ECDSA).

Nope not at all because A) LN makes it easier to use multiple blockchains through cross chain atomic swaps and B) Bitcoin has the tiniest blocksize hard cap of any coin at 1 MB so even with LN Bitcoin is severely bottlenecked in the long term and LN will as a result be able to accommodate more users on alts.
@_date: 2017-12-31 09:04:24
You also need to make an onchain transaction in order to open the payment channel. That's what makes the system trustless by you holding one of the keys to a 2 of 2 multi signs address used for a HTLC smart contract. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 08:58:25
Yeah or LTC, or ETH, or XMR, or ETC, or insert every single altcoin  here... 
This isn't a BCH thing it's only BTC that is 1 MB block limit. Why anyon ever adopted BCH over LTC well that part is jsut beyond me. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 07:58:47
It's not really POS since in a POS system stake holders validate blocks. In LN the only similarity it has to POS is that people running payment hubs get to earn interest on coins locked up in those channels. But they don't actually do much of anything to secure the blockchain as that's all done by POW miners which are used to arbitrate in the event of a dispute, POW backs the system entirely. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 08:56:45
It doesn't risk the whole network. 1 MB is so conservative that 8 MB is certaintly viable. Sure 1 MB may lead to a more decentralized backend but the increased utility of say 8MB is worth it. It's also important to note that while greater  node count means greater decentralization if blocks are too small then it discourages people from ever touching the decentralization back end in which case smaller blocks can actually lead to centralization. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 08:53:17
It's important to note that to use bidirectional payment channels a transaction malleability fix is needed of which Segwit does. If we're taking BCH it is a anti Segwit and doesn't have a TX malibality fix so only unidirectional payment channels can be done as I understand it. LTC is the solution with bigger effective block size, the second layer solutions and faster block times being the icing in the cake. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 09:09:35
But will we ever be able to go there when it's needed if we don't go there now? The more and more used and wide spread Bitcoin becomes the more decentralized it becomes  and therefore the harder and harder it becomes to change a hard coded parameter given that near unanimous consensus is needed to do so.  Eventually the network becomes so big that making a change that is necessary becomes impossible. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 09:13:05
It doesn't need bigger blocks to work it just needs bigger blocks to scale to meet world wide demand. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 07:52:49
Until demand increases and then even with LN there'll be more onchain congestion than today.
From the Lightning White paper: 


make 3 blockchain transactions per year on average, Bitcoin will be able
to support over 35 million users with 1MB blocks in ideal circumstances
(assuming 2000 transactions/MB, or 500 bytes/Tx).


micropayment channels, to enable 7 billion people to make two channels
per year with unlimited transactions inside the channel, it would require
133 MB blocks (presuming 500 bytes per transaction and 52560 blocks per
year). 
@_date: 2017-12-31 17:12:14
Indeed. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 17:16:28
Not really. It's not just a question of do we need bigger blocks. It's a question of how big, how is is it implemented, and how do we handle future block size increases? There's hundreds of thousands of different implementations of bigger blocks that could be implemented. Even if we could get broad consensus that a  block size increase is needed gaining consensus on what constitutes that block size increase is much much more difficult. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 09:15:43
If LN isn't P2P then I guess me  sending an onchain transaction to a node that proporgates it through a system of thousands of other nodes and of which a variety of mining pools then go off and validates it themselves to then give a third party like BitPay the ability to validate the transaction and have a merchant conected to them isn't P2P either. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 08:09:57
The blockchain is needed to enforce the security of the offchain transactions. It's what permits offchain transactions to be secure and decentralized by pinning them to funds onchain and using the blockchain to resolve disputes. Without tying off chain transactions cyptographically to the blockchain those offchain transactions wouldn't be decentralized and trustless. 
For people to use Lighitning Network they need to open and eventually close a payment channel. That is done with an onchain transaction to open it and an offchain transaction to close the channel. Within that channel a near unlimited amount of transactions can occur before the channel expires. Basically Lighiting lets you batch up several offchian transactions into two onchain transactions by only settling the net sum of those transactions onchian.

Lightning is only in Alpha now though the next LND release will be Beta. Now we're talking about money here so this is mission critical infrastructure. So yep could take some time.

Even the way it is currently is shady. Dash is a system ruled by oligarchs. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 08:28:50
Not quite. They need to open a payment channel with you or find a route to a payment channel you already have open.
That is unless you want to trust a third party like Xapo to hold your coins for you of whom the exchange may already have a payment channel open with but we want to avoid trust so that's a bad idea, you'd want to have your own channel open with the exchange just like how you'd want to hold your own Bitcoin on your own set of private keys.
What this means though is that once you have a channel open with an exchange they can send all subsequent transactions through that channel to you. So if you often move funds in an out of an exchange instead of being dozens or hundreds of onchain transactions you only have two onchain transactions and all transactions between you and that exchange are batched up as the net sum is settled onchian and everything inbetween is with Lightining.
The great thing about Lightining though is that the exchange doesn't actually need to have a payment channel open with you since if you already have a payment channel open with someone else they could route the funds through that channel to you.
So for example let's say you bought Bitcoin on Coinbase. Well now let's also say you often buy things on Overstock and so you have a payment channel open with Overstock. Well Coinbase could then route your payment through Overstock to you therefore paying you without having to establish any payment channel with you. 
The way this works on the back end is that Coinbase basically says all those funds you paid to Overstock, well you get them back and get to keep them and we'll just pay Overstock those funds. To you it seems like you paid Overstock and then bought more Bitcoin, to Overstock it looks that way to. But to the blockchain it sees less transactions and views it as Coinbase paying Overstock and you not making any transaction at all.
@_date: 2017-12-31 09:11:57
LND, Eclair, and lightning-c are vaporware? Really because it looks like a lot of code to me. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 09:03:15
You need to open and close payment channels onchain and use the blockchain in the event of a dispute. LN is more akin to batching up several offchain transactions into two onchain transactions where only the net sum is settled onchain, this vastly increases efficiency and privacy.
But you can't have everything on LN as the contracts/IOUs on LN only have value and backing because of what they represent onchain and because of their onchain redeemable properties.
So no not all transactions will be done on LN because in order to do  LN transaction users need to make a limited amount of onchain transactions. The larger onchain capacity the larger LN capacity exists. 
@_date: 2015-06-04 19:33:33
Yes they can. But there should still be a hard cap so that miners can't decide to spam the blockchain if they want. Or what if a mining pool gets hacked? 
@_date: 2015-06-21 17:13:22
@_date: 2017-12-29 07:56:41
No. Anyone could do this but you can't transact more though a payment channel than the value of all funds in that payment channel. So for million dollar transactions yes big institutions would need to be the ones handling the payment channels. But for a few hundred dollars or even few thousand Joe Shmoe could run a payment hub and handle transactions within those value constrains over it.

That's not what I'm referring to, you have the right to pass things on to family, as should you.
 I'm referring to job opportunities and positions of power, opportunities granted to you simply because of those you know due to a class you where born into. Think how many millionaires have a kid that when they grow older isn't also going to be rich making a large salary? You're advocating for a world that says if you are born into a poor family and you get your leg cut off too bad because socialized medicine is steeling from the rich and that if you where rich and that happened do you'd be okay because you have the wealth. But at the end of the day we are all just people, the value of our lives are equal to one and other and what country/family/class/ethnicity you where born into is just a toss of a coin.
Redistribution of wealth to an extent is about what is good for the greater good of society. Obviously we need some level of income inequality to provide incentive and that some are more deserving of greater wealth than others. But at the same time some are privileged for no good reason. That some guy born to the son of a millionaire would have  a very different life if that same person was born the son of a poor man even. That because you are born into a family doesn't mean you are entitled to that life style. It doesn't mean you are any better than others. We live in a world where the poor are getting poorer and the rich are getting rich. That is a problem and that is not fair. 
Because someone is born into an income class doesn't mean they are entitled to be in that class. Obviously some fortunes are self made, not few actually work their way up the class structure.

Socialism is used in many contexts often not referring to being fully socialist but rather an offering of social services. Socialism is a middle ground between capitalism and communism. While true socialism is opposed to capitalism few things that are refereed to as socialism are actually opposed to capitalism but much rather capitalism with the direction of socialism. 
 Communism is specifically  about the collective ownership of the means of production and pretty much everything. On top of this true communism has nothing to do with government. Communism it's self is stateless and is counter to a ruling class, as such counter to the existent of government. A [Communist state]( is an oxymoron as communism is counter to the existent of the state. [Anarchist communism]( is a thing and falls under the group of ideologies consistent with [libertarian socialism](
When we think of places like Cuba, the USSR where the government owns the means of production as communist these are actually [Marxist–Leninist]( state as they are communist inspired but really it is just government saying they are doing something in the name of communism or with the intention of one day achieving communism and as such have created a political ideology of their own where they practice  [state capitalism.] (
At the end of the day socialism and communism are just principles and from them a wide range of sometimes opposing ideologies is derived.

No one  wants to run an Android full node because no one wants to waist 20 GB of space on their phone to store the blockchain and use greater than 100 GB of bandwidth per month when they have a data cap. 
I'm not sure how you conclude it's hard to set up. All you need to do is download Bitcoin QT and open port 8333 on you firewall and/or router. Sure there's more complicated set up but this easy one works out just fine. 
The more nodes there are the more decentralized Bitcoin is. The more fragmented the network of nodes are the greater enforced rules like 21 million maximum Bitcoin are and there's greater validation of transactions (nodes really check the signatures and verify transactions miners are more about verifying the order of transactions and proving no nodes lied about the order, miners prevent double spending nodes still verify). 
You say most of you funds are in cold storage but if your running  a full node it doesn't mean you are spending Bitcoin or using it, or even own it. It's simply a means of supporting the network and securing it by donating your bandwidth. I don't have any personal incentive to run a full node but I do because I support the idea of Bitcoin and want to foster it's success.

What's their TOS with servers? How could they tell? Would they simply suspect you are running one due to various incoming and outgoing connections? Is it a bandwidth thing? Or simply a port thing (port 8333 isn't a exactly associated with servers). Simply running a VPN and routing your node through it should take care of your problems. They'd see one constant connection to a sever and that's all. It's all encrypted so they don't know what you are doing great and don't know you are running  a node communicating with various peers as the VPN tunnels it all to one server before accessing the wide area network.

It's not too hard to counter this argument. With Bitcoin it does force government to not print money. Which means if services are to be provided government must actual bring in the revenue to pay for it. So this prevents debt and enforces responsible socialism where the books must be balanced. In the end it prevents austerity as austerity is about cutting  things that we couldn't  pay for to start with. So by forcing  the books to be balanced it creates an equilibrium of revenue and spending. If a service can't be paid for it can't be provided. If revenue can be brought in then it can be paid for. It forces socialism with responsibility not delusion.

It's pretty clear that Ross was involved and started it. Really anyone could of suspected that from that start. What led them to him was that he made mention of Silkroad on Shroomery with the user name Altoid. Then made posts on Bitcoin talk under the same name one of which contained his email (RossUlbricht Then the stackexchange posts. Really who DPR was was right there on the clear net in plain site not a single warrant or violation of constitution in order to obtain this. Supposedly DPR even made a post on the silkroad forums when asked about how he promoted it on Shroomery. Then really once he was suspect his OPSEC screwed him even more so. 
So yeah Ross was DPR. The defences saying he was framed by the real DPR seemed like "Fuck it we're loosing this already and got nothing left" attempt. Going ahead however with the possibilities of multiple DPRs at the same time however and using the prosecutions own witness to interject doubt and the possibility of multiple DPRs is smart. But the judge wasn't in their favour to the slightest. Given the anonymous nature of TOR you can't prove that all actions that are done under the persona of DPR are indeed Ross. It's very well possible that you could have Ross saying one thing and Karpels the other. So interjecting reasonable doubt here is what's important and that is enough to at least make the jury question if all things DPR did were indeed Ross. However when you have a judge that says no expert testimony is needed as to how TOR and Bitcoin works (when it's a case about FUCKING BITCOIN AND TOR!) kills the jury's understanding that who DPR was isn't certain. Especially when the FBI it's self had doubt. 
As for the murder things well in the case he was just convicted he wasn't ever changed for murder they were all dropped. There is only one count of murder that he was charged for and that's in the ongoing (maybe never we be heard) case in Maryland. If I recall correctly though the corrupt DEA agents were the ones involved in this case. So this brings into question the entire integrity of that  that case. You would think PGP would be used for such communications. If so then how do you get the chat logs? You rely on the under cover cop on the other side. But if you know these cops are corrupt and may have hacked the servers now you can't rely on the integrity of that information at all and it may very well also not have been true.

That's not how it would work out. In fact there's many reasons for pro Bitcoin socialism. 
See right now government has two options when they want to spend. Borrow, or tax. When government doesn't want to raise taxes what do they do? Borrow. This creates debt and interest on debt. In the end government may be forced to pay more because to interest than if they just saved up and spent then. In the end borrowing could actually result in less spending longer term as revenue must be paid to bankers instead of services to the public. 
So under a Bitcoin only socialism government is more or less forced to actually bring in revenue to spend because borrowing isn't that easy and they can't just print money.  Now when this happens you don't have a looming debt and government could run a surplus and eventually government pays no interest. So this force government to spend only what it has. In the end austerity doesn't get needed because government needs to start living in reality and balance it's books. So under Bitcoin socialism only exists if government can bring in tax revenue then can it spend it. If government can't it can't spend. What many would claim is socialism being done correctly and responsibility. 
Now you might say i Bitcoin  prevents taxation. Not true, yes it makes it harder for government to tax and makes it easier to conceal profit. But it doesn't stop taxation when most people won't use Bitcoin stand alone but Multi-sig type services or centralized services. It doesn't stop taxation when companies report employees earnings to government, when you have things like SSN, when payroll providers exist and also may report income and when everything goes public on the blockchain. It's impractical to just tumble millions in the course of regular business if you aren't trying to hide. And then guilt, you know there's a reason Warran Buffet finds its wrong he has a lower tax rate than his secretary and wants to pay more taxes. 
You see Bitcoin is an application ready to be used by all. It has many reasons why capitalist are pro Bitcoin, why anarchist is pro Bitcoin, why socialist can be pro Bitcoin, and why communist can be pro Bitcoin. At the end of the day Bitcoin isn't a political ideology. It's a decentralized network that adheres to its rules,  21 million max Bitcoin, block time of 10 min, block reward half every 4 years. That's  what Bitcoin cares about and people make of it what they want.

At any given moment a node uses rather small amounts of data so it's not going to slow down you Internet or look like your hosting files. But running 24/7 for a month you might see a total of 300 GB used but you can most certainly throttle and still contribute to the network. Using this estimation were taking less than one megabit pet second. Not megabyte,  bits. In other words this means an average of about 120 kilobytes per second based on my estimation. You could  most certainly run a node only some of the time and still contribute. Run it half a month or throttle it or what ever. You can easily also adjust the maximum amount of peers to be less than default. Say cap out at 15 peers (this is good amount) to reduce overall bandwidth in the long run. The 300 GB estimation was based on a post someone made here, if I recall he claimed roughly 60 peers where typically connected to his node.

Most cloud storage serve providers are not full client side encryption.
What I mean by this is stuff like Google Drive, Sky Drive, DropBox, Box these may allow an encrypted transfer between your computer to their servers but then the data is under their control. The provider may say they encrypt the contents of the hard drives in their servers but they control the keys. They can decrypt the data. Your data is never private it is in the control of someone else here. This does allow for convenient stuff like if you forgot your password you can recover the files though a password reset because you never really encrypted the files with it.
Full client side encryption like Mega and similar your computer encrypts the files with your password and then send that encrypted data to their servers. Your password is unknown by them and all encryption and decryption is done only on your computer. This means your data not once got exposed not even to their servers. This means your encryption is only as safe as your password, it also means if you forgot your password you can not reset it because that is the password which actually encrypts the data. This also means no NSA back doors because your data on their server is still encrypted by a password only you know.

No, that's called decentralization, it isn't pointless, it secures the network. It's a necessity to create a system anyone can connect to without needing permission. 


Except my credit card takes 2-3 days for something to show up on the statement, Bitcoin is instant. So it's not making it inefficient. The blockchain also secures bitcoin. If you have just a few servers we don't know what those servers are doing, who controls them, who manipulates them, etc. Not to mention that you can not play the role of that server and must rely on interacting with a bank to do so. This bank then charges a fee. With Bitcoin you can do what ever you want and not pay a fee because you don't need to go though an intermediary. 


A credit card charging fees and I  give a merchant the ability take money from me every time I pay (because credit/debit cards a a pull mechanism) This means I revealed  sensitive info that can be used to charge me in the future without my approval. With Bitcoin I don't relieve sensitive info as it is a push technique where I deposit funds to the merchant (rather than them withdraw funds to me).
Sure Bitcoin uses more processing power (if you don't like that check out POS coins), but it does so in achieving something a centralized network can't. 
Think of it this way. If 5 strangers go ahead and put down $20 each on a table it becomes very easy for us all to agree at the end that we each own $20 of that dollars. So it's very easy to believe the truth. Now we could all act in our own interest. I could say that I own $40, you say that you own $80. But we are all acting in our own self interests. We can't all still act in our own self interest and each come to the same conclusion. You can't go take $80 from the pile and not have be object. So my point is. It is very easy for a lot of strangers to agree on the truth together than it is from them to act in their own self interest. This is the basic concept of a decentralized network. Because there are so many participants no one can act in their own self interest because they will be overridden by the truth. Contrary to this your bank and credit card is centralized. They aren't a bunch of strangers so they can collaborate with each other and find something that is in their self interest and make it work because there isn't anyone to object. This is why fractional reserves are able to exist with fiat so easily.

Well with centralized escrow if say eBay implemented it for sellers there then not an issue. For dealing with sites you don't trust yes it can be a hassel there and I agree we aren't there yet more development is needed. 
A credit card can be reversed well after 30 days. The merchant gets confirmation of the payment instantly. Then usually 2 days or so after gets the money. But if after 30 days you get your statement and claim fraud then the transaction is reversed and merchant looses the money. This is why I make the comparison to bitcoin in saying a credit cards confirmation time is 30 days. With bitcoin you get unconfirmed transaction quickly. This is comparable to when a credit card is approved. Then it only takes 10 min to confirm and roughly 60 min for 6 confirmations to be considered irreversible. 
So bitcoin confirmation time 10 min. Credit card. 30 days.

Yeah but thing is they teamed up with Coinbase which is USD only. If they do all international business in USD then they could do it but presumably they want to have local currencies as well, and some jurisdictions may requiring licensing from Coinbase to do this. 
If they used BitPay they could of done that and then gone world wide. BitPay handles all the things from a legal perspective, licensing, etc. To Dell its just an other method of payment that goes straight to their bank with no charge backs.

People will always say this. It doesn't make it true and it is no more than speculation. But still you must acknowledge TOR's weakness and, theoretical attacks. 
The thing about TOR is if an attacker controls enough nodes it is very easy for them to make up all nodes in a circuit and identify users. In fact an attacker doesn't even need to control all 3 nodes that make up a circuit but only the first relay and exit node. Now no one controls enough to be able to unmask all users all the time. Agencies like the NSA and GCHQ do have a lot of TOR nodes they control though. If they cooperate with each other then this increases their power and their ability to unmask a user. This risk is reduced severely by using established nodes (guard nodes) as well as continually choosing and switching between different nodes to make up a circuit (I think new nodes are selected every 10 min by default if I remember correctly). 
What this means is that government can unmask a TOR user for a very limited period of time and that this isn't a very targeted attack as the end user chooses the nodes. For the average TOR user this isn't a big deal because in the still very unlikely event that the nodes you connect to are that of an attacker and exposer is limited to no more than a few minutes. For someone operating a hidden service I would think this presents a bigger risk as it could identify a server (which would only be attached to your real identity if you are a complete moron). 
What this means is the more peers that comprises the network the more secure it is. If honest nodes significantly outweigh malicious ones you obtain a network that can not identify a user. The greatest contribution you can make to the TOR network is to go right now and run a  (preferably relay) node. In doing so you ensure the freedom of uncensored Internet for all. 
Edit: ["TOR Sticks"](  The NSA leaked PowerPoint on identifying TOR users.

There's also reasons it's bad. Being reversible is good for some things  only if it is super easy to steel money  from me. Like a retarded credit card system where all that is needed to charge me is a couple of numbers displayed out in the open on the thing. If it's easy to fraud me being reversible is a consumer protection. If you secure your system enough so that you can't rob me then irreversible transactions are only good. In the meantime though there are insured forms of transfer for a reason. Like a cashiers cheque.

Not really % based. You have no guarantee that you will get a 50% + chance of it being verified in a few seconds. But if the block time is less then that also means less time for an alternative translation of the same coins to take place. So you can have a higher level of confidence in a smaller amount of time. Which is a plus. 
The bigger question is security. 10 min was chosen for a reason. Now from my understanding Scrypt minimizes the risk somewhat of having a shorter block time but the big question in the end is what is the risk of a small block time vs a large one and how does confirmation probably scale compared to bitcoin. (1 confirmation from a 10 min block is more secure than from a 2.5 min block. But waiting one hour for several 2.5 min block confirmations is more secure than an hour for six 10 min confirmations.

Coinkite charges fees they are  still a centralized wallet. If you feel your money is safer in their control than your own then go for it. They are Canadian based not American so it's more lax there in terms of regulatory pressure which can alter how a company behaves. But if you don't hold the keys you don't own the Bitcoin. If you don't own your own Bitcoin then other people can control what you do with them. This is your issue with Coinbase. They aren't being privacy minded and giving you freedom because architecturally they have the ability to control your funds. Use a solution where they can't control your funds and no 3rd party can then you are free. 
Keep it decentralized. Use Electrum or even Blockchain.info for that matter if you want a Web wallet (as blockchain can't control your funds). If you are unsure of the safety of your funds this way then you can use multi-sig solutions like BitGo.

They pay transaction fee even to non Coinbase address. This is effectively free. But they don't pay for micro transactions in which case it is a high 0.0005 BTC fee. 
From my understanding they allow micro transactions free within Coinbase because it is off chain and that this would require you to sign in and initiate an off-chain transaction, such as signing into Coinbase to buy item or maybe sending a Coinbase email transfer. I haven't tested this but copying someone's address is forcing it to be on-chain as the blockchain is confirming the transaction.

Duh. What's with people thinking that they can make an ASIC resistant coin. Proof of Work is built upon the desire to continually increase computing power. It is designed as an arms race. If any coin is to have any success it will inevitably develop some new form of hardware to increase hashing power. If it doesn't that coin has failed. That Litecoin is getting ASICs is just a testament of its success. While there are bound to he algorithms that cope better with ASICs than SHA-256 just by adding a dependency on large amounts of memory that still doesn't make it ASIC resistant.

Well you would need to be logged on. In chrome it is now encrypted with the windows account. But if logged onto your computer then you can easily just go to settings in chrome. hit advanced settings. Under passwords hit managed saved passwords, then go to the saved password for a site and hit show. In latest versions of chrome it is encrypted and you need to have the password for the windows account to see it and i think google account has something to do with encryption of this also. But a few versions back you didn't and then you could actually take the app data and use that to get the passwords as its not encrypted. 
In firefox there is a similar thing though if a master password is set up i think you would need to know it to get to view the saved passwords. I remember back in the days where firefox you could look inside the app data and right there in plain text you would see the passwords just by opening a file with notepad. Now i think that would be long gone as security becomes more of a concern, but I couldn't sat for sure.  But if you have basic knowledge of the user and/or you use the same user account, you can find the passwords.

The licensing on content on Dish is US only. The licensing in Canadian Satellite providers is for Canadian residents only. But it is satellite still which can be used in more than one county. Most certainly urban areas of Canada if it serves the US. So some people would rather have Dish as opposed to Bell or Shaw Direct as it means a different channel selection. Bitcoin is not bound to a nation state, so anyone anywhere could pay for the service without them knowing about it.

Bitpay bitcoin. PayPal credit cards. Bitcoin with PayPal an all in one. You know why PayPal charges such a high fee? They take a cut, the credit card network takes a cut, then the card issuer takes a cut. Bitpay takes a cut to. So bitcoin in PayPal reduces the fee significantly for bitcoin payments. This does cause one problem though. With Bitpay you know there will be no charge backs. I find it unlikely PayPal with make a bitcoin specific section, they would likely integrate it in a way you don't know what you are receiving and you will still see charge backs because of this so Bitpay serves a purpose.

The idea is that doing so is making it easy to lend which then helps out the economy and creates growth. But no doubt it's artificial. Then inflation acts as a hidden tax. This is especially troubling in the US as US banks all offer rates on savings products that can never make up for the losses you experience with inflation where as with other countries as like many in the EU and Canada it is possible to gain enough interest if you look in the right places to not have to worry about inflation. 
That the big banks in the US only offer 0.1% interest is a joke when my checking account pays higher interest than that.

It seems over all Coinjoin based mixers are still good in that it let's you hide yourself on the blockchain from prying eyes from easily seeing what you are doing at a low cost but if you have a forensic team after you it won't cut it but to be extra private and use several mixers is costly as they take a cut.

Global support means you can sign up from anywhere and select your language. I see no indication that they support foreign currency or foreign banking networks. Credit cards integrate seamlessly with foreign currency transactions. Please note that most credit cards charge about 2.5% foreign currency transaction fee paid to either MasterCard or Visa. 
Unless your country also uses USD or you have USD account then global support doesn't mean much at all and Circle doesn't benefit foreign users. If you think oh I'll use Circle because it's free and Coinbase is 1% then Circle sounds better. But if you are in Europe due to the hidden fees of the fiat banking system you pay less with Coinbase. If your in Canada and think hey instant buy with Circle for free but you don't fund from USD account and you pay 2% in credit card fees and 2.5% in foreign transaction fees then it is way cheaper to buy Bitcoin instantly with Interac Online for 0.5% or less fee.

You can get money in and out of them but it is not as easy as with other  exchanges. They also seem to favour the use of 3rd party payment processors to process the transaction (though I believe you can still wire them directly). As a result fees for  getting money in and out of BTC-e increase. Traders make up for this increase in fees by trading at a rate lower than other exchanges. So you can't just look at the price difference and think there is easy arbitrage  opportunity.

I never once walked to a bank to get my bitcoins. I did it all on a website and hold independent of a bank. Now the only operating costs (and subsequently electricity and CO2 output) of Bitcoin is what it takes to staff a head quarters and run a website.
 Look at the bottom of this article. You see that the amount  they calculated for CO2 output is 90 something percent from bank branches which are very expensive to staff. Bitcoin being roughly online only and to be used be the whole online banking style digital savvy crowd this eliminates branches and the need of many employees in the financial services industry revolving  around bitcoin. 
So it's not unreasonable to think no matter how big bitcoin grows that it will evolve to be primary a [direct banking]( style approach which uses up less electricity and therefore carbon emissions. I can't picture coinbase ever having branches everywhere like Bank of America.

That doesn't necessarily mean more fees. Seeing how high fee transactions are prioritized if the demand is roughly the same for transactions then higher blocksize means users need to pay less in fees as low fee transactions can now fit in the block. This disincentives you to pay high fees. This could then result in less revenue. However if everyone still pays the same fees and doesn't acknowledge their ability to pay much lower fees then this can mean more revenue. The market decides.

I have a personal checking account though for that. The same bank (Tangerine, formally known as ING Direct Canada) is 1.3% on savings for any amount be it $500 or $100k, etc. I use different bank for savings which will give me between 2-3% interest (depending on if tax free or not, tax free being 3% option). So if bank charged me, or even someone with a very high balance only I'd be quite a change. I'm sure in Germany even they will see people avoid that bank and "shop" elsewhere.

Stopping transaction mailability from what I have read would take a long time to fix as the whole network would need to make small changes. Not everyone runs the same software so changes must be implemented very gradually. 
But regardless that's not a problem. Mailability is only a big problem for services that aren't prepared for it. For a experienced crew a service could be made and fixes can be issued that would take care of this problem relatively easily. 
So again. Not a problem in bitcoin. It is a problem in some people's implementation of a way to match a transfer of bitcoins to a certain customer.
In other words although the issue won't disappear with ease it is something that can be turned into a non issue and for many services it already is a non issue.

making a bitcoin transfer and having a wallet is as simple as downloading an app on your phone. That's easier than making an ebay account and far easier than opening a bank account. 
The problem for now though is getting dollars into bitcoin. You can do it with ease once you are set up and it is becoming far more easy as well. But right now you need to go register with an exchange, verify. For a large part it can easily take you a week or two to be able to buy a few hundred dollars of bitcoin then there are fees involved. It is not as easy as just using your credit card. This waiting gap is shrinking though and there are already some ways to do so quicker, just look at Circle they seem very promising but the ability to buy quickly and easily vary from country to country for example you can buy instantly in Canada with InstaBT. 
 This slowness is due to KYC and AML laws requiring you to prove who you are when buying as well as how dollars are very slow to transfer and they are often reversible when bitcoin isn't.
edit: of course you also got to realize that holding a decent amount of bitcoin independent of a company and doing so securely has a bit of a learning curb to it as well.

If you put bitcoin into any exchange or hosted wallet that does  off-chain transactions and then withdraw you will most of the time get different bitcoins. You in return let that one site know what you spent where but it's no longer public. Coinbase for example does off-chain transaction so  when you use them to spend bitcoins merchants and your peers don't know where they went out came from because next time you spend bitcoin you are spending other users pools of Bitcoin. Something  like Blockchain.info wallet or Electrum is fully on-chain so you always get your bitcoins not someone else's. 
Of course if you really value your privacy then you will use multiple different services together, such as various different exchanges, tumblers and different ways of exchanging between them (eg. With altcoins). This way can be more expensive and time consuming with all the confirmations what would be needed. 
The question comes down  to how much do you value your privacy? If you are good forking over what you do to one company in exchange for not having the world know your spending habits on the blockchain then it's inexpensive and practical. If you want to hide from them what you are doing, you can't entirely but you can use a combination of services together to break the link. But expect tumblers to take high fees and most of us won't see that as worth it. When you aren't doing anything illegal you only need a little bit of privacy, not to destroy the evidence. 
Regardless you always want to use new address as much as possible in order to increase your privacy, nor reuse address and use deterministic wallets if possible.

To Sum it up the Fed is a state owned bank. It operates on its own, chooses much of its own employees and so forth. So yes it operates with no or minimal interference from government. But it is also owned mostly by the government. The US government keeps the profits of the Federal Reserve. It goes to the Treasury. The Fed buys bonds off of what may very well be money that didn't even exist to start with. They then get paid interest from the US government. The profits the Fed makes are then mostly given back to the US government. It's like taking money out of ones pocket to put in the other and charging a fee. 
Now notice how I said some? Many central banks operate much like I described above but there is some private ownership in the Fed making it different. Each bank which is part of the Federal Reserve System owns shares in their regional federal reserve. The Fed isn't just one bank it's a couple and each regional reserve has its stock holders and it's stock holders get paid and choose most of the chairman of this federal reserve. But it doesn't work like normal stock. They don't have much control over what they fed does and their vote isn't proportional to the amount of stocks they hold. By law when a bank joins the federal reserve system it is required to own stock in it. So how much profit goes to share holders? 


Further more that national debt. Yeah that's an other delusion. Yep a good portion is owned to the Fed but an even larger portion is owned to China. But who else owns it? US government agencies. They take peoples social security funds to buy bonds. So tax payers are paying the interest on this in order to combat inflation. Relying  on new money to make gains on old which they spent. Starts sounding  like a ponzi scheme. 
Read this it explains it well. But go off calling it private after watching a YouTube video without actually looking into it's ownership. 
Edit: I think I forgot this part. But there are some other share holders in the regional feds other than just member banks. We do not know who they are as being state owned the banks are not publicly traded, this means stock holders do not need to be publicly mentioned. So they are a secret. But look at the facts they aren't running the thing.

I don't pay banks to keep my money, I avoid big banks like the plague. Tangerine is entirely free chequeing and was the first ever ING Direct in the world. It was the first bank that had online banking in the country. So I use them for free no fee chequeing. Even so with a minimum balance big banks will waive the monthly fee. I do banking with such ease when I deposit my cheques by taking a picture of them. 
Big banks screw people over but they do offering Interac online. While bank transfers in the UK are far superior to the rest of the  world you can still buy bitcoins instantly with Interac Online in Canada. You still can't do that in the UK. Literally instantly 4 mouse clicks is all it takes. But only 4 banks in the  country support this forum of online payment, the same banks that charge fees. You can also send an email money transfer from and to any bank in the country it only takes roughly 30 min to be received end to end no holding period. This is real nice. 
Basically the banking system here is just as legacy as the US except for anything Interac/Acxsys comes out with which is actually pretty world leading. 
Edit: you can get free chequeing from PC Financial (CIBC ATM machines and subsidy) Tangerine (Scotiabank ATM machines and subsidiary, also pays interest on chequeing) and Canadian Direct Financial (Exchange Network ATMs and Canadian Western Bank subsidiary)

Well Germans haven't used Marks for quite some time. But you need to get that there are two aspects to bitcoin here. One is that bitcoin once you understand it is very easy to use to send bitcoins, it is quick and similar to an email (although you wouldn't remember the bitcoin address) it is non reversible so make sure it's the right address. 
With bitcoin you would have a [wallet app on computer or phone]( send bitcoins to your wallet you hold them there and then send bitcoins to the other address type in your password and the other person will receive them. But I'm assuming you have less interest in sending bitcoin to your uncle but much rather euros since that's what he uses to buy things.
So this is where you need to by bitcoin. USD is slow to transfer, Euros far quicker. You need to go and transfer USD to an exchange and buy bitcoins with it. Then once that money is received you can buy your bitcoins then once that has happened send your bitcoins to your uncles wallet or much rather his account at an exchange which he can then use to trade those bitcoins for Euros to send to his bank account. 
So you would want to use [Coinbase]( in this case, some bitcoiners may criticize them as they are not as decentralized as many would like but that won't be a problem for you, they are also very noob friendly so for getting started I recommend you use them as a wallet and a place to buy/sell bitcoins. Your uncle in Germany while he can use them as a wallet can't use Coinbase to buy/sell so he'll want to use Bitcoin.de to sell your bitcoins. Now from my understanding Coinbase let's you buy bitcoins in 3 ways I've never used them to buy though so do your research on the side. From my understanding you can do it Immediately with a credit card (though they will only do this with more trusted customers) or the more likely of two is for you to do it via an ACH transfer to them. This I believe can be done two ways. In that you buy immediately at current bitcoin price but only receive the bitcoins once the ACH transfer has cleared or you wait for the transfer to clear and then buy. The later of the two is what you would want because if bitcoin's prices dropped over the 5 days it takes to clear then you lost money but if you wait for funds to clear and then buy then send to your uncle and then he trades immediately there is no longer that risk of loosing money as this can all be done within an hour. Bitcoin.de is more of an actual exchange unlike coinbase in which your uncle can set a bid/ask price for his bitcoin but to get his euros immediately he would sell at market price.
Now just to be clear each exchange and method of buy/selling bitcoins for Euros/Dollars take a fee, some smaller than others. This means that to send USD especially to someone else in America it is likely more expensive as things stand using bitcoin because while bitcoin is fee to send and receive trading bitcoin for fiat currency isn't. However when sending USD to Europe to be traded for EUR then due to the exchange rate that big banks will give you it will almost certainty cost you less using bitcoin as opposed to methods like Western Union to send money which take high fees for exchange rate. Note that when banks and WU take the fee for USD/EUR it is a hidden fee, they don't tell you about it they just say 1 USD is worth X amount of EUR according to them however the official exchange rate you see on Google would give you more EUR in the end. Using bitcoin to send can often give you something much closer to the official exchange rate. 
Regardless I advice you play around with a few dollars in bitcoin learn how to secure your wallets, make backups and send between wallets before doing it with a lot of money you could loose.
**TL;DR**: Bitcoin will save you money on Internationale transfers and is worth looking into if you do them frequently but as things stand for most people more conventional methods are easier. Over time though this will change as more bitcoin companies rise and their fees go down. Also when [Harbor.ly]( launches in the EU and America it will make your life easier for the average Joe to send money between these two countries. 
@_date: 2014-03-24 13:37:04
Same as coinbase right now. Once they launch coinbase will need to drop fee to compete. In turn so will harbor.ly at least in US market. From my understanding they will be using multiple exchanges to source their coins so you might get better prices just from that alone. Plus they have litecoin support.

You can set up multisig wallets with Amory and choose either 2 of 3 or 3 of 3 key pairs depending on your desires. Just remember that you are now not just relying on yourself to protect and not loose that private keys but on other people as well.

Not quite sure if I understand the Soviet Canada part there. Regulations seem stricter in US also in relation to this. Just look at Harbor.ly a up and coming Coinbase competitor. The founder of it is American but moved to Canada to set up shop because it is more bitcoin friendly here. Also in the US you need licensing at federal and state level. In Canada you need Federal only. On top of that Fintrac the Canadian version of Fincen has said AML laws don't apply to bitcoin and it is out of their jurisdiction. Though that is likely to change, overall bitcoin companies here treat it as if AML laws do apply. 
One of the senators there in that video and other testimonies actually kept very close to that. Talking about how introducing all this strict regulation CaVirtex is talking about would threaten bitcoin and bring  up the costs while increasing  the barrier to entry and would therefore be bad. He also mentioned he has a coinbase account. I like that guy.

The big powerful banks will shun Bitcoin and call for its demise. The small ones will adopt it and use it most notably as an international money transmitter service. This gives them a competitive edge it also solves problems for these small banks as they don't have an established system of trust with larger correspondent banks. Then when big banks start to take notice that they are losing customers and operate on a slow out of date system they will have no choice but to adopt Bitcoin.

You can be your own bank, most people aren't responsible enough to secure their money so that's why a bank like institution can be used. 
You can't call bitcoin insecure because 1/3rd (where's the source on that?) of users loose them. Just like how you can be your own bank you can store your own bitcoins securely, like a  cold storage multisig wallet. This is why I said it can be most secure if you know how. You need to know what you are doing to make it secure.

@_date: 2014-09-11 19:32:14
Bitcoin are stored everywhere. You just hold access to a set of Bitcoin on a ledger distributed to the public called the Blockchain. This is a private key you hold.
You can use a service like Coinbase to buy (assuming you mean USD) and hold your Bitcoin in Coinbase's wallet. This means Coinbase controls the private key. They work like a bank. You could use an app on your phone or computer that is a thin wallet. This is where you hold the key independent of anyone. This means not forking over any personal info to hold Bitcoin and no 3rd party risk. This makes it like holding cash.

I couldn't agree more. They can't stop bitcoin. But they can still inhibit the market from using bitcoin as they want. What happens if a 16 year old makes a hosted wallet. What if you download Blockchain.info off Github? Next thing you know you're an international money transmitter and you did it in only a few hours. Being the Internet it can grow fast. If laws are broad on stuff then that inhibits so many potential start ups and potential uses. Also do these laws apply to any business choosing to accept  bitcoin independent of bank like service offered by bitcoin dealing companies? 
They want to prevent  Gox and they want very strict KYC and AML.

Multibit downloads the most minuscule parts of the blockchain, it wouldn't have  problem. Electrum is entirely a thin wallet only getting info from servers.

And yet no one explains to you **what cold storage means.**
The way bitcoin works is that the network recognize a public key and your wallet is a private key. The private key determines what the public key (the address is) but the public key can not be used to determine what the private key is. The private key is what's used to spend the bitcoin. 
**The electrum seed determines what the private key is.**
What this all means is that you do not need to connect a computer to the Internet to create a private key (generated randomly)  and then figure out the corresponding public key. So cold storage means you can create a bitcoin address by not ever connecting to the Internet. **More specifically cold storage means that the private key** *(needed for spending the bitcoins)* **never touches the Internet** cold storage can be as much as a peice of paper with a qr code to a offline computer. This computer generated the public key which he then sends his bitcoins to. So the **private key aka wallet never needs to touch the Internet to send bitcoins to it** this is useful as hackers and viruses can not get at the private key and therefore steel your bitcoin. **this is functional because you do not need to have your wallet connected to the Internet to receive coin only to spend them**
**to determine the amount of bitcoin he has** go on a computer not connected to, nor ever connected to the Internet. And that never will be. Then open electrum when you want to restore a seed and enter it. Now you have control of the private keys. Now electrum knows the public keys. It can't tell you the balance as it is not connected to the internet. But it will tell you the address. 
Go on a separate computer than the one that is connected to the Internet. Go to blockchain.info then enter a address in the search (exactly as written in electrum on other computer. Same letter case)  and it will tell you the balance of that address. 
**change addresses** these addresses are one time use. Electrum won't know which change addresses where used and contain coins unless connected to the internet so if he ever spent Coins from that wallet then you may have more than you think as you would need to restore the seed on a computer when  time to spend. Most coins will not be in these changes addresses as they are, well, change.

No question about it you would need to keep every aspect of who you are entirely separate. No matching of IPs and accounts that link to any other IP in anyway. Different MAC addresses may be useful to. TOR and a VPN to connect to an exist node all the time. No doubt it would still be very difficult to pull off and time consuming to pull off without making human error. 


Yeah we really have no idea what CSEC has been doing exactly, they won't tell us much. But we do no they did on the behalf of private businesses conduct corporate espionage on Brazilian mining companies. It's well known that government monitors WIFI at the air ports also. Wasn't long in the media that there was a story about how one of the big telecom companies is handing over access to consumers data extremely frequently to law enforcement. They didn't name which company. 
My point is I was trying to illustrate is that what they are doing is still outside of the law and courts have made rules on these things. The government still attacks the government from within though the judicial branch. If those being compelled into doing something stood up for them selves they can win. It takes a lot of money.

What I'm saying is for a cash advance in Canada I don't get charge fees straight up only interest which is calculated daily, So if I do cash advance to  a company like Circle and pay it back later today I didn't pay a fee. CapitalOne is charging 3% straight up on top of interest. 
Now when my interest rate is 11.9% annual on a cash advance that means I can borrow $100 today for 5 months and I will have paid the same amount in interest that CapitalOne in the US charges straight up over the course of just 1 day.

It comes down to how many kilobytes will fit into a block. The smaller the block size the less transactions will fit it in it. Now miners prioritize transactions with the highest fees. So if the block can only fit in X amount of transactions then most would probably be free or low fee. If this is the case they would be excluded and only high fees accepted creating incentive to pay fees (look up discuss fish mining pool).  If the mining pools decide to publish large blocks then more transactions can be made. If this means losing money though they would enforce smaller block sizes to incentive higher fees. This still doesn't limit the amount of transactions per block because if everyone pays fees there is incentive to publish larger blocks as you accept more transactions and more income. 
So really. We don't know how fees will play out because there are so many variables. You would need to have bitcoins be worth enough and used frequently enough to not need to rely on the block reward to subsidize transactions. A credit card isn't the same as a bitcoin transaction though in that the fees paid in bitcoin are not a percentage of the transactions. The block reward would only cease to exist in the year 2140. So we won't even be around to find out what happens then. Satoshi was smart in making it so that the minting of coins slow out over the progressive increase in the level of adoption.

If you have a bank account that supports Interac Online you can buy instantly. It's kind of like the envy of the world. No one else can deposit money into an exchange directly from their bank account instantly but Canadians. All 3 Canadian exchanges support Interac online. (VOS, CaVirtex, QuadregaCX). If your bank doesn't support Interac Online these exchanges can do a direct withdrawal via EFT (takes 3-5 days) from your bank account. The exchanges are the best, cheapest and with Interac fastest way to buy Bitcoin. They require KYC of varying strictness depending on the deposit methods you will use. 
If you don't want to go through the KYC process of the exchanges QuickBt, InstaBt, and Instacoins allow you to buy online near instantly with Interac Online. These charge quite the mock up and I have used ATMs that have lower fees than them. These also have limits on amount purchased (QuickBt is 0.2 BTC, InstaBt is 0.5).
So yeah Bitcoin ATMs you can use but they charge a high mock up as well. Same as Local Bitcoins. But those two methods are inconvenient. 
Like I said Interac Online is best method and the only instant method in Canada it's also the cheapest way to but Bitcoin if done through an exchange. 
Only the fallowing  support Interac online:
* BMO Bank of Montreal
* Envision Financial
* Libro Credit Union
* Scotiabank
* TD Canada Trust
* RBC Royal Bank
Note even if you have account at one of those banks it will not work with accounts that have a Visa debit card (TD most notably). 
Myself I use Tangerine as main bank so when I want to buy Bitcoin instantly I do an Interac email money transfer (e-transfer) this (unlike Interac Online) is supported by pretty much all banks and credit unions. This allows you to send money near  instantly (takes about 30 min to arrive) to any Bank account for a $1-$1.50 fee. So I do e-transfer to my BMO account on the side and then deposit to exchange via Interac online. BMO is only of the big 5 that offer a Pay-As-You-go account where it is no monthly fee only $1 per transaction. The 4 biggest banks offer $4 a month account with 10-12 free transactions a month. 
Even if you pay $1 for e-transfer and $1-2 dollars to bank then $1.50 to VOS for deposit this is instant and still cheaper than the (I think it's) $7 they charge for an EFT. So it's worth it.

Due to the nature of Bitcoin the merchant will never incur the costs of fraud. With credit cards a seller must anticipate that a certain percentage of all sales he will loose the entire revenue for and also need to pay the credit card payment processor a fee for being the victim of fraud (about $15). With Bitcoin there is 0% chance the merchant will loose his money as no charge back can take place.
This doesn't mean that fraudsters won't take advantage of Bitcoin buyers. For example if I buy a video game off you with Bitcoin and I don't receive it then you still have the money and I can not do a charge back (escrow systems serve to protect the buyer in this case while still making it so merchant doesn't suffer risk of chargeback). People will also take advantage of the irreversibility of Bitcoin in regards to hacking users wallets and steeling their Bitocoin.

No one is forcing you to use Circle. You feel they are monitoring you. Well they probably are. So don't use them. 
For starters banks monitor your account for suspicious activity. It alters them to fraud so it can be stopped. This is why my banks that don't support 2FA specifically enforce weak as shit passwords (seriously wtf Tangerine and BMO 6 character max, really?) manage to stay alive, because they  monitor user activity for fraud. Circle is offering insured deposits. It's in their interest to stop fraud from occurring. Being that they are required to be a MSB this also means they must monitor/report transactions above $10k.
Now it's perfectly reasonable for you not to like this. So don't use them. Use dark wallet, be independent, control the private keys. You have the ability to do so and that is the beauty of this technology. Embrace it. As for the general public. Well their bank already monitors them. 
Now coin validation that's a different story. With the large potential Circle has to be a huge merchant payment processor their adaptation of coin validation would most certainly be devastating and that we would want to stop.

I only watched 2 hearings. The one on the third was with a University professor. He explained how it works. I feel the senators still have no understanding of how it works. He also never explained what private keys and public keys are. They never grasped the concept of how with bitcoin you are your own bank. A senator even asked. Are there any banks that take bitcoin? The concept of decentralization being explained to 50+ year old sure is hard and the message wasn't conveyed. 
Upon watching the one with CaVirtex and BitAcess. It was largely just CaVirtex saying how we need more regulation and should be treated as a foreign currency. One of the senators in both hearings made it clear he was very sceptical of this idea and that regulation might be bad and is a huge burden. When asked why ask for it. the CEO said quit simply put. The banks won't do business without it. His right hand man though seemed to be calling for licensing and a entry barrier for the competition. I didn't like that.

I think I'll start using greenaddress.it from now on though. I don't like how it's only a 2 of 2 multisig wallet as opposed to the 2 of 3 that Bitgo offers. But Bitgo doesn't even have an app. Plus greenaddress.it is a deterministic wallet I believe.

I think just that they are offering branch support is huge. I work for a firm that conducts customer satisfaction surveys for 2 of Canada's largest banks. I can tell you that the most common complaint has nothing to do with the people at the branch but the bank it's self,  The rates, etc. 
Yet many people really like the customer service a branch provides. They like having a physical place to go when they feel welcome and can interact with people if they want help or don't understand things. This is the majority of the public, they want reassurance and to know something  exists and isn't just a website. Something really helpful for the older generation. 
If you truly look at the banking situation in Canada if you want a GIC (term deposit) or a savings account the big banks are truly appalling but they are there to explain to the people who know no better. 
With Bitcoin it is all on the Web. You are in control of your money. But most people actually don't want that. They are not responsible enough to have full control. The moment you put Neo and Bee on the block people are reassured. They feel professionals are there and when they want help or to discuss things they know someone can answer their questions.

Find that hard to believe. Canada makes up a very small market share of Bitcoin. However it is regarded as a safe haven for Bitcoin and is the number 2 country (only second to the US) in terms of venture capital investment in Bitcoin (according to Coindesk and every major media outlet that literally just quoted Coindesk). 
Prices are going up currently but that's largely just due to rebounding from the recent low of roughly $300. So no one can really tell, while it can be a contributing factor to an increase in price it sure isn't causing no rally. For the record the US senate hearing also so a lot of other stuff going on before it (eg. China) and prices where rising before the hearing, the hearing only added fuel to the fire.

A redistribution of wealth by way of social services. 
Someone has $1 million socialism says let's tax him so he has less but this hobo gets health care and this poor child has the opportunity to go to college and make a life for him self. Of course it could also go to the extreme in which it starts lowering the income discrepancy severely which arguably would be a bad thing. 
Of course a large part of are right wing libertarians so they will shit on socialism and view it as the extreme and say that it is like the government saying oh we are going to tax you 2 dollars but only give you 1 dollar worth of services or that people can't foot the bill of social services so the government runs up a debt. But only in America is the mainstream view that socialism is evil. 
I think in the future you will see even socialists societies embrace bitcoin as it forces you to actually pay for what is used as the government can't just print money. It means if 1 dollar is spent on health care someone else actually needed to pay for it. Bitcoin allows for a low cost distribution of wealth that forces transparency which cuts out government waist (no more $400 shovels and toilet seats) But only time will tell and I'll probably get down voted for saying this.

Remember that Bitcoin really aren't something you store. They are all over the internet as it is a distributed ledger. In a sense every node in the network holds your Bitcoin. 
What owner ship of Bitcoin gets defined as is holding the private keys. So while everyone has your Bitcoin only the person with a key to unlock it can spend it. We therefore consider the person to have the key to be the owner of the Bitcoin. 
A wallet holds these private keys, in the case of Circle they hold the private keys. Since he who owns the private key owns the Bitcoin this means Circle owns the Bitcoin on your behalf. Using a wallet of your own makes you independent as you hold it your self. 
So when holding Bitcoin yourself you must be careful. You must have a back up of these keys incase one gets lost. You don't so much need to  be consciously aware of these keys as wallet software handles it all in the background. However to grasp the concept of a paper wallet and it's usefulness you should. These private keys must be kept private so you want to have a strong password that encrypts them and you don't share them with people.
So what is a paper wallet. It's a peace of paper that has the private key to your Bitcoin address written on it. So this is useful because of malware. If your computer is infected with viruses they might try and steel your private keys. So you put them on paper. Due to the way Bitcoin works you don't need the internet to generate private keys. So what users do is use a computer that doesn't have internet access, never has, and never will. You generate the keys on this computer and then print it out as a paper wallet. This is what you call cold storage. It means that your Bitcoin have never once ben exposed to any component that a hacker could try and attack. Essentially a paper wallet (is made properly) makes it impossible for anyone to steel your Bitcoin remotely as they need physical access to the paper. 


My self I would recommend Electrum as it is a deterministic wallet. For example with Bitcoin QT it generates an address and each address afterwards that it generates is entirely new. So if you lost your wallet and went to an old back up all the new Bitcoins aren't in that back up. With a deterministic wallet like Electrum all Bitcoin  address from the past and from the future are stored in the backup. So you don't need to make constant backups for new addresses as it remains safe. 
Bitgo is also a good option for new users security wise as it is multi sig (apparently its the wallet Ashton Kutcher uses). The way BitGo works is they hold 1 key, you hold 2 keys of which 1 key is your main one (that you use for regular spending) the other key is your back up key. Now BitGo is a 2 of 3 multisig. So this means you need 2 of the 3 keys to spend Bitcoin. So what happens is you use one to sign a transaction and BitGo uses the other. Since both keys are needed is your computer is compromised BitGo has limits on your spending that protects you from a hacker as the hacker can't use your key to spend Bitcoin. This also means that (unlike Circle) BitGo doesn't control your Bitcoin because they need you to move it. The backup key is something you keep ultra safe which is used incase BitGo disapears and they can't sign a transaction. By using your main key and your back up key together this means 2 of 3 keys are available and the Bitcoin is still yours.

1. No and yes. It's not a stock. It may behave similarly but you can't classify it as one. But in reference to what you said. In that case. Yes. You can only sell it for what ever value people are willing to pay for it. That is where bitcoin gets its price.

This can only be done if the person knows the bitcoin address you control) **No on can control your bitcoins without your wallet unencrypted** so if you loose your wallet and have no back up. Yes you loose your bitcoins.
3. Nodes distribute the transaction history of bitcoins and balance of an account in a ledger called the blockchain. Do bitcoins ever exist on your computer or phone or a website. Nope. what exists instead is a private key. A key that unlocks a set of bitcoins recognized by the network. So bitcoins don't literally exist on your computer. They exist online distributed. A key to unlock your bitcoins is what exists on your computer. Your address is a public key whos balance is public and that corresponds to this private key you control. So it can be said bitcoins exist on your computer as it behaves that way. Such as how no one can seize the bitcoins. But in reality all that exists is the key to the lock that is your bitcoins.

Since Dollars are in essence  (special permissions aside) are essentially illegal then Dollars have a black market rate. This is known as the Blue Dollar. Bitcoin in Argentina essentially tracks the USD price. But Argentinians view the exchange rate of Pesos to USD not as the official rate but the Blue Dollar rate. As such Bitcoin are traded for the Blue Dollar rate. This means that while the interbank rate of ARS/USD might show Bitcoin is being worth double when compared to the black market rate of ARS/USD it shows BTC/ARS being not over valued but just about right.
This aside there are arbitrage opportunists between countries. I have noticed on European exchanges and many places over seas that there is roughly a 2-3% increase in value than on US and Canadian exchanges. Still this is much smaller of a difference than in Argentine due to the Blue Dollar. 
Of course this means huge arbitrage opportunities if you can pull it off. Buy Bitcoin in one coutnry, go to Argentina, sell for Pesos, then bring Pesos bank and exchange for local currency, repeat. Not sure how easy that would be though due to currency controls.

Fractional reserve would be very risky with Bitcoin. With Fiat you have the central banks money and bank credit indistinguishable from one and other. The bank is able to grow their balance sheet with the fractional reserve. Now with Bitcoin a bank can't give me a fake Bitcoin. It must be real because all it takes if for an app to verify if it's legit in a second. So this would make a fractional reserve based on no bank credit very unstable as there is now an absolute requirement to give out $1000 in a loan of $1000 worth of deposits vs creating more money.
Bitcoin fractional reserves could be used with very high reserves 50%+ but even then that's a risk (unless parent bank can create dollars to buy more Bitcoin on the open market). Term deposits are the only safe way to operate Bitcoin lending services. You deposit 2 BTC for the period of 5 years and get interest. Now the bank will have received that Bitcoin back and give you your share with interest paid. It eliminates savings accounts and creates more stable banking system but CDs, GICs, etc. are still used.

You know, you don't need to be libertarian to look at something and draw a reasonable conclusion. 
Bitcoin is based on math, it regulates it's self. If you have cryptographic proof of reserve for example, then why have costly bureaucratic government audits when the world can audit you for free? Just an example, but my point is you don't need to be libertarian to see a sense of reason in the ideology. Its not a, you're with us or your against us sort of thing.

Except that the Federal reserves interest rate is 0.08% where as the Bank of Canada is 1%.
On a side note [Canada's external debt is $29,625 per capita, or 64% of it's GDP compared to the US with $58,437 per capita or 106% of it's GDP]( Which still is nothing when compared to a country like Luxembourg with a debt of $3,696,467 per capita, 3,443% of it's GDP. 
Now to be fair there is more debt at the provincial level in Canada (the guys who pay for healthcare) relative to may states debts in terms of their population. But even then Quebec and Ontario (the two provinces  with the highest debt in Canada) once taking into account their total provincial debt and their share of the federal debt brings it to [117% and 82% respectively]( which is either lower or not much higher than the total US national debt (which isn't taking into consideration state debt). You get a lot for your taxes when it actually goes back to the people who pay them instead of funding war and prisons.

Jokes (and anticipated downvotes) aside I withdrew my Bitcoins on Sunday from CaVirtex with no problem. There is however [an other post]( on collaborating that their hot wallet hasn't been refilled for past 24 hours or so.
I doubt they are dumping Bitcoins with the intent of buying back. If they are it would need to be on an other exchange. The prices could drop to $0 on CaVirtex and the world wouldn't notice. While there is a huge sell wall on CaVirtex right now Canadian exchanges are far to low volume to change the worlds prices. 
Now sure they do have reserves and who knows what is happening with those. But they maintain an active charge you $50 if you leave your Bitcoin with us long enough policy with the intent of discouraging people from holding Bitcoin there. So I doubt their reserves are massive, looking at their order book only they have 2538 BTC in escrow.

Okay I get it now. So basically hackers get a set of bitcoins then when people try to withdraw bitcoin they get those same bitcoins except they have already been sent and as such the transaction fails? 
If gox doesn't have the funds they surely can get quite a lot now. Bitcoins are locked into their exchange but you can still trade. They make a fee off all this day trading. They can then buy cheap coins also. If they planned it out well they got plenty of USD in the exchange now and are buying like mad. They could at least recover some funds. Would make sense as to why they required verification to withdraw bitcoins now. With that said if  hacker did pull this off they know who they are unless documents are forged.

True tough there is no denying to cost effectiveness of direct banks. Some big banks now own direct banks and their direct banking division constantly offers better service and higher rates than their parent company simply because it's such a low operating expense. This approach also allows small banks and credit unions to expand nationally and offer their services to a very broad user base and compete with the big guys. This is the only reason some direct banks have insanely higher rates. It's not just that the business model means lower operating costs but it is also the only things preventing an oligopoly in the banking sector. We can think the internet for this. Not just for direct banks but also for giving us something bigger: Bitcoin

Hold. I sold some at the 400ish mark in a little crash before the 1200 peak but bought back right after to see prices go higher. Haven't sold since other than a little I sold just to buy back In a separate occasions. I'm holding though haven't sold to cash out as an acceptance of losses. I didn't own bitcoin during get the April bubble but I watched it very closely. Needless to say I learned not to sell. prices will come back up over time. I'm not really at a loss (other than what I loss from neo stock) I might be a little under due to low prices now but going back to 600 is enough to make me happy. Mind you I did spend some coins around the peak so I got a lot of bank records to go over to find out if I am at a loss of gain more but I think overall I break even. Looking at last bubble and seeing a price of 1200 I knew that was irrationally high. You can't expect that not to come down, to see at at 450 now is no shock to me after seeing it Spike to 1200 from under 200. Just remember, if you are new to this, buy in early enough, don't panic sell, but also if the prices look to high to be true, they probably are, a market will always correct it's self you want to recognize the signs and get in early enough at the beginning of the bubble so far after a crash it is always higher than before the bubble. And learn what the bull trap is.

No KYC, no AML, no name or info, no waiting in line. Just walk up and leave. The ability to send money anywhere in the world and it takes no longer than 1 minute. If I want I could use the address of a brain wallet and store the money in my mind. Think about that, the ability to zap cash into your mind, into your memory. Remembering the store of value. 
That's vastly different than walking up to an ATM with my debit card and depositing cash to my account. I can't do what I just described above without Bitcoin. It's the future, beaming money anywhere isntantly.

But how. They aren't going to get the block reward. What you going to do take all the transaction fees and give a small portion to the node? That just takes money away from the miners which have a high cost to get into mining and then not only do they loose it but to pay all nodes you would need to raise the transaction fee significantly. If all your doing is giving them microtransaction of very small amount then it is no different than no reward at all. It's only POS coins that have accomplished the rewarding of nodes and it will stay that way.

Lots, Apple once again is doing what they do best. Taking something that Google already came up with for 2-3 years. Refining it, throwing their logo and a bunch of money at it. Then calling  it their own invention and waiting for the masses to eat it up. 
ApplePay presumably needs supported Apple payment terminal right? Meanwhile if your phone/carrier supports NFC/Google Wallet you can pay at any merchant that accepts PayWave/PayPass over NFC with your phone. So Google already has the ability to be more wide spread than Apple in this industry and doesn't require any specific actions to be taken by the merchant.

No. Credit cards aren't insured. There are consumer protections but that's different. If someone skims my card and goes buys a 60" TV then I see it on my statement a few days latter I call up the credit card company and they *reverse* the transaction. I get my money back but the merchant looses his money and the theft still keeps the TV. The store just lost a few grand and had no knowledge of this immediately. 
In reference to your other remark it seems that there was no fee paid. This means it can take more than an hour to confirm. The network can be monitored to see if it is still a pending  transaction. I would think this could be detected fairly quickly by the network if Wallet software is made to monitor for this sort of activity and then the transaction is declined. 
Yes it might be easier to be a hacker and double spend then claim fraud on credit card as it is illegal and if not legitimate and they will likely investigate. But the tech does exist to see how many nodes have heard of the first transaction  (and supposedly it can be 90% sure very quickly) so it is safe to accept, which is better than the credit card where you have no prior knowledge. Plus with what you save in fees can easily recover that $16. Plus services like coinkite or the bee card stop this double spending  problem.

You don't understand what I'm saying. What you said is right. But there are still large amounts of bitcoins and dollars held in an exchange. If I deposit $10,000 to buy bitcoin and I find a seller and withdraw bitcoin then the exchange no longer holds the bitcoins and if the seller withdraws the dollars then yes the exchange holds none of that. But if I deposit $10,000 and set my bid price to $500 and last price is $700 then that money just sits there in the bank. If I am a day trader and sell for dollars I then hold to buy back in bitcoins. Every exchange will always have large amounts of both bitcoins and dollars on deposit. I guarantee it. Just look at gox and how many bitcoins where lost. The only reason that happened and went unnoticed for so long  is because there is a large amount they held. There is a reason why even with bitcoins an exchange only keeps less than 10% in a hot wallet. The rest in cold storage, because until needed, it just sits there. 
Now a Canadian exchange is unlikely to attract huge amounts of capital. But if you have an exchange that can and it uses banks and currencies where high interest is obtainable. Then the exchange can make money based on this reserve.

lol. Well I'm not making paper wallets and double encrypted USB keys. But I'm more than glad to keep all my bitcoins on wallets on my computer with double encrypted back up the the cloud. Sure coinbase is nice and I have used it quite a bit as a mobile wallet. It's not a bank and I trust my self with my money enough to stay true to bitcoin and hold it my self where I'm not begging for someone trust. 
That and online anyone can get it. Web wallets are probably the wallets most prone to theft. It is the thing that can be accessed anywhere, meaning anyone could potentially get into your account. With electrum they need to get into my computer first. Not a website available to anyone in any country. A Web wallet is like exposing the keys to the world with a password on them where a desktop client is only exposing the encrypted keys to yourself. 
That being said though, I remember when CoinKite launched. A wallet that charges a fee and you don't hold the keys? People wondered why. They responded by saying. Yeah, but most people, their computer isn't secure but our system is. We are there to protect you from your self (to paraphrase) so is Coinbase and the likes great For the noob sure. But they need to do more to make a system secure, they must enforce 2FA at least by text. They must have security questions and block several sequential log in attempts. If not they aren't helping the user only exposing them.

@_date: 2014-10-13 15:40:19
If you want absolute privacy then you still need to mix. However an HD wallet makes it easier to achieve privacy. If for each transaction you use a new different address and then after the address has been used you never use it again then you greatly increased your privacy. An HD wallet makes it far easier to do this as you don't need to back up keys all the time and you can rely on just one backup.

What specifically? Black listing coins. Yes that possible and [has been preposed]( but would be a bad idea
As for chargebacks. Horrible idea. That means giving an authority the ability to reverse transactions so that is entirely against what bitcoin represents. It centralizes it. What we need instead is trusted institutions to have good security practices and offer insurance for deposits. This means the non techsavy people can hand their bitcoins over to them as the company is more secure than they are. The users who want their full freedom will simply store their bitcoins locally independent of an institution.

I don't get it. It sounds like just all built on top of bitcoin. Smart contracts, colour coins, we know about this stuff already. This isn't an altcoin though. Altcoins are capable to redesigning the very basis of the block chain not building on top of it. Unless there is some way to introduce a different hashing  algorithm or block times and rewards within bitcoin then a side chain sounds like a fancy new term for stuff we have known of for quite some time.

From my understanding as long as it is under $10k then it is legal. Anything over wouldn't be. In the US any transfer above 10k must be reported to FinCen, [this is why those guys in Florida got arrested for selling bitcoin.](    (since you don't mention your country of residence I presume this makes you American, so that's a useful link). One of the charges was selling over $10k worth. Canada has similar law with same $10k requirements. So presumably if it's under 10k it is legal in both countries. Now if done through a bank transfer for example then the banks do the reporting. So in that case maybe it becomes defined as legal but it's sure under the spot light and attacks extra scrutiny. Would look into it more, I'm just speculating and don't sell to anyone who mentions using it for illegal activity.

@_date: 2014-03-05 01:57:32
The cash register. When you buy something in Canada the store lists their price. There is then a federal sales tax and then a provincial sales tax on top of that tax. So yes there is tax on tax. But the store lists the price  without tax. When you buy they give  you a sub total and then the total (what you pay with tax) 
Surely something like this can be factored into bitcoin purchases. In fact I would assume it already is. Just that if you use bitpay you ask for the total and then get fiat in bank account and pay what is owed in taxes from that. 
With bitcoin it could be easier because you could develop a system where the tax part goes to a separate address so it is much better for tax purposes.

Dam that sounds like bad experience. I suppose corporate policy could play a role but this sounds mostly just like a really bad branch to me. 
Where I come from with hating Chase is a different perspective. I'm Canadian and have never lived in the US or had an account with Chase. I still hate them, I seem to quite hate all the biggest banks in the US, maybe Chase just stands out because it is common to see their branding  on POS terminals here in Canada. Really though I hate them because of the discrepancy between a good bank and a bad bank.  
I'm big in the [direct banking] (    scene (so yeah I deposit cheques by taking a picture of them) , I do all my banking online so I'm more than happy to use an online only bank when it offers better services and I would never consider getting all banking products from one bank as I am served much better by not and I have spent some time looking up banks in different countries out of curiosity. In Canada the big 5 banks all offer 1% interest on deposits so long as balance is above $5k. The highest interest rate on a savings account is 3%. So this is a increase of 3x, or 300% more interest. USD offers worst interest rates but it's more about the discrepancy that stand out. Chase (as I mentioned before) their highest rate on a savings account is 0.1% and that requires you to have $25k min deposit. The highest interest rate in the US is from Synchrony Bank (available nationwide and is FDIC insured) at 0.95% interest and only requires a deposit of at least $50  to get it. Bank of America's highest interest rate is 0.03%.  0.03% vs 0.95% means an astonishing discrepancy of 32x (rounded)  or expressed in percentage 3167% discrepancy. 
That is why I hate Chase (and BOA, Citi, Wells Fargo),  because they are profit raping scum who doesn't give two shits about you. Also I see Chase listing overdraft fees at $45 where BMO would charge $5, it's ridiculous. Not to mention that CapitalOne360  has amazing overdraft where you will literally pay pennies where Chase would charge you hundreds of dollars.

This is a pretty old case (2012) and is one of the only cases where a SilkRoad dealer has ever been caught (there have been very few). It seems that they are just proceeding to sell them now (for a nice ROI). From what I recall hearing about this case they caught him because of drug activity outside the scope of the dark web. After searching his residence they where able to connect him to Silkroad by going through his computer. Simply put, as said, "piss poor opsec". That's the only reason they caught linked him to SR. The guy was probably some over confident twit who didn't encrypt anything. If he took just basic precautions the police never would of been able to link him to SR. It's also worth noting that this was 2012, back then the 24,518 BTC that where seized from him weren't worth $8 million. At the end of 2012 1 BTC was worth $13. Still a lot of money given the amount he had but no where near the amount it is worth today.

The video posted is great. But an other great more technical explanation of how Bitcoin works is found here: 
@_date: 2014-09-29 19:36:28
Does that sound convenient, yes. But just a little food for thought.


So Circle makes you pay the interchange fee passed onto merchants from credit card companies. This varies based on card and the support rep told me its usually about 2-3%. Then on top of that because your using your Canadian debit card to buy in USD you are charged 2.5% on top of what ever exchange rate CIBC gives. 
Now what I do is if I want to buy Bitcoin fast I use Tangerine as my main bank (because they are awesome). Then, I do an Interac email money transfer (something that is supported by CIBC) to my BMO account. BMO is the only big bank with a Pay-As-You-Go account where it is no monthly fee but you pay $1 per transaction. So I send money via an email transfer to myself. This costs $1, CIBC will charge you $1.50. BMO will charge you $1 to buy Bitcoin via Interac Online, I don't think they charge for deposit but lets assume they do. Now the email transfer arrives within 30 min. So if BMO charges you $2 and CIBC charges $1.50, then Vault of Satoshi charges $1.50 for Interac online deposit you paid a total of $5 + the 0.4% fee VOS takes. 
Now with Circle you are paying at least 4.5% fee (2+2.5). This means that for any transaction over roughly $100 dollars you paid more with Circle than you would in this scenario. $500 with email transfer method with VOS would be a $6.98 fee where as with Circle would be at least $22 fee. Not a huge amount, but for any larger sum of money it sure adds up. 
Edit: basically I just wrote this and did a bunch of math to discover you're only going to save a few bucks this way for any practical amount. Oh well... 
@_date: 2014-07-20 18:08:09

This is for the advanced user. The only time the average Joe would never need to encounter multisig is for escrow and for multisig wallets like bitgo. The latter of the two solves this problem by integrating it all together and I'm sure we can find a way to simplify the first part in new software as there are much less variables to include such as only holding one of the keys whose escrow provider takes care of all the back end.

I would suggest using People's Trust TFSA as it is 3%. This will give you $5.92 for the first month alone. Interest is compounded 3% this rate is annually. This means interest on interest. So $2400 averaged out over the year in a 3% TFSA means $6 per month. So it pays for the $4 account and you could also hold the much lower minimum balance in a $4 account. BMO's account for $4 is $1500 and fee is waved. So it works out to be better to hold that in the account as the max possible interest you could earn is $3.75/month on that. 


It is very easy to use Tangerine with EFTs to link several bank account but they aren't the only free chequing account. PC Financial offers wire transfers and Canadian direct financial might too (on CDF's page they list "call CDF for details") [PC lists wire transfer fee here]( Tangerine used to let you only receive wires and for free but I don't see that listed anymore. 
Since these accounts have no monthly fees you can literally have an account at each of the banks. I just find that Tangerine is best for daily use chequing and it is most certainty best for travelling as they are on the [Global ATM Alliance]( they also offer much better exchange rate on USD than other banks and photo cheque deposits. 


They only offer business savings and GICs not chequing account. Their business savings products are in both CAD and USD. Their business saving accounts are far better than big banks. Such as 1% interest on all deposits regardless of the amount and no service fees. 


I'm not sure if they will offer service nation wide though they do with personal products though their direct banking division. But [Entegra credit union]( in Manitoba offers up to 1.6% on business savings and even chequing account for that matter. So if they allow customers for out of province they are something to look into.
Edit: you should also note that unlike other big banks BMO has a  pay as you go account. This costs zero dollars to hold you only pay a buck per transaction.

The way it works is you would do a 2 of 3 multi signature escrow. Essentially when bitcoins are sent to you its not really in your device it's just a private key you hold which grants access to a set of bitcoins which corresponds to it, these bitcoins being the ones assigned to your address. 
Multisig says let's make it so that we have multiple private keys which are required to control funds in one address. You can have it so only some of the private key are required to sign a transaction and not all. 
So with escrow we would have a 2 of 3 multisig, meaning that there are 3 private keys but only two are required to spend the bitcoins. So imagine this. Bob is the seller and Alice is the buyer and PayPal is the escrow provider. Now Bob holds one private key, Alice an other, PayPal the third. So Alice wants to buy a toy train. She sees it, she likes it and wants to buy it. Now there is one address that she sends her bitcoins to. This address is derived from a combination of all three private keys in which only 2 are required. Alice send the bitcoins to the address. Now when Bob sends her the train she can along with Bob sign a transaction together to Bob's other address. Bob uses his private key to sign along side Alice to send funds to Bob. Now Bob has it and it can't be reversed. But what if Alice didn't get the train? Now she calls up PayPal and PayPal says yep, you are right it didn't arrive. Then PayPal and Alice come to a mutual decision to send those coins back to Alice's other wallet and now she has the money. 
Now keep in mind because 2 keys are needed this means no party controls the bitcoins at all but instead at least two of them must come to an agreement to use those bitcoins. This keeps the holding of bitcoins entirely decentralized. This also means if Alice didn't release the funds then PayPal is convinced she got the train PayPal and Bob can agree to send all money to Bob. Alice would get bad feedback for not releasing the funds. This is far different from a credit card's fraud protection as no charge could be made to you after and once the merchant receives the funds he knows it can not be reversed. 
There can be centralized escrows which make it easier for fee collection and auto finalization (where if Alice doesn't send the money once she gets her train after x amount of time PayPal does it automatically. This is the more probable implementation we will see with escrow when dealing with a site like eBay where you can at the least trust eBay. 
You must realize with bitcoins people buy drugs online from anonymous strangers. Something which you would think at no time  you could be confident you won't get scammed. Something where you can't trust the seller. But people do it and with nearly 100% success rate. The only reason for this is because these sites have  implemented bitcoin escrows, in doing so they have created consumer protections in areas traditional payment methods can't be used. 
Also for the in person thing. When a credit card confirmation time is 30 days, it's not a huge deal for a merchant, and multisig wallets also allow for safe instant payments.

Merchants do need to do more to learn that Bitcoin isn't a credit card. Like how the system should automatically verify the transaction, because it can and will only take an hour for 6 confirmations so it's all good. PC Game Supply is an other example. They have all this fraud protection stuff where you need a phone number to order to verify you and then there are strict limits to how much you can buy which  only increases over time as they trust you. It's like someone didn't get the memo that Bitcoin has no charge backs and all these precautions are not only stupid but costing them customers. 
Merchants need to adopt their systems for Bitcoin, they aren't, they take their system adapted to this flawed system known as credit cards and then throw bitcoin into that lump, where it doesn't belong.

Simple. They gamble. 
Circle implements a trust based system where they establish a buyer profile on you. This also serves as a fraud detection system. They have an automated system which determines how risky  of a customer you are. They are going to be taking into account matters like how old is your account? How often and of what volume do you move? How much personally identifying information do we have about you? Jeremy Allaire skimmed over how this system works in one of his video presentations. 
Essentially Circle create a risk profile on each customer which is then used to determine buy limits. This is in a way similar to how a bank determines how much money they will give you without holding period when you insert money in an ATM (though banks often establish this based on credit history rather than account activity). 
Now Circle is just rather lenient with trusting you out of the box with their (I think it's) $500 limit. This is where they gamble. They hope that by doing this they create future customers. They mitigate risk where possible and will bite the dust where they gamble. 
It is also worth noting that Circle is classified specifically under "Money Orders" by Visa and Mastercard. This is why they get charged as a cash advance and any other  associated fees. I'm not sure how that effects charge backs but let's not act like Western Union hasn't had much more lenient transfer limits for people paying by credit card.

Nope tax free. All interest rates I refer to are for tax free savings accounts. In Canada there area two types of savings account. Tax free and non registered amounts. Turns out only something like half of Canadians know this. 
Basically amongst small banks which offer high interest rates a TFSA (tax free savings account) has higher interest. But there is a limit to the amount of money you can put in per year. Though this isn't a problem for me as I won't reach that limit any time soon as I'm sure student. 
Taxable accounts have no limit to how much you can put in. 1.9% is highest interest rate on taxable accounts. You could also get GICs, or CDs as Americans know them. (highest interest rate on those in Canada is I think 3% on 5 year term) How much you lose to taxes though I don't know. So if you have lots of money you might lose out or break even with inflation.

Take that economists. We aren't hording bitcoins this guy can't stop spending them. 
What you want is to Make a time lock wallet. Basically the blockchain will have in it a message that says on such and such day send funds from an existing wallet to an other one. So if I understand right you can have it so you delete the private key of current bitcoins but hold the private key of an other address that after X amount of solved blocks will send the bitcoins to the address you hold. This way you can't spend the coins but it is still yours. Also if someone else gained access to that private key they couldn't take your bitcoins until the time the funds are sent to you. 
@_date: 2014-02-14 13:58:15
So who broadcasts the refund transaction? You do? and if funds where already released then broadcasting that would be invalid and rendered useless?

Government does more than produce money. I like bitcoin because I don't like the crony capitalism that makes up our flawed monetary systems. That doesn't make me libertarian. It also doesn't make me love the government.

In the meantime I am yet to see a decentralized technology that provides safe clean water to the poor family down the street, or gives the poor an opportunity to go to school, who keeps my family alive when they fall ill with cancer, to make it so a mother doesn't need to pay a bill for her new born, who gives me the ability to by food when I loose my job, who  distributes wealth from some guy who makes more money in an hour than I will make in a decade.

I  won't delete my other  comment but I'll just write this. Below are the 3 most notable online banks in the USA for checking account. The links go to the page outlining each banks no fee checking account respectively. 
[Bank of Internet]( this may be best as it offers up to 1.25% interest on the *checking* account (hits rates tab for explanation) they also let you use any ATM and refund the service charge. So you can go mad. Sounds so convenient. 
[CapitalOne360]( I believe this is the only choice for direct banks that offer cash deposits at bank machine. Not all machines though allow for deposits. They do have branch locations in many large cities. Though due to their ING origin the branch doubles as a Café. They offer amazingly low overdraft fees. 0.2% interest in checking. 
[Ally]( also 24/7 support. This bank is more than savings account it has going for it so I recommend others for checking as opposed to it. 
You can also look at connexus but they are a bad option for ATMs as they only refund you for $25 of service charges since they don't have a partnered ATM network like Capital one and Ally. While the US is horrible for savings accounts in general you guys still have some real amazing checking amounts amongst direct banks.

No one controls Bitcoin and that's because no one can. It is decentralized. Like torrents it exists as a network because of peers that what bitcoin to exist. 
This results in a network where no transaction can be blocked or reversed. Everywhere in the world you can receive bitcoin even without Internet. You just need Internet to spend it. The blockchain (the ledger) is unbiased to over user. Funds can not be frozen or put on hold. Bitcoins can't not be seized as long as private keys remain hidden and well encrypted. 
This is why Wikileaks started using bitcoin. It can not be blocked from accepting them unlike PayPal which was forced by gov to stop processing their payments. 
[How Bitcoin Works Under the Hood:]( 
@_date: 2014-04-03 18:35:02
Well it's, yeah, not so straight forward and though to understand. But essentially debt is what backs fiat. To simply the concept look at it this way. 
Banks lend out money though fractional reserve banking. If I put in $200 and you put in $500 then Bob needs to borrow money the bank gives him $600 from our deposit and say we still have 500. Now this create debt. Yet we both still have our money and he gets his. In essence the creation of debt created money. That money being passed around is therefore debt. This concept is explained well in [Money as Debt](
Then also take into account that most of the money in your account the bank doesn't have. It is money that the bank owes to you. So the bank is in debt to you unless you withdraw in cash. But when you buy something with say, a debit card or electronic transfer of sorts, the debt that the bank has to you is then transferred to someone else. Often an other bank.
Then there is the bonds market. Which is [best explained here]( This part I don't even fully get. But from my understanding banks and people buy bonds which then brings currency into circulation. These bonds are a debit owed by the government to the people who bought them. So even the new money that government creates is often debt to others.

@_date: 2014-06-20 03:40:46
Yeah but as bank can also choose not to provide you with an overdraft so that you can not over draw. The only reason why you can overdraw is because in your banking plan there is an agreement to allow for this. And then 95% of banks will screw you on over draft fees. That's why the article said he has half of the debt just to fees alone. AFAIK the only bank in America that does not rip you off on overdraft fees is CapitalOne360. But it seems they wouldn't take him now.

Bitcoin is an open platform. Nothing will centralize it (so long as mining pools don't gain a monopoly) being open is the intended purpose. No one is telling you to use a centralized service. Nothing can or ever will be able to stop you being in control of the  private keys if you want to be. The sad truth though is the majority of the population isn't responsible enough to be in full control of their money. That's why they use banks. That's why they use financial advisors that recommend their banks crappies products to them, because they just aren't ready to take things and put them in their full control.

It doesn't allow for refunds if fraud occurred. It does however stop fraud in its track by requiring multiple parties to sign a transaction. For example I could store Bitcoin on my phone if it gets hacked they are gone (assuming there is a keylogger or its unencrypted). With muli-sig you could say have a hardware wallet that stores 1 key, a wallet provider with am other, and your phone an other. In this 3 of 3 muli-sig example to send money I need a signature from my hardware wallet, then I need to whip out my phone and use it to sign a transaction. Then the wallet provider can have fraud prevention software that detects certain patterns and has a preset limit to say only sign if transaction is below X amount of Bitcoin and is happening below Y's frequency of transaction. Now it becomes sort of hard to fraud me when you need to steel a hardware wallets, hack my phone, and hack a wallet provide which may very well be like trying to hack a bank.

From how I understand it it is free if you buy with ACH. If you buy with Credit card you must pay credit card processing fees, this is something outside of Circle's control they pass those fees onto you. In addition to this some credit card issuers may charge you cash  advance fees.

You can buy prepaid MasterCard or Visa, not sure which BTC-e support or if they support both but they sure don't take any other credit cards so only get a Visa or Mastercard, look it up on BTCe. You should be able to buy one at any gas stations or convenience stores. 
Keep in mind that these cards are used for people mostly just to buy stuff or as a gift card. Like buy a $20 card and use it on eBay. You then need to register it online on the card issuers website. But like any credit card you can also add funds to it though services that support this.  
Most exchanges that allow for the withdrawal to credit card require verification. But BTCe doesn't give two shits about AML/KYC so you can sign up easily and deposit coins then trade for USD and withdraw to credit card. Keep in mind though that because of use of prepaid card something could go wrong and you might be screwed. Minimum withdrawal with BTCe is I think $800. So look into it. After you buy the card call up the provider and check if there will be any conflicts about loading it with a few hundred dollars this way. (I don't think there would be though) 
If you are travelling to the US though you can fund Gyft with bitcoin and you don't need the physical gift cards because you can just use their app.

He summed up the blockchain. I like how he used the analogy that it is more anonymous than your bank account but less anonymous than cash. He didn't explain private keys. The senators don't seem to understand where bitcoins are stored or how. Though there are 5 videos and others explained it a bit more, though I don't feel that concept of private/public keys for dumbies ever got though to them. The professor explaining has never actually bought anything with his bitcoins which where only offered as a gift to him. He's a researcher not a bitcoiner.
One of the senators also seems sceptical of regulation and as something that may stifle innovation with bitcoins.

Thing is it is publicly owned and it is your ignorance and lack of information which is exhibited buy your inability to determine who owns it. 
Here's a brief history for you. 


See private then 2 years later thing changes. 


Pretty impressive it only took us two years to figure out how evil they are. 
To this day it remains what is called a crown corporation. This is what you call state owned corporations in Canada. Examples of this would be Hydro Quebec a state owned electrical company which by the way sells a good number of it's electricity to the US. Crown owned comes from our roots with England. For example in the US if you commit a crime the DA prosecutes you. In Canada your say the crown prosecutes you. This term is due to how we sill technically exist in what is called a constitutional monarchy. 
To this day the Bank of Canada operates as follows. 


So in other words. It operates separate from the government while being owned by the government. This happens as it is a corporation yet a corporation owned by the government and it lacks share holders. For the reference the minister of finance is an elected official which was voted for by the public and then  appointed to his position by the prime minister. 
Please, if you're going to go ahead and talk about something like you know about it then maybe you should.... 
Sorry. And by the way that socialist comment cracked me up.

We already see Fidor Bank partnered with Bitcoin.de. A partnership like this could allow for stable banking relations and a smooth back end for handling fiat transaction.

Well think about it. Even if it took you 5 days to transfer money to exchange you buy it once it is received in your account there so you didn't experience any of that volatility over those 5 days. The moment you buy to send to the other exchange. It then takes 30 to 60 min to confirm based on their policy. You then trade for fiat immediately. So you only experienced 30-60 min of volatility. Looking at bitstamp prices now the daily range is $430.61 - $442.75 or $12.14 so that's over 24 hours. Given that you only expose yourself to that for 1 hour that's not much risk unless gox starts going under while you are doing it.

For starters Nvida graphics cards are the worst of mining. Any ATI card will do leaps and bounds over an Nvida card. 
You would want to mine with a pool, your don't have some million dollar mining operation so it's pointless to solo mine any coin. The bitcoin will go to the pools website and you will have a withdrawal option to an address you control from there. 
Due to ASICs GPU mining Bitcoin is pointless. With such massive increases in difficulty you are guaranteed to spend more money  on electricity than you will gain in Bitcoin. 
As a result of ASICs GPU miners moved to Litecoin, now with ASICs coming to Litecoin GPU miners are starting to leave that. I think lots have moved to Vertcoin. This will allow you to make more bang for the buck as you are only competing against other GPU miners and not ASICs. Again you are loosing out on a lot of performance because you don't have an ATI graphics card.

It should be noted that FINTRAC has perviosuly said that money laundering laws as are do not apply to bitcoin. Yet just encase bitcoin services in Canada such as the exchanges and ATMs have been fallowing the money laundering laws as if they apply to bitcoin. 
My take is that most probably what we are seeing is government making it so laws do apply to bitcoin. I don't see much changing.

When you send money by credit card to someone though PayPal you pay the credit card processing fee. It's not free. So effectively credit card in this case is more expensive than Bitcoin even with the 1% fee of Coinbase. And who's to say that you won't be buying with Circle for free in the future?

Credit unions still charge fees AFAIK direct banks are the only no fee banks. A direct bank is an Internet bank. They don't have branches to staff that saves them lots of money they pass onto you. They then team up with a nation wide ATM network so it's free to get cash. This let's them offer service across the whole country for free. You never use branch service but instead online banking so why pay for branch service you don't use? There are also some credit unions year operate on this model.

Canada can refuse. We make our own laws. what a constitutional monarchy means is that the monarch is limited to what they can do by the Constitution. In this case that is effectively nothing. Our government has a mind if it's own.  Yes we have a Queen (even though most Canadians don't like the idea of that) but she is powerless. Just a figure due to our history. 
What happened is the 13 colonies wanted independence but at the time the British occupied Canada and the 13 colonies. So America became independent and Canada didn't. People from the 13 colonies who wanted to be part of Britten still came up north to Canada. They are referred to as the loyalist. Over time both Canada and the UK wanted independence from the Queen. Canada is now a separate country. Though not that old, I believe back during WW1 we where actually still part of the UK if I remember my dates correctly

We live in a global economy millions of dollars are moved around all the time by big banks.
The problem is how many people you withdraw to. The system described above is to make a transfer of a large sum to an other institution. Something that isn't hard for banks to handle.

It's probably from fees. For example if I deposit 1 BTC into an exchange it will be held in reserve. The blockchain will say that the exchange has 1 BTC. Now if over course of a few or several trades (even if when I withdraw I wound up with more than my initial deposit) it is possible that I will have paid 0.03 BTC in fees. This means that the exchanges balance book has me listed as holding 97% of this original value and therefore the reserves hold 103%. It would make perfect sense and finances would be completely in order with no foul play.

In short, Bitcoin adheres to its rules simply because everyone that comprises the network also adheres to these rules. These are rules written into the software. If a few strayed from the herd and said let's have 48 million coins instead is 21 it wouldn't matter because they are the minority. If not everyone runs the dame software it's okay because it is similar enough. The network remains strong. A hard fork means getting everyone on board to agree to a new set of rules so that changes to the core of Bitcoin can be made. Changing the max block size to solves scalability issues is crucial. One day we will likely see the Bitcoin network become too decentralized to have a hard fork as not everyone can agree easily. Imagine if every cellphone was a node? Try and upgrade all of those, good luck. 
A hard fork refers to a fork which is planned in intentional, soft fork would be by accident.

That's never going to happen. SHA256 is far easier for computers to hash. Scrypt requires memory. No doubt they wont be ASIC resistant. These coins are designed for ever increasing computing power to be used to mine them. Be it litecoin, vertcoin, yacoin or whatever if any gain success they will have ASICs or something like it as it is part of the fundamental design of the blockchain.

People go ahead and say, well how could Bitcoins market cap ever be greater than Apple's $568? They forgot one thing, that Apple's market cap is denominated in dollars, a currency, not a stock. As you mentioned above the NYSE has a  huge market cap. In fact, so does the US Dollar. So it's not unreasonable to think that Bitcoin could have a larger market cap than Apple because Apple stock isn't a global currency, when was the last time you paid for a coffee in a denomination of stocks? Maybe one day, we'll be quoting the market cap of Apple in Bitcoin.

Either calculate how things work with a rebalanced portfolio looking up historic data or look up pre-existing mutual funds and see how they preform. 
A portfolio of 60% bonds does beat out inflation. Yes it is a conservative investment and by all means I agree for retirement that is a high allocation of bonds given most people investing for retirement are probably looking to retire in 20+ years less than 20% bonds would be a the way to go. But bonds are about vastly reducing volatility if you are looking for a shorter term investment without taking on a lot of risk it is a must have. 
Also look at a good bond ETF during 2008 to 2009. You'll see the S&amp;P crashing like mad down maybe - 50% or so. Meanwhile look at an ETF like ProShares Ultra 7-10 Year Treasury (NYSEARCA:UST) during that period of time you see increases of 20%+ while all equity is failing around the globe. So if you rebalanced in 2007 you are fucking happy that in 2009 your portfolio has mostly recovered vs being down by quite a bit thanks to a 60% bond allocation.

Idk if CBD just gets defined as legal because it's not THC. Also where would you be able to get just CBD? The only easy way to do it is to get it in a substance also with THC. If also using chemo along canabinoids then THC serves a purpose as it induces hunger. Arguably it has benefits as well. Plus having a host if other canabinoids that are usually found with it may be beneficial. No doubt for those who want to abstain from the psychoactive effects of THC by all means CBD is great.

I always figured the network was able to authentic that you have a certain balance of bitcoins by matching the signature of a transaction to the public key therefore proving you hold the private key. But if the address is strictly hashes of the public key then how does this happen? Is the public key ever exposed to the network. Is there something on the blockchain linking public keys to addresses? 
@_date: 2014-01-30 20:10:22
basically you normally have a private key in a qr code unencrypted. If anyone gets your paper wallet they can get your bitcoin. BIP38 encrypts it with scrypt. So now you need the paper wallet and a password to spend the bitcoins.

You know Coinbase, Bitstamp, BTC-e all mix coins? The reason isn't just privacy but how it works. 
If they are a hosted wallet they need a certain percentage of Bitcoin in cold storage for security reasons. This cold storage is 90%+ of all Bitcoin held in the site. So this means all bitcoin received by the site will be pooled together and since only a certain percentage is in the hot wallet that is what you get when you withdraw your deposit. So not only does it add privacy but is a necessity, it would be extremely difficult to insure you get the same bitcoins back as you put in for such a service particularly those offered by end exchange. 
Where things become illegal is if there is a law passed that says you must have strict KYC to do this. Many of these companies already do but under something  like Lawsky's licenses then any website that mixes would need to report to the government about users activity. Again, still not illegal if the company complies. Currently there are no laws on the books that says a website dealing with digital signatures counts as a money transmitter, so not illegal unless you do something illegal with the bitcoins later in the future.

If Alice sends bitcoin to Bob because of the nature of Bitcoin the whole world can trace that transaction and it's existence can not be erased. This presents privacy problems.
A tumbler (aka mixer) pools together a lot of Bitcoins. So now Alice can send her Bitcoin to the tumbler, Joe, King, Meyers, and Miller also all send Bitcoin to this mixer. Now Alice tells the mixer to send Bitcoin to Bob. Bob receives a bit of bitcoins each from Joe, King, Meyers, and Miller. Alice's account is deducted and her Bitcoins where sent to Joe, King, Meyers, and Miller. Now there is no clear link between Alice and Bob.
That's the simplified version. Essentially, you put in your Bitcoins, and get out someone else's Bitcoin so there is no trace between A and B.

I use Authy. They have it set up well so if you loose your phone you can get all your codes back, but yes you need access to your email. 
This is where Gmail shines. When you enable 2FA you have several back up options for if phone is lost. You get 10 one time use codes you should print out and keep. I believe you are notified if they are ever used. You then also set up back up phones, this supports land lines also. So they can text your phone or call it and tell you the code to log in if you lost your phone. 
Both outlook and Gmail and I'm sure others let you check a box saying don't ask for codes on this device so it's not a problem if you loose your phone as long as you don't clear cookies. Outlook also offers a backup code to print out. 
May services have these back up codes, if not write down the key when you set it up. 
Also for the push problem some applications support 2FA so you can just copy the code in and say don't ask again on this device. If the application doesn't support it then you can set up app specific passwords. Essential a random alphanumerical password that only that app uses and remembers and you don't use for login. I know outlook supports this.

You can fund BTCe with Okpay last i checked. Ukash would be an excellent system as you can get it anywhere but I am unaware of sites that take bitcoin for it. You are capable of funding Okpay with many different services. You do need verification to use some aspects of Okpay. I once funded Okpay with CashU (different from Ukash which isn't accepted in okpay) and then used Okpay to fund btc-e but it's still high in fees, no verification required though. That and I used pcgamesupply to get the CashU which takes a fee also but it would allow you to buy with credit card or PayPal.

It's just modern economic theory to say deflation is bad inflation is good. The idea is that if your dollar devalues you buy more because it's not worth holding. If your dollar rises in value maybe you hold it longer, this discourages spending. It also makes it easier to pay back loans (should your salary increase to make up for inflation).
There is much to dispute this and we can't really compare that much because there isn't really any examples of an economy facing high amount's of deflation. Japan has been facing some periods of deflation for [quite some time but by less than 1% typically]( Then look at your computer. Technology is the only thing in every country that constantly is deflationary. That kinda tears apart the argument against inflation. Why did you buy a computer now if I know in a year there will be one that is way better and costs less? We still buy them. 
The whole deflation is bad and inflation is good is largely just a cat and mouse game played by those who have the power to print money. Is it really the case, is inflation really good and deflation bad? Maybe, maybe not, only time and experimentation will tell, and a social experiment is what Bitcoin is.

I don't know the whole banking situation in States but in Canada you can send an email money transfer 24/7 it will take no more than 10 min for the person to get it. No need to worry for holidays and business hours and there is no holding period in the funds. There is a limit to the amount that can be sent but $3000 isn't a problem.

No. They have been keeping business as usual. Except for on the mortgage side of things. They have been owned by Scotia for a little while now. They are actually rebranding it as Tangerine and will be offering  a credit card as of 2015. They are even changing from the exchange network to Scotia's ABM network. They still offer better savings accounts than Scotia and chequeing is free and pays interest. 
They are still much better than all the big banks (except for their horrible GICs) but when it comes to high interest rates other direct banks beat them out. Specifically Peoples Trust  (3% on TFSA) or Canadian Direct Financial (2.25% but no Québec service)

Yeah I knew this article was retarded the moment they mentioned Gox. Gox in no way compared to adequate cold storage the ETF would require. I'm not sure how they would go about auditing the ETF though. Sure you can post the address publicly and sign it to prove it is the right one. That's not an issue, but how can you be assured that  control of the private keys is maintained and that that it isn't lost. How can you prove that the private keys held are the ones that correspond to the address without exposing the private to an auditor that could just go and take a copy of it home on his cell phone (something that can't be done with GLD).

What's a block that isn't necessary for verifying transactions. All blocks are and the network builds on the security of the previous blocks. Unless you mean block not necessary for me as the end user. But that would be problematic as it then disrupts the ability to have every transaction since the being for being easily recorded and redistributed. Something vital to the network.

Trying to regulate software with a Bit License is a bit like trying to say you need to pay Adobe to use their software, meanwhile Bittorrent exists. You can't get software to comply with law. You  can make it illegal for a person  so use, but no one will give a shit... And truth is the dark wallet team doesn't give two shits about the law. Bit Licenses will effect large legitimate business, it is powerless against a peace of decentralized software that runs independent of a company.

From my understanding it only applies to company's or third parties processing  a transaction on your behalf. So if you use something like BitPay you will be fine. I don't know if it would apply to you if accepting bitcoin independent of a third party (should you then be defined as a company transacting in Bitcoins) but I'm assuming you'd be good.

Just a way to fix the maximum block size. Currently the maximum block size is 1 Mb. This means a transaction limit of 7 transaction per second. To put that in perspective PayPal handles about a 100 transactions per second on average and about  Visa 2000 (and maxes out in a stress test around 40,000) . You can't just have an unlimited block size though because then spam can be included in it and you wouldn't want a random block of 1 GB suddenly popping up. 1MB every ten minutes sure adds up quick so you can't have it be too much. The discussion is only revolving around this. How to fix the max block size. Do we simply raise the limit? Do we create a sort of dynamic system that changes the maximum amount automatically based on the daily transaction volume? Or similar, and then, how to go about implementing this and coding it.

Given that UK bank transfers are instant. Does this mean it is instant or does Coinfloor manually need to process the payment? 
Think. Instant withdrawal is huge. For example in Canada you can buy bitcoin for only 0.4%  fee instantly with Interac online on Vault of Satoshi. Coinfloor sees bitcoin trade for 3.9% higher (current price). With their 0.35% maker fee **this means anyone would be able to send money near instantly  to the UK from Canada for a 3.15% profit** from arbitrage and it would only take a total of 30-60 min (buy bitcoin instantly but you must wait for 3-6 confirmations depending on exchanges policy).

As for Neo I think they are the most valuable stock available (in respect to the potential of the company). But that being said stock rising 50% in a day for a company that still turns no profit? I'm not sure if that will hold out for long. Can't say its over valued but there is reason to suspect that prices wont stay as high as they are now. But hey you never know it could go up an other 200% and we thing find out the true value is 70% of what it is now when the market corrects. Its to early to tell but makes sense to be sceptical that prices will stay that high when they rise that fast

For starters it's designed so it can't be stopped now. But Satoshi had good reasoning for this. 
You need to give miners Bitcoin to incentivize  them to mine. When the block reward doesn't exist then transaction fees will provide miners this reward. Currently though there is not enough transactions taking place to be able to allow for a low fee and still give miners the reward needed. 
Right now one transaction with Bitcoin costs $25 but you only need to pay 5 cents because the block reward subsidizes the transaction. Satoshi knew Bitcoin wouldn't take off over night so this is needed for now. Then over time as Bitcoin grows hopefully more transactions will be fulfilled per second and this can then mean that at this point in time it is safe to stop the blockreward and even low transaction fees will be enough to incentivize people to continue to mine.

I very much doubt that the entire Internet will get cut off from the guys who invented it. Mind you places may want to subvert the US (Brazil wanted to build their new Internet lines by routing traffic around the US) and people  boycott US services. 
If by some miraculous chance one entire country was to be disconnected from the Internet and still have a domestic network intact then the Bitcoin Blockchain would effectively fork. The USBitcoin and the WWWBitcoin. One network of miners would make up the full hash rate. The other their respective network. Past transactions should remain the same but future ones will be different. Only if you control the keys though. 
So for example if the US had different Internet from Europe but when you acquire the Bitcoin unless they where mined after the splitting date then you would own a US copy and Europe copy given that it's the same keys. You could  then arbitrage foreign blockchains.

It's vastly different. The banks stop cash withdrawals because they don't have the money. If everyone tries to pull out the bank will collapse. This is how unstable the system is. Most money doesn't exist. If you can even argue that any does. 
With a bank they trade around each other debts. And IOU  of currency. That's what a debit card payment is. When you withdraw cash you cashed out that IOU for cash. But if everyone does that the system collapse because there is no where near enough cash out there. For the system to be stable while everyone pulls cash out the bank would need to be holding cash for all the money you have in them, they don't. (look up reserve ratios) 
With bitcoin you can control the money. With banks they trade IOUs to different banks and accounts. With bitcoin you trade the real thing. The system is more stable. With fiat we accept the IOUs as it is easier to trade because they are sent digitally. With cash you can't send it online. With bitcoin now you have the real thing, not IOUs that can be sent far easier than bank credit (IOUs) so why accept and IOU if you can accept actual bitcoins? 
People will accept bitcoins so we won't have one pulled over on us and the system is more stable because it's not based on fictitious lies that your bank has your money.

No, its free with the same banks ATM. Where do you bank? If you are paying a $1 fee with the same bank then that means you are with a big bank that has a limited amount of transactions on your plan and if you surpass that amount they charge $1 for each transaction there after. You should never be paying a fee to the same banks ATM, TD account on TD ATM is free, Scotia account on Scotia ATM is free.

It has nothing to do with that anyways. This article is not comparing fiat currency to bitcoin it is comparing businesses, their branches, and employees responsible for other financial services (such as investment and financial advisors) and that operating cost to Bitcoin. Having a branch on every street sure does take up a lot of expenses. I pointed this out in other comment but to illustrate my point. Bank of America has 50 million customers. ING Group has 48 million. Yet Bank of America has almost 3x the amount of employees and thus more expenses. The reason? ING Group operates in many countries with no more than just a headquarters under the name ING Direct (their online only no branch baking decision) this bringing  them more in line with a Bitcoin style business, Internet banking only. When you operate like ING Direct or shall I say  Coinbase or Bitcoin as a whole (online only) then obviously your carbon footprint is less when your company is a website.

PGP/GPG is a type of public key cryptography. 
Basically you have a private key and a corresponding public key. You can then take someones public key and encrypt a message (or file)  to that public key. Once encrypted the message can not be decrypted without the corresponding private key. This is useful for sending contents as if you where to encrypted something with a password you would then need to send them that password. This password could then be intercepted. With PGP anything that is intercepted is useless without the private key of the recipient to decrypt it. 
PGP also let's you sign a message with that private key, much in the way bitcoin let's you sign with a private key. You write a message in it and it is put in between a block of numbers, letters, and symbols. This makes up the signature. You can then compare this text to that users public key to see if it matches, if the slightest change was made to the text even if it is just adding a space the signature won't match up. This is useful to confirm that it is indeed a certain person that wrote that message but also to confirm that the message hadn't been changed. 
So it's a way of encrypting and/or signing messages

Even then it's irrelevant to Bitcoin. Sure people  are more likely to buy if they don't need an account to use a shopping cart but they still needed a bank account, with Bitcoin they still need an exchange to buy Bitcoin, unless you get paid in Bitcoin, even then you need to back up your wallet and what not, may as well be less convenient for the  average user, if someone just want to use Coinbase to be easier, hey, that's an account.

Visa and Mastercard have chip and pin on their credit cards all across Canada, Europe, and Australia. Meanwhile America doesn't and is the banks that agent issuing cards with chips+pin (the reason why credit card fraud is about double in the US vs elsewhere. For cross compatibility the banks can do what all the Canadian cards do where it is chip+pin but has a mag strip on the back that can be used for swipe only POS terminals (really only used for people travelling to the states). So really the blame can't go all to MC/Visa when they have developed the tech to mitigate the risk, instead part of the fault is in the banks them selves, but of course they aren't the ones getting  sued. 
Edit: [Actually US will now be seeing more PINs now that Obama is forcing a move in the right direction](  still not as secure as Bitcoin.

Think of the name of just 10 big banks. Each one of them have a higher market cap than Bitcoin. 
Just HSBC has a [$192 Billion dollar market cap](  they hold [$2.7 trillion dollars on assets and $181 billion in equity.] ( 
RBC (which is tiny in comparison) held [$558 billion in deposit in 2011](
While a bank runs a fractional reserve they still have a liability to the depositor. That is that they can't create money without first having base money deposited to them. For a bank to create $1 million dollars out of thin air they must first have $1 million dollars of deposits then lend that out but keep the rest on their balance sheet as bank credit instead of base money. So sure this bank might now claim to have $2 million but they still required $1 million of Central bank base money to do so (more if they have to maintain reserve rations). 
It might be fair to say that many banks don't have $4 billion or more of cash on reserve (after all something  like 90%+ of all money only exists digitally), but any thing that isn't some mom and pop operation most definitely has more than $4 billion on their balance sheet.

So I can take dollars right now and buy on an exchange. Once received by the exchange I can instantly buy those Bitcoin with my dollars. If you use say Circle with credit card you get them instantly. 
Now once received you can instantly send those Bitcoin to an exchange in an other country. Let's say I buy on Circle I could immediately transfer to Coinfloor. Now exchanges only require 3-6 confirmations to be considered irreversible at which point you can then immediately convert to local fiat currency. With a confirmation time of 10 min this means 30-60 min. 
Effectively you only need to expose yourself to Bitcoin's volatility for 1 hour max. 
Now you ask about if they  are sleeping. Surely you can find a time where you are both awake. If not some remittance service could easily make a system where you give your buddy an address and upon sending to that address those Bitcoin are immediately converted to local currency (you know, BitPay style) automatically even if you are sleeping. 
Now there also exists the possibility for exchanges to establish a level of trust between each other that they won't be double spending (a system sort of like GreenAddress.it) where exchanges can trust each other enough to allow for zero confirmation transactions or perhaps just require 1 confirmation then reducing volatility exposure to only 10 min.

I have so many wallets installed. 
If you are looking to store your Bitcoin entirely independent and be in full control of them then use  Bitcoin Wallet. This requires you to back up your keys and make new back ups each time you make a new key. 
If you want a Web wallet use Blockchain.info, they use client side encryption so you never really gave them your Bitcoin. They are very good for managing  different addresses choosing how much of a fee to pay and from what address you have to send it to. They also let you very easily see the transactions on the blockchain so if you are conscious about what type of a record you are leaving on the blockchain this is for you. While they store in their servers they keys encrypted with your password so you can access it if you lose your phone from my understanding they aren't a deterministic  wallet so you'll want to make continual backups in case their server went down. Blockchain.info has advanced security features you may like. 
Then there is Coinbase. This is by far the easiest to use wallet. They pay the transaction fee for you (except for on micro transactions where they force you to pay a high few). They are centralized so they control your Bitcoin but in doing so they also are mixing your coins in the background so they integrate seamlessly with always creating new addresses automatically and you will typically not get the same Bitcoin back when you spend them (this is not guaranteed). 
When it comes to mobile I use Coinbase for ease of use and only to store a spending amount of Bitcoin. Make sure you enable 2FA.

For starters with Web wallet it's that you don't control the funds so you could get Goxed. 
I understand blockchain.info is a bit different with client side encryption. But you need to ask yourself, will blockchain be around in 20 years? They host the file. Also it's a little mor  public. If I have a paper wallet with encrypted private key now you discover my password you still need physical access to my paper wallet. But if it's on blockchain.info if you get my password you don't need access to one specific spot on planet earth. No instead from anywhere in the world using that password your Bitcoins can be accessed.

Coinbase pools together all users funds it mixes them in the background for privacy reasons. Essentially you sent them to Coinbase and Coinbase shoved them in a "bag" along with other users funds then they credit your account. They manoeuvre funds how they want. Your balance and set of transactions on Coinbase are separate from the blockchain. It is Coinbase's own internal ledger that makes up your account. Then when you need to send  bitcoins they just pull a few out of their storage sack. Now this means you are likely going to get different bitcoins, this insures your privacy from prying eyes on the blockchain and means that Coinbase to Coinbase transfers can be made off-chain, thus no fee is paid and you can get instant confirmation.

Where I live water is free, it is a public service paid for by taxes. If it was private then there is no redistribution of wealth and the rich  guy that lives down the street and whose property spans that of 4 streets and is being invested for corruption with government officials (no joke, I'm dead serious about that statement and I don't  live in a rich town) gets to pay for the ability of an 18 year old in an apparent who just moved out an only works at McDonald's to drink and shower. If it was private they would both be paying the same price per liter. 
I don't live in the US. When my mom had cancer and we didn't have $200k plus to pay for treatment then it's okay because we have public hospitals that pay for it. Unlike in the US where if you're lucky enough to have health insurance but if you loose your job then you may very well loose that insurance and it doesn't cover the hobo. Where in Canada it does. So yeah my government does do more than just pay for research. They literally save lives.

So of course is going to jump on a wagon of credit card fees being so high surely this means more people will use Bitcoin. You forget one thing. Credit cards are a credit network. Bitcoin is more like a debit network and thanks to Interac (which operates the debit network as a not for profit) debit card transactions in Canada are ultra cheap. 
[Interac takes a $0.006362 per transaction fee]( Lower than the Bitcoin network's fee. Interac is also instant. Payment processors do slap fees on top of this. While it's common for small merchants not to accept credit cards in Canada in my life I have seen only one that doesn't take debit. Even in small towns that no one passes through they take Interac. 
In 2010 a study conducted by the Bank of Canada actually concluded that due to the costs associated with accepting cash [Interac Debit cards are cheaper to accept than cash it's self.] ( They concluded that assuming an average purchase size of $36.50 a merchant pays $0.82 for a credit card, $0.25 for cash, $0.19 for debit card.

Well okay guess I was wrong on that. I look it up turns out the transaction fee is split amongst the payment processor, the credit card network and the card issuer.
But that asides they make money off of interest, annual fees, late fees, foreign exchange rates, over credit limit fees, cash advance fees, also sometimes certain things they charge interest like cash advance even if it isn't, my credit card if I use it to gamble or certain conditions something like that they will charge interest right away. By giving you easy access to credit also it is easy to spend more than you will have come time the bill is due, so they would make money off of that to. 
Interestingly enough. I looked into how it would compare with debit cards came across this article. Study was conducted in Canada in which they compare the cost of accepting cash, debit, credit. [They found that debit costs even less than credit for the merchant to accept.]( Mind you that's in Canada where we have Interac and you see guys like Vault of Satoshi taking it for instant deposit for only $1.50. Bitcoin has the potential to eliminate all the costs for accepting deposits. So that's awesome.

In Canada a direct deposit/withdrawal (known as a EFT, equivalent to American ACH) is slow, Bill payments are still slow but better. However anything out of Interac/Acxsys which essentially subverts that system is pretty good and at least almost instant. 
I can do an Interac e-transfer to send money between any Bank or credit Union in the country. This can be done as an email transfer or text message (of which both send the receipt a link to deposit their funds). The total time it takes to send money to an other account this way is 30 min. Great to pay back friend (or send money to my other bank accounts quicker than EFT)
 Interac Online (a different product) is instant. This method is used by bitcoin exchanges as it allows for instant deposit.
 Then there is Interac debit cards. We don't really use Visa for debit cards but our own domestic network. The debit network of Interac is operated as a non profit and instant. The Interac debit network has a fee smaller than the Bitcoin network (it's considered cheaper to accept debit card than cash for many merchants). This is also instant from my understanding. Once I sold a book yo a store, they paid me by debit. I went in mobile banking after and it was right there. When ever I buy stuff with Interac I see it immediately update on online banking (unlike Visa taking 2-3 days). 
The US should at least do what our banks started to do, subvert the old slow system and start building a new one. (The biggest banks and credit unions own/operate Acxsys/Interac).

That's mostly true. 
The problem is that someone could send the bitcoins with a fee to the coffee shop. They then send the bitcoins back to themselves with a much higher fee. 
The network should be accepting the first transaction and not the second one but this is not guaranteed. Mining pools may start to favour transactions that have a higher fee. This means that transfer 1 doesn't get confirmed but transfer 2 does. 
**This risk can be minimized by:**
**A**: monitoring the network for double spending to insure that you are indeed the first person receiving  the transaction or that if an other one is taking place you are notified quicker than the 10 min required to solve a block. *Blockchain.info already has this built in.*
**B**: You monitor the network to see how much of the network has heard about the first transaction. The more miners that have heard about it the more likely that it will be confirmed first. *I saw a post on here the other day about mycelium adding this feature*
This is what I mean when I say that people over look this. Fee or no fee the 10 min block time does have its flaws and unconfirmed transactions are not guaranteed

If a merchant doesn't know for months time if your payment is legitimate or not then there as an assumed risk of fraud. When you accept credit cards for a payment this means you know there will be a certain amount of charge backs. This means the price of legitimate transactions must be increased in order to make up the the money lost due to fraud. Fraud is also one of the reason credit card fees are so high. 
If the merchant knows for certain after a period of 10 min that he has your money there isn't the need to Jack up the price to make up for future losses. In return the price drops. Even if you still pay in credit card if a large amount of people pay in bitcoin now it costs you less with credit card as there is less overall losses which must be made up for.

I don't understand the script but basically what you are saying is when my private key signs the transaction these transactions details include the public key. The network knowing this can determine the address from the this public key. Then knowing that this public key corresponds to that address you can look at the public key and compare it to the signature to verify I hold the corresponding private key in order to make the appropriate changes to an addresses holdings on the blockchain. Meaning that yes the public key is broadcasted to the network each time. 
Am I correct in this understanding?

No paper. 
I just got them in QT on my computer. Yep no paper wallet. I encrypt it with a pretty strong but memorable password. Store back ups in the cloud but for added security they are all in a .7z archive with AES encryption of a different password . A name is given to this file unrelated to bitcoin and is saved in the cloud and on USB. 
I then use Windows built in encryption to encrypt the directory the wallet.dat file is in. While this won't do anything extra for malware if someone every stole the laptops hard drive they wouldn't be able to get to the files without breaking that encryption. Only then can they try and break the even tougher password on the wallet it's self. 
I use top notch anti virus also.

A set of words are used which can be processed into a private key. So the moment someone knows those words they can have your bitcoins. Now if your brain wallet is "Livin' in a lonely world She took the midnight train" then it is something someone has thought up before. You can guarantee that people are going up against brainwallets the same way they may dictionary attack your password. If it it something that someone can think up, if it is something that is known, even just typed in a convo on reddit it isn't secure. It is exposed and someone can write a script to generate it just by making several guesses. For instance just changing the above quote to "Livin' in: a lo[nely.... w'orld She t;ook the mi5dnight train3" would make it far more secure. This however still isn't random. 
The only way to have a secure brain wallet is for it to be entirely  randomly generated, just like a bitcoin address's private key which is only secured by the immense improbability that someone else will generate it given its randomness. Electrum does this if you use it as a wallet. It generates several random words which in no way make any recognizable or easy to remember phrase. 
For example a secure brainwallet would look like the fallowing which is a seed from Electrum. This seed is 128 bit or 2^128 which is equal to 340,282,366,920,938,463,463,374,607,431,768,211,456 possible results. In compassion the total possible amount of bitcoin addresses is 2^160 or 1,461,501,637,330,902,918,203,684,832,716,283,019,655,932,542,976 possible adresses.

So, big deal if he's a banker. Bitcoin is an open protocol free for everyone to use. If banksters couldn't use it it wouldn't be a very good currency now would it? There's nothing in the world that can stop me from making a bitcoin transaction and being able to store them independent of government or a bank or let Circle increase the supply of Bitcoin. So I have little reason to be worried about fiats evil hands coming into the game when for the first time in history a financial institution has to compete with my ability to fulfil their role for free. Maybe they will even add immunity to bitcoin from government considering how much  power banks have. 
On the other hand though if a company potentially as big as Circle could be starts implementing coin validation then fuck those bastards.

This was interesting while listening to Canadian Senate hearings. CaVirtex was off calling for regulations. One is the senators comes out talking about how regulation would be bad how it makes bitcoin loose it's roots.  When asked why a call for regulations. The CEO of CaVirtex says. Truthfully, the banks won't do business with us without it. Then take into account how BMO CEO says he welcomes bitcoin if it fits properly into the regulatory framework. Makes for an interesting topic. 
Regardless of what regulators do. As long as you can buy bitcoins and use it to pay for services with ease. You can do what you want. The blockchain can't be regulated. Tumblers exist. Things like dark Wallet will be more wide spread and bitcoiners will make of it what they want most.

How so? The smaller the pools the less probable it will solve blocks. This reduces the miners income since most of the time their computing power doesn't solve a block. If the pool is bigger it solves a large % of all blocks, this means with certainly that the pool will have stable income which it can then divide amongst it's operators. The pool doesn't need to be huge but if it's under 5% and other pools are 10-20% they will surly give you more income.

The guy has 9 million dollars of Bitcoin listed at $300 each. So prices couldn't rise on Bitstamp because people needed to buy up all $9 million worth in order for prices to go higher. 
Think of it this way. If you want a coffee and so do a hundred other people and I walk up to you and say I'm selling this coffee for $1 but Bob on the other hand is asking $2 for the exact same type of coffee. Who will you buy from? From me right. Now if I have a supply of 100 coffees and 100 people buy from me no I am out. I can no longer sell coffee for $1 and since me and Bob are the only two around if more people desire a coffee you are now forced to buy it from Bob at $2. 
So that's what happened. Traders on Bitstamp needed to buy up all the cheap Bitcoins in order to later buy more expensive Bitcoin. While this bearwhale (bear as in bearish,  means downward market, whale means their actions make a big splash in the market) was only on Bitstamp markets fallow one and other and other exchanges dropped as well. If not large arbitrage opportunities would open up between various exchanges. So prices only started to rise after people chewed through all the cheap coins.

I don't think there are any prepaid cards that have a routing number. Many exchanges have started offering the ability to withdraw via Visa/MC not sure if British exchanges offer this. I know BTC-e does this with USD they do support GBP but not sure if that support is extended to this withdrawal option. 
Bitcoin ATMs have high fees. What I would do is use Xapo. If I recall correctly they support GBP so you can just load up your Bitcoin into Zapo and then just spend seamlessly with their Visa debit. This will let you withdraw at pretty much any ATM in the UK and you only pay ATM service fee which will be cheaper than Bitcoin ATM. Xapo doesn't services the US so you will need to sign up once you are in the UK, make sure you sign up for GBP version and not USD version to avoid paying 3% foreign currency transaction fee. 
On a fiat note. Look into Charles Schwab. They are an American [direct bank.] (  essentially they service the whole of the US through the Internet. Their checking account is free with no fees which is the norm for direct banks. So you can keep them as your US bank and avoid monthly fees and minimum balances with what ever back you use now. What is awesome about Charles Schwab is they refund all international ATM services fees and network fees. So you can transfer your USD to them and use your USD debit cards with them to withdraw at any ATM in the UK and it will be free. I think they even pay most of the foreign currency transaction fee so this is actually one of cheapest way to get money while in the UK. Charles Schwab is also free wire transfers so if your send money to Bitfinex for example it won't cost you a lot. 
There are however very nice arbitrage opportunities between American Bitcoin exchanges and European exchanges as  a whole. Even with service fees paid to Coinbase or if you just buy with Circle you can then send those Bitcoin immediately to Coinfloor and sell for GBP to withdraw to UK bank account. Even after fees and expenses you are making 1-2% profit off arbitrage. So that's the best way to send money once you have a UK bank account. Why pay fees to transfer money when you can get paid to do it?

Well any VOIP service in general is useful irregardless of substituting a landline. Specifically for international long distance calls which are much more expensive with cell phones. Also a nice little trick is that if you use a VPN to sign up for a VOIP service and a server of that country you get the domestic rate. For example using Skype to call a phone from US to Australia would be more costly than using a VPN with Australian servers and signing up from Skype there so it thinks you are making cheap domestic calls.

So I get that the way TOR circuit works is that you have 3 nodes. Seeing that each node only knows the IP of the previous and subsequent  node then no IP can be traced as no link exists between all nodes (unless a attacker managed to control all nodes I a circuit, a risk reduced by randomly choosing nodes and constantly changing amongst them). Now given this meeting point is publicised then even though a connection to a hidden services comprises 6 relay nodes does this mean that then each party involved (the end user and the server) only is granted the security of 3 nodes (in terms of hiding your IP, I understand that it's still encrypted)? 
Am I correct to assume that this is the case and that as such a hidden service can be compromised should say, the NSA control 3 of the relays randomly selected  that make up the circuit they could identify the IP of a server temporarily. Am I also to assume that this is short lived as this is only used to establish an initial connection to the server and after that all 6 relays protect the IP of both the end user and server? 
Or am I wrong and an attacker is incapable of accessing the rendez vous point without TOR? And if so that  TOR is required and an  attacker couldn't choose to use only relays controlled by them for their connection to the rendez vous point (since server is choosing random relays I know  attacker can't effect that) and as such all 6 relays protect the IP and the possibility of an attacker to identify a hidden service at all times requires them to control all 6 relays? 
Basically I'm asking if the IP to a hidden service's server is always hidden through 6 relays and as such an attacker must control all 6 to obtain the IP of the server or is it possible for the attacker to (by chance ) only need to control 3 relays that are randomly selected by the hidden services to unmask the IP of the server?

Depends what defines the transactions they would tax. We already tax purchase of good with sales tax (at least hear don't know about UK) that in its self is a transaction with a tax. To say tax at an exchange isn't horrible. 
But to say every transaction that simply couldn't happen and wouldn't work.  It would only be feasible with registered services. If laws start to say tax every transaction  seeing how that can't be done if laws declare that untaxed transactions are illegal then that could effectively make bitcoins illegal to transfer. 
Then again I'm probably miss understanding the situation. I don't know what constitutes a VAT tax.

well the supply will be cut. So if demand was to stay the same for bitcoin at a 25 BTC block reward prices would continue to fall unless demand increased.  With 12.5 BTC reward that trend would happen more slowly. 
Would prices though increase overall assuming continued growth of bitcoin users? Hard to say but if it brings down mining profits miners will have to not settle for low prices to sell. So that could drive up prices unless they cave in to buyers low bid price.

The addresses public key is revealed to the network the moment it receives the tiniest amount of Bitcoin. There isn't much change if you keep signing using the same transaction.

Well the idea is to discourage using them to store Bitcoin. Sure it pissed people off. But I can't really criticize an exchange for encouraging users to do what has been telling users to do this whole time. If you don't hold the keys, you don't own the Bitcoin so don't hold in an exchange.

You can refer to an individual's provincial health card, but only if it is allowed by that province or territory. For example, you cannot use a provincial health card from Ontario, Manitoba or PEI for ID. In Québec, you cannot ask to see the Québec health insurance card but if the client wants to use it for ID, you can accept it.

If none of the banks there serve Spain good enough then you might want to look into ING Direct. ING it's self is a Netherlands based bank but they offer service across Europe and in Australia (they sold off the US and Canadian one). They have a bank in Spain and in UK. 
Basically what they do is offer banking services though the direct banking business model. This means that they are an Internet bank. They offer online banking and the ability to call them while having no or very few branches. This means they don't need to staff a branch which allows them to cover a much larger area and they will often pass the savings on to you as well in the form of zero to low fee banking and higher interest on savings than other banks. 
What they do though is that they have partnered with other banks in each respective county so you can use their ATMs free of charge. I know they offer services in  Spain and UK. So I would suggest you look into if the no fee for ATM access caries over into the other countries they operate in. If so it might be your best bet as they can be used for everyday banking in Spain. 
While bitcoin is often best for transferring between international bank account (specifically not SEPA ones) . Like if you had a UK bank account you fill up for when you go there. But other than that bitcoins aren't necessarily going to solves your ATM problems for quite a few years.

I think the argument really is more about favouring centralized companies functioning in a way to keep bitcoin decentralized. Just look at blockchain or greenaddress.it they provide a service all without having any control over their users funds. The same would exist with a multisig escrow. They could be a company which acts as an arbitrator and takes a fee. But never do they have any control over the users funds in its entirety therefore keeping the protocol decentralized.

Enough good nodes simply means no one controls it and it is truly decentralized. The question is does it act as a hosting platform only or does it act as a market place which once set up regulates it's self entirely on a set of predetermined rules. To be truly decentralized no admin is capable of existing with full control and any change which would be made would require the majority of nodes to agree with this change made by the admins.

We know that TOR can't hide transactions it just hides IPs. So let's get that out of the way not not claim it as a flaw when it was never designed to fix this problem. Transactions can be linked on the blockchain regardless of TOR. 
Now Reading the rest of the abstract it seems they are talking about man in the middle attacks. I don't know how this would effect something like Bitcoin QT as it connects directly to the Bitcoin network. Something like Electrum could face problems here  like how they seem to suggest the ability to double spend amongst the effected users. I assume they mean by reporting false readings on the true state of the network to the client. By connecting to an Electrum server via SSL it solves this risk. 
Now I only read the abstract but this doesn't sound like a huge problem just a friendly warning to those that had false hopes of the anonymity TOR may grant a Bitcoiner.

Discus Fish's model, and one of the criticisms of them is that they purposely limit the size of blocks to be artificially low as it is then harder to accept transactions as less transactions can fit in the block. This means since high fee transactions are prioritize they incentivize higher fees to be used on the network so that transactions remain fast because if a low fee was used then it would no longer be included in Discus Fish's block.
In the end this means more money for the pool as people are now forced to pay higher fees. As other comments said it seems that the block was mined in 1 minute. While target time for a block is 10 min this is based on probability, that out of all the chances there are to unlock a block it will take 10 min on average. This means that sometimes it can be less. I'm under the impression what happened is that Discus Fish's high fee policy in combination with the unlikely probability of solving a block in 1 minutes time combined resulted in no transactions being included in the block as no transactions of a high enough fee where relayed to the pool over this period of time.

 "then prove it. " 
I don't know the specific of the case so obviously it depends but what a cop says they have on you often doesn't always hold up in court.

Basically the way the Tor network works is by passing your connection through multiple nodes which only know the previous peer they connected to and not all others. 
Think of it this way. If from connection X I want to send something to server Y then connection Y and X both know each others IP address. No one is private. So what Tor does is say route connection X through node A then from there to B and from there to C then arrive at Y.
 Now what happens is since each node/peer/connection only knows the IP of the previous no one peer can determine where the traffic came from or went to. Connection Y only knows the IP of connection of C and C knows only the IP of Y and B, B doesn't know the IP of Y or even of X because each peer only knows the IP of the previous. The whole chain isn't known. The longer the chain  the more secure. The less load on it the faster. 
Now essentially the way it works is there is the clear net which is the normal Internet. Then there is the Tor network. Exit nodes are the nodes that bridge Tor to the clear net. Relays are nodes that exist only within the network it's self and can not interface with what is outside of Tor only within it. Essentially they are what is vital to keeping communication secure and preventing a link from being established between nodes. 
Now what happens is that since an exit node interfaces with the clear net and the person who runs it is bridging other people's completely anonymous traffic then everything that passes through the  exit node is traced to it. So if someone tweets American Airlines saying I got a bomb and that traffic passed through your exit node the IP is linked back to you. A Tor relay on the other hand didn't interact with the clear net. It only interacted with other relays or exit nodes. So as such by running a relay node you never expose what traffic passes through you to the clear net as such there is no risk of cops showing up at your door but you still played a role in securing the network. An exit node is really both am exit and entrance to the Tor network. Relay nodes only exist within the network. 
At least that's how I understand it. I don't know the exact amount of rely nodes you would expect the traffic to pass through I just came up with an arbitrary amount for an example.

Bitcoin can be stored independent of the government or a financial institution. Just like cash. But just like cash you can store a wad of cash in a cave for decades if no one knows about it and no one find it it will stay there. You can give cash to a bank also. But if you do and your account remains inactive for to many years that money is no longer under your name. I don't know US law but in Canada this period is 10 years of inactivity the money is sent to the Bank of Canada as unclaimed funds and held for up to a hundred years for the owner (or relative) to claim. 
Bitcoin exhibits two properties though that cash doesn't. You can store the same Bitcoin in multiple locations and you can encrypt those Bitcoin so if someone finds them they can't get your money without the password. 
Bitcoin is really stored everywhere by everyone as it is really just a public ledger. The thing is in order to make changes to this ledger (spend your Bitcoin) you need the keys to those Bitcoin. Therefore he who holds the key owns the Bitcoin. These keys can be managed by apps on your seamlessly in the background. They can also be printed out or saved digitally as a file. Both prints (paper wallet) and wallet backups can be encrypted. Alternatively people give their private keys to financial institutions like Coinbase that really are more like a bank. Algorithms have also been made that allow you to take words and turn them into Bitcoin private keys (this is called a Brainwallet) this effectively allows you to store Bitcoin in your mind. 
So if you store your private keys independent of everyone else and these private keys have passwords on them. Then no one can take your Bitcoin or steel them if you keep these keys safe and secure. 
So if you go and double encrypt a Bitcoin wallet back up and spread it out over multiple cloud storage solutions (eg. Dropbox, box, Google drive, skydrive) and maybe some USB keys. Then as long as you remember the passwords (password for the cloud storage account, for the Bitcoin wallet, and for the encrypted container that conceals it is Bitcoin your are hiding) then no one on the planet can take that money from you (as long as passwords area strong and no key loggers got them) then no one can collect them or move them or anything like that until you get out. As long  as you can get access to those private keys then you have your Bitcoin.

Well if he did Dollars &gt; BTC &gt; Dollars/EUR/wtv then you only need to buy bitcoin the moment before sending it and then sell the moment there is enough confirmations. Depending on the exchanges confirmation policy this means you are only exposed to volatility for 30-60 min.

I don't worry about this. For starters this is going to a different market. It is in no way similar to dumping it on the market with an exchange like you think. 
See if I want to sell 100,000 BTC right now on Bitstamp/Bitfinex if I place a market order I would be eating up the order book and catering to the lowest bid thus crashing the price. Or I could place an asking price of $X for 100,000 BTC this makes a sell wall and  doesn't drive down the price as people must pay X amount of greater. The could actually drive up the price. 
Now an ETF tracks an index (eg. S&amp;P 500) in the case is COIN it tracks the WinkDex which is an average of several Bitcoin exchanges. Now let's say they issue a 1,000,000 shares (making a share worth 1 mBTC). Now when they first start selling the shares they will sell it at the rate of the WinkDex. Only afterwards are you seeing people trade these shares on the open market. So they sell so market rate. They aren't dumping it on the market and they aren't selling on a Bitcoin exchange but instead a stock exchange.

They aren't the enemy but in terms of being a wallet they are a very centralized one so it goes against the principles of decentralization. Some people get pissed off about that. I don't. I see a future of both centralized and decentralized bitcoin services each with their own pros and cons. A diverse competitive market. Some people though get pissed off about that and want to have it all absolutely decentralized. They don't understand that the world isn't and for the layman a centralized bitcoin service is easier and more secure (for people with bad security) for them to get into bitcoin. One thing will never change though and that's that bitcoin it's self remains decentralized. No one can nor ever will control the blockchain and that is really all that matters.

Bitcoin I can store essentially cash, encrypted, backed up somewhere else, have someone else send me some instantly from back home. Alternatively I can even store a seed to an Electrum wallet in my memory where I effectively store multiple balances and change address in my mind.

QuadrigaCX supports Interac email money transfer withdrawals. While Interac is essentially instant (takes 30 min to receive the email) Quadriga must manually initiate the transfer, this takes them 1-2 days to get around to sending it out, unlike Interac Online where it is automated. CaVirtex used to allow this for withdrawal LibertyBit use to use them for both withdrawal and deposits, the later of which lead to their inevitable decline given the high fraud potential.

The goal was offer a brick and mortar bitcoin bank like business. This way you have branch support. Also they would store your bitcoins for you using multisig and making it easy for the public. 
In addition They would offer euro pegged accounts so if bitcoin price fluctuates its okay because you still have the same value in euros all the time. They would also offer time lock wallets. Basically invest 1 grand and if prices fall you still get 1 grand back but if they rose Neo took a cut of profit and you get the rest. This would be time locked, so you need to wait say 1 year before you could get your money back. Like a term deposit (GICs, CDs wtv you want to call them) Then they would have POS terminals in stores with a bee card that you would use to buy stuff with your bitcoins.
All this would be full reserve banking which would fit in to Cypriots distrust of banks,

While many of the people in the testimonies know bitcoin and have a business interests in it they don't know the culture. I was also appalled at BitAcesses inability to answer why the ATM was charging a fee of 15%. They say it's a convenience fee and the senators still don't get it because simply put. It's a monopoly fee. Every city that has a bitcoin ATM has no competition. They are the only ATM in town that is why its such a high fee and they don't understand that. 
Was interesting to see how one senators said he signed up for Coinbase. Confused as to how he was saying they where asking for his bank password.

In short 
Cons: if you lose your bitcoins you lose it, if not exchanging for dollars immediately the value fluctuates a lot which can be a pain, not everywhere accepts bitcoin, improper security can lead to malware stealing bitcoins. Some people may find it hard to use. 
Pros: it's free to send bitcoins as no payment processor is required as it's like cash (didn't go though a bank it went from me to you) . It can be sent near instantly anywhere in the world, no one can stop a payment from taken place. No one can freeze funds. It is independent of government. It unlike every fiat currency can not under any circumstances be counterfeited. Encrypted backups can be made in which you store bitcoins in multiple places at once to prevent loss, this doesn't duplicate your holding it just duplicates your ability to access funds and then there is multisig where more than one person is required to approve if the sending of funds. It's essentially no fees to use.

Pull means that I as a customer provides to the merchant information that allows them to "pull" money out of my account. Push means that the merchant provides information to me that allows me to then "push" to send money to them.
So with a credit card for example if I pay for something online I give them merchant info about my account. They then deduct money from my account using this info. There is no approval needed from me to take money out. This is why subscriptions (eg. Netlflix, Rdio) are easily possible with a pull technique. This same pull is done when you pay in person with credit/debit even if you need to enter a PIN. This is why you hear stuff like Target getting their credit card info stolen as being a problem. This is because Target is storing the data on your card and if that data is compromised anyone can pull money out  your account by using it. This is also why people can skim you card. Essentially a pull technique is like giving your private keys to everyone you pay so they can deduct your account.
With Bitcoin you have your public and private key. No one can take money from me by giving them my public key, only send it. So when I buy something a merchant gives me a public key. This then allows me to take down this information (scan QR code) and push money to the merchant. This also means approval is needed from me as each time the merchant wants money they can't just take it from me as I must manually push it to them. The merchant isn't deducting my account. Instead I am deducting my account and adding to theirs.

Canada Revenue Agency have in the past said bitcoins are taxable.
FINTRAC though have said that bitcoins currently do not fall under money laundering laws and are not under their jurisdiction. Although that may be the case exchanges in Canada have been treating bitcoin as if they do fall under these. 
Reading this vice article makes it sounds like there is a lot of speculation but probably just that government will be given the authority to enforce these laws.Which most companies are already compliant with.
Edit: 
**Text from Government's [website](


The Government will introduce legislative amendments to strengthen Canada’s anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing regime.**












Make online casinos subject to the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act.
Enhance the ability of the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC) to disclose to federal partners threats to the security of Canada, consistent with the Government’s response to the Commission of Inquiry into the Investigation of the Bombing of Air India Flight 182.
To implement these amendments, the Government proposes to provide FINTRAC up to $10.5 million over five years and up to $2.2 million per year ongoing. The Government also proposes to provide up to $12 million on a cash basis over five years to improve FINTRAC’s analytics system. This investment will increase efficiency, improve data quality and better meet the needs of Canadian law enforcement and other regime partners.

I can hold 1 million dollars worth of Bitcoin on a peace of paper encrypted in my house and backed up around the world independent of a financial institution or government and then receive/transact that money internationally with out asking anyone's permission. Try that with a bank. 
Instead the traditional banking system (eg. Dollars, euros) say you must be putting it in a bank to transact it and store it safely since you can't encrypt/multisig/backup cash. Then when  you do put it in a bank you no longer control it instead they do and they just lend it out.

if its blogspot I don't think you can do much more when it comes to SEO as you don't control the site. Tagging your posts might help. Google runs blogspot so they probably have it set up well for SEO.
You can still use wordpress for free with wordpress.com it's a little bit different though than running wordpress on your own server. You only need a shared hosting plan though if you want to run your own site. This only costs a around 5 dollars a month and domains are cheap (12 dollars a year or something) if you want get a .bit domain to keep it with the bitcoin thing. You can pay for some hosts in bitcoin also. 
I'm not sure how you would go over SEO in a CMS but in HTML code it's self there are some things you can do. Like adding meta tags and description. You could always try blackhat techniques but I advise you stay away from those as they could get your site banned from search results. 
I recommend you get active on social media talking about bitcoin, Twitter, Facebook or what ever is popular in your country. Even if it is memes related to bitcoin, you can then link to your website. Try and make a more attractive website also so it's easy to use and people want to come back to view it. Wordpress does make that easier.

We are making the assumption that credit unions are safer as they are less risk prone. They aren't greedy cunts with big payrolls so they are less likely to fail because they are presumably more risk adverse as a result.  [Number 2 on Bloomberg list of world's strongest banks is actually a credit union](  Credit unions also have different insurance deposit corporations than the banks, for what it's worth.

It's a huge sell wall that keeps popping up on Bitstamp. The guy is essentially making an $8 million dollars sale not with the intent of selling but of stopping you  from buying above $300. Call his bluff buy at $300 and he lifts his price sets sell walk for higher price. Currently his price is $319.
This price is low because a whale is threatening to sell a shit ton of coins for cheap. The market is too shallow to buy all his Bitcoin so prices don't go higher and he  sells very few if any. It's opportunity to get cheap coins for anyone who calls his bluff.

What bitcoin has showed me is the approach of an Internet currency where finances are online only has opened me up to online banking. Direct Direct Banks pay the highest interest rates in most countries. These banks are available nationwide as no branches are necessary. For example the biggest difference is in the United States where Bank of America pays no higher than 0.03% interest on savings account but [highest rate form direct bank is 0.95%] (     and requires no minimum amounts to gain interest. CapitalOne360 offers 0.2% on the  checking accounts with other checking accounts going  up to 1.75%. Canadian People's Trust offers 3% on tax free savings account making it the only one in Canada that beats out inflation.,

You entirely misunderstood my comment. 
Yes. I agree that the system is absurd. I understand where it comes from and that the system is a scam so banks (well  big banks at least) can get every dime from you possible. 
I love bitcoin just as much as you for all the reasons mentioned above and in your post. I like that I can hold my funds I'm full reserve and that I don't get charged any fees (not that my bank*s* charge me fees)  
I recognize something though which I said in my original comment that you don't seem to. That's that the general public doesn't think like you. They aren't you and they aren't . Most people have no idea what a private key is. They have no idea how to encrypt something. They use the same password for all their accounts and can't figure out 2FA and sure don't have it on any of their accounts. They still get viruses on their computer and ask me how to get rid of them and pay me money to jailbreak their iPhone even though it takes a few clicks and one YouTube video to know how. 
If the general population can't figure ^ that out. How do you expect them to be able to secure their own Bitcoins? We already see frequent posts of "oh I lost my Bitcoins. I was hacked. How?". 
This is what I mean when I say people aren't responsible enough to be in control of their money. I never said people can't be in control of their finances and be responsible with that. What I mean is to literally be in full absolute control of their money. To be their own bank. This most people can't do. This is why they use a bank as an intermediary and interface between them and their money. It protects them from themselves. 
This is why it is a good thing that banks adopt Bitcoins. First of all Bitcoin would be really horrible if banks couldn't adopt it. But having them adopt it allows them to control their users funds and maybe  even ensure them to give a sense of security and ease. People may not understand Bitcoin overall. But they can understand Coinbase and Circle. 
Also do you know what Fidor does? They are a [direct bank.](  They aren't your normal bank. They are friendly. I don't pay fees on my chequeing account (which even pays me interest) and I gain 3% interest tax free on my savings account (the highest in the country and only account where you consistently do not lose purchasing power from inflation, I'm Canada by the way) the reason is I avoid big banks like the plague and use Direct banks who actually are pretty friendly to me. These guys are not your every day bank and are far from it. ING Direct coined the phrase "Forward Banking" that's what these guys do. And I will be more than glad to see the bank most accepting of Bitcoin take it under their belt. 
I don't know where you are but I'll still use the US as an example because the discrepancy between friendly direct banks and big banks is largest there. To put thing into perspective Bank of America's highest interest rate on saving  accounts are a laughable 0.03%. Chase's highest interest rate is 0.1% (and lower if deposit isn't at least $25k) meanwhile Everbank is 1.01% (on all deposits) and CapitalOne360 (the most known direct bank in America)  offers no fee checking with amazing rates on overdraft with 0.19% interest on their checking  account. Bank of Internet USA's no fee checking  account is up to 1.25% interest and let's you use any ATM and refunds the service  fee while offering 24/7 customer support. 
So no I'm not a shill for banks bit when it's zero fee banks like this that start accepting Bitcoin. Let em at it!

While coinkite sounds great I'm not sure it would ever actually take off in its home country of  Canada. At least not the POS part.
Bitcoin is a debit network. Mastercard/Visa are credit networks. People use credit cards to buy things because they don't have the money now, or for online. But the interac debit card network is very cheap. They only charge a transaction fee of $0.006362 per transaction which is less than the current bitcoin fee. Anything else the merchant pays to the POS supplier and Something that can be compared easily to bitpay fees or what coinkite will want for a POS. There are many merchants that don't take credit cards due to fees in Canada. But they all still take debit. 
So since bitcoin is debit and not credit there is little incentive for merchants to adopt except for online where interac has almost no presence. 
I don't think the joy of mobile payments will make bitcoin big at brick and mortar stores. 
So unless bitcoin's prices stabilize enough that any merchant can just take it on their phone independent of a payment processor in near future. Then the use of bitcoin won't see many merchants take it in Canada other than for publicity or maybe in tourist destinations.

On some countries your can send money between people much like described with Bitcoin. For example in Canada I can log into mobile banking to do an Interac e-transfer. This allows me to send money by SMS or email. Within 30 min the recipient will receive a link to deposit their funds. They click their bank/credit Union it then takes them to their online banking to log in and answer the  security question. The funds are then deposited immediately with no hold. This can be done 24/7. It does cost $1 though and has limited (something like $3000 a day). It's great because it bypass the rest of out banking system which is slow as shit. 
I have also seen comments by Europe's talking about similar systems in their respective countries. My point is fiat has been able to accomplish this. It just hasn't been able to do it on an internationals level like Bitcoin can.

Rooting does not equal jailbreak. Rooting is &gt; jailbreak.  This is why your area down voted. 
Think of it this way. Android is jailbroken out of the box. You can get custom key boards (like Swift key)  change default apps. Change nearly the entire phones interface with launchers (look up Nova launcher and smart launcher) you can even install a custom lock screen. Can get widgets and allow other apps to control things like whether or not wifi is on or auto rotate, task killers, you name it. 
2 key points here. Almost Everything in cydia are the types of apps that Google would approve in the play store. Even if Google didn't approve it you can still download unapproved apps without rooting. Jailbreaking is just letting  apps be installed that Apple doesn't approve of or allow the use of those APIs. 
Rooting  on Android is completely different. Rooting  is the ability to let apps have root permission (think root as in linux) this is basically admin permissions. Apps that require these permissions are also in the play store (yes google approves them) root let's you do things like overclock your phone, change CPU governors (how the phone decided to scale between different CPU frequencies) install customs kernels and access files you normally don't have permission to. 
One of the big things rooted phones let you do is install custom roms and mods. A custom Rom is a different operating  system. It's like switching from Ubuntu to Fedora. You know why Samsung  and HTC phones have different interfaces and features? Because they are different roms. 
Rooting can be problemic in some cases as apparently don't have access to the app data of other apps normally yet  rooted apps get access to this. This why why roms prompt you if you want to allow root permission. Some apps like authy are designed so that this app data is encrypted. 
You say it is hard? If you have a popular phone and windows you can install cyanogen mod super easily with the cyanogen mod installer (look it up on YouTube)

This isn't something that really has anything to do with TOR per say. For example if Bob sends 0.4BTC to address A which Alice controls, and then Joe send 0.6 BTC to address B which Alice controls and now Alice sends 1 BTC to Lee then Lee can view that those Bitcoins came from both address A and B and subsequently he can now prove both addresses are under the control of Alice. However, this has nothing to do with TOR. This exists irregardless of TOR and no one ever preposed TOR as a solution to this as TOR job is solely to hide IP addresses.

Actually it doesn't cost much to make a Bitcoin at all. If no one else was mining my cell phone would be enough to solve a block every 10 min. But there's competition so I'm forced to buy expensive hardware to compete with the ever increasing difficulty. 
There are two definitions of inflation. 
One is the increase of the money supply. How many dollars were there last year? How many dollars are there now? If it increases there is inflation. 
The second definition of inflation (which our government is so fond of) is that inflation occurs when the costs rise. This is like the CPI, how many dollars does one apple cost today, how much will it cost in a year? 
Currently Bitcoin is considered inflationary under both of these definitions. The value decreases, and the money supply also increases. 
Now if say the GDP of a country was to increase and the money supply was to also increase it is still possible to experience either inflation or deflation because you would be using the later definition of inflation. 
Bitcoin will always experience inflation of the money supply until approximately 2140 when the block reward ceases to exist. However should the demand for Bitcoin increase enough then it is still possible to see rapid deflation. This is something we went through in October -  December where Bitcoin sky rocketed. Just with Bitcoin the increase of the money supply is already known. Unlike the dollar where the Fed purposely increase the money supply when the dollar increases in value in order to reach their targeted rate of inflation. 
You sir are just reinterpretating what inflation means to reassure your confirmation bias that Bitcoin can never be inflationary. When really Bitcoin is inflationary, but it is capable of being deflationary because the block reward is unbiased.

To truly be secure and serve the purpose of cold storage. Yes. 


From my understanding the way CryptoCards work (the sites down I'm assuming its the site i'm thinking of) is you generate the private key your self. Now you encrypt that private key and you send it to them in the forum of a QR code. As such you never really gave them the keys and is still cold storage if you generate the keys offline. You must however have a strong password as you still expose the keys to them to a degree. If it was a card where they generate the key for you (or you sent them an unencrypted version) then nothing is stopping them from keeping a copy of the private key and taking your Bitcoin when ever they want. The idea behind cold storage is to never expose the key to anyone or anything other than the file or peace of paper that is the place which stores it.


Yes you can do this. You don't need access to private keys to receive the Bitcoin or to monitor the balance. You however must have private keys to spend Bitcoin.

Bitcoin does far more than compete against the credit cards a bank offers. In fact comparing bitcoin to a credit card is quite a bad comparison. 
Bitcoin is a global chequing account that no bank or government has a control/manipulation of. It is a global money transmitter and a store of money. It's a currency. Banks are institutions that utilize currency and offer products surrounding it. So no bitcoin is not a bank but neither is the dollar. In many respects  bitcoin does let's me be my own bank no permissions asked. It is an opted out of the global financial system as we know it. A protocol doesn't offer loans but that doesn't mean we won't see a business based upon it do so in the future.

I can defiantly see overdraft being a problem but not sure about this. Given how factional reserves work now days it's more like creating money even if it's held there only for a few days. You can deposit 100 then they lend out 90 but you still have 100 you can use to buy stuff with. Why? Because it is bank credit it's debt that is then traded around. It's digital so it is just created as need. So given this nature of a fractional reserve even if they aren't holding the money for long it is still worth their wild.

Well technically the government is responsible for deficit spending which then requires people to buy bonds and the Fed is always there to buy bonds if no one else does. Then on top of that despite the Fed operating much like a private bank it is owned by the US government which takes most of it's profits.  So to say US government is a appropriate response.

The blockchain is like a ledger that makes up Bitcoin and which address holds what balance. It serves as a record of all transactions that have ever happened. In doing so it allows you to receive Bitcoin and know that they are real because you know exactly where those have come from, who held them previously, and who held them before that. All transactions are recorded since the beginning on the blockchain (the genesis block).
Now each block is sort of like 1 page on the ledger, a set of transactions. Bitcoin's code says that a block has a maximum size of 1 MB (1,000,000 bytes). This effectively limits the amount of transactions that can fit in a block. It makes the maximum amount of transactions 7 transactions per second. To put this in perspective [PayPal handles roughly 47 transactions per second on average, Visa handles 2000 transactions per second on average.](
Discuss fish with a blocksize of 999,999 bytes has essentially just hit this limit. Something that previously wasn't done not just by them or other pools (at least not commonly or that I know of). In addition to this coming at a time that the core devs are discussing how to address the scalability issue Discus Fish is a pool that is notorious for publishing blocks that are smaller than other pools. This restricts the amount of transactions on purpose to smaller than other pools. The reason for this is because high fee transactions are prioritized. So smaller blocksize effectively forces you to pay higher fees if you want your transaction included in the block. Perhaps this shows a change of heart at discuss fish?

His bank is the middle man. Every fiat currency transaction other than cash involves a middle man.
 When I buy something with Visa my bank, Visa, a payment processor, and the merchants bank are all middle men who all take their own cut. When I move money with a domestic payment the money goes from my bank, through a central bank, to the recipients bank which the recipient may then withdraw from. If I wire dollars I am not going ahead taking cash and flying to Slovenia to hand it to Bitstamp. Instead I go through a bank which acts as a middle man, they deal with an other bank, or [several correspondent banks]( that serve as other middle men, then Bitstamps bank receives it. Simply put by having a bank account you introduce a middle man (your bank) and from that other middle men may latch on. 
You can not move fiat  without involving middle men (unless it is in person cash transaction). Bitcoins biggest innovation is that it creates a system where truly P2P transactions can be conducted over the internet with no middle men what so ever, no discrimination amongst transactions, and no unfair fees. This is accomplished by creating a ledger that everyone has full equal access to yet doesn't require trust as users can't manipulate the ledger outside of what the network allows. This is the true innovation of the Blockchain.

That's what bitcoin aspires to be, but it severe other purposes at the moment. For starters it is easy to send Bitcoins with a QR code and for anyone to accept them. I can't accept credit cards near as easily as bucks.

Did you not listen to what I said? I said use Bank of Internet, NOT Bank of America. I hate Bank of America as much as you. Which is why I told you to go to an other bank that charges no fees and gives you a large ATM network unlike your credit union. 
I agree that BOA is fucking scum. They only pay out 0.03% max on a savings account when you can get 0.95% from anywhere in the country from Synchrony Bank. I'm telling you to go to an actually good bank. I told you to use [Bank of *Internet*]( a bank that is online only, that is a [direct bank]( and that pays higher interest on their checkign account than those fucks at Chase, Well Fargo, BOA and CITI pay on their crappy ass fucking joke they call a savings account.
Edit: and CapitalOne360 will charge you pennies for overdraft, it's probably the best overdraft you can get in the world. Not 1 free overdraft, all free only interest paid [which can be  extremely inexpensive ](  their account is also no fees and pays interest, just different ATM networks.

I think his argument there was more that merchants dump them on the market and this drives the pieces down and really that they them selves don't want the bitcoins but the dollars they buy and that no one wants to take bitcoins they just want to sell them when received.

Why would they not be happy? They like the illusion of earning money? 99% of People's savings account have a interest rate out paced by inflation. If your savings account is 1% interest and inflation is 2% you didn't earn any money. If you make no interest but money supply isn't growing from a fractional reserve system then you keep purchasing power. You can then use term deposits to earn actual interest and actually gain purchasing power. It does mean higher rates for borrowing most likely though. Unless banks take a dip in their profit margins.

Direct banks still have awesome chequeing accounts. In US Bank of Internet Rewards Checking refunds all ATM service fees so you can use any ATM nation for free it also pays up to 1.25% on checking. Charles Schwab is free international ATM refunds. I've also heard their wire transfers are free and that they pay some of the ATM transaction fees. US direct banks don't offer deposits though. 
In Canada direct banks do offer cash deposits. Tangerine is member of Global ATM Alliance and uses the ATM network of 3rd largest bank in the country. No fees and they have lots of sign up bonuses. When you refer a friend you each get $50. I've made a total of $175 that the bank has paid me for such things. Only fee for Interac email transfer which is only $1 each time.

I think this can still be achieved with 2 of 3. I understand the risk in that someone could sign a transaction independent of the wallet provider this way. I'm not sure the specifics of multisig but can't you tell which keys where used to sign it? If so then you can have instant transactions by looking to see if the wallet providers key signed the transaction and if so grant the user their money. A 2 of 2 system still works out great. I just don't like the idea of having to wait for a time lock to be over with if greenaddress.It went down which means either waiting  a long  time or frequently putting control of all bitcoins into one private key.

Actually banks don't necessarily run Linux. AFAIK they favour running software written in ASP.Net or similar.

Money as we no it was created from several self interests. At no point in history did a bunch of people start saying hey lets plan out a currency like this. We started trading gold and silver as money. Back then money was not debt. You where giving something of value in exchange for something else of equal value. Then banks came in to keep your gold safe and thats where things started to fuck up. Eventually money became the products of banks an banks along with parts of government shaped the system to where it is today. Who benefited most is the banks, it's a system largely crated by them for them. 
I highly advise you watch all of Mike Maloney Hidden Secrets of money series on youtube which will answer many of these questions. The movie Money as Debt as a linked before also explains the concept well.

That depends. Of the 2.9% or so fee paid to PayPal most of that doesn't go to them. 3 parties are involved in a credit card transaction. The payment processors, the card issuer (your bank), and credit card network (Visa). Each of these parties take a fee. So if PayPal is nice they take their regular cut for themselves and pass on the savings from cutting out the other two. If PayPal wants more money then they will take the same fee and pocket the extra profit. Plus there is no flat fee work Bitcoin on top of that line a credit cards $0.20 minimum fee (which is a lot of you sell something for only $1)
@_date: 2014-07-29 19:15:30
While it's true that work huge amounts of money banks will charge you less in fees you need to realize there is still a currency exchange fee. It also isn't instant, a wire will take you five days. Then that's only if you are sending it to other first world nation. Try sending a million dollars to a third world country and not get charged a fee by every correspondent bank on the way. 
When people say with bitcoin it is free to send money internationally with no fee instantly, they mean while keeping it within the bitcoin system. Even then is some countries fiat is fast so in that case you can send from fast county to fast country and exchange for local currency very quickly.

You couldn't truly have a full node on a phone as the Blockchain would take up so much space you wouldn't have many GB left. Also full nodes can take up a lot of bandwidth and many of us have caps on mobile phones of a few GB a month. The only way to make it feasible is to have it store only part of the blockchain. Really due to storage problem it is probably better to just mine Bitcoin on your phone. These apps already exist. While you can't expect to make any money off it really, you still contribute a tiny bit to the network. If everyone's phone did it the network gets stronger.

So one of the common criticism of Bitcoin is that the early adopters hold a disproportionate amount of wealth. That they got in when Bitcoin was worth pennies and now became millionaires (an opportunity the rest of us didn't have). So it's kind of like talking about how 1% of the US population holds 40% of it's wealth and deeming that unjust and problematic.
Though this argument is largely based on analyzing  the addresses with the most Bitcoin and saying their balance is representative of X percentage of all addresses that have Bitcoin and that therefor Y amount of users hold X amount of wealth. This is an extremely flawed analysis because A) you can hold your Bitcoin in several different addresses and we don't truly know the number of Bitcoiners out there, B) some addresses with lots of Bitcoin hold them on other people's behalf (Coinbase, or even exchanges' reserves like that of Bitstamp), a C) we don't know how many Bitcoins have been lost, because a lot have been. There are plenty of people who mined several thousand Bitcoin back when it took less than a week to do so, they deleted the wallet thinking it would never amount to much even though that wallet is now worth millions of dollars that could of been theirs if they took the effort to protect their Bitcoin.
Regardless. [The argument is still made by some.](
So what I'm saying here, is that over time, things like what this whale did are going to happen. Some guy just sold $9 million dollars worth of Bitcoin at todays rates. But, you didn't see 1 guy buy all $9 million worth, much rather several individuals bought them. So as a result, there is less concentration of wealth amongst Bitcoin holders and a greater more evenly distributed wealth amongst the public as a result.

I'm talking about ACH vs SEPA sort of thing. 
For example in Canada an EFT (our equivalent of ACH) will take me 1-2 days to send between my accounts at different banks. If I want to send money to PayPal this would take up to 5 business days, same go with EFTs in most cases to a business. 
Now I bank with Tangerine (formally ING Direct Canada), my friend just sent me money. I have it set up so he sends me a Tangerine email money transfer and it gets deposited instantly into my account for free without me even needing to click a button. Now this happens because it is a change made on Tangerine's own internal ledger where Tangerines systems (made by IBM) just say -$50 on Bobs account, +$50 on Joe's account. This is instant as Tangerine is reliant on no one but themselves to preform these actions.
Now if I want to send money to PayPal this is no longer 1 ledger where a balance must be changed. Instead Tangerine must do an EFT to PayPal which means my bank dealing with the central bank which deals with PayPal and any other intermediaries that might be involved. This means relying on different ledgers operated by different banks and a reliance on the transfer mechanisms that allow banks to interact with each other. It is no longer under PayPal or Tangerine's control as to how fast it goes.
Now if you look at a country like the UK where all bank transfers are instant or the EuroZone's  SEPA transfers that take only a few hours vs a few days, then it makes a big difference as to how fast PayPal can do their job and interface with the ledgers of banks beyond their own.

I get like 1 buck at least and even then thats because I only have 1 grand in my account. In Canada we are at least lucky enough to have some banks with high interest. Big banks you are talking 0.25% interest on those shitty could be used for daily use accounts. 1% on high interest accounts at big banks. So you still loose out from inflation. 
Then you look at direct banks. With the internet you don't need to have an account at the bank down the street. You can use direct banks. So I have a zero fee chequing account with 0.25% interest and will soon get a savings account at 3% interest rate. (The highest in the country and you gain money instead of loosing out from inflation.) So if you know how to google and aren't brainwashed by advertisements and this notion that you can only have a bank account at a bank down the street when we never visit and use online banking then you won't get screwed. 
But I'm assuming you are in the states though. There seems to be no banking competition there as far as I can tell. That and ING Direct in US got bought out so that got to suck. Those USD 0.8% interest rates got to be a bitch. 
edit: just looked at stats turns out past few years the rate of inflation in Canada is lower than in the US. Got to wonder whats up when you still get lower interest rates.

Manitoba credit unions 100% of the deposit is insured, this coverage extends to people who are none residents of Manitoba. Manitoba has the best credit unions and many of them offer service nation wide for savings accounts and GICs through their direct banking subsidiaries. The highest  interest rate in the country on a non-registered savings account is 1.9% interest. This is paid on every dollar not just balances above 5k like big banks. This is available from Implicity Financial and Accelerate Financial. Entegra Credit Union (Implicity's parent company) even offers up to 1.6% interest on their business chequing account. Think about all the interest a large company could earn with that. Implicity Financial and Outlook Financial are also the best places for 2-4 year GICs. 
All the financial institutions listed above are all divisions of Manitoba credit unions which insure 100% of the deposit and offer service nation wide. 
And yeah CDIC doesn't cover foreign currency also. I believe some credit unions do, don't know which provinces though.

Not the article that came to mind. In fact the one I originally thought of has little relevance to your question though I did come across [this ](
You must realize though that the primary argument in favour of inflation is loans and spending. There is this idea that with inflation it becomes easier to pay off loans because your money becomes worth less and so your income must increase to adapt to this and then you can pay off this loan easily. This is a flawed argument as you must realize that interest takes into account inflation. So a deflationary currency. Or much rather a inflationless currency means low interest rate. There is also then less need or desire to borrow money if you can just save and have more in the future for that very act of saving. This also benefits those with low income. But who benefits from inflation? Only really the financial institutions getting rich from causing it. 
The other argument is why spend bitcoins if I can get more money by saving? But if today you have $50 and soon that gains to value if $100 wouldn't you maybe want to buy something for $75 now?
I'm sure there are better arguments out there. But think why is inflation any good? Do those arguments ever hold up?

Bitcoin its self is just numbers and code on the Internet. It doesn't show it's self to be a store of value. Is this text I write right now a store of value? 
Bitcoin only becomes a store of value when it is found useful as a means of transfer. As a means of transfer there becomes constant exchange between fiat currencies we already deem a store of value. This transfer and demand gives it value. Once this is established Bitcoin can become a store of value perhaps better than the dollar due to the fixed supply (so long as an exchange of Bitcoin for currency or goods and services continues to occur). 
 Dollars themselves are also just numbers in data bases or physical tokens or paper worth only a few cents, but it's usefulness provides with it a demand and subsequently we view that $20 bill is being worth $20 because you will accept it as such despite it's true value only being a couple of cents on paper/plastic/ink/hologram.

Politics is a debate. What is best, what isn't? What the the unintended outcomes of a law? Not every one that makes up the government is a shit head and some do what what is best for their constituents, or at least what they believe is best. Now public commenting means that if they haven't thought of something now you can present it to them. This allows them to reevaluate their positions and have you weigh in on a law makers desire to present their view points in the inevitable debates that formulate the final draft which then becomes law.
 If a politician/bureaucrat doesn't know about something then they can't change it. You can then notify them so that they then become aware of potential issues and can think these issues over for them selves which hopefully means better laws. It's democracy.

The Dow is an index that tracks the overall all growth of 30 very large cap stocks. It tracks the overall growth of a specific US market that acts as a benchmark of the performance of this market . 
This compares to Bitcoin that is more like a scare precious metal where the price is indicative of Bitcoin it's self not several assets that make up Bitcoin. It is not a measure of the strength of the economy but strictly of supply and demand of something that you can have unique to everyone. 
In terms of wowing investors sure the growth can be astonishing. But remember that many companies that make up indexes such as the S&amp;P 500 or Dow Jones out preform the index they are contained in. These aren't excepted to be high preforming. Small cap stocks (eg. Akorn Inc) are. An index is more more levelled out and less volatile than it's holdings however.

You can always open an account at a big bank just for this purpose. BMO has a pay as you go where it is free other than when you use it. If you use often then all the big banks also have $4/m accounts. 
Assuming you go pay as you go then you send an email money transfer to the BMO account which if isn't free for you is $1 then $1 for deposit to BMO and $1 to spend it (deposit) on VoS. 
So this can all be accomplished in 30 min and for $3 plus VoS fee of $1.50 so that's not so bad sounding to me. Works great when you avoid the big banks in exchange for better rates or free banking.

All those patriotic people at the NSA and DOD and CIA aren't there (in their eyes) to destroy your freedom and waist money. Some of them actually do want to protect you. But [168 children killed in drone strikes in Pakistan since the start of the campaign]( and that's an old source undoubtedly the numbers have risen. Vice aired a good documentary about this on HBO recently about how drone strikes act as a recruitment force for terrorists. Think if you come to my country, blow up my cities, my children, my family and just pass it off as the necessary collateral damage and do nothing to make up for it. I'll want to fucking kill you to.  The government has also gone after those which exposed these documents and crimes. Hell just look at Bradley Manning he exposes the US military actively killing innocents and gets jail time for it.
But it's a perpetual cycle driven by profit. The more war the more profit. Contractors aren't in the business of solving conflicts for if there is no conflict there is no profit. Contractors make millions off military contracts. [Boeing made  $4 billion off of military contracts in 2011]( alone. Then there are all those NSA contractors which make money. Booze Allen Hamilton (one of the largest private spying contractors) has made a [profit of $219 million](

Truth is they can't just force you to give up the private keys in this case anyways. I know while in the US there is some circumstances where they can but a traffic stop where you are not convicted of a crime isn't one of those. Now sure they can steel your phone on the other hand. But those private keys are encrypted and backup at home. Plus there are way to hide files on your computer and phone so that they won't notice it is a Bitcoin wallet.

Some wallets already support NFC payment. The thing is, it doesn't really make any sense to push NFC with Bitcoin. 
Every phone has a screen with a QR code and that QR code is just an address that isn't sensitive information. So you can take any phone and any wallet and use QR codes vs having specific phones/hardware that support NFC. The only real benefit I could see to NFC with Bitcoin is if POS terminals that already have tech like PayPass and PayWave built in to their terminals could potentially add NFC Bitcoin payments quite easily.

Bitcoin isn't anonymous by default but much rather as stated. However, steps can be taken by some to "mix" or "tumble" these coins. Effectively it says you put your Bitcoin in a pool of other Bitcoins. Bob puts in his Bitcoin and get's out a combination of Joey's, Alice's, Allan's, William's, Joseph's, and Fred's coins. Effectively what Bob now sends to someone else is different coins from what he had. This makes it somewhat anonymous depending on the lengths of which Bob is willing to go to protect his privacy as it's kind of hard and takes great effort to move millions of dollars in Bitcoin without a trace (Bob will end up getting some of his Bitcoin back if he fills up the majority of the pool) but small amount's are easy to hide. 
Now this is something very problematic because now Jacob, Chris, Tommy, Alice, Allan, William, and Thomas have a chunk of their coins originating from Bob (our thief). Now these coins can pass through the hands of various other people. Essentially someone who is innocent and has no affiliation what so ever with Bob can be labelled as owning some of his Bitcoin. So now Louis might get his hands on these Bitcoin and send to Bitsamp and now Bitstamp labels him as the perp. This destroys what's called fungibility. 
Now, think of how much money floats around and exchanges hands. In both the [US and Canada about 90% of all bills in circulation have trace residue of Cocaine]( on them. Now, how many of us do coke? Not that many, but it's in your pocket right now. So while every transaction can be traced in Bitcoin, it can be very hard to determine who controls Bitcoin and if it originated from them or someone else depending on how one transacts it.

You can donate to something like Wikileaks and be like "there's no other way to do what I just did". If you have the address you are sending to open on blockchain.info then blockchain.info will update immediately live to show your transaction took place.  You could also just get anyone with and android phone to download [Bitcoin Wallet]( or Hive, or KNC's Bitcoin Wallet. These wallets are not web wallets they are thin wallets. They have no sign up process. Just one click install, open up the app and then send a few mBTC from your phone to theirs to demonstrate live.

Oh I agree. In the US when you can use any ATM for free with Bank of Internet or Everbank, and any international ATM for free with Charles Schwab then go for it. Overall I'd have to say Tangerine looks far better than CapitalOne360, for starters I can deposit cash at an ATM (all free Canadian chequing accounts let's you do this). Though CapitalOne360 does have amazing overdraft where you may literally pay pennies for something other banks will charge you hundreds of dollars. As far as I can tell that's really the only benefit for CapitalOne360, seems other banks offer overall better chequing and higher interest. Nice job spotting my comment was about Tangerine.

Exactly. Now a fictional reserve is risky and the  banks ledgers are entirely under their own control. But bitcoin it regulates it's self at a very core level. All a law can ever do is regulate business using bitcoin not bitcoin it's self. If you don't like that law simple don't use the  business, you can be your own bank with bitcoin. Even then they aren't coming down with the full force of banking regulations with Bitcoin. Only some of them. So banks may be exempt from Bit Licenses with their virtual currency the dollar but Bit Licensed firms are effectively exempt from banking regulations.

It is a Bitcoin wallet. It's not an alt. It's just a wallet with built in trustless mixing (aka tumbling). Essentially instead of just sending Bitcoin from point A to B which would be very easy to trace on the blockchain it introduces other people's coins into your transaction (you get some of Bob and Alice's coins, they get some of yours even though you are sending to Joe) as a result it's hard to correlate that A is sending  to B because B receives coins from C, D, X, and Y on A's behalf (just as a dubbed down example).

What's with the get rid of ASICs nonsense? PoW is designed with the intention of continually increasing the networks computing power to secure the blackchain. ASICs are the natural evolution of this. To say get rid of ASICs is to get rid of decentralization. At best you can maybe minimize the impact of large increases in computing power by using a memory intensive  hashing algorithm like scrypt. Or PoS coins could solve the ASIC thing, but that has it's problems too.

I think that is licensing wise the TD issue. So I'm going out on a limb here but am guessing that since Visa is number one in the online space they have said under the agreement with TD you can not allow these customers to use Interac online as it is competition and for most people this isn't an issue as credit cards are usually excepted everywhere online.  
Credit cards are prone to fraud which is why they aren't used for bitcoin. Adam actually did a bad job in saying it is a debit card deposit over Interac. It's not, its an online banking deposit. Interac online brings you to your banks website where you sign in to online banking to then approve a transfer of funds though Interac to VOS, you never once gave VOS your debit card number to do this deposit.

This is the most stupid conclusion I have ever heard. Banks employ X amount of employees and take up space. Therefore they create Y amount of electricity, so much less than bitcoin. This means more CO2 Wtf? Does Coindesk know about hydro? Every bank where I live is running on it. But ignoring alternative energy sources is just the beginning where this goes off track. 
First of all, bitcoin is an online only payment network/currency. Bitcoin doesn't have physical locations yet (sigh, Neo) and likely won't receive many. 
Second of all this article is trying to conclude that banks are expensive because of employees and physical locations. Notice how Bank of America has  almost 3 times as many employees as ING Group. However ING Group has 48 million clients world wide vs Bank of America's 50 million. ING being famous for ING Direct their online only banking  division which eliminates needs for branches and their costly staff. If ING hadn't sold just one of their former devisions (US, Canada, and UK where sold) then they would beat out BOA. Canadian division it's self holds that 2 million clients to fill the gap. 
All this article is getting at is the nonsense that banks use more electricity than bitcoin but it is all apples and oranges as they are comparing bitcoin not to currencies, but to businesses and the model they operate on. How do employees  even fit into how much CO2 a bank generates? Are they taking into account people breathing? 
**Edit/TL;DR**: Just look at the table in the summary section at the end of article. It further proves my point. They are getting the figure of how much CO2 banks emit almost entirely from a banks branches yet not only do bank not need to operate this way bitcoins most certainly do not.

In the case of Dark wallet if uses what is called Coinjoin, so I believe anyone using Coinjoin in other applications could interact with users of different applications. Though I suppose this depends on how it's implemented so I'm not entirely sure if Dark wallet users only mix with other dark wallet users. 
Dark wallet is decentralized, there is some reason why people may prefer centralized mixers for privacy reasons as it allows for off-chain transactions unlike Coinjoin. I'm not an expert on Coinjoin but if I understand it correctly Coinjoin works by having peers actively participate in mixing so each peer only knows what that peer knows (they aren't recording it and sharing it on a ledger that redistribute). For example with Bitcoin I can send you Bitcoin then turn off my computer and your computer can still be off and you will receive the Bitcoin still due the blockchain backing it and a separate network of miners. However with Dark wallet I need to have dark wallet open all the time for it to be mixing and I am only mixing coins with other people who currently have dark wallet open and running. If I shut off my computer it isn't mixing any of the coins because there is no third party (centralized or decentralized) to do the mixing for me, only me (my app) and those who I momentarily connected with. Something like this would be done over TOR to allow for true anonymity.

If it's not then it's a great way to take out a cash advance in your credit card. Lowest rates are typically on purchases only not cash advance. So if this counts as a purchase then you get interest free grace period no cash advance interest for bitcoins which you can then sell and move to bank account. Assuming fees work out better this way for the duration of your borrowing period. And with credit promos giving a few months no interest periods then it may be worth it.

They rally a bunch of users now from Canada. They are the only exchange in the country that accept deposits instantly via Interac. This is the same method of deposit used by the Canada Revenue Agency to pay your taxes online. No more waiting 3-5 days to deposit your money you can do it drunk at 3 in the morning and have bitcoins immediately this is a game changer. Esspecialy since fees are low for this type of payment and VOS's regular price for it is $1.50. This makes me excited to sign up. This also only requires level 2 verification to use this is unlike the more strict policy of both CaVirtex and VOS for using other payment methods.

@_date: 2014-06-18 05:26:50
It can't happen with bitcoin, not the money multiplier at least. The reason it happens with fiat is because you can duplicate fiat. If I deposit $100 into the bank and the reserve ratio is 10:1 they go and lend out $90. That $90 (which is bank credit) goes to an other bank. That other bank treats at as a normal deposits and can then hold it and lend out $81. I still have my $100 though. This comes as fiat has its origin in gold. You would deposit 1oz of gold and the bank gives you a receipt. Then they went and gave me one for the same gold. But people would trade receipts instead of the gold as it is hard to lug around gold. The system could stay afloat and it increases the supply of money. 
With a Bitcoin fractional reserve the way it would work is I deposit 100 mBTC now the bank say lends out 90 mBTC. Now if I wan't my 100 mBTC I can't get it. They don't have it. I won't accept a receipt for my Bitcoin. I want my Bitcoin. So this creates a system where instead of increasing the supply of money with a fractional reserve it instead just displaces it.
at least that's how I understand it...

I know this applies to you in part but it's not like credit cards are always the only way to buy online.
1) You can do an ACH transfer to PayPal and buy things with PayPal. The big con with this is the PayPal let's merchants have subscription and choose to only allow for purchases though accounts funded with credit cards to support this automatic charge. This means often you can not pay for the thing you want. Also Person must be at least 18 to use PayPal. 
2) Pre-Paid cards. This is problematic because each time you buy one they charge you a fee. This means you continually pay more for everything you buy than you other wise would be. Many banks though offer Visa/Mastercard prepaid debit cards that can be loaded up when ever you desire with funds from your bank account. These are usually marketed for travel purposes though. This can save you lots of money in fees. Additionally in Canada TD bank's normal debit card is also a Visa debit card so the same card you use for debit transactions can now be used anywhere online. (there is reason why Bitcoiners hate this though) 
3) This one doesn't apply to you in the States but I'm going to point it out anyways to show there are alternatives to credit cards. In Canada there is Interac Online. This allows for people to use their online banking to buy stuff online. The benefit of this is it is instant payment, it is cheap for the merchant with no large cut taken by credit card company each time. No sensitive info is given and it is less prone to charge backs. For these reasons it has become popular for bitcoin sites now (Vault of satoshi takes it for instant deposit, you could deposit $2500 for only a fee of $1.50) Plus unlike other options people under 18 can use it. In general few merchants accept this though. 
Bitcoin stands out though in that it is the only low to no cost global debit network. So it is great for a merchants perspective for this plus no charge backs and low fees.

Before Apple banned bitcoin  apps Coinbase had an app then it was banned , as did blockchain (which wasn't nearly as good as their Android app) Then Apple lifted ban. Now there is a third party Coinbase app in the App store. It is not under Coinbase's name but an other dev. Coinbase did endorse it. You can download it but you must use the API key to use the app. You can't buy bitcoins with the app but it should work fine as a wallet. [here's the app store link](  The parent comment says he has two because he still has original app before it was banned and the new app.

Quebecer here. There is no law that says Dell must provide service bilingually. Just like how there is no law that says Target needs to speak English in Montreal. However there is a law that says if you service Quebec you must provide service in French or get sued by the OLF. Bilingual is optional. So if service is only provided in English this means they would need to exclude the province of Quebec. This is why you often see a little * from companies saying not available in Quebec.

Yeah I watched the video after writing that. It sounds extremely prone to credit card fraud. If someone gets stolen card numbers with CCVs they want Bitcoin as the fraudsters can tumble those coins and make his activity untraceable (he wouldn't buy on Amazon and send to him self). That said purse.io sounds like a high percentage of people buying are doing so to cash out (who else would pay 15% when circle could be 2-3% for credit cards). So it kind of sketches me out using purse.io to buy stuff because if I buy something off Amazon using purse and the person that actually paid for it is making a fraudulent charge it is attached to my address. I wouldn't want the cops showing up because I was just trying to buy with Bitcoin on purse.io.

You know there is a middle ground between cold storage and Web wallets (and then there are now 3 different types of Web wallets each with different levels of security) 
You can store bitcoins with a client on your computer, preferably a deterministic wallet. Think of it this way. A website exposes your bitcoins to anyone with the info to permit log in, eg. Your password. This is because you can log in anywhere with Internet access. Cold storage keeps all private keys offline at all times never once exposing the storage medium to the Internet. But a client on your computer such as electrum requires a password but I didn't put it out in the cloud where anyone with that password can get it. Instead it would require access to your computer and the medium required for authentication. So it's a step up and you still control the keys, keys where never exposed to the whole world or put under control of someone else..

Yes especially if you are using a scummy bank with high fee business account,  cash is still less than a credit card. 
Of course there are variables across different countries. [The Bank of Canada did a study on the costs of accepting payment as a merchant.](    The BOC determined that the typical basket of goods sold is valued at $36.50. They  then  determined that the costs of accepting cash for a basket of goods at that price is $0.25, for debit $0.19, and for credit $0.82. Effectively in Canada at least it is cheaper to accept debit than cash but credit is still most expensive. 
Note that this doesn't refer to a Visa/Mastercard debit network which likely has higher fees but rather  Canada's domestic not for profit Interac debit network. The fee Interac themselves takes is less $0.006362 per transaction the other fees associated are for banks and payment processors.

If you are scared go for a more reliable exchange where they are a registered business. An exchange that deals in Fiat if it disappeared would face legal consequences. Some of these exchanges like Vault of Satoshi and Kraken do trade in alts in addition to fiat. Cryptsy always has more alts but the main ones other exchanges have also.

Coinbase pays transaction fees for you  and any merchants already accepting bitcoin via Coinbase now allows you to buy quickly with a simple log in (why use PayPal  you  have a credit card). Then it allows for easy access to your funds on multiple devices (eg. Phone, laptop, tablet). They also have a nice app. It makes it easy to use and manage money. You don't need to worry about backups if you loose your phone either. I wouldn't trust it for any large amounts of bitcoins. Control the private keys is like my bank.

Virtex never had Interac Online once. VOS is the first in the country to have it and I believe first in the world to accept instant deposits. Interac Online and Interac email money transfers are two different things with the later being prone to fraud. People likely haven't done it historically because it is only available to customers of 4 different banks so you want to have deposit methods that anyone can use first.


Nope, because you need to have the bank account under the same name as the account at the exchange and try making a bank account with forged documents and a SIN. So you would need 20 VOS accounts with fake documents of the owners of 20 hacked bank accounts of different people. So that's quite the crime spree you are going on. Let's not forgot it would be just as easy to steel money doing an EFT this way.

As for forking the block chain is not about someone posting lots of double spending. It's about getting the majority of the mining power to agree to the fork. 
For fees this is up on the air. We do not know but if bitcoin goes huge we are looking at so much transactions per day that perhaps it will work out to be enough to fund the network and this crowding from people paying low fees should cause high value transactions to include a higher fee to process faster. 
For deflation Forbes wrote an article about how deflation isn't a bad thing and can be beneficial. I'll update with link if I can find it. But overall all people say why spend your bitcoins today if they are worth more tomorrow. But why accept dollars if they are worth less tomorrow? Not to mention with fiat money the system that backs it is so unstable it could also collapse in a heart beat. I think a lot of this argument against deflation is largely from a lot if economists that somehow think it's good as they were brought into such a broken system that has conditioned them to see not problems with it

Scotiabank bought them from ING Group. Ownership changed. This is why they changed names and rebranded because they don't have the naming rights to ING any more. They actually have been owned by Scotiabank for over a year now. They are remaining a separate company and will operate as they are now. The only thing that has changed now is that they no longer deal with mortgage brokers which is where they got most of their mortgage business. The CEO of ING Direct Canada remains the CEO of Tangerine. This is why they say nothing in changing. In fact the CEO said the only reason why he stayed on board was because he was confident Scotia wasn't going to start pulling the strings. He did admit in a Toronto Star article how there is always this thought in the back of his head that stock holders will say I'm sick of this guy, he's not a banker because of his untraditional banking model. But overall not much is changing they remain the same. 
They are however changing bank machine networks form The Exchange Network to Scotiabank. While I'm not thrilled of this because I prefer the exchange network here it is just more accessible to me in Quebec. For travel with Scotia switch it is great because they are on the Global ATM alliance so you can use partner bank machines free of charge with them. The American partner is Bank of America so that's great for travel not being charged fees there. Which is great for a $0 account Tangerine also has a 3 cent bid/ask spread on USD as opposed to the 6 cent spread of the big banks which is real nice.

So I'm assuming you are saying hypothetically someone could have two accounts on an exchange. Let's say it's Bitstamp they use. Someone could have two accounts and in one account deposit 10k BTC and then deposit money into an other account at Bitstamp. Now lets say at the time the Bitcoin price is $350. They then place bid in dollar funded account at lets say $200 and sell order in Bitcoin account for $200. 
Now the problem with this is. They aren't the only buyers of the Bitcoin they are selling. Between $200 and $350 there are a lot of other buyers and their orders will be filled as they have a higher price. So while some of the Bitcoin might go back to the trader an other share of it will go to other buyers. Subsequently this guy who thought he was being smart looses a lot of money because he sold something and only got a portion of it back to him self.

Tangerine (formally ING Direct Canada) also does this. I think the reason is because they are a direct bank and when they first started out (at least in Canada) they stared as telephone banking only. Only a year later they  launched online banking and even then online wouldn't have been wide spread at that time. The whole enter a pin thing works out great for a phone. You call them up and log into your account by typing in your pin. That's why they just of kept the pin. 
Banks don't give a shit about security.

For starters. The public doesn't know about something that just launched (Coinbase in EU, Circle).
Consumers also cater to advertising. They need to know about a product, it's use, they need to want it. For it to be a familiar brand that is commonly seen. Familiarity  keeps Bitcoin out of the fringe side of things. We're heading in this direct. Pheeva wallet made an ad (don't think it aired), Coinbase teamed up with Budwiser and the most notable thing is probably going to be Bitcoin St. Petersburg Bowl. Still not enough is going towards branding and advertising to attract the average Joe to every nerd and/or libertarian wet dream. 
We need to focus on remittance market which brings us to issue number two. Half the world can buy Bitcoin, the half of the world that doesn't need Bitcoin. Bitcon can bring developing nations on the grid. That's what we need. To many people think the dollar is wonderful Visa and MC are great. We need to shatter that image and highlight what Bitcoin can do, what fiat can not.
You can't just say "hey Bitcoin's great" we need to appeal to the every day person. That doesn't mean preaching the whole "Fuck the Fed" attitude, remove political motivation from Bitcoin. Appeal to the every day normal guy. "How does Bitcoin fit into my life?", "How does Bitcoin solve my problems", "Why do I enjoy Bitcoin", "Why should I use Bitcoin over other services". Also, maybe we shouldn't be focuses on pushing Bitcoin, but financial services as a whole which are backed by Bitcoin. Don't show the consumer some fringe thing, show them something they've been waiting for all this time.
We also need to target transnational B2B payments.

Bitstamp is also a place that sort of sets the price as it's a huge exchange. It's prices change realtime and we'll differ a few dollars from other exchanges. Circle is just a reseller. $3 isn't something to pick about in that case.

Why not just use something like [Bank of Internet Rewards Checking]( They reimburse all ATM fees, the checking account pays up to 1.25% interest, it is a free account with no minimum balances that has 24/7 customer support and let's you deposit a check by taking a picture of it on your phone. When you use direct banks you get better rates, no fees and large ATM networks. Other similar banks are CapitalOne360 and Ally as well as others though they have their own ATM networks. The only problem with [direct banks]( in the US is none of them have ATM networks that accept cash deposits. All the Canadian Direct banks with free chequing offer cash deposits at ATMs.

Yeah I think CaVirtex says the same now too, though didn't care when I signed up. It always makes me laugh though how they say a native status card is good but not health care. I've seen those cards a legit native status card looks like something you printed at home. 
When I signed for for ING Direct though and needed to prove who I was to them they specifically said you can not use health care card *unless* it is a Quebec one. Which makes me wonder if that means there is for some reason a loophole in whatever the KYC law is.

People bash the foundation because half of this sub is made up of anti government libertarian anarchists and the foundation is there to work with government. 
These people need to get one thing straight though. Government will try to get involved in regulating bitcoin I don't think you can really say that the bitcoin foundation wants regulation but that they know it it's coming and want to work with government to make it manageable regulations that aren't the worst out there. No bad comes from that. 
To people who want freedom with bitcoin. You got it. No one can regulate the blockchain. It's like trying to pass a law to get rid of gravity. That's why this tech exists you do have freedom no matter what government doesn't do long as they don't make bitcoin illegal which won't happen if we work with government to stop them from taking actions like that. 
You can have the best of both worlds. A clear understanding of where bitcoin fits in the law, increased investment from VCs in the process and your freedom with things like Dark Wallet. Why do people not get this? Now there has been some coin validation nuts out there but I don't think they are much of a threat. Imagine validation on dollars when 90% of cash has trace residue of cocaine on it? That won't happen, neither will it with bitcoin because any one doing it will loose out on all of their money. 
@_date: 2014-06-04 20:48:19
So that means putting 2/3rds your bitcoins inside centralized services. Only keep spending amounts inside of those. You could also use something like blockchain or bitgo which would be a step up from those as they don't actuallycontrol your keys. For savings amounts at the very least use electrum or multibit. Unless you are scared of viruses because you are the type of person who can't get rid of rid of those on your own and who will easily install the wrong "flash player update" then a service like Coinbase might be safer. 
BUT ALWAYS USE TWO FACTOR AUTHENTICATION at the very least with SMS. I recommend using Authy though, I think Coinbase is even teamed up with them or something. 
@_date: 2014-03-10 17:30:57
He said we eventually store offline. If I understand right. Being a shared wallet it's almost like coinbase tumbles the coins upon deposit. So it goes from deposit address to I'm guessing a hot wallet which can move around funds as they feel needed and mix it with other deposits. This can't be achieved with cold storage as you can't automate the transaction because the private keys are tucked away. You would then remove the excess of coins in the hot wallet to cold storage.

Open source currency. 
The ability to control your own money. 
Brain wallets (although a security risk is fkn cool to store money in your mind) 
That it's decentralized. 
No transaction fees, we'll very small and flat rate (eg send a million dollars for 10¢)
And the most important. Juxtapose it to fiat currency. Specifically talk about fractional reserve banking and correspondence banking (how wire transfer work)  one you look at that you start to notice how much a mess fiat is and how much you are enslaved to the banks. Bitcoins let you be independent of that. With bitcoin you are your own bank. 
Then listen to a bunch of  Andreas Antonopoulos. he Brings up great points like how bitcoin is a trustless system. Check out when he was on [Joe Rogan Experience](  (highly recommend podcast) or when he was on [freedom radio](

Well ripple is centralized. I suppose it would depend how bitcoin develops though. Who exchanges ripples for dollars? Ripple that's who. Why trades bitcoins for fiat? Who ever wants to. This means more places to do the trading. From my understanding ripple would be to establish its self in a given country. But with bitcoin it can establish it's self

Don't down vote me without reading this though. I'm not being pro bank here. 
I can deposit a cheque by camera phone and get the money instantly. I did it the other night at mid night and got $300 deposited instantly, no hold and available in my account and was only told to hold onto the cheque for up to 5 days should there be a problem. I got an email from my bank 4 days later telling me to destroy the cheque. Not 2 weeks. I can also email money to anyone with any bank in the country online 24/7 and it only takes 30 min total for them to receive it  and costs $1. Now I realize  the Canadian banking system is a little different just pointing things out though. 
What I'm getting  at is that the Internet changed the banking system already. Just look at [direct banks](    . Now thanks to the Internet a tiny little bank located at the other end of the country can service me though the Internet and give me free service and the highest interest rate in the country without me ever needing  to leave home to sign up. There are 5 banks and 1 giant credit Union where I live. But thanks to the Internet it's more like 15 banks that service my area. Chase for example offers highest interest rate of 0.1% and only on deposits above $25k yet anyone in the US can get a savings account with 0.95% on all deposits from My Optimizer plus and do so from anywhere in the country. Just look at bankrate.com you'd be shocked all the competition there is in financial service thanks to the Internet and the advent of direct banking. 
My point is the biggest threat to banks isn't bitcoin alone. It's competition. The Internet is the biggest enabler of competition as it breaks down so many barriers. Don't get me wrong bitcoin is great and the furthering evolution to the financial services industry. Bitcoin once again will change  the world and break down even more barriers. It will decentralize much if the world. But really it's not the first innovation in a long time for the financial service industry, the Internet is.

Considering the difference I didn't see it worth while. They likely have a small order book too. Also Once you factoring in the fees of both exchanges and then waiting for the time for it to transfer though banks it didn't seem worth it. To me unless maybe you have a lot of money.

Well on one hand yes. On the other hand  no. As other user pointed out the funding is for freedom in countries where people are suppressed, hey, what do you know? That also includes us and is why Wikileaks needs a TOR hidden service. 
On the other hand  government has a lot of shit they want to hide from us. No technology can exist (on the Internet at any rate,  I am talking strictly about software) which permits government to do something and not have at the very least a similar technology that common man can't use. The motivation for the navy opening up the TOR network to the public is that you can't hide only amongst yourself. If TOR was only used by the US government then it's very easy to tell all TOR traffic is the US government. But if there is a mix of the public and the government then all of  a sudden. Who's who? 
It's still quite ironic though that on one hand the government spends lots of money to make TOR secure while on the other hand also gives lots of money to the NSA to try and break TOR and make it less secure.

The memeric is your private key. Though it seems there is a way to establish a link between your memeric and your account at Green Address It. This means you need both Green Address It's approval as well as your own to spend the bitcoins. This means no one has full control over the bitcoins and a mutual agreement is needed between two parties to get the keys. So if you losse your memeric and your phone doesn't have it saved in their app you loose your bitcoins. This would normally mean that if green address it disappeared you would lose your funds, to solve this problem (instead of going 2-3)  they have it so you can use nTimeLock to send all the bitcoins after X amount of blocks to only your memeric.

Well if we're talking strictly about seeds here it doesn't mean it's illegal. There are various clearnet sites that sell Marijuana seeds (just look up Nirvana Seeds) in various jurisdictions seeds themselves are perfectly legal even though the grown plant many not be. So the seller themselves may have not broken any law. In Coinbase's jurisdiction (the US) however marijuana seeds are illegal. It sounds not like Bitcoin was transferred out if Coinbase and then from receiving wallet to a vendor but instead a transaction directly between Coinbase and the seller. As such Coinbase was used to facilitate an illegal transaction in their view. OP makes no mention of his jurisdiction but as a wallet Coinbase offers service in most countries. It may very well even be legal to buy seeds for OP.

I don't think this would effect all ATMs. I did use an ATM once and looked up it's address on the blockchain. Seems the ATM was keeping reserves of Bitcoin on it locally and would automatically fill up those reserves when required. The issue this makes is that they must sell the Bitcoin at same price or greater or suffer a loss. 
If an ATM sources coins directly from an exchange and all trades are made live on the market then this shouldn't be much of an issue.

You miss the point. See with fiat currency there is no way for me to transact my dollars digitally independent of a third party. Simply put I wouldn't be trusted to manipulate the ledgers that make up dollars. 
With Bitcoin it encompasses a payment network that is part of the currency. I can not use Bitcoin without using the blockchain. Effectively there is now no need for a third party when I can do their job myself for free. Why would anyone pay fees to Visa when their role becomes obsolete. Bitcoin is a world wide network that has the potential to be even bigger than Visa. So when Visa isn't necessary to transact people won't use them to transact Bitcoin. If Visa has any future in Bitcoin it is moving fiat currency and Visa using Bitcoin in their backbone without the knowledge of the user in order to facilitate transactions faster and cheaper.

Not really. Ever since the original Silkroad site was taken down several sites have popped up. Silkroad 2 isn't even the most popular market before today. [With at least 2 markets superseding SR2]( They take down SR2, the admins and mods might go to jail if they are caught. SR disabled escrow too so there won't be a shit ton of Bitcoin for the government to seize. For every drug dealer on SR2 they will just move their business to those other 2 or 3 sites they are already selling on simultaneously. 
The police trying to take down market places like these is like play wack a mole. After SR the dark net got publicity and people saw a market opportunity. There is at least  20 - 30 different dark net markets and they are only becoming more and more resistant to attempts to take them down (think multisig and decentralized blockchain based markets). All silkroad users will still be buying drugs tomorrow.

It's the highest interest rate on a savings account in all of Canada and the only savings account in the whole country that outpaces the CPI. TFSA (Tax Free Savings Account) from People's Trust. This isn't a regular saving account there are contribution limits determined by government (you are granted $5500 of space each year from the year you turn 18) and many people will favour their tax free  contribution space for investments over savings. Highest rate on a regular savings account here is 2% which does not beat out the CPI especially after tax which isn't applicable to a TFSA. [Inflation data Canada] (

@_date: 2014-04-21 23:33:32




It is largely true for most people that interest on savings account doesn't make up for inflation. However in many countries you can find banks that offer interest rates above the rate of inflation. I have quickly looked though savings accounts in the US and it does seem that they all pay such low interest rates that you are loosing out no matter what. 
In Canada though. It's only the big banks that screw you on this. In Canada the **rate of inflation has between 1 - 2.4%** for past few years. Roughly the same as the US. All the **big 6 banks offer interest rates of roughly 1%**  and most small banks will too. However there are a couple that don't. 
In Canada the highest **interest rates on a savings account in is currently 3%**the bank with the **second runner up is 2.25%** Now that's on Tax free Savings Account (TFSA) which is where you find the highest interest rates. They do have some limitations though such as how many dollars you can put in per year. This isn't a problem for much of the middle class though. 
Non TFSAs have the highest interest rates of 1.90% but you have to pay tax on that so you might just break even with the rate of inflation or loose a bit.
These high interest account's are largely from direct banks. So most of the population in Canada gets screwed over because they don't know how to Google search and just walk to the bank down the street. 
Sure bitcoin was 5500% gain in 2013. But my point is while most people gets screwed over from inflation. You can find ways to avoid it and in many countries this is a reality. 
You can also get higher rates from term deposits (CDs, GICs, ect...) so if you are looking to save and not have immediate access to your money. If you are smart about it then inflation its a non issue. Though it does seem to make a large difference based on what country you live in.
Edit: 
**TL;DR**: If you shop around instead of just walking to the bank down the street or thinking of the only names which come to mind you might just get high enough interest that you don't loose out to inflation.
edit 2: Past 10 years in Canada rate of inflation has actually ranged from 0.31% - 2.77%.

From my understanding 1 Bitcoin confirmation (10 min) is definitely stronger than 1 Litecoin confirmation (2.5 min). But to have say 2 Bitcoin confirmations for Bitcoin means 20 min where as Litecoin over that period of time would be 8 Litecoin confirmations. Eventually it passes a threshold where smaller block time   is  more secure.

You know the TOR was created not just so you can hide from the government what you do but also so that the government can hide from you what they are doing. No shit they are using TOR, they invented it. 
A lot if people also don't recognize that the NSA has two jobs. Find vulnerabilities in enemy communications and strengthen the government's own communications. TOR is open source we know everything that backs it. TOR never guaranteed 100% anonymity anyways. It just provides far greater anonymity than other solutions. Also due to the nature is TOR of you aren't a big target you may as well be invisible. If your a big target the probability of an exploit increases far greater. Also on terms of unmasking an IP an attacker needs to control at the very least the entry and exit node. If the only control one of the 3 nodes that comprise a circuit (or 2 in the event that it is middle and entry, or middle and exit) then they didn't accomplish their goal of deanominizing you instead they still aided I providing you with anonymity.

Aww PC Financial. I'm using Tangerine I took a quick look at PC and they don't match up to me. They also look crappy. Tangerine has great website and full featured mobile banking app that really does a lot and seems like a professional company to me. Unlike PC (at least at a glance). All cheques though are free with PC though? I assumed it was only first cheque book like Tangerine. Tangerine though is far cheaper when you need to buy a cheque book than the big banks it only costs $12 for 50. Even if CIBC was a part of Interac online PC still wouldn't get it since it's though online banking with the bank, not the bank machines network.

Even so [LD50 of MDMA]( isn't that low. The article gives little to no details and even uses words like believed to have taken. 
On top of that the most common doses of MDMA deaths are not over doses. Dehydration often accelerated by alcohol consumption is a leading cause. Other leading causes are over consumption of water. These kids start hearing go drink lots of water to stay safe and prevent [hyperthermia](wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperthermia)   and drink to much. They therefore suffer problems from lack of electrolytes, something accelerated by sweating while dancing and preventable from consumption of sports drinks like Gatorade. 
Other causes are adulterates which I don't think these pills have. 
A legitimate MDMA overdose is also what's called [serotonin syndrome](  Having to much serotonin is deadly and  can lead to seizures.

In the US it already has this requirement. Fincen said it falls under existing law. Me send you money wouldn't require licensing just like how I don't need to be licensed to give you dollars. Money transmitter is Coinbase and Circle. If any difference in this respect calling bitcoin a currency would probably just mean companies like that need to report bitcoin transfers over 10k just like banks do. You can't stop anyone though from transferring 10k better  themselves in cash, same with bitcoin only globally.

No doubt nsa wants to break encryption, that's their job. This does not mean that everything has a backdoor in it. I think you miss understand open source security. If it is closed source there may very well be a back door. But when it is open source if there is a backdoor it is there for you and I to exploit just as much as for the NSA. Which means we are here to discover it as well. The nsa becomes irrelevant in this context.

Yep and then not only does that money come out of thin air and have interest on it but most of the Feds profits get paid to the US government. So it's paying it's self for doing it. And then a lot of government bonds are also bought by government agencies with tax payers money. Things like social security get included in that bunch too. Since that's not held in reserve it's like the creation of more money. So yep it's quite the cluster fuck.

To change the world. Bitcoin has never really been so much about Bitcoin. It's about Dollars, Euros, yen and so forth. It's about Bitcoin not being any of those. 
The world payment system and currency is overwhelmingly flawed and truth is, the average Joe doesn't know that, and he doesn't care. Because to the average Joe, the dollar works just great. However fiat currency at its very base is corrupt. 
The monetary system as you know it, as exists today, it was never something where a bunch of people sat down  at a table and planned out what is the best monetary system we can have to optimize the potential and ingenuity of man kind. Instead our banking system involved out of greed. By banks who's products are currency looking to make a profit every step of the way. It is a system built by those who benefit from it and not to optimize the plant's will being. This system has there been morphed into what it is today by those who don't care about you, but about profit. 
Bitcoin is a response to this system and a criticism. It is where someone (Satoshi Nakamoto) went ahead and thought up in response to the 2008 financial crisis. A redesign of the system. This leads to a system with a fixed supply of currency, no uncontrolled inflation, an unbiased currency controlled by no one, and a global currency that is fast, efficient, borderless, accessible to all with no middle men trying to take a cut. 
Bitcoin is a revolution and monetary reform. It is a system made for you. You just don't know it. It takes an understanding of what currency is  and it's flaws, once juxtaposed to Bitcoin then you'll understand why it is up 600% ~~YTD.~~ over a years time span. 
Edit: is up that much over the course of a year not YTD.

I'm under the impression that Circle deals in USD only. So that means your CAD credit card is going to charge you 2.5% foreign currency transaction fee (unless you have a card like Amazon.ca credit card with no foreign transaction fee) on top of the 2 or so % that Circle will charge you for using a credit card instead of ACH isn't worth it when you can get a bank account that supports Interac Online and lets you buy instantly from QuadregaCX or Vault of Satoshi for only a 0.5% or less fee. Circle doesn't benefit you to buy, it's not free for us.

You forgot something. And that's that 90 something  percent of the Feds profits go to the US government. Despite the Fed operating as a private company largely not controlled by the government it is still the US Treasury that takes most of the profits of the Fed. The government literally pays interest on its debt to its self, even though most government bonds aren't bought by the Fed.

If this is the case you are on a lower end lower fee plan where if you surpass the monthly amount of transactions allowed you are charged to fulfil a transaction (like a debit card). You are on [ account]( or [this account]( if you are being charged a fee. as they are only 10 - 25 transaction free per month.
I pay $0 in fees and my bank has paid me more money in cash up front than I have ever paid to them. I don't bank with big banks because big banks rip me off, they charge high fees and pay low interest. [All of these accounts are free, no minimum balances, unlimited transaction chequing accounts]( I actually only use big bank on the side to buy Bitcoin with Interac Online.
My self I use Tangerine as a bank. This was formally ING Direct but Scotiabank bought them. They use Scotiabank ATMs. Tangerine is Canada's first [Direct bank]( This means a bank that is online/phone/mail only it doesn't have branches and in doing so has a significantly lower operating costs some of which is then passed on to the customer in the forum of no/lower fees and better interest. My account is $0 per month, it pays 0.25% interest (yes, I'm talking about my chequing account, my chequeing account pays interest), it has no minimum balance. It is free unlimited transactions. I do not pay to use an ATM as long as it is Scotiabank (or any international member of the Global ATM Alliance including Bank of America and Barclays). Also I can call the bank 24/7 because they operate 24/7. As part of Tangerine recently switching their ATM network to Scotia only from The Exchange Network Tangerine is giving clients $1 each time they use a Scotiabank ATM, now this is only up to a maximum of $5, but its a nice thought. That and they do frequent sign up bonuses. I got $125 from switching to them and opening my account. I then got an other $50 for referring my friend, they also gave him $50 because thats how they role. They like to get clients through word of mouth and about every second post on is people talking about and recommending Tangerine. I have paid maybe $5 to Tangerine in total for Interac Email Transfer fees, I have made $175 that they gave me to say thank you for being a customer.
I'm a Bitcoiner, I store money online and on my cell phone. Naturally I also go ahead and use online banks because I enjoy having actual competition and being able to go and just get the [highest interest rate on a savings account in]( the country by not limiting my self to the guys down the street. Yes, Tangerine is CIDC insured if you are wondering.
If there is one thing I have learned in my life and through the marketing classes I have taken. Is that there is far more competition available to people than they know, but instead people fallow the heard, they want what advertisements tell them to want, and they surccumb to [brand loyalty]( Most people where I live think there are 4 banks in town and 7 within the greater area. But theres about 20+ that service this area. Most people think there are 2 internet service providers where I live. But there are actually 30 according to [CanadianISPs.](
**TL;DR (sorta): Sorry for getting carried away with a rant, maybe I don't really like big banks. I don't pay fees because I don't want to and everyone in Canada doesn't need to because in every city in this country you can get an account that has no fees, and every city in this country you can get the highest rate on a savings account or GIC in the country and you can get the [best mortgage rate also.](

Will it fall a bit. Don't know. Will it go up more maybe. But as far as I'm concerned having seen bitcoin go up to $1200 before $580 seems like a reasonable price. I think we have hit the bottom and won't see it go back to below $430 ever. So if you want bitcoin as a long term investment or even for the span of a few months then now is a great time to buy. If your a trader and want real short term gains then it is to early to say that you won't see the price drop that $60 dollars or so.

For starters this is a post Bitcoin Foundation of Canada where only federal licensing is required and cheap, only provincial level licensing would by in Quebec with the AMF but no "state"  level regulations elsewhere. This is one of the reasons American entrepreneurs left the US to come to Canada to launch [Harbor.ly](    (whose Canadian private beta will launch in a weeks time.) 
Secondly 51 different states might mean 51 different regulations but some are bound to be more lax, California passed law legalizing Bitcoin  and Silicon  Valley is having a nerdgasum over Bitcoin. It's fair to think some regulators (especially those in a tech savvy state) will realize that Bitcoin at the end of the day is just an application on a computer and not treat it like regulating a bank. 
We also aren't talking about unregulated business, in the US and in Canada (even under new bitcoin regulations) the companies are being regulated under current laws. They just aren't being regulated  under Bitcoin specific laws/licensing like New York.

It doesn't take a massive amount of resources to double spend. It takes a massive amount of resources to have that double spend confirmed. 
There seems to be this misconception of what double spending is. Yes to get the block confirmed and have it sent where you want you need computing power. But to send the same amount of bitcoin to one address then to an other with a higher fee one will get confirmed before the other. If a merchants isn't confirmed then he loses out on all of those bitcoins he thought he had.
There is a reason why sites wait for confirmation. Because a balance could be double spent and later show up as unconfirmed. 
The standard of waiting for 6 confirmations comes from the notion that you need 10% if the networks power to have those coins confirmed.

Yeah VOS solved the long time to deposit problem with Interac instant deposits but you would need to see all the exchanges adopt this and hopefully very fast or instant withdrawal methods. This would make arbitrage too easy to pull off so the gap would shrink rapidly. 
Maybe you could do instant withdrawal over credit card VOS is currently doing this and then transfer the credit card funds to chequing account but with CCs taking a 2% or so fee I don't think this would work out for you unless its free for withdrawal for some reason. I guess you could also do the debit card withdrawal from CaVirtex which will be fast but that then means taking a bunch of cash out at an ATM to deposit into your bank account and doing this frequently and not looking like a terrorist/drug dealer and not having the bank put the funds on hold. So really as things stand the situation is still as described in my original reply.

Many people have been getting aggravated about the $50 fee that is charged for non active accounts. I understand that this has to do with discouraging use as a wallet but more needs to be done than charging people money. People need to be made more clearly aware of this fee. They need to have a heads up and warning so it is not going to happen to them unsuspectingly and $50 might be a little excessive considering that we are talking about small amounts of bitcoins people leave in their account. 
Regardless nice to see CaVirtex hit us up on Reddit and understand the community. Bitcoin is truly the one and only thing where we get so see something like this across the board where companies communicate directly with their user base.

That's the reason behind them. That's the whole point. I'll take a bank that has no branches over one that has plenty any day. When a bank has no branches it's operating expenses are reduced significantly while allowing for increased coverage to all areas of  the country. In addition to this it allows for increased competition in the region which you live in. This is known as a direct bank and is the model which ING became famous for. This is why CapitalOne360 offers higher interest and no fees. I do all my banking online. I don't care about branches and given the option not to pay for them though fees I'll take that any day. 
Capital one does actually have a hand full of branches also and there are actually better direct banks than them but they still got some things going for them. 
To put into perspective the discrepancy between  them and a big bank. CapitalOne360 (and all direct banks in the US for that matter)  pay higher interest on their checking account than the big banks in the US. Chase's highest interest rate is 0.1%(and that's in deposits over $25k) Bank of America highest rate is 0.03%. Those banks all charge fees. Meanwhile even CapitalOne360 checking account pays 0.19% intetest on deposits as low as $1. Then anywhere in America you can [get up to 0.95% interest on savings accounts on deposits of all size. .](   and if you qualify for the promo Everbank will give you 1.4%for the first year. 
Disclaimer: I'm not from the US and know the Canadian direct (branches)  banking market most but have looked into the US one a lot and come to discover how much the big bank market sucks a fat one in the US but branchless banks are better than others in all countries.

Straight from the belly of the beast




The Government will introduce legislative amendments to strengthen Canada’s anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing regime.












Make online casinos subject to the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act.
Enhance the ability of the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC) to disclose to federal partners threats to the security of Canada, consistent with the Government’s response to the Commission of Inquiry into the Investigation of the Bombing of Air India Flight 182.
To implement these amendments, the Government proposes to provide FINTRAC up to $10.5 million over five years and up to $2.2 million per year ongoing. The Government also proposes to provide up to $12 million on a cash basis over five years to improve FINTRAC’s analytics system. This investment will increase efficiency, improve data quality and better meet the needs of Canadian law enforcement and other regime partners.
That's form the governments website outlining the budget. It would seem that press is basing what they are saying solely on that. which is very vauge.

Foreigners can bring in Bitcoin to Venezuela and sell for the dollar black dollar rate of bolivar. Then if they can trade for official or close to price outside of the country they have large arbitrage opportunities. Bitcoin will effectively need to get into Venezuela and similar countries the way Dollars and Euros get into Venezuela. Then if it grows you can get a domestic Bitcoin economy.

No you can't. Mind you in Canada there is Email money transfer which is quick but I think the max is $3000. In the USA and even in Canada direct deposit takes a few days. In much of Europe SEPA transfers are also very fast. But they aren't any faster than that 30 min to confirm a bitcoin transaction.
What happens is when you send money by bank you get the illusion that it was transferred instantly but really it wasn't. It sure wasn't received instantly. No doubt handing cash to someone in person is faster but actually sending money though the bank isn't faster than bitcoin by any means. Just because you did something to initiate a transaction doesn't mean it has already taken place.

In theory scrypt means that even with ASICs due to a heavier reliance on memory than SHA-256 you will not see increase of power for future generations of ASICs that you do with bitcoin meaning a more gradual rise in difficulty for litecoin as opposed to bitcoin  this means more miners as less people are pushed out from obsolete hardware and therefore a more decentralized network. 
Then yeah we all know confirmation time. This is beneficial especially for websites and exchanges which need to shuffle around large amounts of coins and wait for at least 1 confirmation to do so. While other coins may have faster confirmation time eventually the faster it is the less secure. Litecoin also has the hashing power to support it that other coins do not. 
Litecoin also has more development than other alts

The blockchain? Seriously though while the legislation purposes other hurdles all the transactions are catalogued. No bitcoin company should need to do anymore than the most basic of data retention. The rest is done be the network. 
You don't need a hosted wallet to transact. You can do it independent and good luck trying to get something like BitFog to comply with a bit license, lol. 
Your bank account is already super on the record bitcoin can remain less so. Where this Bit Licenses bug me is with start ups. You can go download some code off Github and register the domain now the world is your customer, just like that. What worries me is this being made illegal, a small no name person breaking the law for doing an act so simple which brings innovation and competition. There is a reason Satoshi is anonymous, so the law doesn't come after him for not going dotting all the I's and crossing all the T's and for how he created a international money transmitter that isn't capable of doing KYC and AML, it's something that would be treated as criminal. We are just lucky it was done at a time before anyone could predict it. 
Edit: I also worry about any business looking to transact in bitcoin independent of a third party to save costs (taking advantage of Bitcoin being free vs paying Coinbase, BitPay) these laws could easily make someone doing so require a Bit Licenses.

Google Authenticator is basically just a name. Google doesn't have anything to do with your 2FA on other sites. 
The way 2FA works is all the codes are generated client side. They are based on the date and time. 
The website generates a code and puts that code in a qr code. You import that code into your phone, now what it does is look at the time on your phone and runs it against that code. This generates your 20 second long code. The website then looks at that code and the servers time to determine the code. You the  try your and if it matches you are permitted to log in. This is why you can generate codes on a phone without data and if your phones time is wrong you may not be able to log in. 
The tech that does this is all open source. Google just has the most popular app for it but 2FA isn't unique to google. I use Authy I like it more. 
So no google doesn't know what you do with other sites there servers don't get your 2FA keys. The only know what you do on their site, not others. 
Authy might know what sites you use but they don't have your codes either, you can back up your codes with them but it's all encrypted with your password client side..

You need to understand public keys and private keys.
A public key is the bitcoin address. It looks like this 1JwSSubhmg6iPtRjtyqhUYYH7bZg3Lfy1T
A private key looks like this 5KJvsngHeMpm884wtkJNzQGaCErckhHJBGFsvd3VyK5qMZXj3hS
What happens is your computer randomly generates a private key. This private key then determines the public key. The public key can not be used to determine the private key. If it could bitcoins would be, well, fucked. 
What happens when you sign a transaction is you are saying send x amount of BTC to a public key. You send details like the address you send to and the amount by signing a transaction with the private key. What this does is create a new set of text that encapsulates the transaction details. This is your signature. The network then looks at your public key and matches it to your signature which allows the network to prove you control the private key without even seeing the private key. 
Now that you understand this you can better understand a paper wallet. It has the public key on one side and the private key (preferable encrypted) on the other.
The blockchain will only recognize a public key (address) once it is used (eg. something is sent to it)
As for your iPhone. Go buy an android. If you jailbreak your iPhone you could download the old .ipa of coinbase or blockchain's wallet but your putting trust in that file and that its not malware as they don't have an official one (for some stupid reason) You can also log into a web wallet on your phones browser but this isn't really any good for sending coins as you can't scan a QR code as far as i know. But if you want someone to sell you bitcoins this way then that's good.

I just did a little research seems that every bank in the US has interest rates on their savings accounts that are below the rate of inflation. Even on the highest interest rate accounts. In Canada only the big banks have interest rates bellow the rate of inflation but many small banks offer high enough interest rates that you actually *gain* money as these interest rates not only make up for inflation but also give you money. In the US CDs also have roughly no profit where as GICs in Canada (our equivalent) have much higher rates. Guess there really is a difference. Can anyone explain this?

PayPass/PayWave is what this report is all about. Most of the time when you get a credit card now you get chip+pin where to make a purchase you insert the card and type in your PIN to approve it. However no such pin or even the utilisation of the chip is required for small purchases if paying using PayPass which is a wireless technology that permits you to pay simply by hovering your card over the POS terminal. It is meant to be quick and convenient which is why it doesn't ask for a PIN. A PIN defeats the purpose of being convenient. Due to the ability for someone to steel your card and spend without a PIN PayPass/PayWave are only permitted for small purchases under I think it's $50.

Bitcoin has optional fees and transactions with the highest fees get the highest priority. Currently sending a no fee transaction is considered slow and won't be confirmed in 10 min. A fee of 0.0002 BTC (6 cents) is a very common amount now. Given that it costs the same fee to send $1 as it does $1 million then people like to make the claim Bitcoin is no fee.

I'm on mobile I'm not watching an hour long video. Why should I? 
@_date: 2014-03-07 23:20:00
I think the splitting  once per hour might have to do with confirmation. 6 confirmations take 1 hour. Not sure why they would need to wait for 6 but they may have reasons. Perhaps they have software written to do this and that's included as a safety measure. Not sure. But it's not like waiting one hour will do much in terms of the age of the coins. Unless the network is more sensitive than I had expected. 
Other than that what you say sounds logical. Not sure if coin days would be the reason for doing it though. It seems many services use multiple addresses to process withdrawals. 
Perhaps it has to do with splitting the load across servers? Let some servers handle a certain set of keys. I'm not an expert in the subject, would need a Dev or someone who runs an exchange 
@_date: 2014-04-20 03:11:30
In regards to transparency [I refer to this]( now yes they are high in fees and they also explained a fair amount during the Senate hearing, though I didn't I liked everything they had to say.
Overall what else am I going to do? I'm not going to send a wire to bitstamp. Good luck buying a bunch with quickbt. As things stand they are offering an overall good service. They haven't fucked me over. They're a place to buy and sell bitcoins for CAD. If your goal is day trading why would you even consider them? Bitstamp and BTC-e have lower fees and higher volume. Besides CAD/BTC has roughly no volume on any exchange.

@_date: 2014-06-14 20:23:57
No wires yes. Though those banks are pretty full service. With Tangerine I know you can still receive a wire. This is where it would be in your interest to use one of the online banks as your primary bank and then hold either BMO's pay as you go account or an other big banks $4/month account for on the occasion that you do need it. The $4 account covers 10 transactions per month with Scotia being the exception covering 12. Considering that you make more than $4 in interest holding your monthly minimum on CDF's 1.9% interest account or peoples trust 3% TFSA then this is worth it. I my self still maintain a BMO account simply so I can use Interac Online (different from email money transfers). 
In my opinion the only reason to stick with a big bank as your primary account  is if you do several email money transfers per month. Since most banks charge between $1 - 1.50 for this service. With RBC for example they have a $15 plan that covers 15 email transfers for free and it is unlimited transactions, much like the direct banks. So in this case the account pays for it's self, especially since they will give you a free iPad for signing up. Even if you use this account as primary chequeing I think it is still worth it to have a Tangerine account. It costs nothing to have and grants you free access to the Global ATM Alliance to be able to use some ATMs in other countries with no fees and Tangerine takes half the exchange rate fee on USD of all the big banks so that alone is nice, in addition to depositing cheques by taking a picture and an chequeing account that pays interest. I'll gladly boycott the big banks as a place to store my money as they offer the worst interest rates for savings in the country and only use them  in the areas where they actually do serve me better than the competition.

To put this into perspective. The 6 confirmations that was overall standard before 3 was instated as it would theoretically take 10% or more of the networks hashing power to change those blocks.

It's still great for anonymity even if it isn't a .onion, though you will want to make sure you connect to a site over HTTPS in case of a compromised exit node (this wouldn't reveal the the users IP but could still read unencrypted content). 
By using .onion sites it means the traffic never exited the TOR network and as such all .onion sites are encrypted by default and aren't subjected to this risk of not being encrypted, no HTTPS is required. A .onion site's main benefit is to the host as the server is hidden meaning uncensored websites. Then as I said, even if unencrypted traffic goes through a compromised exit node this doesn't reveal a users IP address, their anonymity is still present, it does however allow the exit node to discover the contents of the packets being transmitted. This is why TOR Browser Bundle comes with HTTPS Everywhere installed so that it forces sites (which support it) to use HTTPS. I suppose the use of .onion domains probably helps reduce the load on the network also as it never exited the network, people have no issue running a relay node however running an exit node is risky business.

What we are seeing today and will be more present in the future is two different competing models. Those who keep their private keys in their control and those who hand it off to a company and companies that find a middle ground. 
Most people are not responsible enough to hold bitcoins. I don't mean I mean the rest of the world. My dad is scared of using online banking for example. When a service can hold them for you then it's like a bank. The general public is safer that way. With multisig you have the best of both worlds. Someone who controls your funds but also doesn't control your funds. 
Is it safe to use Coinbase as a wallet. Sure, I rather like it. But I want the majority of my funds to be in my control since I have the ability to do so and so I do have the private keys to my investment amount.
With a web wallet you are also more prone to hackers.
Even if you are 99.999% sure you can trust the wallet provider. If you have the ability to be independent of them then why not do so?

You can configure Electrum to TOR. Alternatively Multibit works as a good solution here. It doesn't download the whole blockchain but it's also not a thin wallet relying on a server.

Banks won't do that, for starters, people would have to start taking Bitcoin seriously if banks spend billions to try and oppose it. Things have a strange way of working where the more you fight something the more known it becomes. 
Second of all. So your seriously think and the banking cartels at a whim can just spend that money and magically have miners for them selves like that? This shit takes time and research to build. In the meantime the hash rate only goes higher. 
Then what happens if by chance they have enough money and hardware to build ASICs to take on Bitcoin. They effectively can disrupt nay SHA-256 coin. So everyone will move to Litecoin (scrypt) if they build new hardware to hash scrypt then there's Scrypt-N coins, and x11 etc. It goes on, it never ends. Bitcoin has been invented and it can't be uninvented only more resilient.

I often find that direct banks have even better interest than credit unions and overall serve me better. Just boycott the big banks. Big American banks make me laugh.

The minimum balance is comparing unlimited transactions at a big bank to free unlimited transactions at tangerine or other online bank and then having  a lower cost account at small bank if needed. I was comparing business account savings at tangerine. Personal wise you avoid big banks like the plague always better rates on savings. And do you mean by instantly? Transfer between savings and chequing is instant with tangerine. You can have access to your money just as fast as with any other bank with tangerine. For a business perspective big banks are often best for chequing. But personally the highest interest I can get at a big bank is 1% on tfsa or non registered account. But going to smaller Internet banks I get 3% on tfsa and 1.9% on non registered. That is by all means worth it to me. Having a free chequing account at tangerine since it suites all my needs is worth it to me.

I recall when that shooting in Connecticut happened and the media went all out on saying how the shooters mother was a teacher and filed in a motive that by killing the kids that he was killing an image of his mother.  Turns out none of it was true and it was all bull shit. It was based on a few people being misinformed and it spread like wild fire.

There used to scripts that would allow for mining in the browser. They where of course more efficient with scrypt coins due to the difficulty thing. Probably wouldn't make much profit off that now, besides you would need to have a large following for it to make you any money really. 
Last I heard of something like this happening was some Dev that made a PS3 media centre app so he added the option of mining litecoin in it to support development. Maybe this is the approach multibit should be taking, background mining
On your own a computer won't make you any money with bitcoin now days, but a few million people running the app at the same time with mined coins adding up that ought to do it.

They do it for convenience. PayPass and PayWave have a maximum limit usually about $25-$50. It's used for the purpose of small quick purchases. A card with a PIN if skimmed however can't be used without the PIN. I assume that while the info they took in that video gives the card and would allow someone to replicate the card they couldn't get enough info to replicate a PIN requiring transaction (I could be wrong). Still the real card number is exposed which is the problem. An easy solution here for the banks would to be to make the card with two different credit card numbers. One used in Chip+PIN transaction and an other used for PayPass/PayWave that only permits purchases of a small size and declines all others.

It's important because in Australia they ruled that sales tax applies to Bitcoin. Could your imaging paying a tax to buy Bitcoin on top of the fees you already pay? Then when you go buy something at a store you pay sales tax on the product purchased, then when the merchant wants to exchange those Bitcoins to dollars he must pay an other tax. With triple tax it is devastating to Bitcoin when we hail it as a payment network with 0% fee. 
So this is a huge issue, making it legal tender would make the sale and purchase of goods more like paying in dollars it would then effectively render Bitcoin once again a useful payment network.

Well to be fair. It's not card issuers that are threatened. It's more payment processors or the networks. Let me explain.
For starters a network doesn't need to charge a high fee. In Canada for example debit cards all use the Interac network which is a non profit. The fee charged by them is only $0.006362 per transaction. This is less than the Bitcoin transaction fee. This illustrates how fiat doesn't need to be expensive. The difference is that with fiat you need to be trusted to join the network. I my self can not join the Interac network to sell something because I am not trusted. Instead I need to go though a payment processor as they are trusted. These payment processors charge a fee which then does impose a cost to the merchant (although in the case of debit cards it is extremely low) on top of the network fee. The card issuer made no money from the transaction. Only the payment processor.
Now Bitcoin is an open network which doesn't require trust to join. This is where the threat is. Right now people use payment processors like Bitpay and Coinbase as it makes their life easier and primarily to avoid volatility. Should volatility decrease any one can accept Bitcoin without worry much like you would accept cash. This cuts out the need of a payment processor when all you need to do is download a free app. This is not to say payment processors won't be around then but they must drop fees significantly and offer quite the premium service in order to still exist and compete with free. 
Now of course with credit cards this is different as the network takes a high fee. They are also a global network. Bitcoin threatens this should a card issuer like BMO go ahead and start selling bitcoin. Now they can make a bitcoin credit card that is global and charges roughly no fees. But once again no threat to card issuer in that most people won't want to keep all their bitcoin on them. If they trust a bank to keep their money safe they will. The bank only benefits as customers now will use the cards more as merchants are more accepting of them.  The bank will make just as much off consumers as they do now (unless said bank is also a payment processor, looking at you Chase)

Circle is free but they pass credit card processing fees onto you. This fee varies by credit card but is typically about 2-3%. Note that in addition to this unless you are using a USD credit card you will most probably be paying foreign currency transaction fee, expect this to be 2.5%. Also Circle is classified as money orders by Visa/MC so if your bank treats money orders as cash advances it will count as cash advance and any other fees which might be applicable to money orders.

He's not even being tried for murder charges. Initially they charged him for it and used the murder charges to slander his name in the media and deny him bail. They then dropped the charges because it's bull shit. Why would a federal prosecutor accuse someone of murder then just throw the charges out the window if there was any actual evidence to support that. Murder for hire is a much better chance of conviction than drug dealing online.
 While it's true that all of what I said happened in the New York court for this federal trial there is one sperate charge for murder for hire in a Maryland court. This trail is not on going as the New York one currently is and there is reason to suspect that the Maryland charges will go out the window just the same as the others.

When I say cash I mean hard cash. Paper bills. They are still reliant on a bank to send euros online. You are not reliant on a bank to pay someone in cash. But you can not pay someone in cash online because you can not teleport paper over Internet. 
Sending fiat online is still credit. If it's not physical money and is in a bank or is credit, though it gets played off as debit.

Not necessarily. There's been 73557 transactions over the past 24 hours. Now if everyone paid a fee of 0.0001 BTC this means 7.3557 BTC of fees paid. There was also 151 blocks mined over the last 24h (or 3775 BTC). So if the transaction volume increased by say, 513 times (3775/7.3557)  the amount of transactions then you would be seeing the same block reward as today with the same amount of fees paid.  This means you would need 37,750,000 transactions over a 24h time span or 436 per second. Now Visa handles 2,000 transactions per second on average. So that's entirely feasible (as long as Bitcoin overcomes that 7 transactions/s limit).
Satoshi was genius by making the block reward half every 4 years, in doing so Bitcoin gradually decreases the supply as it's popularity increases. The block rewards subsidizes transactions at a time when transaction volume isn't able to fund the network. As volume increases it becomes less of a problem and the block reward slowly decreases to reach the limited supply we desire.

Simply put the US has no fast payment network and US banks aren't looking to innovate around that. ACH is slow and that's the Feds job to fix. Credit card use in the US is high and banks make a huge amount of profit off of credit card transactions. When you pay by credit card 3 groups take a cut. The card issuer, the payment network (eg. Visa), and the payment processor. That's a hugely profitable business for banks. 
Now this compares to a country like Canada where EFT is just as slow as ACH.  However Canadian banks did something different. They innovated around the slow bank transfer infrastructure and created a new network (Interac) that benefits consumers and allows for a not for profit debit card network (which is instant and has network fee lower than Bitcoin), then in addition to that created email money transfers that allow anyone to send and receive money from any bank/credit union in the country near instantly though an email and then Interac Online of which Bitcoin exchanges love as it allows for instant deposits. Sadly Interac Online isn't supported by most banks but the email transfers and debit card network is supported by all banks and CUs. 
The not for profit Interac debit network was wide spread before the other innovations and Canadians are actively encouraged through advertising to use their Interac debit card and spend their own money rather than borrow with credit. So banks aren't as driven by profit for the stock holder in respect to credit cards but instead they did something that benefits the consumer as the consumer wasn't going to use the credit card anyways. American banks are to driven by the momentum and profit of credit card use (and even debit card use in the US which is also Visa and what not unlike Canada) to go ahead and innovate around the problem and create a system that subverts the slow and expensive credit card network. Instead America is relies on the Fed to update ACH and banks have no motivation to create a work around.
At least, that's my interpretation.

If this becomes an inconvenience maybe your can have two different wallets at 2 if 3 as you described and a 3 of 4  which acts as a reserve? Maybe the reserves keys aren't even held by the payment team but across multiple individuals in corporate positions. Given volatility which isn't always upwards keeping a large reserve would be a questionable decision.

It allows for a measurement of the size of the bitcoin ecosystem. If the prices goes up $50 that's nice but if the price goes up $50 knowing that an extra 50,000 coins came into circulation that means far more. Market caps allows for an easy to measure increase in price relative to the supply.

The misunderstanding here is with the term TFSA. Not everyone realizes this but a TFSA is multiple things. This is why we aren't agreeing with each other because we are taking about two different things and subsequently don't understand each other. 
It's really just a government tax break saying anything inside it is tax free gains. It is an umbrella term. There are several thing that can be contained in a TFSA. These include GICs, Mutual/index funds,  ETFs and savings accounts. You are comparing ROIs on mutual funds. All rates I said above are on savings accounts that give tax free interest. 
Yes a mutual fund at any big bank or even tangerine mutual fund can be giving you 9% rate of return. This is not interest, if the stock market crashes you can easily be down -20% like in 2008. When your TFSA is a savings account you gain interest but it is zero risk. If the stock market crashes you loose nothing. The big six banks are all between 1% to 1.005% on TFSAs that are savings accounts which have have no risk at all. Tangerine and PC is 1.3% with current promotional rate of 2.5% till end of next month. CDF is 2.25% and Peoples Trust is 3% which is the highest in the country. No risk at all and all the deposits in TFSAs above are CDIC insured so even if the bank failed you would still have all your money and the earned interest. 
This comparison of 3% of a zero risk TFSA compared to a mutual fund inside a TFSA that carries risk and is 9% is comparing apples and oranges. This is the misunderstanding you and I have. I am talking about something  that is a lower rate of return in exchange for having  absolutely no risk what so ever where you are talking low to medium risk funds for higher return.

Dam. So your talking about ACH transfers? Banks scam you so much then in the US then. 
Obviously international transfers would cost you but domestic that's nuts. In Canada and it seems many other countries it's free for a domestic transfer. I routinely transfer between accounts I have at different banks because no matter where you live you always get the most benefit from having several accounts. Not only do the savings accounts here have much higher interest rates but they don't charge monthly fees for having ones like big US banks do. EFT (ACH equivalent) are free. Don't know about if you do it at a branch I've only even done them online. Branches might charge for that stuff. 
I know banks in America suck but are direct banks doing that too? Do zero fee banks like Ally and CapitalOne 360 still charge you for domestic transfers?

The guy placed a limit order for approximately 30k Bitcoin. 
Essentially he went ahead and put on auction 30k Bitcoin at a price of $300. If he did a market order (dumping the coins) he would of eaten up the order book and prices would of crashed to very low and he wouldn't of made as much money. 
So what this guy did was make a sell wall. Essentially with the Bitcoin market being as illiquid as it is he couldn't sell all his Bitcoin quickly. Much rather he listed them at the desired price which then required people to buy from him. The prices couldn't go higher than his listing as the volume of his trade is far greater than the volume the exchange typically sees. As such traders couldn't bring up the price above $300 even if there was enough demand to typically do this because about 30k (roughly $9 million) of Bitcoin needed to be eaten through for prices to go higher.
This all happened on Bitstamp but all exchanges fallow suit more or less, if not there would be huge arbitrage opportunities. If for example you had $50k in Bitstamp you could of bought at $300 and sold in Bitfinex for more imediatly after for a higher price because traders on Bitfinex are able to breakthrough the sell orders far easier as there isn't a huge sell wall.  The term Buy wall or Sell wall come about because it looks literally like a wall on a graph that maps the depth of the order book. Here's the [buy wall that this whale made]( Contrary, [the order book on Bitstamp currently looks like this.]( It's a measurement of how many Bitcoin you can obtain for a certain price, because while the price might currently be $325 there isn't enough sell orders to accommodate that price for a large volume, much rather you would need to pay more to get more Bitcoin. 
I might of gone a little 12 year old on you there so hopefully you understand.

I always get a Good laugh at the US banking market. Not necessarily because in Canada the big banks here alone often 10 times the interest of big banks in the US but primary because big US banks offer interest so low that checking accounts at direct banks beat out Chase's and Bank of America's savings account interest rate. I advise you look at  Internet Bank USA rewards checking and CapitalOnes checking. Ally best for savings but in US sometimes you can actually get checking with higher rates than savings.

According to the article yes. Though it's troubling [how that article calculates inflation.](


There's a lot more to inflation than just exchange rate. One notable example would be Japan. For example in 2013 Japan saw the Yen devalue by 18% relative to the USD. In 2012 it went down 11%. [The Yen keeps going down]( look at 2012 to now you can see that the yen went down 34%. 
If we look at this even after deducting the 2% or so inflation in the US if basing this solely on exchange rates then we can conclude that Japan would of seen a rate of inflation around 10-15% or so over those years. However it didn't. [Instead Japan saw a rate of deflation of 0.1% in 2012 and a rate of inflation of 1.61% in 2013.](
If you look across the Eurozone you will also see that despite different countries all using the Euro they have different rates of inflation. 
The premise the article is based on in respect to the rate of inflation is flawed.

Yes and no. If it's HTTPS then it is encrypted and an exit node can't read your password. If it's not this isn't the case. Blockchain supports HTTPS and TOR (if you are using TOR Browser Bundle) comes with HTTPS Everywhere (add-on) installed out of the box. TOR can not protect you from theft of your Bitcoin, securing your connection to the Internet anonymous does not secure  your computer nor authentication to a website. It simply hides whose Bitcoin it is, not someone's ability to steel them. 
Edit: I just looked, although blockchain.info supports HTTPS it doesn't go the HTTPS by default. Blockchain.info also isn't included in HTTPS Everywhere's list of sites supporting HTTPS, that said it means that unless you manually add it to that list if you simply type in blockchain.info in TBB it isn't encrypted an an exit node can read your password.

Price grew way to fast to be sustained. Remember that even with Bitcoin being down -55% YTD it is still up 63% over a year. We don't even know if $1000 was justified by demand. Just look at all the manipulation that was going on with Mt. Gox at the time (look up the Willy report). it's fair to say it's inevitable that Bitcoin has gone down so low. My self I still feel this current price is a little undervalued and think $400 is within sight.

You would essentially trade your normal bitcoins for the colour coins on an exchange just as you would do so to buy an alt-coin like litecoin or dogecoin.
Once you have made a trade you can then withdraw to your colour coin wallet. You would be holding them there just as you hold bitcoins with your own private key. So the holding of your digital goods is entirely on you and are not handed over to any other authority. So just like bitcoins no one can seize your stocks  or freeze your funds. You could also send stocks between two different wallets for no more than the transaction fee and no one can stop a transaction from taking place. 
Colour coins are basically bitcoins within bitcoins.

The banks aren't monopolies. There are 5 big banks in Canada? 90% of the time I don't want to use any of them, so I don't. Big 5 banks all  offer same 1% interest on both TFSA and HISA savings accounts. Maybe you think that's a monopoly (or oligopoly). But it's not because there are [29 schedule one banks] (  in Canada. The are 394 credit unions. 
Maybe you think that there is an *oligopoly* because you think that you must use one of the big 5 banks. But that's not true. More banks service you nation wide than you think. Specifically through the channels of mortgage brokers and [direct banks.](  which adds significantly increased competition in the banking sector because of the Internet.

**The banks are far from monopolies**
The US has even more banks than Canada and far more competition and banks that service you in your town than you think, because you don't need a branch to have an account and you don't need to book an appointment to sign up for something to get it.

And Synchrony banks 0.95% on their savings account (which is available to everyone nationwide and is FDIC insured.) that's far from a monopoly. 
The discrepancy between banks and competition available to you is actually quite astonishing and you'd never know. You live in the delusion of an oligopoly because you where never looking not to. You'd be shocked at the amount of competition their actually is for **actually** competitive interest rates and free no fee chequing  accounts.
 You live in the delusion of an oligopoly (not monopoly) because you where never looking not to. Operating on an out dated mind set that the only banks there are are household names which are conveniently located down the street form you leading to how you think there are monopolies.

You don't need to pay the conversion fee. If you charge everyone in Swiss Franks then the consumer pays the conversion fee. 
I understand the reason for charging in USD if most customers of yours are American. If this is the case it will probably cost you less to collect money in USD then hold it as such in PayPal it bank account then buy bitcoin on Coinbase  (or what ever charges lower fees) , send those bitcoins to an exchange in you county to convert to local currency. Since most exchanges have prices nearly tied to USD this means you do not lose out on anything for the exchange rate. 
Of course just use Bitpay to get those customers that desire the option and use Bitcoin in the background for your currency exchanging/transfer to reduce your operating costs.

Not regulations yet. Hasn't gone though the Senate which has been studying bitcoin for quite some time some senators being rather favourable and anti regulation for bitcoin. 
I remember when Harper first tried his attempt at mandatory minimum for growing pot plants. They wanted to make it so anyone with more than 5 pot plants would have mandatory minimum jail times. They sent it to the Senate "nah, let's make that 300" . Anyways it's now 5 when they rammed it though in an omnibus bill no one read. Just thought I'd mention that...

I don't get why my comment got so downvoted. 
I'm simply referring to how the more things on the TOR network the more stress it takes and therefore the more TOR nodes must be running. 
I'm not saying having it on TOR is bad. It's good. But now to maintain the network you need to run both a TOR node and a Bitcoin node or else TOR network will be overwhelmed.

I'm assuming debit cards, or cash? They are in Canada anyways, credit cards aren't the only payment system out there and overall they are a crappy one. 
Credit cards are shit. They charge high fees of about 2-3% and there becomes multiple middle men that take these fees. The card issuer, the payment network, and the payment processor. Then the purchase only pops up on my transaction history about 2-3 days latter because Mastercard is so slow and then when I pay the bill it takes just as long to pay because of the slow payment  network. 
With Canadian Interac debit cards (all banks cards)  the nonprofit  Interac network takes a flat rate fee of only $0.006362 which is lower than the bitcoin transaction fee. Yes payment processors will then charge fees on top of that but it is cheap. I have never been to a store in Canada that doesn't take Interac, even in small towns. Yet several small stores do not take credit card. When the purchase is made it immediately processes and is debited from my account in real time and all transaction details like place and time of purchase are available to me instantly vs in 3 days with credit card. Then there are other great services Interac has such as instant email money transfers and Interac online (a favourite for buying bitcoin instantly and supported by Vault of Satoshi for InstaBT deposits ) 
Bitcoin let's anyone join the network and we only need to trust math. This doesn't happen with Fiat. But when it comes to saying fiat is outdated/slow it doesn't have to be.

Besides anything any US government agency would do here to threaten you would be illegal and could be challenged in court companies don't have the balls to do it or don't want to. 
 At least I got to give Telus credit for that. The cops wanted to use a general warrant to gain access to text messages of someone on Telus' servers. Telus challenged this and it went all the way to the Supreme Court of Canada which then ruled that you need a wire tap warrant in order to read/intercept text messages. We can now thank Telus for our privacy (in Canada). I realize I might be comparing apples and oranges here with the different governments (heck dogs aren't even probable cause in Canada but are in the US) but my point is that what it takes is for people to want to go and challenge it. Nothing is happening now with the NSA, you see Rand Paul go off saying he wants to challenge it in court and wheres that going? Where is the mass outrage and protest?

I'm not libertarian and I still hate banks and the corporate scum fucks who run them. Though I do recognize some banks actually serve me quite well (like Tangerine for example) 
I also recognize that people are irresponsible. If we put money in the control of private corporations they are going to use that to their advantage and against me. If we put money in the control of government maybe they will be a bit better but power corrupts and people are only people. If someone has the power the fuck shit up after X amount of time they will. 
With bitcoin I trust in math. 1 + 1 will always equal 2. For the first time in humanity we have the ability to create a monetary system not run by neither private corporations or government.   Currency unbiased and without political motivates and that I like.  If people are pro fiat it's because either they are gaming the system and profiting  from it. Or they just don't understand it.

You can do everything you just said below, though I don't believe there are any wallets that integrate all of that. 
You can post date a transaction. As for wallet ID, well you can look at address you received from. You could sign something yo prove its yours. Maybe include data in op_return. 
Using several different addresses isn't an issue and addresses can be copied for use by multiple people. This can still be done with multisig. 
This doesn't really act as  NSF thing. NSF is because account is overdrawn and you are in negative, that can't be done at a protocol level. A company could offer accounts and lend money resulting in an overdraft. They then just enforce you pay it back.

The more it is used the more demand there is for bitcoins therefore the higher value. You need to it be common and popular to be a good payment network. You also need to know that you can get your dollars value worth once the bitcoins are transferred. This means you need a liquid market. To do so you need a large market cap. 
The only way bitcoin could be a good payment network without a high value is to close it off to the public and have banks agree that no matter what 1 bitcoin = X amount of dollars. I don't see that happening as it then has no backing. The moment a bank questions the liability of such a mechanism it would fail. Therefore you need to be able to sell that bitcoin to anybody and have anybody accept that it does have real value. Which once again means a liquid market.

The exchange rate shouldn't be an issue. If it takes me 5 days to send $1000 to CaVirtex and then once received I can buy BTC instantly. Then send to VOS which probably only takes 30-60 min to confirm then sell instantly but take 5 days to withdraw I didn't expose my self to fluctuations for more than 60 min. So that's not the issue. The issue is it takes 10 days to do the arbitrage meaning you can only do it twice a month as I believe it is business days that measurement. Then on top of that how much did the exchange rate fluctuate over those 10 days? Would it of been easier to just go ahead and trade over the period of two weeks vs doing bank transfers all the time.

The media caters to special interests just like any one else. This comes down to who funds them. With private media this is the media owners. With public media the government. Media isn't afraid to criticize those who do not fund it. This is why RT is good at exposing truth in criticizing the US government but does a shit job on anything related to Russia. 
In Turkey during the protests it was gaining international media attention. In Turkey though it wasn't. CNN Turkey is literally showing a documentary on penguins but a TV next to it on CNN international is showing police brutality in the streets. As a result a penguin wearing a gas mask became a symbol of the protests. Why? Because in Turkey the media is owned by the the construction companies and runt construction companies make their money off of government contracts. So they don't want to piss off the government and lose their source of revenue. 
Want to learn about the media? Listen to The Joe Rogan Experience with Amber Lion a former CNN reporter that exposes all the bullshit corporate self censorship that goes on there. Listen to the one with Abby Martin a RT reporter who has openly criticized the Russian government (who funds the channel) and the episode with Cenk Uygur that talks about the bullshit that goes on at MSNBC and how they offered to double his salary just to shut him up. Then go read the book You Are Being  Lied To: A Disinformation Guide which has a good section on the media. 
Regardless this doesn't relate to Bitcoin. CNN has been nothing more than supportive of Bitcoin in general.

It's a way of assigning a unique property or "color" to a set of bitcoins. You would do this to a satoshi, such a small unit of bitcoin it is worthless on its own but with a unique ID to it or "color" this allows it to be traded independent of bitcoin prices as a stock that is still secured by the bitcoin blockchain. In a sense it is a bitcoin within a bitcoin. 
This is not to be confused with coin validation or red/black listing coins. That is far different.

We aren't run by UK though our political system is based off that of the UK. But unlike in the US the prime minster isn't elected.

Then who ever is the leader of that party is Prime minister. So while Canada can get rid of the Conservatives by voting the only way he can not be the leader of that party is for the people in his riding of Alberta to vote him out.
Harper is just an other MP. He's not a president he is like all the other elected politicians in parliament.

Yes it has an effect on fees. The transactions with higher fees have higher priority. If a miner says 500kb a block and there are 1 MB worth of transactions wanting to fit in with higher fees being prioritized this means people need to pay higher fees or else their Bitcoins are no longer instant.

If I was sitting on millions of dollars of Bitcoin, I'm going to have a selling point eventually. Think of that 30k BTC bearwhale. The redistribution of wealth in action. You don't be rich and not want to spend anything. 
The farmer would have his savings go up and be able to buy more. The problem with this sort of system is being paid. If the value of a currency goes up then your wage must be reduced to make up for that. If not then it is inoperable to do business when you keep being paid in significantly increased value of purchasing power. This doesn't seem to be any problem for Bitcoin anytime soon as every transaction when it occurs be it buying or selling is really based on fiat currency and the real time exchange rate of Bitcoin. 
Bitcoin tries to resemble a precious metal. A digital gold standard. Also remember, while your government might be responsible at printing money don't think all others are. Look at Argentine or Venezuela. Even then those are just the tip of the ice burg. Look at Zimbabwe which saw hyper inflation. Bitcoin is simply limiting the role of banks and government based on a belief that no one should have the unlimited issuing authority of currency because we can't trust them to be fully responsible. Bitcoin creates a system which requires no trust for a functioning money supply. In this sense it is a trustless system. Fiat is a trust based system.

See while you can't pay for the movie in Bitcoin on Vimeo or iTunes what does happen is if you go off and pay on iTunes the credit card companies and Apple take a fee and have operating expenses due to the hosting costs of the files. So in this sense if you Torrent it then there are no hosting costs involved as it is P2P and you can  just  donate the price of that film directly to the producers by using their Bitcoin donation address and now we have entirely  decentralized distribution of contented with no middle men involved at all and no fees being charged by them.

**Basic Explanation**
Bitcoin uses a P2P network to establish a decentralized anonymous system of trust, something that has never before existed. This creates a pseudonymous public ledger of transactions that is then used to verify payments and account holdings all the while being free from manipulation of anyone. (meaning no blocking of payments, no freezing of funds, no fees for transactions)
This technology also allows for digital payment but directly from payer to payee 
@_date: 2014-06-09 23:02:51
The amount mined diminishes because of the increase in computing power. This is why difficulty goes up so that no matter what the computing power is of the network a block is always as difficult as 10 minutes takes to solve it.

You have no idea where my comment is coming from or what I'm talking about. There already is a limited supply of Bitcoin and by all means it's necessary to keep that. 
Your comment says:


Not  "don't issue *more* coins", but much rather that you are saying don't issue any at all (at least that's how it sounds). 
Every Bitcoin transaction right now is subsidized heavily by the block reward. The true cost of a transaction is around $20 but you can pay only 1 mBTC simply because the block reward subsidizes the transaction. Satoshi was genius in how he implemented this. Start at 50 BTC reward and then half every 4 years. In doing this it allows for a heavy subsidization of transactions at the start of Bitcoin creation and progressively reduces this subsidization as Bitcoin becomes more popular and fulfils more transactions then the transaction fee slowly becomes enough to fund the miners and still be able to remain a minuscule cost. This way hash rate increases to secure the network and you pay practically no fee.

Decentralized applies to how bitcoin works, it doesn't apply to centralized business. Can you really expect bitcoin to take off and be useful if preexisting business can't use it?

They won't block all forms of encryption and you can sometimes pull off one form as an other. For example just changing VPN to TCP 443 will fool most firewalls into viewing it as regular HTTPS traffic. By letting a user have access to a VPN that has an open network with net neutrality (possibly in a different country) then you're good. Sure a ISP could always throttle that but unless they throttle all traffic then there is a way around that.

Simple. Coinbase has the resources and are experienced in auto fiat conversion. They also sell Bitcoin to users which gives them added liquidity in the exchange market in addition to the exchanges Coinbase partners with. PayPal could build this from the ground up but given Bitcoins relatively small user base why should PayPal go though the effort of finding liquidity partners and coding it all when they have experienced pros at Coinbase that have proved themselves eager to help in the development process when integrating Bitcoin to other platforms? 
The other reason becomes marketing and consumer behaviour. Why does Netflix and PSN process their own payments in house but also accept PayPal? Why does Google Play offer PayPal depite their competing Google Wallet? The answer is because there is a user base. To Americans in the Bitcoin community and specifically noobs that enjoy Coinbase's ease of buying  and storing Bitcoin Coinbase becomes a familiar brand. Although Coinbase works perfectly fine with any Bitcoin payment method by integrating Coinbase you carry over Coinbase's user base. Add to this the ease of logging  into Coinbase very simply vs copy and pasting messy Bitcoin adresses into thin wallets on your phone and it creates ease of use. With Bitcoin on its own PayPal caters to themselves. With Coinbase they cater to the masses and earn additional users. Perhaps they feel Coinbase will become more recognizable to the public than bitcoin it's self (kind of how many Cypriots vied Neo &amp;  Bee to be the same thing as Bitcoin).

So someone correct me if I'm wrong. The way I understand it usually the addresses are created in a predictable manner. So you have a random seed essentially. But from that seed addresses are created in a linear progression. So you will always start with address A, followed by B, and C, D, etc. This means when you restore from the seed it restores the addresses In the same manner they where originally generated. The wallet can then check the balance of all of them and know what addresses have Bitcoin and which have been used. It can then fallow this linear time line of generated address and arrived at a point where it can see that the next few address afterwards haven't been used yet and are thus clean. It can then assume that therefore those future address can be ignored and all future possibilities do not need to be checked. 
So for example, I'm not sure how many address an HD wallet can generate but let's say it is 10,000. Now when you restore your wallet can check address one, then address two, three, etc. Then it arrives at 200 and notices that 201, 202, 203, 204, 205 have never been used, maybe it  checks until 400 to be sure. Now since they are always generated in such a linear fashion there is no need to check address 206-1000. This also preserves those address for future use so you don't accidentally use them over again.

Most investors would not take on a market as volatile as Bitcoin and are considered crazy to do so. Go make an ETF portfolio 60% bonds, 20% US equity and 20% international equity and rebalance semi-annually.

Vault of Satoshi and CaVirtex are already MSBs, FinTrac has said that bitcoin isn't in their jurisdiction yet exchanges have been treating it as if it is. I don't see them being required to be MSBs a problem and it is likely inevitable. 
Any other statements saying all companies dealing with Bitcoin just to accept it is a far stretch and a slippery slope argument. Tim Horton's doesn't need to be a MSB to accept debit cards and nor would they for Bitcoin. The senate is doing an extensively long study on bitcoin which spans several months so not only does this give lots of time to bitcoin start ups but looking at how the senators have been pretty understanding of Bitcoin so far and some have been pretty anti-regulation on the matter I'm not to scared.
I don't see much on this site sighting any references. The finance minister at the time who is responsible for the budget bill which mentioned updating these laws and bitcoin for that mater has since died. The excerpt on that was also very vague.
I won't be shitting bricks until I see any sold legislation and so far and quite likely in the future any regulations here will be far looser than in the US and cheaper to comply with.

Don't know if you are in Canada or not but Interac Online deposit's a new method they just launched yesterday is literally Instant. This is also the method of online payment the Canada Revenue Agency takes for paying taxes. This also costs the exchange very little to offer and they are the first actual exchange in the country to do this.  Then they offer it for free for this promo. Banks offering this do not charge customers a fee for using it either. 
Compared to the legacy banking system that charges people high fees for international wire and is slow for even domestic transfer taking up to 5 days. Then this instant deposit and buy is revolutionary. Bitcoin is an instant currency. Nice and fast and now the entire problem of getting dollars into Bitcoin without suffering from fraud or because dollars are slow has completely vanished in Canada.

To be fair. BitPay does service Canada and is 0%. There are issues with this though. For starters BitPay was changing their banking relations in Canada. This meant that they ended immediate transfer to bank and instead required a minimum of $1000 accumulated before payout. I'm not sure if this has yet changed and if they now pay out on even small amounts. Also while BitPay is a registered MSB with Fincen (US) they are not a MSB registered with Fintrac (Canada). While currently it is perfectly legal in Canada for them not to be a MSB this is expected to soon change. While it's not too costly for them to comply with the small Bitcoin market we can't just assume that they will. There is competition, QuadrigaCX offers merchant services (and other exchanges do to a degree as well) but these options aren't free. Really tough the biggest hurdle is consumers. It's not to hard to get Bitcoin for about 0.4% fee in Canada. But that's still a fee, add to that volatility and the consumer has no reason for Bitcoin in place of debit. 
Now sure Bitcoin is cool and all and I love holding them and it's nice if more merchants accept them. But for domestic payment Bitcoin for the average Joe doesn't seem like an advantage at check out (online aside where Interac isn't very prevalent and Bitcoin drastically reduces the risk of fraud). Where Bitcoin really shines is international money transfer.

This doesn't necessarily mean higher fees. Like I said my bank didn't charge me or my friend to make that transfer. 
Bitcoin companies like Coinbase already do what you call off-chain transactions. This is because Coinbase has their own ledger apart from the blockchain. This allows for instant confirmation between Coinbase accounts. It also allows Coinbase to Coinbase to bypass the Bitcoin network transaction fee.
 In addition to speed by Coinbase having a different  ledger this means if I send X Bitcoin into Coinbase and from Coinbase send transaction Y then there is no link on the blockchain between transaction X and transaction Y as it is a different pool of Bitcoin but Coinbase on their internal ledger links X and Y, this means Coinbase knows where I sent money but not the public that can monitor the Bitcoin blockchain.
Some people will always want to hold Bitcoin independent of an institution like Coinbase because of a Mt Gox like situation where the internal ledger is different from what the blockchain's ledger (their reserves) say they actually have. Bitcoin though allows for banks to have their own instant internal ledgers and bridge the gap between their ledger and other banks with Bitcoin as Bitcoin is very fast and global. Bitcoin though is beautiful as I do not need a bank to interact with Bitcoin's ledger, I am granted direct access.

That's beyond their control. CIBC would need to get on board with Interac online. For solutions to this problem BMO has a pay as you go account that has no monthly fee but charges a buck per transaction. You could do Interac e-transfer to BMO. This way you can deposit into VOS and it only takes a half hour from end to end. 
Both BMO and Scotia also have $4 account that covers 12 free transactions. BMO waives that fee for minimum deposit (of $1000) I don't think Scotia does. 
If you want to switch RBC is having a promo for $15 dollar a month account but they give you free iPad mini. They only require you to have the account until (I think)  August 2015 to not be sent the bill for the iPad. So in that sense it pays for it's self. This plan also covers 15 free Interac e-transfers so if you use that a lot it is worth it. 
The only reason I keep BMO account really is Interac Online as I use Tangerine as primary chequeing.

That would actually be brilliant. Would let you buy so much and from merchants that don't even have a clue about bitcoin. You wouldn't be purchasing with bitcoin but as means of transfer that would be great. Would save PayPal a lot on fees also. Especially if you could withdraw in bitcoin.

My self I am under the impression Coinbase hustled Dell out of what could of been the best thing to ever happen to them. Coinbase likely convinced Dell to deal with them where they otherwise would not have accepted Bitcoin. They may have provided help like with Overstock where Coinbase sent in a team to work day and night to integrate Coinbase. 
Coinbase is USD and English only, first $1,000,000 free then 1% thereafter. 
**Meanwhile with BitPay**


Plus BitPay also has different plans. 1% no monthly fee, or monthly fee 0% transaction fee.
Now when you think about it surly Dell does a lot of dealing in USD. When I bought Dell form Dell.ca it shipped from the US so it might be manageable to do Canadian orders with Coinbase but presumably they still deal in CAD also. The only benefit they gain from Coinbase is the same benefit that merchants have by processing payments them self and also offering PayPal, and that's that Coinbase has user account. This adds ease of use and allows Americans buying from Coinbase to very easily buy on Dell.com with an off  chain transaction.
Once Dell has reached a million dollars processed and Coinbase starts charging 1% then they have the motivation to go international with BitPay. Also unless Coinbase or BitPay become registered as MSBs with Fintrac then under upcoming AML legislation they would most probably not be allowed to service Canada. I would expect BitPay to become a MSB in the near future.

It would but banks still would be used too. Fiat won't disappear any time soon. We are far too use to easy lending and low interest rates. In addition to that most consumers like not being in charge of their money. Banks will be around to work with bitcoin. 
Central banks have two primary missions. Be the lender of ~~last~~ first resort and facilitate transaction between several didn't financial institutions which are linked though a common bank that is the central bank. So even if banks are only fiat bitcoin works as a great medium of exchange between them.

You can't slow down bitcoin payments. It's a non issue since your can't regulate the blockchain. Its an algorithm.
Sure regulation may slow down the purchase of bitcoins with dollars. But we don't wan't a bitcoin dependent on dollars. 
If you can use all of your bitcoin holdings as payment you can not be slowed down. There is no need to use an exchange.

What? 
That's not discrimination. An MSB standard for money service business. These are money transfer services that register with FinTrac and report to them. While FinTrac doesn't require Bitcoin business to register all 3 domestic Bitcoin exchanges are already registered and with the legislation on the table we can pretty much confidently say that Bitcoin will soon be under the jurisdictions of FinTrac and such  activity will require you to be registered as a MSB. I also meant are, not age. 
I don't know what your business is doing specifically, you wouldn't need an MSB to just accept Bitcoin as a normal business but if you are offering money transfer services then you would. Despite not currently needing it now I'm sure that banks are far less likely to do business with you if you are not an MSB.

I found this. It sums it up. 
Part of the article is flat out wrong though. For example:


This is not true it is free to hold all accounts with Tangerine and accounts have unlimited transactions at no cost. Mutual funds of course have service fee but is lower then other banks. 
In addition to PC, Tangerine,  and Canadian Direct Financial all compete with each other. There are even more in regards to savings products that are offered by [direct banks] ( of the ones listed above Tangerine is the only one that serve Quebec. Many of the ones below also do though. It's Canada banks operate nation wide they only need federal licensing. But they still need to put up with Quebec language laws. Quebec is the fastest growing market for them also. 
I recommend you do what the article talks about and nit pick each bank for what products serve you best. I have more than one bank account. As far as I'm concerned the only reason to have an account at a big bank is for interac online. Like for instant deposit like to Vault of Satoshi now!    xD 
Tangerine is also pro at word of mouth marketing. Your account gets a promo code that each time someone uses it you and your friend each get $25. They also offer cheque-in and are the most full featured of all the direct banks. They are still the biggest and oldest one. They are always the ones that where there first. They have Cafés for example and 24/7 customer support. The add credit card next year. 
You should check out

Risk is far less with Interac online. The Canada Revenue Agency even accepts it as a way to pay taxes online. It isn't fraud prone like email transfers. Adam from VOS already talked this over in a reply with me. Basically you need a court order to reverse Interac online as would you for an EFT. Being that the account at the exchange is verified to be under your name and only deposits from a bank account with the same name will be excepted this makes it clear that funds are being transferred by you, to you. So the court would rule with the exchange and no fraud would take place. 
Edit: For interac online also it's not like a credit card or an EFT where you give account info and they can take the money from you. With Interac online you would need to log into online banking to approve a transaction. So you need control of that bank account also.

Fractional reserve banking could be devastating with Bitcoin as we trade bitcoins digitally. With fiat we can trade that phony credited money, sometimes digitally.

Well the thing is the wallet data is already encrypted. Electrum or Bitcoin QT you set a password. This is encrypting the private key but not the wallet file. Since you already have that encrypted then you just back it up and TrueCrypt the backup. Thus it is double encrypted, doing two different passwords make it more secure and is not really inconvenient/retarded.

Holdings of Bitcoin are decentralized with multi-sig. So long as the true owner holds the required amount of keys and a website/company while holding signing authority doesn't have complete control of the coins then ownership is decentralized. No trust is required in the company holding it. 
A 2 of 3 setup works here as signing authority is used for 1 key involved in all transactions. However if there is a dispute or this key is lost the owner who controls 2 separate keys (spending key on computer/phone) and secured backup and uses these keys to forcibly take them away from the signing authority and the signing authority. If one key is lost the remaining two can still be spent if required parties agree. 
GreenAddress.It for example uses 2 of 2. This means that if you lost your key you can't get the money. It also means that GreeAddress.It can't take your money and run with it while simultaneously you cant take it and run. Their solution to this is nTimeLock to send to a backup address at predetermined future date if Bitcoin has not been sent by then. Otherwise the Bitcoin for all intensive purposes doesn't exist unless both parties agree it does. This approach of forcing GreenAddress.It in a transaction means merchants can accept payment instantly with 0 confirmations if they feel GreenAddress.it is trustworthy. Effectively they don't need to trust the stranger that is a customer. 
The signing authority is still part of a set of keys that makes up an address. They are effectively involved the the majority of transactions or in some set ups required in all. So if this signing authority has knowledge of who you are you forfeited your privacy. Even if it doesn't know you you made it easier to track your addresses vs using a deterministic wallet.

Yeah should calcify what I meant. Not sure situation in Norway specifically. But in many countries you can get interest from small banks that is enough to at least make up for inflation. In other countries best you can do is mitigate the problem like in the US. I'm in Canada but have done research in regards to how this applies to the US as well so I'll explain these two.
Basically the rule of thumb is the less people know about a bank the greater interest you will earn. This is where [direct banks]( come in specifically. Remember that term and it will save you great heartache. I'm sure wikibot will explain it but if you're a bitcoiner then you seem to trust the internet with your bitcoins why not trust internet banks? This give you way more options. You can have an account at a bank or credit union that doesn't have any locations near you. This widens your options so much. You then interact with it using online banking. Allow me to explain or skim though the next to paragraphs. 
In Canada the big banks offer 1% interest on tax free accounts and similarly 1% on taxed accounts (the difference here is tax free has a maximum amount you can put in per year. There is no max amount it can hold just a maximum amount you can contribute to this sort of account per year.) Canada saw a rate of inflation of 0.94% in 2013 and 1.52% the year before with 2.91% in 2011. So you loose out with those big banks.  But there is a small bank in Vancouver that offers 3% interest on tax free accounts they do make it very easy though for people from anywhere in the country to sign up as they are a direct bank. Then the highest you can get on a taxed account from a couple of direct banks is 1.9% now if you want more interest then use a GIC (term deposit or CDs in the US) you can get slightly over 3% on these with a 5 year term with a direct bank. Contrary to this the big 6 banks offer roughly 2% on 5 year GICs. So in the end if you are only putting away $5500 per year (the tax free limit) then you wont face inflation at all if you are smart. If you putting away more you can greatly limit you exposure to inflation. If any Canadians are reading this [check out best rates here](
Now lets look at the US. Big banks you are seeing 0.1% from an account at the big banks. That's a joke given that the rate of inflation in the US is roughly the same as in Canada. But [Ally]( offers a rate of 0.87% on USD savings. Over 8 time higher. With [Capital One]( having a similar 0.75%. This makes a big banks account in the US a laughing stalk compared to the 0.19% interest Capital One offers on their checking account. Meanwhile If you have over $500 to save than you can earn between 1% all the way up to 2% depending on the amount deposited over at [connexus credit union](
So you get what I mean? Sorry for the rant but I'm starting to get sick of people complaining about how they get such low interest rates when they have no right to complain if they never actually shopped around. If you went to the big banks websites that's not shopping around. There's more than the banks you see on TV ads you know. Especially since direct banks cut costs a lot by not having to staff branches they pass those savings on to you.

Go, generate an address in a wallet and look it up on blockchain.info. You won't find any results for that address. Now go take an other wallet and send Bitcoin to this previously unused/unregistered address. Now, search up that address. It is now on the blockchain and the receiving  wallet did nothing. This receiving wallet could be cold storage in a vault under the ocean. It's address is still registered on the blockchain and will now forever be public.

Are you guys aware of DCA and CBD? Both have been found to kill cancer sells on various occasions in studies. They are seen as potential cancer treatments. 
CBD research is a little up in the air and probably isn't being look at that much by cancer researchers as it is found in marijuana. Legality might be an issue and some probably dismiss it despite all the studies done in the substance, it doesn't even get people high. The US government is also the one which owns the patents to this. 
DCA the university of (I think it was Alberta)  did lots of research on it that became increasingly promising however DCA is in the public domain so no pharmaceutical companies would give them the required funding. Studies on it remains dead in the water. 
I would love to donate money to someone who actually is looking for cures to cancer and who will not  just dismiss some of the most promising cures over the ability to make money off patents and therefore look at other substances. I'd like research to be done for the better good of humanity not for corporate profits.

Nope. It depends on the banks business model. You have a misunderstanding of how ING operates. You see in the Netherlands ING is just your everyday normal bank. It charges fees and it has branches, it operates on the traditional banking business model which really hasn't changed all that much since the 1800s.
[ING Direct]( (ING DiBa in Germany and Austria) operate using the [direct banking business model.]( ING Direct doesn't charge fees. Doesn't matter if you are a student, and adult, a hobo, fat, tall, rich or poor it is free. ING Direct builds its self on a very basic business model that says, we charge you no fees, we pay you money to be with us (as there is interest paid on every deposit even chequing), we are a 24/7 bank. They do this by eliminating branches which then drastically reduces operating expenses that they then pass onto you as a customer. This is known as a direct bank.
When ING first set up their direct banking division they did so in Canada. They opened an office in downtown Toronto and a Cafe, then they used the telephone and internet (I believe the became first bank in Canada to even have online banking) and then they became a bank that services the entire country all without any branches which results in very little expenses they pass those savings onto you. They then team up with an ATM network for free access to cash. In the areas where they do have physical locations (only 5 in all of Canada) it's a Cafe, it isn't a branch, it has people that can help you 
ING sold their direct banking divisions in Canada (bought by Scotiabank now [Tangerine]( US (now CapitalOne360), UK (bought by Barclays and shut down). ING Direct still operates as a no fee high interest direct bank in  Australia, Austria, France, Germany, Italy, and Spain. They focus on making happy customers which bring new customers. Word of mouth marketing is very big with them, like with their [human billboard](
**TL;DR ING outside of the Netherlands is a very different bank with free account for everyone. It operates as ING Direct, a direct bank with no fees and no branches. It is an internet only bank. [Watch this Video it explains what's up with them](
**While you in the Netherlands might think of ING as a scummy big bank that charges fees to the rest of the world it is a friendly small innovative competitor that gives them access to a competitive, banking market they otherwise wouldn't have. I'm sure you can find similar direct banks in the Netherlands also.**

Actually I live in Canada. It is publicly owned the bank of Canada and the minister of finance sits on the board of directors. There are no stock holders. Though it operates as a separate branch of government. So it's more like a government department than something the politicians control. 
Though from my understanding most of the  government bonds are sold to the big private banks. That being said there still is a debt and I'm assuming most of that money that went towards buying the bonds is coming from a fractional reserve (though I'm not an economist) and in Canada as of the 90s there are zero reserve requirements. If we just borrowed money from our selves though then we wouldn't have a debt and the inflation argument is a lie because if you actually borrow you have the intent to pay back meaning you could just remove the  excess money from supply and no unintended inflation. 
So yeah not perfect But at least it's government regulating banksters without the goal of profit vs the Fed where it's just banksters controlling banksters to gain an advantage. That and I'm Canada it's at least possible to find a savings account that out paces inflation although you need to run away from any big bank to achieve this.

you should of looked at my link man. As much as I love Tangerine (great place for chequing account and Mutual funds, AFAIK best USD exchange rate, 24/7 support, cheque-in, ect. and great for travel now that they are on Global ATM Alliance) while they beat out all the big banks on interest rates there are [even smaller internet banks that give even higher interest rates.]( Like [Peoples trust]( with the highest in the country on a TFSA with 3% they also offer 1.8% on normal savings account and there are some banks and CUs that offer 1.9%, Tangerine normal rate is 1.3% beats that out with promo rate of 2.5% so that is great for non registered account but for tax free accounts Peoples Trust rate on TFSA though is unbeatable and actually stops you from loosing money due to inflation based on the measurements from the CPI which is below 3% over past 5-10 years. I got my savings at Tangerine though I only just got the $1000 that is required for deposit to PT (its savings account not GIC you can get money when ever you want but Peoples trust does for some reason require 1k+ for deposit.)
Also have you checked out [Canadian Direct Financial]( They have great rates that beat out Tangerine also. For GICs [Oaken Financia]( is one of the best with 3% on 5 year GIC that beats out any of the other big banks or Tangerine

Now users are beyond that,  darknet markets has evolved past Silkroad for something newer, more advanced, and further decentralized (be it multisig markets or OpenBazzar).

This is only partly true. For Canadian channels yes there are quotas for Canadian content however this doesn't apply to American channels broadcasted in Canada. For example I have AMC, CNN, MSNBC, FOX, SPEED, SPIKE and so forth. While they occasionally put Canadian commercial on these channels they are still US channels. Though yes for some channels like Comedy Central, HBO, or Nation Geographic they are Canadian equivalents that must maintain some Canadian content. So I yeah I guess with Dish the incentive is to get the American version of this. 
Edit: okay I get it, the quotas are for the Cable providers not channels. So to have more US channels they would need to also create more Canadian channels.

It's not actually deposited through your debit card the way things would work with a credit card. It is done though Interac online, in other words though online banking. You click the button to deposit then it brings you to the Interac website where you choose your bank, this then brings you to your banks website to log into online banking and approve the transfer of funds. It's essentially just paying though online banking, not though a debit card like described. 
Interac online is only supported by BMO, RBC, Scotia and TD, for many TD customers it doesn't work. If you want to use this method of payment and stay with your bank [I suggest you do as I described here](

I haven't used them and I'm not Australian. I just know of them and they are Chinese based. They trade several currencies (USD, EUR, HKD, AUD, CAD, JPY,
SGD, GBP, NZD and CHF). 
Regardless of the currency you  pay no trading fees. You only pay withdrawal fees on fiat. They charge only $10 AUD + 0.5% when withdrawing, deposits are free (prices quoted are for ANX not ANXPRO). This compares to CoinJar which especially now is quite expensive in comparison. I've also noticed arbitrage opportunities with this exchange. Last I calculated if buying Bitcoin from US or Canadian exchange you can then sell on ANX for AUD or even NZD for that matter and make about a 1% profit after fees. Thus making it extremely effective for this sort of transfer. You would need to wire AUD to them. I'm assuming that they use non Australian bank that deals with AUD as well, but I could be wrong. 
I don't know Australian tax code or law. I just figured because they are off shore exchange that they don't pay their taxes to the Australian government and as such would be considered exempt from Australian sales tax and not need to charge their users while remain legal.

I  believe the concept is a trust system. You have the account under your name and the credit card info. The limit starts off low and then grows the more they learn you and start to trust you as a customer the higher amount you may transact. If after a few months you didn't see a charge back then it's safe to assume the guy isn't lying and they up the limit. They do all sorts of things to build a profile of you and evaluate your risk as a buyer and the likely hood of fraud to determine a account limit. Someone did post they just signed up and limit was $500 though. If This true and you can get $500 straight up without much  info and a credit card then yeah it's fraud prone.

Well that stops you from broadcasting a double spend transaction but doesn't do anything to prevent a problem when a longer chain beats out the current chain.

Well they would probably have to say that only criminals use it and it will be used by terrorist. But banning Bitcoin is like banning the unlawful use of copyright material. Yet, look at all the movie Torrent there are. Why, because torrents are a P2P network where it can not stop the spread of information so long as enough peers support the network. Even if you censor the internet as long as one country in the world has uncensored internet then the whole world does because there are ways to simply route your connection through to that country. 
I think the gov is slowly starting to realize that Bitcoin is effectively unstoppable. That you can't stop criminals from using it. You can't stop criminals from using cash. The Fed has even come out and talked about the benefits and usefulness of Bitcoin. The gov will try and regulate out the bad actors, they will largely fail at this, but I don't think they have incentive to ban it, because they can't, they can only make your life hard to use Bitcoin. They realize that Bitcoin has it's benefits and would like to reap the reward.

So in my life one thing I have learned is how much people succumb to brand names and brand loyalty. People ignore the competition that us right under their noes. 
I did a quick little search (literally 30 seconds on Google). The 4 biggest banks in Sweden comprise 75% of the market. Which is astonishing. If you know anything about banks you will know that more often than not the larger the bank the crappier they will treat you. 
There are 37 commercial banks in Sweden and 29 foreign banks operating in the country. Add in some other banks that offer savings only, some co-ops (only 2) get 117 banks in Sweden. According to the [Swedish Financial Supervising Authority](  On a side note here is a [list of some of those banks.] (  
Now Sweden isn't that big of a country. Even so you don't need to live near a bank to be it's customer (of only more people realized this). So, when you ask where do we go from here? You start trying an other 30 or so banks and see where things go from there.

Increasing hash rate brings huge benefit to Bitcoin as it secures the network. With the impending increase in difficulty it weeds out old miners who must then either upgrade to more efficient rigs (more hashes per watt) or stop mining. There's no denying that Bitcoin takes up a lot of power. But increase in difficulty and hash rate over time does the necessarily correlate to increase in electrical consumption. Some people will also prefer alternative schemes like PoS as a means of being more energy efficient than PoW.

Both in Canada are against the agreements. You are right in saying that there isn't a law against it. It is MC/Visa that say this. However the government has sided with MC/Visa in saying they are allowed to do this. I presume this agreement with a merchant would be a legally binding contract right? In this sense breach of contract being illegal it is effectively illegal in Canada for for merchants to add on any form of surcharge to a credit card transaction. All credit card transactions in Canada must be the same price as paid  in cash (unless merchants find a loophole by offering pay with cash get a discount). Where as this isn't the case in many other jurisdictions.

I'm not quite sure if I understand your question but a deterministic wallet would fallow a pattern of sorts. Think of it as a seed +A, then for a new address +B, other new address +C, ect. Essentially all addresses are generated in repeatable and consecutive order. While the master private key is random the addresses made afterwards aren't fully random but much rather based off the random master key. This means the order in which  new addresses will generate, or much rather what the next address will be is already set in stone. This means when restoring from an old wallet the software will look at all the first addresses that would be generated and continue to fallow the repeatable path until it finds addresses that have never before been used. Once this happens the assumption can be made that because these newest addresses haven't been used before then all consecutive addresses haven't been either. Thus all holdings of bitcoins have been restored as they are all from the first set of addresses. This make sense?

How about you learn how credit cards actually work before your start taking shit. A bank lends out money. They set the interest rate and a credit card company facilitates the transaction. The bank makes money off you from interest. This is why you need to go to a bank or other financial institution to get a credit card. The credit card company makes money by charging merchants that 3% or so when processing the transaction. Any fee you pay as a card holder goes to the bank.

People say "isn't fully legal yet" as we pretty much expect it to be in the near future  (federal election is few months away, Harper is a cunt and the next runner up is campaigning on legalizing marijuana). If legalized this means Americans with a record for marijuana charges would then be permitted into Canada (as entry is only refused if there is a similar law in Canada as what you have been charged with in your respective country) 
Regardless weed laws are pretty lax in Canada and for many other drugs as well (for example payote and ibogaine are legal in Canada). Marijuana paraphernalia and literature however  has actually been illegal for something like 30-40 years. But if you came here you'd have no idea. Head shops are all over any major city, paraphernalia sold out in the open and cops don't care or do anything. I'm to lazy to walk down the street now to High Time's but I'm pretty sure they have bank accounts and payment processors. With laws not being enforced they don't have much to worry about. 
The dispensary thing and even recreational use in Colorado is because while marijuana is legal at the state level it is illegal at the federal level. Banks fall under federal law and as such would be classified as laundering money. From my understanding though due to Obama they have started loosening up and allowing banks to do business with dispensaries. 
In Canada the medical marijuana thing is a bit wack. It is legal at the federal level in Canada. However every state in the US with a medical program has more patients than Canada as a whole due to restrictive access (unless things have changed on these stats, I may be out of date). Despite medical marijuana being legal in Canada only having the bud to smoke/vape is legal, it is illegal for one to make/consume eatables and oil despite being a MMJ patient. The government however did recently remove patients rights to grow their own pot. This however created a multimillion dollar private medical marijuana grow industry (there is now an old Hershey factory converted into a large scale grow). 
Dispensaries (referred to as companion clubs here) are also illegal though do operate out in the open while limiting them self to medical patients. They are in some cities over looked  by the police. The cops often don't care about the dispensaries depending on the city. There where some high profile raids in Montreal and Toronto few years back on compassion club. AFAIK the dispensary  in Vancouver still retains good relations with the police there where they ignore the illegal activity they do. 
Police in Canada have also straight up ask that the government change the laws and make possession only punishable by fines.

The reason  I say use https is what if the tor exit node or vpn server is comprised. This opens you up to exposure of what you are doing so you want to always use https when possible. In addition to this browsers prioritize week encryption algorithms when using TLS to secure the connection despite nearly all browsers and servers supporting high end encrypt protocols like AES256 so you also want to make sure you disable the week options or prioritize high end ones. There are websites that test your browsers preference also.

Did you check tend blockchain and does it show up in your accounts history as being sent to a specific address 
@_date: 2014-03-24 18:03:21
It's complicated. 
To sum it up the way your address works has to do with public key cryptography. 
When you generate an address you generate a private key. This private key is made entirely randomly (unless you make a custom brain wallet) There is then a public key that corresponds to this. Your bitcoin address is a public key (plus a hash for some reason.) 
While a private key can determine a public key a public key can not determine the corresponding private key. 
When someone sends you bitcoins they are sent to your public key and verified by the blockchain and miners to be held in that address.  Essentially a entry is made on the ledger that is the blockchain saying that it is proven the balance of bitcoins corresponds to a certain address.
 While we like to say bitcoins are stored on your computer or in your wallet. Really they aren't, it's more of a metaphor. They are stored no where but are recognized by the network as belonging to a certain address. Your private keys which are required to spend bitcoins are what's stored on the computer. Who ever controls the private keys controls the bitcoins. So if you control the keys no one can seize your coins unless they gain control. If coinbase controls the keys it's yours. 
When you send bitcoins you sign a transaction with the private key. Basically you say this address has 2 bitcoins let's send it to this other address. So you create a message that says send 2 bitcoins from my address to this address. To verify you own those bitcoins these transaction details are signed with your private keys. The network of miners then looks at the signature and compares it to your public key. This signature can be matched to the public key to prove that you do control the corresponding private key. This keys you prove you have a private key without exposing it to the network. If the slightest of details where changed the signature would be invalid and not transfer would occur. 
This process is greatly simplified with wallet software. You could also sign  any message you want to prove ownership of an address if you desire. The person can then use wallet software and your public key to verify this. 
In most cases your address is not listed on the blockchain unless used at least once. Once used it is broadcasted and recognized.

If the US government uses it, and the NSA has created  SHA-256 which Bitcoin is based on. Then approved AES encryption is what the US government uses to encrypt their top secret stuff and is wide spread. 
It's a little bit hypocritical to say I can't use it but they can. If it's a weapon to me it's a  weapon when they use it. Especially when you rely on channels line Wikileaks to find out what they're hiding and went. Then encryption is needed to protect your information (eg. even things like credit cards and your connection during online banking).

P2SH is multi-sig. Essentially with Bitcoin the whole network is holding your Bitcoin, however, you hold select set of keys. These keys you hold allow you to unlock the Bitcoins on the network.
Now normally you need 1 key to unlock the Bitcoin from it's corresponding address. with P2SH it says you need Y amount of keys out of a set of X amount to sign the transaction and unlock the Bitcoin.


One of the most common forums of multi-sig is 2 of 3. This is where there are 3 keys but you only require 2 of them to sign a transaction and unlock a set of Bitcoin. Bitgo for example is a multi-sig wallet. They store 1 key for you, you store a secure back up key, and an every day spending key. So now when I want to send Bitcoin using Bitgo I use my key to sign a transaction but I also require the collaboration of Bitgo to send as they use their key also. This means if my computer was malware ridden and my key are compromised BitGo can still control spending limits with their secured key. This makes it more bank like and allows me to not be in full control (normally) so that it's not my full responsiblity to keep Bitcoin safe. But (unlike Coinbase, Circle, Coinkite) it also means that BitGo never stored my money, they don't really hold it if they want to send it somewhere they need my collaboration as 2 of the 3 keys must be used together.  The 3rd key is something I would hold in cold storage so that if BitGo disappeared I still have my Bitcoin as I can go behind their back and use my two keys together to sign a Bitcoin transaction.
Green Address It has a 2 of 2 multi-sig wallet. This means we both need to collaborate to send Bitcoin. They have implemented instant confirmations into this. For example if I send Bitcoin to a merchant he will need to wait for a confirmation to guarantee no double spending. With GreenAddress.It they are trusted not to double spend. So I can send from there and the merchant is okay. But I don't want to trust them with my Bitcoin, so you use multi-sig and now me and them must collaborate on every transaction. Now there is instant confirmation and they can't steel my money and pull a Gox.  
An other useful thing of a 2 of 3 multisig implementation is escrow. Bitcoin it isn't reversible, there are no charge backs. This is problematic because if I buy something off eBay  and it doesn't show with a credit card I call up the bank and say reverse the transaction. With Bitcoin the money would be gone. So what you do is use an escrow system. Essentially you give your Bitcoin for the purchases to eBay (if they accepted Bitcoin) and when you buy something eBay locks both you and the seller out of the Bitcoin, now only they control it. This way the seller can't run with your money. The seller then send me the product when I receive it I tell eBay to give him the money and I get good buyer's feedback for doing so. Now if the seller didn't send the product I dispute it with eBay if they side with me I get the money back. If I didn't release the funds then the seller complains to eBay and eBay send the money to him. So it prevents fraud with an irreversible transaction. But this causes a problem. I need to trust eBay with my Bitcoin. What if I can't trust them or a similar site? With P2SH I can set up a 2 of 3 multisig wallet. Now the seller holds 1 key, the buyer holds an other, and eBay the 3rd. Remember, 2 of those 3 keys must be used together. So now I send my money to this wallet. When the seller gives me the product me and him work together to sign the transaction and send it to his own personal wallet. If there is a despite I take it up with eBay and eBay sides with me now me and eBay sign the transaction together and send the Bitcoin back to me. Now neither the seller, the buyer, or escrow provider controlled the funds. It becomes entirely decentralized escrow.   
You can have different set ups like a 4 of 6 multi-sig if you wanted where say 6 bankers hold a key and they each live in different countries. Now 4 must collaborate together to spend the Bitcoin. So you can't just kidnap 1 and get the money. You need to kidnap 4 of them. If something happened where 2 died it would be okay because the other 4 have a key. 
**TL;DR:** P2SH is multi-sig (multiple signatures). It allows for things like decentralized escrow and wallet providers with extra security.

So some people are giving you bad explanations. 2FA aka 2 factor authentication is something used by sites to keep your account secure it is not just a bitcoin thing. Facebook and Gmail and outlook support it. 
The way it works is you put in your password then take out your phone and type in a second a one time code that lasts 20 seconds that your phone calculates. This code is time based. So basically you scan a qr code on your phone to set it up into a authenticator app. This gives it a code unique to your account. An algorithm is then used to take the current time in conjunction with that unique code to create a one time pin of 6 digits.
When you log into the site you need your password and then this pin which the website calculates based on the unique identifier to your account and the servers time. 
In essence someone needs not just your password but also your phone. Or at least the code stored in your phone that makes up 2FA. Your phone also does not need an Internet connection, just the right time. 
Hope that helped.

If you take a wallet.dat file for example and it has a password to encrypt it that doesn't encrypt the public keys or obscure what it is it only encrypts the private keys. This is why you can open up your wallet and see what the balance is because the public keys aren't encrypted. So while someone can't spend your bitcoins if they have that file they can tell it is a Bitcoin wallet and how much it is worth. If they see it is worth 10 BTC they could throw some computing power at that wallet in hopes of cracking the password. 
Now if you double encrypt it you are taking that wallet and encrypting it so that now the Dropbox IT staff can't go and discover it is a Bitcoin wallet. So double encrypted hides the amount of Bitcoin and that it is even bitcoin which you have backed up. Double that with 2 different passwords for each layer of encryption and your back up is safe.

If I run a set of severs in a central office they can all talk to each other in a snap. If you run a decentralized network and need to wait something like 600 milliseconds for your transaction to be heard on the other end of the planet and relayed across the network. In order for the network to he decentralized you are required to have peers all over. You have no choice but to have to wait for propagation time. It's always going to be slower. This isn't a problem at all for money transfer. It is however for real time trades. 
I notice people on here seem to think that "oh you can use the blockchain no need for stock exchanges"  all the while they are all off trading their Bitcoins on off-chain centralized trade engines run by Bitstamp, Bitfinex, BTC-e, etc. The blockchain is about ownership/property rights. Not not about trading in real time with not previously established entities permitting a trade to happen instantly the moment two limit orders of unknown individuals  match.

Banks have some pretty mediocre security measures. It is significantly harder to get into my Vault of Satoshi account than my bank account. 
Why? Because VOS asks for a strong password, then it asks security questions and has 2FA. I can use Google Authenticator for 2FA or I have the option to send me a code by email, this code is encrypted with my PGP key so an attacker who needs my 2FA to get into my email also needs my laptop or backup of the PGP key. 
My bank enforced a week password. BMO enforces that the password can not be longer than 6 characters and that it is not case sensitive. My Tangerine account enforces that it must be a 6 digit PIN. Then it asks security questions. Neither bank even blocks foreign VPNs. Then all Canadian Banks default to RC4 encryption, I need to make it so Chrome resorts it's encryption preferences so that I can use AES encryption. 
Banks are over confident in their ability to reverse transactions and to take on the costs of fraud themselves if they feel it increases ease of use. Bitcoin you can't do that and companies are forced to have actual security measures.

Okay, arbitrage.
 If it's not possible then there cannot be any accurate correlation between the price of GBTC and Bitcoin it's self. If at the very least high networth individuals can preform arbitrage (like in the case of GLD with actual gold) then this keeps the price tied to the actual asset. 
So is there any way for people to pull off arbitrage because if not this doesn't effect the actual  Bitcoin market.

That the majority of people don't like being in full control of their money and feel it is safer in a bank. Specifically the older people who like  walking into the branch talking to a teller and have a financial adviser all the while with federally issued deposits. 
It is hard to buy bitcoin with all those verification of accounts needed. 
It's also slow to transfer your dollars to an exchange (though Vault of Satoshi may be changing this in Canada) 
People face problems from malware. As much as I like being my own bank I take the responsibility of securing my money, most people aren't ready for that. 
Few places also accept bitcoin. People in the west think the banking system as it is is working just fine for them and although it has its flaws it's not as volatile as bitcoin. Make a service where you can buy bitcoin immediately for  very low fee and then buy your goods with it immediately to prevent volatility and do so seamlessly as PayPal.

It sounds like the problem is mostly in CoinJoins trustless mixing and that using centralized mixers can do off-chain transactions so they would be safer. 
If you really wanted to hide your self it has always been considered a good idea to use several mixers in combination with even exchanges as well (eg. BTC &gt; LTC on BTC-e and trade LTC &gt; BTC on cryptsy) This means higher fees than CoinJoin's network fee only.

**1**, how would you apply the principles of a credit union to bitcoin. 
**2** don't just think oh well there are only a few credit unions around. It's 2014 and we have the Internet. When ING set up shop here in 1997 the changed banking for ever. 
**Direct banks became serious completion.** scarcity is then no longer a the problem. The definition of a direct bank is basically a bank that has no branches or very few but can offer service to the entire country by the Internet or Phone. You Then a use ABM network like [The Exchange Network]( to offer zero fee ABM access. 
You can get [zero fee chequeing accounts](  with direct banks and [ savings accounts that are actually above the rate of inflation]( unlike with big banks that offer interest far below inflation rate. 
ING probably stands out best for chequeing as they are the first direct bank. Since last year they did get sold to Scotia Bank though but their motto is so different than big banks that I still signed up. And despite being owned by Scotia they are still operating as a separate company. All online banking or **24/7 customer support** over the phone. Because really. What's better than talking about low rate mortgage while drunk in your underwear at 3 Am? 
While other direct banks are better for savings accounts ING still beats out the big banks. They are probably best with chequeing  though. It's **0 fees** even for ordering cheques you also get interest on chequeing accounts. You get around  not having a branch problem by 1 depositing  cheques via mobile banking app with camera. And 2 using other banks ABM networks. 
**I only mention this for 2 reasons.** One this is far more inline with sometime suited to the bitcoin crowd and they offer such a radical different experience that I'm sure bitcoiners would like. 
In addition to zero fees you get [**$100 just for for signing up**]( and **$25** for every time you refer a friend they also get $25. They don't have  branches but instead do have  cafés in Montreal, Toronto, and Vancouver (I think)  so you can bank and get a coffee for your adviser. 
Other notable direct banks are [Canadian Direct Financial]( (*2.25% on TFSA also good for other services*)  and [Peoples trust]( (*3% TFSA, but that's all they are good for other than secure cards*) 
So why give the big banks your money and complain about not being able to find a small bank that's good for your. You'll find the best banks in the Internet. We think there's no competition. We have completion you just need to find it.

In the menu for electrum you go to the file menu (or something similar) and there is a thing that says backup wallet. 
Essentially what that wallet file is is more or less the same thing as your seed, though I think it also contains transaction history. Essentially if that file was deleted or corrupt electrum would no longer be able to access those Bitcoin unless you have a back up (this can be back up of the file or your seed). 
Really if you have those 12 words written down from the set up process those 12 words (in that specific chronological order) are your Bitcoins. But alternatively as an additional backup you have a wallet file that Electrum saves and encrypts with  a password of your choosing. If you  backup this file it can also be used to restore your Bitcoin. It can be a good idea to store this on a USB stick. This is the file on your computer that is your Bitcoin wallet. Also while you need the password that encrypts that file to spend the Bitcoin anyone with that file can view the balance of your wallet. 
The more backups the better. Wouldn't want to lose your computer (or hard drive dies) and then also lose your back up.

Then from BMO to exchange via Interac Online. CaVritex charges flat rate fee of $1.50 for this, Vault of Satoshi $2.50. Depending on the exchange this deposit takes anywhere from instant to 1 hour.

I like Bitfinex and OKCoin (international USD version). 
They both offer margin trading for spot. OKCoin also has futures with up to 20x leverage on them. They both have  various order types such as OCO, stops, trailing stops.  
OKCoin allows for more advance order types. Makes it so you can comfortably care for your open positions while you sleep. OKCoin actually has more order types than Bitfinex. For example OKCoin let's you set stop limits, Bitfinex only allows stop markets. OKCoin doesn't serve Americans though by the way. 
Bitfinex though is nicer trading platform and it's  TradeView integration is great. 
You want to trade where there's high volume though. For USD Bitfinex is pretty much most liquid market. Bitstamp is up there too. Bitfinex doesn't require verification just  for trading (needs it to withdraw/deposit fiat but not to trade against USD, many exchanges need verification even for trading). 
Those are my recommendations but I suggest buying your Bitcoin and selling them for fiat elsewhere just buy where it's most convenient then transfer those Bitcoin to the exchange you use to trade. Then when you need to withdraw withdraw in Bitcoin. This way you won't have to deal with wire transfers. 
Kraken is popular for Euro trading too. Just remember  go where  the volume is at.

This is the evolution of torrents first Napster, eMule, BitTorrent, Bitcoin.
Torrents let you store files over a P2P network of seeders and other participating  peers. This means if a file is demanded it cant be censored,. The reason why you can download any movie though a Torrent very easily is because it's decenterlalized. 
This however requires people to be in demand of your content for it to exist independent of you. That kills undemanding files form existing in the cloud. This can include your personal encrypted  info. 
With the Blockchain this is fixed. Indiscriminate decentralization of files.

So clearly you're in the US with a joke of a 0.1% interest on a savings account. This is a joke and my checking account pays higher interest. Don't worry, you can get something half decent. I'm here to help.
Your a Bitcoiner. You like internet money, right? Why not deal with [Direct Banks]( because they service you everywhere. They don't charge you fees. They are on the internet and no joke. Literally very direct bank in America pays higher interest on their checking account than the big banks do on their savings accounts. 
For those in the US [Synchrony bank]( and [CIT bank]( both pay 0.95% interest. If you only trust a brand name [Barclay's  US division pays 0.9%](  
[Bank of Internet Rewards Checking]( pays up to 1.25% interest and they let you use every ATM in the country for free because they refund all service fees plus it's an entirely free account with no minimum balances or monthly fees. [Everbank]( also lets you use all ATMs for free if you have minimum balance of $5k, but again they have no fees they just don't refund ATM fees if you don't have $5k. Those two are domestic if you are looking for international ATM refunds Charles Shwab does this.
Everytime you give your dollar to a bank that rips you off you empower them. Don't do that, don't support them. Your foced to use banks, so  go empower the people who  treat you right. Then, just maybe, big banks will need to compete. 
The above are all FDIC insured as well. Check out [BankRate.com]( as well, fucking great site (they had some pages down for maintenance at time of writing)

It's the blickchain. Long term we need decentralized  dynamically increasing block sizes.  Bitcoin solves the centralization issue so we can implement decentralized rules to adapt max block size as needed. 
20 MB is a good temporary fix but I'm not aware of anyone suggesting each time an increase is needed devs must implement it. Either it should be presently increased to large enough amount or set so that in X and Y block it changes to size A and B, or the network calculated after ever so many blocks what the size should be (much like how difficulty is determined). It's necessary to do this as Bitcoins adoption increases the network can become greater decentralized as others run older Bitcoin nodes or even customized Bitcoin nodes. Then implementing new hard for features won't be possible due to fragmentation of node operators.,

You shouldn't store your money in a big bank regardless. Big banks are the worst place to store money to start with. Use direct banks and feel what it's like to have competition and not get screwed. You don't need to live by a bank to be its customer. 
For example in the US Bank of America only pays 0.03% interest, other big US banks will not pay more than 0.1% (Chase, Wells Fargo). But anywhere in America you can get 0.95% from Synchrony Bank. Every [direct bank] (     )  in the US pays higher interest on their fucking checking  account than the big banks pay on their crap ass savings account. [more banks] ( 
In Canada the big 6 banks all only pay 1% interest on both TFSA and non-registered account. Big you can get 3% on TFSA from People's Trust and 1.9% on non-registered account from Implicity Financial. [More banks](  
That and stop paying back fees. Direct banks offer free unlimited transaction checking accounts. Bank of Internet USA for example is both free and refunds all ATM service fees of any domestic ATM. Why do so few in know about direct banks. We all love Internet money, right?

QuadrigaCX is 0.5% fee only and accepts instant deposits like Vault of Satoshi via Interac. So that's instant and cheaper than credit card with Circle.

True that and I can't argue against that logic. But ask your self this. What would the statistics for recruitment need to be?


So. Even the conservative figures are saying that 18% of deaths are of innocents. This would mean that it would require 6 people to be recruited for *each* of those *innocent* deaths for it to undoubtedly be considered counter productive. Now that's excluding the other 82% that could still act as cause for revenge. Now, even if the likely hood is small. Is it too unreasonable to suspect that 6 people might get mad enough by the death of an innocent to join a terrorist organisation looking to recruit whose whereabouts is in their area?

I agree that they aren't communist nor socialist. They aren't really the *People's Republic* of China, they are  only in name not in reality. 
The people of China do not own the means of production nor consumption. Rather an authoritarian dictatorship and the military that backs it controls the power, the economy, and are a class above the public. They dob't actually eliminate class struggle, they create class struggle between the general population and the aristocrats running the place with an iron fist. 
They are however [Marxist-Leninist]( The whole vanguard party (single party state), centrally planned economies, state ownership (what some would call state capitalism) is very much so Marxist-Leninist. Though I wouldn't say that the Chinese aren't Marxist-Leninist, rather that Marxist-Leninism is not communism.

Think Costs. To arbitrage between CaVirtex and VOS CaVirtex charges $5 to deposit by an EFT this takes up to 5 business days. Then VOS charges I think $8 for withdrawal via EFT. So this means total 10 days. Could cut buying time down to 2-3 Days will bill payment on CaVirtex but that costs $20.
So I could go buy 1 BTC on CaVirtex with a 5$ fee then once deposit is received buy and immediately sell on VOS then withdraw for $8. So that is 10 days and $13 in fees plus the trading fee charged by each exchange. Starting at 1% on VOS (though currently free) and starting at 1.5% on CaVirtex. The price gap as you where saying was $25. 
So you could do the arbitrage and some people have but that means it is very slow and you need at least a few thousand dollars to minimize the impact those EFT fees and the EFTs are slow so you are making more money than holding your funds in a savings account but it's a hassle. Unless the exchanges enable instant withdrawal over email money transfer (which CaVirtex used to do but not sure why they stopped) then it is effort and time to do the arbitrage. The time being a huge factor as it limits you to 2 sales per month. So you need a couple grand to do it unless you feel it's worth the trouble to make that extra $100 or so per month.

Yeah I wished those vaccines would do something but I doubt it. There have been various things in the past some of which have even gotten media attention like this one. Just look up DCA or CBD both things which kill cancer and look very promising. CBD has it's trouble with research as it is a marijuana compound though many people have claimed it cured their cancer and it sure has in mice and in the labs. Some actively consume highly potent hemp oil illegally in hopes to cure their cancer and they might just be given what research has been done on the substance.
Then there is DCA which can not be patented as it is in the public domain. When it was discovered even the mainstream media was admitting that this cure wouldn't go anywhere because it couldn't get the funding from big pharma due to it's inability to be patented and then turn a profit. When I mean big media I'm not joking. CTV said it during their national news broadcast. To the last of my knowledge they halted research on it despite all tests looking increasingly promising. The reason as you may have guessed, they couldn't fund the research. 
With the case of this vaccine it is a virus, it is life and in many countries you can't patent life. Mind you in America you can patent genetics which is just screwed up on it's own though maybe that means this virus can hold promise. It also might not be to far fetched to say there is little monetary incentive to cure cancer when it is so much more profitable to just treat it slowly.  Makes me feel uneasy though how the movie I Am Legend started off with a virus that kills cancer.
By the way cancer kills in one of two way at least from my understanding. It grows tumours as you know. This tumour can kill by eating up all the nutrition that your body is given, this starves your body from what it needs to survive. This tumour could also potentially be placed in an area where it steels nutrients from certain organs and what not such as colon cancer where your body can no longer feed it's self as it is now feeding a tumour. Seen how it is just a tumour that exists this is why you see many images of people with large tumours who are very much alive as they have been able to essentially feed the tumour and it exists in a place which isn't so threatening. The second way cancer kills is simply by taking up space. For example if you have a brain tumour and the tumour keeps growing there is only so much room in your skull. This tumour then competes with space with your brain squishing it and inevitably killing the patient. I suppose this is also what happens with lung cancer where if a tumour kept growing in your lungs you couldn't breath, it would be like drowning out of water.

If it drops though then you get to average down and buy more. This way you position yourself in such a way you get to take advantage of either situation (up or down) and mitigate risk. Always work your way into a position slowly over time.

Clearly any transaction above $10k is reported to the government with information that identifies the individual who made the transfer. Why? Because it's the law and that's what FinCen does. I don't see any reason for them to report every little transaction that is a tedious process. But if the government comes in wanting those transactions they can get it, and depending on the value of that transaction Coinbase as a legal obligation to store the info should government request it even if it's something not innately reported. 
Now a better question is. Does Coinbase only comply where they have a legal obligation to do so. If a cop walks in wanting info about a user and threatening them. Does Coinbase say "get a get a warrant or fuck off", are they willing to go to court to stand up for that principle? Or do they just cave in? Do they just let the NSA go in dry without resistance in a court of law?

As far as I am concerned yes, Bitcoin is at a low price now and people will regret in the future they didn't buy now. Regardless Bitcoin is still a highly volatile investment.
 Most would consider it a very high risk investment, and that it is, but my self and much of the rest of this sub won't see it as one of those crash and burn investments. Bitcoin prices might go down, but if you HODL they will recover eventually. At least that's the bet I am willing to take. Most high risk investments are more along the lines of crash and burn if they fail, high return but the money is gone for life if it suffers low return. 
My self my first investment was Bitcoin as well, but generally your first investments should be more conservative lower risk, like a well balanced ETF portfolio which diversifies your investments over thousands of large cap stocks, sure it's far lower return than Bitcoin but no where near as voletile. So you choose. But if it's money you rely on Bitcoin isn't the place to invest it. If it's money you are okay possibly loosing, then Bitcoin might see you some very high returns well worth the risk.
And learn how to secure your Bitcoin, hold them yourself don't trust a 3rd party, learn to do it securely.

Wrong. Interac E-transfers are extremely fraud prone and chargeback prone which is what lead to the enviable decline of LibertyBit the once pleasurable exchange to use. Interac e-transfers are support by nearly all banks and credit unions. 
Interac Online however is what exchanges favour. This is promoted as no risk of charge backs but guys like QuickBt say that's limited coverage against charge backs. With enough documentation on your and verification exchanges reduce this risk making it not problematic to accept and thus why all 3 exchanges in Canada support it. Interac Online however isn't wide spread only the 4 largest banks support it and 2 other credit unions as well. Even then accounts linked to a visa debit don't work with Interac Online due to some stupid law. So this cuts off pretty much all TD customers.

This is why I don't use it. On Android you can make a backup but you need to be rooted and any other rooted apps may be able to get your 2FA keys. 
I use Authy. It has built in back up feature where they store it in the cloud but your password encrypts it, so as long as your password is good they can't see it. They also have a well set up process for restoring your codes to verify who you are. You are required to have access to your email though, so make sure you get access there. 
Regardless I recommend you still write down backup codes just in case. 
Edit: I think that for iPhone when you make backups in iTunes it will store the all data, so if you loose iPhone and you get a new iPhone you get your codes back.

Yeah but we're talking about two different things here. A node uses more bandwidth than it does storage space.

You answered your own question there. They need to be executed in their  proper order. Now if say there is say 1000 orders being filled in a second and your system can only handle 200 per second then how can you assure the right orders are matched? You might pair orders with someone who you shouldn't have  and then that effects your trade price. If you ca not accommodate enough fast enough then that means putting other orders in a queue. Now that means prioritizing certain order over others and giving certain orders preferential treatment so it is no longer effective.

I don't envision a world of crypto only. I envision it as a parallel system. Just that people will still want physical cash will help keep fiat alive. As will mortgages and likely credit cards. No doubt though bitcoins will find their place. Mostly in the internet and for money transfers especially of the international type. 
But loans can still be pulled off with bitcoin. With a bank now they give out your money to others as loans. Now if everyone wants their money out the bank defaults. This is probably less of a problem for banks now as we trade around lots of digital dollars and euros which is basically just trading the IOUs the bank originally gave to you. Though with fiat if bank fails central bank can just print the money to bail them out. With bitcoin that part couldn't happen. 
With bitcoin though I could see there being term deposits. Basically you give them bitcoin and they promise interest, this becomes your incentive to stores them with this bank. But being a term deposit you have agreed you won't have access to it for a set period of time. They can then lend out these bitcoins with interest as well as those of other depositors and give you some of that interest in return. Also loans could just be issued from revenue brought in from interest which would indeed create a much more stable system, though it would take time to accumulate that income so don't expect it any time soon. 
Regardless I think bitcoin as a co-currency is the future. This parallel system also offers me a safe Haven and a great place to save money and easily spend it when needed. It opens up huge opportunities for third world countries countries and places with week banking system. It works out to be great for international trade and see business owners. It provides you with a safe place to store money independently of a financial institution and for no one to be able to control the money you own. You wouldn't keep 20 grand cash at your house because you don't like the banking system. But you would keep 20 BTC in cold storage. 
@_date: 2017-02-08 03:45:07
It's probably fair to say it has an effect. Not a huge one, the main reason Bitcoin is going up mostly because Bitcoin is going up. Financial news networks always like to find a fundamental reason as a catalyst for a price hike when in reality the price hike has more to do with momentum and  psychology. 
But the value of the Yuan can sure play a role here. For example the CNY is decreasing in value now relative to USD. This drives more Chinese to look for an alternative means of storing wealth as the value of their national currency diminishes. So some buy Bitcoin. This creates a trend of Bitcoin price increasing relative to CNY despite how BTC/USD might remain roughly flat at the time. Subsequently the Chinese notice the BTC/CNY trend and buy into it. This causes the Chinese market to get ahead of the global market and then the global market catches up either taking advantage of arbitrage opportunities or just by acknowledging they are lagging behind China. Then the world continues to buy up the price wanting to catch the trend. 
So although the value of the Yuan and it's popularity may have little to do with the Bitcoin price increase. It could be one of the many catalysts that start to get the price moving up.

@_date: 2014-03-05 02:28:01
No I haven't. Other than online. But from my understanding they just calculate the dollar total and then they accept it with bitpay so it's never held in bitcoin. 
If you wanted to take all bitcoin to still pay tax I think with bitpay you can choose the percentage you want to convert. So you convert tax to CAD immediately. Deposit that then hold the rest in bitcoins. This would probably be used as you can't pay sales tax in bitcoin but to accept all bitcoin means selling some for taxes and then you may be needing to pay capital gains on your sales tax or loose profit from price dip.

Interac Online and Interac email money transfers are two different things. Interac online is only available to account holders at BMO, Scotia, RBC, and to a lesser extent TD. Email money transfers are available at all banks. The specific reason for accepting Interac online when it has less accessibility is that it is a system designed in a way that there won't be fraud like with an email transfer. Perhaps this is why the CRA uses it as a way to pay taxes.
Vault of Satoshi only requires level two verification for an Interac deposit. Level two is only a photo ID and proof of residency. Interac is the only fiat funding option available for level 2. All others require level 3+

This depends on arbitrage opportunities but OP is taking about using bitcoin for out of Europe transfers of funds. This means doing wire transfers probably into USD if not other currency. As there will be an bid/ask spread on USD/GBP, EUR to GBP and so on this means a hidden fee as you never get the official exchange rate. 
If you use bitcoin you can cut out this fee or minimize it or some times make a profit off arbitrage. This is something we would see in relation to Fiat to BTC to Fiat scenarios. This means it can be faster or cheaper than wire transfer in some cases but not always and not always faster if say the receiving party must do a slow domestic transfer to an exchange. For example if a wire takes 5 days UK bank transfers are fast so you can do GBP to exchange to bitcoin and send the bitcoin but if someone trading for USD needs to do a slow 5 day ACH it takes just as long. If transferring between countries with fast domestic transfers then bitcoin is faster. Like how you can do instant deposit to VOS 24/7 in Canada then send those bitcoins to UK where they have fast 24/7 bank transfer then it is faster and likely cheaper than a wire  (this scenario doesn't work the other way around as withdrawal of Canada would need an EFT which is just as slow as an ACH) 
It seems OPs vision is more within the realm of not being dependant on the exchange for Fiat at all.

With Apple being limited to their own devices it gets better optimization for that device. So yes it can run smoother this doesn't always mean it's faster though just that benchmarks can run better. Try zipping a file and comparing the speeds . Oh wait can't do that on iOS. 
Malware can be a problem on Android but most of that comes from unapproved sources not the play store. Google has taken it upon them selves to fix up the Malware issue in the play store (which was small) I've been on porn sites several times that download a .apk I'm not stupid enough to install it and if you where to do So you would need to enable the ability in settings. Sadly some people might fall for this or when using pirated apps. Antivirus software for Android is out there. Most of the reason why this happens with Android is because the operating system is far more powerful than iOS but malicious apps can take advantage of this. It is a trade off of security vs functionality.

Yeah from my understanding the bank does cover it usually. This may not always happen, this is why guys like QuickBT claim fraud and so this is why strick verification must be required to use it for large amounts in order to convince the bank to maintain liability. Adam also mentioned to me that it would involve a court case to reverse the transaction. So this differs for a credit card where the credit card company just decides. 
I think the key difference here is with Interac online I must be a registered merchant. With e-transfers anyone can receive it so to ensure it would mean greater financial loss to  as one could send money to anyone. Adam didn't want to elaborate on how but it seems VOS has a way of verifying that the bank account used with Interac is under the same name as the account holder at VOS, they have measures put in place to prevent fraud should any claim be made. 
The Max amount per transaction with Interac online is $2500. This means you can do several deposits to deposit more but bank may impose limits stopping this and lessening their liability in doing so.

Gravin plans to hard fork, it's necessary. The core devs are still discussing how to go about solving the transaction problem. You can't just go do it over night. We're talking about a $4 billion blockchain here. You got to get it right before release. There is also a lot of uncertainty about how to fix the problem. You can't have an unlimited block size, there must be a limit but you don't want to have to keep changing it. If Bitcoin becomes decentralized enough it can't be changed so you got to get it right in the early days. We need a dynamically adapting max block size. The issue is how do you make it adapt dynamically. What factors may be taking into consideration to expand/contract the max block size and still not have it be susceptible to spam transactions fooling the calculations. 
@_date: 2014-02-11 01:03:56
Not quite. They can send bitcoins to someone and then send those same coins to an other person. Then one of them isn't confirmed the other is. the balance on the blockchain is when its a confirmed transaction. What many people don't realize is that double spending isn't something that needs computing power. Computing power is required to change the contents of the blockchain but with 0 computing power one can send coins that are then invalid. this is why most websites require confirmation to make sure it is legit and registered on the blockchain.
From my understanding mtgox problem is similar to this. send coins to one person then to an other but those same coins, that same signed transaction but 1 will get accepted all others will get rejected

I've said this before and I will say it again. It doesn't matter that pools may only be able to do some things with 51%. What matters is that bitcoin is supposed to be decentralized. We should have as many pools as possible. It doesn't matter if it is P2Pool or centralized pools. What matters is that no pool maintains a large hashrate in order to be truly decentralized. I don't know what the distribution of that should like. No greater than 20%, 10, 5? I don't know but anything better than 42%, 15, 9, 6, 3, 2.

You don't need Windows to do this. You can run the daemon (bitcoind) regardless of the OS. If you're on Linux then it actually works out to be even better as you can turn the daemon into a system service with a simple initialization script (upstart or systemd) so that it will automatically start on boot up and automatically respawn if the process crashes. 
Also I'm not sure if this applies on Windows also but on Linux of you run bitcoind with the option             -daemon then you can close the terminal and bitcoind will continue to run in the background.

You'd need several thousand orders to be able to be executed within a second to actually serve the function of a true exchange that really serves as a price setter. You need to be able to accommodate flash crashes, panic buys, and make sure that all executed orders are final and don't need time to be verified by a decentralized network. 
That and Bitcoin is only going to grow. If you look at leading exchange outside of the Bitcoin world you see the extremes. The fallowing are the specs for the NASDAQ.

Wow, 72 hours. That must of been a really low fee you sent. I'm shocked it hasn't been rejected yet if it's taking that long.

@_date: 2017-02-03 22:52:57
We pay fees currently for transactions. That won't change. We'll continue to. 
There's a block size limit. So only so many transactions can fit in a block. The higher fee and more days destroyed the higher priority a transaction has. So the market demands higher and higher fees (to some extent) as Bitcoin becomes more popular. More transactions in the future will occur. The result is that by the time Bitcoin's block reward equals zero (some time around the year 2140 or so) there'd be so many transactions going on that miners will be able to collect fees from them. If the fees aren't enough to pay the miners then more miners will power off which brings down the hash rate and then lowers the difficulty resulting in greater profitability for those that continue to mine. Market forces take effect and miners make money.

I'm not talking about public in that all can see though. That's not what I mean. 
I understand the term "public"  as in government in reference to the people owning the government by which the people own something, like a public utility owned by the citizens that use it through the means of the government they elect and pay for. 
I'm saying that "public"  does not exclusively mean government. Public means something that's owned by the public. Bitcoin being a decentralized peer to peer consensus network that anyone can join and participate in and no one controls creates a system by which it is not private because no business, no corporation owns it. 
The rules of the network are enforced by anyone that wants to run a node. Anyone can. The rules that say that 12.5 BTC are mined per block every 10 minutes and halving every 4 years with a 1 MB maximum block size. This is something that is open to the public for anyone to play a role in. 
I'm saying it's not private because there is no central entity that can own it. There's plenty private entities that play a role in the network but they do not own the network. 
If your hell bent  on the idea that for something to be public means it's government then let's look at it this way. Bitcoin is neither private nor public, it is something autonomous on its own that doesn't fit within the traditional views of public nor private ownership. By virtual of Bitcoin's decentralisation it removes the ability for anyone to control the network, there for it can't be  a privately owned.

An other reason truly decentralized exchanges can't be made is latency. If you are decentralized then you need nodes spread out around the world run by various people. Now when you factor in all the latency involved in this and time taken to verify the legitimacy of a trade you can't get high preforming trade engine. You need a trade engine that can execute thousand so orders per second without error and remain consistent. This won't happen with a block chain based trade engine. 
I don't know why we always see comments on decentralized exchanges. Sure you can have things like Local Bitcoin and variants of that model or bitshares and what not but those aren't comparable to the full functions of an exchange. You can't have a decentralized exchange and fiat is only part of the issue. Even a crypto to crypto decentralized exchange has issues.

Miners aren't s throat to Bitcoin, yes miners with too much power is a threat to Bitcoin. Pools must be small enough for adequate decentralisation. Unfortunately people only seem to panic when s pool actually gets close to 51% and not the signs leading up to it. 
You can't get rid of the miners. That would mean ditching Proof of Work on favor for what? Proof of Stake? That would just centralize all the control into the hands of early adopters and the rich. That'd be far more damaging to decentralisation than miners ever could be. 
If you feel the threat of a 51% attack is imminent my suggestion play your role up keep bitcoin decentralized. Go buy an ASIC and start mining on a small pool. Vote with your hash rate and you as a participant in the market will aid in decentralisation of the network.

If blocks are too big then the blockchain becomes hard to redistribute through P2P nodes. Think at 1 MB block that's 56 GB a year. A 20 MB block would be 1 TB a year.
So while bigger blocks are needed we can't be dependant on bigger blocks to address Bitcoin's long term scalability issues because eventually a block size increase isn't a solution but rather a problem. So LN allows for fast low free day to day transactions while not requiring large blocks and therefore making it easier to run full nodes.

Only if they are permitted by law even then it doesn't mean they can't default. Being 100% digital doesn't mean 100% bank credit. Central bank base money is still digital also. When a bank has money on reserve this isn't all cash. No, instead most of the bank's reserve is of other digital money. From that digital money they lend out more of it than they actually have and this become bank credit. So even if money is 100% digital they still need something on reserve in order to produce bank credit and they still can default as to a certain degree they do have a liability to the initial depositor.

Well America got shit interest rates. Observing from Canada I feel sad for the people who think they should save money with Chase or BOA when my savings accounts are between 10-30x the interest rate. But the thing is even in America you can get checking accounts that pay higher interest rates than that 0.1% on savings accounts at big banks. 
The below are some of the most notable direct banks in America. 
[Ally:](    0.87% interest on savings
[CapitalOne360:](  0.75%
[Connexus Credit Union:]( up to 2%
They are all [direct banks.]( If you trust the Internet with your bitcoins. It's also a better place to park your USD. They also offer free checking accounts with little to no fees (look at how cheap CapitalOne overdraft fees are. It's ridiculously cheap)

Your other comment said you open your account there just to do business with them only for Bitcoin. Why would you do that? Why open a secondary account from a scummy bank that will charge you fees?
You can get a **no fee checking account from Ally, CapitalOne360, Everbank, Charles Shwab, Bank of Internet, Connexus Credit Union**, First Trade Union Bank, Mutual of Omaha bank, Nationwide Bank and quite probably a few more anywhere in the country that doesn't charge you any fees and even pays you higher interest on their checking account than those scum fucks known as Wells Fargo do on their savings account. My first choices would be the ones in bold.
Don't limit your self to the banks down the street. Use [direct banks]( they won't charge you a dime for having a secondary account for doing what you are doing and Ally will even let you receive wire transfers for free. They are online only banks so they service you nationwide doesn't matter where you are. Some even offer 24/7 customer support. That and yeah you can always use a credit union if you want.

Blockchain technology isn't about "oh I have trust in the biggest pools so I don't care if they control it". It's about a trustless decentralized system where we deprive the ability of any one entity from having control over the network. It's about "oh you're big and powerful and want control? tough luck."  
That's why the market panics when a pool get's too much hash rate. It turns a decentralized system into a near centralized system.

Nah. Double spend is a hack of sorts. 
See Bitcoin has nodes and it has miners. The reason why miners are needed is to confirm transactions. Nodes propagate transactions but they can't be trusted because someone could send Bitcoin to address A and then send those same Bitcoin to address B. This is called double spending. So this is why we require confirmations from miners to prevent this fraud and to ensure the funds have only been spent once and you can't resend the Bitcoin you already spent. 
So how does one double spend? Well for the most part to prevent fraud and make unconfirmed transactions more reliable miners should only respect the first transaction sent and not the duplicate (double spending) rejecting the second so as to not allow someone to be frauded. The thing is miners can be greedy, they're inclined to accept a transaction with a higher fee as it's more profitable. So although not for certain it is definitely possible that someone  could send those Bitcoin to address A with a low fee and then fool person A into thinking they got paid (because they didn't wait for a confirmation) and then send those same Bitcoin to themselves at address B for a higher fee. Then miners may accept the second transaction with a higher fee and B gets the Bitcoin and A doesn't. 
Now how does this hack benefit you? Well this hack could let you increase the fee, if you sent to address A with a low fee and it doesn't get confirmed you could potentially rebroadcast that transaction again to address A with a higher fee though and then that higher fee transaction gets confirmed and the original transaction is rejected. You'd need to use command line to do this as this isn't standard practice, and like I said essentially a hack. 
Has your transaction still not been confirmed. Did you check the original address? If it's been this long the transaction may have been rejected all together. What fee does  your transaction have? How may Satoshi's per byte?

Normally a Bitcoin exchange means you can deposit/withdraw Dollars and Bitcoin. That's what makes prices reflect reality.
Well China has really strict capital controls. They don't like people moving money out of the country or escaping the Yuan which they control. China is a Marxist-Leninist de fracto single party state. So as you can imagine they aren't very big on the whole free market thing.  
So the PBOC's (China's central bank) views just the mere act of withdrawing Bitcoin from an exchange as potential  money laundering because doing so allows the public to circumvent all their strict monetary policies. As such two major Chinese exchanges have stopped Bitcoin withdrawals for the next month so that they can make sure they are complicit in PBOC guidelines for money laundering rather than get shut down.

Bitcoin has the network effect and scarcity that alts don't. Altcoins can coexist with Bitcoin, because some may do things better doesn't mean that they make Bitcoin obsolete. 
That said if Bitcoin doesn't address the scalability issue we may very well start to see alts make it obsolete. However so long as Bitcoin innovates to addresses these issues then I'd expect it to stay the leader. People will merely use different alts if they are better suited for what they need. It's like how Euro's and Yen coexist, same can be said for Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Ether.

Dam. I hope you were smart about this though. Bitcoin has great long term prospects. But I wouldn't be shocked if it drops to $800 tomorrow. I also wouldn't be shocked if it jumped up to $2000 within the next two weeks to a month. Either could happen, both could happen. 
So just saying as a word advice you got to mitigate risk. If your plan was to buy $10,000 of Bitcoin the smart idea is say buy $5000 today and wait 2-4 weeks to see where the market goes up buy the other $5k spread out over that time span. This way you get the best of both sides. You get to take advantage of the opportunity of the price increasing as well as the opportunity of a price decline (buying opportunity).

Bitcoin rising to the moon is more about psychology in the market than it is fundamentals. It doesn't matter if an ETF being launched is done with Bitcoin already out if circulation or not. What matters is it's perceived increase in adoption and recognition. This will drive up prices. Additionally in influx of capital from investors who are only interested in Bitcoin if it's from an ETF listed on a major stock exchange will be willing to buy shares in said ETF. That demand drives up prices there which drives up prices on all Bitcoin markets as it fuels a bull run and as institutional investors pull off arbitrage.

Actually it doesn't. The model for Central banks (like the Fed, the BOC, BOJ, ECB) is that they aren't controlled by the government. The government is technically their parent company and take the profit of the central bank. However the government doesn't control inflation because they don't control the central bank. Instead it chooses it's own employees and makes its own decisions. The idea behind this is that if the government controlled the issuance of a currency they would just print a lot. So instead they fork it off to non elected officials that control inflation while letting the government say little to influence their actions.

Because the blockchain doesn't serve as a mission critical trade engine. The NASDAQ has a trade execution [time of 1 millisecond and has handled 35,000 trades per second with the ability to withstand 60,000 per second.]( Bitcoin can handle 3-7 transactions per second maximum. 
The blockchain has to do with transfer of ownership and asset/property management. It still takes time for transactions to propagate across the network as well. We are still reliant on centralized platforms in order to achieve highly reliable fast executing trades from hoards of traders at the same time. Why do you use an exchange like Bitstamp when  you have Bitcoin? You still need a place to trade those Bitcoin. 
Things like colour coin on the blockchain are useful for proof of ownership and the ability to hold the asset outside of a brokerage account and hold it independently. You still need a place to trade with people. For this you need an exchange like the NASDAQ. A centralized platform will always offer faster trade execution times than a decentralized platform giving propagation time needed across a decentralized platform. But we will see the blockchain permit you to trade with who you want on what exchange you want and hold independently.

Nope Bitcoin isn't private. No one owns it. No one controls the network. It is decentralized it is a public open source  network anyone can join and no one controls. 
No corporation owns it, no bank own it, no government owns it. Just because government doesn't control something doesn't mean it can't be publicly owned. 
Who owns the Bitcoin network? You and I. 
Edit: Miner's are a for profit private business yes. But the protocol isn't owned by anyone. The protocol is open and owned by us all and miners don't control the network so long as no one  has 51% of the hash rate.  Anyone can be a node. Visa owns Visa. Ant Pool does not own Bitcoin, we all do it's an open network run by the public that anyone can play a role in participating in and further decentralize it in the process. Bitcoin is literally a public ledger.

They won't be trading on a stock exchange. It's a Bitcoin exchange. Not an ETF. With a stock exchange you are trading a representation of Bitcoin. Much like how with GLD you aren't buying gold, you are buying a representation of it backed by reserves. Coinbase by no means is getting an ETF approved far faster than the Winkelvii. The NYSE is a business like any other. Their business just happens to be an exchange that trades stock. The NYSE investing  is no indication of Bitcoin listing as an ETF on the stock exchange. Coinbase is making an  exchange where you can actually buy Bitcoin and withdraw it. They are seeking to add liquidity.

Well an exchange means they hold dollars for extended periods of times and their users get to determine the price. The price is made from the supply and demand of their users. It has an order book. Currently Coinbase just holds USD only for as long as required to transfer in and out of Bitcoin. They don't let you place a limit order and they are sourcing coins for other exchanges where the market sets the price. By running their own exchange in addition to what they currently do it means it's easier for day traders in the US to trade and transfer to an exchange most probably by ACH instead of doing a wire transfer to Bitstamp. This also means it can cut cost for Coinbase as they can source their Bitcoin from their own domestic exchange instead of needing  to transfer fiat to a foreign exchange for Bitcoin that charges trading  fees.

Speculation based on the last bubble. From year start to year end of 2013 Bitcoin went up roughly 8800%. Over this same scale Litecoin went up 32,000%. Something significantly higher. I don't know what the future holds for Litecoin but it is still the second biggest crypto by market cap to Bitcoin and historically what we see is Bitcoin is  volatile as fuck and Litecoin is volatile as fucking shit x10. So there's reason to belive Litecoin will preform worst than Bitcoin when Bitcoin does bad but that when Bitcoin does good Litecoin will do even better than Bitcoin and that's just based on past events. People see Bitcoin go up high, the feel the missed the gravey train but that they can get in on Litecoin because it's a low price and then they'll get rich and that causes a bigger bubble in Litecoin than Bitcoin.

No obviously not. But if you buy something on overstock with bitcoin vs credit card then overstock saved. Now if overstock is able to take those bitcoins and not exchange to dollars then they saved all fees, they can then pay dell directly in those received  bitcoins where Dell can then convert to dollars with payment processor and their fees. Now Overstock doesn't need to do a slow processes of receiving credit card money in their bank account then doing an ACH to Dell. Instead they can do it for practically free to Dell and do it in a few min. 6 confirmations = one hour. vs a few business days.

I don't know how this particularly would work but from my understanding the way DDOS protection works is to have a robust network of severs that mirror the site. This speeds it up and also means that the network is strong enough to withstand DDOS due to being a large server farm.

This includes free access to the global ATM alliance you can can withdraw abroad sans service fees from partnered banks (Bank of American, Barclay's, etc) They also allow you to deposit cheques s by taking a photo of the. They have lenient holding policy. Also 24/7 customer support. If you sign up with at least $100 I can give you my referral code for them and they'll give you $25 for  signing up with it. Tangerine was the first direct bank in Canada (under the name ING Direct) and to this day are the largest serving 2 million customers across Canada. They are most innovate and make it really easy to use without branches. They have the best most full features mobile/online banking. There savings is 1.3% on all balances. Chequeing pays 0.25%.
For savings go elsewhere. People's Trust is highest on savings held in TFSA at 2.5%. For non-registered they 1.8% but you can get better for non registered elsewhere with about 1.9 - 2%. [savings account comparison](  People's Trust does have great 1 year GIC at 2.4% also.

And blocktime, Litecoin comes along changing the hash function from SHA-256 to Scrypt (which does have its benefits for scalability reasons) then miners start moving to that because of ASICs coming into play with Bitcoin. Then this is when the alt-coins come in HAM when a bunch of people start making Scrypt coins that anybody can mine. Then ASICs start heading to Litecoin and people go off and make other so called "ASIC resistant" coins like Vertcoin using different hash functions like x11 and so forth so that GPU miners don't let the hardware go to waist. AFAIK the only altcoin around that wasn't based on any of the Bitcoin code but was written completely from scratch is NXT Coin.

An exchange is where day traders are determining the price. It is where users can place a bid or an ask price for the Bitcoin they intend to buy/sell.  When a buyers bid price matches a sellers asking price a trade is executed. Supply and demand result in price fluctuations. It's like a stock market in that people trade and you can place limit order and market orders. With an exchange I can place an order to but Bitcoin at $200 even though the rate is $235. Then if the price drops to $200, if sellers are willing to pay that amount then I will get the Bitcoin at $200. If sellers won't accept that amount of money the trade will never happen. 
With Coinbase or Circle you get their rate that's it. You can't place a limit order and they source their coins from various exchanges. Their users don't determine the price of Bitcoin, their users aren't the market deciding much rather they base their rate off of that of other exchanges to get a valuation of the Bitcoin and then add on a service fee to this. Coinbase controls the price they sell Bitcoin for. Bitstamp doesn't (their users do).

Not necessarily. For example as a Canadian if I get a work Visa in the US even though I would then be living in the US I would pay my taxes to the Canadian government not the US government. This will happen with other countries as well. If I went to work in the Australia I would pay taxes to Canada and not to Australia (due to tax treaties) so long as I'm not a permanent residence of Australia.
From my understanding what the difference is is that if I become a permanent resident in the US I would then no longer pay taxes to Canada but the US only. If I became a permanent resident in Australia I would no longer pay taxes to Canada but Australia only. There is no double taxation and the US is one of the only two countries (the other which I never heard of until now) that says even if you are a permanent residence of an other country you are double taxed by both that country and the US. So the only way to not pay US taxes is to revoke your US citizenship.

This happened in Vancouver at the first Bitcoin ATM. Some guy was doing that so they hired a security guard to kick out people. Undercutting the ATM. 
I believe average mockup on Localbitcoins is 10%, so keep ATM under that and it's still competitive. Although some sellers will under cut that to go stay competitive and it would likely depend on your region and accessibly to cheap Bitcoin there.  My self I got ATM's in the area with roughly ~3% fee so that undercuts roughly of all Localbitcoins.

Having multiple keys on multiple different servers with different security implementations. For example if the hot wallet involves keys on one server now a hacker must hack that server. He must find exploits specific to it that circumvents the security measures taken by the hacker. No if instead of having for example say, one Linux server for the hot wallet you where to set up a 3 of 3 multi-sig wallet and you now have  1 key in a Linux server,  the second key on a Windows server, and the third on a BSD server. Now a hacker must find exploits that exist in all of those operating systems and their different security standards such as varying firewalls that are used.  Alternatively just having two different parties (BitGo control one server, Bitstamp and other) means that each party had their own best set of security practises that suites their needs. So a vulnerability might exist on one parties server but not an other.

If it's in a Web wallet then it's like your bank where the money is accessible everywhere so authentication is required. With Bitcoin if it's in your own stand alone wallet then your money only exists where the keys are. So cold storage I a vault restricts the location of those Bitcoin to that vault. A key on my phone as long as phone isn't hacked means it is restricted to where ever my phone is located. Also multi-sig could implement this if the signing authority required you to log in from a certain IP range to fulfil the second signature.

I live in Quebec, a place where my college tuition is free, if you choose to go on to university is it only about $4k a semester for tuition. The government pays it. I have free healthcare, you can send your kid to day care for free because the government pays for that too. Private schools are subsidizes, you get paid maternity leave, and I don't pay a water bill because that's free and even hobos deserve water. Healthcare of course is free. On a fun little note combined national and provincial debt here equate to less of a percentage of GDP than America's federal debt is of it's GDP. We still run this as a capitalist society. Feel free to start a business. Oh, but Obama, yeah, he's a socialist...

Got to admit that a pretty good comeback. People aren't exactly the greatest at making those electrical decisions there. Admittedly Bitcoin is also a bad example for the point I'm trying to get across. I hate Lawsky as much as you do. When you have something decentralized and there are so many ways that it permits there to be no need (or severely reduced need) to trust a third party cryptography then you shouldn't put laws in the place to make life hard. Bitcoin let's anyone create a website overnight that makes them an international money transfer, and that's beautiful. 
I just don't buy into those whole Austrian economics argument that the free market will solve all these problems faced from remorseless profit seeking corporations. That when I walk into a pharmacy and I look at two bottle of couch syrup in a society that has no laws I don't see people going off and taking an hour to Google the ingredients of each to find out if they are safe or if it slowly poisons them. If everyone did maybe the free market thing would work out. But we don't. We want everything now. We have short attention spans. We work 9-5 jobs. We don't have the time for that. IBM did deals with the Nazis and plaid a role in the Holocaust. Look at how many people still use them. BP polluted the gold coast, they cut corners and their well broke.

Yeah you should be able to and no one should be allowed to use any means of violence against you for making a decision about what company you use. 
What I'm saying is simply that this whole notion of saying a corporation did something bad so I won't use it (at least thus far) has been rendered ineffective in inhibiting many corporations from committing heinous acts. If *sensible* regulations created as a result of people like you and I getting together (that's the principle of which democracy is founded upon) allows us to act as a group to power the individual to take on the big powerful remorseless corporation and therefore prevent it from doing harm. Then I think that's good. 
Now maybe your rebuttal from that would be that it can't happen due to crony capitalism and admittedly there are examples of it (look at how many banks shouldn't exist today given their actions if '08 but they are around due to bailouts). For starts cronyism doesn't always exist. In the areas  it does my  response to that is let's get rid of the cronyism. The ability to do so,  that's something we will disagree on. We're still at the beginning of Human evolution. I'm not quite sure where we'll end up but even democracy is its infancy.

It doesn't make much  sense of a 2 of 3 set up like you think of holding your Bitcoin in a BitGo wallet nor does it to make a 2 of 3 set up for escrow like Localbitcoins. An exchange like Bitstamp is high liquidity and when a trade is executed it must be final. You can't give the end user the ability to refuse to sign as this then means the ability to dispute a trade. You can't have someone's Bitcoin sold for $300 and then have him refuse to release the funds because he saw  price hit $500. So you can't really have a decentralized holding  of funds with a good guy liquid exchange that serves as a live market. Instead all holders of the keys must be trusted parties that agree all trades are final. So BitGo with one key and Bitstamp with an other on their servers and Bitstamp with a secured offline key for the 3rd one would be more ideal as now not only does Bitstamp need to be hacked but so does BitGo. I don't know the specifics of how Bitstamp has set up their multi-sig. I'm just speculating as to different implementations that are suited for their needs.

Actually it makes a lot of sense. Think if you have gold in a bank they write you a receipt then you give that receipt to more than one person and then you trade the receipt for goods and you get fractional reserve lending. What differentiates bitcoins and gold here is that you can't send gold over the Internet and it is inconvenient to keep it in your wallet. So people started using the receipt for trade (a representation of the gold) . But with bitcoin you wouldn't want to accept a receipt for bitcoins held in the bank. You would instead want to accept bitcoins so that you know you have the real thing. Bitcoins then let you trade easily while being the actual scarce item as opposed a traded representation on the real item. 
Now this doesn't mean that lending isn't capable of being done but it works out to be much different and therefor our current view of fractional reserve lend is unique to fiat. 
For example with bitcoins a bank could promise interest for holding coins with them. Like with a term deposit. They then give those coins to other people but say you have the same amount. You can't spend them though until the term is up. Then you get them back with interest from earnings made from the borrower. You take a share and so does the bank. This also isn't really causing inflation as it is much more a kind to you lending out your coins. That or you can have a normal saving account and the bank keeps a high reserve hopes that people don't all take their coins out. 
Fractional reserve lending with bitcoin would be much more a kind to giving the gold out in a loan as opposed to a representation of it. If we all start trading a representation of bitcoins instead of actually bitcoins then bitcoins have failed as you would no longer be your own bank and you would no longer boycott the system that makes us use bitcoins instead you become part of it. In doing so bitcoins lose their value as value is met by demand and demand is created by being different than the current fiat system..

Coinbase was the previously wasn't an exchange, it was more like PayPal. So prior to today the only way to buy Bitcoin in Coinbase is essentially a market order. Coinbase would source Bitcoin from other exchanges, they would set a very large fixed spread (few dollars, Bitfinex us currently 1 cent spread for comparison), and charge 1% on top of that. Their users aren't choosing the price of Bitcoin, they are. Coinbase was serving as a redistributer of Bitcoin not the market maker. 
With an exchange it's different in that it supports both market orders and limit orders. This means that users now determine the price. You can place an asking price when selling and choose a Bid price when buying. When a seller and buyer match each others price the trade is executed and money exchanges hands. It's trade like a stock exchange. It's something  day traders can use, it's something where you can choose how much to pay and if someone will sell for that that becomes the market price. 
So essentially Coinbase use to rely on the market to determining the price and then fix the rate beyond that. Now Coinbase gives more advance users the ability to be the market and play a role in determining the prices and trading. Also an exchange has a lot lower fees. The user determines (much rather collectively influences) the spread (the gap between bid/ask) and according to techcrunch article the exchange is only a 0.25% fee (I presume this is lower for larger volume trades) also Coinbase exchange is zero fees until March. 
Given that the New York Stock Exchange is one of the biggest investors in Coinbase and Coinbase now has what will likely become the biggest US based exchange and most popular amongst Americans. That's big news.

I have CaVirtex account and got it back when their KYC was real lax. I started getting pissed off at them though. They keep upping their fees. They launched Interac Online and in beta I liked it. Then they boosted fee to ridiculous $25 per deposit. So I signed up for VOS because they had a $2.50 flat rate fee for Interac up to $2500 at a time because QuadrigaCX took their previously free Interac deposits and boosted it to 3% fee. But VOS shut down and QuadrigaCX dropped fee to 1.5% so I signed up there.  Then about a week ago CoinTrader added CAD order book and they accept Interac for a $2 flat rate fee up to $5000 per transfer. So that looks real promising. I hate not being able to buy Bitcoin instantly, it's really the only reason I keep my BMO account (for Interac). For time being CoinTrader has small CAD order book and I'm buying small amounts so I see no immediate need to switch and will use QuadrigaCX for now but if I need to move volume that might change in the future. I hate not being able to buy Bitcoin instantly. Slow fiat just kills the fun in panic buying.  I think I'm heading in the direction of using every Bitcoin exchange in Canada.

They can't actually trade tumbled coins unless they operate the tumbler or someone is tumbling such a large amount of funds that they can't avoid but to get back there own Bitcoin when withdrawing. 
Edit: Hum, they must of been the seller too if they could look up the mailing address and trace the transactions. Unless it when through a Bitcoin exchange with verified account and wasn't tumbled and the exchange then told them the Bitcoin address to investigate.

Bitcoin is a push system. It requires my personal authorization to send money. If you have my public key you can't just take money from me. My public key is all I exposed to you when I make a transaction. With a CC it's essentially giving everyone your private keys and then if they store that info it can be used to make a charge to you in the future without your authorization. So credit cards are inherently flawed and you need the ability to reverse the transaction because it is so easy for fraud to occur.  Bitcoin on the other hand has far less of a need to reverse a transaction as that theft won't occur in the first place.

It doesn't insure. Much rather it is random. Bitcoin and all aspects of cryptography are based on probability. That while in theory something is probable within practice it is so improbable that we consider it impossible (like finding a cryptographic break in AES256).
So the total possible amount of Bitcoin address is the fallowing number
    1,461,501,637,330,902,918,203,684,832,716,283,019,655,932,542,976
Effectively, we consider it to be infinite and we continually just generate random addresses because it is so improbable for someone to generate our address. If Bitcoin was required to look up to see if someone else had that address than it would mean that someone could easily disrespect the rule that says don't use that address. The absence of needing the check for addresses is also what makes cold storage possible.
So it's always important of course to have a good random number generator. If it is flawed then it's not truly random and someone else might generate your address. This is why some apps implement things like shaking your phone or moving your mouse randomly as it introduce "noise" to make numbers more random as a computer is never fully random on it's own.

Anyone doing any illegal activity isn't going to give a shit about a law banning cryptography. They'll do so anyways because not a force on this earth as long as you have Internet connection can stop you from being anonymous (eg. TOR) nor stop you from encrypting information. It's data, it's like trying to ban Torrents, good luck with that. There's a reason why I can still download TrueCrypt. You can't stop me. 
It only effects the overall surveillance sate and a few idiot terrorists on Facebook chat who are stupid enough to get caught without spying. The only power the law has on cryptography is telling Whats App not to use it. It's by telling Facebook not to develop end of end encryption. The only power the law can hold over cryptography is preventing it from being default. That's what the ever growing largely privatized military industrial complex's arm of the surveillance state and the corrupt government that backs  it wants.

Using that logic Litecoin is very silver like as Litecoin's supply is greater than Bitcoin. The blocktime is 2.5 min vs 10 min in Bitcoin while the block reward and time it takes to half is this same. This makes Litecoin's future total supply 4x that of Bitcoin.
Litecoin's logo is a silver color, Bitcoin takes all the glory and Litecoin is still number two in [market cap to Bitcoin]( as has it been for quite a long time and the foreseeable future (I exclude Ripple as it's essentially a corporate pre-mine). So gold is first place and silver is second place. Litecoin is the number two blockchain based cryptocurrency out there and Bitcoin number 1.

They also relay transactions. Like unconfirmed transactions and stuff

You can hold colorcoins or similar yourself independently of a brokerage in case of storage. Heck you could buy stock and send it to a multi-sig wallet. So you can securely encrypt and distribute those keys over various locations and require all or just multiple ones to transfer ownership of the stock. With a broker there is a chain of middle men straight to the NYSE and rely on them and can't withdraw your stock from that system.

This is how I like to explain tumblers. 
With Bitcoin every transactions can be traced. It's not anonymous it is however pseudonymous. It's important we can trace Bitcoin because that's how I know how much Bitcoin I have. I know I have 1 Bitcoin because I can tell that someone else had it and where there's came from and so forth. By tracing every Bitcoin back to its origin we create a currency that can not be counter fitted. The problem is. What if I don't want you to know where I'm sending my Bitcoin or where I received them from. 
A tumble is basically trading pseudonyms. So let's say there are 30 people in a room and we each have $100 all in $1 bills. Now we take out a top hat and all put in all the money. Now there is $3000 in a hat all in $1 bills. We mix up this hat and each take out $100. Now I get all $1 bills and they a came from pretty much all different people. Now my hundred was split up across various other people. With a computer it's possible to program it so I get none of my original dollars. Now correlating my initial  $100 with the activity of my new $100 can't be done (well, of course the could keep track so you would need to trust it not to).

In Electrum if you have dynamic fees enabled, which is I think the default. There's a slider on the sending tab for fees. Slide that too the max, otherwise it won't confirm right away. I think it's 150 Satoshi per byte the max, that's good. The default is in the middle. I sent it with fee in the middle last week and it took 8 hours. I did it with fee at max after and it confirmed on the next block. 
If you look here you can see how long it takes to confirm depending on fee. 
You can look up your transaction on a block chain explorer and it'll tell you the fee. Blockchain.info shows you on the transaction ID how many Satoshi/bytes the fee is. I've seen post on here saying Blockchain.info has a bunch  of bugs now, but I'm yet to encounter them and I don't know any other blockchain explorer that shows the fees paid.

He goes a little overboard in the one on fractional reserve banking blaming it for inflation. Arguably fractional reserves can bring about instability in the baking system and can be a contributing factor to increasing money supply. But the money multiplier is vastly exaggerated. It's about the maximum amount of money the banks could create but would require every bank in the chain to make the max. They simply don't as it brings on risk to the bank (which is risky arguably diminishing given bail-in and bail-outs). Countries with no reserve ratios aren't seeing banks print unlimited amounts of money. On top of that as a loan is paid back then the supply of money is reduced. So the monetary supply from fractional reserves should stay relatively stable as long as people make their payments. The real issue with inflation in the Central bank. All central banks are in a race to the bottom and they vastly increase the money supply with intent of meeting target rate of inflation, they also lend to private banks and seek to devalue their Nations currencies as currently implemented monetary theory says that's good (allows for increased exports). Central banking isn't an issue Mike seems to explore so much.

Still does beat credit cards for speed. See when you use a credit card it approves the transaction instantly, it doesn't send the money to the merchant instantly however it just says that you have enough in your account to make the purchase. Then in a few days time the merchant receives the money, but it's not confirmed and the transaction can be reversed within a few months time. PayPal changed their charge back window to 6 months because of their reliance on credit cards which are subject to fraud. 
Meanwhile with Bitcoin you get that approval right away too. It takes a few seconds for the transaction to propagate across the network and said transaction can be monitored for risk double spending by looking at how much it has propagated. Within a few seconds you know the customer has been approved for the transaction. Not much different than them for credit card there. However the big difference is that it typically only takes about 30 minutes to get enough confirmations that you can consider the bitcoin to be yours and the risk of the transaction being reversed essentially non existent. That part is indeed a lot quicker than credit card.

The problem is tog can't just go off make a huge blocksize because if only 20 Mb is needed and a block from hacked pool gets filled with Gigabytes of spam then the blockchain becomes to large. So 20mb is an extremely short term solution. But going. To large because  a problem. What truly is best is if the maximum is dynamic. Put in say a hard cap of 50,000 transactions per second and make it so that if the average amount of transactions that occur are 3 per second stick with 1mb cap. If average goes up automatically adjust to a larger maximum block size. Then to prevent abuse have a hard cap that can't by passed. This way the block size can scale with the popularity of the Bitcoin network.

With credit cards you expose your billing info to a merchant. They effectively must be trusted to keep this info secure. If they don't Target happens. With Bitcoin I don't need to trust the merchant to secure anything as you don't expose your private key to the merchant. When you leave the store after paying by credit card you can still be charged to that credit card. When you leave the store after paying by Bitcoin a charge can't be made to your Bitcoin wallet. 
You don't need to trust the merchant to know your public key, no matter how corrupt they are it's not an issue. You need to trust a merchant with your CC info because all it takes is a corrupt data base admin to sell that info on the darknets and charge your CC.

QuadrigaCX or CoinTrader. Both are good QuadrigaCX is higher liquidity but if you want funding by Interac to buy instantly then CoinTrader is much cheaper fee wise.
If your bank supports Interac Online then you can buy with little to no KYC using InstaBT.com of QuickBT, after you bought first time it will be Instant. These have small limits and high mockups. ATM's might be cheaper. They're is also Instacoins offering a similar service. Haven't tried them though,  I have the other two.
You can always find a Bitcoin [ATM here. There are plenty in Canada.](  
Exchange is always cheapest. 
Overall it's super easy to buy Bitcoin and if your bank supports Interac Online then you can deposit to an exchange instantly, an envy of much of the world. 
Edit: if you are buying via EFT (direct deposit) then QuadrigaCX is better choice than CoinTrader.

Not sure entirely what you mean.
If you have Bitcoin in a wallet on a computer then copy it to a USB key then you have a backup. However if you use a computer not connected to the internet (prefrebly using a live CD) to generate a wallet and send Bitcoin to that wallet from an online device and then save it on USB key it is in that case cold storage so long as the Bitcoin where never exposed to to device connected to the internet. 
The difference then is that a wallet contains extra data than just the private keys. For example an Electrum wallet is deterministic and so it's not just one key but several. It also makes it easier to restore and easier to encrypt the cold storage (encase of physical theft). Wallets contain other info like transaction history but that isn't relevant to cold storage as the wallet doesn't know transaction history without the internet. The reason why purely private keys are typically used is because its very easy to just print a private key on a peace of paper to make a paper wallet.

Coinbase doesn't stand to benefit from a small block. The increased fees as a result of small block size go to miners not other Bitcoin companies like Coinbase. A lot block size hurts Coinbase because it means less adoption and as a result less potential customers. In addition to this Coinbase pays the network transaction fees if their users. So small block we increases their operating expenses. 
Banks who do not use the blockchain stand to benefit as they currently offer a higher fee service than Bitcoin. Bitcoin with high fees means it can't undercut their business and steel their customers. Bitcoin with low fees means there is no need for a bank.

I started getting upset at CaVirtex given their fees. They now charge a ridiculous $25 for Interac Online deposit. So I signed up for VOS as they had a nice $2.50 flat rate for Interac. Anyways they shut down and I went to QuadrigaCX, they have no fees for deposits other than Interac at 1.5% which is expensive but no other option I went there. Now CoinTrader has started taking CAD deposits (they where USD only before) and they accept Interac Online for a flat rate fee of $2 so might just start heading there if they keep that up. Fee wise they are looking like they might be the new best but QuadrigaCX seems nice and they have much higher volume for the time being. Interac Online is really the only reason I'm keeping my BMO account. I hate not being able to buy Bitcoin instantly in a panic.

Worst case scenario a mining pool obtains majority hash rate. If they had 51% (aka 51% attack) this means that in 51% of the blocks mined (so 51% of the time) they could censor a desired transaction (or merely make it take longer as an other pool would need to mine it) additionally they could double spend 51% of the time. They wouldn't be able to steel people's Bitcoin or stop all transactions they want as they wouldn't have 100% of mining power.

Variance. Sometimes it's 2 minutes. Sometimes it's 10, sometimes it's 20. A 10 minute block time is just a target time. Bitcoin miners works by solving a math problem, a math problem made so difficult that it is as hard to solve as 10 minutes regardless of the size of the Bitcoin network. This is based on a probability, after all its more or less random as to who solves a block. So it is made that it is most probable a block is solved in 10 minutes. We can't really on time stamps because those can be manipulate so we really on the probability that the time it takes for the network to solve a block will be 10 min. What this means is that it is also probable that a block is found by miners in more or less than 10 minutes. So 10 minutes is more like an average time. If you look at a time span of 1 hour it will have 6 confirmations averaging it out to about 10 min. But each confirmation within that will have a different time taken to solve it.

Coinbase has it's own business account at a bank. FDIC only covers up to $250k in the event of a default (not that the government hasn't bailed out banks for far more than  that per account in the past). By having multiple bank accounts (I think it would need to be at different banks if I'm not mistaken) would mean up to $250k per account. We can anticipate that Coinbase likely has more than $250k at a time in an account. Meaning if the banks default they loose a lot of fiat which isn't insured. Gemini (at least from the looks of it, I can't confirm this) sounds like it's a different bank account for each user. In other words instead of $250k in total for Gemini in their bank account it would be up to $250k per user. 
Edit: Gemini might also be referring to how Americans are using foreign exchanges (Bitstamp, Bitfinex) where their countries bank's deposit insurances may not cover foreign currency (USD) and so by Gemini using a US based bank means FDIC is applicable to them for the business as a whole.

Mining pools can cap the blocksize. It can be in a pools incentive to limit block size so more fees must be paid (as low fees wouldn't fit in the block). Then come time that Bitcoin has the need for many more transactions the pools can increase their block size so more transactions can go through, they wouldn't want to hinder Bitcoins uses as they would then loose overall profit and prices of Bitcoin would drop.

You need the blocksize to be big enough to handle enough transactions per second on average. We also want the network to be able to handle spam and ddos  so it needs to be even higher than required amount of transactions. It does need a cap though because if not then the block can be spammed and you don't want a 200Gb block being created every ten min if it only contains 1 Gb worth of transactions. The blockchain would become far too large to store and nodes to handle.

You can run a perfect libertarian commune with a few hundred, maybe few thousand people, no government, no corporations, no war. The world was far different before governments, it was also a more deadly and violent time. I don't live in a city of a few thousand people. I live I a city in excess of a million. If you think that will function without government you have a very positive view of Human nature. Are people inherently good? Or are they inherently bad. You're optimistic in People's ability to do good. Human history teaches us otherwise and we act as a group for the benefit of a group because of the injustices that exist.

Well prices was pretty stable around the $130 mark before the start of the bubble. SilkRoad closure had it drop to about $80 and quickly recovered to $130 then the madness pursue. Arguably Bitcoin sees more demand for it now than it did then and Bitcoin is easier to use than ever, there are more places to buy it and more places to spend it. So I think it's fair to say there is enough support to keep it above the $130 mark. 
Also the Mt. Gox problem still exists, it's reminisces exist to this day and it has tarnished the view of Bitcoin in the eyes of the mainstream which now look at Gox as use it as reasoning to see you can just loose all your money in an instant, up gone and vanished. The Goxing continues.

I first heard about Bitcoin it was $30. But I didn't think enough of it. I was in high school then. If I had a job and didn't need my parents to wire money to Japan to buy Bitcoin I'm sure I would of then. I first bought Bitcoin at about $130 and saw some fun times on the run up to $1000. That's when the enthusiasm and greed kicks. Think I paid as much as $800 for Bitcoin. So yeah I'm at a loss now. But if I didn't buy more I'd be at a gain. 
A price is $1000+ wasn't justified. How much of that was corruption at Mt. Gox and Willy is unclear. But it was a crazy price with no hopes of being sustained. 
No here we are at $268, sure it suck but but wasn't log ago we saw a similar bottom and if this experience teaches me anything it is that Bitcoin today is quite successful. It's a far higher price than when I first heard about it and today it is easier to buy/sell Bitcoin as ever and it is easier to buy something with Bitcoin than ever before. I don't know when/if we will see an other hysterical climb. But if we do, we're ready  and it's going to be crazier than ever.

Yep banks create money. We think it's a fractional reserve and well, it is. Except that it's a fractional reserve of digital dollars which where created based on none other than other digital dollars. This effectively is the same as creating money. 
Now this idea of transferring the creation of money from the banks to government. In a perfect world sure,  but I don't see it happening. Banks create money then lend it out for interest and keep that interest as profit as they are not allowed to just fill their accounts with what they want, money. Now I guess the idea is let government do that and then it is safer. I would feel great getting a mortgage from the government at 0% interest, since it takes nothing to make that money in the first place to lend out why should I pay any interest on it? That will never happen though for if it did government would have figured it out to finance their own deficit spending. Then you and I would not need to pay interest on borrowed money and inflation would be curbed as you still pay back the money which was lent (by taking it out of circulation) the kleptocracy though is to strong between the government and banks for this change to ever happen. At least if you do it with a bank they pay out interest on deposits in return for lending. And if you don't live in America then you can find banks which pay out at percentages above the rate of inflation.

Yeah if I need cash Bitcoin would be nice. As a Canadian and having a bank that supports Interac Online I can buy Bitcoin instantly. So transfer to exchange instantly and withdraw then I have money on the other end of the world. No ATM fees. Could actually cost less than the 2.5% foreign currency transaction fee Cirrus will change me when withdrawing over seas. Thing is if I can pay 0% using a credit card that has no foreign currency exchange rate (Amazon.ca) then there isn't much reason to want cash or Bitcoin in the first place when that will cost more. So unless merchants give discount on Bitcoin Bitcoin will cost more for me as a traveller than free fiat options available to me.

There's no US exchanges accepting ACH (to my knowledge) due to complex regulatory environment of Americans iron first. So all the exchanges are in other countries. Some countries are doing quite well exchange wise (Canada has 3 domestic exchanges, not long ago that was 4). For starters I'm not quite the sure if you understand how an EFT works. That aside how can you expect an EFT (a representation of Bitcoin backed by reserves) to be successful if you can't trade the real thing in the richest country there is? By launching an exchange it has the potential to increase liquidity and price that the ETF will then benefit from.

Well the host presented that bad. But in reality not really. More liquidity is what is needed to reduce volatility. Regulation has no direct importance in reducing volatility however regulation makes the general public feel more safe when trading Bitcoin and makes it more accessible to them given that if you want to operate within the US you got to comply with US law. This increases the user base of Bitcoin and the amount of people trading  it. As a result this increases liquidity and reduces volatility.

I'm just a college student working a part time job. Wound up putting about 1/6th (maybe more) of my earnings last year into Bitcoin. Can I afford to loose that? Absolutely. If I need the money I would of invested in ETFs. Truth is at this point in my life the exact amount of money I need right now is $0. But do I want to loose $1000+? No. Still the last thing I'm going  to do is panic sell. I'm HODLing. I'm gonna ride out this bipolar bitch we call Bitcoin. I see something in it. Low prices are opportunities. They bring fear as uncertainty arises. But really Bitcoin is easier to buy or use than it ever has been. More places accept Bitcoin than ever. Bitcoin is still growing. When I first bought Bitcoin they where worth $130. In my mind that means Bitcoin is still succeeding. I just wish I had the foreknowledge to stop buying on the run up, the most I ever bought Bitcoin for was $800 and that was too high and stupid of me to think it was a valid decision. I'll know come next time. Life is a learning experience. We'll look back on this moment in a year and think of how stupid we where.

I take it you are in the US where strict KYC and AML and horribly slow dollars become a bit of a bottleneck for you. Sorry.

The Internet sure. But you're claiming the government is responsible for creating Bitcoin? What did they make other than SHA256 (which easily could of been replaced with something else)? Satoshi did what was previously impossible. He created Bitcoin, call that what have you but it wasn't government that made Bitcoin. 
You never heard of tumblers have you? Linking Bitcoin it's self to ID is very hard as no ID is required to use/spend/receive Bitcoin. But once a link is made it becomes very easy to identify transactions and fallow their path (unless explicit actions are taken otherwise). Still it's more anonymous than your bank account.

I have CaVirtex account and got it back when their KYC was real lax. I started getting pissed off at them though. They keep upping their fees. They launched Interac Online and in beta I liked it. Then they boosted fee to ridiculous $25 per deposit. So I signed up for VOS because they had a $2.50 flat rate fee for Interac up to $2500 at a time because QuadrigaCX took their then fee Interac deposits and boosted it to 3% fee. But VOS shut down and QuadrigaCX dropped fee to 1.5% so I signed up there.  Then about a week ago CoinTrader added CAD order book and they accept Interac for a $2 flat rate fee up to $5000 per transfer. So that looks real promising. I hate not being able to buy Bitcoin instantly, it's really the only reason I keep my BMO account (for Interac). For time being CoinTrader has small CAD order book and I'm buying small amounts so I see no immediate need to switch and will use QuadrigaCX for now but if I need to move volume that might change in the future. I hate not being able to buy Bitcoin instantly. Slow fiat just kills the fun in panic buying.

No, just as easy. It's just it's a different blockchain so if you trade BTC for LTC on Btc-e and then withdraw LTC to a Cryptsy account and trade for BTC now you are guaranteed to get different coins out of Btc-e instead of the same Bitcoin you put it (which you shouldn't anyways). But just by involving two different blockchains it allows you to insure you get something else than what you deposited. Also Litecoin is faster confirmation time so it's quicker to mix this way. The parent comment suggest using Btc-e for both accounts which is counter intuitive, two different exchanges should be used for this.

Slowness here is an advantage. Scrypt is slow because of it's high relience on memory. With SHA256 all you need is a new chip, a new chip and you have more hashing power. This means ASCIs develope really fast one fewer and fewer people are able to get powerful ASCIs as the moment they do faster ones are out. 
By increasing the resources needed (maily due to needing better RAM in addition to better processing power) now how much money someone needs to spend on high end hardware should in theory be much more relative to low end hardware than Bitcoin is. Due to weathly players being able to get less of an upperhand over the general population then scrypt in theory allows for a further decenteralized network than SHA256 even with ASICs. 
[IEEE wrote a good article about this.](
Scrypt's difficulty in computing is also the reason why it is used in BIP38 to encrypt Bitcoin paper wallet. It is far harder the bruteforce of even dictionary attack because it requires a lot more computing resources to acheive the same hash rate.

You can pay attention to only last 50,000 if you desire. But the previous ones much be kept accessible to all node paying attention to the recent amount from at least one source accessible to them. This is because you can't trust number 1 of the 50,000 because you need to verify the previous transactions to know that the first block of the 5k is legitimate. Not many copies would need to exist of the previous blocks so long as they are accessible to the public when needed. This is because the validity of this can be verified all cryptographically. So if anyone forges a byte it is picked up the moment someone pays attention. 
A full node or even a last 50,000 node can be trusted because those nodes communicated to enough nodes that had at least at some point verified every Bitcoin transaction that ever existed to know that the current block a miner himself can know  is legit.

It's because the block reward is halved every 4 years. So originally Bitcoin's block reward was 50 BTC. Currently it is now 25 BTC. In a few years it's 12.5 BTC, the pattern continues. Eventually the creation of new Bitcoin becomes very slow and that's why it takes so long. It was actually designed quite smart as it brings about enough into circulation to start and then slowly curbs the amount created to prevent inflation while allowing for adoption to grow enough to still have enough Bitcoin to incentive miners while transaction's aren't numerous enough for their fees to incentive miners and still be low.

Circle isn't an exchange. Coinbase isn't an exchange. Coinbase Exchange is an exchange. 
With Circle and the old Coinbase it's kind of like doing Forex with PayPal. They set the rate and give it to you at market rate plus fee (fixed spread). Other exchanges like Bitstamp, Bitfinex, is where the free market determines the rate live. Coinbase Exchange allows users to trade amongst themselves with Coinbase as a middle man that helps to initiate the transaction. With Coinbase Exchange users determine the price and spread, not Coinbase. You can place a limit order in an exchange and view order books and recent trades, candle sticks, etc. 
You can't place a limit order on Circle or Coinbase, you can on Coinbase Exchange. For the moment at any rate given that Coinbase Exchange is no commission until March then Coinbase Exchange is the  best place for Americans to buy Bitcoin and trade (legally).

Coinbase has much better banking relationships and uses ACH currently so we can expect Coinbase's exchange to accept ACH which makes it far easier and cheaper  for Americans to transfer in and out of the exchange instead of doing wires.

I don't know the specifics I'm not no lawyer but people have been charged for this before. Sure buy a car with $13k cash it's legal. I bet it'd be illegal though to trade $13k got Euros. I believe it is because they start treating it as a financial services where as selling a car isn't a financial service. I'm not even sure if a one time deal would count as illegal or if you'd need to be a seller making lots of sales for them to then view you as a money service business and then Fincen laws apply. I suppose it'd make for an interesting court case though. Because it's bitcoin currency? If seems that in regards to financial services around it government treats it as currency but for tax purposes however government treats it as a commodity. It can't be both. So I suppose court would need to establish it as one of that other. It'd be kind of funny if what it takes for bitcoin to officially be recognized as a currency is governments desire to prosecute people for violating money laundering laws. 
There was [a similar instance where guys where arrested in Florida for this.]( Although they were charged under state laws very similar federal laws exist.

I always get a good laugh out of the retail banking market in the US. Is the land that prides it's self on capitalism so reluctant to use competitors? Allow me elaborate. 
**Chase** (JPMorgan Chase biggest bank in US by assets)
Basic checking account: fee $10/m
Savings account: fee $5/m or $20/m (depending  on plan) if minimum balance isn't met. Interest on deposits below $50k 0.03%. Earn 0.1% on balances above $250k.
**Ally** (of the the larger direct banks) 
Checking account: $0/m pays 0.1% interest. Pays 0.6% on balances above $15k
**Synchrony Bank** (highest rate on savings account in the country available nation wide): 0.95% on all balances. 
Meanwhile elsewhere... 
**RBC** (largest bank by assets)
Basic checking: $4/m
Savings account: 1% on all balances above $5k
**People's Trust** (highest rate in the country): 2.5% interest on all balances. 
No my decimal places aren't a mistake. What's going on in the US that every single direct bank (Ally, CapitalOne360, Charles Schwab, Bank of Internet) all pay significantly higher interest on their bloody checking account than the big 4 banks do on their savings accounts? I can't find an other country where the big  bank are so shitty and still grasp the largest market share.

CapitalOne360 you can be overdrawn you only pay interest.

Bank of internet on the other hand if you read overdraft page they say they don't charge you but they aren't lending you money, they just source the money from your savings account either with them or other bank. So it's a transfer of funds, not borrowing.

Well thank you. I don't recognize your user name though you do mine, which you probably find quite ironic. But no, it was chosen wisely. Much of the Libertarians on this sub seem to forget one this. Statist hate the government also.
 I don't like regulations either (when they don't make sense), and I agree we don't live in a free society. While I'm not an anarchist I do support cryptoanarchy. The ability to forcibly strip the state from the ability to suppression information, limit freedom of speech or invade my privacy is something I'm entirely in favour of. 
Statist does not equate a love for state. It's a different vision for  government and what it is possible for government to be. There are many possibilities of which we are yet to see and governing is something meant to evolve along side human evolution. I think it's safe to assume I grew up under a far different government than you. Maybe if I didn't my mentality would be more like yours. But it's not.
I support your right to go out and make a [seastead](  it would be interesting to see what the out come would be. Getting a bunch of like minded people together. I don't invasion success for you, but experimentation is key. I'll happily come visit, it'll be a great place to party. Then I'll go home for the free health care. 
Part of what I'm getting at is you can't get in someone's head based on a few words they say. I go off listen to a 3 hour long podcast between Joe Rogan and Stephan Molyneux and you know what. I come out with a different perspective of the latter than when I first went it. You can't judge a book by its cover yet human psychology is so quick to think other wise.

They don't trade easily. With Coinbase currently they set a spread and then a 1% fee. With Coinbase's exchange users create the spread by setting limit orders. We can anticipate a much lower fee also. It also means easier flow of money in and out the exchange at a lower cost as we can anticipate ACH support meanwhile if you want to use Bitfinex or Bitstamp you need to wire the money.

There's no point in making 2 Btc-e accounts. You can put Bitcoin in take it out and you get different Bitcoin. If you want the Litecoin approach to be more anonymous it's a better idea to deposit Bitcoin to Btc-e then trade for Litecoin send those to other than altcoin exchange and trade for Bitcoin then withdraw. Now you are guaranteed to have different Bitcoin also you don't put 100% trust in Btc-e about your activity much  rather both Btc-e and say Cryptsy or whatever both need to cooperate with each other and both need logs to know who you are and where your transactions went.

Travel the world. Pay in Bitcoin. Credit cards for starters often have a 2.5% or so forex fee. Also you can't make a purchase on your credit card from a foreign IP address. The merchant will deny it due to address being too far off, it is too high of a fraud risk. This means you are stuck paying in person with the CC, if Bitcoin is used foreigners can pay for their ride while it's on it's way or directly to the company with no need for POS on board.

If USD wallet isn't offered in your state than neither is Coinbase Exchange. The reason it isn't instant is that ACH is slow (you can blame the Fed for that), go to Europe and use Coinbase it's a lot faster due to SEPA. The American approach for instant is to use credit cards and that's what Circle seems to favour. But when Coinbase Exchange and/or USD wallet is available in your  state then you can transfer the money there and hold it and only buy when you desire. For the time being I see a lot of posts talking about how Coinbase isn't first regulated exchange and the CoinX is (it is [also licensed in a lot more states]( so you might want to check them out. Don't know how good they are though.
Edit: You can also just buy on Circle or Coinbase then transfer to BTC-E or something and sell for USD then hold USD in BTC-e (or Bitstamp or BitFinex but BTC-E doesn't require verification so it's easier) and just buy Bitcoin when you desire.

Those Bell modems with built routers are  horrible. They default to WEP encryption and then requiring user to enter this randomly generated 30 something character long password written on the router.

 WEP is known to be very easy to hack and should never be used. But because of being default I'd estimate that about 90% of all BellXXX access points can be hacked into in no more than a few minutes. It's absolute retarded that even on the newer Bell Fibe modems they default to WEP.

It's actually based on probability. Nothing  in Bitcoin directly says that a block is 10 minutes. Much rather it says that with X amount of computing power making up the entire network it is most probable that a block will be solved in 10 minutes. Every so many block (which given 10 target  works out to be about 3 days,  I forget the exact number rid blocks)  difficulty will adjust to keep it so that the math always remains difficult or easy enough for block time to remain approximately 10 min regardless of the total computing  power of the  network. This is why sometimes a block is 2 minutes. Sometimes you see 3 blocks solved each within a time span of 10 min. Other times a block might take 20 min.  This is because it's only probable that it takes 10 min. This means it's also probable that it can take far more or far less. But we anticipate it not to differ a lot from 10 min as it is statically improbable to be for example one hour+, still 30 min for a block isn't uncommon. But overall across a large enough time span it averages out to 10 minutes as that is the target time. This also means that should the hash rate drop significantly very fast that it will take far more than 10 min on average. Because defiantly changes after a preset amount of blocks this means that it could easily take more than 3 days to adjust. As things stand the current average block time is 9.66 min according to Blockchain.info

Interac Email Money Transfers cost $1 to $1.50 usually, they are almost instant but can be reversed. Sellers still use it just like how some do PayPal but it is prone to charge backs from fraud. There was once an exchange that used them and had lots of fraud.

Yes he did violate money transmission laws. He was selling $13k of bitcoin to an undercover cop. In the US it is illegal to transfer over $10k  without being a money service business which must then report a transfer of over $10k to the government. This has happened before anyone selling bitcoins in cash should know by now that you must cap you're transactions at $10k to prevent you from violating said laws. They're also alleging that this is drug money or in connection to it. Then in addition to this he's not allowed to use the Internet because he was convicted for child pornography.

I think the way it works is the backend is decentralized (you don't need email to run a node for example) but that the Storj site asks for email because there you're really just signing up for a front end that allows the devs to make a profit and the average joe to pay with a credit card (rather than Storj coin). I'd have to assume there's an exchange somewhere that let's you buy Strojcoin with Bitcoin and a way to use the network directly. 
@_date: 2016-01-26 23:54:24
No, if half of the full nodes were controlled by one person and said person decided to violate the rules of the network given that all nodes come to a unanimous conscious of the sate of the network then a violations of said rules would cause a fork. 
This means that two different networks would exist. They would have the same history but different futures. Users like you and I can choose which blockchain to use. As long as each can sustain enough hash power to keep it secure they could both exist as parallel networks. Two different coins. If the networks divert to much each others miners may not be compatible with the others networks.  Of course that's rather unlikely as the market would choose the  preferred, as such it's reflected in price and miners that are able to compute the desired hashing algorithm fast enough will use it.
 So the network  as a set of individuals and their configurations in a pseudo-democratic matter choose the rules of the network.   
Your thinking of a 51% attack. Which refers to the miners not the nodes. Truth is a 51% attack is no different than a 10%, 30%, 40%, 60%, 90% attack. The only different is the probability that the attack can do what he wants. 51% saying that the ordering of transaction he can accomplish most of the time. Even then the attacker is wrong 49% of the time so eventually confirmations that are correct occur but the probability of the network reflecting accurate ordering of transactions changes depending on the probability they will solve the block.

ETF: Exchange Traded Fund
It would make a Bitcoin investment fund traded like stock on a stock exchange. So people can invest in it through their stock broker. Additionally being on a major regulated stock exchange means it can be put in tax sheltered account (eg. for retirement, etc) so it allows people to track the price of Bitcoin without actually having to deal with Bitcoin directly all the while avoiding regular capital gains tax if they put it in a tax sheltered account.

US is worlds biggest financial market. A US listed stock exchange makes it easily available to the biggest market and by extension the world. It's far easier for someone outside of the US (as well as for someone in the US) to buy an ETF on a major US stock exchange than in an other country. 
If you're in the US for example and you want an ETF in Canada you'll need to find a broker that support Canada as many don't. If you're in Canada sure it's just as easy for me to access the US market as domestic but if I want to buy say the Bitcoin ETN in Sweden I'll have a harder time finding a broker to do so and have to pay higher fees as a result.

Circle is just complying with the law. This isn't uncommon with Bitcoin. Pretty much every way to move any decent amount of money requires this. Roughly all Bitcoin exchanges do this if not they break the law or operate in a country that doesn't care. If you sign up for a brokerage account or a bank or a certain level of personally identifying information is required. This carries based on transaction volume/limits on the accounts and what the nature of them are. 
They are complying with KYC and AML laws (Know Your Customer, Anti-Money Laundering). Now exchanges target higher volume and consider it necessary to do this. However the law says companies are only required to comply with KYC/AML if their clients surpass a certain transaction volume. Circle takes this sort of model (as does PayPal) sign up and use the account in a flash. Move excessively large amounts of money and surpass limitations  then both services require proof of identity. I don't know the specifics of Fincen's guidelines but if I recall correctly it's after $3000 worth of transactions (either straight up or over a certain period of time) where the MSB (Money Service Business) must require ID and documentation to prove who you are. It is transactions $10k+ which then must be reported to the government.

If you are a merchant and your average sale is $30. Now you make 30 sales a day. That's $900 a day processed. This adds up to $2700 a month or  $324,000 a year. Both Stripe (no monthly fee) and PayPal (only some plans no monthly fee)  both charge 2.9% (for US and Canada sales). This is $9396 paid in fees per year. If so much as 0.1% of your sales is fraudulent then that means you lost $324 to charge backs. Then over the course of a year you made 10950 sales (30x365) with the $15 fee charged to the merchant for a charge back this means 11 sales that where charge backs occurred. This costs $165. 
Conclusion: With  credit cards in this example a merchant would save $9885 a year.

Then explain to me how if a private corporation runs an electrical company that has a monopoly on a region that they could ever do so more fairly than a government meant to server the people running this monopoly? 
Now if there was competition by all means it would be reasonable but we don't see competition in an area like this. Point me to an example where people can choose their electrical company like they cab a cell phone carrier. 
Now if your rebuttal is that government doesn't server the people anyways. Then fair enough, but you are then making the assumption that the corporation with a monopoly would sever the people. This is of course unreasonable when they don't need to compete for your business. So that argument trying to dismiss me would be invalid.

Holding a lot of money in Bitcoin is hard if you aren't good with tech, you got to learn private keys, cold storage, etc. But you actually own the Bitcoin. With an ETF you never hold it. You pay a management fee for someone else to hold it. You can put an ETF in a RIA, TFSA, that kind of stuff so it has tax advantages.

ETH wasn't designed with the legacy 1 MB block limit 10 min confirmation time that Bitcoin has. It's new generation crypto. So it's faster and can scale far far better than Bitcoin. Ethereum doesn't have block size limit. Rather if I understand it right it has a dynamically adjusting transaction limit for continually adjusting to confirm the the resources devoted to it by nodes and miners. 
Even Litecoin scales far better than Bitcoin (and it's basically the same thing) they only difference is a few little tweaks they increases capacity. 
Plenty of newer  alts have addressed the scalability problem in various ways. Bitcoin just never has because it'd be a too radical change from what Bitcoin is currently.

You also have to take into account Bitcoin's code.

An alt would only face the same transaction capacity problems as Bitcoin if it was as popular should an alt have the same transaction capacity hard coded into it (alts don't they had the liberty to address the network scaling capacity that Bitcoin doesn't).

How do they run their own servers? They do it themselves. 
I'm not saying they aren't using Bitcoin. From these posts it seems they are. There are however still  opportunities  companies may see to use their own private implementation of blockchain technology. Like a middle ground between centralization and decentralization. Perhaps mitigating security risk by having multiple central offices take part in their own network with no one office needing to trust the other. Or restricting the blockchain to do things Bitcoin's blockchain doesn't permit. Not sure, who knows? The blockchain holds much undiscovered potential outside of the implementation we currently envision with Bitcoin. 
Of course if decentralization is your primary objective then yes it makes most sense to use the most popular public blockchain which is Bitcoin.

You misunderstand LN. As I understand it it allows transactions to be done though a third party however it uses Bitcoin (or an other blockchain) as an arbitrator to circumvent the third party should the third party refuse to send transactions and hold funds random. If you had it go entirely though a third party than it wouldn't be Bitcoin, it would be something centralized. LN allows for a decentralized backing but permits users to transact off chain when it's not required to use the blockchain therefore freeing up space on the blockchain.

With an ETF I'd pay less taxes than not. I call legally invest in a Bitcoin ETF tax free (at least here in Canada in my TFSA). I can't do that with actual Bitcoin that I'd have to pay capital gains on. There's some food for thought. A Bitcoin ETF means less tax revenue for governments as it makes a high growth assets eligible for preferential tax treatment that comes with ETFs that otherwise couldn't be obtained. 
Also if no one owns actual Bitcoin then the ETF is useless. An ETF tracks the price  of an index, said index is the aggregated price between Bitcoin exchanges that trade actual Bitcoin. 
Bitcoin will continue to be used because Bitcoin has an actual utility. You can transaction in it, you can't transact with an ETF. If can send Bitcoin around the world with ease giving everyone access to the cryptocurrency financial network, an ETF is still engrained into traditional financial networks and all those who don't live in rich countries do not have access to it. 
You can buy gold as an ETF, that doesn't mean people don't buy and own physical gold.

There is a huge problem with this. If they wipe thenselves you lose all your bitcoins. This is where my suggestion above comes in. If you loose the card the wallet provider has a key and so do you. Now you got your bitcoins. Or if the wallet provider disappears now you still have your bitcoins with your backup and card. This is also useful as mutlisig allows for instant confirmation. The other problem with your approach is you are saying keep the private key in the card? If so this means that all POS terminals act as a keylogger and that your private key is always exposed to them. This is why credit cards are so bad. But with credit cards you can call up the credit card company to reverse a charge. With bitcoin it is gone. With multisig we have the opportunity to be better than that. So let's do it.

Big banks have motivation to shun bitcoin. The big banks make millions in fees every year. Meanwhile CapitalOne360 charges no fees and their checking account pays more interest than big banks savings accounts in the US (no joke). So a no fee bank doesn't have any reason to fear a no fee payment network. They might as well get involved if it makes their operation more efficient.

Given the size of hard drives and ever increasing capacity I don't see that being much of an issue. Storage is affordable enough that an increase to 2 MB today is sustainable. By the time we need 4 MB hard drive capacity will have grown substantially. 
Also the blockchain it's just text right? The size could significantly be reduced using lightweight compression algorithms like lz4, snappy, or lzo, it would have minimal performance impact but could save significant amount of space. I suppose implementing this into core would be most ideal but running your node atop of ZFS or Btrfs you can already achieve on the fly compression using  lzo (btrfs), lz4 or even gzip (on zfs).

It's using SSH to encrypted and avoids SSL/TLS. So not sure what authentication means as the article mentioned. 
But in regards to what would be most viable is how SSH sessions keep track of the hosts they connect to and store their fingerprint locally. Same way w log in with servers. The initial connection can't really be confirmed, it's up to the user to compare the fingerprints if desired. However the finger print is then stored in a trusted pool of fingerprints. If the fingerprint of this node  changes then it may be a man in the middle so connection is then refused. So no CAs involved.

In the future when  the blockchain becomes huge I don't think people will mind much leaving that node for say 2 or 3 days if their intention  is to run it 24/7 for months, or years (as most miners would) then it doesn't matter much that the initial sync had some wait time. As for the average consumer, well, they're already using thin wallets so sync time is irrelevant.

Nodes create a P2P network and a set of rules, miners then latch on to which ever blockchain they want to enforce the rules of. The more nodes who adhere to a certain set of rules the more inclined miners are to adopt the norm. Nodes that support segwit right now are only about 50%. If eventually enough people ran new nodes they'd outpace the older ones and we'd see 90%+ support on nodes, at which point many miners will support it as well as it becomes a norm of the Bitcoin software. 
If you want to do more buy a miner and point it at a Segwit supporting pool.

It's probably because of the large amount that was sent to you and you tried to withdraw. Under KYC/AML laws usually a business can offer you the service absent ID but once amounts increase beyond a certain value, either the amount in your account as a whole, or the amount transfered over a certain time span then by law they need your ID and info. This varies by jurisdiction and may vary by both the jurisdiction you live and where the business is located. It's like how for example I can go to downtown Montreal there's a business that sells bitcoin for cash. I can buy/sell for up to $3000 no ID or nothing but try to buy/sell for a penny more and now I need to provide ID so the business doesn't violate money laundering laws.

Learn how to secure your own computer and safely back up your bitcoin and then use a wallet like Electrum to store the Bitcoin yourself. When you store it yourself though it's your sole responsibility. If you hold $10k in a wallet and forget your password or the wallet is corrupt or hard drive dies  and you don't have a backup or a virus is on your computer and steels your password you lost all your money. Which is why services like Xapo exist they manage the bitcoin, secure them, the trade off is they control your money you don't. 
The benefit to your own wallet is you control your bitcoin and no one else. The trade off is it is your responsibility and yours alone that you secure your bitcoin and keep backups without loosing it.

I'm assuming not. It sounds like  what  this is is basically nodes creating SSH sessions to each other. This would hide the actual data that is sent over the network, between nodes, maybe even to your wallet. Actual transactions as they are in the act of being propagated get encrypted. 
The blockchain still works as is now. If you reuse addresses then transactions can be correlated. That's why it's important to use deterministic wallets. I don't see how the data on the blockchain it's self could be encrypted as bitcoins design requires it to be public. Bitcoin can't be counterfeited because I can trace every single bitcoin back to its origin when it was first mined. As such I can prove it's real. If this was encrypted then everyone would need to be able to decrypt it, which would make using encryption counter intuitive.

Yeah when you deposit money in the bank it is the banks not yours and they take that money and lend it out to other people for a profit. Yet your account still says it has the money in it that you put but that's not necessarily base money but rather bank credit they don't have all that money that account balance rather is what they owe you. That's why if everyone pulls out at the same there is a run on the banks and the system collapses.

I'm always a little confused by how people measure compression ratios. Generally I think 25% though means the end result is 25% the size of the original. So 25% would  be better than 50%. 
It's the size of data compressed vs uncompressed rather than the percentage trimmed off the original. 
Notice how in the above gzip is 28% and bzip2 is 25%. Bzip2 is a stronger compression algorithm so it's safe to assume that it would result in a smaller file size. Seeing how the percentage is a smaller number we can further conclude that a lower number means better compression ratios. 
[This benchmark compression ratios use the same logic. Smaller percentage is better ratio]( 
Of course the above blockchain test didn't give us insight on the strength of each compression ratio. For example gzip at level 9 will yield much better results than level 1. Maybe your rest was dependant in different algorithm or compression level of said algorithm.

Key word "*public* education." I don't think I need to explain the rules of supply and demand to you, I'm sure you understand that. The thing is demand only increases costs due to the for profit incentive. If one person will pay more than the other then I want money so I'll charge the higher price. 
The purpose of publicly funded education though should not be to charge the highest price the market can bear but rather to provide a service to the people. This means regardless of demand price can remain low because government can ignore the desire to charge a higher price for the demand. 
Think ([once you exclude the socialized medicine part and calculate costs]( healthcare in Canada costs less than healthcare in the US. Yet if you judge by wait times it would be evident that healthcare is more in demand in Canada. So why is it less? Perhaps because for profit incentive doesn't exist when the service is provided for free. So supply and demand gets ignored in regards to the cost to the end user (of course not fully ignored, but to an extent). 


Yeah kind of overstated that one. I'm referring to interest government makes on student loans but even then governments inevitably loose more on education than they bring in.

It's probably a fairer statement to say it's manipulated rather rigged. Rigged seems to imply the economy is controlled, you are right in that no economy is fully controlled  especially a capitalist economy. The economy is just a term for a lot of little individual pieces and how these pieces behave collectively is the economy.

Sure. But the thing is that on any algo ASICs are an eventuality. A coin having ASICs is a sign of it's success not it's dismay. If there's a GPU minable coin then that means all it takes is one person to figure out how to make an ASIC for it and then they have more hashrate than the entire network of GPU minable coins and can easily attack it.
But if ASICs already exist for an algo then it's not susceptible to attack by someone who can create an ASIC because their competitors already have ASICs. So ASICs aren't a bad thing. They close the biggest attack vector and that is the risk of absolute centralization of mining because someone devlops one to compete against GPUs.
ASICs prove the legitimacy of coins. Not the other way around.
No doubt more competition is needed in the ASIC market to help decentralization. But they're an eventuality. Just switching algos every now and then doesn't work out. Just look at a failure of Vertcoin. We need different solutions other than changing algos to GPUs to scave off the threat of centralization with ASICs. Perhaps like what Decred has adopted with the hybrid POS/POW model where stake holders act as an extra check and balance over miners and can vote on forks instead of just screaming at each other on Reddit.

Neither do a bunch of Redditors.
Also pools aren't a dozen individuals. Most of the hashrate on a pool isn't controlled by them. It's countless other miners that allocate their hashrate to a pool so they don't have to deal with variance. They are free to move to a different pool any time they want that signals for something else. If the miners at a given pool didn't agree with Segwit2x they'd move to a different pool that fits their beliefs.

Not really a dividend. If Segwit2x hard forks at block 494,784 with  the 93% of the hashrate currently pledged to do so then this means that 93% of the hashrate jumps ship 43% of the way into the 2016 block difficulty readjustment window of Bitcoin. 
This means that the current chain kills its self as blocks take several hours to mine and several months for difficulty to retarget causing all users and miners to ditch the chain. The Segwit2x chain then becomes Bitcoin. 
Bitcoin has consensus rules for in the event of a hard fork. If a large chunk of miners split off both chains are given a chance to survive and compete. But if an absolute majority of miners fork then the current chain concedes. Bitcoin really is amazing.

With 16,482,813 BCH in circulation at a $200 million market cap would mean BCH would be $12 each. It's probably fair to say it can at least for the foreseeable future stay with a market cap above Doge. So I figure it going down to $20-$50 is a reasonable price target.

There's a system of checks and balances in Bitcoin that is that nodes police miners and miners police nodes. 
Node count isn't too relevant. Anyone can spring up a bunch of nodes without much resource. This can then lead to a Sybil attack and this is why we have miners. 
In addition to miners being used to order transactions there are various circumstances in which miners are used to resolve consensus.
 For example in a soft fork nodes fallow the longest chain. If BIP141 didn't have majority hashrate then UASF nodes would of caused a chain split and only UASF nodes would of fallowed the Segwit chain but not core nodes as they fallow the chain with the most proof of work and most miners weren't behind this. But because miners activated  BIP91 the majority agreed to activate Segwit and 100% wound up signalling it or the blocks would of been orphaned. Chain split avoided, consensus resolved not by nodes but by miners who ensured all nodes fallow the longest chain, their chain. 
Nodes also enforce police consensus rules in the event of a hard fork. If a minority of the hashrate forks Bitcoin remains unaffected, the minority chain is an alt. 
If a large chunk of the hashrate hard forks but a large chunk remains then this is a contentious hard fork both chains survive and get to battle it out. 
But if an absolute majority of the hashrate like with Segwit2x which has 93% signalling ends up forking in the middle of the 2016 block difficulty readjustment window (like Segwit2x does) then what happens is the difficulty on the legacy/core chain is retained form when 100% were mining it but  since 93% forked and only 7% remains then this means that blocks take several hours to solve and difficultly several months to readjust. This means users will ditch this chain because transaction will take 6 hours and growing and since mining rewards is so far and few so will miners (thus further increase block times and time to difficulty readjustment). 
So Bitcoin by its own consensus rules declares such a fork not to be contentious and concedes to the fork by killing the legacy chain. 
Remember it is not you or I that define consensus in Bitcoin it is as you yourself said, nodes, and one of such rules nodes define is that miners get to resolve contentious upgrades to the protocol. 
Additionally there are nodes that support Segwit2x so not 0% and since after the fork currently existing core nodes will have declared themselves dead and won't do anything then these users will have to upgrade their nodes.

It's that the sum of transactions are settled onchain but all the little transactions that are done to add up to the end result is transacted offchain. So it's like there's check points on chain and most transactions can be done offchain while batching up the results of these transactions every now and then.
So if I understand it it's like saying Alice sends Bitcoin to Bob to pay for a coffee and a bunch of other people like Jimmy, Louis, Dylan do this to send Bitcoin to Bob for a coffee too over LN.
Then Bob takes a cut and sends these Bitcoin's to a supplier to pay for the coffee and then the supplier takes a cut sends these Bitcoins to some farmer in Columbia over LN.
Now those little steps happened in reality  and resulted in lot of transaction but the end result that is that Bob has some, supplier has some, and farmer some and customers have less. So what can then be settled onchain is just Alice sent Bitcoin to Bob and Louis and Jimmy to the supplier, and Dylan to the farmer. Now what we see onchain is the end result and it meant much less transactions onchian to achieve that result (the settlement) as all the inbetweens conducted to come to this net sum were done offchain.
Does that make sense?

You're making the assumption that the rules current nodes decide what Bitcoin is. That you're wrong about. Neither you, nor I, nor miners decide what Bitcoin is. The market does. Node's just define what chain they fallow and people call this chain by what ever label they want and the one which the market adopts as Bitcoin is Bitcoin. I'm not saying that different hard fork rules will become Bitcoin, but it's naive to think that it can't become Bitcoin.

Even if it does wind up being only 25% while that might not make it much worth wild in terms of propagating new blocks that's still a significant savings in storage space for a full node. Think if the blockchain becomes 500 GB and you shave off 25% to store the same data now we're talking a 125 GB savings.
I came across this, suggests 30% savings in size using snappy.

No they can't. They can crack down on it. But they can't effectively ban  it. It's like how Evey government bans piracy yet you can torrent anything in any country and the government can't stop that. 
It's like how China censors the internet and makes decent illegal. But if you know what you're doing it's really not that hard to get around the great firewall of China you just  a good VPN or to use hidden TOR nodes. 
Government can sure crack down on Bitcoin and subsequently hurt the hash rate. But the only way to ban it is to either shut down the internet entirely or get the unanimous consent of the Bitcoin community (which won't happen) . That's the beauty of decentralization. 
Edit: Plus futures can actually reduce volatility.

They are but you wouldn't want to invest in them. Any investor around the world in the weed market knows Canada is where the action is at. 
 US federal legalization isn't going anywhere so they aren't gaining the growth and expansion that Canadian MJ stocks are given imminent and promised federal legalization in Canada. Canadian pot  stocks have out preformed Bitcoin in 2016 and wouldn't be shocked if they do for 2017/2018 too. Can't say that about US MJ stocks because of it being federally illegal which keeps venture capital out of the market.
 Canada will be the first country to be home to multinational weed corporate giants (already is, CGC has product in Germany and a subsidiary in Brazil and they're largest MJ stock by market cap in the world). By the time US finally gets around to federal legalization who's to say the Canadian companies haven't gotten so big that they'll just swallow up the smaller American players and will be the dominate MJ companies in the US too.
Also for those in Canada you can invest in Canadian MJ stocks tax free in a TFSA as they're listed in  Canada. The US ones aren't listed on major stock exchanges like NASDAQ and NYSE but rather on OTCMarkets and Canadians can't get tax free and tax deferred treatment for OTCMarket listed securities (or Bitcoin for that matter). 
The bigger Canadian stocks are also listed on OTCMarkets for easy access by American investors but if you want to trade or buy any substantial amount you'll need to do it on the Canadian listing as that's where all the volume is. The big ones like CGC (the only one on the TSX) has seen unprecedented large trading volume. 
The legislation to legalize is expected in the spring of this year. So you'd want to get in before that.

Well nodes determine rules. Miners determine the order of transactions. They chain transactions together as a blockchain because nodes can't be trusted to say that one transaction happened after the other. They could claim transaction A happened before B when in reality B happened before A. 
They both work in conjunction with one and other. They need to both agree with each other because if they don't the blockchain would fork. Of course if (new) miners didn't adopt a new blockchain then the old would be more popular and new one die off (or be vulnerable to attack form lack of mining power). 
Basically nodes decide what the rules are. Miners just decide which set of rules they direct their mining power to in order to secure the associated  blockchain. So in other words miners don't entirely decide the rules. They just decide which rules are worth enforcing.   
Hopefully that makes sense.

They would of already gone to BCH if they're doing so for Segwit because this day was a given once BIP91 locked in.

If you're a trader the more volatility the better. In fact if your an investor it can be too because volatility provides better entry points and exit points which is why Bitcoin sees such large growth. Without volatility growth would be slow.

@_date: 2017-08-04 00:41:02


A 51% attack can't make coins out of thin air. Miners order transactions. Nodes validate them. All a 51% attack can do is double spend or sensor transaction. I don't think you much understand how transactions are validated.
You don't need to trust the network that your coins are real or not. All you need to do is trust your node. The reason why I know I have X amount of Bitcoin is because I can run a node that checks that digital signatures match the public key to corresponding addresses and see how they were chained together and confirm that such a chain wasn't manipulated because of the hash sums that are used to chain blocks together.

Capital is not above the state in the US. 


Really? What about private military contractors?

I don't disagree with your premise necessarily. America isn't the kleptocracy that is Russia.

Mempool is nearly empty only because people weren't transacting because of the risk of chain splitting and wipeout posed by UASF BIP 148. We can already see that now that UASF clearly hasn't caused a chainsplit that mempool had gone from empty to filling back up. Soon there will again be a backlog. This is inevitable.
As for lightning sure, for the foreseeable future this will take care of Bitcoin's scaling problem. Untill we hit a $200 billion+ or so market cap and and LN get's bottlenecked by 1 MB blocks at which point mempool will again be full, we'll be paying high fees again, and waiting for confirmations. If it's possible to get consensus to make the upgrade now with a $40 billion market cap isn't that a heck of a lot  less risky than doing it when we hit the 100 billions or even trillion mark?

As I understand it Segwit gets to avoid the hard fork and be a soft fork. But to increase the block size it's self (as segwit can only increase it minimally with a soft fork) then a hard fork would be needed.
 Capacity can still be expanded outside of a hard fork (think of Lightning Network) but I believe eventually demand will catch up to it and block size will need to be increased. At which point either a hard fork will be a requirement to increase capacity or users will have to adopt altcoins that didn't have the block size limit issue from the start and have already addressed the issue.
Of course it could maybe be a good thing that Bitcoin (not wanting to risk a hard fork) must innovate in some yet to be discovered manner that addresses the issue through some means which wouldn't otherwise be invented if the block size was just bigger from the start. 
I'm no expert myself on the block size controversy and differing  proposals to expand it though.

The chain split they were looking to avoid wasn't BCash. It was a chainsplit caused by UASF and/or BU.

They don't need to run a full node to participate in using Bitcoin to conduct commerce. The vast majority of users rely on SPV wallets.
If block sizes are too small people in the third world won't be able to conduct commerce in the first place because fees will be so high that even opening/closing a payment channel will be too expensive for them. Then Bitcoin becomes a first world commodity and they must use altcoins in the third world.

@_date: 2017-08-16 23:50:09
You fork get one major thing. It'll take several months for difficulty to readjust if 80-95% of the hashrate ditches it. The Segwit2x hard fork occurs 43% of the way into the 2016 block difficulty readjustment window. With blocks taking several hours to be solved this means it'll take at least a few months before difficulty retargets. At which point the legacy chain will be long abandoned. 
Segwit2x is signalling at 93% right now. That is no where near miners being "indifference".

If Bitcoin goes up 100%+ annually and you're paying 0.1%-0.5% annually in management fees that's not that big of a deal.

I don't see how his statements then really contradicts his views today either. The guy isn't a BU dev he's a Segwit2x dev. 
He recognizes the value and need for small blocks and efficient transactions and that the market has a final say. But he also recognizes the reality when now faced with it that far too small of blocks is problematic and that the market can't decide unless presented with the opportunity to do so. A lot of people on this thread seem to think the market is on their side. Don't fall for your own confirmation biases.

Yeah it is. My point is though that the block size increase from Segwit is a near term solution. But years down the road that increase won't be big enough. 
My take is we shouldn't just patch up the problem for now delaying a proper fix but  instead we should be adopting a solution that solves our problem today while addressing the problems in the future as well. This way in 4 years from now we won't have to have yet an other controversy over how the block size must be increased and segwit didn't do enough to fix the problem. By then it's not too unreasonable to think Bitcoin will be more decentralized, they'll be an even greater diversity in what software is run as a node and subsequently it will be even more difficult to create a fix for the block size issue than it is today.

It's Walmart Canada, if they can't pay by Visa and they don't have A MasterCard then customers will pay by Interac debit cards, which have transaction fees lower than the bitcoin network (I'm sure Interac is probably more expensive in the end though due to payment processor fees seeing how some Bitcoin payment processors like Bitpay charge no fee at all). 
@_date: 2017-08-09 00:02:48
You do realize though that if 90% of the hashrate does switch to Segwit2x and since this is scheduled to occur roughly halfway through the 2016  block difficulty adjustment window that the current Bitcoin chain with only 10% of the hashrate would see blocks take several hours to solve and that difficulty would take several months to readjust right? At that point the current chain kills it's self as miners and users further abandon it. At that point it's not really the creation of an alt, it is Bitcoin. 
That's why difficulty takes so long to adjust. To allow for a legacy chain to conceded to it'z successor in the event that miners come to the consensus that a different rule set is Bitcoin. 
The only way it creates a new coin is if hashrate is divided  in such a way that both coins have a fighting chance and this is unlikely to happen. It's more likely that if an absolute majority of the hashrate doesn't support Segwit2x that then miners will just back out of it all together and hashrates gets spread between current chain and BCash. 
@_date: 2017-08-05 19:55:45
The market will only get behind the fork if it's secured. That's what users will user. 
The NYA doesn't mean jack shit if 90% of miners *actually* get behind the chain and then the original chains block time goes up to 6 hours a block. What do you think users will use? POW is used to resolve consensus failures. Difficulty adjustments are wide between so that old chains die if hashrate doesn't get attracted to it. That's how Bitcoin is designed. 
If NYA signatories don't stick to their pledge then that's a whole different story.

The problem with segwit is it's only a temporary solution. Block size now is 1 MB. Segwit segregated block increases this to something that makes a Bitcoin block to be the equivalent of about 2-4 MB.
2 - 4 MB won't last us long. Even with something like the lightning network and segwit we're going to over time need to see Bitcoin with at least double digit megabyte block sizes for it to actually fix the problem.

It's not viable to have massive block sizes within the near future. 100 MB blocks would be 5 TB a year growth in the blockchain.
Sure maybe in the year 2150 that will be nothing but in the mean time it is. So double digit max in the near term is desirable. A dynamically increasing size over time would be best. But outright allowing triple digit block sizes any time soon would be destructive. Especially when things like the Lightning Network develop further to allow for capacity increases. 
@_date: 2017-08-08 01:50:57
Bitcoin can't scale as well onchain as off chain. But that doesn't change that Bitcoin can scale much more so onchain than it does currently and that the block limit as it stands is the only bottle neck from this happening.

That's not what Segwit2x is about. It's about keeping Bitcoin together. If it doesn't go through we see something like 40% of the hashrate that wants big blocks move to BCash and (hopefully) the rest use Bitcoin.
But with Segwit2x both sides make a compromise and miners both mine the same chain. Then BCash dies.

Correct if I'm wrong but as I understand it Bitcoin it's self though (outside of New York) isn't regulated. It's more just AML/KYC policies for exchanges  that are hard to comply with in the US and much of that is at a state by state level. As I understand it that's the issue. 
Sure Trump being in place could help further prevent an expansion of regulations on Bitcoin which would be a good thing. But what are the chances that a Republican congress (the guys always fear mongering about terrorists)  would be in favour of relaxing AML policies making it easier to enter the Bitcoin spaces even if they'd be friendly in other respects to Bitcoin?
On another note a deregulation of  banks could result in less confidence in the banks and then drive more and more people to alternative means of storing money like Bitcoin. So that would be a positive effect.

No its not. It's part of certain forms of socialism sure. But it's not the core of socialism. 
For example libertarian socialist take a view point that centralization is bad and strive for decentralized socialism.
 Socialism isn't an ideology about the state. It's an ideology about the workers. Some viewed that state as a means to put power into the hands of the workers others recognized the inevitable tyranny that would peruse and view the state ownership to be a threat the the workers. 
A society where every business is a co-op would be socialism  and decentralized. Market socialism would be  a decentralized economy not a centrally planned economy.

Well do you have the backup key? The purpose behind Green Address It is that there's 3 keys and 2 are needed to withdraw. Which means the key on your phone and their key. Or the key on your phone and your second key which can then be used to bypass Green Address entirely.  You hold two keys.
So that they won't give you the 2FA code shouldn't be a problem for you if you have your Green Address It properly set up because the system is designed so that they can't deprive you of your own funds. If you don't have a back up of your pair of keys then sorry buddy but Green Address It isn't the reason you lost you're Bitcoin, you are. Sorry you had to learn the hard way to always keep several backups of your Bitcoin.
Edit: They support 2 of 2 set ups and 2 of 3 setups. If you did 2 of 2 you should never have done that, now neither you nor them have control over the Bitcoin unless you can convince them you are who you say you are. If you had done 2 of 3 and kept backups you'd be fine. Always use 2 of 3 multisig wallets or else this happens.

It's not about if some miners mine it or not. It's about if enough miners mine it for the blocks not to take several hours to solve and difficulty several months to readjust.
If a minority of the hashrate forks then Bitcoin is unaffected.
If a large chunk (even a small majority) fork then the current chain survives both are given a fighting chance.
But if an absolute majority of the hashrate forks then the legacy chain has no chance of survival. 
That's just the way Bitcoin works. That's part of it's consensus rules. That's why we wait 2016 blocks for difficulty to readjust instead of doing it for more frequently.
People will abandon a dysfunctional chain. So will miners if it takes 6 hours to get a block reward on legacy but it takes 10 minutes to get a block reward on segwit2x which do you think miners will mine?
The only way the current chain survives is if a sufficient hashrate remains. But so far with 93% promising to mine Segwit2x that looks very unlikely. Remember Bitcoin cares not for what you and I think. It cares for what it's programmed to do and conceding to an absolute majority hard fork is part of what it's programmed to do.

3 months is plenty time to upgrade. 
Admittedly more time is probably best. But we need to take into account a couple of things. 
For starters, the amount code changed for a hard fork to 2 MB is relatively  minimal compared to core. 
Secondly its not 3 months. It's 3 months from the time of the release of the RC expected to be slated as stable. The code it's self has been being worked on longer than 3 months. 
Thirdly. The whole point of Segwit2x isn't to dethrone core. It's was prevent a UASF chainsplit to activate Segwit and to prevent a BU fork for unlimited block size. Getting 2X miners to support the Segwit chain means they'll only do so in expectation that it'll also be a bigger block chain. Bypassing the hyper conservative development practices of core (which are usually justifiable) was necessary to achieve consensus. An unwillingness to fork because of this  is a reason why some devs had left core.

Miners can't turn off BIP91 it's already locked in. So a BIP91 node and a BIP148 node today effectively do the same thing, just that the BIP91 node has been doing it prior to the BIP148 node. I also don't want to supper the guerilla tactic of UASF but would much rather put my support behind a properly thought out MASF just as a matter of principle of not resorting to sybil attacks because others don't agree with me.

It's contentious among some users yes. But not among the network and it's consensus rules. Bitcoin is designed in such a way that it concedes to a hard fork in the event that you see something like 90% of the hashrate fork. Bitcoin doesn't care for what you and I think. It's autonomous remember and proof of work is used to resolve consensus failures.

There's some valid points there which admittedly I was mostly aware of. But this one here I couldn't help but to laugh. 


The capacity doubling of Segwit isn't anything near "extreme". Not only is it a capacity increase literally needed to facilitate growth, nodes can handle it, the network can handle it and so forth. It's really not that large of an increase. This is further proved by the spam attack that recently went on on BCH that handled 8MB blocks without issue.
It's worth noting that Gregory Maxwell (which wrote that post you linked to in addition to being a core dev is also [the CTO of Blockstream]( which due to it's sidechains products stands to profit off very small blocks. So he as a key member stands to personally benefit off small blocks. So don't expect to get an unbiased take on this.
It is for reasons like this that people and money are being driving to other dev teams whether it be BCH or Segwit2x.
suggests I'll get censored for a post like this, I believe I won't suggesting I would is just FUD. Let's find out.

That's not exactly how things work. If there was a smooth transition, if 2x started off small then sure the market would find an equilibrium and it'd be more or less like you say.
But if all of a sudden 93% hard fork at block 494784 and exchanges list Bitcoin as the fork then that's a much different dynamic.

Nodes decide the rules of a blockchain yes. But miners decided whether the rules of a node's blockchain will be secured. This is how Bitcoin  protects against sybil attack. One actor can't just spring up a bunch of nodes to change consensus rules and overwhelm the rest. Proof of work is used to make it so large amounts of resources are needed. 
BCash doesn't have the hashrate necessary to secure its self and is little different from the average Joe making  a fork of their own. So yes it's a fork doomed to fail. Developers knew this which they which why they needed to refine difficulty rules. 
However in the event that the absolute majority of the hashrate switched to a fork (eg should Segwit2x go through with the 90% of hashrate pledged to support it, or some other hypothetical) then this means that the difficulty of the current chain (core/legacy chain if you will) will retain the same difficulty of today but have severely less hashrate. Meaning blocks will take hours to solve. In essence Bitcoin's current consensus rules declare this chain dead as its no longer viable to mine, transact on, or use. Why else do you think it takes 2016 blocks between difficulty adjustments and not way sooner? 
Bitcoin's own consensus rules basically police it's own death and concede if an other chain attracts nearly all its hashrate. As you said nodes define and police and in doing so they can most certainly do their part to enforce that they are taking over by a different set of nodes. 


You say this as if I don't understand. But you're the one that doesn't seem to understand much about the delicate balance between miners and nodes and how they both play a role in keeping each other  in check. Bitcoin's system of checks and balances if you will. 
@_date: 2017-08-11 07:14:42
Nah Segwit2x is a whole different story. BCH doesn't earn as much because it's a minority fork. Miners don't care for it the market doesn't much either. 
But if Segwit2x goes through it'll be a majority fork. Current signaling is 93% so this means not only will it fork it'll do so with so much hashrate so abruptly that it'll actually kill off the legacy chain. The legacy chain will take several hours to solve blocks while Segwit2x only takes 10 min. So the Segwit2x chain become Bitcoin and the old chain will be less profitable and quite literally doomed to die with several hour long blocks.

That's not why BitPay exists. They're a payment processor. They make it easy for developers/merchants to integrate Bitcoin payments and into their applications and facilitate the automatic sale of Bitcoin to fiat while for transfer to a merchants bank account. 
With LN couldn't BitPay also easily become a payment channel themselves and collect a fee from this? 
Any business can run their own full node if they choose that includes with onchain  scaling. A 1TB hard drive is pretty cheap these days, and pretty much a standard. Any business thy won't run a full node aren't running one already. So nothing will change there. The purpose of BitPay isn't so you can use their node to find a balance. There's countless other nodes out there for that. 
It should also be noted BitPay is publicly in favor of LN and off chain scaling.

@_date: 2017-08-03 03:05:30
Nah. That's not the issue. That it's backwards compatible is the only reason that there is wipeout risk. Allow me to explain. 
BIP148 rejects all blocks that don't signal Segwit after August 1st. This means that if the majority of the hashrate signals Segwit there's no issue. Both BIP148 and core nodes fallow the same chain because the longest chain wins and the longest chain is the BIP148 chain, so there's no risk of a chain  split. 
The problem occurs in that if Segwit has a minority of the hashrate then BIP148 still rejects blocks that don't signal for Segwit. Core nodes however accept blocks that don't signal for Segwit. So what happens is the chain splits. 
Now what happens is we could see the BIP148 chain have a minority of the hashrate for say a week. All the while this means a separate chain is being used by core nodes. For the period of this week two chains exist that have forked and have a separate record of transactions. 
Now if miners shift their hashrate to the  BIP148 chain then it could become the majority chain. This means means that eventually its block height would surpass that of the core chain. At which point since its a soft fork and its blocks are compatible with core, and since core will fallow the longest chain then what happens is core nodes ditch the chain they were propagating a week ago and start fallowing the BIP148 chain. This means that all of a sudden the weeks transactions before hand get wipe out as they didn't exist in the now longest BIP148 chain. This is what we call wipeout. That's why exchanges disabled Bitcoin transactions prior to BIP148 activating. 
By contract BCash is a UAHF so core nodes can't fallow the BCash chain if they want. So in the (albeit extremely unlikely) scenario that the BCash chain gained majority hashrate it wouldn't wipeout the Bitcoin chain and its transactions since the fork because the BCash chain is not backwards compatible with Core nodes. So both blockchains would continue to be able to co-exist peacefully without wiping out any record of transactions on the other. This is why BCash is referred to as having wipeout protection because it can't wipe out any transactions currently fallowed by Core. 
This is why BIP148 is extremely naive and why I referred to it as a guerilla tactic.  BIP91 is a much better more properly thought out approach to activate Segwit because it says only reject blocks that don't signal Segwit if the absolute majority of the hashrate supports doing so. This means  that non Segwit blocks are only rejected if it's guaranteed that it will remain the longest chain. Therefore no transactions fallowed by core would be wiped out. 
@_date: 2017-08-11 05:34:44
Segwit2x still gets to achieve unity. The only reason why BCH sits around at about 6% of the hashrate of BTC is because the hashrate is united under the NYA so they're mining BTC. If Segwit2x falls apart you sure won't see BCH with a laughable hashrate. It'll increase.

Segwit2x hard forks at block 494,784 this means it forks 864 blocks into the 2016 block readjustment window. Meaning 1152 blocks must be solved to retarget difficulty. 
At 10% of the hashrate blocks will take a little over an hour and a half to solve. Meaning they'll stay that long for the period of 2-3 month before retarget block is hit. 
Are you telling me that you're in denial of that? Or do you believe that during that time frame 10% of the hashrate will stay loyal to that chain and users won't ditch it (further giving incentive to miners to ditch it) over that time span?
Yes it's certainly possible that a bunch of miners back out of 2x but that's not what this thread is about. 
So if we're assuming only 10% (or as it stands 7%) remain then that means that you have to believe that for those 3+ months the current chain won't be abandoned with increasing block times (as more miners are likely to ditch it during that period of time along with users) and will hold on strong?
Because otherwise what happens if 1x chain is to stay alive then  a hard fork is required to reduce difficulty. In which case from your own point of view Bitcoin no longer exists.

You should wait. Bitcoin Cash doesn't actually exist yet. The fork hasn't taken place. The nodes have started rejecting BTC blocks but the BCH miners haven't yet mined a block of their own. 
That said at least in theory you'd be fine as BitcoinABC has started rejecting new BTC blocks so as long as your balance was in the last Bitcoin core block before nodes started rejecting then you'd own Bitcoin Cash. But there's technically a risk that a miner builds their first Bitcoin Cash block from a newer Bitcoin Core block than that of which other nodes have been rejecting. 
So you should play it safe and wait until at least one Bitcoin Cash block is mined and preferably a couple of them (due to risk of reorganization). 
Edit: better clarification.

Yes it can, because if all the miners support Segwit2x then the 1x chain dies because difficulty is super high but hashrate drops to next to nothing blocks take several hours to solve and difficulty several months to readjust. 
This is the reality of the situation. Bitcoin's own consensus rules declare the previous chain dead if an other chain succeeds it. This is how Bitcoin. The chain with the most proof of work wins the others die. That's how Bitcoin resolves consensus failure.
The market will not get behind a chain that does not have the hashrate required to secure its self and that half block times of several hours rather than 10 min.

Do like me diversify and buy both. Stocks have the benefit of more variety and it's easy to find ETFs that will out pace inflation and be less volatile than Bitcoin. Of course some stocks at times will outperform Bitcoin (like Nvidia and Canopy Growth Corp have over the last year).  
The benefit up diversification with Bitcoin is should the stock market crash we'd expect Bitcoin to increase in value as a result (much like how gold would). The benefit to Bitcoin though is compared to gold is that Bitcoin may go up even when the stock market is (where as with gold stocks go up gold usually goes down). 
The thing about stocks is while there are small cap stocks that outperform Bitcoin at times these stocks do so temporarily Bitcoin I'd anticipate be something that will make large returns for decades  to come. 
But if all you want is to save yourself from inflation and not far out pace it then any broadly diversified portfolio with bulk in big cap stocks will achieve this.

Payment channels and side chains are two different things. With side chains you lock up funds on thy Bitcoin blockchain and then transact them on a parallel blockchain and when it's desired the funds on Bitcoin can be unlocked and given to who ever they were transfered through on the side chains. 
With payment channels its not exactly a parallel blockchain. It can be a central entity allowing for fast rapid transactions but because its backed by multi-sig on chain transactions then the entity can't stall your funds. Transactions can then go back and forth off chain and the sum of these transactions get settled on chain. 
Here's a good explanation of Lightning.

Segwit doesn't give them unlimited block size it increases it to a max of about 4x in theory but in practical terms it doubles the block (well it actually creates a separate block and keeps current one same size but it's as if double it). 
Also miners don't want big block size. They want small block size because then users need to pay higher transaction fees for their transactions to go through. Even with a hard cap block increase don't expect miners to increase the block size until to it's max until it's required. Miners already can control their block size. The 1 Mb block is just a maximum. 
I still fail to see how a bigger block would give miners more power.

They might be moving it to the exchange to then withdraw at a later point (possibly as an alt coin too) so that they can tumble it. This is a lot of Bitcoin they can't just send it to one coin mixer and expect to wash the transaction history, they'll get some of their original coins back. Plus using a bitcoin mixing service has high fees (2-3% usually). Where as sending to a shared wallet and withdrawing (basically what an exchange is) allows for half decent mixing without the high fees of a mixing service. If they exchange any for altcoins and then withdraw it further obscures their movements as it then happens on a different blockchain which they can then use to transfer to an other exchange and then buy back a different set of Bitcoin (this sort of off chain transaction by using multiple different block chains makes it harder to trace their movements). 
So they could be looking to dump the coins but they'd have to be pretty stupid to sell millions of dollars worth of obviously stolen money and transfer it into a bank account (given KYC and all). So I'd place my bets on them looking to wash the coins through exchanges.

This shouldn't be a problem though as the Segwit2x chain will kill off the Segwit1x since 93% of the hashrate will jump ships to the 2x chain. 
If miners back out of the agreement then they aren't unified under one chain so big blockers would likely go off to Bitcoin Cash while Segwiters stick with current chain. 
If only a small minority of hashrate  backs Segwit2x the it'll kill it's self as it doesn't have the difficulty reduction rules of Bitcoin Cash.

Exactly. We live in an age of 1 TB hard drive and 8 thread CPUs. The advancements in underlying hardware will only continue to develop and outpace the growth of the blockchain making more node resources viable. Quite frankly nodes take up very little resources right now.
@_date: 2017-08-18 22:23:17
Nodes fallow the longest chain in the event of a soft fork or chain split. In the event of a hard fork they fallow what ever matches their rule set. Without long difficulty readjustment windows minority chains can certain survive. Just look at how BCH as a result of changing the difficulty rules has successfully survived for the time being as a minority chain.

The purpose of Bitcoin isn't to issue Bitcoin. It's to have a decentralized trustless ledger. In order to do this we need miners and miners need a financial incentive. So they we reward them with newly mined Bitcoin to give them the incentive to secure the ledger. 
Do you even understand how Lightning works? Yes transactions can be done on other layers
 but people only do so knowing that they have the backing of being able to be redeemed on chain for Bitcoin. 
It's basically saying I'm going to lock up my Bitcoin for IOUs transact these more easily and them redeem the IOUs. If you can't redeem the IOUs for Bitcoin then you no longer are transacting Bitcoin. At that point it's not much different from post gold standard fiat. 
In addition to needing the blockchain to settle on chain what was transacted off chain we also need the blockchain to broadcast the initial lock up of funds on chain so that they can be transacted off chain.

Considering that 2x is designed as an upgrade to the protocol and to replace the current chain, or not occur at all if it doesn't have the hashrate required to do so. Then why would replay protection be needed if the 1x chain dies (which it will if 90% of the hashrate gets behind 2x as it is currently signaling).

Agreed (in terms of consensus anyways). But Core sure seems to disagree, at least some of their prominent devs do.
@_date: 2017-08-01 16:53:44
To be expected. With current hashrate that it has expected block time to be about 6 hours. Then after 6 blocks are mined it starts reducing difficulty so that it doesn't just die and then block time will fall closer in line.

Nah nodes never voted on features. Only miners (as well as blocks for that matter). Otherwise the network would be vulnerable to sybil attack.
Nodes do enforce their own rule set though and not allowing nodes those disagree with those rules from talking to them can be one of those.

@_date: 2017-08-08 01:37:18
But at the end of the day the chain with the most proof of work wins. So therefore miners have the final say as to what rule set wins. This is especially true for soft forks and what chain older nodes will fallow.
Even though it can be activated without miners, miner cooperation is needed. Isn't this why miner activated forks are preferred because otherwise not enough miners may support it for it to be viable in the end?

That's like saying weed is banned because I can get arrested with it. Thing is its as plentiful to buy in the streets as ever due to popular demand. 
Would people in the west buy Bitcoin in this manner if it was illegal. Probably not because the demand for money would go towards fiat. However in countries where the national currency sucks and it's already banned then it does already get sold in the street. It does have demand because the fiat alternative isn't a viable option. So that depends on circumstance.

They're just implementing their security policy.


They don't want a hacker or someone pretending to be you trying to reset 2FA. It's the responsibly of the user to keep backups of their 2FA codes. Additionally if OP has the 2 of 3 multi-sig wallet (and not the 2 of 2 one) then you can bypass Green Address It and use both your backup keys to transfer the funds without Green Address It being required for approval (2FA). That's the whole point behind their service. 
If anything perhaps they should make this policy clear and make the importants of back ups apparent to their users.

Yes I know what the difference is between a hard fork and I'm as happy to shit on BCH as you. 
But if 90% of miners actually are in favor of a hard fork (like they signal with  Segwit2x intent). Then I don't see how that's that much different than 100% doing so. Sure it'll create two chains but the market will get behind the one that's secure in addition to attract miners to secure one or the other if its in their economic incentive. Then consensus resolves it's self because one chain will die off from market forces and the other survive. Consensus resolves its self.
I wasn't aware of other ways to increase block size (in practice) further than with BIP141 through the use of soft forks. That's good to know and may be preferable depending on the pros/cons of it  (outside of the whole soft vs hard fork debate).

A 2 MB block size isn't going to cause the sky to fall. We need onchain scaling that's just a reality. It's a legitimate concern to have unlimited block size because yes eventually nodes drop off the network and are too hard to run so it leads to centralization. 
But it's pretty standard to have 1TB + hard drives these days. So don't pretend that we can't cope with Segwit2x blocks of 2 MB + Segwit equaling about 8 MB effectively. 
Small block sizes lead to centralization too because onchain transactions become too expensive and so all transactions would need to be done off chain. For Bitcoin through Lightning to remain decentralized for example we need to be able to have payment channels settle on chain every now and then. If it's too hard to settle on chain then people won't and we basically wind up trading around centralized IOUs for Bitcoin all the time. 
Segwit2x gives us the good balance between keeping block sizes small enough to run nodes and allowing you to settle on chain.

Hard forking a $50 billion blockchain to upgrade it isn't something you do over. No it needs rigorous testing so of course you don't do it now.  It's not about a pump and dump of instant  money, it's about a protocol upgrade. That's why we wait 3 months because software is still in an RC and testing is needed. This is the same reason many people feel the 3 month time span is far too short. 
It's not China coin that's BCH. You do realize that signatories such like Coinbase, BitFury, BitPay and the guy who put this all together being Barry Silbert are all Americans too right?

BCH doesn't have Segwit, that was a point of it, a protest by some against Segwit who believe the FUD about Segwit.

They did implement a difficulty decrease rule where if 6 blocks take more than 12 hours to solve then difficulty is reduced by 20%. It doesn't make sense to outright the difficulty rules to make it severely dynamic. Difficulty takes time to adjust for a reason. It's a security feature so that chains without enough hashrate die off. There's a chance that BCH will even be one of such chain. It's unreasonable to make difficulty decrease too aggressive.

With Bitfinex, Kraken, and Bitrex, also OKEx/OkCoin if you had Bitcoin in the exchange prior to the fork then you were rewarded Bitcoin Cash for those Bitcoin. You can then sell them. In fact I actually sold half my Bitcoin Cash prior to the fork on OKEx as they were trading futures and I withdrew the proceeds of that sale prior to the fork. 
Basically plenty of people thought this through and knew that sending Bitcoin Cash from their own wallets to an exchange to dump right away was going to be next to impossible. So they made sure they'd have their Bitcoin Cash in the exchange before hand ready to sell right now.

That doesn't matter.
 If your suggesting that the difference in number of nodes between the two concepts matters it doesn't, node count isn't a democracy we can't do that because of this thing called a Sybil attack. That's why we have miners, because nodes can't be trusted not to lie about the order of  transactions. 
Secondly 150 nodes is plenty enough for the network to function. Absolutely more should be used for the sake of decentralization but more will be up on the run up to the fork and after it. For example there were only about 150 BitcoinABC nodes before the BCH fork also, soon after it rose to where they are today at over 800.
Additionally since a hard for of the magnitude of Segwit2x means 93% of hashrate leaving then the core chain will kill its self due to difficulty causing blocks to take several hours to solve. So those 6000 running core nodes now will wind up ditching that chain and start running Segwit2x nodes.

It's unlikely that any of the nodes up are fake as they'd be real up and running nodes. They only thing you can really define as fake is if they display a user agent of a node different than theirs. 
So if by fake you mean are they individuals with each 1 node or could there be say 5000 nodes each controlled by one person and 1000 nodes all controlled by one individual? If that's the case then you can absolutely have "fake" nodes that are will connected and up running for long periods of time. In fact that can be said about faking a user agent too.

Yeah that's better security. If you generate it from a live CD on a computer not connected to the internet then it's cold storage. 
Of course if all your USB keys are in your house and your house burns down your out of luck. But if you had a backup on Google Drive you would be okay. 
I don't see much problem with putting it on Google Drive myself so long as it's double encrypted. Sure it's less secure than other means but it's a place you don't need to worry about it disappearing. 
What I mean by double encrypted is like you suggest with 7 zip. If you put the wallet up there it's self the Bitcoin will be encrypted but your addresses won't. So an attacker would know it's Bitcoin and how much and then meet try and crack it. But if you wrap that in an encrypted archive and then call it something like "backup123" then the contents is hidden and corrupt sys admins won't have an incentive to try and crack it to get the Bitcoin.

In Canada I can do an EFT online for free to transfer between my accounts. Most banks won't let you do that online but I'm sure they'd let you at the bank and EFT's are free. Their just as slow as though as ACH though I think and typically take 2-3 days. 
But at least we got Interac in Canada, it's the only part of the financial payment network in Canada that is actually world leading rather than just legacy (like EFTs).  As an Interac etransfer is instants. As are debit card payment/deposits. Unlike on Visa or MC where it takes 2 days or so Interac is instant. Both of those cases Interac is no hold. Also my Tangerine account let's me deposit a cheque for up to $1 million. I won't get that all without hold obviously, and I'll never have to deposit something that big. But being able to and getting a few grand right away without hold is much different than OP's bank.
Also I'm pretty sure other countries use the term EFT outside of just Canada too. The US technically have EFT's too but they just prefer to call them ACH or echecks. But in Canada and some other countries EFT is the day to day term for it.

BCash doesn't have the needed support of miners. It only has about 5% of the hashrate of Bitcoin give or take, and chances are much of that is so miners can dump their stash of BCash.

Yeah it is, 12,960 blocks after Segwit activation is the BTC1 rules. So I don't know what this article is getting at.

It's not spam. It's just that if you rely entirely on nodes then the network is susceptible to sibyl attack because anyone can spring up a bunch of nodes will little resources. That's why POW is needed to prevent sibyl attack as large resources must be used. That's why we trust miners to confirm transactions, because we can't trust nodes to do so.

I get that and I understand that more capacity can't be achieved just through bigger blocks. Blocks can't be huge. My point is though even with more capacity achieved outside of block size increases the backbone for this is inevitably the blockchain so blocks need to be large enough to accommodate what is built on top of them. Even if 99% of transactions were done through payment channels the 1% that aren't need the blockchain. Now as demand for Bitcoin increases that 1% that must fit in a block increases.

Doesn't change much. It was never banned to mine in Quebec. They just put a halt to new large scale (Megawatt territory) mining farms until they figured out a management plan. Any small and medium scale operations they were fine with as they don't have any out of the ordinary electrical setups.
@_date: 2017-08-02 04:54:57
It's not so much what the difficulty is. It's about what the hashrate is relative so the hardware out there and the hashrate distribution across different pools. 
With BCH having about 3% of what was BTC hashrate and only two pools mining it (to the best of my knowledge) then this means that there's a high risk that one powerful actor could manage amass a separate 3% and do a 51% attack (or even 1.5% and attack in a 33% manner). Additionally with only two pools and one having majority hashrate then there's high risk that that pool (as it stands ViaBTC) could manipulate blocks or collude with Bitcoin.com (the other pool) to control basically the entire chain's hashrate.

You can't tell much by a picture. We need to see the video. All that is said in OPs post is that a fork is possible and Bitcoin is getting an upgrade. One can view Segwit, Segwit2x, and Bitcoin Cash all as an update of sorts. Saying that a fork is going on and an update is occurring does not necessarily mean support is expressed for either one of these. Without further information this amounts merely to a matter of seeing what you want to see.

UASF nodes pretty much did the same thing as BIP91 nodes. BIP91 is much better and prevented a chain split.
But the guerrilla tactics of UASF did accomplish something and that is to have BIP91 beat UASF to it's job and prevent the chainsplit possible under UASF. So in a sense UASF didn't do much directly (and I'd have to say it's a BIP148 was a reckless approach too). But the threat that it could happen did play a major role in the Segwit part of 2X happening now.

Quebec is a province not a provision. There was never a ban (just a moratorium on new huge scale farms), and it was never a government imposed moratorium (no law passed) just a decision from the hydro electric utility to come up with a management plan.


It was never illegal for miners to operate in Quebec. The electrical utility just refused to hook up warehouses with several megawatts worth of electricity. Any small to medium size facility doesn't need dedicated lines and would just be hooked up with those in the neighborhood.

Easy to reject? Ha. Going up against 90% of the hashrate isn't easy to reject. If people want Bitcoin to somehow stick around with small blocks you do realize that this will require a hard fork of its own right? Because at that point the legacy chain will die from the difficulty rendering current nodes useless regardless of your views. At that point why bother? 2MB blocks aren't going to cause the sky to fall. 
@_date: 2017-08-01 00:47:34
Segwit2x is not an attack. It's a fork that over 88% of miners have agreed too (looking at 24h NYA signaling intention of mined blocks). If they adhere to that agreement then it effectively becomes the new network. 
They haven't abandoned X2 for Bitcoin Cash, rather quite the contrary. Bitmain has said that Bitcoin Cash will only have their backing if Segwit2x doesn't go through. If Segwit2x does go through then they'll support it only and Bitcoin Cash will likely die. BCash's only chance of survival is if Segwit2x doesn't go through.

So both sides made a compromise, both sides get what they want and 90% managed to get behind this. Consensus crisis adverted.

Nope gov didn't put a hold on it. Hydro Quebec put a hold on it the premiere just made a comment. People conflate these two because Hydro Quebec is state owned.
Hydro Quebec is pro mining but the CEO said his phone was rigging off the hook with requests from people around the world looking to set up mining farms requiring several mega watts in Quebec and they didn't have the resources to meet those demands. The CEO said he wants miners but we can't host the world (and the world wants in). So he decided to halt new large scale mines until they could come up with a risk management plan.
It costs them millions of dollars to run new distribution lines to supply a warehouse with the electricity of a small cities. So they wanted to figure out a plan to seek out only the best miners (those with the lowest risk and highest economic benifit) and to evaluate the rate given to miners.

Bitcoin doesn't have political goals. It's math it's goals are only to validate transactions and do so in 10 minute block times. Many Bitcoin users may have political objectives and view Bitcoin as a means to help achieve it but even then many people of opposing political positions may view Bitcoin as a means of achieving they're goals. Bitcoin can be politically favourable to a libertarian (as we most commonly see) but can also just as easily in an entirely different light be viewed as a means of further aiding the political objectives  of a Liberal, socialist, or a communists. Yet few people seem to realize this.

Even they can't do it. It's likely not possible for a decentralized network to ever compete with a centralized one in terms of trades per second that can be executed. With Bitcoin a trade needs to propagate across the entire world and then be verified cryptographically. With the a centralized exchange you can have the entire network operate in one room where each server communicates with each other over gigabit LAN with a ping time less than a millisecond that doesn't need cryptography to verify the trustworthiness of the trade because it's centralized do the network only needs to trust it's self. Which is exactly why for blockchain trading in the future we'll be using centralized trade engine to match buyer and seller and then once trade us executed offload the value of it onto the blockchain to transaction. Much like we currently do where trades occur in real time on Bitstamp and users then withdraw the transact  on the blockchain to hold the asset independent of a central authority. It's reasonable to wait a few hundred milliseconds for a transaction to propagate when buying a coffee. It's not when pairing a trade amongst millions of users.

I don't know, I'm sure some are. The thing about not Bitcoin friendly banks are typically the big banks. The thing about direct banks is they can operate out of just a headquarters and to the end user be just a website. This means there's a lot more competition. For example I'm in Canada, there are 5 big banks, some times referred to as 6 (the 6th largest being largest in my area). So while there are 3 banks in my town and about 6-7 within the greater region of the city accessible to me. But add in direct banks and there's about 20 banks available. Some only offer savings but it's still a number of banks and credit unions. In the US you'll find more even direct banking competition as well (just more banks in general). 
So you can avoid big banks that might hate Bitcoin. But even if they aren't Bitcoin friendly and they shut down your account, well just go to an other bank. There's a handful to choose from. 
 The brick and mortar banking market is largely an oligopoly. But the moment you add in direct banks there is an abundantly competitive banking industry. So coming by banks that like Bitcoin should be easier for direct banking. Also if you look at Fidor (a German direct bank) they are pro Bitcoin and are partnered  with Bitcoin.de, I think they've expanded to UK last I heard and they might move onto other markets including US. So we'll see.

My bank will currier deliver cashier checks to me if I need. Those aren't free but I never use them so that's not an issue for me.
As for ATM's that varies based on country and bank but you will have ATM access. 
In Canada the way it works out is the two major direct banks for chequing accounts are subsidiaries of big banks so they give you full access to their parent companies ATM network for free deposit/withdrawal. The other two use a network of partnered banks and credit unions that let you use any member ATM in that network to deposit/withdraw for free. 
In the US it's a bit different for better or for worst. In America you won't find a direct bank that let's you deposit cash at an ATM (you can deposit checks by taking a picture of them with your no problem). Instead in the US there are two approaches, a partnered network that let's you access money for free one eligible ATM's which are across the country (but still no cash deposits for some reason) AFAIK this is how CapitolOne360 work), or the preffered one where you can use any ATM in the  country for free because the bank reimburses you the ATM fees effectively making all ATM's nation wide free. Ally and Bank of Internet (look into their rewards checking)  do this domestically. Charles Schwab even refunds international ATM fees. 
As for other countries not sure how it will work out but direct banks will have deals in place so you can use ATM's to access your cash.

They're a bank they run a fractional reserve like all other banks. They can make massive  amounts of money off of you without charge a dime. It's not like there's never any fee anywhere but for day to day banking it's free and for most customers this means they'll pay no fees at all. If there's an area where there is a fee it's just about always less than the big banks. I've literally paid $5 buck to my bank over the duration  that I've been a customer for instant Interbank  email transfers (internal email transfers  or the slow ones are free) and they've paid me far more primarily from no catch promotional bonuses and I have no monthly fees or day to day banking fees. So for my needs yes it's and it wouldn't be if I was at a big bank. 
The business model of a direct bank is that tellers and branch staff costs lots of money. So by being online only we no longer pay them. As a result of this it means massive savings for the bank. It also means they can be more wide spread. The Internet is international, laws aren't but direct banks are typically only restricted to the confines of federal law. This means that all it takes for a bank to compete nationally is one head quartets  in one city only. Subsequently the banks pass on savings to you in a very competitive market. So yes it is available just about everywhere. In much of the Europe and in Australia there's ING Direct, in Canada there's Tangerine, PC Financial, Canadian Direct Financial. In Germany Fidor is also available. In the US Ally, CapitolOne360,  Charles Schwab, Bank of Internet to name a few. These are all banks available nation wide. Meanwhile people are still off sitting in one town thinking Bank of America and their shitty interest rate of 0.03% of a fee ridden savings account is their only option meanwhile you could get 1% interest in deposits for no fees from Synchrony Bank anywhere in the country and every direct banks chequing account pays more interest that BOAs savings account. 
It's not that direct banks are too good to be true. It's that big banks are so horrible they  make direct banks look amazingly cheep. 
You know how I signed up for my bank? I went to the website pit in some info and set up the account, then I logged into the on my phone and deposited a cheque that I write out to my self from my previous bank for my internal deposit by taking a picture of the front and back. Then in a few days my debit card comes in the mail and all is good. This could of been done by anyone anywhere in the country meanwhile they thought there was only a few banks around. No, there's a lot of banking competition, I don't need to live near a bank to be it's customer, we have the Internet to interact.

Still you are better off with direct banks. In the UK interest rates are high compared to North America and much of Europe. Though inflation is higher in UK. Still you can get [5% on deposits bellow £2000 from TBS]( First Direct [will pay up to 6%]( I don't really understand the context of your banking system so I don't know if these accounts fit your needs.  But they're a decent rate. [Santander has a current account that pays 3%]( First Direct is a direct bank don't know about how TBS one works out. 
This is vastly different than the US where big banks typically pay 0.03% to 0.2%,  0.3-0.5% at most (highest in the country though is about 1%). In Canada big banks are roughly 1% (little lower now due to low key interest rate at  the BOC). So even what this banks offer sounds decent.

Btc-e has EUR and RUR so they aren't impacted much by not being able to process USD withdrawals as they can still withdraw fiat.
As for OKCoin I suspect what's up is that OKCoin was going for a discount probably because OKCoin China had disabled Bitcoin withdrawals because of the PBOC. While this doesn't affect OKCoin International that had functioning USD withdrawals it likely has lead to speculation that Chinese officials may go after OKCoin International. Now that OKCoin International can't withdraw USD this drives up prices. This counteracts each other and OKCoin starts to trade roughly at Bitstamp price.

SSL is broken simply because of it's reliance on CAs to validate domains which is entirely centralized and continues to exist as issuing of certificates is a profitable industry changeling fees for really just digital signatures.
The ideal way I know of to solve this problem and make the network trustless is well, the blockchain. Through the use of Namecoin DNS records can be stored decentralized absent the need of trust in root servers, then necessary signatures to validate certificates can be embedded directly within the DNS records. DNSSEC would need to be used to validate the DNS records to be legit. Then since using a regular recursive DNS server access this would be a security vulnerability as trust would be needed in it. So you'd have to run a Namecoin node on your home network and have all devices preform DNS queries over your LAN directly too it. Although I suppose you could use a third parties recursive DNS server so long as it relays DNSSEC info and your clients (or LAN cache on router) can then validate the signatures therefore speeding up DNS queries. Now no need for a trusted third party as a network is used that requires no trust in order to function. We'd still be able to use TLS just the same but would change the flawed part which is the need of trust in a third party to validate certificates.

Conexxus Credit Union is an American credit union that operates as a direct bank. But for the most part actual direct banks offer better service and rates than them in most circumstances.
 Chase is a joke, every direct bank in America pays more than Chase's savings account on their chequeing accounts. For savings check out Synchrony Bank they'll be the best option for savings and highest rate in the country last a checked. 
For checking CapitolOne360 is best for overdrafts. Their they charge no fees for overdraft only interest. Compared to Chase this means you could save several hundred dollars in fees and pay roughly nothing  if you went over for a little bit. 
Outside of overdrafts though you'll find better checking than CapitolOne360. Ally, Bank of Internet, Charles Schwab, and Everbank are some notable names. Bank of Internet is great for rewards checking which had interest that scales up depending on what your activity is. Maybe you'd want a local credit union for cash deposits. 
You can look at bankrate.com, it's an along site. They will let you compare rates across all banks direct or traditional that are available in your area or nationally. They list just about all banks. If I recall right Bank of Internet is the only one I don't think they listed. But they're great for shopping around for different rates and banks.

Bitmain is in the business of making money. They want to make a bunch off miner fees and are happy to see a greater centralization of mining that may come from BU. They clearly don't care that Segwit is good for the market as a whole and will increase the price of the Bitcoin they mine.

Fiscal responsibility has nothing to do with left or right. A welfare state does work and people actually pay for things through their taxes. What doesn't work is wanting to give everyone money and not pay for it then you get the fiscally irresponsible left which is just as bad as the fiscally irresponsible right that refuses to raise taxes and always wants to cut them but then can't balance a budget because they have too little tax revenue to finance existing costs or service existing debt. The fiscally responsible left pay for what they use and the fiscally responsible right don't pay for what they use and social democracy works so well in Scandinavia because there people are actually comfortable paying high enough taxes to finance their programs.

You should be fine to visit it through TOR initially so long it's https so that then an exit node can't alter the contents of the page. I take it you didn't type in the https part though and just typed in bitmixer.io which means that if https everywhere doesn't have this site in it's list of compatible sites and bitmixer doesn't have HSTS preloading in TOR then the http request was attacked before it could be redirected to the https version.

Nope http and https are two different listening ports on the server. Http being port 80 and https port 443. This means if a site admin truly desires (not that they would) could have a different site served over http than the https version. 
 Ideally a server enforcing https will be set up to have no page render for the http request and will then preform a 301 redirect (http status code for url permanently moved update all links) to the https url with requested file path. This is why when you type in a url absent the https part if the site enforces https then it will automatically redirect your http request. The issue here is that if you visited a malicious server the redirect would never happen and you'd be attacked in http.
The solution to this is adding a HSTS header to the https site. This adds a super cookie of sorts to your browser for a set period of time (usually 6 months to a year) that tells the browser to automatically always use the https version for that URL even if the http version is requested. This solves the ability to attack the initial http request by preventing said request in the first place. The problem with HSTS however is that before the browser can save it it must have made the http request initially and be redirected. This opens up the user to attack especially more so in TOR as the use of private browsing means that HSTS is removed after each session. So it is only valid for said session. 
To solve this problem HSTS preloading has been implemented in browsers. This is a white list that contains a list of sites to always use HSTS for without having to preform the initial http request (should a user not preform a https request to start with). Thing is a site must be added to these lists by its admins and browser must support said list and be updated to have newest whitelist. 
Https everywhere (which TOR includes by default) performs HSTS like functionality for sites that don't support it and are in HTTPS Everywhere whitelist. In addition to this it's function  is to force https on sites that do not enforce it and allow users to use either http or https. 
Edit: Bitmixer.io does not support HSTS at all although it does preform a redirect from http to https as explained above this isn't helpful should the http request be man in the middled. So add it to your HTTPS whitelist to prevent http requests.

If inflation is too high it kills the currency. But many economists would agree that a low rate of inflation is a good thing as influx of newly created money can be used to put people to work and so forth that otherwise wouldn't be. This is why when the economy does bad central banks decrease their interest rates so more money can be borrowed from them by commercial banks that is then lent out at rates far below what could be achieved if new money couldn't be printed (as no inflation means high interest rates). The low interest rates can then mean more investment more infrastructure spending, more new business and startups, and so forth and put people to work. Said debt can then be leveraged to grow the economy. Then as economies strengthen  central banks will increase interest rates to curb inflation. 
Some would also say that inflation encourages spending and investing rather than holding the currency, but really that's more secondary. Basically you got two option high interest rates and no inflation, or an acceptable amount of inflation and low interest rates.

In my province daycare costs $7.50 a day (CAD) as it's subsidized. You know why we keep doing it? Because the government actually makes more back in tax revenue from this expenditure than it spends on it. Although not much gain a gain none the less. The reason? More women are able to go to work by putting their kids in cheap day care rather than staying home. More women can get a higher education by not having to stay home. It's more gain than loss under this circumstances. The population becomes more productive in the labour market. 


It's not one or the other. This isn't capitalism vs socialism. This is capitalism with acknowledgement of socialist critiques. Yes its private enterprise that keeps the economy a float, that's the point and yes government spends money on the people, that's the point. In most western democracy there exists a mixed economy (public and private sector) and a state that at least does something to help the populous.

And yeah I take it you probably where who tried helping me last time. Thing is its weird. Before with firewall on I was getting less than 8. Restarting bitcoind whole firewall was on I couldn't get more than 5 or 6 peers. But I turned off firewall and let it sync 100%. Since then if I do the same with firewall on and even if from a fresh book I do get more than 8, the client does sync just it sticks around 15 or so peers when I know my server can handle more. Litecoin exhibited even greater behaviour like this. At first it wouldn't connect to any peers with firewall on (and litecoin's port TCP 9333 open). Latterly zero unlike Bitcoin that got a few. But I turned off firewall and litecoin would sync and would get up to around 20-25 peers. Then when turning on firewall it would drop but not to zero it would get around 10. If I restart litecoin with firewall turned on now it does indeed connect and I get that 10-15 or so peers but with firewall on I get more. It's strange behaviour I am yet to figure out.

Best trade/deposit fee wise would be CoinTrader but their volume is shit. QuadriaCX is overall best bet. They sadly change 1.5% deposit fee for Interac online, trade fee is 0.5%. This gives you volume and is chest optionthe plus deposit isinstant (excluding CoinTrader  $2 flat rate deposit fee). 
Other than that there are plenty of more convenient ways to buy with Interac. Such as QuickBT or my preferred choice InstaBT (higher limits but requires them to phone to activate account, their pretty quick with that and will do it in a days time). Several other places even from the international market have started accepting Interac Online (such as AnyCoin). Still these options are typically very expensive fee wise and I *highly* recommend that if you are a Bitcoin user you get an account at an exchange as it is *significantly* cheaper fees. 
I assume you are talking about Interac Online. If your bank doesn't have Interac Online you are out of luck as you can't just use any Interac debit card you need a supported bank.

I fixed the issue. 
The original firewall rule of mine was as follows
    -A INPUT -p tcp -m tcp --dport 8333 -j ACCEPT
This is what Vesta put in for me when I entered into the control panel to open 8333. With this rule the issue I described above occurred. Others online had suggested the following rule to be used instead. 
    -A INPUT -m state --state NEW -m tcp -p tcp --dport 9333 -j ACCEPT
Still this above firewall rule exhibited the same behaviour. I tried the original one changing --dport to --sport. With sport I wouldn't get any more than 8 connections. Incoming connections with sport effectively didn't work. 
Anyways by fluke messing around I solved the problem by using both --sport and --dport. Not sure if it makes sense to do it in the same rule but currently have the two bellow rules in my configuration and it works great. 
    -A INPUT -m state --state NEW -m tcp -p tcp --sport 9333 -j ACCEPT
    -A INPUT -m state --state NEW -m tcp -p tcp --dport 9333 -j ACCEPT

I thought it was that outgoing traffic was denied. There are no rules listed for it. So I added one to permit 8333. Then I realized that the default policy for outgoing is actually allow (Vesta for the most part only set up rules for incoming). So I'm back to square one. It's not working. 
Edit: I got it working. Vesta created some other chain in iptables in addition to the incoming, outgoing, and forward. This other chain is what was causing the problem and I suppose overriding the allow all for outgoing. I erased all rules and it started working immediately.

If you have 0.75 btc in your first address and and 0.25 btc in your second address now you send me 1 btc it came from putting those funds together. Now those two addresses are forever linked. Also transaction between address A and address B are viewable and traceable by the entire world in real time (this is how Bitcoin makes counterfeiting impossible by making it so you can trace the origin of all funds). Despite the transactions being traced it's not apparent as to who the names of A and B are. If no one knows your private (assuming you never linked A and B to C for example when C knows who you are). This pseudonymity makes it possible to swap pseudonyms amongst others to be private. Even that the takes care and time to achieve properly.

They are a German based direct bank who recently announced they are looking to expand to international markets. A direct bank means a bank that has no branches rather operates online or over the phone only. This makes significant savings in operating expenses to the bank and some of these savings get passed onto customer (like no fees and better interest rates). Rather than encourage the typical big bank activity of going to meet with a financial adviser to get scammed out of your money from completely biased advice they actively encourage user based discussions on their forums to get unbiased advice. 
Fidor specifically is very pro Bitcoin. They are partnered with Bitcoin.de and seek to innovate. While they haven't exactly integrated Bitcoin into their bank the day may come and their CEO is rather fond on Bitcoin. 
For anyone who doesn't know the rate difference between a good direct bank and brick and mortar banks can be quite drastic. For example big Canadian banks right now are paying roughly 0.8% interest on a savings account. But that's low which is why I have the highest rate in the country at 2.5% in my savings account. In the US you see Bank of America offering a joke of 0.03% on savings account yet anywhere in the US everyone can get 1.05% from Synchrony Bank. If your off comparing about expensive fees at your bank, go, use a direct bank. I don't pay fees. I believe that first banks we will see adopt Bitcoin will naturally be direct banks as they have nothing to lose (direct bank are already no fees) so they are only benefiting the consumer. Then big banks will then be forced to adopt technology such as Bitcoin due to market pressured.

I only see on the left with the exception of one but it  doesn't say ESTABLISHED but instead SYN_SENT. I think iptables is blocking incoming connections on 8333. I'm not familiar interacting with iptables directly just use to using UFW. I set up server with Vesta Control Panel to manage everything and I used their firewall which is a front end to iptables and it didn't give me any options to select outgoing or incoming. I remember when downloading the bootstrap.dat torrent I didn't see any upload usage only download. I dismissed it assuming maybe there are too many seeders to need me to seed given the great download speeds I obtained but I guess now. Now off to learn IP tables and allow port 8333 for incoming traffic (or is it  outgoing)?

How can you reconcile identifying as a libertarian (I'm presuming you do) and still get behind supporting Tump who want's to expand the police state and supports unconstitutional violations of peoples civil liberties (stop and frisk) and wanting to make that abundant all the while looking to make be just shy of making a certain religion a thought crime.
It's completely contrary to libertarianism to against big government being in my sock drawer.. Mind you I guess there are a lot of conservatives in libertarians clothing.


Sure it wouldn't make a difference voting for them this election. But it helps parties gain momentum. FPTP make it's hard to elect a third party but even then most countries using FPTP have more than two choices. America doesn't get more than two choices unless people demand it then third parties gain momentum. If enough people voted for third parties year after year and they increased then the big parties become scared, then third parties get in debates, then even if they can't win they put the other parties in check and if they don't may then decades down the road a third party gets elected. You can't get somewhere without trying.

By permitting and encouraging business to transition to co-ops and be founded as such. 
Being libertarian means that this can not be mandated rather it is permitted as is private ownership of the means of production.  Society can only achieve full ownership of the means of production if voluntarily consented to by the whole population is achieved. Otherwise you'd see a mixed economy. 
Since this asks for pro decentralization and minarchy societies would be small. They aren't large it's not a mater of nation states its much smaller communities so it's easier for groups of people that think alike to exist in one reason and those who think differently exist elsewhere. 


That's the idea of libertarianism left or right. Rather than forcing people to operate in society a certain way what is need is to convince them on their own will to go about such activity based on the merit of you idea. 


No stealing isn't permitted. Rather workers are themselves the owners of the business the workers own all the profits of the business and as such there's no need for taxation because there doesn't exist a large disparity in income among the general public and the wealthy business owners because capitalism isn't in place as such there is no difference between a business owner and an employee they are one of the same.


As far as I'm concerned the world is too populated and thus diverse for anything that's truly libertarian left or right to work. It's rather a utopian idea. 
However I should note if you take a dozen hippies that all believe in sharing things with each other and have a business idea find  a co op then shove them in the middle of the woods in a remote area and what do you get? A small communist anarchist society. It's most certainty possible but it's rather unlikely to be achieved on full scale anytime in our lives. Humans are too much of an asshole to each other to be nice enough to allow such a society to form and be desirable (that goes for both left/right libertarianism).

Well that's because American gun culture is appalling. That doesn't mean guns in their entirely is appalling. Lots of countries have plenty guns, lots of countries it's perfectly legal and yet they think US gun politics are insane. I live in a country where 1 out of 5 households have guns in them and those gun owners don't understand American's obsession with guns. 
 And let's face it most American gun owners too would probably feel to some extent a similar sentiment, most gun owners  in the US if you look at the polling number do support common sense gun control regulations. But there's a very loud vocal minority of gun owners in the US that the rest of the world sees and then obtain the sentiment American gun culture is insane. Like really holding a wild life refugee hostage with a heavily armed militia? There's far right anti immigrant vigilante heavily armed groups doing their own boarder patrols...

Direct banks are usually more consumer orientated than business and it'll be hard to find any other direct banks that have overdraft fees as low as CapitalOne 360 (which is no overdraft fee only interest, pay back quick it'll be long a few cents). 
None the less direct banks are always going to be the most friendly fee structures and highest interest rates you can find because they are both low cost operator due to not having branches and due to their business model of no  branches they are a much more competitive market as the bank only needs an office in one city to serve an entire nation. 
But there's probably some direct banks that have business accounts and even it's not free it'll have fee structures leaps and bounds better than the big banks.
If you're in the states check out bankrate.com it's an amazing search engine for banks that includes with brick and mortar and direct banks and it makes it supper easy to find the best rate of the particular product you are using. 
Anyways the most important thing to remember is that 1) you do not need to live near a bank to be it's customer. The internet allows for you to use your bank anywhere over the internet and/or phone making distance irrelevant and 2) there's no such thing as the best banks. There's definitely superior banks but don't put all your eggs in one basket, no bank is best at everything. So use the competition available to you and use multiple banks one that's best checking account use for checking the one that's best savings account use for you savings, use the bank best for lending as the bank you use for lending. Then your experience with banks will be very good and you'll feel like you've cheated the system because you aren't being fucked by the banks while ~90% of the country is.

Out you know you could just use an account CapitalOne 360  and pay no fee and something like a few $0.05 in overdraft fees...
Really the free mark has already solved this by coming up with no cost direct banks. The internet rather has solved this problem making free chequing accounts a thing. People just don't use them because the mainstream would rather be told what to do from advertisements rather than research and discover the plethora of direct banks that exist.

You call it brainwashing they'd call it compassion for fallow man. It's not about giving money to the state it's about giving it to each other providing services that we/they as a tax payer make use of. 


They aren't socialist. Nordic capitalism is still capitalism. I get what your saying just pointing out what your referring to is social democracy and/or social liberalism not actual socialism which is much more to the left. 




This we can agree on. You can't have your cake and eat it too. So many want to get free things and not have to pay for them this is a problem because then you run out of other people's money and you get deficit spending (of course should note what Tatcher is talking about here isn't socialism but center-left capitalism...). 
You see while Greece, Italy, even American are great examples of spending money that they don't have. This isn't the case with Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Finland because there they are will to pay more taxes they don't run out of other people's money because they have enough of other people's money not  to run out of it. [Look at debt to GDP ratios of countries the EU overall is high, the US much higher but Sweden, Finland, Norway, Denmark](  much lower rather in check and sustainable because there they're willing to pay for what they use.

I'm well aware of the right winged libertarian perspective as to why it is incompatible.
I'm merely saying that from my perspective which is rather more so in line with that of the Pirate Party is that it is very much so compatible and they fit perfectly hand in hand.
 It's very much so possible to think that taxes should pay to help the population live a more pleasurable life and subscribe to the ideals of cryptoanarchy believing that government must have it's limitations and not exist in areas that do not best serve the public's interests.
And as for the notion that taxes cannot exist in a world in which bitcoin does. Guess what they already do, people already pay taxes on Bitcoin and KYC/AML policies already exist that help enforce this. Bitcoin may most certainly make taxation harder it doesn't make it impossible neither does the existence of cash.

So this one would vary by country and bank depending on where you live you might be out of luck. 
So basically direct banks that offer savings accounts only, which by the way are leaps and bounds higher interest rates than big banks especially in the US where big banks tend to offer laughable interest rates of like 0.05% and direct banks will give you something like 0.9% it's pretty significant. Here in Canada my savings is 1.75% it used to be a steady  3% for years but then oil/interest prices/rates declined... Anyways with these savings account only banks usually the only way to get money in/out is to do a bank transfer (eg.  ACH, EFT, SEPA).
For banks with chequeing accounts all the big ones allow for photo cheque deposits in a smart phone app all you do is take a picture if the cheque and it's deposited (my bank gives me the funds instantly with no holding period). 
As for ATM direct banks tend to take one of two approaches. A) have an agreement with a large national ATM network allowing customers to use those ATMs for free. Or B) allow users to use any ATM for free by refunding them all ATM fees. A few banks like Charles Schwab do this internationally allowing to use all ATM's world wide for free. 
Now as for depositing actual cash in hand in the US AFAIK you can't. Direct banks in the US seem to only allow you to  withdraw cash from ATM's got free but have no deposit methods for cash. Even CapitalOne which has their own ATM network only let's CapitalOne 360 (direct bank version) customers can only deposit cheques through their ATMs no cash. 
Now here in Canada perhaps in part because none of the direct banks allow you to use all ATMs for free instead have have an agreement with large ATM networks. For some direct banks they have agreements with the big banks to let customers use the big banks ATM network or they use a joint ATM network made up of many banks and credit unions across the country (eg. The Exchange Network) that then allow you to use any member institutions ATM for free. In either case this allows you to use both deposit and withdrawal functions of the ATM free of cost. So from any of the main 4 direct banks you can deposit cash using their respective ATM networks just as you would if you were a customer of big banks. I believe something similar would occur in various other countries too where direct banks give you both withdraw/deposit functions of their ATM networks.

No. SWIFT (  [Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication](    )  isn't a money transfer network. It's a telecommunications network used to transfer information then used to fulfil wire transfers through (sometimes many) correspondent banks. Bitcoin on the other hand is an actual money transfer network. 
You see if your a big bank sending  money to an other big bank you might be fine to send directly between each other. Citi would likely wire money directly to Barclays. But let's say you are a smaller bank and you are sending to a smaller bank in a foreign country. Now you may need to send money from you to say Citi who might send it to ICICI who then delivers it to an other no name bank in India. SWIFT just let the  two small banks communicate with each other securely so that they can then find a path to transfer the money. This path can sometimes include several banks each wanting  to take a fee. 
The Bitcoin approach allows for middle men to be cut out and if both banks are parentered with an exchange the  they both have liquid cheap access to Bitcoin and the Bitcoin can then be sent directly between banks cutting out all the unnecessary middle men.

Bitcoin is just data. Mesh networks transmit data. You don't need a specific coin. You will need the mesh network to have through the means of some of its peers access to the Internet or else you'd have a different blockchain and your segregated mesh network would have enough miners to secure the network.

Saying not having Segwit on Bitcoin costs Bitcoin $40 billion isn't a fair comparison. Litecoin's market cap is under a billion Bitcoin's is over $20 billion. 
Anyone who knows anything about financial markets 101 knows that larger cap assets are Lowe volatility and thus when they increase in price they see smaller increases. Smaller market cap assets can see large increases far easier. Litecoin is up about 200% because of Segwit. Bitcoin wouldn't go up nearly as high as a result of Segwit because the bulls actions will have a lesser impact on a higher market cap currency, although it sure would see a price increase none the less.

But what I'm saying is. How do you foster enough competition for something like broadband while preventing the growth an an oligopoly? You need competition to be plentiful to make the business behave by fighting for customers. 
It's easy to go ahead and say phone and TV can be plentiful in competition because of VOIP and IPTV that can use preexisting Internet infrastructure to provide a range of services to customers and this allows for a lot of such companies because they don't need to build broad physical infrastructure to provide a service. It's easy to have a hundred or so VOIP providers serve your area. They can do it from a few  central offices. But then you have something like Internet this requires a lot of spread out physical infrastructure and a dense enough customer base in that area to make it viable to maintain and invest in such infrastructure. So even if instead of 1 or 2 ISPs in your area and there's enough competition for that 5 or so ISPs how is it that those 5 don't form an oligopoly? It's it really viable to see enough competition for physical broadband to give customers enough choice to enforce net neutrality? Or maybe we will all just need to build mesh nets to solve the problem.

You got to prepare yourself when trading for your position to move against you and then use it to your advantage. 
If you want to buy up $1000 worth for example don't do it at X price. Instead buy say $200 now and place a couple bids lower and lower. This way if the price moves against you you get to use it to your advantage by buying up the rest cheaper. In the event prices move up so you make less than if you bought all right away but you still get to average up and that's something by far worth it when it means less risk of losses. Buying more when you're in an already profitable position is great because if it goes up you make more but if it goes down at least you can still get stopped out for a profit. 
Never go in all at once slowly work your way into a position over the course of hours and days. Be patient. 
That's what works for me. I've never got the hang much of day trading. But swing trading oh boy has that been great for me, less stressful and less risky. Over the past week or two I made a nice couple of 20-30% gains on my trades. Overall I pretty much wound up doubling my money. What a time to be alive.

I would think so yes. Electrum is deterministic though so as addresses change and your IP changes with TOR (which should happen every 10 min) then it helps to prevent association of addresses especially if you keep using different Electrum server and the addresses you use slowly change. Still this is far  from optimal and association would be easy. If someone re-coded Electrum optimizing it for TOR so that it can utilize stream isolation in TOR to search up the addresses then with each address using a different circuit then this association wouldn't occur.

You need to download the required apps and then you can run Python on Android through that app and thus Electum. Overall though it's messy and far from the clean experience of an Android wallet that we are more accustom to.

"Be greedy when others are fearful and fearful when others are greedy". 
Yeah it's a great time to buy, Bitcoin is on discount. That said he cautious. You can't eye the bottom but that's where you want to buy. So catch it as it falls. If you want to buy say $1k well buy $200 now and place a variety of bids between $100 and $500 lower than current price and wait out the market a couple of weeks. If those get filled good for you you averaged down and took less risk and got in at  a batter price. If the market goes you well you got some Bitcoin at a good price and once the market had regained some confidence got can buy the rest. 
Always catch a falling knife with caution or else you're going to get stabbed.

30,000 tps is over doing it. But just a few thousand a second would put it in line with some of the more popular payment networks. Considering that all Bitcoin are only mined by around 2140 by the time (presumably earlier) that the block reward isn't enough to incentive miners its reasonable to say that Bitcoin could become a big enough network for low fees to maintain it.

Funny because that's literally part of the [Pirate Party in Canada's platform.](
Also who said that because they're "left" they'd want to give everyone free income...
Now let's look at a breakdown some of the [Pirate Party of Iceland's platform](
























Their philosophy is what's called Pirate Politics. It's basically a big F off to copyright and patent trolls, pro internet freedoms, anti intellectual property rights (or at the least anti extensive intellectual property rights), pro transparency, pro civil liberties, freedom of speech and net neutrality pro encryption and so forth.
Then they coupled this with centre-left fiscal policies based on the belief of what you could call collective individualism.  That we are all free that the government should be there not to hinder our freedom but rather to protect our freedom and aid us to aspire to achieve our individual goals.
It's the anti-establishment [center-left]( (read that as I get the sense you consider centre-left to be the same as far left). Sort of the mentality of the rebellious 1960s anti war hippy mentality referred to as the [new left.]( It's like if Bernie Sanders started to call himself a  pirate and embrace drugs.
Yes it's probably fair to say some of their views share an overlap with those of [left-wing libertarianism]( 
People have to understand that neither freedom nor authoritarianism is bound to the left-right political spectrum. [The political spectrum is more like quadrant as such.](  But no instead people would rather have an homogeneous view of anyone on the other side of the left-right spectrum rather than acknowledge the numerous philosophies contradictory to each other that exist the same side(s).

A VPN knows what you are doing (essentially only 1 node is used).  TOR uses 3 different nodes to make a circuit  each only knowing the IP of its self and that which it connects to. The end result is that the exit node (the IP Electrum will get) doesn't also know what your real IP is as long as both exit and entry node aren't controlled by same participant. A VPN = high bandwidth increased privacy and prevents your ISP from spying/throttling/censoring you. TOR does that while providing anonymity but at the expense of giving you much less bandwidth. Some people will use both TOR and VPN.

I'm not saying Pirate Party is libertarian left they aren't exactly but there's an overlap between "Pirate" politics and views libertarians would share in regards to technology and the internet. 
What Libertarian left actually is, is they are against the state and seeks to share *outside* of the framework of the state due to their opposition of the state. 
Look up [libertarian socialism]( for example that asks for a minarchist society that's pro decentralized and desires a shared means of production by being pro unions. 
Left does not inherently mean using the state to take money from people and give it to others. That's what the modern left under a capitalist framework do. But left can also refer to actual socialism which puts the means of production in the hands of the worker in the first place thus diminishing the need for taxes as people would then (in theory) have roughly equal incomes to start with making society more or less equal absent taxation.

Currently it's needed to subsidize transactions if not we would need to pay far more in transaction fees. Satoshi thought it out well. Have high block reward to start to subside the network and encourage mining while not needing high fees then as time progresses and Bitcoin becomes more popular a higher volume of transactions can result in low fees with lesser and lesser need to subsidize the transactions. So no it's not a problem. Now if only Satoshi made max block size greater than 1 MB.

People are shorting the market. In other words they're betting that the price will drop and want to make a profit off that drop. 
The way this works is that people borrow Bitcoin form other users (who lend it out for interest). Traders then sell this borrowed Bitcoin for dollars. If the price drops they get to buy back the Bitcoin they sold for cheaper therefore paying their debt to who they borrowed from, because they bought cheaper than what they sold then they get to keep the difference and effectively make a profit. 
What happens is that if the price goes up they however need to buy back for higher. If price keeps rising short positions will have to buy Bitcoin at a higher price to prevent further losses. 
Additionally this is all margin trading. In the case of Bitfinex you can go 3.3x leveraged. Meaning if you have $1000 in your account you can borrow up to $3300 of Bitcoin to short (or of dollars to buy Bitcoin and go long if you'd rather do that). Now because people are borrowing more than they have this means they can only tolerate a certain amount as a loss (because losses must come from the traders collateral to pay back their debts), if losses become too big they won't have enough collateral to pay back their debts. So before that happens Bitfinex will forcibly buy back Bitcoin for (taking all of the users collateral) to insure that the creditor (which are other users) get back all the Bitcoin they borrowed plus interest. When this happens it is referred to as a "forced liquidation". 
Essentially if a lot of people bet big that the market will crash it and doesn't then they'll be forced to cover their shorts (buy back Bitcoin at a higher price). This means a lot of market buy orders will happen. Subsequently prices will go far higher as short positions are required to buy Bitcoin to pay back their debts. They don't have a choice to place a bid at a lower price as the creditor then wouldn't be guaranteed to have their funds returned. So it's almost like panic buying.

All fees in Bitcoin are optional and the fee paid is chosen by the end user. I can pay 0 fees now but relative to what others are willing to pay I'll opt to pay 0.0001 BTC to get a higher priority than no fee. Due to other users paying the same or minimally higher then my transaction is included in the block. While miners can play a role is what the fees are by restricting block size it is the market that determines the fee. A competition of the will of the Bitcoin users (the majority of people) and the miners (a much smaller group of Bitcoiners).

It may very well add up collectively to a decent amount of bank. Sending it to the electrical company makes most sense. It can go towards your bill and funding of the electrical grid. If you want install custom firmware on your WiFi connected lightbulb to send it to your own address. It's likely though that your lightbulb uses more electricity than profit it produces but if what is more important the network at the bear minimal expense of mining then it's worth it.

 Still most Canadians aren't with access to this (though it's likely easy for them to get) only the 4 largest (4 not 5, CIBC doesn't support it) banks in the country support Interac Online and 2 credit Unions that's all. Of those institutions only account holders that do not have Visa debit can use it. Of those big 4 that means that roughly no one at TD can use Interac Online and BMO is the only one AFAIK that doesn't even offer any Visa debit leaving it up to circumstances if RBC and Scotia accounts work with Interac Online (the code of conduct for the credit and debit card industry prevents the utilization of 2 different online payment methods in the same account).

You're looking in the wrong places. You probably won't be able to find AMD cards in stock unless you preorder. But it's pretty easy to find GTX 1060, 1070, 1080, 1080 TI just on Newegg.ca alone. There's still a few places that will have RX 580s but it's a once in a blue moon event. Canada Computers probably has one or two lurking in stock in some small town somewhere in Ontario. 
Also if you want you can buy GTX 780 TI on eBay. These cards are horrible at mining. So they're pretty cheap. Thing is in terms of gaming they're about as fast (or even faster) than a GTX 1060.

With no hashrate committed to it and all hashrate signaling BIP91 then they'll just mine the current chain. Even Bitmain won't mine ABC because it's lost profits when he could be mining Bitcoin.

Sure fits with libertarian socialism. Even to democratic socialism in that there's no central authority rather we the people through running nodes and miners own/operate/control the means of production of the currency as oppose to a central banks where it's controlled merely by that one entity. For the same reason I'm sure there's a chunk of communist anarchist that line bitcoin too (I say a chunk as many of those may not even believe in money it's self). That it would allow for much greater transparency in transactions in how government handles money is yet an other reason your see social democrats she democratic socialist may see merit in it. 
No doubt bitcoin is a perfect fit for libertarians be it left or right libertarianism. There's no denying that. But that doesn't mean that because it fits that ideology that it is therefore only compatible with it.

A POW change from the most secured algorithm (POW is more secure with a higher hashrate no other crypto has the amount of resources devoted to it as Bitcoin) to some randomly new one that only GPUs would be able to secure and won't be able to amass enough miners secure to the extent anywhere near Bitcoin makes zero sense.

Because other altcoins will continue to do a variety of things Bitcoin doesn't an innovate in ways that Bitcoin can't. Different people have different visions which create different coins that compete against each other in the market.

Current blocks are 1MB. The core non witness data block (or what ever you want to call it) is still 1 MB with Segwit. That's what I'm referring too. 
In practice by separating the witnesses data the block for all practical purposes is like its 2-4 MB. 
2X would mean the non witness block is 2 MB but with Segwit too it for all practical purposes is larger than 2MB.
Any how that's asides the point. Equating 8MB block to gigabyte blocks is just as silly.

It's an open platform anyone is free to develop on as are they. I really don't understand this whole "Segwit2x is a corporate take over overthrowing core"  mentality. There's already several different nodes for Bitcoin developed and core is the dominant one.

Miners are free to use what software they want as are users and any developer. Most people will  likely continue to run core.

If there is a zero day exploit in the browser the  malicious Javascript can exploit it to bypass TOR. This however requires that you are using a version of the Web browser prone to such exploits (which is why it's very important to always update to latest version) but also requires malicious scripts to be used. This insinuates that either Reddit is purposefully exploiting security vulnerabilities of its user (I doubt that) or  that people are visiting the unencrypted version of the site and a man in the middle is used to interject malicious code. TOR comes with HTTPS Everywhere installed to prevent this and NoScript (although disabled by default) is also available so only white listed scripts can run while others are blocked.

It is more legitimate. The NASDAQ has larger capital requirements. It's where big companies go and big investors go. Governments also treat it differently. For example as a Canadian I can invest and make tax free gains on something listed on the NASDAQ by putting it in my TFSA. However I can't put something from OTCMarkets in my TFSA so I would need to pay tax on that (in which case I have no motivation to use a Bitcoin fund on OTCMarkets but one on the NASDAQ I have a large incentive to hold over regular Bitcoin's due to taxes).

Boarder security goes through phones and electronic devices if they suspect it is hiding something illegal like child porn (because apparently pedos don't know how to use the Internet to send files and require physical transport of hard drives). Also if there are contradictory things about your story. For example if you are entering Canada and say you are coming for a month they ask you how much money you have and say you where fired from your job and broke then they start suspecting you are here to work. So they may go though your phone to find and find communications either for or against that story. Is he emailing people looking for a job?

I'm referring to LTC/BTC charts. It seems that there's a flow of Bitcoin being sold to buy Litecoin. While the crypto market crashes relative to both BTC and USD with Litecoin it is going up relatively to BTC. 
Throw in how Bitcoin can't figure out if its going to hard fork. Ethereum has already forked long ago and is planning to 2 other hardforks. Then Litecoin just chilling acting all mature with bigger blocks and Segwit and miners coming to consensus and not forking. 
Really I don't think we'd be in this situation of Bitcoin Core devs did what Litecoin did and just make the Segwit MASF with a 75% threshold. 95% on Bitcoin was never going to happen we could of achieved 75% (sitting around 50% now) and then we wouldn't be in this mess.

There can be different tokens and merge mine. It's called auxiliary proof of work. This is what Dogecoin adopted (because it couldn't maintain it's self) where it uses Litecoin's hashrate to secure its blockchain. Everyone mining Litecoin effectively also can using the same computations mine Doge. This however requires it to be worked into the code of the second coin (in the above example Doge).

You can buy penny stock representative of Bitcoin due to Bitcoin held on reserve backing those shares. It means Bitcoin can in a sense be bought through a brokerage account.

This is pink sheets. It's easy to get listed stock. OTCMarkets (the exchange this is traded on) already have several marijuana companies stock and even Bitcoin Shop trades there. While this fund might be first publicly traded it is not to the caliber of ETFs traded on exchanges the NASDAQ or NYSE Arca.

No a hard fork isn't backwards compatible. 
For example Segwit is a soft fork, because it adheres to old rules then old nodes that weren't designed for Segwit will still accept Segwit blocks as valid and relay them. 
Under a hard fork old nodes won't accept the new blocks (eg. 2 MB blocks) as valid because it violates the rules. So it's not backwards compatible.

Transactions on tune blockchain can be tracked but names aren't attached to the transaction. If I go off and buy a vape online  now with a credit card the  bank, MasterCard, and the merchant all know who I am and where  I spent my money. 
With Bitcoin the transaction can be traced and it can be traced by anyone but if I bought on an exchange that exchange might know who I am but then I send you merchant. Now if I bought online and need it delivered then the merchant knows my name. But although the transaction can be traced the exchange doesn't know who I sent it to. The merchant uses a different address for each transaction. The merchant doesn't know who I am unless I tell them. The merchant doesn't know what bank I have an account at. The merchant would need to cooperate with the exchange for either party to know for sure who sent the money where and from where. 
Now with Bitcoin being pseudonyms like this it makes it easy to use tumblers to trade pseudonyms amongst other users then further obscuring who did what. Tumblers make Bitcoin anonymous if desired by making the reality of who transacted what occur off-chain then what happens on-chain paints a different picture.

Well if they where encrypted and stored properly then the government wouldn't be able to just take them. Math wouldn't allow it. So for the government to have the ability to seize Bitcoin (which is contrary to what Bitcoin is designed to allow for) It means that very poorly of a job was taken to secure the Bitcoin in the first place. In that sense they have been forfeited. It's like saying you are going to put $50k under a chair at McDonald's and hope no one will notice it's there. But if you put it in a vault instead...

Ugh no. Not at all. You need SEC approval to get your stocks listed on the NASDAQ and NYSE for example, they're à securities regulator. Without SEC approval you'd be stuck listing your stock as some shitty pink sheets on OTCMarkets. 
Accredited investors is for privately listed stocks not publicly listed securities. Rich people don't want the common Joe not to be able to buy stocks they want them to, because when anyone  can buy stocks that means more demand meaning higher prices resulting in the rich making even more money than they otherwise would. 
It's not like the SEC doesn't have any bullshit regulations (like the pattern day trader rule which security regulators in other countries don't have an equivalent too and fits your statement about protecting the rich if you will) but that's not the primary objective.

It's actually reasonable to say that in the *long run* that Bitcoin is weakening SHA. Bitcoin ever increasing difficulty results in continually upgrading hardware to stay competitive and solve blocks. Thus creates demand,  money, research, and then products are created. Mores  law also applies. Just think of how Bitcoin started at GPUs and then FPGAs and now ASICs of ever increasing computing power. 
Now cryptography is always possible to break. However with a long enough key size it becomes so hard to break that what is within the realms of possibility is considered impossible. Still as a result of Bitcoin the ability to compete SHA and there for eventually break it (or certain implementations) is indirectly achieved by Bitcoin. The parent comment  is just going overboard and butcoin with some NSA conspiracy and dismissing Bitcoin for its wonders.

Central banks play a role still they aren't the only determining factor in interest rates and interest rates already do vary significantly between  banks. 
Let's Look at Chase. They will not pay more than [0.1% on a savings account. Even then in order to be eligible for that you must have at minimum $250k. Their starting rate on a savings account is 0.03%.]( Bank of America won't even go above 0.03% regardless of the amount. These are called fucking jokes because any [American can get 1.00% from Synchrony Bank for any amount. Be it $50 or $100k.]( No my decimal places aren't a mistake people still have a saving account at BOA despite being able to get 3233% more interest at the competition. The difference is drastic. 
Now let's look outside the joke of the US's big 4 illusion of an oligopoly in the banking sector. In Canada RBC (the biggest bank in the country) [will pay 0.8% on deposits]( meanwhile my Canadian savings account at Peoples Trust pays 2.5% interest and actually outpaces the CPI. 
So yeah. There is a huge difference already and when you see the big crap greedy fucks of a bank go negative interest rate I assure you you'll find competition offering positive interest.

The only way to upgrade a fundamental part of the protocol is to indeed fork. The question then becomes a hard fork vs a soft for or a combination of the two. A soft fork however can result in a chain split if the majority of the miners do not support such a soft fork. 
Bitcoin blocks have a 1MB size cap. This results in about 3-7 transactions per second capacity. Bitcoin has reached this limit and cannot scale  without a fork of some kind. The options are stay as is and loose the title of the dominate crypto currency as people can no longer effectively transact in it as it doesn't have the capacity to handle  the world, or upgrade the protocol so as to allow for greater capacity.

Well conventional wisdom would say buy now as Segwit isn't yet active and when it is prices will rise as that's what the market wants. 
On the flip side it's possible that Segwit has been priced in already and as a result since it doesn't go higher people will start to dump. 
What happens nobody knows. So either flip a coin or mitigate risk by buying some now and buying the rest in say 2 weeks to average your way in. 
The smart decision was do as I did buy in before today in anticipation of today. Since it was foreseeable this would happen.

BIP148 does nothing if Segwit activates through BIP91. 
BIP148 has a minority of the hashing power backing it. It too would of resulted in users forking off the network. That is mostly just people in Reddit. BIP91 is here saving the day preventing a chainsplit (of course it later plans to fork but that's 6 months from now). It's because of this prices are rising. The market doesn't want UASF to case a chainsplit. 
Silbert didn't command anyone, he brokered a deal no one else was able to do. He did what was next to impossible and that is to get miners to actually come to consensus on how to upgrade the protocol.

Bitmain says they won't even mine BCC if Segwit2x goes though. Even then chances are they won't since market likely don't have interest in BCC so profit incentive makes them want to mine Bitcoin instead. 
Now the only way Bitmain would pull off a 51% attack is if other miners ditch Bitcoin for BitcoinABC given Bitmain more hashrate on Bitcoin relatively speaking than they have now. This won't happen because of it does that means that Bitmain also would be mining BCC. 
The only way what you're suggesting is possible is if there's a way to use the same miners to mine on both blockchains absent merge mining which would require supported code in BitcoinABC and is effectively akin BitcoinABC dying on a life raft  (cough, cough, DogeCoin) then I don't see how it'd be possible to mine on both blockchains with same hardware. Even then in the scenario that they could mine on both blockchains then this means other miners would do the same also. So Bitmain's hashrate relative to others wouldn't go up on Bitcoin.

The Venezuelan Bolivar (their fiat currency) is basically really crappy. This is a country that often sees inflation around the 50% mark. They also make Dollars illegal. Essentially while on Google you'll see a certain exchange rate for the Bolivar to Dollar that's the official rate. Due to the legality of dollars and no one in Venezuela viewing a Bolivar as any store of wealth the Dollar is sold on the black market. Like anything on the black market it has in inflated price and so it costs more to exchange Bolivar to Dollars than what is the official rate.
Now Bitcoin trade is dominated in USD and CNY. So when people will buy their Bitcoin with Bolivar they aren't paying the official USD equivalent in Bolivar, much rather they are paying the black market equivalent of USD in Bolivar in exchange for Bitcoin.
It's the same situation in Argentina.

For example if you add your purchases together with time bought you got a book value for each purchase. Now you calculate a market value. Then when you spend Bitcoin it subtracts the amount of Bitcoin from the book. Now you can choose to spend when you have a gain.

As long as the majority of the hashrate is enforcing BIP91 then it doesn't matter because the longest chain wins and non  BIP91 enforcing nodes will fallow it. On August 1st UASF nodes will orphan those blocks too. In the meantime do you part and run a BIP91 node.

If you hold it in Coinbase you won't. They've said they won't reward users with BCC. So they'll just keep them for themselves. If you want BCC you'll need to withdraw your Bitcoin to a wallet you control and then after the fork you'll own both.

Signaling BIP91 is signaling Segwit2x. The 2X hard fork comes in 6 months from now (if that actually happens is up in the air). The Segwit soft fork activates at the end of this month is 80% is reached. 
Miners who don't want Segwit won't signal BIP91. UASF is incentivizing them to support it because if they don't there's a chainsplit and prices drop hurting their profit margins.
@_date: 2017-07-21 20:46:59

I didn't say 100% of miners agree with me. But it seems pretty evident that miners agree that BIP148 shouldn't cause a chain split resulting in UASF148 nodes backing the same chain (rather than a different chain) that is  backed by 100% mined blocks as it stands. 
My point is saying BCC has more support from miners that UASF148 is ridiculous given 100% are mining the same chain as UASF148.

Who said he's actually a member of the Hells Angels. For all we know Redandwhite and FriendlyChemist are the same person just going off and extorting DPR for money. 
FriendlyChemist goes off and asks for money saying he will expose customers info he has a back story that says he needs the money to pay his debt to the Hells Angles. This attempt fails then FriendlyChemist  creates Redandwhite when DPR asks to speak to his distributor. 
DPR is so caught up in drug dealing online that he thinks a distributor in the Hells Angeles would actually give a rats ass about FriendlyChemist's story of how he is selling the drugs on this anonymous website with magic internet money. So FriendlyChemist goes off and makes Redandwhite's account and orchestrates a plot to get DPR to willingly give him lots of Bitcoin in order to make the FriendlyChemist problem go away. Then FriendlyChemist/Redandwhite  get's the money he wants.

In the end Coinbase pays more for miners fees. Users who send the Bitcoin pay the miners fee. Not the merchants. Now if you pay with Coinbase account since Bitcoin is already in the account then no transaction is broadcasted to the network and it is just Coinbase changing their ledger (off-chain transaction). However Coinbase when sending Bitcoin on-chain from a Coinbase wallet to Bitcoin address pays the transaction fees (except for when it's micro transactions).

BIP91 says that blocks that don't signal BIP141 (Segwit) will be orphaned. BIP91 required 80% miner support to do this. BIP141 requires 95% (this maintains soft fork capability with rules outlined in BIP91 and backwards compatible with old nodes).
Because BIP141 requires 95% support to be averaged out over two weeks to activate this is very hard to do. BIP91 after maintaining 80% for two days activates, this is much easier to achieve. BIP91 forced the remaining 15% required to activate Segwit to signal Segwit so that it can then activate because BIP91 forces everyone to signal BIP141 (if they don't their blocks are rejected, they essentially can't mine and if they want to mine their stuck signaling BIP141).

Bitcoin Cash is something that's coming out of thin air. It'll give everyone who has Bitcoin the equivalent amount of Bitcoin Cash as the time that it forks. 
So that it come out of thin air makes it of little value. Furthermore it's a UAHF. If it was a MAHF then that would be different story because then it'd only occur with the backing if miners. But with a UAHF it forks regardless. Meaning just about no one will mine it so it won't be secure ever if people don't start mining it (they won't if it's less profitable than Bitcoin) then it'll eventually die off and/or be subject to attack. So people will sell these coins that come out of thin air and few would want to buy something that came out of no where with guarantee of being secure. The result is vast supply little demand, lots of sales and few buys. The price of BCC will tank spectacularly. 
If one day BCC gains enough miners who knows if it could take off. But in the short term it's going nowhere.

Just buy Bitcoin and if you want stocks buy actual stocks on the stock exchange so you actually own them.
 The only "stocks" in the Bitcoin world are either some super not regulated claim to be a stock that is more likely than not a scam. Or some type of derivative that is meant for trading which mimics the dollar  fluctuations of a stock but again isn't owning an actual stock.

Makes sense. They aren't saying that 95% were cashed out through Btc-e but that they went through it. I wouldn't be shocked if 95% went through Bitfinex to. 
Btc-e is a big altcoin exchange too and they didn't require KYC just to trade. So take your dirty Bitcoin send to BTC-e trade for say Litecoin send to Bitfinex trade that back to Bitcoin and withdraw. It's a lot cheaper to mix coins this way than to pay 3% to a tumbler on the dark net that's less trust worthy than a major exchange. That doesn't necessarily mean they were complicit in this.

It's money that's decentralized. That never happened before and never could it. Think before hand to have money, it's really just a ledger. Now we needed to trust someone to maintain this ledger. This gives us two options. Government or privatization. So the question was then who is more reasonable to handle the fundamental backbone of money.    Now I'm sure isn't shy of having a good old fashion circle jerk about who the lesser of those two evils are. The money system we exist in today is made on some sort of hybrid between government and banks. Now it's very apparent that both government and corporations can be corrupted. It's reasonable to say that both can do things that aren't in the best interest of the people when they are in control of the monetary supply. Now Bitcoin comes along and we have a new option. We no longer need to decide who is the lesser of the two evils because now we can opt to have a monetary system backed by neither. That's why I like Bitcoin. I don't think there is anyone responsible enough to have control over money and the fact that the majority of the world's currencies are shit proves that. Other people will draw the same conclusion. Especially those in the third world.

I like Quadriga they seem nice but Quadriga is 1.5% deposit fee for Interac Online (all other deposit methods are free). With CoinTrader now having CAD orderbook they are cheapest for Interac with flat rate fee of $2. With trading fees being same or lower on CoinTrader they seem like great option. But Quadriga is still higher volume. 
Bitcoin was meant to be instant so I love the ability deposit fiat instantly. The way Bitcoin was meant to be, fast to buy. If you aren't using Interac though Quadriga works out better for you most likely. Plus Quadriga has Interac email transfer for withdrawals which is nice.

BCC will crash because the market has no reason  to have confidence in it and its a UAHF which means there's no commitment of any hashrate to mine it so its no different than just you or I forking off the network. It'll die off fairly quickly. Everyone BTC holder will dump their BCC right away BCC will pulmet. No one will mine it because it's more profitable for them to mine BTC and BCC will just die with no hashrate to sustain  it (or at the least no hashrate strong enough to secure it).

I live in Canada  it's not instant. An EFT takes just as long as an ACH. Still we do also have the Interac network wich is instant (or near instant in case of email transfer). While this allows Canadians to buy Bitcoin instantly support for Interac Online (the part of Interac used to buy Bitcoin) is very limited and only supported by some banks. Interac is only suited for certain types of transactions and often an EFT is required (which takes usually 2-3 business days). 
SEPA are most certainly faster and superior. However even a SEPA at its fastest takes a few hours. In the UK it is literally instant.

No there is QuadrigaCX and CoinTrader.net both Canadian exchanges. In fact Quadriga is a far better exchange than CaVirtex ever was and was often recommended over them. Soon after VOS shut down CoinTrader added a CAD order book (they where previously USD only despite being Canadian). CoinTrader actually works out best for instant deposit via Interac as they have lowest fees for that. Both CoinTrader and Quadriga are overall lower fees than CaVritex.
Really CaVirtex shutting down comes as no disappointment to most of us. They where for quite some time the most controversial and hated exchange in the country and to this day remain the most expensive and least competitive out of all domestic exchanges. They however were the first exchange and managed to attract greater volume than the other exchanges. That network effect is probably what kept them going.

It's a lot different of a situation with Electrum vs MultiBit. Electrum accesses a centralized server that runs a node each time it  wants to know what address you are looking looking up. MultiBit however interacts directly with various nodes and only downloads relevant parts of the blockchain plus some random info for privacy reasons. This means you aren't dealing directly with a limited amounts server that knows all requests are for people's wallet.

No that doesn't mean dropping 2X. Segwit2x means both Segwit and double the block size. They aren't mutually exclusive. 
It's not unreasonable for BitPay to think that merely Segwit isn't enough because let's face it LN still interacts the blockchain and eventually LN would get bottlenecked by the hardcap on block size. It's not unreasonable to foresee this and think it a better to fork now when Bitcoin is still relatively young.

It's saying that is the lock-in threshold is reached then it'll activate and there's no going back. So even if it drops below 80% saying at 80% long enough to achieve lock-in then it'll activate. 
Usually the idea behind a lock-in period here is so that it doesn't just activate right away. It gets set in stone that it will and then has a grace period so that those who had previously abstained have time to upgrade their software.

If that happens then that means 80%+ of miners are behind if including the exchanges and so forth that are also backing the NYA. So at that point Segwit2x will be Bitcoin. Or it won't happen at all. It's very unlikely that Segwit2x exists as a minority chain against the current chain.

I don't think there's any signaling for it. It's a UAHF not a MAHF. Wasn't designed to say fork if X amount to of miners signal. Nah it's just designed fork on X date regardless of miner support. Which is why it's unlikely to gain much miner support.

Put your Bitcoin in your own wallet before the fork. Then hold them there. After the fork transfer your BTC to a new wallet. Import the previous wallet that you had before the fork into a BCC wallet then you'll have the BCC there as you only transfered out the BTC not the BCC. 
I'd suggest using Bitcoin Core as BitcoinABC has a fork of this already. Their Electrum fork isn't ready yet.

It's a soft fork. How should it possibly be a hard fork? How could it even be a hard fork given that by it's nature it's a soft fork?


I don't care about UASF either. Which is why I run a BIP91 node instead. It only makes sense to do MASF or MAHF. Anything without the support of miners be it UASF or UAHF (like in the case of BCC) is basically a sibyl attack.

A block size increase can be accomplished with a  MAHF (Miner Activated Hard Fork). This post is Coinbase opposing a UAHF (User Activated Hard Fork) which is a much different far more radical idea as the chain would die off right away  unless enough hashrate supported it. In which case why not just MAHF where it'd only happen if miners signalled in support of it?

No, nodes enforce the consensus rules and validate transactions. Miners secure a chain of transactions by contributing resources and ordering transactions in alignment with rules derived from nodes. Miners prevent double spending because nodes can't be trusted not to double spend. 
Edit: Well at the end of the day it's kind of both miners and nodes because the market is really what determines what rules to back, miners inevitably chose what chain to mine at the market will get behind what chain is more secure, however the market also bends miners to its will because they have the profit incentive to mine the most or profitable chain.

Is there any indication that these "villains" control the majority of the hashrate? If not then they're doing more to secure the network than fight it. 
No denying much greater competition is needed in the ASIC market. Particularly for consumers. 
Do you realize that A) not all GPU mined coins are shit and that B) if everyone was mining Bitcoin with GPUs all it takes is Jihan to be the first one to successfully developed and ASIC for it and then he can control the network and vastly overpower all of GPUs in the world? Meanwhile now we're in a situation where there's at least a handful of ASIC manufacturers that are co-existing. One guy having an ASIC against a lot other GPUs is a threat. Several people having ASICs competing against others with ASICs are far less of a threat.

Truth is the entire Internet takes up a massive amount of electricity but we fail to recognize it as to most of us  a website is just a website. 
Bitcoin's mining has a purpose and that's securing the blockchain. Google runs more servers than Facebook and they still have a purpose and that's access to information. Bitcoin is access to money. 
The constantly rising difficulty means that old hardware for Bitcoin must be abandoned and that new more efficient ASICs must then be developed and deployed. Bitcoin mining is in a constant race to make ASICs faster and more energy efficient as well as cheaper. The electrical cost of 1 Ghash today is far less than a year ago. 
The energy thing isn't specific to Bitcoin. It's a global problem and it's solved by using renewable energy. Not by stopping the use of Bitcoin or singling it out to save polar bears but instead using wind, solar, and hydro to run a mining operation and all servers that make up the infrastructure of the Internet to be renewable.

With TAILS the OS still has knowledge of your real IP. The OS just seeks to route traffic of apps through TOR. I'm not experienced with TAILS I believe this is just based on setting the apps proxy settings to TOR. This means installing other apps and if they are miss configured you get a leak. Whonix in the other hand is entirely sandboxes. It runs two VMs, one VM runs TOR and a connects to your network and creates a local TOR proxy (the gateway). The gateway has two network adapts your NAT and a virtualized integral network. The other VM (workstation) is only connected to a virtualized internal network. This means the OS of the workstation (or any other VM configured to the same internal network) is entirely sandboxes to TOR so every app is forced to use TOR and even malware would only get the IP of TOR. Configuring proxy settings in the workstation for apps is still used for stream isolation. Whonix devs have a port prepared for Bitcoin (you must install client and configure it). This means that a different circuit gets used for your Bitcoin wallet than does got browsing. I take it TAILS still implements stream isolation  though. 
Basically Whonix is better for anonymity and puts and end to IP leaks. TAILS however is better for forensics as it is amnesic and leaves no trace. Whonix saves your content. It also doesn't have encryption. This means you are reliant of the encryption of the host.

 In fact Silk Road actually was one of the sites with stricter rules in this regard. Child porn was banned, hit men banned, prostitution well no one needs the dark net for that. Silk Road even banned the sale of weapons (I forget if they banned fraud too but I think so). 
The site was intended to prevent harm not cause it.
Pretty much all of Silk Roads competitors (past and present) had no problem allowing the sale of weapons and ammunition. But Silk Road considered that too much. Child porn was/is banned on all darknet market places past and present for that matter. Even drug dealers and fraudsters consider that to be crossing the line.

Segwit (BIP141) requires 95% to lockin and average that over a window of about 2 week. 
This is very hard to get. So BIP91 was preposed that says if 80% signal BIP91 then after 2 days BIP 91 will lock in. This locked in. What this does is reject blocks that don't signal BIP141. This makes it so that miners are forced to signal BIP141 resulting in 100% signaling for it. So now BIP141 can lock in and Segwit actually activate.
All that was locked in was a whip to force abstaining miners to lockin Segwit.

So there's about 43% of blocks right now that are signaling Segwit (BIP141 I assume?). As it stands if this doesn't remain greater than 50% then there is a chain split. And BIP91 needs 80% to activate. Lets face it that won't happen in such a short time span.
But what happens if say BIP141 has 45% of the blocks mined and BIP91 say 20%. This would make it so the majority signal Segwit right? Would BIP148 still cause a chain split then or would it stop a chain split because majority signal Segwit (despite being different BIPs)?

If you have BTC in a wallet you control before the fork then yes you will have BCC. It has nothing to do with the wallet you use but the blockchain it's self. Electrum is just saying that they themselves won't support BCC. BCC is supposed to be coming out with a Electrum fork but it's not ready yet. 
What I'd suggest is put your Bitcoin in a Bitcoin Core wallet before the fork. Then after the fork you can transfer your Bitcoin back to Electrum. Bitcoin ABC has a fork of core currently. So then you can copy your old core wallet and open it up in BitcoinABC and it should pick up your BCC and since the BTC was already transferred out of that corresponding wallet then if there's a security flaw in BitcoinABC's core fork it can't steel your Bitcoin since it's then under different keys.

If government tries to regulate Bitcoin its self then of course it'd be like file sharing, it's decentralized so it cares not for government. But I think most governments are starting to figure out that any attempt to ban Bitcoin or regulate the network its self is in effective and few of them want to do so. At least not in free democratic countries. 
Thing is while regulating user is much like regulating pot and torrents (it just doesn't work), regulating exchanges and MSBs on the other hand are more like governments regulating banks, that tends to work (unless the banks get the upper hand and start regulating the government...)

Minimal increase. The difficulty adjust every 2016 blocks. This works out to be about 3 days time. Now if computing power increases to the point that the hash rate increases significantly before the difficulty adjusts then yes block times with be a bit quicker, however that means that since difficultly adjusts every 2016 blocks that the difficulty will then adjust sooner to return to the norm. There is no way that Bitcoin's hash rate could continually climb so rapidly for the difficulty adjustments to not be able to keep up.

Nah. I think it's more just FUD they want price to crash. Same thing like what happened with the BU related crash. Just FUD, and it worked.
Really what I think it's more about is that users don't have a say, miners do. That's the way Bitcoin was designed and a lot of users don't like that. So they have a knew jerk reaction to any moves that miners take and view it as a corporate take over of the community because their voice wasn't heard. This results in a bunch of hyperbolic statements. But that's the way Bitcoin was designed, it's for miners to decide what chain to secure and the market to incentive them to do so. Not what some guy on Reddit says. That's what Decred was made for not Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-07-22 19:27:27
Yeah but as long the vast majority still reject non Segwit blocks then a chainsplit will resolve it's self as longest chain wins. This is why it'll be extra important to wait for more confirmations than usually in the coming weeks. In case of reorganization. 
@_date: 2017-07-12 07:43:22
As I understand it Segwit doesn't actually give us 4 MB, it keeps it at 1 MB but takes the witness data out of the block its self freeing up space for more transactions within a 1 MB block making it so that it has a theoretical transaction capacity that would be comparable to a 4MB block. The reason for using Segwit is that it avoids a hard fork as it can be implemented as a soft fork. Additionally it does more beyond increasing on chain transactions. It upgrades the protocols and allows for things like the Lightning Network that would allow for it to scale far greater than any block size increase ever would. 
@_date: 2017-07-20 19:23:10
BitcoinABC was just Jiha's failed attempt to protest Segwit. He gave up.

In case if reorganization on the blockchain or if an attacker had enough hashrate to manipulate the next blocks, they wouldn't have enough however to manipulate the next 6 consecutive blocks so as a rule of thumb 6 is when it's irreversible. 
That said 6 was the old rule of thumb. Now the network is far more secure than it used to be and we typically consider 2-3 confirmations to be enough for the it be irreversible but 99.9% of the time just 1 confirmation is enough. 
@_date: 2017-07-21 03:45:13
Nah that's mostly just FUD. 
There is a legitimate concern of having very large blocks, and it is also reality that for Bitcoin to scale we do need things like LN because it's just not viable to have rapid on chain transactions because of bandwidth limitations of the internet it's self. Centralized systems are always faster because only one sever needs to process a transaction. With a decentralized systems all nodes must unanimously agree on a transaction. 
Anyhow any block size increase at all isn't exactly bad and is eventually needed because while Segwit and LN will be enough for now eventually they too will get bottlenecked. 
Nodes can handle twice the block size of now. Moors law applies it hard drives too. There's a risk that Segwit2x would lead to less people running nodes but there's solutions for these people such as pruning of the blockchain. We have to realize the average Bitcoin user doesn't run nodes they have someone else do it for them. Those who do can likely handle somewhat bigger block size. Especially facing the reality that they're eventually a necessity. 
A lot of people just don't want to fork because of the risks involved. But truthfully a hard fork for block size should of been done years ago. Satohsi only meant for the 1MB limit to be temporary anyways. But that didn't happen. It's better now to fork than to do it latter when Bitcoin is so much higher of a market cap and the risks are even bigger than today. Because it's a fact that if Bitcoin becomes mainstream that at some point bigger blocks are needed. 
@_date: 2017-07-20 20:56:31
If we leave the 2x part however then eventually Segwit and Lightning will get bottlenecked by block size. When that happens Bitcoin will be far higher if a market cap and we'll have this same debate again only far more contentious as the stakes will be far far greater.

No. For starters there is no key disclosure law in Canada. The controversy here is how the law says that when going through the border that border security has the right to search your belongings. Subsequently by broad interpretation this means that a password would need to be given so that they can search your phone. With no mention of passwords in the law the man in question who was asked and refused to give over password is challenging this in court. Something which has not perversely occurred in Canada. Still a password that is asked when spending Bitcoin isn't something that's needed to search for its existence.

If it reaches a sustained 80% before the end of the month then Segwit activates which avoids UASF causing a chainsplit. 
So basically the higher this number goes the more Bitcoin's price rises. If it activates Bitcoin's price rises even higher. If the percentage starts tending down though prices will start to crash. Don't be surprised if miners manipulate this to insider trade. Regardless of that it's that percentage increase that's making the whole crypto market rise and recover from recent crash.

Ross isn't being charged for murder in this case. All of those where dropped in federal court only one murder for higher charge sits in a Maryland court. That case is no on going. The prosecution right now is trying to paint the picture of Ross as a kingpin. They however are not trying to use these logs to try Ross for murder because he is not on trail for murder right now.

Well, Ripple is kind of decentralized in a sense (it's still a distributed ledger anyone can run a node for) it's just spearheaded by a central authority. Unlike Bitcoin it is a debt based currency. It's nodes on IOUs, unlike Bitcoin which isn't debt based like fiat. Ripple therefor isn't trustless like Bitcoin. There's plenty of reasons to hate it and like Bitcoin more but most of doesn't even know how Ripple actually works, quite frankly neither do I (fully).

There was never any Bitcoin related law just an amendment to anti money laundering laws saying that Bitcoin companies would now need to do KYC when applicable. Previously it was legal for Bitcoin companies to do no KYC in many circumstances and Bitcoin was not covered under existing antimoney laundering laws. Companies still practised AML/KYC where necessary for fear that Bitcoin would later fall under existing laws and/or various other reason (eg. so the banks will do business, fraud prevention).

For starters Bitcoin is irreversible. If a thief takes it now it's his. 
Bitcoin isn't anonymous, it's pseudonymous. You only know how much Bitcoin you have because you can trace it to the previous owner and know that he didn't fake it by tracing it back to the owner before that and then so on. There is however no KYC. As a result people can use tumblers/coin mixers to preform off chain transaction where they are swaping pseudonyms amongst various individuals to hide the path between A and B. 
Now tumblers will be effective at hiding the transactions of small amounts (relative to thefts that have occurred) but any large amount (few million dollars) can't be easily tumbled simply from there not being enough volume (the person looking to tumble as a result gets some of their own coins back). So this means massive amounts are easily traced. But with no KYC they can hide in the public without anyone knowing who the thief is. Then small amounts over time can be tumbled from this and later spent or hidden in different wallets. 
So small thefts are easy to hide large ones can still hide in public.

@_date: 2017-07-22 19:58:04
Yes it does. Bitcoin has 10 minutes confirmation times, Litecoin has 2.5 minute confirmation times. They both have the same block size but given reduced block time this means Litecoin is comparable to having a block size 4x as large as Bitcoin. 
So (especially if the 2x hard fork doesn't  happen) eventually Bitcoin will again reach a bottle neck and not be able to handle higher transaction capacity all the while Litecoin will. So it's not unreasonable to foresee a future in which Bitcoin is used more to hold value or buy more expensive items and Litecoin due to lower fees, higher transactions capacity and faster confirmation times is used for every day small purchases like a coffee. Then throw in atomic swaps with LN and someone could ask for Bitcoin and you send Litecoin but they receive Bitcoin. Or you send someone Bitcoin and they can receive it as Litecoin. So it'll be extremely easy to use both. 
@_date: 2017-07-16 01:16:02
Does it really make any difference? The blockchain is public. Whether you connect to these seed nodes or not doesn't much make a difference as they obtain the same information none the less. Anyone can data mine a public and open network.

That's not an accurate chart. Xbt.eu was only showing BU as a category of BU only blocks . They updated Segwit to show Segwit only and Segwit solo blocks. They didn't update their code to do this with BU.

Currently 43% are still signaling BU (Emergent Consensus) over the past 24h.

Electrum uses SSL when connecting to server. This prevents MITM, it's the same reason TOR Browser Bundle comes with HTTPS Everywhere installed (as malicious exit nodes preform MITM).

@_date: 2015-02-23 01:37:22
Easiest solution would be Whonix+Electrum in place of Tails if that amount anonymity is desired by you. An incognito live CD doesn't make things easier than a fully TORified VM that has no knowledge of non TOR IPs. 
What I'm getting at in previous comment is is why it's more anonymous to run a full node. It's anonymous because you download and relay all transactions. So when you pick out the balance of your own addresses no one node you downloaded from can tell what your address is because you have all of them. So it's fair ground to say any of them are yours therefore we don't know who you are . Now I don't know the effectiveness of MultiBit in terms of adding privacy. I don't know the code or how much from random addresses MultiBit downloads (so I can't vouge for its effectiveness specifically) but this approach is capable of adding privacy. I wouldn't call it a false illusion if implemented currently. If you have say 20 addresses with Bitcoin and now when you request info from a node you request for 300 address (280 of which are random and not yours) then since you continually are connecting to various different nodes then it's unlikely (possible but far reduced likelihood) that you will continually request the same 20 address of yours from the same node repeatedly then allowing the node to determine what address are yours. Especially if you are having a different address for change then your Bitcoin aren't continually using the same address to look up. Its not as good privacy as with TOR but it's most certainly a lot more privacy than none with the approach Electrum currently takes.

Nope it's not guaranteed yet. But because of UASF threatening to activate Segwit very soon  (based on the date rather than miner support) and that less than 50% of miners support this then it'll result in a chain split but if Segwit activates through Segwit2x then UASF doesn't have to do anything and we get Segwit by beginning of next month or sooner. Segwit2x has two parts part one activate Segwit part two double the block size through a hard fork. 
Since the market doesn't want a fork miners are hard-pressed to activate Segwit before UASF and since most miners don't want to use the current Segwit implementation but supper Segwit2x they're racing signal for it and and therefore activate Segwit before August 1st. Over 80% of blocks signal intent for BIP91 but currently only about 40% (and rising) signal that they have the code ready for it. So there's a high likelihood that from the pressure put on miners from UASF that the Segwit aspect  of Segwit2x will soon activate. If they fallow through in the block size hard fork well that's still completely up in the air.

Well in the sense of regulations sure. But that's far different from trying to obstruct the market economy it's not like east Germany with a bunch of price controls. Even then that's not really socialism either. 


Yep and Greece really screwed that one up. They imploded because they loved to have their cake and eat it too. Large welfare state and rampant tax invasion with little to no consequences resulting in revenue far too low to sustain the welfare state. 
Anyways having a welfare state isn't socialist. [In fact it's something many socialist are very critical of]( viewing it is a diminishment of the socialism movement and the outcome of socialist who have come to accept capitalism the moment they find it to be sufficiently humanised to their liking.  
[Wikipedia defines socialism quit well here.]( 


You see the socialist type of mentality is that if the people owned the means of production, every employee is therefore their own boss. There ends up being no elite capitalist class above them. With no boss above them to profit off of their labour they earn all of the wealth of which they produced. Therefore there is no income inequilty. So no welfare state and social safety nets  are needed rather everyone has enough money from the start, there isn't much disparity in wealth as no capitalist elite exist. So no need for a welfare state. 
Rather social programs is the outcome of taking capitalism and trying to do some patch work to redistribute wealth from those who are the capitalist elite to the bottom end of the scale. 
So long story short social programs aren't socialism. They are capitalism that if anything are influenced by a socialist desire for equality.

I was wondering this too. I think the reasoning is simply that Gyft would rather use BitPay. However they don't want to alienate themselves from Coinbase only users. Think, why does Netflix accept credit card but also take PayPal? Some people simply prefer using PayPal. So Gyft must acknowledge this and thus implement Coinbase but disable the ability to pay on-chain with it so that on-chain users pay with BitPay. Now no customers are lost. The reasoning for them favouring BitPay I'm not sure, it may very well be that BitPay charging 0% makes it much more favourable over CoinBase.

By being centralized it's truly an off-chain transaction (what's on-chain is mixed). Hopefully that describes the thought I intend to convey. The best solution is of course using multiple tumblers.

But if you have Bitcoin you'd need to pay a fee to send it to an exchange to buy Litecoin to the sell the Litecoin? Kind of pointless unless you make money off arbitrage.

How does it work with the NFC thing? I guess the idea is multi-sig to here the NFC chip holds a private key and signs the transaction in conjunction with the phone that holds an other key?  This way is phone is hacked Bitcoin can't be easily stolen as only one key is obtained. At least not if only data is compromised as having full control of the phone means you can ask NFC chip to sign transaction thus defeating the purpose. Unless there is a hardware limit on NFC. But really for the NFC thing to function  in that manner it needs to be a little computer on it as simply holding a private key isn't very secure as that means exposing the private key to the phone itself then defeating the security benefit. Unless the idea is simply that if someone steels your phone and that NFC thing is in your wallet when not in use then your Bitcoin is safe. 
The questions that keep me up at night.. 
Edit: didn't explain much in the site but it makes it sound like its not multi-sig and the key just is stored on the NFC tag. So this means that back up apps and what not don't expose your private key to being vulnerable however if full control of the phone is taken over by malicious software then having separate private key isn't very effective.

That's a good question because "regulations" can mean a million things. It's impossible to regulate Bitcoin its self, it is self regulating. But it's possible to regulate exchanges and digital currency services. 
For example an exchange can be regulated, laws may update KYC requirements. They could mandate cold storage for an exchange, they could mandate that exchanges don't operate fractional reserves, or a certain reserve requirement is met, they could regulate margin trading how much can be borrowed. They can also regulate tax specific policies for Bitcoin. 
I don't know any details of this legislation. But it's fair to say both good and bad can come of this, and likely a bit of both.

Well let's do some math. So they lost about $18-$19 million CAD.
* BTC/CAD trade volume:  580 BTC
* BTC/USD trade volume: 20 BTC
* ETH/BTC trade volume: 888 ETH
* ETH/CAD trade volume: 4081 ETH
* Fait trade fees: 0.5%
* ETH/BTC trade fees: 0.2%
* BTC price: $3500 CAD
* ETH price:  $320 CAD
 
\ 
    580 x 0.005 x 3500 x 365 = $3,704,750
    20 x 0.005 x 3500 x 365 = $127,750
    888 x 0.002 x 320 x 365 = $207,436
    4081 x 0.005  x 320 x 365 = $2,383,304
**Total estimated annual revenue:** $6,423,240
So they lost about 3 years of revenue. Ouch...
Mind you they probably get a good size stash of their own personal Bitcoin, Ether, and Ether classic that they never rewarded customers with all having increased substantially in value.

It's not about what they're allowed to use or not allowed to use. It's a matter of what's available to them.
If you read into it appears the issue is that BitPay lost their Canadian banking partner. So if you want to use Bitpay in Canada you'll no longer be able to receive funds in CAD and do an EFT to a CAD bank account. Rather funds would need to be obtained in USD and then a bank wire done to a Canadian account. Most banks will charge hefty fees for international bank wires, plus forex fees.
So Newegg pulled out of accepting Bitcoin in Canada because Bitpay can no longer offer them service for a good price. I guess they aren't much interested in recoding their site to sell off Bitcoin for CAD on Quadriga so they can then get an EFT for free to their bank account and receive CAD.
Still have no idea how this relates to my comment about government surveillance, checks and balances, and militarization of police...

Any financial institution will close an account for any suspicious activity. Cashing out $40k (16.5 BTC) in one day is one of those things that arises suspicion.  Coinbase has a knack for pulling the AML suspicion trigger a lot faster than other exchanges, or so it would appear.

It's the sellers that don't have a bank account. Marijuana in Colorado and Washington and I think now Alaska are legal and several other states have it legal for medical purposes. The thing is federal law in the US says it is illegal. Now banks must adhere to federal law. So company  in the US selling marijuana and putting those proceeds into a bank under federal law would be money laundering. Obama has said  that he won't go after the banks if they do business with the marijuana companies but well, he doesn't control the machine that is the American government and so until federal law changes the banks are too scared to touch marijuana. 
Now people say "if the business that has millions of dollars in revenue can't have a bank account and are forced to hold all that money and transact it all in cash they should use Bitcoin because Bitcoin circumvents the need for banks". At first though this is an adequate assessment as you no longer need to store large amounts of cash or have armed guards to protect that cash when you can store Bitcoin on a USB encrypted. Except for one thing. Customers all play in dollars and the business has bills to pay in Dollars. To move any large amount of Dollars in to Bitcoin or vice versa you need to use an exchange. But to transfer Dollars to/from an exchange you need a bank account. So it doesn't play out. So the whole Bitcoin solve the problems of no banks only holds ground if all customers pay in Bitcoin  and all operating expenses can also be paid in Bitcoin.

The thing is you require a lot of trust in those services to not go belly up. Of course you can achieve risk mitigation by using a combined of similar such services and you can also use exchanges for the same purpose. 
Still, this solves the volatility problem. It doesn't solve the bigger problem and that's getting  millions of dollars in cash into Bitcoin without a bank account and the getting all that Bitcoin back into dollars without the luxury of just doing a wire transfer to/from Bitstamp. If your solution to this is local Bitcoins well, that has a lot of fees and you have the government ready to slam the Bitcoin vendors and the marijuana sellers with money laundering charges for facilitating such high volume transactions. So unless everyone pays in Bitcoin to start then it doesn't help.

Also Vitalkin Buterin doesn't control Ethereum. You can't just call him and ask for your money back no more than how you can't just call the Bitcoin core team and do the same. Ethereum is still decentralized.
Now yes they forked as a result of the DAO hack. But it was just that a hard fork. It  only was possible for that to happen due to the consent of the blockchains miners. Some disagreed with the fork and continued to mine the original chain which still exists to this day as Ethereum Classic.
It was then the market that decided to support the fork over the original chain, not any central entity that made said change occur. Both chains coexist to this day, the market then values each as it deemed worthy.

Doesn't change that you're cherry picking data to conform to your views. Here's the article that has the chart you sited.  it actually argues that the world is safer today than in the past when looking at military conflicts. 
You (or who ever else copied that chart and edited it) drew a line through it and called it the mean... In order to accurately calculate the mean you'd need the data set. Given that the chart you presented me is the same as the one from the source but with a line drawn on top of it this then leads me to believe that it was by no means accurately calculated but rather arbitrarily drawn. 
You're talking about relative death of per 100,000 people in a particular conflict. This does not mean that the world is more deadly but that if the data is correct that in a conflict the rate of which people died increased.
 While that is still bad that doesn't proclaim that a higher relative rate of the world's population die in conflicts but rather that when conflicts did occur in contemporary times the relative death rate in the conflict zone had increased. This isn't much of a shocker given advancements in military hardware post industrial revolution as we saw in both world wars. But as it can see in the chart there are indeed other times of which the death rate was as high as in the world words.

We're saying it's incredibly stupid to suddenly take all of your diversified savings and put all eggs in one basket in the midst of a giant bull run with an inevitable extremely large correction on the horizon.
Putting all your eggs in on basket is never a good idea. That said I've been there and I've done that with Bitcoin (but only because I didn't have many eggs at the time) and I'll never look back. Paid off extremely well. But I did that when Bitcoin was between $100-800 in anticipation of markets like these. Not at the prices  we're seeing today. 
Buy low sell high. It's too high a risk to buy high hoping to sell higher when you're putting your life's savings on the line. If this guy had any sense of ration he'd only be putting a large fraction of his stock portfolio in Bitcoin. Not all of it.

You do realize that every Bitcoin exchange in the US has be be registered as a Money Service Business which requires transaction records to be logged and for transactions above $10k to be reported directly to FINCEN. 
Do you also realize that when the IRS wanted vast records of Coinbase users data Coinbase went straight to court to fight the IRS calling the demand to broad and over reaching. 
If you don't want  the US government knowing your transaction data then buy/sell you Bitcoin in cash. Even if you use an off shore exchange so transaction records aren't reported to the US if you ever withdraw any of this money to a US bank account then said US based bank will be an MSB as well and have the same reporting requirements that Coinbase. 
The only way to be completely private is Bitcoin direct to cash. Mind you I guess you could buy a USD Xapo card send it to a postal forwarding service in Canada (as US is I believe the only country Xapo doesn't serve) that then resends it to you in the US. Then I figure it'll still work on US ATMs and you can withdraw or purchase things and whole it's not fully anonymous it'll be far more anon than any US based business and won't be reporting to the US as they don't service that country (due to strict save the kids from terrorist money launder attitudes that are present in the US).

Mining costs electricity. If Bitcoin is worth too little then it becomes too expensive to mine with current hardware. So miners shut down. The difficulty drops. Now it gets to a point that miners can mine and make a profit. The thing is difficulty is now low and easy to attack. Especially if all this very powerful mining hardware was developed for the Golden days.

Even if core devs couldn't operate they don't control Bitcoin. Instead Bitcoin would exist as is now unchanged. Then anyone who intends will make a fork of the source code and we'd like see a few forks. Slowly  people would willingly choose which ones to use.

You don't need to be against an organized body elected by the public and helping the poor in order to object to said governing body abusing it's power and thus no longer serving it's mandate of helping the public but rather harming them.
Perhaps the solution isn't to object to the concept of government but rather to decentralize governing it's self and democratize it as much as possible. 
One does not need to be for outright anarchy in order to believe that cryptography is necessary to keep the government at bay. It's part of a system of checks and balances.

Accepting laundered money is. Now that doesn't mean the funds are laundered by any means. But they're anonymous so they have the potential to be. Particularly when the funds are used to defend someone who made  millions of dollars worth of Bitcoin from things that are illegal. 
Coinbase isn't going to put up a fight against the government when they get accused of being complicit in laundering money (either by the on the off chance that they accidentally are, or just the legal mess of the uncertainty from operating in a largely grey area of regulations they are in). They have quite a large history of closing accounts for any reason they fear they'd be a accused of accepting illegal funds. Even minor things like people withdrawing/depositing Bitcoin to/from gambling sites. 
It's not about whether or not it's illegal. It's about whether or not it has the potential to be, and Coinbase has no interest in putting up a fight against Uncle Sam to prove they've done nothing wrong.

Well for starters it is much more likely the first transaction is accepted, from my understanding that's what the miner is supposed to do. But it's not really a risk in your scenario. 
Let's say I go send it to one merchant then walk across the street and preform my hack, I then must manage to pull this off quick enough assuming I could do it on my phone, I may even need to do this "hack"  while paying the guy for my new coffee. Then I try to go send those sane bitcoins to the other merchant prior to 10 min passing. That merchant can monitor the network and see that I already sent it to the first guy as such the transaction wouldn't go though because he would refuse it knowing it was already spent. This can be written into software.

The prices are all pegged to fiat currency. Not sure about on classified ads sites. But for any company selling using a payment processor like bitpay they peg the value to USD.

Be aware that you don't need to use bitpay. 
Bitpay is a bitcoin payment processor they are awesome because you still have low fee and they convert to fiat right away to prevent from losses due to fluctuations in price and they also let u key a percentage in bitcoins. 
If though you see no need to convert straight to fiat and intend to do that your self then you do not need bitpay just a address for people to send it to and it will cost u absolutely 0 in fees. Week there is a price to converting to fiat on exchanges but with bitcoins, wait a day and it's worth enough to cover those fees

The protection things for the consumer doesn't really matter that much. 
Think if you use a credit card so buy something how is it that someone can steel that info and fraud you? They skim the card. But with bitcoin I scan your QR code then send you the money, you see my bitcoin address if you want but you can't use that to charge me. 
With a credit card a merchant is essentially withdrawing money from the buyer using the information stored on a credit card. With bitcoins a buyer is sending money directly to the vendor. No merchant who I bought from can ever fraud me, It becomes safer to buy from an untrusted vendor using bitcoins than with credit card.
Now this doesn't mean that as a consumer there aren't problems with hacking, if I don't secure my bitcoins a hacker can steel them and I can't get refunded by the bank. But any bitcoin enthusiast knows how to secure their coins and those are the people buyer from you.
As a merchant you have nothing to loose, it costs you less to accept than a credit card. With bitpay bitcoins can be exchanged immediately for dollars protecting you from volatility. As for the consumers you ask whats the benefit, does it really matter? you have a huge fan base for bitcoins, just look at this sub reddit. It doesn't matter if you wouldn't pay for things with bitcoins its that I will and you have nothing to lose from accepting it as payment form me.

It wouldn't be feasible, nearly all bitcoins would be tainted in one way or the other. Just like dollars.
90% of USD bills are tainted with cocain. There are not that many coke heads in America, but 90% of the US's physical currency is tainted with cocain! 
To go ahead and block out dirty bitcoins is impossible, either you trace all bitcoins which then means that a huge percentage couldn't be spent which would then make this clean coin system be discarded or you make it loosely enforced  meaning a coin mix will make the coins clean, in that case the system is entirely ineffective and only serves as a lie to add legitimacy to the currency.

Qt has what's knows as key pools. This is a privacy feature, the way bitcoin works you can't always send the amount you want. you may need to send more and then get change back (a process that is automated) a client can be made to send this change to the same address or a different one, being different it adds privacy. Qt does this with what's called key pools. change goes to a different address, by default there are 100 keys in this key pool so after 100 transactions it must be backed up again or any new change from transactions made after the initial back up will be lost. This default of 100 can be increased. 
So in short after 100 transactions make a back up. This is a feature that is nice but for others is a draw back, if you don't like it use a different client that doesn't have key pools and you will not need to make new back ups all the time.

I'll copy past my other comment here. Judging by users comments OP's post is about Gyft and that with Gyft the on-chain option for Coinbase isn't available.
I think the reasoning for both is simply that Gyft would rather use BitPay. However they don't want to alienate themselves from Coinbase only users. Think, why does Netflix accept credit card but also take PayPal? Some people simply prefer using PayPal. So Gyft must acknowledge this and thus implement Coinbase but disable the ability to pay on-chain with it so that on-chain users pay with BitPay. Now no customers are lost. The reasoning for them favouring BitPay I'm not sure, it may very well be that BitPay charging 0% per transaction makes it much more favourable over CoinBase.

Your out of luck without verification. You can still use localbitcoins to buy though.
when it comes to selling strait for fiat without verification quickly if you intend to withdraw it will not happen without verification. But most exchanges still let you trade without verification, just not withdraw. So if you buy on local bitcoins and you feel it will crash you then trade on gox or bitstamp and then hold it there in USD, when you feel the market has stabilized you then buy back for bitcoins at the now lower price and send those bitcoins to somewhere else where you exchange for fiat, which may also be local bitcoins in that case.

This should be a warning to all. Keep good anti-virus software installed. Don't download sketchy things. Encrypt everything with stronger password. I just transferred all my bitcoins to new wallet with 16 character password including symboles and numbers and mixed Cass.

It is by far the most detailed and best explanation. But to sum it up this clever use of technology allows for a currency controlled by no one, not government, not a company, no one. It is entirely decentralized,.  As such no funds can be frozen nothing can be done to stop funds from being  transfered and no governing body can say let's create more.

Coin validation is about creating a black list of coins that can't be used. Colour coins is about making a bitcoin, or much more likely a satoshi have a colour that will always have the colour so it can be traded like a stock... 
My self though while I think the idea is great I do see it maybe causing problems making things complicated for the end user and I wonder if it could be a problem with the discrepancy in wallet software used by people. Colour coins might just exist best on a alt coin to keep bitcoin pure. But I'm not really sure.

bitcoins are still bitcoins. dirty coins can go through dark wallet and/or mixing services to remove their rep as dirty and then they become mistery coins, if you will, that are flowing about in the clean bitconomy. Alternatively clean bitcoins could be bought from an exchange and those bitcoins could be attached to your name. You then run it though dark wallet and the link between you and them are removed. Dark wallet isn't a different crypto currency, Bitcoins are still Bitcoins Dark wallet is a technique to obscure the origin of ones bitcoins from the all seeing eyes of the blockchain.
On the other side of thing perhaps exchange rates could be different across exchanges as a result of regulation where the USA with highly regulated exchanges sees bitcoins at a different price than countries like Canada and China that may have more laxed bitcoin laws.

Did you have 2FA? Blockchain is pretty impressive security wise. You use 2FA and 2 passwords. Your normal log in one and then an other one for transfers. I must say I'm pretty impressed. 
It won't do anything to stop week passwords though. And if you aren't using the block chain chrome or Firefox add-on then I would think you risk possibly having browser add-ons steeling your info.

well look at how much the market crashed as a result. the crash occurs when the whale is forced to cater to the lower bids of buyers in order to cash out the desired volume. If you spread it out then there wouldn't be as much of a crash and therefore you don't need to cater to bids that are that much lower. As a result you make more money.
over all bitstamp isn't 100 bellow gox but definitely is below. Gox hit 900 first. Bitstamp and others where playing catch up would of probably hit 850ish. Just wouldn't cash out on btc-e which is always way lower.
Edit: things are wacky though right now, I've never seen btc-e have a price higher than bitstamp.

There are different types of wallets. Bitcoin Qt the original, downloads the entire block chain and redistributes it p2p style. It will consistently keep downloading. Other wallets take different approaches. Electrum as a desktop client accesses servers that already has it downloaded.  Multibit an other desktop client takes a bit of a hybrid approach where it doesn't download the whole block chain but only the parts relevant to you and therefore saves space and time to sync. These same approaches are taking on a phone because if not you would need to download massive amounts of data onto your phone which takes up Lots of space.
By having a server storing the block chain I believe their is the potential that it could be falsely reported on that server and would then make the balance in your wallet be manipulated. This wouldn't effect your actual balance as recognized by the real blockchain but it could certainly be a problem. To get around this problem the latest version of Electrum checks more than one server to get an accurate depiction of your balance.

Best to use Wallet on computer as it is more secure than phone. You would use phone to store only small amounts for practical purposes. Like when you need them. 
You need to back up your wallet so if file is corrupt or your device and is lost you can recover your bitcoins. Always encrypt your wallet with a password of 12 characters or more to prevent theft from malware. If using bitcoin Qt as a wallet you need to back up again after every 100 transactions due to key pools

Yes, they are great because of a backup procedure for if you lose your phone so you can get the keys back. (if you have back up enabled)  they also have a good procedure for if you lose your phone and from my understanding any back ups are encrypted with your password then uploaded so not even they can decrypt it.

Greece isn't a socialist country. They are a capitalist country. Left wing capitalism if you will. They're economy is still dominated by privately owned enterprise. That's not a socialist country. Socialism means the people own the means of production, in Greece the people do not. This isn't so say their capitalism hasn't been influenced by socialism or that there isn't socialist within the country, because there are. But they aren't a socialist country. 
It's  not no true Scotsman, it's about the definition of the world socialism. Just pointing out capitalism with social programs does not equal socialism.

To properly explain this it's all about a private key. It is the private key that holds all your bitcoins. It's essentially a randomly generated string of text that if acquired unlocks all bitcoins to its corresponding address aka public key. 
When you back up a wallet and encrypt it you are encrypting a copy of that private key. 
A paper wallet simply stores that private key on paper in the forum of a qr code. 
So the difference is that with a paper wallet all you need is the paper. If you right your password down a attacker needs access to your backed up file and the password which you wrote down. With a paper wallet all the attacker needs is your paper. 
Note that the paper wallet can also be encrypted with a password using bip 38. To sum it up this means if someone got the qr code they would need a password to make sense of what it says.

You have a private key and a Public key, your bitcoin address is you public key.
When sending a transaction the network knows that you are the true owner of that private key by creating a digital signature which is something that can only be created with a private key, a public key can then be compared to that signature to determine that the person who created that signature does indeed have access to the private key.
In other words a private key makes a digital signature and a public key is compared to that signature that can then prove only the private key corresponding to that public key was used to make the signature. 
Its hard to explain but it's easy to understand.

**Inevitably drug dealing gets brought up** It must be acknowledged that a tool can be abused. Hammers kill people but have legitimate uses. Dollars are used to sell drugs but have legit uses. 
**Tor** is the anonymizing software and network that runs most of the deep web. The place that drugs have been bought and sold with bitcoins. However most of the **TOR networks funding comes from the US government** as it has legitimate uses. The network fees those in repressive regimes from censor ship and allows them to communicate with the world. The network is used by journalist to report from tyrannical states and frees people from the threat of death for expressing their opinions. 
This network is also the network used to distribute *child porn, drugs, lethal weapons* and much more.
The moral of this is that the government continues to fund TOR because it has **legitimate** uses that far outweigh its negatives. I hope this can be recognized and be applied to bitcoins. Even though there may be some negatives it is far out weighted by the positives. 
This is not to say any negative should be ignored but please acknowledge that even if a government bands bitcoin it will not stop the bitcoin trade. Make the best of this and regulate appropriately.

Very responsible bankers.
For starters bitcoins only deflate in a certain sense of the word. Bitcoins keep being mined and the amount available keeps getting increased. Currently you are seeing 25 BTC be created every 10 minutes or so. This is due to mining. The max amount of bitcoins are capped at 21 million. Bitcoins are only deflationary in the sense that the demand continually grows in proportion to their availability. This is what we see now, this is why their price continually rises because as people learn about bitcoins more people want them. 
Bitcoins can also be deflationary in the sense that once 21 million are created any that are locked away by forgotten password can't be used and in essence are no longer in circulation. 
As for how loans would work, first we must look at how loans work now.
Banks currently use whats called fractional reserve banking which you may be aware of due to the question ask. Though for those who aren't, to sum it up what this means is everyone puts their money into a bank and then the bank gives that money out to people into the form of loans all the while saying that everyone has the same amount of money that was put into the bank. This creates inflation. The term is derived from how banks only have a fraction of what they should in their reserves.
So how would loans work in a bitcoin only economy? Full reserve banking. This would mean that banks would need to be very responsible. They would need to give out bitcoins that they do hold. Some of the profits generated from the interest of previous loans would then be given out. This would likely mean higher interest rates, though considering how bitcoins values would not decrease over time then the ease of buying other items would hopefully offset these costs.
How could this transilate into our world? It's possible that a loan issuer could give out bitcoins and then ask for the amount to be paid back in its value in proportion to fiat currency. Eg. I give you 100 BTC loan when 1 BTC = $300 and you pay back 10 BTC if 1 BTC = $3000, this could make lending far easier.

Someone could potentially double spend. But it is unlikely. 
They would basically send the bitcoins to one person, then make a hack that sends it back to them selves. The likely hood of this happening is slim as miners are suppose to accept the first payment. Only way it could have a chance of being sent to themselves is by sending it with a large fee. The network can also be monitored for double spending prior to confirmation blockchain.info does this. The person double spending would also need to preform his "attack" in under 10 min. For a merchant to sell a coffee it is extremely unlikely they would get jipped. For expensive purchases it might be worth wild to wait just encase. Also this waiting thing doesn't matter for online purchases.
Some would argue bitcoins 10 min wait time is to much, this is why litecoins have 2.5 min wait time meaning that to preform double spending it would need to be pulled off in under 2.5 min. Not very practical for an attacker who is drinking a coffee.
@_date: 2013-11-08 17:25:55
It's still hard to determine who has what amount of bitcoins and who doesn't. When owner ship has been transferred or hasn't. This renders threat of jail as something most people would blow off.

The thing is people will want a place to store their bitcoins securely. The idea of a bank isn't all bad. This is where coin kite comes in. 
They serve to play the role of a bitcoin bank but by using a sole address it adds transparency as anyone can look up on the block chain what is happening to the coins. This makes the banking process transparent enough to show that they are behaving responsibly. It still gives people the security of a bank but with citizen oversight under threat of taking your business to your self.

I'm not trying to advocate gold over bitcoin or say that bitcoin can not be used as a store of value.

If you can not use bitcoin in a practical way there will be no demand and thus no value you will just be holding 1s and 0s

don't think you'd be able to transfer bitcoins to fiat fast enough and then bye back. At the lowest. You could bye then But would need funds already in place.
You also have to realize that a crash is caused because you can not sell enough at 900 and are forced to sell rest to lower bids. So that loss is going to your self. So you would be selling a chuck at 700 and then be buying back at 700.
I think The only way a whale causing a crash can then rebuy back for less is to hope for a lot of panic sells. If your lowest sale was 700 and people panicked and sold for 500 then you could buy back at 500 and profit. But it would be quiet the game to pull it off.

Bitcoin solves s problem that credit cards don't. No one would buy a $20000 car up front with a credit card, and due to charge backs no dealership should want to accept them. 
Plenty of people would love to buy a car up front with no financing though, especially for a cheap Honda. Buy carrying around that much cash is a problem and risk. 
Bitcoin is fast secure irreversible transaction easier to send than credit card with less risk of fraud. solves a problem for merchant and buyer. Especially if buyer made money off of investing.

Bitcoin isn't stock. Your comparing apples and oranges here. We don't trade some stock at Walmart do we? Its currency. There is over 1 trillion USD in circulation. That is the closest thing to a global currency. And that number doesn't even sound right when the US has a debt of over 17 trillion. Its improbable but fair to assume that if bitcoin becomes the world's reserve currency a market cap like that is suitable. 
We also must take into account that there are a lot of bitcoins that are not in circulation also, they have been forgotten, wallets that have been deleted. 
Sure it's unlikely but could still happen. Bitcoins are not stock and I hate that people keep treating it as such.

It is considered mostly safe due to the way it works. The private key is decrypted in the browser using javascript. The server does not know the private key. 
However there are weaknesses, one scenario  is the site is hacked and the javascript is changed so the decrypted keys are sent to the attacker. The other may be a browser add on is stealing it.
To make this safer they have their own addon for chrome and firefox so if the server was compromised the keys would not be leaked.
They offer many optional but important security features including 2FA.
People have in the past gotten coins stolen though. 
Personally I would not trust it for large amounts of coins but only use it for the convenience for small amounts I would like to have easily accessible. Especially on my phone.

Black listing coins says we  have an external list that says this bitcoin is allowed this one is not. This stops you from being able to buy stuff and makes it so the person maintaining the list controls which coins are valid. 
Colour coin does not invalidated any coin. It's taking small amounts, a satoshi and giving it an attribute that makes it coloured. This doesn't mean an actual colour more like this is a stock for my company. This satoshi that was otherwise worthless is now able to be traded as a stock and frees us from centralized stock exchanges. Sure you would need to go into a exchange to trade that stock but you can then withdraw it. Have it secure even if exchange shuts down which has been a problem in the past for bitcoin stock exchanges. 
It is stock accessible to everyone and just like a bitcoin you can send it easily and no one can stop you. It's like a bitcoin inside a bitcoin in a sense. 
It's more of an experimental idea though and I'm not sure how well it would play out.

I was looking for a quote Joe Rogan has throw around but I can't find it. 
So to paraphrase *what we need is a revolution of consciousness.*
The problem isn't about how we think it is about how the world thinks. About how your country thinks.
The biggest secrets are the open secrets and we are in a world that doesn't stress them. The news would rather talk about Kim kardashian or the Royal wedding when babies are being blow up by drones and the US government fights to keep it a secret. 
Its great if this sub reddit agrees with you. But the world isn't on reddit. The day the digital natives take over. The people who don't trust the "Man"  but are used to looking things up for them selves. The day they take over the world is what gives me hope.

The power that the creation of the USD gives to government to finance war is largely the cause of anti-American terrorism. 
Removing that power, removing obama from blowing up babies with drones. Bitcoin limits economic hit men and banks from screwing over 3rd world countries which in turn creates a violent hatred of the west by some people in that country. Bitcoin has the ability to create fair distribution of wealth removing poverty from terrorist riding places which then removes peoples desire to "fight" for what they dream to be their freedom. 
In short, Bitcoin may very well have the power to stop terrorism. Not cause it.

I wish i bought a bunch of bitcoins when I was 15.
There is a lot to talk about with bitcoin. My advice look at the monetarty system to start with, expose it's obserdity then propose bitcoin as a solution. I did this for my class. Could maybe give you the PowerPoint if you need. 
In essence the short way of explaining bitcoin. It is a currency regulated by no one but much rather a predictable algorithm. The integrity of this algorithm is maintained by the users of the system. To change this protocol the majority of users would need to agree to it. In short dollars are ruled by banks but bitcoins are ruled by the people they empower. 
What country are you in, I know a few films that could help explain the banking system depending on where you live.

Wouldn't be able to transfer to fiat fast enough and then bye back. At the lowest. You could But would need funds already in place. 
You also have to realize that a crash is caused because you can not sell enough at 900 and are forced to sell rest to lower bids. So that loss is going to your self. So you would be selling a chuck at 700 and then be buying back at 700. 
I think The only way a whale causing a crash can then rebuy back for less is to hope for a lot of panic sells. If your lowest sale was 700 and people panicked and sold for 500 then you could buy back at 500 and profit. But it would be quiet the game to pull it off. 
@_date: 2013-11-12 06:03:05
What I explained previously is more on the technical side of things. 
When you send bitcoins to an address your private key is not exposed due to the signatures used. It's something about cryptography you don't really need to understand. It's not something you need to create it's something that's taken care of automatically by the network and your wallet. 
In essence making a transaction does not expose your private key, if it did the whole bitcoin protocal would not be functional. You can send as many transactions you want from the same wallet and it will not expose your private key. 
You do however need to keep your private key secure so people can't steal it and get at your bitcoins, this would happen from viruses and hackers. You will want to encrypt it so even if it is copied by an attacker they can't unlock it and spend your bitcoins without your password.
 A wallet is a application that stores your private key and let's you manage the funds on it. 
Blockchain.info offers multiple services one is to view transactions made these transactions you see are all public keys aka your bitcoin address. When you transfer funds it will show up there and can be traced to an other address unless you take certain privacy mesures but it does not expose your private key. 
Your private key is like a key to your safe if you give it to someone they have all your bitcoins. 
Blockchain.info also offers a Web wallet, it's different than other web wallets so it's more secure but over all to keep your bitcoins secure you should not trust a Web wallet, they have been hacked in the past and bitcoins have been lost. 
Many Web wallets store your private key on their servers and have the ability to decrypt them. Blockchain.info is different but still not as secure as a desktop client. 
You will want to download a wallet onto your computer and encrypt that wallet with a strong password. Make sure your computer has anti virus. There are also other mesures to make your wallet more secure like paper wallets and cold storage, though this is mostly for the paranoid. 
@_date: 2013-12-12 07:00:01
I'm not going to say that there isn't any elegance to Windows phone. But must apps on it don't seem all to great looking. Trying to conform to the metro interface doesn't always work out. I see plenty more functional more beautiful apps on other platforms. 
I haven't used your app but saw over view on YouTube. Looking at that vs my Android wallet it's not something all to move looking, doesn't look as functional or straight forward.
None the less I hope you can get this working good. I would really like to see a wallet on all platforms and Windows is probably 3rd in line on mobile. Keep up the work. But as a user who has tried coinbase or even the other Android wallets. I don't think I could last a day on a Windows phone bitcoin wallet 
@_date: 2013-11-18 22:34:35
Ya if you transfer all funds to armory from bitcoins it will show 0 in virtex because you transfer the money. Bitcoin would be ineffective if there was no transfer. 
And Ya what you have in your virtex account is basically a shared wallet. So one or a few bitcoin wallets hold all users bitcoins and you have permission to a few of them. If you transfer to armory then they will be stored in a wallet you are in full control of. 
The reason to put in armory or an other bitcoin client is that you don't really want to trust a website with your money you would hopefully be more secure if your bitcoins are stored on your computer. Think if virtex got hacked you could lose your bitcoins. If they decided to run off with them they could. If you have good enough security practices then it would be more secure to store your bitcoin on your computer. 
An analogy commonly used is that putting your money in an online wallet is like handing your wallet filled with few thousand cash to a stranger and saying here keep this safe for me. But really wouldn't you rather trust your self to keep that money safe? 
If it's on your computer though this does make security your responsibility. Got to have good anti virus, don't download sketchy things. Got to protect from key loggers and hackers. If you are really paranoid you'll use cold storage. This is a computer that is never connected to the Internet abs hopefully never was. This keeps it safe from viruses. 
Also make lots of back ups and make sure those back ups are encrypted with a strong password. If you loose the wallet file you will lose all your money you need to be sure if a file is corrupt, if your hard drive fails or house burns down that you will still have a back up of that wallet. You want a strong password so if someone steels that back up file be it someone who stole your computer or  hacker that your bitcoins can not be spent because you have a good password on it. 
I know this is a long reply but security is of the essence. PS I love Cavirtex.

yes it would allow you to encrypt the printed key with a password.
also from my understanding bip38 is still a new encryption technology which while looking very promising it hasn't been around long enough to fully prove itself. Generating paper wallets should be done offline as a site could steal the key. This is unlikly of a trusted site such is bitaddress.org but could still happen.

Coinkite looks promising. They are currently in beta but they intend to offer secure storage for people who feel the way you do. Though it is a paid service so either you pay a monthly fee or a percentage per transaction. 
It's all up to you bitcoin is still developing for the mainstream but if you are holding a lot of bitcoins I definitely would recommend you start learning. Or at least give it a shot.
Its not that hard to encrypt your wallet and then back it up. you just need to remember your strong password (mixed case 12+ character with numbers and hopefully symbols.)
If you are paranoid about viruses then use cold storage. Buy a cheap computer that you never connect to the internet or use an old one and put your bitcoins on there. You do not need to connect a wallet to the internet to receive bitcoins. Only to spend them.
there are plenty of threads on security. google stuff dude.

Butterfly labs took pre-orders for this about a year plus ago. It costs 22 grand. Only probably shipped around now. 
To put this in perspective Kncminer currently sells a miner of 550 GH/s for 5 grand. With the rate bitcoin difficulty increases that likely won't make a profit though if bitcoin prices increase and it ships at right time. It may pay its self off. But if you had it today it would make you a profit. 
Lesson is don't expect to make money off a miner unless you are going to hold all your bitcoins and expect to see the value skyrocket. In essence bitcoin mining is an arms race. 
Litecoin on the other hand is designed In a way to make it harder for difficulty to increase rapidly due to the cost it would take to pay for a miner. As such some people feel litecoin could over throw bitcoin.

That's why people started using it yes. But that doesn't mean that with ASICs litecoin has no purpose. Because scrypt is relient on memory and SHA-256 isn't scrypt means more cost is required to up the hash rate than with bitcoin a ASIC, so a litecoin ASIC could hold its value better than a bitcoin one which will quickly be obsolete. This can help to secure a network more as more miners stay in the game and mining isn't run solely by early adopters. 
Read the IEEE article it explains this concept better. Then argue me.

**This does harm to bitcoin.**
Not everyone is going to use new addresses all the time when bitcoin goes mainstream. By app means encourage it, okay. But don't prohibit reuse. Think about someone accepting donations and they put a address on their Web page, like the pirate Bay for example.  This hurts them. 
Last I hear they where overhauling part of the bitcoin protocol so that stuff could be sent to all the same address and still identify the user. This would mean bitpay wouldn't need a new address for every purchase. 
And does this mean only don't reuse and address to receive or does this effect sending from the same address?

It's only easier to a certain extent. One would think just have them all in one file and back that up. But with Qt you still need to make new back ups from time to time. When you add a new address of course and after every 100 transactions due to key pools or risk losing your change. With Multibit it does not use key pools so you solved that problem. And each time you make a new address you would think to back it up. So in that sense it could be argued in Multibit it is easier. 
Qt combing it is nice though as it displays balance of all adresses all together. 
Edit: separate files are nice as it means separate passwords which is good for security purposes. Think of it as a chequeings account and saving.

Show us something credible 
@_date: 2013-12-25 09:35:51
First you would need to bribe a pool because you won't find any miners with enough hash power. 
Second you don't control which miners verify a block. So you could try bribing the biggest pool and hope that they solve the block and the next 5 in a row for that standard 6 confirmations to be confirmed . Which is extremely unlikely but has happened in the past (BTC Guild solved 7 in a row once) 
Third, the pool doesn't control if people mine with them. If miners start seeing a pool do this they would switch pools. 
You would need to have secretive connections with the pool operators and with a few different pools to accomplish this and then hope that none of the miners which support them find out. It's a unlikely possibility and the pool operators have more to lose from it than to gain.

Silk road shut down did little to stop that drug trade and it just popped back up. It's capability to exist is due to one of the important freedoms that bitcoin offers. The independence from tyrannical government. Some times for better or for worse. 
However, while silk road's self regulating safety to the drug market is a good thing, it's shut down prooves two important things. 1 is that bitcoin price isn't dependant on it. 2 it showed that while bitcoin can be used to circumvent gouvernent it does not make it impervious to the law. Undoubtedly bad things can be done with dollars and they will be done with bitcoins and any currency for that matter. 
Showing bitcoin is not impervious to government power no matter how tyrannical it may be proves that it's ability to do illegal things can not be used as an argument against bitcoin. Especially when people think that their perfect fiat currency is never used for illegal things. Oh no.

It has faster block time, 2.5 min for verification. While this smaller block time does mean it is easier for an attacker to manipulate it doesn't scale up that way. So 1 block bitcoin block solved is more secure (10 min to solve) than 1 block litecoin (2.5 min to solve) but 10 ltc blocks verified is more secure than 10 btc blocks verified or something like that. I'm not sure the math of how it scales but it has been explained to me. This means less risk of double spending prior to blocks being solved, important for brick and mortar merchants. [Watch this]( 
There will be 84 million litecoins max as oposed to BTC's 21
The big change is scrypt algorythum instead of SHA-256. Scrypt is memory intensive. At the moment there are no ASICS for it LTC is still mined by GPUs. When ASICs come out due to the demand for ram from Scrypt GPUs will be able to compete more fairly againsts ASICs. This algorithm in theory stops litecoin difficulty from been able to rise as fast as bitcoin making an investment in mining more likely to pay off and therefore meaning more people take part and network is more secure.

But all means is easier to make a loan in  a world with inflation. We like will never see a world without any inflation for fiat. 
Though the example I have would mean paying back bitcoins + interest based on their value relative to fiat. This would make it easier to pay back and make a profit for the lender. Though yes perhaps he would just be better off holding the coins in that case abs making larger profits. It would ask be a bet as to how much will bitcoins value rise vs how much interest could I charge. 
In a world where bitcoin is the only currency you would not have to worry about this rapid increase in value and as such money can still be lent out just with out as much ease and it would take time before one could gain enough wealth to do so. For example right now I can lend you $50 and say you pay me back $60, I still made a profit and didn't need to print money to do so. Though if u wanted 100 grand I could not a complicated that until having profit from several previous loans of which I am willing to give out some of that profit with interest

I'd have to think having a currency like CYN being traded for bitcoins might make the price less volatile
Think if one bitcoin goes for 300 USD and one person bids 301, the next 302, and then it drops to 299 that's not a huge difference but it is significantly larger of a difference that  2650 CYN to 2651 to 2652 to 2649. That has to do something psychological to buyers and sellers no?

51% attack and double spending are 2 different things. You need 0% hashing power to perform double spending. 
51% means the attacker controls most of the network and can therefore dictate what the blockchain says. Who has what amount of bitcoins, who doesn't, he would also likely be able to change the rules so it's no longer 21 million bitcoins. 
Double spending means send the coins to one address then to an other. A confirmation stops this from happening. Once it is confirmed it can not be sent somewhere else without lots of computing power. If you send it to a store and then to your self with a higher fee there is the chance that you gets your coins back, this is double spending. This is why confirmations are required.
