assets =/= monetary

Yes it has. If you even bothered looking it up before replying you could have easily found the answer.
Developed countries or cities experience:
Higher life expectancy.
Higher women life expectancy.
Higher water quality.
Lower unemployment rate(rural highest).
Lower smoking rates.
Higher access to health care.
Higher access to education.
The list goes on.

"I don't want to talk about it".
That's it. Unless your friend or relatives are assholes and actually respect you as a human being, they won't and dwell in any further.

$500k investment =/= $500k income.
Your salary have to be appropriate to your company's job title. If you're claimed to be a partner or CEO, you can't be expect to be paid $20k, paying close to nothing in self-employment tax while claiming the rest of profit in dividend.
You salary should be at least $50-100k in this case.

I came here to say this. If his scheme really works, there wouldn't be so many rich people complaining about paying too much tax.
Your salary have to be "reasonable", same goes for living expense deductible(housing), car(transportation), etc....
If you made 500k that very year and pay yourself only $20k, you're in a very very big trouble.

We outsource jobs to 3rd world country because they're low value jobs.
Why do people hire maids to do chores when they could do it themselves? Because it's cheaper than doing it themselves. If you make $100/hr and maid cost only $20/hr, it'd make more economical sense to spend your free time working or enjoying life rather than working.
Corporations outsource low value jobs so they can have more profit to hire more valuable, irreplaceable employees. Or simply return these profits to their shareholders.

Nobody care if you use it to buy sandwich.
If you use it to buy assets and sell said assets to fiat and expect to pay no tax, you're just laundering money.
Make it big enough, for ex buying house or business, and you're going to need a very good tax attorney.

Wat? You mean more unemployment and downgrade of quality of life.

No. They're also dependent on your imports. They can't keep up current growth without 1st worlds buying their products.

I'm running an online businesses in US and have talked to several CPAs and know many people in similar situation.


No, but if you're making $500k to $1mm and pay 90% of them in form of dividend, you're asking for trouble since it's clear that you're doing so to prevent paying 10% self-employment tax.
It's very ignorance of you to assume that every first world country follows the same logic, even making the same rules/regulations based on said set of logic.
What's next, are you going to claim that US citizen doesn't have to pay tax on income that they make outside of US?

Such delusional. Consumerism is what make America one of countries with highest GDP per capita to date. Sustainable domestic consumption is what make one country prospers, not "living modestly".
Consumption drives efficiency, innovation, creating wealth and lift up the whole society's economy as a whole.

Just because you're depressed doesn't mean others aren't happy.
Stop projecting.

That's the problem. The main features of Fiat currency is its manufactured inflation.
If my $100 will worth less next year, I'd be more inclined to spend it more productively. Either buy consumption(foods, clothes) or invest in some kind of ventures that produce positive returns outpacing my saving rates(which is currently very low).
