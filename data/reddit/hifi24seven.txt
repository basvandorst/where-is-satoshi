Depends on how much you're spending.  ��
@_date: 2019-11-24 07:22:29
Anytime you purchase BTC through a centralized exchange that has your personal information, that transaction can be easily associated with your personal identity through blockchain analysis. Every time a transaction takes place, it leaves a permanent record on the blockchain in order to verify how much  was sent from one address to another and to prevent double spending of coins. There is an entire industry built around monitoring these transactions, many of which work with government agencies to assist with investigations of criminal behavior by compiling and analyzing the data to provide a statistical likelihood that a given sending or receiving address belongs to a particular person. 
Chainalysis is one such group. Several criminal organizations operating on the dark web have been caught this way by mistakenly thinking that BTC is anonymous when it's merely pseudonymous. In all honesty though, I wouldn't worry about any of this unless you're doing something that you shouldn't be doing. If you're like most people and just want to maintain a higher degree of privacy and security with your finances then there are plenty of ways to do so with BTC purchased from centralized exchanges (coinjoins, tumblers, etc.), or you can just buy P2P if you'd rather stay off the radar entirely - dealer's choice.

It's just another term for coin control, which is a way of keeping tracking of your UTxO's based on where they came from. For example, if you're using something like Wasabi Wallet and have coins that you have run through a Coinjoin or tumbler or that you have transferred from a decentralized P2P exchange, you wouldn't want to mix up those coins with those purchased from a centralized exchange like Coinbase because the anonymity would be lost the moment they are associated with one another. By separating your UTxO's with labels, it's akin to having mini-wallets inside of you main wallet so that you can keep track of what's anonymous and what's not to help you manage your privacy more effectively.

That's very kind of you, thanks!

Nothing to be ashamed of - it's confusing stuff, and many of us (myself included) are still learning how it all works. Here's a simple guide that explains it far better than I ever could if you'd like to understand it better and see some basic analogies:
@_date: 2019-11-24 03:23:41
P2P exchanges like Bisq often do not have much liquidity or at current market prices (especially when the market is crashing and you're looking for a quick buy on cheap coins), so places like "ConBase" are often the only option. That's what Wasabi Coinjoins,  JoinMarket, and Morphtoken + Monero are for. It's not hard to anonymize Bitcoin purchased from a centralized exchange "if you know how to use it and you're not a moron."
@_date: 2019-11-24 04:44:31
An unspent transaction output is the output of a transaction that a user receives and is able to spend in the future. This is what your wallet actually holds - Bitcoin represented as UTXO's. Wallets like Wasabi allow you to organize your funds with labels attached to each receiving address that identify where the UTXO's came from to help you separate the coins that are anonymous from those that are not.

Much appreciated guys, thanks for the tips. ��

I don't disagree with your sentiment at all, I'm just stating the law in the context of the other poster's insinuation that anonymizing your Bitcoin is illegal, which it's not. Committing tax fraud is what's illegal, and my point what's that there are several legitimate reasons for anonymizing your holdings that don't violate state or federal law.
@_date: 2019-11-24 04:01:09
There is nothing illegal about anonymizing your bitcoin holdings to increase your privacy as long as you are reporting your capital gains on your tax return when you sell for profit. Whether it be to increase your safety when shopping online or to protect yourself and your family from unscrupulous individuals who would attempt to track you and threaten harm if you don't surrender your credentials, anonymity is not just a right it's a necessity in the modern era. Now, whether or not people are using those services to commit tax fraud is something I cannot attest to and is certainly not something I would ever condone, but the gentleman you're addressing with that snarky little comment never mentioned anything along those lines that I'm aware of.

True, though I think you'd be hard-pressed to find any similarities between someone who was born in the early 80's when parents still spanked their kids for talking back and some soy eating twit born in 1994 that wears Che Guevara T-Shirts and who came of age in a world filled with cry closets and safe spaces everywhere because they were never taught to handle any adversity in their life. Generation labels are stupid, and Mr. 1980 will be fine during the next recession - it's Mr. 1994 that'll be moving back in with Mom and Dad (assuming they ever left, that is).

\ Seems unlikely, given that it came straight from the official website and PGP signatures check out, but I suppose anything's possible.
\ That's neither helpful nor particularly accurate (nor does it answer my question with any level of objectivity), but you are certainly entitled to your opinion. I may just VM and sandbox the app for the time being until I find a better solution.

I understand the risks of trading P2P and am not going to overextend myself, and a bisq sounds like they do a good job of securing each trade to minimize the risk of loss so I'm not worried about small investments under $200. I just found the trojan virus warning a bit unsettling because bisq is going to have access to my financial information, and that's a very different kind of risk with regards to loss potential. In other words, I'm not worried about my trading peer running off with my hundred dollars, I'm worried about a virus stealing my bank account information and trying to initiate a $20,000 wire transfer to its programmer. I think in the meantime I'll probably just sandbox the app inside a virtual machine until I'm more comfortable with it, and will likely use a dedicated checking account with a much smaller balance that isn't linked to my larger accounts and will try to insulate that behind zelle or MoneyGram for to keep my actual account numbers private.

I still wouldn't consider someone in their mid 30's to be part of that detested generation. Those born near the cutoff (1994) are the ones who have defined the term "millennial" as it's used today to reference the cry baby generation. 
Generation labels are asinine because they associate people who are too far apart in age to have anything in common with one another (especially these days with the massive shift in culture that we're seeing). The average 35 year old has about as much in common with a 25 year old as a 25 year old does with a 15 year old. 
One is working full-time raising a family, paying taxes, and dealing with the hardships of real life while the other is parading around college campuses years after they've already graduated while protesting about "toxic masculinity" and championing the merits of communism. ��

What strange is that I already have Tor browser on my computer and neither Webroot nor Malwarebytes had any issues with it. Even stranger is the fact that webroot has no problems when scanning the installation file, but as soon as the application is actually executed it gets flagged.
@_date: 2019-10-05 06:18:36
Any idea why Webroot thinks it's a trojan virus? Also, do you have any recommendations for things to look out for with a P2P trading platform like this? My understanding is that Bisq forces both parties to fund the trade to help mitigate scams and that all trades are multi-sig signed with an arbitrator in case problems arise, but beyond limiting my payment methods to those that don't directly expose my bank account info and only dealing with peers in the same country, what else can I do to protect myself?
@_date: 2019-12-26 22:23:55


It seemed to me that you were implying there wasn't much difference between it's actual origins and the other poster's concerns about it being developed by the NSA (which it most certainly was not), and that because of its origins, a backdoor could be around the corner any day (which is highly improbable considering that the tor code is open source and publicly audited). If that's not what you meant to imply or I misconstrued your post then by all means, please do elaborate.
@_date: 2019-12-26 04:09:25
The concept was created by a couple of guys working there at the time as a way to better encrypt  communications - that's a far cry from being "developed by the NSA" to spy on people. I'm not saying it doesn't raise any concerns or that the NSA isn't controlling certain exit nodes to try to do just that, but it's kind of hard to slip a backdoor into open source code that's under constant scrutiny by millions of people. Regardless, if any of the three letter agencies have decided you're a person of interest and wants to find something out about you, they have unlimited resources to do so and the remote possibility of being connected to a tor exit node that's under surveillance should be the least of your concerns at that point. Tor is just one of many tools that when implemented correctly can afford you some additional privacy - it's not a guarantee of anything, and I would hope that the people using it are smart enough to realize that.
@_date: 2019-12-24 03:16:26
A KYC exchange would have no way of knowing what type of wallet a random address came from, as there's no difference in the type of seed and derived key pairs from a Wasabi wallet when compared with any other wallet. What you are referring to are the supposed claims that using the coinjoin feature (which is completely optional) will result in those coins getting blacklisted from exchanges, which I don't believe is true but if it is, I've never personally encountered that with Coinbase - they've always been happy to take my coins in the rare event that I decide to sell and am in so much of a hurry that I don't have time to wait for a Bisq offer to be accepted. I honestly wouldn't worry about that given how many people use Wasabi and how few have *supposedly* encountered those issues, but if you're really that concerned then just don't put your utxo's through any coinjoins - you'll still benefit from the other privacy features you get with wasabi (coin control, Tor routing, no xpub leaking, etc.). ��
@_date: 2019-12-24 19:14:38
Glad to help. Just be aware that you cannot enqueue coins from a hardware wallet in a coinjoin (this is an optional feature in Wasabi used to anonymize your coins by mixing them with other people's in a joined transaction). To use the coinjoin feature, you'll need to first setup a Wasabi soft wallet, transfer the desired coins from your hardware wallet, enqueue the coins, and then transfer back to your hardware wallet when done. Make sure to include the resulting anonymity set in your hardware wallet's receiving address label as that information is not retained during the transfer. If you'd like additional info, the following how-to video series covers pretty much everything, though you can always refer to the official guide @ wasabiwallet.io for more help. ��

Hype in anticipation of scarcity driving the price up is not equivalent to the actual effects of that scarcity on price once it's occurred. You can't price in scarcity that does not yet exist in the marketplace because there's no way to know for certain what the actual values will be in the future and how that will affect trading patterns. You are right that the market price at any given time is the sum of all information, but past events don't predict future events and we don't know for sure if BTC will cost 40-50k+ within a couple years after the next halving. If we did, than the current prices would be exponentially higher than they are now. Given its deflationary nature due to its constant reduction in supply every four years, value increase is all but certain but there's no way to predict the numbers and when/at what rate they will occur. As with all things, only time will tell...

What does /24 do? The guide from [ provides an example of [127.0.0.1/32]( which worked in my case - why the difference?
@_date: 2019-12-23 23:27:19
A fair assessment, though security and privacy are two very different things, and while your funds may indeed be safe on a ledger or trezor, that doesn't stop their software from leaking your xpub to 3rd party severs and linking all your transactions together. If you don't want to run a full node but still care about privacy, I recommend you give wasabi wallet a look. It routes everything through tor, doesn't leak xpub, and supports hardware wallet integration. If you're using a Ledger, just make sure you setup a separate pin with attached passphrase for use exclusively with Wasabi and NEVER use that pin to check your balance on Ledger Live or the jig is up. ��
@_date: 2019-12-19 04:50:00
Also, just in case anyone else happens to have a maxuploadtarget specified in their bitcoin.conf, I found that I had to remove that field for bisq to connect reliably to my node. Unless it was purely coincidental, I imagine that bisq was maxing that value out and could be longer reconnect, which had me puzzled for quite a while until I thought to remove it for testing. I hope this little tidbit of knowledge finds its way to a fellow doofus out there struggling to get bisq to play nice with their node. ��

So in bitcoin, a member of project mayhem has a name?
@_date: 2019-12-24 06:51:04
It simply means accessing your hardware wallet through the Wasabi interface, which means that your funds are all still stored on the hardware wallet and use the addresses derived from its seed (not those generated by a Wasabi soft wallet). This allows you to maintain the security advantages of using a hardware wallet while utilizing the benefits of the Wasabi interface, which means the transactions are routed through tor and your extended public key (xpub) is not leaked to a third-party server in the process (associating every transaction ever made in that wallet in the process). Many light clients support this type of integration with hardware wallets (trezor and ledger being the most commonly supported), so this feature isn't unique to Wasabi, but the privacy features are what matter here. You can achieve similar results with Electrum + Bitcoin-Core + Electrum Personal Server when properly configured.

Kind of big ones to get wrong though, bud. When you fuck up that bad, no amount of past success can save you from your due criticism, and Paul's partisan political views and cluelessness about technology will only further relegate him to irrelevance as the modern era continues to rush past him. Nobody wins 'em all, you're right, but perhaps it's time to finally hang up the keys. ��
@_date: 2019-12-03 04:56:53
Well, there are lots of available resources here in the community to help get you started, so you're in the right place. if you don't mind dealing with a centralized exchange and paying higher fees, Coinbase and Coinbase Pro are good places to start as a beginner, and you can always look into LocalBitcoins or Bisq if you'd like to go the P2P route. Now's the time to get in though, because the price is expected to go up quite a bit after May when the next halving occurs. Get it now while it's still [comparatively] cheap!

@_date: 2019-12-24 00:53:57
Developed by? No. Potentially spied on by controlling certain exit nodes? Probably. Our government has financial and technical resources far beyond anything at our disposal, and they have the law on their side which they can bend to their will on a moment's notice to do damn near whatever they please. All any of us plebs can do is make an effort to protect ourselves using the resources that we have available to us and hope for the best.

I didn't read your other posts yet, but it sounds like we're on the same page. Personally, I use a VPN behind Tor for redundancy AND run my own node (configured accordingly), but I also don't do anything illegal. If the government is really that interested in my private life, they'll surely be able to find whatever it is they're looking for but will have to invest actual man-hours to do so and will only be left feeling disappointed with they find: a law-abiding citizen who simply doesn't appreciate unwarranted scrutiny of his private life. ;)
