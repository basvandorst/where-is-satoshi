I would add that promotion is important, but a merchant would be delusional if they expected significant, sustained btc traffic due to the infancy of the project alone.

I was referring to the uncertainty sorrunding btc.
Nasdaq, nyse, paypal, etc are all investigating if they can utilize blockchain tech, optimally without bitcoin.
Obviously things have improved but:
- the userbase is still panicky
- the plebs are still alienated
- Regulatory uncertainty is still a thing everywhere.

The profitability of miners is not priority as it depends on factors outside of the scope of the protocol.
Considering that bitcoin is still in the bootstrapping phase and the subsidy, fees shouldn't be a priority for a few more halvings at least.

well, a miniscule progress can be observed at last. 
One cannot trust a system with lack of transparency and flawed incentives. It is foolish to believe that a fundamentally flawed system can produce any honest options for you to vote on.
Even if we hypothesize a legit party and victory, due to the mentioned flaws (coupled with the flaws of each human acting in the system, most notably greed) their operation cannot be trusted.


 
It's not about rejecting politics, but creating a new framework which provides transparency and even playing field for the participants.


Nobody exists exclusively in a "virtual"/"all digital" world and anonymity is more about protection against all hostile entities (including but not exclusively the .gov).
Also, the main reason things shift to digital is efficiency.

I think it's crucial to ponder the primary client base of WU, which is people on the lower levels of the fiat pyramid, so not exactly the target audience for bitcoin currently.
He misses the fact that bitcoin is not static and does not require the infrastructure WU profits from (offices everywhere globally, basically well connectedness to the needy).
I find his reasoning about the regulatory expenses appearing "on the blockchain" wrong. If adoption continues, then the fiat gateways to btc gradually lose importance (less regulatory grip), the point of p2p systems is that there is no parasitic overlords.
As much as p2p filesharing wasn't affected by laws, regulations and lobbying, I cannot see p2p money affected much either long term.

It would be a huge hit, but it can survive. There is already a core audience which will maintain and use the network regardless of regulations and valuation.

I agree with your sentiment and if you cared to check my comment history then it would be clear that I'm amazed by the progress as well.
It doesn't change the fact that bitcoin is still uncertain and the plebs do not trust it or can't even comprehend it yet, not to mention the technical obstacles yet to overcome or even surface. We are still far away from critical mass.
The VC funding, and other developments won't neccessarily cause demand or make bitcoin adopted (which is undeniably a measure of progress and success).

Don't be that binary. Holders and spenders and even speculators are equally important. Most people who save also spend it time to time.
The main reason most people do not spend that much currently is the depressed price and you can't really fault holders for that.
Also, at this stage one of the factors for the depressed prices is the merchants themselves as most do not transact in btc, but convert to fiat.
Time, continuous development and user adoption can solve these only.

Be careful with private sales, only deal with people with excellent reputation. 
Some ATMs are 2 way, check if there's one close to you (check their fees before you sell if you find one).
Alternatively, You could register at the most suitable exchange for your country. Verification can take multiple days + it takes a lot of time for the fiat withdrawals to process (can be several days).
@_date: 2014-02-16 07:16:23
You have it backwards. Demand drives the value up nothing else.
The price is based on buyers and sellers on the markets.
If a lot of bitcoins are being offered filling the buy orders all the way down then the price moves down. 
If the ask orders "dictate" the market then the price moves up.
I don't see it falling to be honest. there was a correction from 800 to 600ish, but nothing extraordinary.
Gox is not functional so the price there is not representative.

FUCK BARCLAYS!
I have got an unauthorized charge on my card 2 months ago, I have contacted these fuckers (bank) and they have denied the chargeback. I ended up asking them to deny all future charges to my card from that company.
Fast forward to yesterday, I checked my statement - and what a surprise - the same company charged again, even though there weren't any active recurring payments. 
I called the bank (from abroad) and I spent 35 minutes on the line in total to get it resolved.
To top the experience, they let me know that they have blocked my card a day before that (for no apparent reason), so 15 minutes was spent on reactivating my card.
I don't care if takes 2, 15 or more years but I want to see these archaic, obsolete and flawed institutions to die completely.

No, other currencies lose value over time (inflation) and fluctuations are quite common, even rapid declines.


Stability comes with better coin distribution. It won't be easy and it takes a lot of time.


Even internet adoption has a lot of room to grow so it's evident that it will take a lot of time for bitcoin to mature.
Today, most people have a hard time grasping the concept. It's analogous to the appearance of TV/radio/internet. 
I do not think that it will stay as a niche because bitcoin is beneficial for everyone.
At the beginning I was too concerned by the volatility but not anymore. there were times when 50%+ intraday fluctuations were common. The progress is quite amazing in my opinion.

Newly minted coins are only a small part of the bitcoins exchanged on the markets.
Pegging the number of released coins to the value would ruin mining.
Price instability at this stage is nothing to be afraid of. It's completely natural.
If coin distribution and adoption will be better, then the price won't fluctuate this much.

I have used intersango, Mtgox and forums for exchanging at that time. (both exchanges died since then)
While they didn't require any KYC/AML, their service was very unstable, unreliable so I would say it was a lot harder to trade with confidence.

Coinbase offers a wallet but it's not ideal for storing btc as it functions like a bank (you don't have control over your funds) If you buy btc there I would advise that you transfer it out to a wallet which you have exclusive access.
Blockchain.info is ok, as they don't have access to your private keys and it's newbie friendly.

While I agree with your sentiment (certain entities in finance acknowledging the threat), I think you overestimate the intelligence of the average person.
They have no original thoughts, they hear something in the most popular (state/bank controlled) media (or the opinion of their closest authoritative figure) and parrot it without background information or without trying to form their own opinion.
Just look at the posts this demographic creates in A recent example: "I bought bitcoin, but someone said that it's going to lose its value. What do I do now"?
This is how they operate.
This combined with the following points
- influence of bankers and politicians
- not full internet adoption
- very bad economic data
- very skewed wealth distribution

While I agree with your opinion that taxes fund the most evil organizations and causes on the planet, I also understand a lot of people are paying because of fear of punishment.
I find it ridiculous that the government expects complete transparency from it's citizens but they operate in the shadows using illegal means and they do not have any respect towards the very people they leech on.
Optimally everyone should stop paying taxes globally and form new transparent entities for representing the interest of the public.
Considering how stupid people are I'm afraid this won't happen in my lifetime.
If the current system would be reformed to operate transparently I would be even happy with that too. (it won't happen though...it has less chance than people waking up and creating something new)

By the time you can input your pin, a bitcoin payment is already sent.
I agree that payment processors (obviously) make bitcoin integration/processing easier.
From a merchant's perspective, I think it's more appealing that there are several payment processors competing with each other compared to the select few card processors which enjoy monopoly globally, have very high fees, require special hardware and have little to no flexibility.

You are right that gold is less volatile, but it has other downsides too. If you want to sell it quickly then your only options are ripoffs (much below market price).
Hard to compare really, I wouldn't keep more than 5-10% of wealth in physical gold.
Paper gold is completely out of the question.


It's good to see that some people don't fall for the rubbish spread in bitcoin circles. It was annoying to see that even news sources have fallen for that nonsense.

If there will be "legal" trouble, then it affects all crypto's equally.

You have a misconception.

Credit cards use a pull model, bitcoin is push.
That means you don't have to send and keep crucial data at third parties when you pay.
Bitcoin provides a lot more efficient way of transacting and lowly credit card rewards seem to be pathetic when it comes to the advantages of the bitcoin network.
Also if you had bitcoin for a while and the purchasing power of them grew it makes a lot more sense to spend them compared to exchanging them.

It's not replacing "lost" money.


People trust them with their money. I'm not sure what's hard to comprehend. 
I don't trust banks hence I don't keep fiat in banks only what I have to.


I think your understanding of a safe place will significantly change in the coming years.
At the end of the day it comes down to trust. Do you really trust the banks and politicians?

It only depends on the community behind it. If people won't do anything other than watching meaningless charts then crypto currencies can be restricted to a point where it's completely barred from the legitimate financial services.
I strongly believe that bitcoin is a lot more than a bunch of speculators, but a critical mass is needed to withstand the forces working against it.
While I understand that you cannot "kill" it by making it illegal but it would render it useless for the average person.
This will be an important year...

Gold vs Bitcoin is an interesting topic.
I own both and think that they will complement each other.
Owning gold is basically hedging against a complete collapse in which utilities will be rendered offline for long periods of time. (In that case weapons, ammo, food, water and shelter will be a lot more important than money)
For this reason, I wouldn't allocate much to it as everything is a hassle when it comes to gold, such as testing, selling, storing, transferring. And the degree of inconvenience is proportional to the amount you own.
Also, gold cannot be verified openly, so it's very easy to manipulate it's value, which shouldn't be an issue with bitcoin long term.

Have you considered that keeping the markets under pressure could be done by a single "rich" individual at this stage?
Decentralized crypto currencies piss off the most powerful circles on the planet. All the central banks and prominent scumbags of the banking world and their sockpuppets were hostile towards this system.
The average person who buys bitcoin is driven by greed and think only short term. 
The current downtrend is already annoying for some of them (no wonder demand is low on the markets), can you imagine how many people would continue to hold when we crash below 300?
I have seen the markets crash from $31 to 6, from 266 to sub 80. People fled like parasites from a dead host.

Reddit is a small part of the crypto world and quite irrelevant at that (if you want worthwhile conversations or information, it's the worst place to go).
I don't think that going by the number of subscribers to those subreddits is a smart thing. it's not representative. Check the doge subreddit after a few years. ;-)
I have an IT company accepting bitcoin as I said. Would I accept doge? No, because it's unprofessional.
Doge might stick around as a currency for idiots/youth but I don't think that it's image would be appealing to the wider crowd.
I wouldn't buy anything at a shop where I would be greeted with the already boring doge theme...it's just awkward in my opinion.

The author's opinion on bitcoin. The pyramid scheme argument have been debunked so many times I'm not sure if it's even worth to discuss.


Right now it’s nothing more than a pyramid scheme getting rich those who entered first and taking money from all the suckers that are getting late in the game.
If that’s not a pyramid scheme please enlighten me.
Further, it’s not fullfilling its role of currency since only idiots would trade them for goods when the expectactions are that bitcoin value will increase in time. It’s called deflation and Japan experienced it to great pain.
Bitcoin is a pathetic alternative designed to suck money out of greedy suckers. You have just to pain attention to the other tons of digital currencies showing up like mushrooms to do the same.

Make no mistake, he as an individual has no effect whatsoever. I find that bitcoin is well designed in that regard.  (considering his hashrate, his attitude is quite pathetic).
Considering the amount of ASIC miners ordered the network is still in the hands of ordinary people.
If the bitcoin community degrades to a bunch of opportunistic idiots without a sufficient number of people who appreciate the blockchain then it will collapse in value and the userbase will shrink. If a pool controls most of the network it will be completely evident and will drive away users so everyone has the incentive to play nice.
Bitcoin mining exploits greed and turns it into "security".
As for 51% attacks...it's not that easy to execute and miners have a huge incentive to leave the pool as soon as it approaches owning majority of  the network.
It's all about common sense. Bigger pool, more hash mean more "luck" but it also means that the reward is very miniscule after splitting it up between the users.
I have been mining for a few years now, and I found that in the grand scheme of things it doesn't matter if you go with the biggest pool or not.
I had equal mining power pointed at pools with different sizes and I found that there were no differences in rewards on a wider timeframe (6months) whatsoever.

Mining is a good idea if:

Besides pool fees/merged mining/tx fees there aren't much difference between pools.
If you go with a smaller pool your rewards will be bigger but the frequency lower.
If you go with a bigger pool then rewards will be more frequent but your share of the pie will be much smaller.
As luck varies, you cannot compare which pool is better by examining 24hour periods.

Paypal could integrate bitcoin and exploit its properties, so they are not necessarily in direct competition.

3.) buy btc for a lot of $
4.) watch the price recover
5.) dump

While it couldn't destroy btc, it's good for a number of things:
1.) Makes a lot of $ for the attacker

I'm a bit confused.
If you and me trust each other and want to transact, then a shared database of transactions and balances still doesn't mean anything. Nothing moves. You won't give me anything other than an useless IOU.
To make the actual transaction to happen we need to decide what system we want to use. Among other options there are banking, bitcoin, paypal, etc.
In the majority of scenarios bitcoin would be cheaper and more efficient.
If the parties are so close that they use the same backend, then it's not really moving money, merely agreeing on a private ledger.

Historically it was always better to buy btc and hodl if profits were important to you.
Even buying btc is risky (growth is not guaranteed), with mining you have a lot more risk factors and hassle added.
Considering the ever growing difficulty in the past 1-2 years I don't think starting mining is a good bet now.

@_date: 2014-10-27 21:05:34
I'll try my best with a simple explanation:
Bitcoin is a digital money system without the need for an issuer or authority, this is one of the reasons it's valuable in the first place.
It's basically an accounting ledger and set of rules which all participants have to abide to participate in the system.
It exists on a global network of nodes (computers) sharing this accounting ledger.
BTC has value because people decided that it's worth something.
To comprehend this, think of seashells, one of the primitive forms of money. They are worthless by themselves, but people assigned value to them to make trade easier and more efficient.
When it comes to bitcoin, I think the first trade was 10000BTC for 1 or 2 pizzas.
It is not being created purely from nothing (air). It takes energy and hardware to maintain the network and to allow bitcoins to be created.

Are you new? Mining was always like this. For the majority of miners selling btc as soon as you mined them never really made sense. It's worth to revisit mining threads from 2011-2012.
The exchange rate cannot be predicted so it's an uncertainty from the very beginning.
If you mine it's like buying btc but you pay in the form of:
- Mining hardware
- Electricity
- Related expenses (shipping, customs, etc) 
Historically it was always better to buy btc directly compared to mining.
@_date: 2014-09-09 05:22:35
I disagree.full on anonymity is only a dream. as soon as you need to buy something physical you basically broadcast that you have/had/are involved with xy (anon) coin.
There are already laws in a lot of places that will grant you a nice prison sentence for not cooperating with the authorities (denying giving up password, or information)
I find bitcoin to be perfect in its pseudo-anonym nature.
if it wouldn't be perfect then nobody could use it on sr or nobody could steal it (mind the incentive for less anonymity).

The core audience of bitcoin (the ones who are not in it for possible fiat profits) will not settle for anything centrally managed. Obviously, bitcoin can remain small, but if you worry about it being mainstream especially quickly, then I think you're in for the wrong reason.

Don't worry, I don't think that you will lose money.
MTgox had plenty of opportunities to screw the users and they have recovered many times from more serious problems (hacks, seizure of funds, etc).
I know that it's frustrating if you cannot do anything but waiting. Try to focus on other things for the time being.

Paypal represents a very valuable network of merchants and consumers.
I could see bitpay competing in this space but they are still small and would be bought by PP/ebay sooner or later in my opinion.
Circle is worth mentioning as well, but it's still vapourware and they made the mistake of hyping their product prematurely (desperate attempt to get funding maybe?).
I for one wouldn't use paypal even if they integrated btc, but I understand that the average people are too dumb to handle btc directly or without "safety nets".

Using bitcoin, the currency does not stop innovation. I believe it's the contrary actually, it allows permissionless innovation.
The mainstream adoption doesn't need to happen quickly and generations which don't have any clue about tech will fade away anyways.
I agree that using and securing bitcoin requires some willingness to learn and intelligence but at this stage it's not a weakness but a strength.
Bitcoin needs developers, innovators, entrepreneurs and risk tolerant individuals not the mainstream public.
Even if we consider the niche use cases it has an amazing potential.

It really depends on the amount and your goals.
My approach is the following:

- low to med. amounts, spending, short term storage (bitcoin-core)
- long term savings for higher amounts, dedicated laptop, paperwallets

Firstly, back up your wallet if you haven't done so already and install the latest core client (new qt).

What OS are you using? If windows, then make sure you have antivirus **and** antimalware like malwarebytes.org.


Because it's quite straightforward.
1.) Download client
2.) Install
3.) Wait for syncing with the blockchain (based on your connection, it can take a lot of time)
4.) Encrypt wallet
5.) **Backup wallet.dat**
6.) Done


The blockchain is the "essence" of bitcoin. It's about 20GB of download atm (mind games are much bigger than that nowadays)
There's a torrent,  to speed up the download.
After you installed it, you can generate receiving addresses (for receiving btc) and send bitcoins through the send option.

Firstly, miners don't solve useless math problems. This misconception appeared in 2011 in msm.
Secondly, miners confirm transactions, without them, bitcoins would be easily "counterfeited", the whole system would stop functioning.

I'll try to answer:


1.) register on an exchange (research which one is the most suitable for you)
2.) Verify your account (Sending of scanned recent ID and proof of address documents are needed)
3.) Wire money to the exchange (fee depends on your bank)
4.) Buy btc (create bid orders at your desired price - if the order fills, the fee of the exchange is deducted automatically, meanwhile your funds on the exchange is credited to the sellers exchange account)
5.) withdraw bitcoin to your wallet (0.0001 is the current fee, it's around $0.062 now)


Cost varies from exchange to exchange and bank to bank.
Maybe the cheapest is to find a local seller (same country) who has reasonable rates.

In my opinion the easiest and cheapest way to fight against btc is through price manipulation.
Considering that most newbies seek fiat profits when they get familiar with bitcoin, I feel it is very easy to drive away people.
The Bank of England stated that bitcoin is not a threat while it's small. 
Dimon voiced his concerns that bitcoin (devs) aims to take their "lunch".
Logic dictates that one should deal with potential threats before it's too late. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure it out that the later they act the more expensive and harder it is to fight it.
I strongly believe that these circles will do everything to keep the prices low and to break uptrends.

This is a common misunderstanding.
Since the GPU days mining has a significant barrier of entry. 
The exchange rate was only a fraction of today's rate and the network has been quickly flooded with GPU farms.
Currently the same barrier of entry exists but the maintenance requirements are lower (essentially ASICs are p'n'p).
As for security, bitcoin were vulnerable to CPU/GPU botnets back then so ASICs improved a lot in that regard.
The latest tech is on 14nm which will bring considerable efficiency improvements to the mining scene yet again. (maybe in 1-2 years)
If you check old threads from 2011-2013 people were always complaining that it doesn't make sense as a hobby or newbies shouldn't start mining.
The small time miners are still out there btw ( like me :) )

Volatility is all about sub par distribution of coins nothing more. 
If distribution gets better and adoption continues then it will be less volatile. (crashes and rallies pave this way)
Historically it didn't affect long term users negatively and it's not surprising that it will take many years for the ecosystem to mature.
In my experience it certainly got a lot better in the past 3 years (in all aspects) and I see no reason why wouldn't it improve more in the future.
It's all about risk tolerance if you have no utility for it. While btc has it's own risks you cannot lose more money than your input (no leverage) so it has a place in every portfolio in my opinion.

Scams happen easily in paypal or credit card world too. People forget that every single customer pays the price of "insurance"....nothing is free.
BTW, this safety net works in only a part of the cases. For example, I've ran into hidden renewals with blizzard, and non functioning product on steam, but the bank didn't want to help with the charge back.
Based on my experience I rather have irreversible transfers and proper merchant reputation and market regulation than the current system which is a fail on so many levels.
I guess one cannot expect much though, most people are quite advanced when it comes to shifting responsibility.

Paypal provides reversible transfers. It's very risky to use it for selling btc.

I would keep those bitcoins for the time being. Don't forget that the infrastructure and services are being built.

I just ask politely if they have considered implementing it. I think there's no need for selling or persuasion.
Once I have asked scan.co.uk in 2011 if they thought about it. At that time they have refused the idea straight away but they started to accept it this year.
It's not really surprising as there weren't anything like bitcoin before so it takes a lot of time to build up trust.
In my opinion the number of enquiries is more important. If companies see that a lot of people are interested paying in BTC then it's quite evident that they'll support it.

Just for a second, imagine if you have 1 million coins and you see the exchange rate hit **$1** not to mention what happened afterwards.
I sense an amazing amount of satoshi envy in your attitude.


Bitcoin was always like this. You hear about it, and decide if it worths your time or not (I find it very funny that you happen to decided that bitcoin is worth your time to spend on hating and trolling).
Bitcoin grew out of that very platform, and again anyone could have joined. Obviously, most people have the attitude of the average buttcoiner and rejected the idea as the average person rejects it now (even in early 2011).
A premine is completely different as in that case creators intentionally take an advantage before release.
Bitcoin was released and mined afterwards and those coins have not even been liquidated so far.
Your level of butthurtness is amazing.

I had to use chargeback 3 times:
1.) Blizzard: charge back failed, as "I accepted the recurring charge" even though it was hidden.
2.) Stolen debit card details 1: ended up with a loss of $45 due to a fee, very long phone calls to the bank and the expense of posting documents to the bank.
3.) Stolen debit card details 2: suffered a loss of $30 after getting the money back.
When your cards are compromised the banks block your cards as soon as you call them to avoid further losses. Nice feature of the system if you are abroad. :)

They could, but they would destroy their own business. What would be the point in doing so?


This is the biggest BS concern. AML / KYC has nothing to do with bitcoin. I'm not sure what the author fantasized. Banks and governments won't step aside and let it just evolve.
Anyone is free to trade p2p through services like mycelium trader, localbitcoins, forums, and hopefully Open bazaar soon.
If you transact in bitcoin you're free, same as before.


In the early stages bitcoin accepting places are crucial, I cannot think of anyone who helped businesses getting on board more than the payment processors.


Transactions cost 0.0001. The investment what the miners input is completely irrelevant. the network works the same with thousands of ASICs or a handful of GPU rigs.


Says who? Everyone is free to use it as they please.

Gold is not accepted anywhere as money at the moment (because it's inefficient to be money). 
I don't agree that faith or beliefs (basically trust) don't have any role in valuing something. Mind, I'm not saying that it's based purely on beliefs.

Not really. If you need something you buy it. it's that simple. 
You could postpone your IT hardware or car purchases indefinitely if you realize that by waiting a bit, the same amount or less money provides better specs. You still buy a car, a smartphone, tablets, laptops and computers, because you need them now.
These are part of the essential consumption, including utilities, shelter and food. If you are able to postpone a purchase for a considerate time then it's irrelevant anyways.


Once you have the chance of transacting in btc, you could realize how efficient it is compared to the old and centralized systems.
Whenever I have to use the old ways, my brain hurts because of all the hassle and inconvenience involved thinking that it could be faster, more secure and cheaper with btc.


You are talking about speculators, who are part of the users, but I think their presence is way overrated.

I think it's correct for the US too.

4. You pay taxes on your gains in $ ( in this example on the 50% gain)

It's like comparing apples and oranges.
It's true that the network couldn't be attacked even if you allocate the top 500 supercomputers to bitcoin mining, due to efficiency differences between a purpose built chip and general use CPUs/GPUs.

In my view credit and debit cards are flawed concepts. Anybody can pull money from you after getting their hands on the needed info (which is very easy to get). 
I dislike to use them, and I also dislike the fact that by using these services I have to abandon control over my own money.
I don't like that a number of people have insight to my financial activity without me knowing that and additionally giving my card to the merchant/waiter my name/organization becomes visible.
Services provided by banks or any central authorities are expensive and inefficient. Moving and storing money would be a lot cheaper with bitcoin and I find spending it a lot more convenient. 
Be it online or "real" I prefer to use bitcoin.

I couldn't care less about what the average "consumer" think of bitcoin. They don't even know what they are talking about. 


Consumer protection is a product. It has nothing to do with bitcoin itself.


Progress? Patience? 


Volatility is completely natural at this stage and it will be volatile for many years to come. lately it has been improving a lot.


right...Paypal shouldn't even be compared to bitcoin. It's like apples and oranges. Paypal could implement bitcoin and offer insurance and chargebacks too (offchain).


Bitcoin was never anonymous by default or without additional procedures.

1.) Circle, buy btc
2.) Send btc to relatives circle account/wallet
3.) Relative decides to use btc or to cash out.
*involves volatility and 3rd party risks, and about 5-10% fees if the relative can use btc, then less.
@_date: 2014-11-19 23:15:51
The main thing about bitcoin is if you exclusively control your private key, then nobody but you have access to the btc.
By storing btc with companies like circle, coinbase and exchanges, you basically give up control over your funds, and as long as your funds are in the company's account, you don't have btc but an IOU (a promise that they will let you withdraw your funds)
I like the dedicated laptop approach, because I have easy access to my btc, without the need for bothering with paper wallets, while still being fairly secure.
Every additional software that your PC runs, is a possible source of a security hole.

Most people who believe the deflationary fairy tale don't recognize that the inflationary, debt based, centralized models are responsible for the shit we are in including the unsustainable consumption based economy, the concept of never ending growth (or growth at all costs) and the past 100 years of continuous banker wars.

People often think falsely that  the current chargeback solutions are some kind of always working safety nets. In reality, it costs money both directly and indirectly, furthermore it does not work in every scenario.
Also, If you had started asking for chargebacks frequently then the bank would terminate your account.

1. It's confirmation time not transaction time. This "(non)issue" has been debated over and over, search on forums for discussions.
2. Same as up until now, it's profitable for some and not for others. People will decide to stop, or start mining. Difficulty is adjusting at every 2016 blocks.
3. check scalability on the wiki and the insight of the current developers - again it has been discussed a thousand times

1.) Locate the stuff you want to buy
2.) Follow the checkout process, select btc as payment option
3.) You will be displayed a QR code (address) and amount to pay
4.) open your wallet, copy&amp;paste or scan the bitcoin address given
5.) Copy paste or specify amount

There are ways to get bitcoin without dealing with third parties (meatspace, forums, social media), and there are decentralized exchange projects already in the works too.


This is an extreme scenario implying that every exchange operates in the same country. Centralized exchanges tend to be in different jurisdictions. The Mtgox failure was severe because that was the first significant one and competition only just formed. Since then a lot of them appeared and if one goes down the others take it's place.


If bitshares will be starting to get adopted, then you can be sure that BTS will be highly volatile. The whole notion of expecting a new decentralized currency to be stable is nonsense. BTS already suffered a crash as I've seen.


In the meantime I have found the answers, so never mind.
I think, there needs to be proper guides, documentation and explanations. I have checked the bitshares forums and discussions and the community is very tiny and the resources are lacking. Pumping it as a functional system is quite premature.

It depends on the number users who agree to transact exclusively in bitcoin. The less users use it the less impact it will have.
It would require a micronation, a single welcoming country, city or community (be it online or "offline") to embrace it.

Saying that there's no interest in bitcoin accepting places is just plainly a lie. (I run a bitcoin accepting business too)
I think it's completely apparent that it's a lot easier and more convenient to realize profits (or losses for that matter) by buying products or services directly with bitcoin compared to using exchanges.
While I agree that adoption just began and you might not able to obtain some products for bitcoin but the improvement in this field is just amazing ,especially in the past year.
Another example, a few months back there were no reputable places to buy IT hardware in the UK, now we have scan.co.uk and aria.co.uk too.
I and many other bitcoiners prefer to use bitcoin. overstock have published their numbers and considering the infancy of the currency it's quite respectable. (around $1M sales in ~2 months).

First and foremost it's not bad luck, but bad decisions (made by you).
First you need to understand that you are the one who is responsible for the outcome of your decisions.


Have you thought about putting him to sleep? I have a dog which I'm fond of, but thousands spent on a doge vet is ~~idiotic~~ not realistic.


Again, an error on your part. It's not an investment...it's speculation.
Seeking financial advice from strangers on the internet is not the best idea either (it's also idiotic), but I wish you all the best, hope you can get over the problems you face.

- Find a job
- Cut back on your spending (spend only on essentials)

- Relax and exercise daily

In person:

2.) scan QR code, enter amount done.
As for not spending because of it's deflationary, that's the biggest nonsense coming from people who're brainwashed by the propaganda.
It encourages responsible spending but won't make anyone stop spending. If you need something you will buy it regardless of future exchange rates.

Everything involves risks, so everything can be considered gambling.
While bitcoin has it's own risks, you can only lose the money you have spent on them. (contrary to assets with leverage, so it's better for the average person).
If I would have bought BTC instead of a miner with cointerra, I would have 7-10 times the purchasing power now.
Additionally to the basic risks involved with bitcoin, mining tops it with a counter party risk, the hassle of looking after the miners and power expenses.
Personally, I will continue mining until the protocol functions as I like the idea of bitcoin a lot :)

First I heard about it on a UK tech forum (2011).
A member linked the white paper and told us about mining. I've started mining with a single GPU the same day.
Within 6 months I became obsessed with it and built my GPU mining farm.
After the first significant crash (crash from $6) some of my "friends" were laughing about me even saying I was a lunatic because I didn't abandon btc.
Since then I started my own bitcoin accepting business and I was able to exit the rat-race completely.
Even if our precious experiment crashes to the ground (to $0), I won't have to re-enter the life of the slave and I can only thank Satoshi for this :)
BTC FTW!

Which wallet have you downloaded?


That's normal. There's no need for giving details. 
That's your receiving address btw. If you give that to somebody then they can "transfer" BTC to your wallet.
Most wallets allow you to generate as many addresses as you want.


1.) Select an exchange (depends where's your bank)
2.) Register and verify your account (verification is needed because of AML/KYC regulations)
3.) Transfer money to the exchange
4.) Buy btc (create a bid order)
5.) Withdraw btc to one of your receiving addresses


Most exchanges operate with bank transfers. Below ~25Eur/GBP doesn't make sense to transfer money.
Sent 0.005 to that address.
@_date: 2014-02-17 09:52:04
How can you say that?
The volume on any exchange can be matched by trading 0.1 BTC enough times.

It requires a participant who promises that you will get the specified amount when you decide to part with your IOU.
When I get an IOU (eg: bitUSD) at a supposedly pegged value of $100 I expect that no matter what happens I'll get $100 in exchange for it.
This requires an actual 3rd party who will accept my IOU (bitUSD) and transfer $100 to my bank account.

Laptops/PCs are obsolete for bitcoin mining.
Altcoins are very specualtive and unstable, but Scrypt based coins can be mined with GPUs.

Thefts, dumps, speculators/whales exiting their positions and unforeseeable technical issues **will happen**.
If you think bitcoin is a get rich quick scheme (or that the exchange rate can only go up) then you are delusional.
I for one would love to see a good old fashioned "bitcoin panic" as it would scare away the opportunistic idiots.

from the wiki:




The value of **"1 BTC" represents 100,000,000 of these.** In other words, each is divisible by up to 10^8.
As the value of the unit of 1 BTC grows too large to be useful for day to day transactions, people can start dealing in smaller units, such as milli-bitcoins (mBTC) or micro-bitcoins (μBTC).

Typical first worlder perspective. I think you have a very limited perception of the world (including bitcoin).
I've been living in the leading EU countries and have worked with businesses transacting internationally. Banking always proved to be a source of headaches and inconvenience.
Even though I'm an EU citizen, getting a personal bank account was a pain in the ass for example. I had a (decent) job but 3 mainstream banks turned me down.
Anyone who actually uses their bank account for more than receiving their salary and spending domestically for essentials can confirm that banking is inefficient and a rip off.
There are countries which have currently cheap domestic banking - I give you that, however in the light of fractional reserve banking it's more of an insult than something to boast about.
On top of that, no matter how cheaply you can move limited amounts of money, you're constantly under scrutiny and the actual politics decide what you can spend "your" funds on or where you're allowed to transfer (and it doesn't even work 0/24 all days).

1: Privacy/remittance: Learn how to use it properly. 
Nobody can tell how many bitcoins/address you have if you utilize it properly
When you pay with bitcoin, you don't need to send your important details over the internet to 3rd parties, which would would allow scammers to steal from you later on. (debit/credit card numbers)
Your name and address won't make a scammer/id thief satisfied ;-)
2: Spending bitcoin equals to realizing your profits (or losses) in the form of other products and services. Based on my experience, if the value goes up I tend to spend more. I also find that using it is a lot more efficient and convenient compared to any other options, while it has the added bonus of no central authority to make it work.

Paying tax is completely different to exchanging currencies on an online exchange, so I don't understand your point.
BTW, the public quickly verified that mtgox has more bitcoins than they claim.
If we would pay taxes in bitcoin to verified addresses then praying on public money would be unviable.
Also, moving public funds could be constructed that it would need x of n keys to initiate the transfers.
If governments would spend money, it would require the addresses involved to be made public and verifiable.

Obviously, possible savings depends on your circumstances, activity and it's best if both transacting parties use bitcoin and it's not just used as an intermediary.
I'm a multinational who travels a lot and do business internationally. I'm exposed to 3 different currencies, several bank accounts (personal and business accounts too) and in most cases considerable banking expenses and inefficiencies.
Every time I can use btc instead of the traditional ways, it saves me money and time.
As an example, last time, my worst bank processed a transaction of 15000EUR (domestic!) for 460EUR. An other bank of mine charges 15EUR/month just to keep the account there + additional transaction fees and I could go on and on.

I'm not saying that traditional currencies cannot evolve or new/improved systems appear but bitcoin works very well and contrary to the current banking/payment processing world it has an amazing potential to improve.

I guess you mean coin validation.
1.) Bitcoin is global. Any negative modification to the protocol would cause outrage in the community and nobody would upgrade to the crippled version.
2.) Bitcoin is global. If you mandate businesses in some countries to only accept "clean coins" there would be a lot of countries/individuals/businesses who wouldn't care about this.
As much as I hate scammers/thieves, I think any modification which would negatively impact the fungibility of bitcoins would go against the essence of this system and would be rejected by the community.

Why do you think that litecoin is not overvalued when historically the popular alts always followed the movements of btc?
Your opinion is not rare though. I have seen bitcoiners who thought that it's seriously overvalued at $6, $25, $133 and so on. In my experience this attitude drives people to sell, which is beneficial for distribution.
The actual exchange rate doesn't matter if one has utility (They set the long term trends anyways).


Buying altcoins is not diversification if that's what you wanted to imply.


The problem is network effect, and the time advantage bitcoin has. I'm not against alts but I don't think that any of the current ones are interesting.
I own some of them, but I consider them too risky to spend actual BTC or fiat on them.

Mining bitcoin directly can be done with ASICs. 
If getting quick profits is your main goal then I wouldn't get into it.
Another route is to mine an altcoin with GPU rigs and exchange them to BTC.
Both scenarios are risky and require about 1-2K+ invested + continuous spending on electricity.
I would rather spend money on bitcoin and mine with a cheap USB miner if you want to support the network. Consider hosting a full node too.

I think it's evident that public figures have to step down from their positions if something goes wrong.
Charlie's case is completely different compared to Mark's.
Mark ran a disappointing service hurting his clients, furthermore the whole crypto scene indirectly. I'm very disappointed in how they acted throughout the downfall of mtgox. He proved his incompetence more times than I can count. All the hate is justified towards him.
Charlie on the other hand has been allegedly helped money laundering. It's completely normal that he stepped down from his position at the foundation. If he can clear his name I'm sure he will get his role back.
Even if the allegations are true Charlie didn't hurt anyone except his own career/reputation.

The value of "1 BTC" represents 100,000,000 of these. In other words, each bitcoin is divisible by up to 108.
As the value of the unit of 1 BTC grew too large to be useful for day to day transactions, people started dealing in smaller units, such as milli-bitcoins (mBTC) or micro-bitcoins (μBTC).

Be careful with investing in crypto stocks. It's highly risky and in my opinion it doesn't worth it. These are on the level of lowly penny stocks.

Mining is a self regulating process, if miners do not like the "profitability" then they will drop out. Their associated costs does not have anything to do with the costs of transactions.

Bailing out banks is not sustainable.


I'm talking about the fact that depositors are not rewarded fairly for providing funds to the banks which they are profiting from.
Anyway, I think comparing savings accounts and bitcoin is illogical. They are completely different.
 
Personally I would rather have control over my funds (which won't suffer inflation on the long term) than giving it to banks or any 3rd party.
What I really love to see is improvement in the bitcoin crowdfunding space. I think it would be more productive to directly channel funds for projects/events that I want rather than trusting a bank to invest it behind closed doors and often in questionable ways.

Fucking lunacy. Buying altcoins is not diversification. 
If bitcoin crashes all the altcoins crash. Check the charts it's been like this from the beginning.
The reason? Because all the altcoins face the same legal obstacles which is the number 1 "threat" to the crypto scene. Most altcoins (99.99999%) are merely PUMP AND DUMP schemes.
DO NOT SPEND MONEY ON ALTCOINS. mine them if you are interested or try to get some for free.


This is a bit better, but very risky. Do your fucking research. Don't listen to sockpuppets on the internet. DO ACTUAL FUCKING RESEARCH before you waste your coins.

Why do you compare bitcoin to a savings account?
It's apples and oranges.
And a huge BTW: If I had kept my money in saving accounts for the past years I would have only lost value.
If you look only at purchasing power bitcoin performed a lot better compared to any savings account or investments considering the past 5 years. Yes it's new, small, risky and different but it made much more sense than seeing your money turning to shit thanks to bankers/politicians.
I'm also not sure why can't you understand that the safety is only a lowly promise, it's only an illusion.

For generating bitcoin directly you would need ASIC miner(s) (specialized hardware).

Historically it was always better to buy btc than to mine.

Technically crypto currencies are the perfect tax havens, but I think there aren't many people that use it for that atm as it's too small.
Btc cannot be counterfeited, can be accessed anywhere, cannot be taken or connected to real ID's if the user is careful and there is full control of your funds.
Private tax havens are very risky because of the 3rd party involved which controls the funds and information.
Soon all the offshore/private banks will be scrutinized globally. :)

Actually some banks are pretty restricted and you have to attend in person to authorize (high value) transfers, deposit money, or just to change some details for online banking.
I'm more concerned that by having a bank account there are a lot of (unknown) employees who can access the account (not to mention the complete lack of control over your funds).
Many times even the cashiers make remarks of the account which is totally unacceptable in my opinion.
This flaw in itself warrants a departure from the current banking system.

Yes, it's the end of January and they failed to deliver anything other than a single promo product.
That means the january orders are likely to be shipped close to mid or end of february (optimistic guess).


I think they should offer a partial refund (15%-20%) or additional devices for compensation (+300-500Ghs).
That way I would return to them for my next ASIC purchase.
A full refund should be a basic right and not an offer. It's easy to give back from the newer customers money and btc they have mined with the devices.

I agree on the shitstorm part. It really depends how many people preserve the blockchain and accept bitcoin after the inevitable collapse.
Bitcoin is already a safe haven. The only way of efficiently move/store funds without the risk of a 3rd party (the value of this is not apparent for many people atm).
If things go really bad the only important values will be food, water, shelter and self sustainability and preservation for a while.
As the internet is the most efficient way to exchange information I think the restoration of it will be high priority after a reset.

Consider what companies (and a lot of individuals) have always done. They seek out the most efficient ways to optimize their tax and get around as much regulations as possible.
Governments are like parasites sucking the wealth and productivity out of societies. It always gets to the point where they grow too big and their regulations, rules and laws are so suffocating that it seriously cripples the competitiveness and productivity of the whole nation.

Wait for mass adoption and better distribution of the coins.
In my opinion, with a critical mass of users and adoption, bitcoin could be even more stable than old currencies (due to the transparency of the system)
These are still the early days so don't expect stable exchange rate for many years to come.
Check back in 5 years and see how things turned out if your risk tolerance is low (or exchange a small amount of fiat to bitcoin and check what it's worth and what can you buy with it later).
Personally, I'm using bitcoin for a few years now. There were many times when I experienced rapid declines and runups in purchasing power, but I'm not even bothered by the exchange rate now.
The first crash was very intense emotionally, as with all the historical crashes so far almost everybody said that it's game over for bitcoin. I understand that at least the first crash can be very frustrating for a newbie.
Before you buy any, please do your own research on bitcoin, it's a lot more than a speculative asset.

@_date: 2014-08-10 09:16:33
I think you have a lot of misconceptions.
Lately there were a lot of merchants and organizations accepting bitcoin. And all of the new ones convert to fiat.
If they announce their acceptance, **bitcoiners rush to spend** (I do it too) while (often unknowingly) pushing the price down.
Another factor is the newly mined coins. there are approximately 3600 new coins generated daily. Part of which is sold to cover expenses. Again more supply, hence downward pressure on the price.
There are other factors, DNM vendors cashing out, speculators/investors liquidating, etc.
I'm even surprised that the market can still hold itself this well, it means that there is demand for btc.
If you are worried by fluctuations you shouldn't be involved with bitcoin at this early stage or just limit your exposure.

1.) Bitcoin is backed by the network and the community.
2.) A fiat currency is backed by the promise of the government. Even if it would be backed by gold it would still depend on a promise (promise of exchanging paper to gold)
"1.)" is a lot more than a promise from a 3rd party it's a property of the system. Peter S. misses the whole point of crypto currencies.

If you send the btc in advance, you have the same recourse as if you paid by cash.

You completely misunderstood my comment and you are full of misconceptions.
I was talking about the gold standard in general.
If the dollar would be gold backed, it would be still an IOU. A promise that the government will honour the value of the paper with the amount of gold they have (which is not verifiable nor transparent).
While it's a flawed idea, It restricted the power of the state and that's why the gold standard was scrapped.
Bitcoin does not require the promise of a central authority nor it depends on the "mood" of a select few.

This I completely agree with.


The first reason is that I appreciate the technology. The second is that it enables to save money whenever I use it, and I find bitcoin to be the most convenient payment system.
I'm not a day trader, never interested me really.
I'm one of those weirdos who are not bothered by the exchange rate. I have experienced all the significant crashes (the current one doesn't even get close to those ;-), I just couldn't care which way it moves.
During my time with bitcoin I came to the conclusion that the best times are always after big crashes. It weeds out the idiots.
As I never had financial problems, if btc falls to 0 it wouldn't really affect me. Even if the price skyrockets I have no incentive to convert, I prefer to spend or donate it.

The model of paypal, banks or credit cards involves a lot of information stored about you at numerous 3rd parties and they also pose limits, charges and mandatory use of a government issued inflationary currency.
Once you transact in bitcoin all these limits and unneeded identity exposure are removed. Furthermore, you're not exposed to high fees and charges other than the currently optional $0.08/transfer fee* which goes to the "miners" who are verifying the transactions.
Having said that bitcoin has it's own risks and technical limitations, it's not a finished product, but an evolving project which is open source. 
Volatility is a widely criticized attribute, this can be scary for the ones who are not risk tolerant.
Considering that it's an experiment (maybe the biggest one ever created?) the progress so far is just amazing in my opinion.
People always compare it to gold, paypal, western union, banks, etc but it's a whole new concept.
'* If you don't include a fee, it can take considerably longer to verify a transaction.

The market will wildly fluctuate for many years to come. If you are nervous about this then you shouldn't have bought bitcoin.

Fun fact, bitcoin and systems built on top of it has a tiny fraction of consumption of the banking system.
ATMs alone consume a lot more electricity than the current bitcoin network.

The cost of miners do not really have much impact in my opinion. If professional companies won't find it profitable then enthusiasts will dominate again.

Your points are hurting my brain, george (If you don't mind me calling you "george").
There are people who hoard gold, money, junk whatever. there are hoarders of bitcoin, but the truth is that it doesn't matter. The market always sorts itself out in the end.
Your point of view is clearly based on the idiotic ramblings from the mainstream media and biased "economists".
Contrary to this idiotic belief, the more the value grows I have more and more incentive to realize my gains in the form of products, services, other kind of currencies or assets.
People who are on the same opinion as you, usually accept the above mentioned authorities and basically you would repeat anything what they say.
Illegal use? Volatility? deflation? No central authority? I never heard of these concerns, george :P


Everyone is free to use it as they see fit. Nobody is forced to do only one thing with their bitcoins. It's not a bank account where you are limited in uses. If you planned long term it was a winning proposition where I'm standing (so far).


I believe you never had too much money either...Spending bitcoin is the most convenient way of transacting.
I happily spend and donate. Since I'm involved I have alone donated more than $350K in todays worth. 
I did not regret it and I continue to spend and donate. :) It's all about perspectives, george.
Money is a tool not the ultimate goal. 


Volatility affects only the ones who have short time gains in mind...I think it is natural and inevitable at this early stage, it's part of bitcoin's evolution. I'm not bothered by it at all. (yes I have seen my purchasing power degrade and boom in many cycles now)
Go back under your rock, george and ponder with this beer's worth. One day you might be able to buy a spacestation so be careful when it comes to spending ;-)

Semi related:
I've introduced my father in law (high net worth) to bitcoin when the exchange rate was in the bubble topping at $266.
He decided to buy for $3000 and hodl as a start. At the current rate it's about $6000 gain in purchasing power.
He always ask for developments in the bitcoin space since he got them and this year he decided to convert 15% of his yearly profit from now on.

I'm completely familiar what the government provides and on what level. If you care to open your eyes then you could see that the whole thing is rotten. 


It really depends on the organization of the centrally planned entity. Non for profit is not exclusive to central planning.
The important thing is co-operation. You can fund police with anything which have value (gold, $, bitcoin, whatever) I hate when someone think that a society without an entity with ultimate power over the rest would mean anarchy and chaos.

Bitcoin is not a finished product. People have been working to make it better, more accessible and more useful.
A few years back it was worthless, without any utility and it wasn't accessible even for the average tech-savvy population (there was no point of it other than showcasing this concept).
There were no apps, exchanges, accepting places or projects built on top of it.
Today, everyone who has an android smartphone can use it easily and there are already niches which it serves well and mechanisms which it improves both in terms of efficiency and security.
You don't need to go to third world countries to find future potential though.
Banking and payment processing is very expensive, restricted and inefficient even in first world countries and transacting internationally is a complete disaster (fees and charges, and days required to clear).
There are a lot of other use cases  which I do not have the time to rave about now ;)

≠ bitcoin
I have raised my concerns about creating visible warnings about the risks involved and my posts have been downvote brigaded every time I tried.
On the other hand the rule of "Don't risk more than you can afford to lose" is always reminded for newbies or over enthusiastic people and there are many users who are pro-bitcoin but actively help and guide people without hiding the risks.
As with every other community it's not wise to label everyone based on extremes. 


Because it's a pro bitcoin sub, people come here to read about bitcoin related stuff and socialize with others who also like bitcoin (aka circlejerking).
If you are not bullish on bitcoin you have little reason to view the comments and posts here.
For example, I fully understand that bitcoin could lose it's value completely anytime, even today, but I just don't care.

I think that's an important feature for some. Personally, I don't have any reason at the moment to have any alts.
I believe interest in altcoins will die off gradually and only a few will survive long term.

Such nonsense.
They could accept btc directly (at least for their digital work) and save a lot if it would be widespread. This way they could cut out yet another middleman on top of banking (publishers).

Optimally, I would rather torrent everything and send btc to the artists afterwards if I liked their stuff.

Even if gox allowed to withdraw bitcoins, the real amount of btc there is a fraction of the volume reported to be transacted.

There's no consensus and you shouldn't really listen to anyone blindly. Always research things properly.
There are many ways to diversify and it really depends on your location, laws, knowledge/skills, interests and lifestyle.
For example, it might be a good idea to invest in properties in a given country (or even state) but a horrible idea elsewhere.
Consider how much time you'll have to manage your portfolio and what % of your current assets you actually want to use.
As the most basic advice I would consider allocating about 5% to physical gold/silver and getting weapons and ammo which is only good for hedging against a significant collapse.

2.) As time goes on it will be harder and harder to induce panic. It's already much better in my opinion (in the last 6 months ta least).

All I'm saying is that they don't have a working product and it doesn't warrant such high valuation. It's like overvalued IPOs of companies which often don't even generate revenues.
I cannot even count how many times I have seen similar hype. It doesn't matter how good the concept of ethereum is, it's still a premine.
In contrast check how bitcoin was valued when it was new or just a concept.

I believe nobody can represent bitcoin. It's a technology, a tool and everyone can decide what to use it for.

I haven't expressed any direct assumptions. It's purely logic.

Few more points, if you have no utility for bitcoin (eg: you are only speculating):
Do not take any actions based on emotions.
Do not spend more than you are prepared to lose.
Create plans, for both short and long term, periodically review these plans.
Understand that the price of bitcoin can fluctuate wildly (eg: imagine for a second that the purchasing power of your bitcoin declined to 1$/BTC or lower)
+1 bonus: do not trust any 3rd parties with your btc for long periods of time (eg: don't store your wealth on exchanges)

That's not a good idea at this stage.
From 2012 ASICs appeared making CPU/GPU and FPGA mining obsolete.
These purpose built chips are good only for sha256 mining, so they can be a lot more efficient compared to general use hardware.
A high end GPU rig would make a loss of about 10 cents - electricity / month for example.
Buying btc always made more sense.

Merchants cannot rely on it because adoption is still has a long way to go.

I was referring to the fiat (monetary) system going by your definition.
From another perspective:
My gov gets in serious debt which has been enabled by the very fiat (monetary) system (in other words the select few who control it). they expect that tax payers fund them and bail them (or their associates) out anytime the shit hits the fan.
It's like getting in debt in the name of your neighbour and getting away with it by violently forcing him to pay.
And here comes the "issue" of tax avoidance, a completely natural reaction to the monetary system (be it fiat, gold standard, the stress is on lack of transparency and power concentrated in human "hands").

3.) Evil bearwhalepigs, banks/WS conspired to attack the btc market and drive the prices down, trying to suffocate the whole movement in its infancy

Considering that the current system is rigged, manipulated and exploited for the benefit of a small layer of society it always amazes me when someone uses it as a standard.
It's not about inflation/deflation but transparency and accountability.
The gold standard have been left because it restricted TPTB.


These are the early steps, drawing conclusions are analogous to deem an infant a retard because he cannot grasp mathematical concepts. Bitcoin's volatility is due to the distribution of coins and not enough "closed" crypto economies.
If better distribution will be achieved then volatility will come down.
It has a slim chance though considering that this is the golden age of the sheeple. 
@_date: 2014-05-02 10:09:08


The price can be crashed when someone comes with a considerable amount of btc and "eats" up the bid orders.
With better coin distribution the markets won't be so fragile as there won't be entities with much higher BTC holdings compared to other participants.


That matters but without better coin distribution it would be still volatile.

The wallet is encrypted. I use a mobile blockchain wallet too.
In summary I'm using the following wallets:
- Android/blockchain - on the go spending (I don't store btc here for a long time)
- Linux/laptop - long term btc storage - bigger value purchases (only powered up for transfers, otherwise always offline)
- Win7/qt - short term btc storage, only for low amounts (eg depositing for tips, donations, etc)
- Paperwallets - long term storage for bitcoin savings
@_date: 2014-09-10 11:24:10
Most definitely, bitcoin still has a long way to go.
I think ease of use is already a reality though (depends on the implementation, but I find it a lot more convenient than any other options). 
In my opinion the following is lacking:
- easy way of obtaining it (be it exchanging or earning them)
- safety net (insurance for the plebs)
- more utility ("usefulness")
Considering the discriminatory and restricted nature of centralized finance btc have a significant market even in developed nations (more so that the problems caused by malicious monetary policies becoming more and more apparent)


As a person who frequently spends btc, I disagree. My last purchase for example had a 20eur crypto discount (390eur item), and there are frequent campaigns at several retailers. But I agree that the more discounts the better.

**[tails-news] Who are you helping when donating to Tails?**
Tails is being distributed free of charge because we strongly believe that [free software is more secure by design] ( But also because we think that **nobody should have to pay to be safe while using computers**. Unfortunately, Tails cannot stay alive without money as developing Tails and maintaining our infrastructure [has a cost](
We rely solely on donations from individuals and supporting organizations to keep Tails updated and getting always better. **That's why we need your help!**
If you find Tails useful, please consider [donating money]( or [contributing some of your time and skills]( to the project. Donations to Tails are tax-deducible both in the US and in Europe.
In October 2014, Tails was being used by more than 11 500 people [daily]( The profile of Tor and Tails users is very diverse. This diversity increases the anonymity provided by those tools for everyone by making it harder to target and to identify a specific type of user. From the various contacts that we have with organizations working on the ground, we know that Tails has been used by:
  **Journalists wanting to protect themselves or their sources.**
    * [Reporters Without Borders]( is an organization that promotes and defends freedom of information, freedom of the press, and has consultant status at the United Nations. RWB [advertises the use of Tails]( for journalists to fight censorship and protect their sources. RWB uses Tails in their training sessions world-wide.
    * [According to Laura Poitras, Glen Greenwald, and Barton Gellman]( Tails has been an essential tool to work on the Snowden documents and report on the NSA spying. In a recent [article for The Intercept]( Micah Lee gives many details on how Tails helped them starting to work together.
    * [Fahad Desmukh]( a freelance journalist based in Pakistan who is also working for [Bytes for All]( always has a Tails USB handy: "I can use it whenever I may need to and I especially make sure to keep it with me when travelling. Pakistan really isn't the safest place for journalists so thanks to the Tails team for an amazing tool."
    * [Jean-Marc Manach]( a journalist based in France and specialized in online privacy said that "war reporters have to buy helmets, bullet-proof vests and rent armored cars; journalists using the Internet for their investigations are much luckier: to be as secured as war reporters, they only have to download Tails, burn it on a CD, install it on a SD card, and learn the basics of information and communication security, and it's free!"
  **Human-right defenders organizing in repressive contexts.**
    * Tails has been used in combination with [Martus]( an information system used to report on human rights abuses, to allow [Tibetan communities in exile]( to protect themselves from targeted malware attacks.
  
**Democracy defenders facing dictatorships.**
    * The [National Democratic Institute]( a Washington-based democracy support organization that works in more than 70 countries around the world, has used Tails to [help human rights defenders to communicate securely]( For instance, NDI used Tails to created a [data collection system in Belarus]( to help opposition forces to collect, store and manage voter information.
**Citizens facing national emergencies.**
During the last years, we noticed that the use of Tor and Tails systematically peaks when countries face national emergencies. Even if Tails represents a small amount of the global Tor usage, it is advertised by the Tor Project as the safest platform to protect from strong adversaries.
    * In [Starting a revolution with technology]( Slim Amamou, Tunisian blogger and former Secretary of State for Sport and Youth, explains that Tor "was vital to get information and share it" during the Tunisian revolution of 2011, because social media pages sharing information about the protests were "systematically censored so you could not access them without censorship circumvention tools".
    * Between January 25, the day the Egyptian Revolution of 2011 began, and January 27 2011, the number of [Tor users in Egypt]( was multiplied at least by 4. On January 27, the Egyptian goverment decided to halt Internet access accross the country.
    * Between March 19 and March 31, the number of [Tor users in Turkey]( was multiplied by 3 as a direct response to the growing Internet censorship in the country: on 20 March 2014, access to Twitter was blocked in Turkey, and on 27 March 2014 access to YouTube was blocked.
**Domestic violence survivors escaping from their abusers.**
    * The Tor Project has been working with organizations fighting against domestic violence such as [NNEDV]( [Transition House]( and [Emerge]( to help survivors escape digital surveillance from their abuser and report on their situation. As [domestic abuse goes digital]( circumvention tools like Tor and Tails end up as one of the only options.

This is a false statement. You can try supporting it with data though.
1.) There were a lot of altcoins failing.
2.) Altcoins followed the price movements of bitcoin all the time.
3.) they are fragile and very risky.
4.) Most don't have any utility.
5.) While most don't even bring any improvement they all face the same obstacles as bitcoin
The only people who buy them are speculators thinking they missed the bitcoin boat while it haven't even left in reality.
I can see 1-2 altcoins sticking around but most of them will fail and more misinformed people will get ripped off as usual.

3. Use unique strong passwords/encryption to safeguard your private keys
4. If the amount warrants it, get a dedicated device for your savings (trezor or laptop)
5. Try a spending wallet like mycelium (using bitcoin is very easy and convenient imo)
6. Do not forget about multiple proper backups
7. Enjoy the ride

It really depends. On the leading exchanges it doesn't look that way. It seems newbies avoid these due to the hassle of AML/KYC.

It doesn't really matter if they buy bitcoin for it's utility or for long term holding. They represent the demand side. 
Examples: DNM users, hodlers, "libertarians" (people with political reasons) and people who transact internationally in btc, daytraders.
the market has diverse participants and merchants are only a part of the (obviously still small) ecosystem.


I wasn't saying that.
Understandably it's too early for most of the merchants to transact in bitcoin so I agree that merchants who convert to fiat increase supply.

That's tin foil hat territory.
I cannot speak for earlier times but from early 2011 to 2012 the community contained 99.99999999% "average" geeks.
As for the creators, be it a person (unlikely) or a group, I can completely understand that they wanted to be anonymous. There were many attempts at creating independent money and most of the times they were put in jail or worse.
Considering that it's open source and transparent, I think it's very unlikely that it's part of a conspiracy aiming to enslave the populations more.
If you are worried, I would be more afraid of the powers behind the US. They are clearly a malicious force, thirsty for full control over everything.

You cannot have fiat currencies on a decentralized market.

Banks and payment processors are highly selective of their clients for both domestic and business accounts. 
For example, as a foreign individual or entity it's a hassle to open accounts. Not to mention that they refuse to service many industries.

Are you sure about that?
The current hashrate is equal to about 40000 Terraminer IVs so there are still a lot of small time players (like me).
In the GPU days you would had to invest in mining rigs (about 2-3K EUR/rig) and pay about 1kw/rig electricity.
Now you have to buy ASICs + electricity. Nothing much has changed except that ASICs have minimal resale value and require a lot less maintenance.
In the GPU days mining was the same really. Because of the risks I don't think that  the "corporate" takeover of mining will happen any time soon.

Money service providers which are not compliant with regulations inevitably attract criminals.
If a company serves foreign citizens it will attract the scrutiny of the law enforcement of those foreign countries especially if an investigation leads to btc-e.
LE is also curious. I think some people already wonder if there are any "bad apples" to be found there.
That's why exchanges have to bother with AML/KYC otherwise they would be shut down, their location is irrelevant.

Volatility is completely natural considering the subject and its infancy.
@_date: 2014-12-24 23:41:44
It all comes down to your personal circumstances and risk tolerance.
By having paper gold, you trust the issuer of that paper, accepting the risk of them going bust.
By having USD you place your trust in the banking sector and/or the government.
Personally, I prefer to have physical gold, but I don't trade it, only sell some if it's appreciating. I understand that paper gold can be traded a lot more efficiently (although it could be made a lot better using the blockchain).
With btc I like that it can be traded for more and more things immediately while I can maintain complete control, and I don't have to trust a single entity.
As for the volatility concerns, I think it's not logical to expect stability for many years to come. Comparing it with mature and liquid markets is not very smart at this stage.
In 5 years the user base grew from a couple of people to about 2M+ today which is quite amazing (not many people expected this progress) but it's very small still.

Sadly, people won't do anything until it's too late based on the history of our species. The most important triggering factor is when the average people cannot provide food for their family.
I've been living in most parts of the developed world and I'm sad to acknowledge that governments do everything they can to make their populations depend on them. I'm sure the underlying philosophy is the notion of "don't bite the hand that feeds you".

BTS is the collateral for the contracts so it means that it won't be sustainable long term as it does not eliminate the volatility risks.


See, these statements are the ones provoking hostility. :D bitUSD is an IOU and it is affected by BTS volatility.


See the following points why is that:
- It doesn't have utility at this point besides speculation
- There are some annoying pumpers around
- It lacks documentation
- The resources that exists for it are crap
- Unproven dev team
- It's pretty much seem redundant

Firstly, if you expected for a complete btc victory within 15 years, then I think you were delusional.
For example, in europe the average rate of internet adoption is about 65% which is basically the theoretical limit of bitcoin adoption at this time.


Most web servers and system critical computers run linux based operating systems. While it's not used by the mainstream public (!.gov pushing corporate interest!), it's basically everywhere.
There's no need for a meltdown for bitcoin to find it's place and most likely it will co-exist with other solutions, just like mails (sending letters) are still a thing despite easy access to email.


Decentralization is a concept and the public doesn't even need to be exposed to underlying concepts.
I'm sure many use torrent but have no idea that it is p2p...


Higher demand helps bitcoin price, nothing else.
I think you are being impatient and got into bitcoin for all the wrong reasons.
Also, no offence, but I'm curious what have you done for helping adoption?
@_date: 2014-02-12 17:12:21
dealing 5K worth of anything on the streets is dangerous.
when dealing with in person transactions make sure you select a public place with internet access and security cameras if possible (eg.: cafes, bank branches (if you deposit the money in to your account), etc)  
Considering the amount bringing a friend or relative would have been a good idea too.

Periods of stagnation or declines were common so as sudden spikes in the past.

This is what people mean when they say that emotions should be put aside when it comes to investments or speculation. Having a plan is beneficial too.
The basic advice is: do not risk more than you can afford to lose. 
If you don't risk too much then you don't freak out or lose sleep over volatility.
At this point you have the following options:
- exit with a loss
- ignore short term swings and hodl (If you think that it will recover)
- buy more (if you think that it will recover)

You are approaching the problem from the wrong angle.
There are no solutions which provide 100% safety, not even banks or insurance mean 100% protection.
I have the following strategy when it comes to the security of my bitcoins:
- Long term savings: paper wallets, encrypted/backed up in 4 safe locations (it depends on your circumstances when it comes to finding good places to store these) + encrypted copy on pendrives (overall cost ~$200) &gt;50BTC (feel free to contact me for tips&amp;tricks)
- Dedicated linux box, /w encrypted backups, mostly offline for &gt; 10BTC (~$350) 
- Win7+QT, temp storage, spending, donating, &lt; 10BTC
- Spending on the go: blockchain.info wallet.
Now the physical threats
- home invasion - don't advertise your bitcoin holdings/wealth anywhere, keep weapons at home, CCTV and alarm system as deterrents.
- amnesia/death - create and encrypt a will for your next of kin (things like pgp are useful)
- being hacked - learn about basic computer security, use dedicated laptop(s) for your wallet, follow common sense and basic security practices.
The win7 client has not been hacked for 3 years now and counting. I use only legit software, and I don't click on everything "shiny", I run malwarebyte's antimalware and antivirus software too.

It depends. If the files are not that important then you could just ignore and reinstall your system.
Check if there are any bitcoin ATMs nearby, if not then check which exchange would be the best for your banking/country.
If you have a debit/credit card then check circle and coinbase too.
In the future make sure that you avoid malware (installing security updates, blocking js and ads by default, avoid dodgy software, run unknown software only in a sandbox, and most importantly, always have offline backups).

It depends on the bank/country. One of my banks for example require in person authorisation from about 6500EUR upwards (not western eu bank).
I also need to send in forms because of the tax office.
Not to mention other limitations (even with western banks) eg. you have to order money and it can take up to a few days for the bank to get it (from a few thousand GBP)
Overall I find banks very inconvenient and inefficient even if they have online banking.

Nobody knows. It can be 0$, $10000 or anything in between.
Supply and demand shapes the price.
I would consider the following:
- Bitcoin is in an accelerated inflationary stage. (downward pressure)
- Most companies convert all or most of their BTC sales to fiat (downward pressure)
- Porn, gambling, darknets, bitcoin savers (upward pressure)
- Growing public interest, network effect (upward pressure)
- Remittance business (neutral)

Nothing is without risks. Even if you pay someone to do it, you introduce yourself to the risk of that 3rd party disappearing or getting hacked.

I guess you haven't travelled much and didn't run or participate in running a business and its finances.


Sorry, but this is just short-sighted.
As a real world example, Wikileaks has been under a banking blockade and accepting bitcoin helped them out.
Governments are notorious for using their power over money and payment systems as tools of war.
Another example are artists who do pornographic or erotic content. They often struggle to find banking or payment processors, and there are many more affected scope of businesses.
Anyways, It's important that you have a choice when it comes to bitcoin or similar systems. If you're happy with your existing options, then feel free to stay with them, but please don't try to persuade me that the current form of banking and payment processing is good or why bitcoin sucks.

What a nonsense. That's completely different because they failed to deliver in time!
I have tipped and donated about $150K worth of BTC at current value and I couldn't care less that the value shoot up.
If one spends BTC it means that they **realize** their value at the actual exchange rate in the form of other things (be it products, fiat or services).
Your thinking is completely backwards and shows what difficulties bitcoin has to overcome on the mainstream level.
1.) Don't collect preorder money prematurely
2.) Get funding from private/public sources or loans
 Consider the following:
You bought APPL shares back when they were low. You exchanged them to $ when they gained to double value. Their value still grew afterwards you sold which would have meant an other significant gain in purchasing power, but again you sold.
Do you have any reason to complain?

Then you have to initiate the transfer where you need to give a lot of details (intl transfers), then confirm the payment with additional 2FA - If the online banking is even working (yes they have a lot of downtimes, if you use them daily then you'll see).
Then the transfer can take approx 2-24 hours or many days if it's an international transfer.
Online banking platforms vary (again I have 8 different ones) but you just cannot even compare it to the simplicity and convenience of sending crypto currencies.
1.) Login + 2FA
2.) Navigate in menus and Input details (sort codes are not copyable usually)
(2.a) Login again because the page timed out during giving the needed info for the transfer)
3.) Authorize
4.) Send
5.) Wait
1.) Input details
2.) Authorize
3.) Done
You can use cryptos anytime. Banking only operates on working days.
After sending the money with a bank, you cannot even confirm it's state until it's cleared.
If you transfer more than $10K the banks automatically flag your account and inform your tax office of the transaction.

Actually it's completely irrelevant at this stage. People who cannot comprehend easy concepts or schematics are not needed in the bitcoin ecosystem anyways (they wouldn't bring anything worthwhile at this point)


Funny story, "traders" said the same from the beginning of wider adoption (from early 2011), so please excuse me if I do not believe them :)
In my eyes traders does not represent any worthy knowledge. I consider them as lowly leeches.


I love to spend btc when on the go. We are still in the early stage, so any merchant adoption is beneficial.


Actually bitcoin is a separate system. the more people trust btc instead of banks the less influence they have on us.
As one of the Dread Pirate Roberts said (something along these lines), every transaction which is taking place outside of the system weakens TPTB. (which is completely true).
With systems built on top of bitcoin banks/wall street/stock markets can be rendered completely obsolete. An incorruptible alternative can be developed the first time in human history.

1. Are you aware that no fiat currency has "tangible" value? I for one value the technology behind btc. It's the only form of money which cannot be counterfeited. It's the only transparent payment system where you have 100% control over your funds and requires no middleman. It's the biggest always-on distributed network which proved itself for the 5th year now.
For me it proved to be the most convenient way to transact and to store wealth.
2. It's possible to mine, but you have to have good timing and proper hardware. It was always like this, even in the GPU days.
3. mtgox is an exchange, their closure caused panic but it has nothing to do with the future of this tech.
I wouldn't advise to buy bitcoin purely for speculation (we already have enough of those retards).

Firstly, make sure you understand what is bitcoin and how to secure them.
It's good to familiarize yourself with basic computer security too.
I wouldn't invest any of my BTC with companies, organizations, (or anonym strangers for that matter)  at the moment because there's no trustable platform yet to do this and there's a lot of uncertainty regarding to regulations.
 


Blockchain is the public record of all transactions.


Currently it's around 16GB. Not that much considering the size of a bluray disks (25-50GB) or the cheap 1000GB+ drives widely available.

In a simple mind the conclusion is probably just that, but:
- Using bitpay safeguards against volatility
- Integration is a lot easier
Bitcoin is an infant project without any authority pushing it. It's completely natural that the first vendors will convert their bitcoins.
Don't be so ignorant ;-)

1.) Firstly I would like to say sorry because as much as I disagree with you I was too rude or more like an asshole. It was not warranted.
Recommending to buy altcoins for diversification is just false and highly irresponsible (check the historical data). If bitcoin crashes all the notable alternatives crash. If there will be legal obstacles all systems will be equally affected. 
Buying crypto currencies in the hopes of profit cannot even be considered as an investment. It's pure gamble, it's called speculation.
2.) nevermind, it was a "not serious" call for a mod to remove rubbish
3.) Investing in infrastructure companies is fine, but **it should be stressed** that it's even more risky than buying btc itself. Don't forget how many retards are here. They see a comment and part with their coins without thinking. The community has responsibility to warn newcomers of dangers.
People always forget that these are still the early days of the crypto scene. There are no platforms which I could recommend for noobs to trade crypto stocks, because all of them are operating in a grey area if not outright illegal. There are no platforms to trade with confidence (yet).
I'm not sure how long have you been into cryptos but I've seen more scams and altcoins which were touted as exceptional fail than I can count. 
If you really want to advance this experiment then create businesses, ask existing businesses to take bitcoin, help and educate others and donate to organizations who accept crypto. 
Altcoins are merely clones with no utility whatsoever at this point. They are merely speculative vehicles. 
Bitcoin is not static, if a worthwhile improvement appears you can be sure that it will be implemented in bitcoin when it's tested properly. Bitcoin has utility, a proven dev team, history, a strong network, and an ever growing community. 
You can diversify to precious metals, properties, etc but for your sake, please forget the nonsense that by buying any altcoins you are defending against risks of bitcoin.
Again, sorry for my attitude towards you (and sorry for my english - it's not my native language).
 
 
@_date: 2014-04-24 10:23:53
That's why difficulty is adjusting. 
If the price won't go up but the hasrate will then miners will drop out, making mining profitable yet again for the ones who stay.
I'm not declaring war, but only a few altcoins have any utility (charity, spending)
I would also say that mining never was a definitely profitable endeavour. 
When the difficulty was low, the exchange rate was a lot lower. For most noobs it's not evident.

2. He always plays on the audience's fear of collapse

4. He only accepts fiat for selling gold. (He converts all btc to usd too)
Btw, Bitcoin has a lot of utility, being the first universally transparent and uncorruptible database in existence.

Mining was always uncertain considering the wild exchange rate fluctuations and hyperinflation of hashpower, but today the smaller players have no room outside of non-profit mining.
The business practices of the early mining companies (BFL, KNC, Cointerra, avalon, etc) have severely damaged the scene in my opinion.

Can you imagine how many gold holders have "special" connections like this? (I have my own suspicions on the accuracy of your statement/memory too)
There are **very few** places that pay fair price for your gold. The gold refiners are the best, but the one I know do it for 90% from 10 ounces+ for example. 
I'm not saying that there aren't any places which provide a good rate anywhere, but it's so rare, average people (the ones who are not familiar with the industry) won't have access to it. 


Collectibles are approximately as risky as bitcoin and it's on par with diamond when it comes to the hassle of selling.

While I completely agree with you I have a really hard time to get together a "local" bitcoin community. 
I don't see that the public will truly appreciate bitcoin or even realize that they desperately need it until it's way too late.
My main problems:
- Due to our fucked economy most people seek to get rich quickly from btc (in terms of fiat)
- There aren't many enthusiasts and the few which I know are lazy as fuck or poor
- Most people do not understand it and they do not care about it (unless government aids or their food supply stops)
And I live in a country which has exceptionally high taxes, high inflation, strict capital controls, high corruption, oligarchs, dying middle class....and I could go on.
Despite these things, people are numb, unmotivated, dumb and cannot see past their immediate needs/desires.

You have to pay taxes on any gain, the amount varies based on your circumstances. Check with the tax office, they are quite helpful usually. Contact them via email as the phone support is useless or get help from an accountant.

There won't be a successful terroristcoin, nor pedocoin and I don't think any alt will be successful which has anonymity as its main feature, due to the lack of network effect.
Also, there's no solution which is proven to be working atm.

Ordinary folks have no idea how software development works, so they usually do not comprehend that flaws are normal and inevitable.

Bitcoin is immune to money supply manipulations (what central banks do).
The value of bitcoin is set by the participants of the markets and it has nothing to with the protocol.
Fluctuations of the exchange rate are nothing extraordinary.
Panic sells happened many times, it's nothing to worry about (at this early stage it helps distribution of the coins), this is the reason everyone says that you shouldn't risk more than you can afford to lose and this is why spreading your bids over a couple of weeks/months is a good idea.

Having 50% of the hashrate leave at once seems highly unlikely, unless the power grid of china or the US goes down.
I still mine, although not for profit. Going by mining forums and historical price declines, newbies tend to turn off shortly after it turns unprofitable, but they seem to be a small fraction of the miners.

Actually I run a QT client on a windows 7 OS.
I don't keep any more than 2BTC there, and it has not been hacked since 2011 :D
The reasons:
- I follow common sense (eg I don't click on every single ad or link which I see)
- I don't run cracked software on it
- I keep the antivirus and malware scanner up to date
- I install updates for OS and applications
- I don't trust files from friends or strangers

For me, banking and payment processors are unbelievably inconvenient, so that is my main reason to be a bitcoiner.
There are many different layers, from people actually believing in it and using it, to speculators, and users doing illegal things.
Even if it would be only speculation and illegal activities, it would still have a lot of headroom to grow, considering that we just witnessing the demolition of offshore banking which is an amazingly big industry.
Also, what was the reason to buy btc at any prior point in its history? Either the resentment of the banking sector, utility or speculation. (or the mix of these).

That's called the 51% attack.


An attacker that controls more than 50% of the network's computing power can, for the time that he is in control, exclude and modify the ordering of transactions. 






















It's much more difficult to change historical blocks, and it becomes exponentially more difficult the further back you go. As above, changing historical blocks only allows you to exclude and change the ordering of transactions. It's impossible to change blocks created before the last checkpoint.
Since this attack doesn't permit all that much power over the network, it is expected that no one will attempt it. A profit-seeking person will always gain more by just following the rules, and even someone trying to destroy the system will probably find other attacks more attractive. However, if this attack is successfully executed, it will be difficult or impossible to "untangle" the mess created -- any changes the attacker makes might become permanent.

With centrally issued, mandatory inflationary currencies you don't have a choice but have to suffer losses.

Everything what's valuable is the target of criminals.
They could do that easily (forcing physically) with precious metals, cash, etc.
They could escort you to the nearest ATM to withdraw, or get your money transferred to an offshore account.
(Limits on accounts are a moot point, if you have and spend a lot of money, getting rid of limits is inevitable, and they can force you to remove limits/call the bank)
Bitcoin didn't promise to defend against coercion, but multisig (they would have to kidnap n of m people) makes it pretty difficult.

Cheaper, faster, safer, more convenient and not affected by borders.
Obviously, if you don't transact much outside of receiving your salary and spending it at mainstream businesses you might find it hard to find utility for it (outside of speculation).
If it would be widely adopted (eg. No conversion needed) then everyone could see its advantages easier.
Don't look at it as a product of a company, bitcoin is constantly evolving, and it is built by people like you and me.

Be careful with shitcoins. They tend to market themselves based on the latest trendy arguments against btc.
First it was the confirmation time then mining algorithm then inflation/schedule and recently, unfairly distributed, incomplete shitcoins are hyped on the grounds of smart contracts, usually asking you to buy in their "crowdsale" or "IPO".
Also, never invest more money than you can afford to lose in anything.

Bitcoin is a decentralized payment system. Cloud mining companies introduce centralization and the ones which didn't turn out to be scams were highly unprofitable due to significant growth of the total network hashrate and depressed exchange rate. (The more mining power is added the more difficult it is to mine.)
Mining was always the worst way to obtain btc. (Check historical difficulty changes and the track record of Asic vendors if you're interested)

If you keep it in bitcoin and you can code then I wouldn't use bitpay.
If you need fiat you'll have to use exchanges to convert your money. It's advised that you register and verify on multiple exchanges in case one of them goes offline.
If you want the easy way, then processors (like bitpay) allow you to specify what percent you want to convert to fiat and makes integration very easy.

People asking for btc acceptance is part of the network effect itself.
Everyone should ask their favourite businesses to accept btc (and hopefully spend there as well) and introduce bitcoin to friends/family.
This makes the network bigger and make btc more useful for everyone.
If enough people/businesses transact in btc then everyone can save on fees and transact basically instantly, without relying on companies/institutions.


Without people working hard (and without direct compensation) to make it useful we would have never achieved this much.

Then bitcoin is not for you at this stage and it's completely understandable.
There'll be insured bitcoin banks in the future.


Everything carries risks. The risks involved with banking might not be apparent for everyone but fiat currencies and banks can fail too.
Personally, I trust the protocol better than any fiat currencies and fractional reserve banking and cannot wait for the day when I can close all my bank accounts. I don't expect the mainstream crowd to have this attitude though. The majority of people require a safety net.


The risks of bitcoin are completely transparent, I think nobody should buy it expecting that it can only go to the moon without any chance of failure or crashes (the same way when buying stocks, or commodities).
Most importantly, bitcoin is an evolving project making its first baby steps. If you like the concept, there's no need to shovel in thousands of dollars and taking on too much risk if you don't want to.

If that happens hyperinflation will be inevitable in the US. Considering the monetary systems/economies of the others (the same ponzi is going on everywhere under different "flags"), all countries are equally fucked.

I'm not even sure what or whom you're arguing with.
99% of the newbies want/wanted to mine, because they perceived it to be printing (fiat) money from nothing, so bitpay's numbers are not surprising for that year.
I guess the volume of mining companies will go down for 2015 though.
Bitcoin is still small, if you expect constant/growing spending at all merchants (especially during a downtrend) then you're pretty much retarded.

Again, if enough users hit the network they are going to choke it. Imagine the stress test just with more transactions, and lasting weeks or months.
Confirmation times would grow and fees too. It's unacceptable during the bootstrapping phase.
A higher block limit won't prevent other ways to scale either.
Plus, the smaller bitcoin is the easier it is to change it. We cannot postpone this change without running into dire consequences.

Nothing. Bitcoin holders are not affected. This whole debate is highly overrated
There are 3 main scenarios:

2.) Less than 75% of the miners upgrade, no blocksize increase will take place (you're unaffected)
3.) 75% or more upgrades, fork takes place, minority will have to join to Bitcoin or live with their useless CrippleBTC. (you're unaffected, you can spend your btc on both sides)

This comment perfectly highlights your lack of understanding of markets (and bitcoin).
shitcoins which has been pumped, dumped and faded into nothing are perfect examples. If enough users abandon it then it can happen to bitcoin too. By going against the network, miners can easily cause the outflow of users.


By not moving their coins they make the supply on the markets less than if they would.


That stuff would directly harm users and adoption, and would certainly make most people dump their holdings. I can't believe that someone with higher education cannot comprehend that.

The price of a bitcoin will either go up, or miners leave, making it profitable again for the remaining miners. It's a self balancing system in this regard.

Everyone has a vote who runs a full node. Their vote is visible on the network.
As for your concerns about the way consensus is reached, I don't think that Hearn or Gavin is not open to other propositions.


Changing the blocksize limit (what basically everyone wants) requires a fork either way.

Changetip is a service which integrates with various social media to enable tipping.

It would be completely unnatural if the bitcoin market wasn't volatile in the early stages, consider its scarcity and distribution process.
You clearly have a lot of misconceptions, but you are right, if you can't tolerate volatility you should not get involved at this stage.


The point of bitcoin is that nobody controls it, thanks to its incentive system. It's an open source protocol, and its main innovation is the blockchain which is an incorruptible database in layman's terms.

Please consider to stop thinking in a binary way.
There are no investments which couldn't have caused losses during their history, not even apple stocks if you sold and bought in the wrong time.
In my opinion and experience, bitcoin is still a good investment despite the risks it involves and its infancy.
I've been owning and using it since 2011, it feels like seeing your child growing up. The bitcoin ecosystem of 2015 was incomprehensible even in 2012 and I don't think that it'll slow down due to its utility.

So derivative speculators are the norm?
If I want gold, I buy gold, not an IOU. The same goes for btc. if you don't own the private key, it's not bitcoin.
Pegging crypto to gold is a completely useless idea for the average pleb, building on the confusion surrounding valuation.

I would also add, that 99.9% of the time small scale mining was pretty much a zero sum game, spare the very short time periods when the exchange rate spiked due to increased demand, but it never was a reliable source of income.
Compared to mining it always made more sense to buy btc.

People are seriously clueless when it comes to this topic.
No one can expect laymen to run and maintain full nodes.
No one can expect laymen to run miners.
There has to be large scale farms, just like there are large scale gold mines and there has to be some kind of centralization (eg: headless wallets relying on other full nodes) to have any chance of public adoption.
It's not that bitcoin will have a central point of failure but complete and perfect decentralization is an irrational dream.

There are several ways to exchange BTC:
- Sell it on an exchange (you submit an ASK order with your desired price and if a matching bid appears then the exchange transfers your btc to the bidder and move the fiat to your exchange account - mind that withdrawing the fiat usually takes time and involves fees)
- Buy something with it. Cheapest and best option if you ask me.
- Exchange it p2p. You have to find a buyer through localbitcoins, mycelium trader or other platforms.
- Cash out in a 2 way BTM.
- Spending via gyft, foldapp, purse.io, bitcoin debit cards, etc (thanks @_date: 2015-07-23 19:33:57

The guy got it backwards which is not surprising at this stage, inflation is good only for the rich and very bad for the poor.
Think about it, the little money they earn for hard work will worth less and less as time goes by. It's basically theft from the poor, an additional tax.

It's not just on the technical level, however if you cannot grasp how it works then you probably cannot see why it's valuable. Most outsiders cannot even look past the exchange rate and its fluctuations.
Until it builds up "historic value" it's certainly a barrier of entry.


I suspected it to be a scam until I dug deeper and soon afterwards started using it. The bitcoin ceo certainly didn't scam me. :)
Using your (lack of) logic everything is a scam if it has value, except the things that your masters tell you that it's ok to buy.


So it's a scam, but used by people? Don't you see how contradictory that is?
Does it make you abandon fiat currencies, stocks, precious metals? Did your masters tell you that it's OK if USD is being used by criminals?
Are the users of your fiat currency filtered by your ideals of acceptable people?
Why I'm not surprised that you are a statist?
@_date: 2015-07-25 09:41:30
It's not sustainable and highly risky to manipulate bitcoin like that. 
The reason that gold can be manipulated through papergold easily is because there's no way to verify the promise of the issuer, and due to being physical, it's highly inconvenient and expensive to validate, store and transfer.
Bitcoin ponzis are not sustainable for long. The mtgox case is exceptional due to other aspects as well. It was the first exchange without competition for a period. They handled more than 80% of all the bitcoin trades.
When their withdraw issues started long before their collapse, the US government seized their US accounts.
If anything the mtgox collapse showed how resilient bitcoin is, despite its infancy.
Having said that, I would never buy an ETF which doesn't prove ownership of the corresponding coins.

Let me react to some of the points in that comment:


Every single market is like that (if it is not propped up artificially by central planners, but that is unsustainable and will end in a disaster). I think you have serious trouble understanding how valuation works.


Again, you are trying to look at it as a stock, but it's money and a lot more. A new form of asset.


The stock, forex and commodity markets do the same to retards.
Long term holders have been rewarded and the ecosystem is apparently growing.
Also, even the ones who bought at 1200 have a chance of going into green...


Why can't buttcoiners understand progress? The reasons it has a high barrier of entry when it comes to average people are underdeveloped applications, lack of insurance and lack of historic value.
Bitcoin is not a finished product, nobody said that it is.
Sorry but your perspective of bitcoin is still flawed due to your inability to comprehend basic concepts.

Do you realize that the world around you is not binary?
Every investment carries risks. Bitcoin is a high risk/reward phenomenon at this stage. Anyone who enters it knows that, spare the occasional retards. It's not like someone is holding a gun to your head to take on debt and invest in it.
Most long term holders have been rewarded amazingly for their risk tolerance.


I'm quite certain that they don't even know what bitcoin is. All the investment brokers I've spoken to advised against bitcoin too and showed complete lack of knowledge.They ultimately want your money, if you exchange some to bitcoin then they can't charge you fees, hence part of the hostility.
Some people need others to lead them, tell them whats good and what's not. They cannot make their own decisions so they follow their selected groups or public figures. They are the useful idiots. They enabled all sorts of wonderful things, from the rise of Nazis to the extremists of today. ;)

I think you fail to consider the possibilty of the hypthetical mining monopoly going down for some reason and the implications of centralized mining.
Where can the network fall back if there are no geographically distributed small miners?
More miners (hashrate) means higher difficulty for everyone so saying that small miners do not matter is inaccurate (individually they don't, collectively they are very important) and I guess you're the one who does not get mining.
Also I find your attitude quite pathetic, I'm not coming here for extended debates. Neither the community nor the platform are suitable for that.

4.) Easing the centralization of Bitcoin development
Would you propose that development should halt until a "perfect" mechanism is invented especially that the "Blockstream way" is a recent change?
Your whole reasoning is flawed. The ecosystem has been supporting a block size limit increase for many years now, the current situation developed because the apparent flaws of the Blockstream/Core dev decision making process.
If any entity could be systematically considered a dictator, then it's Blockstream/Core devs.

I got into bitcoin because I perceived it to be an independent, decentralized system. I want to use BTC on the bitcoin network and not a layer built on top of it by a profit oriented company.
Do not get me wrong though, I understand that scalability is still a grey area and the blocksize limit increase alone won't enable truly wide scale adoption, but having an overlord push the users off-chain prematurely is unacceptable.
A company having monopoly on bitcoin development goes against the very fundamentals of this system.
I do not like many of the current affairs, the apparent conflict of interest of blockstream is only one.


Without speculators liquidity on the markets would immediately disappear. Without them bitcoin would be pretty much useless.

Naive assumptions like that shouldn't be the fundamentals of anything. It's asking for a disaster (wink wink).
I've been involved with bitcoin for 4 years now and I'm very sad that we got where we are today.
At its core, bitcoin is a set of rules that participants of the network has to abide. 
Bitcoin itself is not Core, XT or any other implementations, but the collectively accepted rules of the network. It's not what Back or Hearn decides but what the network chooses. Individualism, heard mentality, popular-ism, corporate interests should have no place in this at all.
It's a decentralized system which means that taking out participants individually should not be a viable way to affect the network.
I've been following the events unfold from the beginning. After Mike Hearn's [post]( was upvoted to the front page and enjoyed apparent popularity, the censorship and bans began, followed by [Adam Back panicky fear monger post](
All hell broke lose, lies (XT is an altcoin, blacklisting, etc), FUD (read Back's and Szabo's tweets), fake satoshi email (which was referred to by Blockstream devs/sockpuppets including Adam Back himself), and here we are.
What you perceive to be "libertarian" refusal of authority is just common sense in my case. Bitcoin cannot be considered resilient if Blockstream maintains exclusive control over development.


Change is not inherently bad. A company forcing their ways on the users of an open and decentralized system is.

To expand a bit:


Define difficulty. For me the old solutions are all inconvenient, limited and flawed.


Chargebacks are not free and in the end, all customers pay for it collectively. Bitcoin requires personal responsibility and the associated risks are transparent and well known.
The ones who prefer to rely and trust 3rd parties won't really appreciate this system, and it's perfectly fine that way.
You're right that it's "wild-westy". It's not for the faint hearted. If you would feel safer with insurance, then (again) check back later if things have changed. Currently, Circle offers insurance for their accounts afaik, but you have to sacrifice your control over the funds for this.
Normally, people who are not disillusioned with the fiat system or centrally managed payment solutions do not appreciate the fundamentals of bitcoin.


Bitcoin is the first working alternative which does not require 3rd parties to function. Fiat currencies are not an option but mandated. Every single person has born into this framework. Before bitcoin, there was no viable solution to sidestep this "inherited system".

Mike hearn might be the most irrelevant aspect of this debate. Attacking him is a red herring.
The main point is that Bitcoin development shouldn't be under the control of a single group/company.
Mike or any other dev could propose anything, but the ecosystem have to decide the actual direction we are taking.

Shitcoin pump detected.
1.) You have to take the same additional steps with bitcoin and monero to use them anonymously.
2.) The public blockchain and transactions do not mean anything as long as you are free to manage and create wallets without giving out your ID.
3.) Monero pumpers usually forget the legal framework we are forced to live in.
4.) Even litecoin or dogecoin  (which are lowly clones) are more useful to clean coins due to better liquidity.

It's a logical fallacy as well, because keeping unrealistic limits will render bitcoin useless for a wider audience, hence contradicting their original goal of making it accessible and decentralized, it will end up being a plaything for a few neckbeards.

2.) The increase of this limit is desired by most or all of the community. (check polls, threads and discussions)
3.) The inaction of Core will certainly transform bitcoin as it basically lead to the users being pushed to other layers (read Blockstream's accessible plan)
4.) Nobody said that, Core devs want to stop Bitcoin's natural scaling to push people on additional layers. It's a fact, and Blockstream/Core is vocal about it.

2.) hot/warm wallet (Bitcoin Core, for receiving payments and distributing funds between other wallets)
3.) Offline wallet: (Bitcoin core on a dedicated laptop, running linux, for 50% of my savings - (Authentication on boot/bios, encrypting the HDD and wallet are good practices to keep in mind)
4.) Paperwallets (basically private keys printed with 50% of savings)

I don't think that it matters if the transactions are obstructed in the blockchain or not. (see scams, thefts, already existing illicit markets).
I guess that no sane criminal would spend their btc directly anyways so I can't see why these have any utility.
As the gateways can oversee, log and analyze transactions, Monero and the myriad of similar coins do not provide anything but yet another market to capitalize on for speculators.
It's one thing to get a neutral crypto currency accepted, but if the hype is based on "Designed for making money laundering and illicit activities easier" will be even harder to sell.
@_date: 2015-03-07 07:37:35
I can see the minimal introductory value of doge although it's pretty much redundant considering the existence of testnet.
kids might find it appealing so I would not categorize it as an outright scam.
Sadly most altcoin schemes are just get rich quick attempts of scammers or completely useless.
nubits and bitshares are the most questionable endevaours currently, both are being hyped a lot and their shills do not refrain from lying and twisting facts.

I think you meant deflation instead of volatility.

@_date: 2015-03-08 13:25:32
Personally I do not care about mainstream adoption much. I would be happy even if it stayed in its current niches (it transformed my life fundamentally for the better already).
The internet is the perfect analogy. It was inconvenient and hard to use (it's still is for many people) but look at its progress now...
The same way bitcoin was a lot harder to use and had a fraction of its current utility even 2 years ago.
If you can't find utility for it or you can't recognise the flaws of fiat yet, then check back later and re-evaluate.
Fun fact, when I came across btc you couldn't do anything with it besides spending it on alpaca socks and trading it on bitcoin forums.

Anyway, if it has any merit then it will be an useful tool for a very limited number of people (but easily crushed if normal people won't adopt it). Currently it offers nothing and it's a lot more risky and uncertain solution due to unreviewed code and shallow markets alone.

If any of the alts prove to be useful I'll use them happily but the altcoin market today is analogous to the penny stock market or even worse.

Bypassing banking blockades, free global markets, the possibility to send money over the internet without relying on a 3rd party, a public ledger which can store information in an uncorruptible way are already revolutionary things (only most people cannot comprehend/utilize it yet).

When you run a full node your IP is indexed by various sites like bitnodes, basically advertising that you might have btc which might worth to try stealing. (most home networks have shitty security)

Supermajority defined as: 800 of last 1000 blocks have block.nVersion == 4
Once supermajority attained, block.nVersion &lt; 4 blocks rejected.
After consensus reached: replace MAX_BLOCK_SIZE with a size calculated based on starting at 2^24 bytes (~16.7MB) as of 1 Jan 2015 (block 336,861) and doubling every 6*24*365*2 blocks -- about 40% year-on-year growth. Stopping after 10 doublings.
The perfect exponential function:
size = 2^24 * 2^((blocknumber-336,861)/(6*24*365*2))
... is approximated using 64-bit-integer math as follows:


(doublings, remainder) = divmod(blocknumber-336861, double_epoch)
if doublings &gt;= 10 : (doublings, remainder) = (10, 0)
interpolate = floor ((2^24 &lt;&lt; doublings) * remainder / double_epoch)
max_block_size = (2^24 &lt;&lt; doublings) + interpolate
This is a piecewise linear interpolation between doublings, with maximum allowed size increasing a little bit every block.

I'm following it from 2011 and I have a completely different view.
In my experience, the progress is amazing.
In the begining I was a subject of ridicule when I discussed btc among my friends... years passed (and a lot of things happened in btc world) and now some of them started using or valuing it.
I don't think that spending metrics or the behaviour of the early participants of the scene are significant aspects at this stage. Especially that based on my habits I don't spend nearly as much if I feel that it's undervalued.
For bitcoin to achieve stability big holders have to spend/sell/invest most of their holdings too.

You must be referring to xmr.to which is a centralized service which can log your activity rendering the anonimity features of monero moot (you have to give up your address, etc when you buy something anyways, and no, not many people will purchase fake IDs and set up drop addresses).
They execute javascript so they could unmask your real IP even if you're running TOR.
You would have to use basically the same procedures to make monero and bitcoin use anonymous so I don't see any point in using this altcoin or similar alternatives.
Furthermore we haven't even visited the legal implications of anonymity coins, and the numerous other concerning properties of these schemes.

Think of a bitcoin as an item locked in a safe.
The blockchain (you called it "btc cloud") represents the collection of safes uniquely numbered by (bitcoin) addresses and each safe has its corresponding unique key which is so complex they cannot be replicated again if lost. These unique keys are the private keys.
Wallet software are like key chains for managing and storing all your unique keys which allows you to unlock these hypothetical safes and move your btc to other safes.
The security of your bitcoin boils down to the safekeeping of your private keys
The most important things to keep in mind:
- avoid malware and viruses
- encrypt your wallet/keys with strong passwords
- do proper backups (several copies several mediums and locations)
- get a dedicated device if the value of your holdings warrant it


You can restore it in other HD wallets (wallet32, multibit HD, and maybe some others)

I think you have some misconceptions about anonymity, bitcoin and how the real world works.
Firstly, anonymity is not the goal of bitcoin. You have to be quite careful and plan ahead to remain anonymous (or to maximize the required efforts for uncovering your real ID). Most of the due diligence needed for this doesn't even involve bitcoin directly, but careful opsec.
As long as you can create private keys freely, able to purchase bitcoin without exposing your real ID, and also to spend/use your btc without the **majority** merchants blacklisting / whitelisting addresses (globally) we are safe from the "NSA taking over" btc.
There are certain shitcoin projects claiming to provide anonymity for it's users with untraceable transactions.
The main problem with this concept is the inevitable concentration of users who use it for nefarious activities.
- No legit businesses will associate themselves with "IRapeChildrenCoin" (or Monero or darkcoin, or the n+1. anoncoin) which will ultimately force it to be very limited and not useful for criminals.
- The gateways to "IRapeChildrenCoin" will be the focus of law enforcement (e.g: the anonymity part will be highly limited)

I would be highly interested in the statistics of BTCJam. I don't lend btc there. When I checked most people wanted loans to expand mining operations and everyone knows how that turned out to be.


I was referring more to the framework to be decentralized. Trusted entities could operate on a blockchain (like gateways of ripple), only they have to have the means (or contractors) to collect the collateral to make it work.
If bitcoin would be adopted on a wider scale, this could provide cheaper loans than the competition (mainly payday or cash loan companies).
Then again, I would be more interested to invest in legit companies or organizations using bitcoin.

Bitcoin is an infant, community built project with a small (but growing) userbase. 
If they expected meaningful traffic for such a niche service then they were very wrong from the beginning and shows that it was more of a PR move than anything else.
I don't expect them to do anything and I don't really care if they remove it as I don't plan to buy their products.
@_date: 2013-12-07 10:37:31
I expect that it won't be stable for at least 5-10 years.
It doesn't really concern me though.
If you spent more on bitcoins than you can afford to lose then it might be a concern. otherwise, just enjoy the rides :)

No, there are many misguided people out there like you, which is not very surprising because this aspect had bad press in the past.
In my opinion, having this p2p, decentralized money is well worth the energy consumed.
It makes the network more secure and with higher number of nodes it improves redundancy as well.
Also, GPU miners are on the way out, we'll have more and more efficient devices pushing down relative power consumption.
400Mhash / 250W
Not to mention the fact, that you cannot just measure the power consumption of the network. It's impossible to come up with an accurate number.

@_date: 2013-11-21 20:35:54
Don't get me wrong, I'm not against paying taxes (I would get in serious trouble If I wouldnt pay them).
But applying VAT on bitcoin itself is ridiculous.
@_date: 2013-10-06 20:19:44
Wish this could be stickied.
I would also add that do not buy any mining equipment if you expect ROI / profit.

The protocol needs time to mature, that's all. It's a growing economy with new players entering day by day.
Same with other technological advancements, there will be a lot more features built in, and I do hope they make it easier for the non techie crowd.

For me it's more like idiotic, but I can also see this getting popular in future.

When I was a noob I got a lot of support from bitcoiners which I highly appreciated. We NEED to help everyone, small things like this contribute to the adoption of bitcoin.

The problem is that their "scrutiny" and power provides the backdoor for their peers for exploiting markets.
I cannot think of any example where a central authority didn't cause corruption and ultimately crippling everyone involved.
With bitcoin there's a potential of creating a transparent system.

There are some steps which might help.
Make exclusions in the antivirus software for the bitcoin client if you didn't already do.
I would also check for file system errors and bad sectors.

Bitcoin is a community driven project. There's no authority which makes it mandatory or company to push it with a huge budget.
If you're not satisfied then come back in 3 years and check the progress.
All of the similar attempts have been destroyed so far, considering what bitcoin brings to the table I'm not surprised that it takes time. The average people is just plainly stupid. Most of them are lazy too. they don't even understand the concept of money, they are just using it.
I'm sure everyone wants to be rich, but watching the charts won't do any good for the protocol. ;)

inflation and banks storing your money has no connection. I'm not sure where you got that from.

Also banks are constantly targets of violent criminals. Buffers against attacks? I don't think so.

sorry but you are talking about completely different things.

First rule is to never risk more with any investment what could cripple you financially. That way you'll always have a leg to stand on (remember that NOTHING is 100% guaranteed).
Following this logic and looking at bitcoin's history, it's a worthy asset to add to a portfolio (I cannot recall anything comparable in terms of growth in purchasing power).
These families could easily go into bitcoin with a small part of their cash hoard and still be on the safe side without risking much.

Bitcoin is a very young software. Even now only a small portion of people know about it or own any.
I expect wild fluctuation for years to come, the influx of bitcoin accepting places is a very good sign though. The biggest concern now is regulation. Governments tend to kill similar projects as it threatens the business of the banking world / payment processors. 
Bitcoin is a decentralized system so fighting against it could be as useful as fighting torrent technology.
If you think long term volatility doesn't really affected anyone in a negative way, but none-the-less bitcoin can be unnerving when panic sells happen.
It's best to invest only what you can afford to lose.

It depends on your goals. 
if you want to profit, then it's not the best idea. 
Considering that it only consumes 30W on load, I think why not buy one if you can?
It strenghtens the bitcoin network, so it's a noble cause if you believe in bitcoin.
Also, because of the low power, you can save **some** of your mined BTC for selling it higher later. 
This has risk, eg. if there will be a flaw in the bitcoin protocol then it will worth 0.

Nowadays, I always use something along the following lines when describing mining:
The transactions in the bitcoin payment system are validated by a peer to peer network of nodes. This validation process is called mining and makes counterfeiting bitcoins impossible.
I also prefer to describe bitcoin as a payment system with a distributed accounting ledger called the blockchain.

Don't use their products and services. My last apple product was a an Iphone 3g and I hated it on all levels.

Erik wasn't negative at all. How much stake do you have in litecoin?
While I appreciate all the altcoins (I possess a few too), I wouldn't spend money on them.
@_date: 2013-04-30 08:09:34
There is quite a bit of depth to this question.
- For example it's important when did you get your coins, eg any value between 0.1$ - 266$ ;-)
- even better if you mined them.
- Future price of BTC
I think these guys - even the one with the highest bids - will be fine long term. Especially considering that running these is cheap in terms of electricity.

In my opinion, if they outlaw bitcoin they create the ultimate money of the underworld. Which will be used solely for naughty stuff.
If they accept it legally, and build systems helping fighting fraud and work with exchanges, then something good can come out of it.
As for silkroad, the state should make and distribute drugs and make cannabis legal. that way they would kill the whole black market.
@_date: 2013-11-05 09:05:19
It's hard to tell, because nobody knows the future exchange rates and difficulty levels.
Instead of a month, the only foreseeable period is approximately 11-14 days (time for 2016 blocks to be mined)
You can create calculations with pre-set adjustments (use a pessimistic figure to be on the safe side and avoid surprises):

Well said.  The flood of noobs always brings a lot of individuals who cannot take their eyes off the $%^^&amp; price tickers.
The actual exchange rate is completely irrelevant. People who are becoming emotionally involved panic sell often. Last time it took the anticipation of SR going down, a bust happened because a lot of people thought that it will affect bitcoin and they were fleeing from their positions. 
I've experienced all the big run ups and busts, I just don't care about the exchange rate, long term it volatility doesn't affected users negatively...the only thing that matters is the protocol and that it functions as it should.
Also, the legit economy is the most important. So far the progress is apparent, I really hope it will continue to grow.
There is a huge room to grow. There are 2 places to accept bitcoin in london for example, none of them in the city centre.
@_date: 2013-05-28 12:57:34

Using bitcoin is easy and convenient. Understanding stuff related to it might be hard for some.
1.) Understand how can you secure your bitcoin wealth and make backups (first small purchase is not a bad idea).
2.) Decide what percentage of your income you are comfortable to use for your bitcoin portfolio (do not go all in).
3.) Don't move it 100 times. it's completely useless. Bitcoin transactions are so easy one does not really have to practice, lol
4.) Profit (I kid I kid)

It's not surprising that he values the information technology aspect of bitcoin considering his profile.

The guy who bought that pizza was an early adopter and I'm sure he didn't go broke or have regrets.
When you spend your coins or exchange them to other currencies, you realize your profits (or losses) in the form of other things.
I know this concept can be weird if you are new to this, but growing exchange rate always make me use my BTC holdings more frequently.
It's an infant market at the beginning of wider adoption (and distribution), if you desire stability and certainty look elsewhere.

In my opinion having an independent p2p money is very important and well worth the energy consumed.
An average person's life involves so much more malicious activities it's not even comparable to the energy invested in bitcoin.
Btw, if one has the opportunity to modify their home a bit (nothing major), it's very easy to use the heat generated by miners to heat their home.

I created this post to try figure out how could it happen and for getting some advices regarding to this issue.
I really hope mtgox will be able to shed some light on this and help figuring out how did it happen.
The facts we know:
2FA was used, there were no notification of the withdraw via email and we couldn't find anything malicious so far on the PC he used (win7)

This is a problem. It's not clear at all for most people. China doesn't have a bitcoin foundation like entity does it?

Considering the price of storage and the pace storage space grows I'm not worried.
I'm not sure about the average users but I have 100/100mbit connection (domestic) which is already adequate to move large files over the internets.
Also, I heard that the protocol has the flexibility to deal with this issue on the long run, not to mention the already available light clients/webwallets. 
Do some research on Bits of Proof that's an other interesting development too.

Mtgox is ok if you are willing to wait a long time for your withdraws to clear.
Localbitcoins might be an alternative and I heard about  but you should check if it's legit, I have not tried it yet.
Recently there were news about a soon to be opened UK bitcoin exchange which hopefully will be good.

It depends on your plans.
Every user got some amazing growth so far in their purchasing power. The last peak of $266 is not looking that stupid now. But it doesn't mean that there won't be any dips later on.
If you couldn't care less for that $100 then you should go forward with it. Considering the amount I would buy in one go.

It happens with a lot of people who are not involved with bitcoins.
The bank have automatic systems watching accounts. If your activity triggers it, your accounts are immediately "frozen" and they report it to your tax authority / police / whatever.
If you contact your bank and the relevant authorities beforehand, then your accounts won't be bothered.
There's a reason why bitcoin came to existence :D

I agree but I don't think honest politicians will ever exists until we stuck in the current frame of living.
As soon as power comes into the picture, no matter if there are some honest voices, it nets corruption, so I believe the current system is pretty much flawed beyond repair.
Funny thing that you mention houses. I strongly believe that in an ideal world we wouldn't need to pay for properties.
Do you really believe that a person's life should be spent on working for a mortgage which he took to get a place to sleep and live? I find this idea so pathetic and pretty much a shame.
Then again, there's a bigger issue of over population which will ultimately end our race in my opinion.
Shift of thinking and change would be desperately needed, but it won't come from politicians who are accustomed to the current system.

Actually, it's easier, cheaper, faster and more convenient compared to my other options (which is bank transfer, visa/mastercard)
I got the coins earlier (cheaper) so I saved quite a bit of money as well.
Also, dealing with finances in a closed cricle is very efficient with bitcoin. We even have a BTC fund for the family, I hope it'll be able to cover some holidays :)
I think the main force is international payments and transfers for now. I order a lot from foreign companies and I just wish more of them would accept it.

Most old GPU miners and new entrants own the majority of the hashrate, most of them are average people like you and me.
Operating a mining business is a very risky endeavour. It carries even more risk than speculating on bitcoin.
I'm not worried about centralization. I plan on mining even as a passion, no matter what. (I mine with ASICs).
@_date: 2013-04-30 19:33:58
I meant that it depends on the community to keep bitcoin alive. Even if they continue bank account closures I'm sure that other exchanges in other countries will arise. Or a better means of exchange will be developed.
@_date: 2013-10-30 10:07:58
Considering that growing adoption is quite apparent and the huge headroom it still has, I think the future is quite bright.
It doesn't mean that there won't be fluctuations in price though.
@_date: 2013-12-08 15:48:29
That's why governments require exchanges to apply AML/KYC procedures worldwide.
The public blockchain makes bitcoin unfavourable for money laundering. Remember the remark on cash as the best way to launder money during the US senate hearing about bitcoin.
Also, by making logical laws they could render the impact of money laundering pretty much insignificant. (eg. war on drugs, war on anything, high taxes, etc).
I really hope contributions will replace taxes anyways...The current system makes the average people's life inconvenient but criminals can easily play the system.

I often donate and purchase things with bitcoin. When you buy something it's like realizing gains (or loss for that matter) at the actual exchange rate. 
I find paying with them a lot more convenient compared to other payment options.
Not to mention that every transaction strengthens the economy behind bitcoin.
At the end it's your call, do as you think it's best for your circumstances and don't let people tell what you should do.

A lot of my friends bought at 266 - the previous historical peak. The following dip was a lot quicker and it took a few months to recover.

@_date: 2013-11-19 22:36:27
It depends when you sell it. If you sell or spend it when the exchange rate is still less than what you paid for then you realize your loss.
Nobody can tell you what direction the market will take.
I can tell you a story though:
When the exchange rate spiked to $266 my father in law (61y old) got interested in BTC. He had some spare "play" money and he decided that he'll put $3000 in. I got him 15BTC  each.
A few days later the markets crashed, not like nowadays, but a lot more seriously....It wasn't a nice feeling..anyhow I told the fact and he decided to not give a sh1t about it to my surprise. All the forums and news told nothing else than bitcoin is dead and was only a bubble.
Fast forward to now. His BTC worth approx 3.5 times more than he had paid (even after the recent correction from the 1000's)
When I asked him whether he wants to sell it now, he told me to donate 5% of the (theoretical) profits in bitcoin and keep the rest. And if things go well he wants to purchase a sports car with BTC in the future :)
I hope he lives long enough to have the chance to do just that. 
Moral of the story, don't invest more than you can afford to lose. That way you won't give a f about the current exchange rate.

Or for that matter, if you are scammed in any other currency, there's only a slight chance that you can get your money back.
Most of the times the effort and hassle doesn't worth pursuing legal action against scammers.

I'm following BTC for a long time now. I have experienced the first significant crash from 30. 
In my experience there is a lot more to bitcoin than speculation.
However, It's good that neither of our opinions matter really ;)
I think that $150 is realistic for the current period and it should grow further with adoption. there's a lot of work to get there though, we need quality companies/services to adopt it.

Considering that bitcoin needs to get adopted to succeed, the price is very low at the moment.
Compare the market cap to other industries. Think how many of these markets would appreciat ethe system. If it takes off then the bitcoin price has to go way up to accommodate these markets.

"Bitcoins on a Mac, PC or online wallet are not safe."
This is a very misleading and false statement.
The desktop clients are just fine if you back up the wallet and encrypt it.
The other thing is common sense:
-Use a trusted antivirus software (there are some for free)
-Backup the wallet
-Avoid malware with browsing sensibly (don't click on everything shiny)
Most hack/virus is enabled by the stupidness of the very user, without this most problems would go away.

Read up on the structure of society when gold was accepted as money. It was a completely different world.
Later on they issued money and some of it was gold coins. It was controlled by a kingdom or other centralized entity
At that time and later on gold confiscations were quite frequent (and easy).
Not to mention that moving, storing gold is inconvenient and expensive.
Bitcoin = free transactions. Freedom, independence. yay :D

I'm sure it will, but catching the drops is not that easy. You have to prepare your funds on exchanges (which is risky and inconvenient in it self).Then place your bids and wait for them to fill. 
If you're yet another inexperienced speculator, I wouldn't advise to get involved.

Having started with bitcoin in 2011 and lived through all the major spikes. I think bitcoins price is completely irrelevant. 
The protocol and utility is important only.
Noobs seem to focus too much on price movements, but bitcoin is so much more.

Trying to describe it in a simple way:
Bitcoin is a decentralized virtual currency. It's better to think about it as a protocol (like torrent, VOIP, TCPIP) with a public ledger.
The ledger keeps track and records all the transactions made between users. The ledger is maintained, checked and validated by the peer to peer network of nodes (miners).
It's the first of this kind of "money" and enables you to transfer "wealth" in the form of bitcoins to anywhere in the world frictionless.
There's no need for a central authority to make this system work. Nobody has control over your "account" and without the consensus of the majority of participating nodes, nobody can change how it works. 
It's also open source, so anyone with the needed skills can review the code.

These are the early days of bitcoin. Today's trends won't mean anything in the long-term.
On a side note, Why would you buy the current generation of any product (computer parts and cars are a good example among other tech stuff) when the next gen will be much better?
I got involved with bitcoins from early 2011 and it's growing value didn't pose a problem for me and many others regarding spending the coins I mined, earned, bought...
Thanks to our consumption oriented world, people's perspective of value are distorted in my opinion. The only thing that deflation has to do with spending is that you won't neccesarily want to spend it on useless stuff.
There are already a lots of stuff which can be bought for bitcoin (VPN, domains, etc), but considering the infancy of the currency, it is highly likely that not everyone finds places to spend **at the moment.**

All the technology related stuff works like that. There is no reason to buy them, because you are going get a more advanced and better product if you wait.
I don't have illusions of bitcoin replacing fiat money completely, but I believe there is a huge space for bitcoin in the "current world" and bitcoin can co-exist very well with other currencies.
I can imagine state controlled crypto currencies. Also, never ending growth and consumption based society is not compatible with the real world. Humanity is without a leash at the moment and it'll have serious consequences sooner or later.

Personally I do not care about the actual price.
These are still the early days. Wider distribution of the currency just begun. 
It will be years until it stabilizes.
I've been using it for years. I had experienced the first major correction and the last one as well.
The price only matters if you are in for the short term.
I know experiencing a price dip can be frustrating to some, but it doesn't really matter if the fundamentals of the protocol are still flawless.

1.) You should educate yourself then. it's an open source project. A payment system.
2.) Nobody knows for sure, and I'm sure nobody really cares.
3.) Taking all the coins is not possible. Maybe they could try and destroy somehow. (nobody's have a crystal ball)
4.) Mining is not for everyone. It was foreseeable that 110 and 65nm technologies won't be competitive long because they are 10+ year old technologies. The market will mature and it's needs time.

Normal computers are not suitable for bitcoin mining.
They were used from 2009 to approximately 2010.

In 2012 the first ASIC processors have been developed and now these are used mainly.

Again you arrive at conclusions completely irrelevant.
At that time, there were a fraction of users and businesses compared to today, so it's obvious that the markets have been moved more easily. mtgox had an effect on price because it was the only exchange that looked to be trustable. There was no viable alternative for a long time.
Everyone knows that bitcoin is volatile as a currency. you need to examine a chart to see that, but the media prefers to report it all the time, so you only need to read articles from the popular sources. 
I think even the hardcore bitcoin supporters accept the possibility of a serious crash.

Accepting BTC is a bet on the future + expanding your user base at this point.

If mining is not profitable either the exchange rate will go up or people drop out making it yet again profitable.
Contrary to the common belief  mining wasn't really THAT much more profitable in the GPU days. The exchange rate affected it a lot and GPUs quickly flooded the network netting a quickly degrading profitability too.

Make sure you deal with trusted members on bitcointalk.org. If you have concerns then use an escrow like John K.
As for the financial barrier, I think one of the strategies to make bitcoin's adoption slower is to make trading bitcoins as hard as possible.
As for the separation from the masses, a few years ago I could buy and sell bitcoins on mtgox efficiently. Sending money took about 2 days, withdrawing took 5-6 days. Nowadays, sending money takes 8-10 days, and withdrawing 30+ days, all because of restrictions of the banking system.

Bitcoin is a tool. A piece of tech which is amazing in my opinion.
It's like nuclear power, you can use it for good and bad things.
Nobody will appear front of you to save your life, leave this expectation for delusional religious people. You are the only one who can change your life for the better.
As for bitcoin, do not think there's less potential in it compared to 3 years before. 
It's all about decisions and luck.

I think you got my comment a bit wrong. Online banking, visa/mastercard were just examples. I didn't mean that bitcoin should be used only for those features.
I don't see the lack of charge-back as a disadvantage. More like it's a feature.
Having said all that I didn't have any slow transactions since I'm using bitcoin, so I'm not sure why wouldn't it be good for POS. At least it's good for food/drink and some more even at the current state.

@_date: 2013-11-20 15:05:23
Everyone should fucking understand the following things:
1.) Bitcoin is a new project, the markets are far from established and mature, you cannot expect stability for a long time. It's not a get rich quick scheme. it has to evolve a lot.
2.) The exchange rate can and will go up and down (depends on the markets)
3.) Do not risk more than you can afford to lose. That way you can ignore the current exchange rate completely.
I had some friends buying some at the previous peak of 200-266. They theoretically "lost" more than half in a couple of hours. They didn't cash out that time and they couldn't be happier now.
I cannot really sympathise with panicky speculators.. All the required info is out there to make educated decisions.
 
@_date: 2013-11-13 20:59:03
It depends on your perspective. The growth is more important here. The actual exchange rate is decided on the markets and ultimately in people's heads ;-)
@_date: 2013-04-19 05:18:03
You have a point, though I would argue that "small" misconceptions and errors are forgiveable for a journalist.
@_date: 2013-11-04 05:18:17
Because that's maybe the fastest method to get BTC atm.
@_date: 2013-12-10 02:36:05
I've corrected my post a bit. It's possible to create this with 100% transparency, thanks to the properties of the blockchain.
Any vendor who's not willing to participate in sending a free sample to a laboratory for review makes the vendor less trustable so no anonymity is needed during the purchase.


I think it's in everyone's interest. Because of transparency it doesn't require trust. If enough people work on it I think it would be possible to get across the idea.

@_date: 2013-11-19 14:33:26
The difficulty of buying comes down to barriers of the banking system. When you're in "bitcoin", life is a lot easier. Using it is more convenient than anything out there.
Mind that it's still an infant/evolving project. It's far from ready to hit mainstream.
The recommended methods of securing a wallet comes under basic computer security at this point, which is useful for securing other digital assets too.
I'm following this tech since 2011 the improvements are amazing so far, but it still has a long way to go.
@_date: 2013-09-27 14:47:09
It doesn't affect the protocol itself. I have experienced all the price fluctuations and to be honest I wouldn't care if the value goes down even to 0.01 (I would buy like crazy).
Until the technical fundamentals are "intact" bitcoin won't go away.

Crypto currencies are basically good for every single industry I don't see anything wrong with prostitution.
The world should consider the Netherlands as an example. You cannot ban prostitution or drugs. It just makes matters worse.
If it's legal and "supported" it creates a safer environment.
If prostitution became legal there wouldn't be gangsters exploiting girls on the streets and diseases wouldn't be such a huge problem due to safeguards in place.

Arbitrage. It helps keeping the prices on various exchanges intact (eg we would need more people who do this).

I mined with 32GPUs back then (I started in 2011). I've experienced what happened first hand and it wasn't really calm as you try to picture it.
There were a lot fewer participants and eventhough the difficulty was not rising as quick as nowadays, but price fluctuations were a lot more frequent. Not to mention that a lot of GPUs appeared on the network too.
There were only a handful of places which accepted BTC that time and confidence in bitcoin was a lot lower.

I think this aspect is way overrated and examined from a false perspective.
Police won't find criminals based on purely transaction history. They use the suspects financial records to support their existing evidence against them and make their case stronger.
Most people have this completely backwards.
I'm fully against CP. I think it's a malfunction of the brain and it should be treated in mental institutions. The thing is, our civilization just started exploring the inner workings of the human brain and I wouldn't be surprised if paedophilia could be successfully treated in the coming years.
I'm not sure how many examples people need for understanding that as soon as you declare war against something it will create a thriving black market and underground.
CP providers are in for the money only, as soon as the numbers of peadophiles decline they would go bust.
I say we should examine and try to heal these people instead of casting them aside and making everyone's life worse as an outcome.
@_date: 2013-09-29 20:08:55
Don't get me wrong, I don't applaud bitcoin as some sort of messiah, however I strongly feel that it's the perfect concept - a step in the right direction to remove the power of the elite controlling our life through the monetary system.
Who controls money matters have the upper hand. Considering how human nature works, it is inevitable to have this power abused. Bitcoin removes this influence completely.

- the surge of accepting businesses
- the companies working on bitcoin related services/projects
- the trends of bitcoin forums in terms of new users
- that official channels starting to take it seriously
- that most people don't like that they have no real control over their money if it's in a bank or third party
I think the future is bright and it already proved that has a place in our world.
I'm not sure how many people remember, but even 2 years ago most news channels only laughed  about the concept of bitcoin and discarded it straightaway. And there weren't many places to spend them either.


Why would you need that if spending via a smartphone is a lot more convenient? The concept of credit/debit cards are a fail in my opinion.


You can buy premium cars with it already (in the US), I expect this usage to widen too.


Taxes are easily accountable even now. I hope to see a shift to contributions instead of taxes anyways

Mining provides the lowest possible income in the BTC world. Daytrading, and accepting BTC in your business have a lot bigger potential.
@_date: 2013-06-13 21:40:41
I would say you should sell them or buy things in BTC which you would buy for fiat.
There are a number of very good sites to spend BTC for example bitcoinstore.com, number of precious metal dealers, domain, VPN services.
If the price causes concern / stress for you then you shouldn't have bought them for speculation in the first place.
People who have use for BTC will gladly buy your coins ;-)

All in? you are an idiot :)

Not an accurate answer and shows that you have nothing to do with mining.
It's very hard to time your purchase right, eg: have an order in batch 1 with a company who won't run into delays and pay a fair price for the miner

It has utility, it works well, so it doesn't need "MLM people" pushing it.
@_date: 2013-10-04 15:55:22
1.) yes, the assumption is correct.
2.) it depends how you do that.
3.) Illegal sites use bitcoin "tumblers" to make them untraceable.
4.) The only way to purchase bitcoins completely anonymously and within legal frame is by using cash. (localbitcoins.com)
I think it's obvious that exchanges have to identify everyone as otherwise they couldn't operate.
Please correct me if any of my points are wrong and I'll remove/amend
@_date: 2013-10-07 06:45:05
I see the error in my previous comment. English is not my native language, so sorry about that.
What I meant, that a lot of noobs rush to order ASIC HW, in the hope of making profit, however it is not granted that you reach break even with any hardware, no matter how good the spec look like in the time of announcement.
If you look at BFL, they pushed the image of money making machines, which is quite misleading and far from the truth.
Anyways, my point is that mining equals to gambling.

It doesn't really matter. The only thing which would make bitcoin worth 0 is a fundamental flaw in the protocol. It won't die otherwise - no need to panic.
I understand your fear though, the btc market is scary for new "users"
I had similar fears when I started. I saw the price go $31 and crash to a few $ then followed the ride to $266 and down and up and down and....

You can buy:
- at exchanges (bitfloor, mtgox, etc. You need to consider which would be the best for you.)
- Locally (through ads, or localbitcoins.com. be careful of scammers)
You can mine them with GPUs, FPGAs or ASICs, but as we are waiting for the wider adoption of ASICs, this might not the best time to start.
There are folks who participate in mining just for the cause. It's your call to decide.
further info:
I also recommend the white paper: 
@_date: 2013-12-18 22:59:00
Correct, captical gains apply only to the £/$/whatever profits you made by selling BTC.
@_date: 2013-11-03 09:24:22
What risk? Accepting BTC is not like accepting credit cards or online checkout.
It can be done on minimal budget. Most stores nowadays have a computer/tablet anyways.
Intruduce them to how bitpay or coinbase works.
@_date: 2013-12-18 20:16:00
I think suddenly crashing from 266 to 50 was a lot more worrying than this "slow" down move from 1200 to 450.
Think in percentages...Nobody is freaked out only newbies who are surprised by the fact that bitcoin can go down as well (eg idiots)
Nothing new to see. Expect volatility to last for years.

You would need to invest a lot of money on ASIC hardware.
All of them are preorder and open for a long time now so a lot of buyers accumulated. By the time you would get your miner, there's high chance that it barely breaks-even, if it ever does.
You could ask who makes money on mining then?
1.) The asic hardware vendors
2.) The limited few who get their miners in the first shipped out batch
3.) the limited few who has connections at the asic vendors
4.) The ones who mine and take the risks of holding bitcoin for a long time (years) before spending or selling them at a much higher price.

I disagree, though you have a point about spending 50BTC and earning 45 for example.
Let's say I bought an Asicminer at 51BTC, this would have cost me 2295$ ( 
I could have exchanged the BTC into fiat, but as I don't need $ and I want to participate in mining that becomes a moot point.
If the miner makes only 14BTC the first month that means I get back 2100$. + any other amount it brings in afterwards. 
I know this won't apply for most of the people, but it certainly applies to some (including me).
Don't get me wrong, I'm aware of all the risks involved and also I'm one of those who are not really motivated by profits but passion :)

The issue of dark marketplaces wonderfully highlights some simple but important questions:
1.) Why are some drugs illegal while some are legal but have more negative effects?
2.) Why the governments won't make them legal and tax them while providing quality controlled substances and help and assist hard drug addicts?
3.) Why is money wasted on a war which cannot be won and completely illogical.

If everyone (or most people) would act and think as you, bitcoin would be utterly useless and it wouldn't worth much (not to mention 5-700USD).
If you profit, at least consider donating a tiny fraction of it.
When you need something, check if it's available for BTC.

I think you don't understand my point. "Deflation" is only bad if you apply it to the outdated, obsolete and malicious system we live in.
When I say "improvement and sustainability would need complete change in thinking", I was referring to the whole debt based society, the whole system, which requires mindless spending to push the sinking boat a bit forward.
I for one dislike the current way of living. Both the developed and developing worlds are pathetic in my opinion (for different reasons).
On the other hand I would prefer a world where money wouldn't be the ultimate goal, only a tool for exchanging. Knowledge and technological advancement would be 1st priority.
Look around you and consider the useless, mindless stuff around you and the pointless lives most of the people carry on living... :)

I disagree. If we put the speculative matters aside. It's not just that their purchasing power grows, but it enables me store wealth without any fees or charges.

Bitcoin is new. There are a lot of obstacles on the banking side (not to mention the need for wider adoption among merchants and improvements in the protocol)
If you are into other currencies, cfd's, etc. The same (or in cases even worse) AML procedures are in place. You could try contacting your bank, politicians and related authorities to make it better. ;)

During the last few years there were a lot of predictions which didn't come true. Nobody can really predict the market.
I think that story is not that significant and I don't find it believable that it has much effect on the market in itself.
However, the mainstream media stopped focusing on only the dark side of bitcoin (illegal things, money laundering). I come across more and more positive reporting.
Also, there are bigger names appreciating the idea + the influx of accepting places.
I think the combination of these are causing the "rally" or growth name it whatever you want.

@_date: 2013-11-13 18:00:48
It doesn't really matter in my opinion. 
devs, bitcoiners, "hoarders" (hate this word), speculators, miners, accepting businesses are all part of the fun. 
Don't forget that without utility bitcoin would have died a long time ago...As it's the very beginning of mainstream adoption, bitcoin will spread out more and more.
Also, I don't think most people do only one thing with it, eg only hoarding. As adoption grows you'll be able to use it more and more.
The next milestone would be the growing number of businesses paying part of salaries in bitcoins. It requires a lot more btc accepting places though.
@_date: 2013-05-27 17:21:50
Stability, if one particular price stays with us at this point also means slow adoption. so not much &lt;3 from me :)

Who would control it? On what basis should they control? Current economists have no clue. They don't even have reliable information which would create a realistic view of the economy.

Simple method for avoiding altcoin scams:
1.) Is it opensource? If No, then avoid
2.) Is it premined? If Yes, then avoid
3.) Does it have any improvement over bitcoin? If no, then avoid.
4.) Is it hyped a lot, but nowhere it is accepted as money? If yes, then avoid.
People who buy in to altcoins are only interested because of greed....they pretty much deserve to lose money, though I find it very shameful that bitcoin sites are promoting some of these altcoins.

This is the biggest risk of bitcoin. It happened in 2010.
The devs fixed it promptly though.


The blockchain stores information, calling it money sounds awkward in this context.
It is distributed all over the world so it would require a global catastrophe or an unrepairable flaw to "lose" the information stored in the blockchain or render it useless.
Reading your comment makes me wonder if you wasn't aware of this risk?
Do you already own bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-11-18 10:34:13
You are part of the community who set things in motion. If no one would spend or transact in BTC it would truly be a speculative bubble and nothing more.

Don't start mining now because it's a very bad time.
Asics are hitting the market, but you would be at the end of the queue, meaning that you have very high risk of not getting back your investment.
Wait until BFL catches up with their preorders and wait until the next gen ASIC hw hits the market.
If you place your order in the first batch then you won't have too much to lose.

Volatility is natural. These are still the early steps. The bitcoin user base is still very small and the market is not diverse enough yet. I wouldn't expect stability for years to come.

The actual exchange rate only puts off the ones who cannot really use their brain. At this point these people are best avoided.

Making profit from something does not mean it was an investment.
He was "lucky", think of it as winning the lottery. If he had sold at the wrong times he could have lost money easily (which many people did and still do).
The things which you should consider:
1.) Do not risk more than you can afford to lose
2.) The value of bitcoin is not stable. If it worths 1000 today, it doesn't mean it will worth that much tomorrow. It can as easily go down as up, hence 1.)
3.) Do not try to play the market without previous experience with high-risk assets.
@_date: 2013-11-14 14:07:03
You pay too much attention to similarities with gold and you completely disregard the function and effectiveness of the system. 
Bitcoin is a lot more than any other asset/system we have known before.
I think everyone understands that bitcoin will not crush but coexist with other currencies for a long time.
Labeling everyone as anarchists or criminals who prefer this revolutionary system is not very wise and makes you sound very short sighted.
Btw , I think most of the people agree that the current state of banking and governments are not beneficial for the average person.

There has to be a seller and buyer at the same time. If nobody would sell then buyers couldn't buy.
There's no need to panic, because of these price drops. I've been involved with bitcoins for a few years now and fluctuations are part of the trade. Nothing extraordinary.
If someone has utility for the currency then it doesn't really matter what the market dictates regarding to the current pricing.
Don't forget that adoption takes a lot of time. As it has been said many times bitcoin is not a get rich quick scheme.
If someone sells out during drops they can be considered weak hands with pure speculative thinking.
This is not a Bitcoin only behaviour - stocks, precious metals, currencies, etc - all have some "hype factor" or speculative forces which makes their price fluctuate too.
With bitcoin these are still the early days so it's more volatile.

Well, firstly, I'm luckily not affected by the past events, even-tough I have bitcoins. if it goes down to 40 then I still make profit. 
So as far as I'm concerned I don't need anyone to hold my hands.
BUT, exchanges have to stop "abusive" strategies. it's not good for anyone on the long term.
Existing markets have rules too, and bitcoin exchanges SHOULD put some in place. 
This doesn't mean that I want control. I want sensible rules stopping retards chasing the quick buck while stomping on a great idea and raping newbies.

People should look around themselves. Most of the stuff we consume are pointless or scam. We need a fundamental change in thinking, but I'm afraid that only severe catastrophes could achieve this change.
Planned obsolescence, unsustainable growth, financial slavery, declining standards of education are the root problems of the world.
Bitcoin is a tool in our hands to make things better though.

The profitability is based on:
1.) price of mining hardware
2.) Price of power
3.) Value of bitcoin (in fiat)
So there's no such thing as mining won't be "profitable".  Maybe it won't be that for some, but will be for others.
Also, the people who "drop out" will try to sell their devices. There will be an interesting market for second hand ASIC devices.
I'm looking out for some great deal on these :)

People in for a quick buck? They are definitely fucked.
Miners who do it as a hobby / passion? they are and will be alright.
Don't forget that the miners provide security, they make "counterfeiting" bitcoins impossible.
Back in the GPU days, it was similar, all the miners who didn't liquidate all their rewards immediately made significant profit.
Buying bitcoins was always a better option from an investing perspective.

I understand that it must be frustrating if you bought at the historical top, but there were similar occasions in the history of gold too (15% dip was the most recent).

This was already posted anyways. I find the reasoning laughable at best. 
The ones who call bitcoin purely speculation completely ignore the underlying tech, the state of  traditional finance (it sucks badly) and the convenience of using bitcoin. They also ignore the fact that bitcoin is in it's very early days. While I agree that speculation is significant, the innovation the protocol brings outshines this aspect by far.

When will people understand that the current price is meaningless.
If you don't invest more than you can afford to lose then the price doesn't matter.
If you have utility (which you don't seem to have) then the price is again irrelevant.
If you want to speculate long term, then 300$/BTC / 3B market cap seem quite cheap/small.
I would rather have lower priced BTC than these waves of idiots.

It's not just about the government itself but there are so many malicious methods used by the governments  it just make ones blood boil.
One example, in my country, governments decide and organize (public) spending. (eg. building of roads etc). Because the system is not transparent and highly manipulated, only companies with mafia/political ties get these jobs and profit from unrealistically high rates (the system works as everyone involved get's a piece of the pie and only the tax payers are fucked (sadly they have no means of changing this).
You cannot have easier money than this.

For example, the goal is to find valuable things (silver/gold), metal detecting involves retrieving a lot of junk and crap, but sometimes you hit a valuable thing, which is easily verifiable.


If you find a roman silver coin you can expect that nearby you will find other valuable roman stuff.
Maybe it's not a good analogy but none-the-less was a nice thought experiement :)
Edit: metal detecting maybe works as an analogy for mining though

I think you are too much fixated on the idea of not spending something which will probably gain value overtime.
In practice it just don't work like that.
1.) Bitcoin is a lot more convenient to use than any existing payment system
2.) When you need stuff, you buy them, no matter what properties your money have. (think of electronics or cars - you can always buy something better if you wait)
3.) You could spend your inflationary money on a deflationary asset rather than spending them - you don't do this because of 2.)
When mr mainstream media tells you that inflation is good, it might not be true. The subject of bitcoin shows maybe the best that we are being lied to a lot of times ;-)

It's a matter of supply and demand. nothing extraordinary. There were only good news lately, so that drives up the price as it creates public awareness.
When all time highs are breached, many bitcoiners decide to sell bigger amounts. (greed factor)
Newbies (and most bitcoiners) represent weak hands, when the price goes lower (due to bigger players liquidating) it usually generates panic among others which pushes the price even lower which generates even more panic. ;)
It really depends how many people decide to buy in at what level to reverse the dip.
It's an infant market, expect for the swings to happen for time to time. The currency is not spread out properly atm..

Every single community is like this. A significant percentage of the people are quite dumb - you cannot escape that no matter where you go. (btw, you should know this if you are as mature/experienced as you sometimes try to paint yourself)
The bitcoin community is good in a way that it doesn't hesitate to question things which are completely avoided by the average person (like the banking scam - most people do not even have thoughts about it).
Having said that I think it's not wise either to ultimately brand or reject someone based on current laws in this case. 
Clearly, the pressure was too much and he couldn't think clear and made the stupid mistake of the claimed assassination orders - which is the sole reason I cannot respect him anymore. But I also don't think that there's anyone who didn't make any mistakes during their lives.

The actual value of bitcoin does not affect it's utility.
It's still the only thing which cannot be counterfeited. It's still the only system which enables frictionless transfers, no matter where is the destination physically.
I'm sure that part of the price is speculation, but I cannot see any other asset/currency/stock out there which has value and free from speculators.
As a relatively long time bitcoiner, I think growing adoption is quite apparent.

It doesn't change the fact, that you can exit anytime via a refund.
Having said that I didn't have any high expectations when I ordered from them in 09/2012. They looked the most sympathetic compared to avalon at the time. I'm not fussed about the delays and I hope they will deliver.
Attacking BFL through this or any other forum, instead of asking a refund is childish in my opinion.

backup your wallet.dat file, if you didn't already.

4.) delete all the dat files in

Considering that the "powers" crushed every attempt so far I cannot see that any single company would have the b to start something like this. And it wouldn't really work in my opinion from the mining perspective either.
Accepting bitcoin on the other hand carries a lot less risk and the system have a huge amount of miners behind it already.

In my opinion volatility is not a bad thing. It's an infant market and it's nothing extraordinary, furthermore it should be expected.
The market will always decide the price, but you cannot expect it to be stable when so many new people enter the market.
As the market matures and adoption grows, I believe the frequency and fluctuations will be a lot less significant.
It's still small and it would be considered that until it reaches a lot bigger market cap. Think about it, even 10 times bigger would be still small and that's $2000/btc

I fully agree. Bitcoin is far from a finished product and a lot of people don't know that. The protocol has to be refined and places to spend need to continue to gain in numbers.
A bitcoin dev (Gavin if I recall correctly) mentioned the issue with the fees too, they are working on a method to dynamically set the fee. I look forward to the outcome of it.

Again, how do you know? Actual BFL miners believe that the exchange rate will go higher compensating for their misfortune with delays.

The price of insurance is built in the bank's charges. As bitcoin is an infant project, it's too early to expect insurance.

Concentrate on the blockchain when you first explain bitcoin to them and later talk about the other aspects. (open and transparent "ledger" which is a record of all the transactions.. is a good start)
Understanding the basics of "old" money helps too.
I think it's better to guide them to sources of information other than half baked explanations.
whitepaper, wiki etc..
@_date: 2013-04-11 19:05:39
I suggest you to stop panicking.
If BTC can stand up after this then it deserves to be alive.
I have started with mining BTC in 2011... I got profits and some spare BTC too. The crashed happened...everyone panicked the same way.
I bought in  and cashed out this investment at 200 with some profit.
I'm not bothered at all. Exchanges and services need to evolve and people have to be educated.
The fundamentals haven't changed, and I still appreciate BTC as a technology.
@_date: 2013-12-03 12:24:40
shopify could be an alternative too.
@_date: 2013-11-07 15:57:30
Not really. The difficulty adjusts at every 2016 blocks.
If you consider the number of newly minted coins vs volume of public exchanges I think it's apparent that even if the time of block generation speeds up significantly It's not within reach of affecting the market.
Currently we have supply of around 50 400BTC/10-11 days. The current 24h average volume on BTC China is 69 500BTC

It really depends how you perceive money.
Why would you by a computer today when your money can purchase "more" in 6 months time? 
Why would you buy a new car, when it's value drops 20-30% as soon as you leave the dealership? Also, you can buy a much better car if you wait 1-2 years.
I like to spend BTC if it makes sense (competitive price, international order etc, avoiding bank transfers, payment processors, etc)
The value can go up and down as well, same with other currencies really. (my national currency fluctuates 20% time to time.)
I think the fear of spending is way overrated. 
I would welcome more and more quality shops / services to accept it as I would have a greater selection for shopping.
@_date: 2013-06-06 20:23:16
Don't get me wrong, I don't care about the tracking of any of my purchases/trasnfers as all of them are legit.
However, I think it is easy to create multiple wallets for 1 person and distribute some coins without directly sending BTC from 1 address to an other. I don't really want to give a how-to but I think it's relative easy to do.

No, it doesn't mean that, it just means that your miner submitted 6 shares (6 "pieces of work").
Your reward is being calculated on the number of your submitted shares relative to all the shares submitted in a round.
The bitcoin reward goes to the pool account, and you'll be able to transfer it to your wallet from there.

WTF are you talking about? The markets set the price, it is what it is :)
Do you really think that you have such an insight of the whole bitcoin economy that you know what should be the "fair" price? 
Considering the scarcity of bitcoins if it will be adopted widely 1 BTC have to be well over $10K+.
Think in market cap instead of /btc price.


What do you sell? I see only trolling when I look at your comments not seeking for help or support.
The merchants and businesses can choose what % they want to convert. 
You could consider me as one of the crazy bitcoin people, but even I keep only a fraction of profits in btc. 
I already pay my domains, hosting and other internet services with btc and I hope to pay for packaging, (IT) equipment, etc in the future, if that happens I'll have to convert less and less amount to fiat and I'll be able to save a lot on transaction fees and other banking expenses.
It is a strange concept for the average person, so don't expect that it will take over the world in a fortnight.

I think that in the early stages bitcoin accepting businesses could pay only a part of salaries in bitcoin.
It could function as bonus for example.
This could help distribution of coins.
@_date: 2013-11-16 12:06:58
First and foremost it's an open source payment system. How the hell could it be a scam? Get your facts right...
@_date: 2013-11-07 15:47:09
All the people who are involved including the miners, and every party who accepts it as payment set it's value.
In analogy it's something like a consensus of "in bitcoin we trust" :)
Mining gold with the least efficient methods costs around 800$/ounce. I guess the most efficient is a lot cheaper. If I recall correctly, actual usage in the various industries gives around 20-30% of the overall market of gold the other stuff is only speculative.
The value of bitcoin can be difficult to grasp for some people though. A lot of people still think that there's anything backing their national currencies, which makes the transition to bitcoin a lot harder.
It has 2 properties which could help, bitcoins are finite and impossible to counterfeit at this point, which basically makes it the first type of currency which can boast these properties.
@_date: 2013-11-21 10:50:22
It's futile to try and time the market. If you like the idea then buy or earn BTC if not then leave it. Quite easy to decide. 
the correction happened when it went down from 1000. even 900 could be a nice entry point if things go well in the future.

I don't want to defend them, because I don't care. However this makes reddit look like a bunch of idiotic angry kids. It is as boring as anti-AMD / anti -Nvidia flame wars.
How much money did they not pay you? What did they lie?

BFL made mistakes on all fronts I agree with that. I have some BFL miners operating but I just cannot recommend this company to anyone. I would even advise to avoid them.
The delays were a huge let down, but I don't even want to hear about them anymore. It is very boring and pointless to have these BFL threads around.
Any noob who's looking to enter the mining scene are properly warned everywhere already in my opinion.
@_date: 2013-10-23 14:31:51
Long term users so far have not been affected by volatility at all.
Only speculators whine when they think its "expensive". considering the potential, even 500 is cheap, in my opinion.
I hope a lot of other people realize that the exchange rate doesnt really matter.

You cannot just maintain a reliable stream of coins with any given ASIC. As the network gets bigger, your share of the pie gets smaller and smaller.
for example:
When I started to mine with ASICs, my average reward / day was 2.4BTC. forward time a little bit (3 months) and the devices get 0.6BTC/day.
In bitcoin mining world, you are only able to see 2 weeks forward ;-)

Basically nothing new have been heard. the banking world hates bitcoin and they want to see it die.
@_date: 2013-10-05 21:59:59
My advice:
Do not buy it at this point. You will be at the end of the queue.
Timing and miner efficiency are the 2 most important factors when ordering a miner.
If you cannot secure your order within a couple of days of the pre-order announcement, you will hardly break even.

1.) You cannot just fix something if it grants power to a select few. They have an incentive to stop changes :)
2.) It's for the good of the people right?
3.) I prefer decentralized solutions...with bitcoin there's a choice. What you use is mandatory.
4.) It provides transparency - using public addresses. Don't forget that it's not just a speculative vehicle but a protocol - basically programmable money.
5.) The current model is centralized - eg you have 3rd party risk all the time (you don't have control over your funds)
6.) Nobody wants it now, because it's against the interest of the "elite" to keep things as it is
7.) I'm not investing. I use it as a currency, mine it, donate it and I also speculate on the price (not really bothered much about the last though, so I don't day-trade or panic/cheer on price moves)
8.) I wish I had as many bitcoins as many time I heard this nonsense. Time will tell if it has a future or not.

Your impatience makes me think that you're one "the younger ones" and pretty short sighted at that.
I do hoard some bitcoin and also spend and donate regularly. It doesn't really matter what you do with it as long as the system functions.
Bitcoin is revolutionary, you can think of it as a payment system, currency, asset, commodity and I think it's part of why it's so brilliant. 
There weren't anything like it before and (evidently) adoption takes time. If you don't like this aspect then I wonder why you are here?
BTW, the growth is unprecedented. I think it's hard to find anything even slightly comparable in this field. I have to think that you should reconsider the matter in a couple of years if you don't have use for it at the moment.

Considering the fact that no single entity backs bitcoin but all the people who use it, the current state of the market is quite normal and expected.
Instead of the usual models the bitcoin economy is being built from the bottom of the "financial food chain". (small businesses and individuals pave the way)
Nobody can see the future, but considering the growth in accepting places and the growing number of people who are willing to work or provide something for btc, the next step is quite inevitable, that is "closed" bitcoin business chains (a few years down the line if you ask me).
I run a few businesses myself and I can tell you that the traditional system is inefficient and cumbersome when it comes to paying expenses, salaries, bonuses, taxes, etc. It's inconvenient and expensive compared to bitcoin when it comes to money matters.
My current strategy is to keep 5% of the profits in btc and exchange the rest for covering all the expenses.
When companies appear who provide services for bitcoin I will adjust the % converted.
In 2014-2015 I hope to be able to pay for the following business related expenses with btc:
- accounting
- packaging materials
- employee bonuses
Every single expense which is paid by bitcoin would save money for the business,and ultimately making the price lower for the end user. 


Depends what you mean by development work. If you mean the work of the bitcoin devs, it's quite clear that the technical properties and features of the protocol have an effect on the usage of bitcoin. There's still a massive headroom to progress in this field.
Everyone who's developing bitcoin related services/businesses are part of the fun too and will have an effect on the bitcoin economy.


Those bitcoins end up in the hands of people who are willing to buy them, so it helps distribution. Volatility is a natural part of the "first steps".


Nobody can answer this as It would require travelling forward in time. Personally, I look forward to the future developments and opportunities. :)

I really hope you're wrong. As for myself I'm not that young either.
The main property of bitcoin is the true freedom to transact without any limitation and friction. This didn't exist before and I think the importance of it is evident.
This will obviously attract illicit use, but I believe it's not that significant, even more that the problem is not with these sites rather than the obsolete law and working of the government.
Out of around 10 of my friends who actively use bitcoin, only 1 had used the road before. and even he didn't return as nothing arrived so dismissed it as a scam.
Anyways, bitcoin is far more than the criminal underground, if you don't see it I think you have some short sightedness issues. :)
As for your concerns on the future, I too understand them, even my country is slowly turning into a police state :S
The sad thing is, that the public have the tendency to just watch until it requires blood spilled to make it better.

Not everyone wants to daytrade with these securities.
Not to mention that you pretty much gain 1$/share after 1 week of waiting (if the exchange rate stays the same).
The volume is so small that selling a worthwhile amount could easily push the exchange rate  much below 1BTC in my opinion.

Don't forget that you got your HW a bit cheaper if you ordered in the first few months, and you get returns even in BTC if you have ordered before 09/2012.

Because of a very bad experience with paypal (they sat on my money for 6 months), I applaud all the new companies accepting bitcoin. There's really no need for third parties and I hope they will be rooted out sooner or later :)
I do all my donating activity with bitcoins only, which is very convenient (not to mention the fact that I don't have to give out details, so it saves me from any spam from them)
I do order quite a lot of things from abroad and bitcoin really shines in the aspect of international transfers.

Many people are speculating, but it doesn't stop other people to spend/invest them.
I'm using bitcoin for 3 years now, and I see amazing improvement in the places for spending. For a half year now, I always check if something can be purchased in bitcoins first (For me it's much better and more convenient compared to cards, bank accounts, payment processors)
there is a massive flow of companies and positive feedback too, so I'm very optimistic about the future.
Also, bitpay offers to forward part/full payments in bitcoin, so conversion is not mandatory.
I couldn't care less about speculators and their impact, long term "bitcoiners" are not affected by them.

Having the blockchain is a lot more favourable idea in my opinion compared to having your funds controlled by an authority.
There are different methods for different kind of users. Currently a bitcoin user can achieve any degree of anonymity if he/she chooses to do so.

You don't have to convince anyone. It's more than enough if they know that you use BTC and it works.

@_date: 2013-12-18 16:56:32
I'm not libertarian but I consider the current monetary system as a scam and I think it's financial slavery.
Bitcoin removes the need for a central bank. Their alleged reason for interference with bitcoin is money laundering and criminal activity. 
Anyone who have common sense can understand that centralized organizations are always prone to corruption (look at history), making these illicit activities viable and unavoidable.
Bitcoin is transparent on all levels. It's fundamentals cannot be changed without scrutiny and agreement of the participants. 
The transactions are publicly verifiable and irreversible, having a potential to make a lot of industries more efficient and with a good escrow system making marketplaces completely safe.
Can you imagine a government transacting in bitcoin? All the tax they use would be verifiable, making the malicious activities impossible on the most important level.
I don't care about the exchange rate (it's an infant market). I only care about the technology and the potential it has.
I see the powers pulling the strings of everyone's lives unnecessary, malicious and a burden on humanity and future progress.

I'm not sure about other ones obviously but since there are a surge in bitcoin accepting shops I always prefer to buy something instead of exchanging BTC to fiat.
There are more and more shops around and I think more and more people will do the same.
It just takes time.
It is impossible to have complete and accurate insight into all the markets in my opinion.
Belittling "normal" trade is quite wrong. Anyone who bought something with BTC can attest that it's a lot better than paying with any other payment option.
It's faster, easier and overall a lot better experience.

My take on the issue considering Bitcoins brief history so far:
Wikileaks bank blockade: Only BTC donations worked.
All the banks and payment processors betrayed us (the peasants)
It's the living proof that a free market can work very well. The illegality of the products exchanged is irrelevant, only the model is important.

If you want to get into mining then keep an eye on manufacturers (all of them need to prove their competence) and wait for the next die-shrink. (probably between 2014-2016), and time your purchase right (eg: as soon as they open pre-orders)
It's a high risk field and it's not for the faint hearted.
@_date: 2013-10-06 21:01:22
Maybe my point was not clear enough then. I meant it's not wise to keep all your saving in cash (or in a single asset).
I wasn't critical of people having savings, but people who think stockpiling cash is a good idea.
@_date: 2013-12-30 10:22:35
At this point there's no insurance offered for bitcoin, so you would lose it if the blockchain becomes useless.
It's a risk which is again stressed everywhere.
This is the reason for the frequently mentioned advice "Don't risk more than you can afford to lose", (which is true for all financial decisions.) :)

It depends what you are looking for. I think you should learn a bit more.
Do you have utility for it? - in this case the price doesn't matter
Are you in for quick profits? - bitcoin is not a get rich quick scheme, never was
Are you in for day trading? - again the price doesn't matter, only price movements
Do you want to save some in BTC - If you understand and appreciate the tech, bitcoin is seriously undervalued at 200 if you consider the potential.

- Saving the banking/payment processor charges and fees
- Control over my bitcoin wealth

- I would welcome more accepting businesses and services
- The banking world's hostile attitude

I'm not sure how others think but I will keep mining no matter what anyone says.
While it will be a big set back for bitcoin for the short term they cannot really do anything about the existence and operation of the protocol.
Not to mention that there are many nations which don't really want to follow the "american way". I think there would be a place or places where BTC could thrive.
Also, banning it would raise yet again a lot of concerns about the freedom we really have.

It's time to re-evaluate the methods of our leadership.
I'm against harmful drugs, but anyone who objectively consider what weed really is comes to the conclusion that alcohol should be banned / restricted instead of cannabis.
Legalizing it would net lower crime rates and I think most of the people would turn away from drugs which are proven harmful (cocain, crystal meth etc).
Also, the fact that it helps a lot of terminally ill people without the harm done by artificial substances used by medicine.
Not to mention the generated income and work from cannabis cultivation. It would be a win-win situation for everyone. (except the forces behind the black trade...without governmental or high level support non of the illegal operations would succeed for long)
There are places where they take advantage of this like holland and some US states and I really hope the common sense will win and other nations follow this direction.
So silkroad can be assessed as a bad thing, but I think that assessment is very short-sighted.
War on drugs will never achieve anything positive, it only worsens the situation.

I think the stance of the government is the force keeping these companies from adoption.
Bitcoin is still an infant project and these companies do well no mater what.
Bitcoin would be an additional payment option not exclusive, so they don't have a lot of risk accepting it other than the price of implementation.
I would welcome new companies who accept bitcoin and grow with the community rather than these old ones who have a record of ripping off people.
@_date: 2013-11-06 17:56:12
Entering mining now is not without risks (never was). If you expect for definite profits or break even then it can very easily disappoint you.
Not to mention how hard it is to get an ASIC miner for a good price, in time.
Some people do well but you can easily end up with losses too.
I would give her a bitcoin instead and make her see how it's value turns out, how more and more legitimate businesses accept it, how convenient and easy it is to transfer them and the ways they can be used for good things (donations).

As always and since the very start of bitcoin, you will find responses along the following lines:
Bitcoiner: It's just the start, Bitcoin will go a long way and will be much higher than this, considering the scarcity and usefulness and the amazing possibilities it can enable.
Skeptic: It will crash and never recover, it's just a bubble.
Anti-bitcoin: It's a laughable concept or might be the purest form of satan itself.

Ah, the bloody "late comers". As a long time miner I think it's funny that these people paint a picture of GPU/CPU mining that it was the best thing on Earth. It never was that good. I know because I lived through it from start to finish.
- It carried more risk - younger project, more uncertainties. 
- The unusual profitability was caused by the sudden price growth, and it lasted max 1-1.5 months
People should get their facts together before drowning in envy.
Having said that I agree with the last sentence. Buying bitcoin is a lot better idea for the average folk and probably much more profitable than mining. It can generate losses too. What a surprise...

Your whole concept is wrong. Backup is easy. There's even a built in function in the bitcoin-qt wallet.
My experience is that people are lazy. they don't bother to google a bit for solutions. they want things to happen without making any effort. IT became a very important part in our lives, so everyone should  widen their knowledge a bit.

Using bitpay they won't be affected by volatility and it makes paying taxes easy after btc sales. Also bitpay has a quite nice model compared to other payment processors.
I think it also worth to keep a **small** fraction of the profits in btc, it's well worth the risks.
It's a powerful marketing tool as the community supports open minded businesses.
There's really nothing to lose by accepting it.

I agree on some of your points however I think a few of your statements are very inaccurate.


Bitcoin is a payment system, hence your statement is false. Some people associated with bitcoin can be shady, but bitcoin is an open source project, it's the opposite of shady as fuck.


Anyone who base their purchases on someone else's opinion or hype is a fool. 
Buying at the @ 266$ still have the potential of returns if someone is in for speculation (patience is needed in this case though).
Nobody pointed a gun to the buyer's head when making those buys.  Similar movements in price happens and happened in regulated markets quite often. With bitcoin, the free trade commands the price, nothing extraordinary happened.
As for myself, I will never liquidate all of my bitcoin wealth, not even if it goes to 1000s.
@_date: 2013-11-12 19:43:20
If you can/could profit and diversify into some other assets too, the bitcoin market becomes less dramatic and you will not care about the actual price and swings at all. ;-)
I cannot imagine anyone who would abandon BTC completely right after  they made a lot of money on it.
At least this is what logic dictates in my opinion.
Not everyone is a greedy daytrader...

In my short 3 years with BTC I got disappointed in most of the main sources of news which I've been reading.
One can have an opinion about BTC, but none of them brought any valid argument up against it so far. They just hate it because they receive money for hating it publicly.
Funnily the main online newspaper in my country, won't stop bashing BTC while advertising VISA/mastercard through their articles.
These FUDsters represent the most pathetic piece of the propaganda machine.
Basically they are mere prostitutes :)
@_date: 2013-04-19 14:03:42
I say that the price of bitcoin does not really matter.
It's utility which is important. There are many countries which does not even have proper banking facilities, or effective/cheap payment systems. (and some of these are even **in the EU!**).
There are so many aspects of bitcoin which is very useful for humanity, it's a shame that too many people focus on specualtion.
Also, considering the fast adoption rate the internet provides, it's not surprising that the economy outgrows it's utility at the moment. Businesses need to take notice. We need quality services (like namecheap which is already accepting BTC).
@_date: 2013-09-17 16:04:26
Again, the commenters are just pathetic. Such ignorance...
@_date: 2013-04-30 10:41:25
It's amazing how different 2 opinions can be on this subject.
Let's say you bought BTC at 10$, then sold at 30$. Next day the price went from 30$ to 100$. Do you consider the difference as a loss?

Most of the bitcoin startups bet on the future progress of bitcoin (especially if they are exclusively built on bitcoin like bitmit). 
Most of them operate without the financial capabilities of a huge company like ebay.
You cannot introduce something and crush the competition immediately, it needs time to progress.

I think majority of the bitcoiners understand that bitcoin will coexist with other payment systems, that's inevitable. Whether it'll continue to grow or not will depend on the community behind it.
All of your concerns have been answered reasonably a thousand times, I'll go as far as to suspect that you copied the whole post probably from bitcointalk, hence the mention of Silkroad despite it's not so recent closure.

Once I woke up to the fact that my bitcoin holdings were eclipsing all my investments...I was  surprised, or more like shocked...I was thinking of cashing out but then I realized that I don't need £. ;-)

When I started with bitcoin, you couldn't do much with them. There were only exchanges and that was all.
Then we had wordpress and namecheap, and today I see more more businesses accepting. You can now even buy a freaking space trip :D

If the current market cap would be the peak on the long term, I would be disappointed personally. (i've been using it since 2011).
The whole thing depends on the community behind bitcoin though. If enough bright people gather around this tech and work hard then the potential is quite amazing even from this point.
My opinion is that it just started to gain momentum, but you will see opinions contrary to this.
The best thing would be to familiarize yourself with the concept and decide it for yourself.

A lot of virtual currencies have existed so far. (linden $, ,wow gold (these were intended as game currencies), liberty reserve, egold and many more)

Also, it depends on the country but transfers within the same bank can take up to 2 hours, not to mention international transfers (days) if you compare it to current banking.

Some of the "best" responses:






what to do with their money.




I'm not sure what people expect from a completely new market. Time will sort out the volatility, it's nothing extraordinary or anything to worry about.
Long term users have not been affected by it in a negative way so far. In my experience it doesn't affect utility either, especially that merchants tie their prices to fiat understandably. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 00:19:02
Sell as many as you like. It's nothing wrong with it. If no one would sell then this economy couldn't function and spread.
If you want to spend that money I would look if it can be bought for BTC. It's the same as cashing out without having the inconvenience of banking.

It's not the best time to get in mining.
1. The ASIC vendors started to ship devices recently, which will make the difficulty to rise significantly (check hasrate graphs)
2. There is a huge back log of orders at every company
If you would order a 50Ghs device now, then you would be looking at 3-4months of wait until you receive your unit.
By the time it would arrive it will hardly break even in 1-2 years.
As an early miner, I would advise to wait until the next generation of ASIC hw, and try to place your order in the first batch.
Otherwise, it's a very risky investment.
(for the record, I had started with CPUs, then switched to a GPU mining farm and now I mine with ASICs)

those are not important in this context, as you normally chose the mining hardware considering the properties of the network. 
It's more of an ASIC buyer's perspective. I was just referring to the fact that mining will always be profitable for somebody unless the exchange rate is 0.

Very good thoughts. 
Lurking these forums, I noticed that many people check on bitcoin and they didn't understand that it is very far from maturity. They want a "finished product", what is accepted everywhere.
Living in a country which implemented online banking only around 2 years ago, not to mention the lacking VISA/Mastercard acceptance, I can fully appreciate that game changing technologies like this take time to improve and expand.
It is just the beginning. That's why I emphasize that we need to keep an eye and fight false / misleading journalism.
There will be more and more services and products available.
Another analogy: Think what gmail offered years ago, it was just a simple webmail. And now, it's grown to a feature rich set of tools for efficiently manage / administer your life and connect with others.

Considering the number of idiots, it's not that surprising. :)
I'm more concerned about the organized agenda some news sources have.
A lot of newspapers and online sources of information are in the hands a small group of companies and wealthy individuals (guess what they also own and exploit? :D). Ultimately these biased sources of information can affect the perception of the  general public and slow down the adoption of bitcoin.
The nazi propaganda machine is an amateur attempt compared to what we have today.
This is a lot more concerning than some random trolls. 
@_date: 2013-12-22 14:15:42
everyone is adding "value" (not in terms of actual exchange rate) if they are part of the system.
As bitcoin is an infant project the need for defending against volatility warrants the existence of service providers like bitpay.
I think there's nothing wrong with this at this early stage, also merchants can specify what % they want to convert to fiat. It's all about distribution of the bitcoins and technical improvements for the next 5-10 years in my opinion.
If you are in for a quick buck then this may be a concern for you, but it immediately means that you cannot grasp that bitcoin is far from a finished product...Time is needed for BTC to spread and evolve.

If you would order now, It will take approx 6 months until you receive your product. At the moment BFL has a 1 year back order.
By the time you would receive it, difficulty will be so high it won't generate much. If you ask me it's not worthwhile at this point, however there will be a lot of opportunities in the future (next gen ASIC hw).

Not sarcastic at all. I think that the understanding of basic english and some internet search know-how is essential to easily obtain bitcoins.
As Bitcoin is not ready for the adoption of the average public (eg.: technically completely illiterate), I think it's optimal that we have some bottlenecks at the moment.
I can think of a few mistakes which noobs could run into easily. (infected host, sharing private key without realizing, etc).
Funny thing is that usually these people are similarly lost in the online banking world or electronic payments stuff, so bitcoin doesn't have that much of a handicap.

I find this angle quite pathetic as the illegal circles find their way in the banking system even though they have AML policies and basically total control over all aspects of the "old" monetary system.

Firstly, please take some time to understand what does bitcoin mean - and decide what are you after (independence from centralized finance or just speculating in the hope of £/$/whatever returns) that should clear the question of why.
As nobody can predict what direction the market will take (neither short or long term) you cannot base your decision on comments of strangers. - this should clear the "when" question. 
1.) You can buy them from a person (if you have connections) or use localbitocins or forums
(make sure you deal with someone reputable)
2.) You can buy them on exchanges like bitstamp, mtgox, etc
( it depends what country you live in, what bank account(s) you have) 
3.) You can earn bitcoins for your skills or stuff you want to sell.

The bitcoin protocol is open source. There are a lot of eyes checking it, and you can be sure a lot of them are trying to get it "hacked"


These thefts are happened due to lack of security on the companies part. It has nothing to do with the protocol itself. In analogy, it's like theft of cash. The theft is also verifiable on the blockchain.


That's the main risk of bitcoin. If a fundamental, unrepairable flaw is found it's value will go to zero.


Again, you can verify everything on the blockchain.

Firstly, you should understand what it is.
Secondly, no, you shouldn't "invest" in bitcoin. 
It's a payment system (quite revolutionary at that). Buying any bitcoins (or part of them) in the hope of high returns later won't make it an investment, it's called speculation.
If you cannot understand every word of the abstract of the white paper (not to mention the rest) then you should stay away from it.

I think you didn't understand that bitcoin is not a final, finished product. It still has a long road ahead of it.
You cannot expect a young project like this to be everywhere and to be implemented in the right way immediately.
Having said that, the place you bought the hot chocolate could have used a lot easier method.
At this point It truly shines in ecommerence, e-donations, transfers between individuals and having the opportunity to store and manage your bitcoin wealth independent of any institution.
I'm willing to take the bitcoins off from you If you feel disappointed ;-)

a) if desired item found then buy
b) if nothing found then keep BTC or sell

Diversify your wealth. Don't gamble everything on 1 asset. 
Buy Bitcoin, Litecoin, gold, silver, palladium, property (real estate), some tech stock, long term investments, rare collectibles (avoid junk).
Summarize your savings and divide it as you feel right. I would go with 10% BTC, 10% gold, et cetera.

It really depends, look at the bitcoin foundation as an example. or several of the legitimate and trustable bitcoin companies. they appear in public, they don't hide at any levels.

Buying something with bitcoin obviously equals to realizing it's value by exchanging it to an other product, I avoid buying or cashing out soon after a panic or during a panic.
I think the market matured quite a bit, back then it would took only a FUD post to shake the market. Things are different now, I still think there will be corrections but anyone who waits for a big drop will be disappointed (outlawing the market by the US would make it "crash" for the short term though)

It's hard to get in the first time. There is no guarantee of income obviously.
It's very important to only invest as much as you afford to lose.
In my opinion it is very important to select your time of entry and hardware very carefully.
If you would join the butterfly queue, I don't think it's the best choice. I would wait for the next die shrink and try to place my order among the few hundred units. 
Don't rush it just because you fear that you miss on the opportunity. The difficulty is adjusting for the overall hashrate of the system, so there will be a lot of good entry points if the protocol continues to prove flawless. 
@_date: 2013-10-15 08:46:03

It really depends on your business.
If the bitcoin community needs your services/products you will boom, if not you won't see much sales.
From a long time bitcoin user perspective:
I prefer to spend coins because I'm fed up with all my other options, for me bitcoin is a lot more convenient method. I hate banks and payment processors like paypal.
From a business perspective:
You cannot lose anything really and you get free exposure in the bitcoin scene.
Check out bitpay or similar services. makes the integration easy and they offer very good payment processing fees.
A lot of advantages of bitcoin not very visible now, because it's quite an infant project with relatively few people as of yet (it expands in an impressive pace though)

The downside? You think twice before you waste money on useless things. For the useful things I do not really care that bitcoin can go higher...I need those stuff now.

There is no reason for keeping BTC at a 3rd party.

I'm not even sure why some people are listening to mainstream media when it comes to bitcoin. It's for the people by the people.
Since I'm involved, the media have been spreading misinformation.
Bitcoin is still a powerful tool and works very well (not to mention the possibilities it enables), why would I sell all if **anyone** puts it in a bad light?
This sheep attitude got us into trouble in the first place and warranted the existence of an independent currency.
The most laughable thing is when someone panic sells because of the comments made by greenspan and the like.
Don't expect any of these circles to support it fully. It represents everything they're against, most notably freedom of the average people.

I didn't say that fiat currency is the cause. It's just a tool to maintain the current system which is utterly flawed and forces people in a specific way of life (never ending rat race basically, making our top elite more and more powerful)
I think it would require such a significant change in the way we think about our world and way of life it's nearly impossible to make things right at this point.
I understand the problem of overpopulation, which is quite a bizarre subject in these days. Most people don't accept the fact that we are "animals" just like any other animal on this planet. (especially the religious dumbfucks - pardon the language)
Now, what happens when - due to various changes - a species reach unsustainable levels of population...People don't like to think about this and it's like passing the bomb to generation to generation until the problem gets so severe there won't be pretty solutions :)

It's quite a deep subject, I would advise that you do your own proper research.
Bitcoin is a peer to peer payment system. It enables you to transfer bitcoin frictionless to anyone/anywhere with an internet connection.
Mind, that it's still an infant project under development.
Volatility so far affected only short term users. I expect price swings to continue for years.


Considering the potential, you are not late by any means, but consider the risks and invest only that you can afford to lose.
@_date: 2013-12-18 14:37:49

Anyone who likes the concept of bitcoin and sells in a panic is a moron and deserves to lose money.

@_date: 2013-10-31 11:13:06
I don't agree that it's over hyped. It has a huge potential. No one in their right mind would hype it as an established currency, I believe all the enthusiasts agree on this.
It is a revolutionary concept though and if adoption continue to grow it has the ability to change industries and the way we perceive money.
By that time, the technically illiterate people won't even need to know the now required understanding of basics, they will be presented with only a balance and basically their phone/gadget will be function as their wallet.

Bitcoin would survive completely fine with any number of users.
It could be killed only:
- Internet goes down globally
- Electricity goes down globally
- Fundamental / unrepairable flaw in the protocol
As long as there will be some people accepting the blockchain and value btc, it can't die.
Let assume that ghash.io has malicious intents. Let's assume that they pull off a successful double spend. While the exchange rate would suffer short term, this is far from an unrepairable flaw as honest nodes could continue a fork from before the double spends (something like this happened in 2010 btw).
Every miner has the incentive (eg it's more expensive to attack than to cooperate) to maintain the blockchain and not to work against the community.
@_date: 2013-05-01 07:48:31

You cannot expect stability on an infant market. Newbies always forget that bitcoin is not a finished "product", there's a long way ahead of it.
I don't expect stability for decades. 3bn market cap is so small it can be moved by a lot of entities or group of entities.
The first few years is all about distribution and building infrastructure.
Not to mention the fact that long term users have not been affected negatively so far by any of the price moves.

I love that bitcoin is global. While it's certain that a lot of people will scare away and cause short term dips on regulations or ban, but it doesn't change the fact that people need bitcoin to transact freely and without obscene charges.
People need an option to store their wealth securely and still have full and exclusive control (for basically free).
No matter what some US regulators say or do (or that matter european) I will still embrace and use bitcoin.
"Our leaders" negative action against BTC yet again raises the question: How much freedom do we really enjoy? Are we really want this system to achieve and maintain full control?
