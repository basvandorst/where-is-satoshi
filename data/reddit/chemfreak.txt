Were you expecting immediate returns?  If that's the case you are right, Bitcoin was a dumb investment.
If you weren't expecting returns for years, then hold tight, this dip, or crash, most likely means nothing in a year.
Everyone has said it, Bitcoin is not a get rich quick investment.  Don't be dumb, those don't exist without extreme luck and timing.

Do you consider ethereum an altcoin?  Because it is providing services and uses that Bitcoin isn't and probably never will be used for (I have not heard of s single developer refuting this).
@_date: 2018-01-16 15:25:09
It's the household name of crypto.  Everyone has heard of Bitcoin, almost no one has heard of any altcoins.
Bitcoin has the most and my opinion most skilled set of developers; they are innovating while most others are happy to be in the scene.  Innovation is what will be needed to survive the long term.
For the short term, ethereum saw a bull run.  Historically the ethereum/btc exchange rate is pretty stable.  This means either something extremely abnormal happened, or Bitcoin will have a bull run to catch up, or ethereum will crash back down.  I lean towards Bitcoin having a bull run but I'm a believer.  I still think ethereum is underpriced so I subscribe to ethereum crashing the least.

@_date: 2018-01-17 23:16:51
You don't have to trade at the bottom, as long as you buy lower than when you sale, you still "make money".
Yes that is still hard to determine, I did not guess it would go under 15k in january, and didn't think it would go under 10k today.
I still made a profit if you consider btc the underlying asset.  I sold at 17k and bought back in at 15k.
Yes I have less USD invested, but I made btc without ever spending a dime more of my "earned" money.
@_date: 2018-01-04 01:50:42
This initially was my plan, invest check.  Hodl. Check.  Pull half out when I double my fiat investment and let the rest ride to the moon.
Then I realized, after I'm still hodling 4x my initial  fiat, I would just blow the cash anyways. So I started buying again (at the peak but IDC honestly).
If I lose it all, so be it, I just missed out on a few toys I would have otherwise not needed.
@_date: 2018-01-24 20:19:42
I am too.  The industry is not ready for mass adoption.  No network can support even a fraction of what fiat systems do today.
LN needs to be adopted, new interfaces need to be developed, new wallet technologies ect.
It is fine that all bitcoin is doing is fueling the "Hodl" mentality right now.  Give it a few more years guys.

But he's talking about bitcoin used to hedge.  Futures are not consolidated in bitcoin anyway, its just a cash gamble.  But it is very common in the futures market to hedge your short position with the asset you are shorting.  This is what he is talking about.

That very well could have been the deal.  No way bit pay can accept eating high tx fees for $5 purchases.

@_date: 2018-01-17 23:08:49
Only if you bet everything.
I have never bought more than I could afford, and yes I recently just bought more.
But if it drops to $0, my life literally won't change because I'm not expecting to cash out anytime in the next 10 years anyway.  It's also not my only investment, so even if in 10 years it's worth 0, I'm still OK.
Everytime is hits a new monthly low, I buy more.  I want the bubble to burst in some ways, I would love to buy at $4000 again, or $1000 or whatever the low ends up being.
For me the amount of USD in my btc portfolio doesn't matter, for me it's how much BTC I have, and for that reason the crash is great.
@_date: 2018-01-20 01:42:59

Well one roadblock could be that businesses do not pay the fees anyway.  The sender pays the fees.  Why take risk when the consumers can?
Eventually market forces will make them adopt (competitors who DO have LN), but I think people are crazy to think it will go easy.

If exchanges are corrupt enough to claim to be backed by USD and not actually backed by USD, then they are corrupt enough to inflate the price of tether through artificial means.

Maybe, but maybe not.  The dream is that bitcoin replaces fiat right?  Well that won't happen unless everyone adopts it, at least in a demographic.
I'm only advocating the spread widespread informing of what cryptocurrency is (it isn't something you can buy at a discount, any more than you can buy EUROs at a discount), and to stop misinformation.
If I WAS a proponent of Bitcoin Cash, which I am not obviously, I would hope I believe in it enough to not have to hide facts.  If the product is good, it will be adopted.  Confusing people/burning people out on it will only help in the short term, it obviously will have the opposite effect long term as people decide never to support it because they *felt* scammed.

Yes, some coincidences are fine.  But all of them literally pointing to market manipulation?
Price plummets, exchange is open for all, let the price hit the floor!
Price goes up?  Better cockblock the every day person (most people use coinbase, including me until today), while the big boys have reign to buy back.
Absolutely disgusting.  I'm sure this isn't new for people who are used to day trading in stock markets, but holy fuck my mind is blown.

Bitcoin is mostly being used as a store of value.  Over any timeframe outside of a few months Bitcoin pretty much can't be beat as a store of value.
It's like a better gold.  Why do people want to hold gold?  To hedge against inflation is why.
For countries like the US, this doesn't seem to be a big deal because our inflation "is under control". But there are tons of countries in pretty much every continent besides NA that double digits inflation is a good year.  Why the fuck would you hold onto fiat that is worth half as much in a year?

The problem is Warren buffet giving Bitcoin praise is bad for business right now, whether he wants to invest or doesn't want to invest.  If he doesn't invest in it, praises it, it goes up in price and he "missed out".  If he is investing, it makes sense for him to shut his mouth about it until he has his share *before* singing it praise to pump the price.
Listening to "made" businessman on investment advice has to always be looked at with them making money, not you, in mind.  Sometimes that advice can overlap but not always.
Look at Roger Ver and his crusade against Bitcoin, and he is as green as it gets for big money manipulation.
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:15:19
Based on simple mathematics.  Even if lightning network is used for 99% of transactions, it still won't scale to a global economy, which is what Bitcoin is about.
I don't think people realize how little transaction is happening compared to the very real scenario of mass adoption.
Edit: And even with full 100% LN adoption an outside party could in a sense "DDOS" the mempool.  Yes it would cost money, but people in the crypto industry are rich enough to do that if they wanted to.
@_date: 2017-12-04 23:02:34
My parents have responded quite the opposite, which actually is a bit scary.
They told me they were going to have me help them invest some in bitcoin during Christmas when they are visiting.
It is scary because no matter what people say, it is a high risk investment, the volatility is proof of that (I think the Risk/Reward is absolutely insanely good though).  The biggest part of me wants them to invest so maybe they can retire a couple years early, but a small part of me is yelling at them to not do it, I don't want to feel responsible for them losing part of their retirement.
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:15:48


I am in the same boat.  I like Bitcoin, I like the idea of Lightning Network, and even more so the general idea that we have very enthusiast developers that are willing to innovate new technologies for and alongside bitcoin.
As far as coinbase ect adoption of lightning network, and the cast study of Segwit, I believe based upon my admittedly limited understanding, that LN will be harder to implement than Segwit.
Segwit did not really add much of another layer potential security problems.  LN is a completely new platform that while it does interact with the blockchain, transactions happen OFF the chain.    This is a legitimate reason why companies that handle big amounts of bitcoin daily would be hesitant to adopt it quickly.  And if we are to take coinbase's reason for taking so long to implement Segwit, security is that reason.  Therefore how can we expect the adoption to be seamless and/or quick?

Step back a bit please.  I have $0 in bcash but this is a bit out of line.  There is no proof Bcash had anything to do with this decision for one, so retaliation on baseless accusations shouldn't be supported.
Fees ARE a problem, core realises that, and you should too.  Based upon Valve's statement the decision was grounded in logical thought.  Steam is mostly a marketplace for purchases $60 and under.  Even a $6 fee is 10% of that so it is not economical for their customers and by their admission they are receiving complaints about the fees even though it is out of their control.

The past 2 days have not been natural market forces only.
That being said, I agree, hodl.  One thing that I think is good news, is Ethereum has barely dipped, in fact its up on the week.  The ETH/BTC exchange is obviously growing because of this.  This means instead of everybody getting out of crypto, they are just hedging with Ethereum.  Those people will be back. I personally hedged too, but I wish I would have waited longer before buying back into btc because my gains would have been bigger, as it is though I saw a 5% increase on my *total holdings of btc* that I did hedge.  Yes I'm down if you look at just USD, but I gained BTC which is awesome.

No most likely the opposite.  More *new* money will flood in.  And if history repeats itself like it has many times so far with bitcoin, old hodlers won't sell enough to cover the new buyers, therefore causing a rise.
But don't listen to me only, I'm hugely green at this.
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:53:11
I think what he's saying is that LN eventually has to commit to the blockchain; LN congregates many transactions which are then written on the blockchain.
If miners can still spam the blockchain, even LN fees can become a problem (even if channel closes out once a day or week for example), if we look at *scale* which is the same problem we are in now.  My point is, LN is and cannot be the only solution, only a piece of the puzzle.
@_date: 2017-12-28 04:00:40
LN will not take away the possibility to make on chain transactions.   To me that's a huge distinction.

@_date: 2017-12-19 21:11:08

@_date: 2017-12-19 20:52:26
I don't disagree with you.  And I am probably in the minority here but I don't have a problem with bitcoin cash getting exposure, as long as it isn't advertised as something it's not.  It's not bitcoin core, and it is malicious to not inform ignorant buyers of that fact.
I think more knowledge about cryptocurrency in general is what we need.  There is so much more than Bitcoin Core and all the buzzwords, and if we want mass adoption and true currency, people have to be educated.

Laziness got me, not a willingness/unwillingness.
I was explained in detail what Bitcoin was, and offered one of the best GPUs at the time to start my own mining for 1/3 the retail price by a coworker.
I said yes but never followed through.  I think bitcoin was either $6 or $16 at that time, it is fuzzy.
@_date: 2017-12-02 18:47:26
Well it will become more centralized, but that kind of is the trade-off which is good.  Less secure but quicker and more efficient than on chain transactions.  Once again the analogy between a debit card and a wire transfer; someone can steal your debit card/cc and use funds but it is much harder to fake a wire transfer (Bitcoin transaction).
Having industries (centralization  if you want to call it that) I believe is healthy for the crypto industry *in the private sector*, competition builds growth and innovation. As long as we keep the actual currency and on chain transactions decentralized I feel the original vision is intact. In my mind the line in the sand is written very clearly, we have to be able to have transactions written on the block chain and a finite amount of currency no matter what.
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:27:51
The thing I'm most afraid of in holding Bitcoin Cash is what happens when/if the exchanges finally hand out their customers promised forked currency.
Even if you don't subscribe to the pump and dump/manipulation conspiracy theory, if even 10% of those funds get dumped for Bitcoin, or really anything else, the price of Cash is going to go down.
So for me, if the gains are similar now, no reason to hold cash as it seems to be higher risk.

So is it like having a checking account vs a savings account that do not automatically draft off of each other?
For example, I put $500 in my checking account that is tied to my debit card.  I then can use that debit card to make quick purchases.  However if I try to spend more than $500 I would have to take money out of my savings (wallet) for a fee (transaction fee).
The only difference is both parties have to have a "checking" account that can communicate?
Does my analogy fail somewhere?  I'm trying to understand the potential.
@_date: 2017-12-04 23:11:28
Volatility will keep it from being massively adopted as a currency. Even if they volatility is a massively uphill trend, it is bad for use as currency.  Ever increasing value means people would rather use conventional fiat, as their bitcoin is most likely to have more purchasing power in a week than it does today while their dollar is not.  This is why deflation is bad for an economy, people tend to save instead of spend which halts economic activity.
Of course volatility in the downward trend is even worse, the problem won't be people wanting to spend bitcoin, rather vendors accepting bitcoin as payment (look at any "failed" currency such as Zimbabwe ect).  Currency is best for an economy if it is non volatile, which in a nutshell is what the fed is supposed to regulate.
Bitcoin being volatile and thus a store of wealth is OK for now though, that gives us time to add the features (such as lightning network) that will enable it to actually be massively adopted.  Look at how the exchanges faired to a slight increase in use, now think about a systemic problem instead of a segregated problem.
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:06:47
People think of saving Bitcoin as an all or nothing endeavor. Why not wait until you can pay off your debt x2, then take out half and pay off that debt while keeping a lot still in the market.  Then no matter what happens you made a smart financial decision, even if it crashes and even if it goes to the new moon.

People are literally so uninformed that they think they can only buy in quantities of a whole bitcoin.
And yes, people are uninformed enough to think they can get a "deal" on bitcoin, and purchase it for 90% off.  It has happened and it will continue to happen.
These are normally considered scams, as they happen all the time where someone thinks they are getting a deal of a lifetime because they were misled.  I'm not saying Bitcoin Cash is a scam, but it is showing qualities that scams have, including this.

You're not wrong but I'm personally glad it isn't used as fiat yet; the infrastructure and technology isn't there yet.

And on that day bcash will have a dip, maybe even crash.
Which is probably why they haven't released it yet, keep the price inflated for whatever manipulation they are up to.  Maybe to sell off whatever they can before then, maybe it was a long con to try to force people to adopt bcash.  Maybe something else I can't think of.  Both the lack of segwit and the long wait for bitcoin cash to be available just screams of scumbaggery to me.

Bigger blocksize increases the resources needed to run a full node/mine which eventually will be unable to be ran by anyone besides corporations/the rich.
This literally for me makes Bitcoin no better than USD controlled by the FED and banks.
No amount of max block size would support all the world's future transactions on the main blockchain.
Read both sides here  .
I'm not saying a blocksize increases isn't a part of a long term solution, but just increasing blocksize without other measures will surely kill what bitcoin is supposed to be.
BCH team has announced nothing that they even care about the very real problem of blocks too big/not able to be big enough. 
For the record I'm super pissed/frustrated about the current fees, and I see no way for 1mb blocks to ever scale so I would be OK with an increase as long as it was part of a long term plan by consensus.

On 1 hand I agree with you, completely dismissing their wisdom is foolish.
On the other hand, (and speaking of specifically Buffet here) why would he ever give free financial advice without it benefiting him as well?
If your business is investment, publicly sharing your investment advice has to have motive.
There are plenty of "pure" motives, but there are some not pure motives it could be as well.  I won't speculate as that isn't fair.  But I think, in general, to blindly follow them is just as likely to end in a poor financial decision as dismissing them entirely.
Even with the best case scenario for motivation, Buffet would only publicly endorse an investment when he's already priced in, and tell people to sell after he's already sold the investment himself.  Even in this scenario you're going to get burned without good timing.
Let me frame it this way.  How many people are self made millionaires because of blindly following the investment advice of Warren Buffett?  By self made I mean using public knowledge gained from Buffet not insider knowledge.  I think that number is 0.

Yes.  It is rare but it is possible.
Gold is tested in many ways, one way is by measuring density, another is to perform chemical reactions on small scrapings of the gold.
One way that some counterfeiters have got away with unsuspecting buyers is to make an alloy (different metals) with the same density as gold.  For a completely hypothetical example, a lead and copper alloy. Pure gold has a density that no other pure metal has.  Lead is denser than gold, copper is less dense, some percentage alloy would have the same density as gold.  
Then all the counterfeiter needs to do is layer the alloy with enough real gold that it passes visual inspection and any acid test checks out. 
Of course this isn't a perfect counterfeit; we are not talking about alchemy here. If a buyer melted the bar down this would never work. But I have seen some pretty shitty counterfeit US currency and this would qualify if those shitty counterfeits do.
That being said this chart is still shit.  For example being stable/consistent is very very important to any currency, if we're considering currency that drives economic activity, way more important than many/most of attributes listed, and it doesn't show up anywhere.  Like most things crypto (especially on reddit), it's propaganda with hints of truth.

Yea, if there is 150 mil per day flowing in, with none flowing out, then the price would be rising.  There is $~13,500,000 worth of Bitcoin mined daily so even if all these coins were sold as soon as they were mined the price would still go up.

I actually think, as long as there are no big corrections for the rest of the year, 20k on December 31st is a great sign.  
If it's super volatile (20% + corrections) and 20k on December 31st, maybe not such a great sign.

Can you elaborate a little bit on why this is the case?
I thought 1 advantage of quantum computing was that it could potentially calculate many things at a time, albeit with possibly less accuracy.  I may be completely off here though.
For me, hashing fits the "calculate many at one time" perfect for this.
Even if half the time the hash that comes back isn't accurately a correct solution, it would take almost 0 computing power to "double check" the accuracy with conventional computing, as you would only need to check 1 hash at a time.

Sorry you have been banned, I don't agree with that type of censorship.
I'm not the person you were replying to, but if bitcoin core ever ends on the end of a fork that has less proof of work, then they are not working on the true bitcoin.  That's literally how it works. The most work/consensus has been the measure of the main chain since the white paper.
People taking personal stake and name calling (both sides) shilling, claiming real/not real, publicly and privately misleading are literally the opposite of what bitcoin means to me.  Bitcoin does not/can not have a central authority and retain its identity.  Bitcoin is not 1 person (roger ver), not 1 group (Core), it is pure democratic consensus.
And for the record, there are many decisions I don't agree with the consensus on (I think delaying a blocksize increase is risky, at the very least it unquestionably will slow down adoption when tx fees are high), but that's the beauty of it not being all about me.
My advice, if you are truly passionate about Bitcoin Cash spend your time educating people not misinforming.  You have value in the argument that bigger blocks make bitcoin cash better.  You have no value in telling people this makes Bitcoin Cash the "real" bitcoin.  You will only serve to piss off people who mistake 1 for the other.  That's why I'm so confused that a smart man like Roger Ver (not being sarcastic, I think he is quite intelligent) would hurt the long term image of bitcoin cash for small quick adoption.

Ethereum was never marketed or created as an alternative to Bitcoin, it has just turned into one by market forces.
Ethereum was created for smart contracts and to enable other projects, not as a currency.
Yes it uses blockchain , but it has innovated from there into something vastly different.  Bitcoin is going that direction too with projects to enable smart contracts on chain, but I personally think this is a mistake.  That just takes development time away from making it a better currency, potentially makes it worse as a currency (more transactions), and if it does go that way then I'm sure decisions will be made based upon both uses of the coin rather than its main function (a currency).   A new way to process payments in the pipeline?  Better not mess up the smart contracts functionality... It isn't compatible?  Ok , well, let's scrap the idea then.  This is what I'm afraid of.

Saying a shooting happened with an illegal gun means that all gun laws are silly/worthless is quite literally ignorance.  Any barrier we can put up to make guns harder to get, consequences sharper, or to treat the people before the flip will help reduce the amount of shootings.

Bitcoin is highly volatile both in the up and down direction price wise.
The Zimbabwe currency is even more volatile, and it is only down.
Bitcoin lost about 60% of it's value in 5 months.  The Zimbabwe currency is inflating at 77% a month (most recent stat I could find, October 2017).  It has not and will not go up in value.

They way I read it does not mean they get the same amount of bitcoin back.
If it was an asset valued in US dollars, then they could just give that value of bitcoin back.
For example (making up numbers here) they had 10 bitcoin valued at $6000, they would give give them 1 bitcoin now valued at $6000.
Everything I have read is the courts found that they owed them their monetary value of the bitcoin back not the number of actual bitcoin.

Thanks for the question.
My answer, hardware wallets are best for security purposes.  For most people though they are not needed.  I don't use one but I have used other methods to feel secure.
My "storage" wallet is electrum.  I generated the seed on a fresh install of an old computer, and I only ever "access" the wallet from that computer (if I want to send Bitcoin ***from*** that address).  I also have a copy of my keywords with 2 fake words in the passphrase locked in a fireproof safe, and another copy with my brother. If someone steals either key I feel I likely will have time to transfer the funds.  I have another protection that I haven't told anyone just in case.
I will eventually own a hardware wallet, but for now I don't think the risk/reward is enough.  I am only willing to spend around 1% (probably less) of my bitcoin's value on protecting said value.  If a trezor is $100 I would have to own $10000 in Bitcoin for me to feel the risk is too much to not invest in additional security.
It may all seem complicated and scary, but the crypto scene is like the wild west right now.  It is so early in it's technological age that everything we have now (I'm including hardware wallets) will get better and easier over time.  I'm confident the current wallet technology will seem archaic with 5 years more of development.  
I also have smaller amounts in a couple exchanges (mostly for day trading) and an everyday wallet on my phone.  If any of that is stolen I will be pissed but I would get over it.

"I often go out of my way to find things I strongly disagree with them on so that I can maintain a healthy level of criticality when they say something else that requires careful examination."
I will use this. I am very very scared of being part of the "echo chamber" to use cliche terms. For this reason I normally know more about the oppositions point than my own point, I want to understand their point of view to reinforce mine. For example, I consider myself more liberal than conservative, but I know more about conservative's viewpoint on issues than liberals.
Also on the politics topic, I often ask these two questions when someone is very pro-trump for example: Can you name 3 things you like about Clinton or Obama? Can you name 3 things you dislike about Trump?
It really doesn't matter what they answer that is telling. What matters is if they **can** answer.

You are right only if you believe there isn't incentive also to make the technology better for economic reasons as well.  If mining continues to grow and people have to turn to renewable energy for their operations, the one who will make the most is not the one with the biggest mining farm, it is the one who comes up with the most efficient solar panel/other renewable technology to sell to said farm and all his competitors.

I'm not against improvements to the block chain to make transactions easier/faster, that is the dream.

You didn't. I've seen sell order walls bigger than that be eaten up in seconds.

I think people have bots setup to create artificial walls then cancel them when it gets close.  This is to try to keep the price down.  I'm assuming it is at least partially effective judging by this post.  It gives people cold feet.

I'm maybe not more knowledgeable than you at quantum computers, but the tasks that they will be good at will be performing many tasks of the same nature **simultaneously** while a normal computer has to perform the calculation consecutively.
A hash function really isn't that complicated, it is calculated the same way every time. The difficulty comes in the **amount** of calculations.  See where this is going? Quantum computers can calculate something specific very "quickly", or rather, simultaneously.  Therefore my very admittedly not very educated brain thinks breaking bitcoin would be a good candidate to test some advanced quantum computer on.  Now I realize we are not even close to that theoretical "advanced quantum computer". Just bitcoin's security seems like it is the type of problem quantum computers could solve.

This is from their insurance policy page:
*Digital currency is not legal tender, is not backed by the government, and digital currency accounts and value balances on Coinbase are not subject to Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or Securities Investor Protection Corporation protections.*
That wording has me scared.  Later on it tells you how your cash balance is insured though.  But the definition of crypto not being legal tender and then them saying cash is insured by this this and this is enough for me to nope out.
My take is that USAA FDIC is involved in the insurance of cash balances, but not involved in insuring crypto in the "wallets".

Devil's advocate because I generally agree with you.
On the exchange's perspective: Listing a coin with a bad reputation hurts their reputation.  Having to list every coin costs money, and possibly reduces their systems potential security if every coin has a different protocol. A big point of the bitcoin community is they want to let pure market forces reign supreme.  I would NOT want to list certain coins/tokens if I was running a business, so stopping that is counter intuitive to what many of us are advocating for.
On the user's perspective: More coins confuses users. Especially in the case of bitcoin forks, which bitcoin to buy? Which one is "real" (up to debate, what does the real bitcoin mean?"  More coins makes it easier for new people to make dumb decisions on their first few purchases and make them advocate against crypto.

It's not magical thinking, its logical thinking.  Bitcoin cannot and will not continue going up until it's a trillion, 10 trillion, then 100 trillion.  There is a point where it's use as a store of value is capped out.  People are delusional if they think it will never stop growing in value.

No, but there has never been a time where an extremely volatile asset was something like bitcoin.  It really is a revolutionary idea.
Edit: Read your question again.  Yes there have been many times in history where an asset has gradually become more stable.  Pretty much any new commodity follows this pattern.  Normally this is because of supply and demand reasons, which I can't say is the case for bitcoin.

I don't disagree with anything you said regarding bitcoin there.  The reason I have 80% of my portfolio in bitcoin isn't because it's the first, which really ***is*** relevant no matter what people say, it's because of the innovation the teams working on bitcoin are coming up with.  Blocksize increase, mining algorithm tweaks, a couple changes in confirmation rules, this isn't innovating at all and no one could convince me it was.
Coins that are not innovating after they are implemented I am very confident will not survive.
That's also the reason ethereum makes up the other 20% of my portfolio, the team is still innovating the platform plus it is not in direct competition with bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-03-31 03:03:34
I've done this too.  I'm super bullish on both bitcoin and ethereum.  My only goal with trading is to always trade for a net gain of ethereum or btc.  If I can't, I'm OK hodling as I believe both are going to moon.
I've made big gains on trading if you look at the amount of BTC/ETH I have since I started.
I also have restrictions on myself so I don't trade too much.  For example, I made a lot of my BTC and ETH gains when it was at ~.1 BTC to ETH.  It has since crashed to .058 BTC/ETH.  I did lose some but I was able to make more because I had a lot in BTC (~70% btc 30% eth).  Now I'm closer to 50/50 but I've also made gains when its all converted into 1 or the other currency.
Never once have I considered going from BTC--&gt;Fiat or ETH--&gt;Fiat.  It's always crypto to crypto.

It kind of has to be used a speculative investment until the price hits a critical level then stabilizes.
It is universally accepted (which holy shit is it rare for economists to agree) in economics that a currency that is unstable is a very poor currency.  This goes for inflation *and* deflation.  For inflation, consumers want to buy goods but produces don't want to sell as currency is worth less tomorrow than it is today; this stagnates economic activity making everyone worse off.
In deflation, consumers want to save (and mass saving is EXTREMELY bad for the economy) and producers want to sell asap as currency earned will be more tomorrow than today; this stagnates economic activity which makes everyone worse off.  That's literally the HODL mentality in economic terms. 
Therefore it makes sense when bitcoin is so volatile that it isn't being used as a currency.  I know dozens of people who own bitcoin, think of it as a currency, and not a single one has made more than 2 or 3 transactions, yet they hold a good amount of BTC.  As long as it keeps rising as quick as it has been, it will not be massively used as a currency.  There is a certain critical mass (I have no idea what price) where the currency will have "topped out" as far as its worth as an investment tool.  That is the point where real adoption as a currency will start.

There is still ethereum classic.  The same thing can happen to Bitcoin, and it can be argued it already has every time there was a fork.
Just because the bailout fork won out as the dominant currency doesn't mean it had to, if the majority of the community didn't want the fork they could have chosen not to put their hashing power towards ethereum.
It's just like Roger Ver saying BCash is the real Bitcoin, he doesn't get to decide, core doesn't get to decide, majority rules.
Even so I do agree ethereum is way less decentralized in many ways, besides the mining of course.  That's ok, ethereum never has and never wanted to offer what Bitcoin offers.

Asking you as you seem like one of the most informed here.
What type of taxes are there for Bitcoin I didn't buy with USD?
For example, If I have bought .5btc with USD, but from day trading BTC to ETH and back and now I have .6btc.
If I understand correctly, I have to pay capital gains tax when I sell Bitcoin (current value - initial investment * 20% for long term investments). However, if I just sell the .1 btc I still have my .5 I initially bought, and no other USD exchange happened. I'm assuming I still need to claim it somehow, but I have no idea what it would be under.
For the record I haven't sold, but I have made profit in regards to pure btc.

You're not wrong but to discount the growing debt is silly at best.
$71 trillion also is like 75% of the GDP of the world in 2016, so even by that measure it is mathematically unsustainable (keeping inflation at 0, which of course won't be true, as that is obviously the only way to "pay" for the debt at these numbers).
Edit: I'm bad at comprehensive reading.  The $71 trillion is over 10 years, being off by a factor of 10 puts a whole different light on it.  I still think it isn't sustainable in the long run, but I'm no longer sure of that.

1 ICO is going to be the first fully decentralized exchange ledger, one token is going to be the first fully decentralized social platform, one is going to be the first fully decentralized healthcare platform.
If you think Bitcoin is the only use for blockchain, you do not "get it" at all.
I will literally bet all my bitcoin that there will be more than 1 new coin this year that will have greater gains than bitcoin.  What I mean by that, is if you put $100 into bitcoin vs $100 into these coins, at year end your crypto/fiat conversion is the total gains.

It was a success unfortunately if you look at the big picture.  Don't let your own confirmation bias convince you otherwise.
Ask yourself 2 questions while watching this.  
1. Are any/many BCH holders likely to sell after this? 
2. Is anyone who does not hold BCH going to buy after this?
It is almost impossible for press to be so bad that BCH loses; any marketing helps a product that (basically) no one knows about.

That has no impact on this post, or my comment.  When this article was posted, buying bitcoin at any time in 2014 was a bad investment **at that time**. Just like people who bought at 20k, 15k, 10k, 9k ect made a bad investment in this vacuum scenario of ~6 months.  It is UNARGUABLY a horrible short term investment.  You would only have lost value.  That's why this picture is misleading, it says nothing about the long term picture, the underlying tech, it only is reporting facts.

There are a few reason that scaling quickly (blocksize) actually doesn't make sense to me.
First, is the technology isn't ready for adoption anyway.  We need way more user friendly wallets, 3rd party support, and ease of access changes.  Im technologically savvy and I still see the issues.
The more adoption there is, the harder it will become to make changes stick.  For example there were a lot of really good changes to the internet during the beginning that just couldn't stick.  The internet is incredibly inneficient on the base levels compared to what it could be.
Finally, using the internet as an example again , it works so well because it **had** to adapt or it would die.  Because of the scaling issues new solutions had to be innovated.  Bandaid fixes by scaling the blocksize actually stops innovation.

Except bitcoin is freely traded.  I'm not saying it cannot be easily gamed, but when there's more than $100,000,000 of Bitcoin traded daily, your example of buying 1 dollar of a trade restricted coin makes little sense

Yea and I am and I do :).  Just bought more about 3 hours ago actually.
I'm bullish long term always have been.  I have a hard time recommending buying in to someone else though, knowing they will likely not have steady hands like I have currently.

People are delusional if they think Bitcoin, especially as it is now, could ever kill banks let alone governments.
It can sure disrupt the system in such a way that things will change however; blockchain technology is incredibly powerful and useful.

Definitely a downward trend.

You're right, didn't see the "negative" before the correlation.  My bad.

He's about the only person I have ever listened to/read/watched that can explain bitcoin in a way that I actually understand.
Maybe it's because he is knowledgeable, maybe its because he's able to dumb it down to my level, maybe it's because he doesn't bore me yet I still am able to digest some technical analysis, or maybe its because he is such a good public speaker.  Regardless, he is a big reason many of us are so invested (mentally not literally) in bitcoin.

My comment couldn't be more broad.  I didn't point at anyone, in fact I used "we" because I consider myself ignorant of a bunch of stuff.
I actually think the average Bitcoin user is miles ahead of the general population in regards to open-mindedness.
However I really don't like how defensive you are.

What fundamentals do you speak of?  All curves I have been able to generate are way higher than that in 2030.
Just curious what data you are using for my own research.
@_date: 2018-04-08 17:07:36
No I'm not, I just wanted to be educated as I'm ignorant of the matter.  My point was your example made no sense for Bitcoin, this whole thread **is about Bitcoin** I'm very aware market manipulation not only can occur, it is occurring all the time.
Thank you for the additional examples, my ignorance on the topic is a little less because of you.

He's stating the charts and precedent make a good case for a rally.
As much as you would like to think nothing can be gleamed from this type of information, a lot of the richest people in the world made their fortune partly by these methods.
That being said, there's a tiny minority that actually consistently make money and likely this talking head is not one of them, so there's that.

Linear, exponential, polynomial.  Using data from 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, and the whole set.
Extending the moving average...

For me, Availability bias works more for the opposite point of view.
People thinking bitcoin is not going to rise are looking at the short term instead of zooming out.  By definition, Availability Bias are opinions based upon immediate examples.  Bitcoin crashing is more immediate then our last ATH.
@_date: 2018-04-03 21:26:22
I understand the chart, and I don't see it failing.  It is not stable but neither is any other coin.
Zoom out further and see if you can explain that with the same lens.

The US stock exchange and commodity markets are manipulated like crazy, and they are regulated out of their nose. Bitcoin, by design, is unregulated. It IS being manipulated and it WILL be manipulated further.

I'm a chemical engineer major btw.  So yes, I can maths.
I have also taken a grand total of 2 psychology courses.  I hated both.  That doesn't mean it has no merit or that I couldn't learn something.

I think we should be looking to people *who don't blindly follow 1 side or another* as unbiased and a good source of information.
Someone who is 100% BTC or 100% BCH is not reliable, there is bias there.

Did I ever accuse you of being a robot?  I'm very confused right now.

Once I was enlightened by this idea price hasn't mattered basically at all to me.
I just watch my BTC (and ETH) wallet grow, and that is exciting to me.
I'm sure when the price is &gt;$20000 again I won't be able to help myself, but for now I am really really content to see my BTC grow as I likely will never see it grow at this rate again.

Actually the opposite is true most of the time.  At least when I had my psychology courses, one thing females typically find attractive is "security" which in a large part is "financial security" aka having boats of money attracts the females.

I wouldn't link this to anyone.  This screams "terribly biased propaganda".  Lay off the memes and characterizations and it would be more effective.

I literally don't understand how people don't understand this.
Buy low sell high is a known mantra.  Yet people always do the opposite, and I can't for the life of me figure out why

Me too almost exactly. I have a healthy 401k and an IRA.  Somehow I look at those 2 as the hedge for my future though, as I truly believe in bitcoin.  I plan to HODL almost indefinitely.
I have a price in mind to liquidate half my Bitcoin position, which is the price of buying a house outright or a very very big down payment.
@_date: 2019-05-24 00:13:58
I mean I get it, it's playing a similar role that current financial systems do.
But, I do not believe the world can exist without 3rd parties.  Especially in a free market where people will pay for a service that meets their needs.
 
It doesn't take away the ability of people to make on chain transactions or use an alternative service if a company (or government) gets out of line.
