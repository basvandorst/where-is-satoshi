They are clearly correlated since if you want to mine in the long term you need to be profitable. 
If you consider coins that have the same algorithm, then the hashrate will definitely be in proportion to the coins price ratio, otherwise there would be an arbitrage opportunity.

Think that what you do by settting it up may end up securing something worth a lot of money. So take your time to be sure you are doing it right, And then you won’t freak out when the price shoots up.

The way I see the ignition:
The price is down and most if not all miners are unprofitable. At this point most probably need to sell all the bitcoins they mine to cover costs and hopefully they have a bit of extra to stay alive. 
Then the halvening comes and they can now suddenly sell only 1/2 of what they use to sell. Since the demands remains the same albeit low, prices start to climb
At some point, miners become profitable again, and now they don’t need to sell 100% of what they mine. So the bitcoins on offer decline further, and prices continue to rise.
The rest is investors starting to notice, demand rises, FOMO etc. Leading up to the bubble.
Of course some people anticipate that which is why the prices start to rise a bit before the halving, but I do ´t think it changes this rough picture.

Distance doesn’t matter for Bitcoin \o/

Probably in France given the elegance of the bitcoin whitepaper xD

It all based on trust that other people will accept it AND that the central bank won’t print too much of it

We were all taken by surprise with how short the bottom lasted!

Interesting article. They have 5.1 billion under management and it looks like rhey would use up to 4 million to buy crypto. So about 1/1000 of the portfolio.
A quick google search and I found that there is around 40 trillions USD under management by pension funds (in the 22 countries selected in the study i found), so if they end up investing with the same ratio we would have 40 billions usd buying crypto! That would definitely move the market a bit!

This doesn’t scare me because we have Bitcoin!

Maybe they also had to sell because of the cost of the mining war

I think the date is a deadline - withdraw your coins by then. If everyone tries to withdraw at exactly the same time its almost a ddos attack and not helpful.

I think a contentious hard fork like bitcoin cash last year was one of the worse thing that could happen to bitcoin, weakening the scarcity argument.
Now we can see bitcoin has survived it and the forked coin is dying down, and it gives me more confidence than ever in bitcoin!
