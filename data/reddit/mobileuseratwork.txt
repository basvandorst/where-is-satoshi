Apple doesnt realise this kind of anti-innovation behaviour they are pushing is just killing off what made their phone unique: the well maintained and bountiful app store.
Being restrictive stops people making apps. They also seem to mess with the way the app store works (searches, lists, new apps etc.), less apps less quality, less quality less downloads.

Edit: seems the guy posting info on the call didnt want it public.
Edit2: this guy posted details about the hold music while on the call, and then posted details about the outcome that contained personal information. Hence guessing mods nuked it. Third times the charm?

That doesn't sound terribly stupid at all.
Uber HQ sets up server farm to start it off and begin processing the initial coin chain (UBR?). Users running the Uber App (drivers, phone plugged in via USB and connected on the net are best for this) add to the main server farm. Collect a % of return for opting in?

Yeah it was easy when you just ran the Core application. Download, install. 50BTC here. 50BTC there. 
Then video card mining came along, and pool mining. you had to make sure you had the right VGA card, and then signup to a pool (Slush FTW) and then figure out how to get the software going. I was pulling about 1BTC per 24 hours during those mining sessions from a single card. 
However the card cooked itself (heavy vga cooler separated from the board over time) and the replacement under warranty was not compatible. a month later the first hardware farms started showing up and it was game over for the PC rig users. Back then people worked out at the current $1 / BTC it was break even using your home power if it was free.
