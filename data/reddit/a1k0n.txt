The standard CPU-mining code compiles just fine on OS X with a little modification.  If you install the necessary MacPorts/whatever, e.g. py-opencl, you can also run the Python GPU mining code that's out there.  OS X has OpenCL built-in, so it works just fine.  My MacBook Pro has an nvidia chipset in it, though, so the GPU speed is about the same as the CPU speed (~2Mhashes/sec) which is basically infinitesimal compared to what you can get with an ATI-based mining rig.  You might get much better mileage with your setup.
Nobody seems to be providing binaries and frontends for OS X, though, so you pretty much have to be comfortable messing around compiling things in terminal.
Edit: somehow I was totally ignorant of DiabloMiner.  I guess you can just use that.

Yes, it looks like they were mostly coins mined in February/March.

Remember: every time you send any money, you need to re-backup your wallet, as it will put the "change" from each transaction into a new address.  If your backed-up wallet.dat doesn't have the new address (it might, because of some newly-added behavior where it generates 100 addresses to begin with -- but don't count on it!) then your backup doesn't have all your money anymore.
To answer your question directly, though, as long as you are receiving money, then your client doesn't even need to be running.  You just need to hold the private key to the address that receives the money to send it somewhere later.
The contents of your wallet is a set of addresses and their private keys.  The money isn't "in" your wallet, per se -- it's in the block chain transaction log for the addresses you own.  Your wallet just gives you the right to spend the money present in your addresses.

There is a client which does the general bitcoin transaction P2P stuff, but it has a crappy CPU miner built in so most people use a more specialized miner instead of the client.

Hmm, but isn't 2^32 the upper bound on how many hashes are needed for a share, and therefore the average is 2^31 ?

No, if it were deepbit they wouldn't all be blocks with balances of 50, they'd be blocks that had their funds partially/mostly distributed.  These are blocks starting from 2009, so it was just someone who was mining back when it was easy to mine suddenly realizing the value of what they had done two years ago and cashing out.
