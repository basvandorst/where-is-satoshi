watch your porn with her, spice it up a bit.

I wholehartedly disagree. the advertising an american bitcoin bowl would bring more than $375,000 in profit to sites like blockchain and mtgox, then they could open up to other countries

I was interested, now i just think youre a twat.

Im confused as to how he would have managed to scam you with the "same time" method he mentioned.  If it were me, i would have been honestly tempted.
however, thats a pretty cool idea for a website, a holding service that lets two people exchange at the same time using a server side countdown.

paypal. already in dispute.. like i said, im not too bothered, just making sure other people dont get scammed

just by that response, and the fact that he deleted, im guessing you absolutely verbally destroyed him

high taxes - normal taxes +NHS, no need for health insurance. plus we get pensions as standard.

yeah, i wasnt too worried about it, because i can afford it as damage limitation to someone who potentially couldnt. atleast some 16 year old looking for his first investment wont get caught by it

Bitcoin has already "taken off" so to speak, the fact that it is being mentioned in some of the high orders around the world currently is big. really big.. there are also some infrastructure in place where people can use their bitcoins to buy things IRL, so that adds to the criminal "untraceable side to it"
Litecoin is really a gamble, like bitcoin at the start, it was just a currency that people tended to think would bust. the whole question would be "is the success of bitcoin going to help litecoin get exposure" in my opinion, yes. because several bitcoin selling sites also sell litecoin, and im sure some people will just see "a cheap alternative" 
the potential for both of them is quite big.. i have a few of each. keeping my eggs in my basket though..
currently though, go bitcoin.. the market just staggered down a little and from what the past few days have shown, it will still go up again and higher before it plummets properly..
