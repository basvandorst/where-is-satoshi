There isn't one because it's a fact and not opinion

Law of reddit. Can't have a single post without mentioning trump.

I'll try that when I get home. Does that make me re-download the entire block chain? 
@_date: 2017-08-15 13:34:33
Doesn't show anything on block chain.info.. never received or spent. I know for a fact I got these from someone and never spent them. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 00:57:48
when I searched on the block chain explorer websites, they did not show up... am I screwed?

How would I go about recovering those transactions? Any documentation on where to start?
@_date: 2017-08-15 02:20:05
how do I sent new transactions when they were coins I received? 
@_date: 2017-08-19 06:04:34
Do you have a link how to do that? 
@_date: 2017-08-14 22:32:18
I tried sending raw data but it never went through

Sorry I don't fully understand. Someone else sent me the coin(S) in 2013 and it's showing up under transactions but not in balance. Block chain info doesn't seem to show anything though.

How do I do this when it was coins sent to my wallet?
@_date: 2017-08-19 19:09:34
Thanks thanks. I have an old wallet from 2013 (lol yeah one of those) with two transactions that were never confirmed. I'm assuming I lost those bitcoins. I imported the private key to electrum, but nothing shows up.

It's a really good idea, as long as the fees aren't ass
