I’ve got a Satoshi!

The ID and password are sent via email, but I am not sure about the password reset as mentioned by someone else. The person to whom you are replying gave a perfect response.

Their encryption isn't good. I've just tried to register for an account and it literally gives the client ID and password, meaning it isn't encrypted. That is quite naive, as they store usernames and passwords, which can be stolen in an attack.

Yeah, I don’t see encryption there. If it’s being emailed to you in clear text then they store
the data raw.

I’m a relative newbie here (~2 months in), but can someone explain why altcoins go up when BTC goes down and vice versa?

And then there’s me, an eighth-grader.

I bought in at 15k. With this drop, should I also invest into other cryptos (LTC and ETH)? I plan to hodl on, but when should I actually be worried?

We have Jules Verne’s 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea for 20k. That won’t be long.

It’s a liberty steering wheel

Literally everywhere in California (especially Silicon Valley). A 2000 square foot town home runs you $800k-1m.

Oops, I’m no expert in the field. I switched encryption for hashing.
