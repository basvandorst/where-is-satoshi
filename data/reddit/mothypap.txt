This is what gets me excited about bitcoin and crypto. We wade through the price talk everyday but it is worth it to find these gems of info. 
We are going to see a surge in development in the coming months that will be remarkable. I have used lightening and it was incredible. I have used segwit and it instantly reduced fees. I will use bullet proofs to ensure fungibility and (removed: my) privacy. 
All the while others will still be talking about how cheap a transaction is on a chain that's never used and how secure a chain is on a network that's never attacked. 
Edit: Words

This is what first caught me: 
Then read through  twitter as provides more details. 
It's an interesting read and perhaps is a side of the scaling debate that was not focused on when thinking of motives.

Best comment here. Time after time we see commenters complain of 1MB blocks when today, at this very minute, we actually have available 2MB (on average) already here but we just don't use it.

The wallet does not matter. It is just a housing for keys/addresses. Like a purse can hold many different notes or coins. Some wallets hold 20 or more crypto-currencies. bitWallet holds litecoin, bitcoin cash and bitcoin. 
If your coins are in a non segwit address when you send them you will incur a higher fee than sending from a segwit address, no matter what wallet. So for instance, just because bitWallet provides segwit addresses it does not mean that if you hold your coins in bitWallet every transaction benefits from segwit. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 21:01:17
To benefit from segwit it needs to be in a segwit address. Sending from a non segwit address to a segwit address as I understand will not provide a benefit.

I hope they have duplicates
@_date: 2017-12-26 23:09:27
No. That's not how it all works. A wallet is just a collection of keys nothing more. Keys are translated to addresses and address can be segwit or non segwit etc. 
HD wallets allow a seed key to control a series of never ending public keys (this is how the bread wallet can keep changing the receive address and you still see the all coins in your wallet). 
As an example. Take the last public receive key from your bread wallet and put this into a block explorer and what do you see ? Is it all the bits in your bread wallet or just a few ? Where are the other bits kept ? How do they all come together ? What is change anyway ?
To be honest, even using the term address and thinking of coins moving is not really accurate. 
Keep asking the questions ! No one learns otherwise. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 18:09:27
I think business such as Coinbase are not using segwit because it does not solve their main issue of millions of mis managed UTXOs that will cost them more than the btc they contain to move/consolidate. 
This is why they have been pushing base block size increase, pushing bcash and trying to do as much as possible to reduce btc value during times of increased price movements. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 11:37:16
Brings a whole new meaning to cash flow
@_date: 2017-12-26 12:20:20
My understanding is this. 
By putting in your seed from bread to bitWallet you would create the same addresses etc but on another wallet. There would be no movement to a segwit address. 
If you swept the funds from bread wallet to bitWallet (segwit address) then you have effectively transferred the funds to this new segwit address. 
Personally, I would just create a new segwit address on bitWallet and just send the whole funds from bread on the economy fee. 
PS: Please don't throw away any old keys and make sure you keep solid backups of any new ones. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 17:23:11
I take the point but we don't need the GUI to start using segwit or developing segwit enabled services (unless I am missing something). ShapeShift have done this and no doubt found many benefits one of them being cost. 
On the block size we now use block weight and have equivalent of circa 2MB - 4MB to go at. Anyone still wanting a block size increase from 1MB to 2MB either does not understand that we effectively have this now or is misunderstanding the current state. 
As an aside the management of UTXOs is crucial as recently reported with the problems with Coinbase. No amount of segwit will resolve this upcoming issue. I urge all readers to look at their dust transactions and consolidate when they can. It is good practice and in itself will reduce fees and block congestion. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 13:29:18
No probs. I am in the same position as you in that I have btc in bread wallet and want to move to a segwit address so have gone through similar thought processes. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 23:13:51
As I understand it the operation should have no  additional benefit other than transaction validation and processing otherwise the operation itself becomes a race outside of securing the blockchain. 
If hashing itself suddenly had an external value then the neutrality of chain is compromised. Unfortunately it should be as boring and non useful as possible to stop anyone using it other than to secure the bitcoin blockchain, we then at least know anyone doing it is only doing it for this reason. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 17:45:52
Agree 100%. We need businesses (large transaction creators) to adopt this and core not having released a GUI is not an excuse. Almost every large business in the space was calling for increased capacity and we have it here, today. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 10:54:08
Thanks for the reminder. Point well taken. 
Brings me back to one of the core reasons I follow the project. Thanks for the grounding. 
Extract from 'A Cypherpunk's Manifesto'
'Privacy is necessary for an open society in the electronic age. Privacy is not secrecy. A private matter is something one doesn't want the whole world to know, but a secret matter is something one doesn't want anybody to know. Privacy is the power to selectively reveal oneself to the world.'

Is there such a thing as a 1MB block size. Is it actually possible to put this at 2MB ? As far as I understand it is block weight. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 12:14:24
Although I agree with the sentiment I don't think the constant linking of bitcoin core and Blockstream is helpful as it can undervalue what the majority of core devs do who do not work for Blockstream.  
Don't get me wrong Blockstream are great, but we should also celebrate all the core devs many of which are not directly paid to support the bitcoin code.

This gives lots of useful info: 
 on twitter has a wealth of comments on this over the last few days which has triggered my interest. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 17:56:42
Good call on the consolidation. A good piece from 2015 details this out: 
Check out  recent commentary on twitter for some great background on UTXO optimisation. Also the following is a very interesting and conclusions on the last 2 years scaling issues could be drawn from this analysis: 
 
@_date: 2017-12-29 11:07:25
A random internet user but wow. I have only skimmed this but what a body of work. I don't care if this is good/bad/indifferent but knowing you took the time and energy to create something positive for the community ... very impressive. You're in the 1% my friend. I hope you have many positive reasons to use your own guide :)
@_date: 2017-12-24 11:22:25
Is there such a thing as a 1MB block now ? As I understand it it is block weight that is equivalent to. 
When it is discussed about wanting an increase to a 2MB block should that not be a discussion about updating the block weight, especially as segwit provides capacity for an average of 1.7MB going to max at circa 4MB. 
Genuinely interested. Keen to know if I have my thought process wrong. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 20:21:58
Great as a watch only wallet also !
@_date: 2017-12-25 19:16:25
From the segwit Q&amp;A it notes 4MB but as stated has an average (depending on transactions) of 1.6MB to 2MB. However 4MB is possible but highly unlikely and circa 2MB would be roughly the size of a block when looking at the composition of past transactions as a guide if effectively used. 
The following is also a great read: 
@_date: 2017-12-25 20:20:58
Encourage everyone to use this time learning about segwit but also please take the opportunity to consolidate your UTXOs and create some segwit addresses. This will be time well spent and will save you future fees and reduce space consumed on the block chain. A win-win for all.

Please consider donating to the RNLI of the UK. 
These guys save lives each and everyday and make a significant difference. They are supported by volunteers who work 24/7/365 and have been accepting bitcoin for some years now. 
Any donation would support this charity to continue to save lives at sea and around the coast. 
Every bit will help. Thanks for the consideration OP. Your generosity is beyond comprehension. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 22:14:06
I agree. They would need to have a private word in someone's ear though to stop spamming the chain for this to work. Maybe they could develop their own mining farm, who knows. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 20:35:58
If you are in this position then at least transfer to gdax and transfer to your own addresses for no charge. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 20:22:46
Yes. When creating a wallet it will take you through and ask you for a simple wallet or HD. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 14:41:41
This is the reason. Coinbase are here to make money only. Why would they allow you to withdraw for free and then cost them more money than the btc being withdrawn. 
Look at the difficulty charts also. There is a constant pattern now of closing off exit points when difficulty adjusts.  
@_date: 2017-12-24 13:19:41
As today's equivalent block weight for an average set of transactions is circa 1.7MB-2MB do you wish to see 3.4MB - 4MB ?
Again. Keen to understand thoughts on this as I read a lot about doubling block size to 2MB (which does not make any sense now as we talk block weight) when in fact we have the equivalent now if we chose to use it - users are making a choice not to use it by not using segwit but still comment on congestion. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 14:31:25
Sending from a segwit address will save you fees even if you send to a non segwit address. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 11:56:29
The witness data is not increasing. Does this mean anything as I understand they would move in lock step with one another ?
Another poster commented that perhaps what is happening is that non segwit transactions are reduced (due to holidays say) artificially increasing the ratio. 
Appreciate insights.

I have been running a full node for a few years now on a Saphire Edge 4GB 320GB mini pc. It was great but unfortunately bit the dust yesterday. 
I kept this in my living room and used my TV as an adhoc monitor when needed. However the fan was a little noisy. 
Can anyone recommend an alternative mini pc that is fan-less that would be a suitable replacement ?
 
@_date: 2017-12-25 20:27:36
Coinbase will not implement segwit as it does not help them with their main problem of miss management of millions of UTXOs. This will cost them more to resolve than the btc held. 
The only way to resolve this is to reduce the price of bitcoin or increase base block size. No amount of segwit or lightening will resolve it. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 22:20:36
Fully agree. There are only upsides by using segwit by private and business users alike. I look forward over the next months to see the reduction of calls to increase block size and just getting on with supporting efficient use of the already increased space we have. 
A great read on batching if you have not seen it: 
@_date: 2017-12-24 15:16:02
It seems to me that everyone has what they wanted. 
As an additional thought (stemming from recent posts) I see a wider issue opening up around historic poor UTXO management which segwit will not resolve.
Perhaps this had led to some of the resistance to segwit as a scaling solution rather than a base block increase. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 22:03:25
This is s great comment by Pieter Wuille on similar topic. A great read.
@_date: 2017-12-26 10:05:43
Reading this article gave me a different perspective on the stance some of the larger business (transaction creators) took on the scaling debate. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 22:26:05
Am I not understanding this correctly or could the flat line of the witness size percentage be an indication of this ?
@_date: 2017-12-25 17:58:47
This helps on understanding how block weight works: 
@_date: 2017-12-25 12:26:28
Because segwit does not solve the problem of past poor UTXO management. This is the real issue of why large blocks are continually being pushed and btc value is being attacked and why segwit is not being adopted. 
Once segwit is adopted then there is no reason at all for larger blocks and the UTXO set that is going to cost Coinbase double the current value of the respective Btc held will still need to be managed. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 20:41:09
I recommend a SMEG FAB280Q for cold storage. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 15:50:43
Time to consolidate those UTXOs. Let's see if Coinbase take advantage of this !
