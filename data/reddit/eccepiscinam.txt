I'm well aware but they do account for a significant portion of exchanges

big banks aren't a huge part of wall street?

How so? By being principled? If the main use of btc is just tax evasion I want nothing to do with it. If online stores actually accept it for payment then its a different story but that does not look like it will be the case for a while

ya I think this poster might be letting his emotions affect his judgement. This is starting to look more and more like a bubble

Man fuck that, I really like the idea of btc and a decentralized bank but if it just becomes a way for the megarich to offshore their wealth then I am going to have to get out

as long as the laundering wasn't the primary reason. right now btc is absolutely worthless as a currency since steam doesn't accept it anymore
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:15:39
what do you mean by that?
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:34:52
not really comparable at all. You can actually use USD as currency, that isn't really true for btc yet at all

uhhhh ya it kind of does, assuming there are more people like him out there buying. This is how bubbles are formed

most people weren't buying weed on the silk road though
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:40:38
it is absolutely not in the banks interest for btc to rise
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:37:23
your god has abandoned you
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:01:14
btc doesn't have much utility right now besides as a store of value. At this point it is relying on hype and the fact that wall street is buying so it can short

lol imagine being serious about this
