Make a list of every positive thing in your life &amp; then a list of your dream life. Imagine daily actually living that life. In detail. Find an affirmation that you believe and say it. You have unlimited potential and none of it has to do with bitcoin. Go in the direction of something that makes you happy...keep moving forward! Life is just one big experiment &amp; you are playing a role. You are an eternal life force in a flesh suit. Drink water, go in nature, find things that make you happy &amp; do them!!
