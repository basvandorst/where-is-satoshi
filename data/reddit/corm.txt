It's the best crypto whitepaper I've read too
@_date: 2018-01-10 06:11:56
True, but the more that do the easier it'll be, but you're right
@_date: 2018-01-07 01:08:29
This is a really cool thing you've built. Rock on
@_date: 2018-01-06 23:49:10
This is actually pretty interesting and the first time I've seen it talked about. I tried running a BTC node on my raspberry pi and the bottleneck I ran into was RAM. Now, I'm not convinced that it fundamentally needs &gt;1GB of RAM, but as it is today it'd a good point.
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:31:47
He's a great asset but if he got hit by a bus eth would be fine. There are a lot of people at the eth foundation working on features
@_date: 2018-01-10 00:50:20
Because we need segwit to be adopted fully before lightning will work afaik
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:58:46
Sounds well informed to me. Everything they said is true. Tron violated the GPL when they copied tons of ethereum code without attribution. How are they ill informed?
@_date: 2018-01-17 18:06:19
Hah yep! Unchained is pretty good :)
@_date: 2018-01-07 00:14:56
Ok I've started reading these but it seems like the main reason that BTC core (software) uses so much RAM is that it stores most (all?) of the UTXO in memory, instead of using a caching system (only UTXOs from this year for example). That could surely be improved
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:09:52
~~Done, I don't see anything about 2x 
I linked to the wrong one, you're totally right. Interesting: 
@_date: 2017-12-15 06:26:02
Check out my other reply. You can generate a merkle tree once every 2000 blocks of all the unspent TXs to solve it. Trust sucks
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:26:40
Can you just send you BTC to coinbase and flip it for cash there? Or do you mean they won't let you send your BTC?
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:14:58
This is a really good question. A list would really help new devs get into crypto. You might check out the repos here and see if there's any low hanging fruit in the issues lists: 
Noticing what sub I'm in I'll also google a little harder and find this 
@_date: 2017-12-15 17:33:00
Why is that important? All LN TXs are real bitcoin TXs that can theoretically be played back on the blockchain (but a bad acting LN node will lose everything, and all TXs will be reverted with the safety net TX). After settlement all the final TXs will literally be on the blockchain. 
Personally I doubt LN will help much, but I'm not sure what your beef against it is
@_date: 2017-12-14 23:17:47
What is this fee? And what inflation?
@_date: 2017-12-15 18:12:37
I'm honestly interested. Can you expand on this?
@_date: 2017-12-15 23:29:44
Hm, it's definitely wishy washy about when a LN node has to close out. That'll be one of the things I'll have to look into more. 
But I just found out that an LN node can route your TX through another LN node, which is pretty sweet. So theoretically you'd only be paying the LN fee once and you could use it at starbucks, winco, etc for the duration. 
What you're describing is more like how coinbase operates right now. You don't really have a true wallet until you send your coins out of coinbase, and you can pay other coinbase users for free (because it doesn't actually move any money around afaik)
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:22:18
The ledger is pretty convenient though. I use it for BTC, BCH and ETH right now and I can spend straight from it instantly from any computer (no need to reboot into USB) or even from my android via myetherwallet.com and mycellium. I don't think it's worth the pricepoint for everyone though.
@_date: 2017-12-11 05:58:51
LN is pretty different. I'm not sure it will actually save money for the average folks like me who do 1 TX a month on average, but unlike with a different currency LN doesn't expose you to risk. Nobody can run off with your money during an exchange like with FOREX. There's no trust, and you're still protected from double spends with BTC's huge mining network
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:30:11
Crypto doesn't work the same way and the same rules don't apply. Bitcoin isn't really "slow", it's just that the blocks are full. 0-conf transactions are instant and perfectly fine for coffeeshop transactions. Who's going to try to doublespend on their latte? Once enough nodes have heard about the TX it's fairly safe even before a block has been mined. 
For bigger TXs (1000+) just wait the 5-10 mins for a block. Easy peasy. 
The fees are the problem. And LN helps the fees by emptying out the blocks. The blocks will empty out because transacting on the LN will be so much cheaper that almost everyone will do it. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 06:24:18
I'd actually really like to code that up. My biggest excuse is that core is written in C and I really hate C for business logic. I want to try though. I [posted about it here]( although I obviously didn't follow through. 
It's good to talk about it though because it would be an enormous optimization that would allow way more people to run full pruned nodes, and maybe someone else will code it and save me the trouble.
Any ideas about why that wouldn't work though, or just a feeling?
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:37:05
That's a good idea. I'd argue that a hardware wallet is still slightly more secure since the attack surface is much smaller and offline (any software or hole that allows root access on tails will compromise your keys). 
I'd say both a USB with tails and a hardware wallet are EXTREMELY secure though. 
The hardware wallet is more convenient though. I can just toss it into a compromised machine and send TXs for days. And I just like the idea of an offline machine that only handles your keys
@_date: 2017-12-14 23:29:41
I'm really happy to see civil block-size-increase discussion. I think it's a great idea. 
We should also talk about pruning. Pruning gives us a 50-80x space savings with only 1 small downside.
Right now pruning works great, but I still have to download the whole chain. We could get a lot more people running full (pruned) nodes if we solved the problem with the rare overly-pruned chain attack. That's where you give someone a pruned chain but you've pruned out all the TX's where you sent money out. 
The easiest way to solve this is to allow for an option as a full node to host a merkle tree of all UTXO every 2000-ish blocks. Then pruned nodes could use that to validate their own chains. 
Boom, pruned chains with no downsides
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:23:10
Bigger blocks are a great short term (4 years maybe) solution imo. The biggest problem is that you still have to download the whole chain even if you're pruning it. 
This can be fixed by having nodes cache up "checkpoints" of the blockchain (I talk about it more [here]( but we're not there yet, we need to code it
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:27:48
Really? What did they need to do?
I'm sure the devs are busy but busy with "protecting against 2x"? That sounds unlikely 
Edit for readers, they's right: [link](
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:04:31
That's completely absurd. Why would you think that would be a problem?
What's your idea of something more secure? (unless you say "paper wallet that I never spend from", you're going to be wrong). 
I'm sorry if I sound harsh but you can't just go around spreading FUD about the most secure way to transact unless you have some good reasons to back it up.
Edit: Wait, you meant "from 3rd parties" as in "from walmart", not "from trezor". Miscommunication, sorry. I still disagree though. I don't know about the Trezor but my ledger s is tamper proof. And even if there's a very small risk, it's still far lower than running a wallet from your phone or PC
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:05:39
Cool, that's pretty dang secure if it never goes online. 
The HW wallet is much more convenient though for the same security. The USB would be a solid option for people that want to have a secure vault for long term storage without having to pay the $70 for the ledger though. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:41:54
Cool I'm all for speculation though, so let's pretend it's 10 years in the future and the network is big enough to not be centralized anymore. How does it work at that point?
Is the idea that everyone will basically have a small PoW miner? That's what I'm mostly confused about, because that seems very prone to blowing up the network with an ASIC
@_date: 2017-12-15 06:16:50
The main problem with just downloading a pruned chain is that there's no way to tell if a villain pruned out extra UTXOs. But one solution is to compare it with a bunch of other nodes that are holding pruned chains and ask them if they have the exact same UTXOs that you have at an agreed upon block number. 
That sounds insanely expensive but it's actually not. Several full nodes could hold a merkle tree of all the UTXOs at a certain point in time (say every 2000 blocks, holding only the most recent one) and then you could compare yours to that. Since it's a merkle tree you can quickly solve exactly which UTXOs the villain left out too. It would only be an extra ~10GB for certain full nodes that opted in, and it only takes 1 to fully secure the network from this attack.
@_date: 2017-12-21 05:09:30
NP hopefully you find something, I'm kind of searching for something myself
@_date: 2017-12-27 16:12:14
That's just hyperbolic. There's no reason bcash can't adopt layer 2 solutions as well when they're ready
@_date: 2017-12-15 02:06:18
Not many due to pruning. 
I can run a full pruned node for under 10GB right now. You still have to download a lot of data though (it prunes as it goes) but that will eventually be resolved. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:38:08
Yeah hopefully the price comes down. I'm sure it will now that crypto is getting so popular and everyone is going to need to secure their keys, so the high demand will drive more competitors into the space
@_date: 2017-12-15 21:46:20
Hm, but I thought they had to close out and settle. I thought it was set to 30 days or something like that. And unlike a bank, the LN can't run off with your BTC, because when you open a channel you get a magic TX that allows you to spend it and get all your money back after 30 days (I believe that's the timeframe). So there's no trust involved at all, unlike a bank. Worst case is you lose your money for 30 days.
I also thought LN had cross channel communication but a google search seems to indicate that I was confusing it with Ethereum's Sharding. 
I think LN could be useful for people shuffling around a lot of money, like maybe starbucks or ... hm. Well I'm sure there's use. I probably won't personally use it though since I rarely transact (like most people).
Also I'm not sure what you mean by this:


I don't think that's how LN works

Hm, that's definitely not how it works, at that point it wouldn't be a lightning network, they'd have to call it something else. I encourage you to read up on how it works: 
Honestly I need to brush up more on how it works too. You've raised my concerns enough that I'll be digging into it tonight
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:11:37
I mean yes, that's true for bitcoin now because it's insanely full, but I was saying that if the blocks were empty it wouldn't be an issue. You totally could RBF the TX back to yourself but you wouldn't at a coffeeshop or the owner would come over and hit you. 
Bitcoin can be quite fast when it's not congested. It's broken af right now though
@_date: 2017-12-01 00:39:19
Definitely this. It seems like the obvious choice
@_date: 2015-12-10 16:17:09
Sure is a lot of edge in here. Anyway everytime I go to buy my monthly train ticket for $100 my bank stops the transaction and calls me to make sure it was me. It takes them 5 minutes to call me. Every month I miss a train. I feel your pain OP.
@_date: 2017-12-09 22:45:10
I just read 8 pages of the whitepaper and dug through a bunch of reddit posts for the last hour (go me!). It's not looking good, check this out: 
It looks like it's going to be more susceptible to 51% attacks than most coins because a $1000 ASIC miner can create a transaction a bajillion times more weighty than a $10 IoT miner (not just 100x). 
The DAG thing is really interesting though even if it turns out to be impractical. I'm still reading. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:13:05
True, and you would think it'd work that way, but it can be hard to get adoption because in order to change the protocol you have to get miner buy in and developer support. Usually for nice proven things like segwit that isn't a problem. But then there's political things like Proof of Stake. It'll be very hard to convert bitcoin to that even once it's proven to be good, because no miner would want to make their mining rigs obsolete. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:22:39
But if another coin solves scaling better (so, low fees) then why would I bother having bitcoin? I'd just use the other coin as a store of value and a coffeeshop currency (as long as it wasn't inflationary)
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:28:00
Hah, that's a great story. You're awesome. 
I should mine a doge block..
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:28:59
I see a lot of IOTA talk around here and maybe you're a good person to ask. How's it going to work? Doesn't it work by having each person perform a proof of work? That seems super crazy to me since it would be trivial to make a super efficient miner like an ASIC and ruin the network with 51% attacks. 
I'm sure I'm waaay off but I'd love to hear why

I've worked in several buildings that were basically faraday cages. If I had to rely on my cell signal (or even the building's wifi) to order at the cafeteria then I'd never have eaten. 
One of many examples. 
The fact is that having money on hand and being guaranteed it will work is extremely important to most people. 
@_date: 2014-09-16 18:34:24
Well of course, the bitcoin scenario is no different from a normal transaction with cash or a check, the receiver has no way of knowing the legitimacy until they go to deposit the check/cash. 
I want to be able to give money without needing to by online. And as answered in the top post, this is totally possible, just not implemented in a mobile app yet. 
The usability advantage of this is huge. 
@_date: 2014-09-16 05:02:41
Oh fantastic! Are there any mobile apps that support this?

Wtf are you talking about?
@_date: 2017-08-24 17:40:27
That's entirely false. Watch the vid. That's wildly wrong. Literally everything you just said is wrong. 
tl;dr is that you use your on-chain money, and if any of the nodes act badly there's a smart contract that returns your money. Don't ask me anything about it till you've learned how it works though, because it's fairly complex
@_date: 2017-08-24 08:00:14
Even if someone makes a transaction from an address 10,000 blocks back and I have `prune=550`? 
@_date: 2017-08-24 16:00:13
Ok I don't know what 2x is but currently segwit should provide up to a 50% fee reduction within maybe a year or two. That's great. You're saying that's "nothing"? How about accept that all good things happen via small improvements. This also lays the groundwork for LN. Have you looked into what LN is? Have you watched any videos explaining how it works? If not watch this 50 min one 
It's pretty promising. 
@_date: 2017-08-24 17:47:11
That'd be abstracted behind whatever wallet service they're using. They'd never know they were using LN. Good on you for checking it out though. I'm very interested in all scaling solutions, but they are all highly complex. 
@_date: 2017-08-24 15:06:52
Cool site, seriously. But why did you link it? Are you trying to say "look how there's just as many unconfirmed txs as there were last week"? Which would imply that you thought that segwit would change things overnight, or be anything more than a small, good, improvement. But I'm presuming. Maybe I'm misunderstanding you
@_date: 2017-08-24 14:24:48
Awesome :) 
Any idea where I can download a pruned chain? I don't really know why I'd ever not want a pruned chain 
@_date: 2018-06-24 17:06:04
I like that all your solutions involve rectums
@_date: 2017-12-15 16:50:55
LN isn't a private ledger. There's no trust involved
@_date: 2018-06-24 17:04:59
Then it's a paper wallet
@_date: 2017-11-20 07:29:29
This doesn't even make sense. By that logic, any other POW coin would be crushed instantly by any 1 of the tons of mining pools. But they aren't. Why is BCH a thing? Why hasn't a pool crushed it yet with double spends?

Yes, this would be a valid concern if any of the top 20 market cap coins were only owned by 1 person and their alts... which, come on. 
The original thread was about the marketcap being false for bitcoin (based I assume on coinmarketcap.com), but that would only make sense if only 1 person owned the top 20 market cap coins.
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:30:23
Nah, that would only work if there was only 1 user of the coin. Exchanges are public so if you were doing that then Bob's arbitrage bot would start selling shitcoinX on your exchange too and make a killing.
And if you think all altcoins only have 1 user but have multibillion dollar market caps, well you're wrong
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:00:30
No the bot would buy shitcoinX on exchangeA and sell it seconds later at your exchange, and you lose out.
None of the top 20 coins are on just 1 exchange.
@_date: 2019-09-04 23:25:22
My understanding is that you can't recover any information about the private key from the output space because that information is lost due to the modulo operation. It doesn't matter how many samples you have of output data.
Instead of focusing on RSA, it might make more sense to focus on [one time pad]( encryption, since you're talking about recovering the private key from the output messages, not from the public key. That's basically the same as trying to recover a one-time-pad key given only the output data. One-time-pad encryption is [provably]( unbreakable (which I just learned).
@_date: 2019-09-05 14:58:48
Thanks for discussing this with me, I've learned a lot. And I don't know if I have enough time to explain what I learned very well but let me give it a shot.
Skim this page on exactly how public/private key encryption works, especially the encryption section, and spend some time to get a feel for what those variables are (`n` and `e`, modulo and exponent): 
When you share your public key with someone so that they can send you secret info, that public key is now exposed to attackers. The attacker now knows 2 things:
* The exponent that you're going to going to raise the secret message to (which is always prime), which is usually 65537 ([here's why](
* The modulo value, which is very large (roughly 1024 bits)
For example to encrypt `hi` you'd convert it to binary (`01101000 01101001`) and then to an integer (`26729`) (ignoring padding) and then raise that to the exponent (say `65537`), then modulo that by your huge modulo.
With those 2 things the attacker doesn't need to bother with snooping messages, because they can just encrypt as many as they want. But that doesn't give them anything. They already have the modulo and the exponent, but they have no way to use those for anything without factoring primes to figure out what your secret number is.
@_date: 2019-09-04 18:53:18
The enigma was cipher text, of course you can break that with ML easily. Cipher text isn't modern encryption. 
In your stackexchange link they only talk about guessing the key, which ML wouldn't help you with at all.
You can't partially break encrypted data. From your own link: 


ML provides no help at all with cracking data encrypted with public/private key encryption, if all you have is the encrypted data.
I didn't downvote you though, you're at least trying to be informed here, and doing some research.

100 separately encrypted messages wouldn't help at all, each one would be just as hard to crack as the next. I'm familiar with the universal approximation theorem and I've helped use that [to build a neat little bug simulation in python](
Please explain how you having 100, or 1,000, or 1,000,000 separately encrypted messages would help crack even 1 of them. 
Each one needs a key to open. The key is (at minimum) 256 bits long. If even 1 bit is wrong then the message is completely garbled to the point of appearing random. 
ML wouldn't help speed this process up at all. Ultimately you need to guess a key which is 256 bits long, which can't be done even with a galaxy of super computers and a billion years.

Alright fair enough, I certainly don't know what sound means in an economic context.
I think we can both agree that more adoption means less swings though. If everyone used btc it would be pretty dang stable
@_date: 2018-04-03 16:51:13
Aw :D you made me smile irl 
You're cool too &lt;3, thanks for the info on what sound means. And wow that's a comprehensive post about Roger. Seems like a shady guy. 
The only celebrities I follow in the crypto space are devs who've contributed a lot though, and that keeps me pretty safe from the BS ones like this Roger guy

That actually makes sense. So it's not really a big deal that in order to change the protocol you needs a ton of support. 
My issue I guess is that it seems like changes to the protocol are mostly in the hands of the client developers, and it would be sort of nice to give some voting power to the people holding a lot of coins. But maybe in the grand scheme that doesn't really matter and balances out through other means. 
@_date: 2017-05-29 18:44:12
Yep, and also that the bar would ban you or yell at you. 
I mean you can call your bank and cancel a debit transaction too but it's going to be a terrible idea

So let's say I want to send Bob 1mBTC. What would that look like? Would I need to have put money into my "lightning wallet" (run by a 3rd party) first? 
And could they steal my money theoretically? Purely technically and forgetting about the economics of doing bad business, could they steal my money? 
These are questions I've had rolling around my head for a long time. You seem knowledgeable. 
@_date: 2017-05-14 22:41:21
I'd like to know this too. It's a very hard problem. I wonder if proof of stake can solve this by dropping the cost of "mining" to almost nothing (meaning less need for fees). But that's assuming PoS is possible and that there aren't other solutions. 
edit: in thinking about it more, PoS wouldn't help at all

Why not use a memory heavy algorithm that favors gpus like etherium does?
@_date: 2017-07-10 05:36:51
Nope you're right 
@_date: 2017-05-31 08:30:10
Nice! Well that's great news that they physically can't steal my money. That was my biggest concern. 
Thanks a lot for taking the time to type this out, it's very helpful. 
@_date: 2018-04-03 13:56:06
Actually I read that as implying that money is more sound if more people are using it. As in, less susceptible to wild swings in value, which is true
@_date: 2017-05-14 22:21:36
They're over a dollar? *checks*... oh damn they are. That's broken as far as I'm concerned. 
It seems to me like the biggest flaw with cryptocurrency is that it's hard to run it. How can you incentivize for making positive changes to the protocol? 
@_date: 2017-05-14 23:29:05
I appreciate the reply but I'm not sure it really touches on my question. I've always sort of been confused about how a coin's protocol gets changed. 
I know that if the devs of the most popular client make a change and give enough warning to other clients about the change, then that change happens and anyone who doesn't update is on an old fork until they do. 
But what about 20 years down the line? Is it possible to engineer change into the protocol itself instead of through client popularity? Is that even a good idea? 
I sort of got the impression from your post that you think I'm shilling something but I'm just interested in the tech and the dream of global crypto currency usage

Tell me more of a zero fee coin. How would that work? Why would miners include transactions in blocks?
@_date: 2017-06-04 08:45:17
But then how would it protect against spam? If I tried to send a billion 1satoshi transactions between 2 wallets then what would stop that? 
How would you sort out real transactions from spam? I guess maybe going off some limit of transactions per IP address? It gets pretty murky... 
Also relying purely on good faith for miners to put transactions through seems a little risky since we already have problems with empty blocks. 
I want it to be possible but I'm awfully skeptical

@_date: 2017-06-04 19:42:07
.... HUH! Neat!
If that's the case then why does bitcoin have 1MB blocks?
And if I want to run a full node right now don't I need like 150GB just for the blockchain? 
@_date: 2017-06-04 09:27:04
Microtransactions matter because of space limitations. Blocks can only be so big so we can't just allow all transactions or else the blockchain would be a million petabytes 
@_date: 2017-06-05 17:54:36
Well that is truly neat. Thanks for the conversation, I learned a lot here. 
If you hear of a zero fee coin that has a client that supports pruning at some point let me know. 
I'm surprised this hasn't been talked about more. I don't think a lot of people know about pruning. Personally I'd read the whitepaper before but I thought pruning was only useful for lite-clients. I think a lot of people have that misconception. TIL!
@_date: 2017-06-03 18:08:24
Or litecoin or eth or hurry up with segwit.
I mean basically all altcoins have low fees so that's a pretty weak pro. I don't know of a coin that scales in a way where if it had the market demand/value of btc the fees would be any less than btc
