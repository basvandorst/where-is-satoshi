Did you just send the coins to your online wallet or did you do that 9 months ago?
@_date: 2014-10-17 01:42:42
Use this calculator to see just how much money you are wasting in electricity.  Buy an ASIC or just buy coin.  Both are gambles (with mining being even more risky).

Does the existence of cash encourage illegal behavior?  Freedom to transact beyond the controls of the state gives power to individuals.  You have to take the tremendous good that results from decentralization with the small amounts of bad.
@_date: 2014-12-22 13:55:06
That's not a significant amount of coin.  Just hodl the BTC and buy company stock with any additional money you can afford to.
@_date: 2014-12-22 12:42:36
What year is it?!?!?!  If you want cryptocurrency, buy it.
@_date: 2014-09-13 15:00:33
If you trust HTTPS and SSL to send private information online, you should also trust Bitcoin.  Its based on similar encryption and its source code has been publicly scrutinized since its inception.  If quantum computers become mainstream, the Internet has much bigger issues to deal with.

Trust **no one** who has a *legit projection* of its future value.
@_date: 2014-10-11 23:34:41
That's a bad generalization and you should feel bad.  Bitcoin can be as anonymous as you want it to be.
@_date: 2014-10-23 22:58:09
be verrrry cautious of scammers.
@_date: 2014-09-26 01:37:12
Just make sure the cash is not counterfeit and the customer has the correct amount before sending the coin.  Prepare to get skeptical looks from people (who will think you are making an illicit transaction).  Also, you may meet really interesting people who are just as interested in virtual currencies as you are.  Talk to them while the transaction confirms and make a new friend!
@_date: 2014-09-13 15:08:01
I think you mean confirmations?  This is basically how "deep" the transaction is in the blockchain (in blocks).  Most clients do not show a transaction as confirmed until it has 6 confirmations.  At this point, you can be 99.9% it was not a double-spend.
@_date: 2014-09-13 14:12:57
Coinbase is indeed a complete pain at first, but once you get your bank account confirmed and supply a credit card, you can literally buy instantly.  The bitcoin are in your wallet and spendable before they even debit from your account the next day.  Good luck and welcome to bitcoin!
@_date: 2014-10-12 23:56:08
This uses some centralized, pre-mined currency with no plan of tapering the supply.  No thanks.
@_date: 2014-10-17 01:48:36
Dude.  Stop now.  I really hope you are just trolling.  Everyone thinks they can call the market and come out on top.  That's not at all how it works.  Bitcoin "investing" is just gambling and the odds are not in your favor.
@_date: 2014-12-13 11:35:35
 is a good place to start.  Its electronic money that can be transferred over the Internet between parties without trusting an intermediary.
@_date: 2014-09-26 01:32:31
Seems legit.  lol
@_date: 2014-12-13 12:01:33
By "this electronic money" are you referring to conventional government-printed currency that is represented digitally by various banks and other companies?  Bitcoin has no central authority that creates it and has an upper-limit to how many will ever be produced.  There is also a global transaction ledger. Whereas conventional currencies can be produced without limit and ledgers are privately maintained by the institutions that hold them.
@_date: 2014-09-13 14:31:32
**These next few weeks are going to be critical.**  Sorry, its a running joke anytime Bitcoin pops up in the media.
@_date: 2014-12-22 12:48:23
There are too many miners for this level of price collusion.  Also, mining is still relatively rewarding for those with a significant amount of capital invested.  Miners who need to convert BTC to pay their electric bill are doing so.  Miners who have enough USD set aside to pay their short-term expenses, can (and are) speculating by holding.
@_date: 2014-11-15 11:43:46
That was worth reading.  Thanks for sharing!  I don't get over to bitcointalk as much as I used to.  Its good to see there is intelligent discussion happening.
@_date: 2014-11-22 11:42:49
Hahaha thanks!
@_date: 2014-10-23 21:45:45
Bitcoin can be used for all kinds of things.  Remittances are just one part of the value BTC provides.  IMHO I think Bitcoin is being used for speculating, hedging against fiat inflation, money laundering, tax evasion, when buyers don't want their credit card number stored, and when sellers don't want a risk of charge-backs.
@_date: 2014-10-12 01:42:42
Good work, sir!
@_date: 2014-10-27 21:25:26
Sorry, Bitcoin doesn't fit the status quo.  Please ask your dear leaders for permission to use it.
@_date: 2014-10-17 00:00:28
Banks see anything BTC related as risky and just don't want to deal with it.  Did you initiate the "deposit only" stipulations on your account or did that bank do that?
@_date: 2014-10-11 23:32:36
Fees that Circle already collects.  The increased user base (and resulting revenue) would hopefully justify paying the employees and for the brick and mortar locations.
@_date: 2014-10-17 00:04:33
Oh really?  They will need to shut down the Internet to keep me from broadcasting transactions.
@_date: 2014-10-16 23:54:01
Unfortunately, you can't expect Bitcoin's price to be stable at this point.  Volatility is decreasing over time, but it is by no means a dependable store of value.  If you are just planning on buying something denominated in fiat (Euros in your case), you should buy about 5% more than expected and make the purchase immediately.
@_date: 2014-10-27 21:44:32
Except Bitcoin is a **form of payment** and OP was just asking if they accepted it.  Vinyl siding is unrelated (and a poor way of transacting because it changes when subjected to elements and time, its not very portable, and its not fungible).
@_date: 2014-10-27 21:27:03
Get a job, you lazy bum.  Oh, and stay off my lawn.
@_date: 2014-10-23 22:53:20
I really like this idea.  Smart people will completely understand the transition and reasoning behind it.  Dumb people will think the price crashed to $0.36 and became affordable.  The normal response is that this is no issue and people can pick any unit they want on their client.  But we need to understand this is a big psychological barrier for humans and would spur usage.
@_date: 2014-11-21 00:21:29
1. Post to that you have a small amount of BTC
2. Receive tips
3. Profit
@_date: 2014-09-26 01:42:44
Then you are fine.  If the Bitcoin-QT wallet is now empty, you can safely uninstall it and delete the blockchain and wallet data from your computer.  Be sure to backup your online wallet and add 2 factor authentication (just to be on the safe side).
@_date: 2014-10-23 19:19:49
No, there is no way to regulate cryptocurrencies.  You can regulate and surveil and on-ramps and off-ramps from fiat, but stopping transactions from being included in blocks would basically require shutting down the Internet.
@_date: 2014-09-26 01:58:49
Keep in mind that Dogecoin would not exist if Bitcoin did not pave the way.  You should feel honored that your currency is based in Satoshis.  Also, lets be friends.
@_date: 2014-11-22 12:29:06
0.01 is tree fiddy.  Even the Loc Nest monster can afford that.  :-)

Oooo!  Friend rates!  I do need some vinyl siding.  Do you accept Bitcoin?

Sidebar: "Begging/asking for bitcoins is absolutely not allowed, no matter how badly you need the bitcoins."
@_date: 2014-09-06 23:43:44
Don't be sad.  Look at the number of transactions per day, bro.  Its nearly the highest its ever been.  People are actually using this stuff.  I agree its less boring when the price is going moonward, but stability is what many have been wanting.
@_date: 2014-12-13 12:03:42
Not quite, but you still have reason to be excited!  1 Bitcoin = 1 million "bits."  This nice person sent you 100 bits.
@_date: 2014-11-01 22:11:08
The suspense is killing me!  You need to write a full script!
@_date: 2014-10-24 00:22:58
Bitcoins cannot be deleted.  You need to step up your trolling.
@_date: 2014-10-16 20:04:11
With that system, you are not actually doing it.  You are asking others (banking and government) to transmit value on your behalf.  **Actually** sending fiat money would require well-trained pigeons that could fly across oceans.
@_date: 2014-10-12 17:55:18
I understood that reference.  For those who don't:
@_date: 2014-09-13 14:56:40
This goes against what Bitcoin was founded on.  It is a **decentralized** form of money that exists as an Internet protocol.  This is like asking for the Bittorrent support line when a tracker-less torrent fails to download.  Charge-backs are completely absent to guarantee merchants the transaction went through (after about 6 confirmations).  If you are being charged more for a service than anticipated, you should not be doing business with that party.  I assume you deposited to SD, then they reduced your balance on the site more than their terms stated?  The very nature of Bitcoin enables the **sending** party to send only what they specify to a receiving address.  So its actually impossible to be charged more than what the sender intends.  Bitcoin needs to be treated exactly like cash (you should not hand cash to people who do not have a reputation of providing the goods/services they promise).
@_date: 2014-12-13 13:26:59
Yep.  Checkout Armory.  Its fairly simple to setup and allows you to keep your coins on an offline computer.  You can still spend them and check your balance using an online computer.  You then use the offline device to validate transactions.  I recommend ~~Ubuntu~~ Lubuntu as the OS for the offline computer.
@_date: 2014-10-12 18:54:00
50x the price?  lol  You actually paid $7 for your coins?  How did it feel missing out on making millions?
@_date: 2014-10-23 21:23:05
Circle and CampBX have never done me wrong.  Bitfinex seems well-liked so far, but I have no personal experience.
@_date: 2014-10-17 01:37:22
wow very btc history
such story
much thanks 4 sharing
@_date: 2014-10-23 21:17:08
I really like the idea.  But when it comes to reality, I'd stick with just leaving instructions in your will on how to access your cold storage or paper wallet.  Obviously give your living heir some training on actual usage, so their first time using Bitcoin isn't moving your life savings around.
@_date: 2014-09-26 01:49:16
wow such loaded question very unshibelike
@_date: 2014-09-13 14:20:00
This is definitely not the place to get a worthwhile answer to this question, as many here are heavily invested in bitcoin's future.  You will get a very bias view.  Golden rule: invest only what you can afford to lose. 
@_date: 2014-10-23 22:04:10
The price is going down because supply &gt; demand.  We can discourage selling by creating a real economy entirely within the BTC ecosystem.  ie. You are paid in BTC --&gt; You spend BTC on all goods and services you want or need --&gt; Merchants pay their suppliers in BTC ---&gt; BTC never touches fiat.  This would add real (non-speculative) value to BTC and won't happen overnight.
@_date: 2015-01-03 23:57:21
Get into Bitcoin for the right reasons, not as a get-rich-quick dream.  If you do buy BTC, spend only what you can afford to lose.  If losing £200 is going to be rough, convert less fiat (or don't invest at all).  Also, consider only buying a few £ your first time, so you can be sure you understand how to move and properly store your coin.
@_date: 2015-01-04 00:07:12
I'm right there with ya, buddy.  I've parted with a good amount of coin when the price was lower and wish I would have held out.  However, the stress associated with holding such a volatile investment is not missed at all.  Fiat is just a term to describe £, $, ¥, or any other printed currency that has no tangible good backing it.

Private Internet Access, a VPN company that accepts Bitcoin (among other payment methods).
@_date: 2014-10-28 00:18:37
I bought a VPN without providing a credit/debit card.
@_date: 2014-12-12 01:36:29
Check Google News!  Its like 3rd on the "technology" page.
@_date: 2014-10-12 01:28:41
Absolutely.  They could offer in-person services as a one-time deal for customers just getting their feet wet who want to purchase a large amount.  Employees are cheap.  Hell, I'd do it for $10-15 an hour.  A mall kiosk can't be *that* much overhead.  Just random thoughts.  I'd like to see older, non-techie folks comfortable using digital currency.
Edit:  I wasn't considering liability.  If an employee helped a customer install a client on their malware-infested device and their coins disappeared, the new Bitcoiner would be shrieking.  A physical help desk would turn into tech support with far greater consequences.
