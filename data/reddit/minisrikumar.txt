You can buy tether on some of the major exchanges like HitBTC, Bitfinex, Bittrex.
You can also convert your tether into USD via withdrawing to your bank account from those exchanges.

Are you calculating the cost of electricity correctly?
Also how does it compare to the average computer CPUs?
@_date: 2018-01-22 03:14:16
Yea that exchange is unknown lol
Decentralized exchanges or bust.

A signed message in crypto validates your identity more than that invasive KYC scam ever will. Many people have fake IDs anyways. Can't fake a signed message.   
If any crypto exchange/wallet/etc ask for KYC, BOYCOTT. Decentralized exchanges = rational

I think it depends on how the process would be if someone buys via crypto vs fiat?

yea send me the $1k tether from the giveaway and I will withdraw it from my exchange to my bank. Then I can go to my bank and withdraw the $1k into physical cash. 
It seems you removed your post tho so I am guessing you are not trying to honor your word...
If you do tho

yea anyone can do a 1sat/b tx on both BCH &amp; BTC and objectively see the truth. The bigger the block, the more transactions can fit. thus BCH will be cheaper 
@_date: 2018-09-13 18:13:04
all is clear for anyone to view if they value truth

Hodlers Only Die LOL 
Bulls make money, bears make money, you piggies get slaughtered 
HODL is a dump concept and I seen it mentioned before that shitty irrelevant 2013 forum post.

He realized he was invested in his friend Warren Buffet fund who is invested in multiple central banks. Basically money &gt; truth.

Congrats, I would say debt free is what bitcoin is also trying to do :) 
END THE FED
BTC will hit $10k on new years

Don't blame coinbase, blame the users who use them 
decentralized exchange
=

Whats the best decentralized exchange? I am tired of these sheep companies. BTC has no chargeback. there is no reason to freeze accounts. I can only see issue when someone buys btc with credit cards as CC can be charged back so there may be reason to lock account if the credit card was fraud

yea I went ahead and got the nano S. I paid extra for fast shipping. I hope I get it before the fork :) 
Thanks for the help

The only safe way I know of is accepting cold hard cash through the great

This may seem like a silly question, but, how does this compare to Monero? 
@_date: 2017-11-28 11:39:08
I knew it would happen before the new year began, surprised lots of people didnt think so
Now for the real challenge, When will bitcoin hit $100k? 
@_date: 2017-11-02 02:11:17
I found one on Amazon 
@_date: 2017-11-06 22:59:45
oh damn, didnt know about the bugs, might just get a ledger nano S since its more simpler and thus should have fewer bugs. Thanks for letting me know :) 
@_date: 2017-11-10 01:04:17
so sorry to hear your account got locked. My tip would be to make a video recording the whole thing. As people resonate with live video proof over screenshots. I had a similar experience with coinbase where they asked me to verify. CRYTPO key feature is anon and these sheep companies are going against that. We need decentralization NOW
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:03:13
Be careful, people on paypal can chargeback(aka get their money back)
Once you send the great BTC, its a done deal 
Many people on different forums would love to take BTC for their paypal. Hell, I would take BTC for my paypal lol 
@_date: 2017-11-06 20:50:23


where and when did you get a ledger blue? I been wanting one

Does Skrill work in the USA?

Will this be open or closed source?

Coinbase was decent in the beginning but after the IRS pressed them they started requesting photo ID to be stored on their server. Also banned in a few states. 
END THE FED 
All this BS is holding back btc
@_date: 2018-03-04 13:44:18
never sell your bitcoin for the paypal scam. The paypal scam allows chargeback so you will lose
@_date: 2018-04-26 08:33:44
uh can you show the spesific address? not sure how to figure any BTC moved today via that site
