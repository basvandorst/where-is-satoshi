I have come across the 'taxes adoption debate' before.
So if mass adoption is far off... then it has limited use now and for the short term future. So no real need to get anyone on board that doesn't want or can't learn and navigate it for themselves? Is this what you are getting at? It will take nation states accepting it to mass adopt? Is this a common thought among the crypto community? Genuinely curious. Trying to learn as much as I can. 
@_date: 2018-10-15 18:18:17
I agree! Node operators, users, etc... does not = owner.
This is a rabbit hole I think...
But work with me here...
Joe sixpack, the baby boomers, my aunt who isn't interested in computing science, cryptography etc... are all used to a centralized system of fiat. They TRUST it. They might not understand it, but they trust that a Gvnt backed dollar/unit of currency will still be a dollar tomorrow and that all the ppl they want to do business with will accept it as a unit of payment. Right or wrong, this is how the fiat system works in most developed nations. (not implying it is sustainable, or good/bad. It just IS the current system) 
So when teaching a NEW system to people, it is \*massively\* confusing, not to mention fosters even more confusion and mistrust, when they go to [Bitcoin.com]( and then ask whether to buy Bitcoin Cash or Bitcoin Core. 
\---&gt; Shouldn't those spaces be user defined, curated, and managed just like Wikipedia or the Bitcoin network it's self? 
I do see a problem is using OLD frameworks to explain new ones... but they ARE helpful. Or at least they're helpful in explaining to 'Mainstreet middle age Joe' what the Blockchain and Bitcoin are. 
\---&gt; Having Roger Ver and Bcash hold these icons of information is clearly a disservice to the whole project of Satoshi.... no?

But a LOT of people think national debts are "real". They're not. Google Debt Jubilees. Fiat is created easily and the debt is just as easily manipulated.
This is uncomfortable for a LOT of crypto nerds to understand. But it's the reality.
The feds can all just knock off zeros or half it all. At any time.
Nation states won't just roll over.
Crypto is really cool. But it's, deflationary, by design, which won't lend its self to used as a payment method.

Thanks for posting this man! You've done a solid job of explaining negative rates. Realllllly crazy concept to try and wrap your head around.... but fairly straight forward. Negative rates sound realllllly unsustainable though in the long term.... HOWEVER.... we've basically arrived at the TRUE function of fiat cash money: It MUST slightly inflate slowly BUT hold its value in the short term. If it was deflationary, people would hoard it and NOT spend it. If it inflates too quickly, people also couldn't use it to value goods and services. The hoarding of cash in shakey economies compounds the problem of a slow economy. Negative rates help encourage spending, investment and growth.
Do you have any examples of Nat banks that currently have negative rates already???

I think Schiff is slightly misguided. Slightly antiquated. But take a step back and remember the bigger picture: Schiff's ideas are more largely representative of the demographic of financiers his age that are of the cynical side of the fence regarding the financial status quo... BUT who also are too old school to embrace much change to the established order. Uber is even too much of a change for some of these guys.
Essentially... he represents a large controlling force of the markets who invest in stocks in good times, fixed income securities, bonds and commodities in uncertain times... and is critical of The Fed. 
Edit: He makes a lot of good points regarding larger market trends: household debt, unemployment etc...

Believe what ever you like. Erryone is entitled to their opinion. My facts are backed by examples of working economies, based on my assertions, are too many to list.
Not sure of any other economic policy that has worked for any economy anywhere where the currency isn't slightly inflationary paored with a soild GDP.
You're all free to provide ant examples of any economic policy counter to my assertion.

Yes. You make a good point here. 
The VAST majority of the population does NOT give a sheet about all the intellectual pontificating and antinestablishment that comes with Bitcoin. Average Joe just doesn't care. 
Average Joe cares that he can easily USE his money to buy a coffee, or dance classes for his daughter, or a trip to Hawaii. Average Joe UNDERSTANDs fiat currency for the most part, and average Joe knows fiat is stable. He is OK to incurr some fees here and there for services to send it around digitally too. He says "Hey, no big deal. The bank looks after my money... o I dont mind a small fee here and there."
Average Joe does NOT find any of the above in Crypto yet. The 'UX' is absolutely horrendous.
BUT... remember infrastructure of new technologies is slow sometimes to develop. Just because this is where it is now doesn't mean it always will be.

It's deflationary nature makes it a SOV or a quasi-commodity/security. *Not* really a currency to buy pizza with. 
More like a stock or gold or oil etc.
@_date: 2019-01-03 04:07:53
Sigh. There's truth to this opinion. 
Not everyone is a radical, inventive, thinker open to new ideas. Most people WANT to use fiat and actually like centralized institutions like banks and government backed things.
People jump on these fourms with unbounding and scathing opinions of the established status quo... and rail on about overthrowing nation states etc... but fail to see any benefits of a controlled currency supply. Or even understand how a *deflationary* asset has never been a useful or lasting currency. 
People in countries where inflation is unchecked or monetary policy is corrupt might be inclined to participate. But like you said... as of now the barriers and challenges of getting 'mainstreet' average Joe's and Jane's to use crypto are WAY too convoluted, risky and tech-y.
It's a massive jump to get people to trust a new technology where there is no single point of authority.

Good point. Except we are not directly using it or understanding it. As in... I have no idea how to use Linux or really what is it. (Open source operating program??) 
To use Crypto or even wrap your head around it properly takes hours and hours of study. And even still, price fluxuations, thefts of private keys, and limited adoption illustrate its drawbacks.
But to your point... blockchain tech DOES make a lot of sense for some specific database record keeping: insurance, property registeries...

@_date: 2019-01-03 08:13:20
I'm blown away by your detailed response. Thank you for taking the time to explain!!
I'll do the heavy intellectual lifting later by researching a few topics you've covered that are still unclear to me. But I understand the basics of why blockchain is NOT a desirable or functional solution to real estate now. 
---&gt; Essentially you're saying we still need a centralized point of record keeping as its not in everyone's interest (miners?) to keep updating the ledger. (But in theory wouldn't EVERYONE or at least all property owners want to keep an accurate ledger of all owned properties? In theory? Would they pool resources to have their interests acted upon in the form of paid mining on their behalf in this scenario?)
An interesting concept... that self-interest is what actually secures the network. I don't understand the cryptography at a high enough level to understand how transactions can't be forged... or how powerful miners (other than a 51% attack) can't just broadcast an incorrect ledger to be accepted (there's a majority voting system right?! In an instance of discrepancy)... but it seems to be a system that works thus far. 
Fair to say the number of miners (or nodes??) Is what determines the strength/security of a network?
Your oracle explaination is another fascinating concept. Right. What actually links the token to the physical item. Nothing. It's no better than an ownership paper.
And it is also interesting to see how blockchain could be a system of time stamping and validating a contract.
I'll have to go study mining again to understand just how blocks are formed and stamped/verified as accurate.
So much to continually learn... 
Thanks again for detailed analysis!
@_date: 2019-01-04 02:37:41
'Value' and 'currency' are not the same thing. 
An investment can not be a functioning currency and same vice versa.


People won't use Bitcoin as currency then. Period. Just like every deflationary asset in the past. Just like how no one is using it as currency now. 
Satoshi created something fixed and deflationary. It won't work as currency. In good/proper economic control a slightly inflationary currency keeps the economy moving and people spending. Centralized control of the money supply done right has been successful. Don't discount that. Some countries have messed this up due mostly to corruption but the countries that have gotten their currency control down properly see a functioning currency.
Bitcoin isn't money and won't ever be. At best it is a store of value or an investment. But not currency.
@_date: 2019-05-20 17:01:57

@_date: 2019-05-04 22:27:55
True. Cryptocurrency is not a tangible commodity. It's a string of computer code. Nothing more. Nothing less.
@_date: 2019-05-04 22:23:52
Yes. You make a very valid and undervalued point. Most crypto propenents have drunk the Kool Aid, hook line and sinker... and don't see the negative aspects to it. And they can't see or acknowledge the *good* aspects to things like Fiat Currency, Inflation, National Banks, Visa and Credit Card companies.
I'm a HODLer and Crypto proponent. But there are a lot of flaws, redundancies and problems with Crypto.
Something happens to my finances - fraud, theft, etc... I go into my bank and talk to Anthony, who I know. He knows I'm legit. He knows my job, where I live etc. He can help. Banks are insured.
The autonomy of crypto isn't always a good thing. How many ppl have been robbed by shady exchanges. The answer SHOULDNT be "Oh, every man for himself, you should have had a Trezor/cold storage". It's condescending and just plain a BAD system to foster adoption. 
Crypto is hella confusing. It's inconvenient. It's a system built on a trustless system. 
The computing science that underpins it is elegant. But the infrastructure is horrid.
@_date: 2018-12-23 18:50:25
Agree wholly. BTC fails as a currency because it is deflationary.
Maybe it will end up as a quasi security.

Wow. If you calm down one second and actually READ what I wrote... you will see that you did NOT address ANY of my assertions, but just made your own loaded, and wrong ASSUMPTIONS.
-You realllllly think Crypto users only fall into "2 categories"? I mean do I even need to address such a plainly sad assumption?
-Fees. I said the FEES of the EXCHANGE bringing fiat INTO BTC or crypto. The are outright scoundrels in some instances due to limited competition and trust. Charging 10, 15% just to take fiat into Digital. This is my main point. The OP was advocating Fiat to crypto to fiat to crypto. How illogical this was was almost stunning.
-I've read the white paper a many times and understand Satoshi's mandate far better than yourself... esp if you can not discern how  is used as a medium of exchange for goods and services EVEN if that happens to be an investment of any sort, the demonination in question included. It's entirely redundant to suggest that the 'worth' of a currency hinges ONLY on actual usage (it's merely one aspect of a functioning currency)
@_date: 2018-12-19 17:09:35
Disagree. Although I'm not even sure those were cogent thoughts.
Think about it logically....
If no one spent Fiat... and just HODLed it under their mattresses.... whatbwould happen to the price? And what would happen to it's utility as a "currency".
Has nothing to do with "interested" parties. 
Had to do with the fact that the supply CANT be controlled. All fanboys act like that is a GOOD thing. Well in some cases Yes... but in the case of using it as an actual Currency - nope.
@_date: 2019-05-04 22:14:38
I *dethink* so
@_date: 2018-12-24 22:29:21
2 problems: 
1) The fact that the supply of Bitcoin is deflationary (becomes more scarce)... basically encourages people NOT to spend it as cash or a vehicle to transact goods and services. (They just buy and HODL for the future profits...)
2) The government in any functioning democracy is really just a mirror of the majority. As social sentiment changes... so does the political landscape.
I don't know much about differring financial policy of corrupt nations... but not sure nation states of the world will just roll over and die. My best hunch is that they will incorporate crypto and take advantage of any means of financial gain.
Satoshi wrote a program to make the resource defined, calcuable and deflationary. This leads to potential problems for BTC to be used as cash.

1) Investment. A means of making fiat money via buying @ 4800, 5900, 7800, 9900, 14000 and selling for profits along the way. Its a hybrid digital security/commodity. And is unregulated. Which leads me to ...
2) It is disruptive to the status quo of finance. A new method of technology. It's my 'hedge' as an early adopter. In the case Crypto becomes larger and readily used... I have experience using it. And as a commodity/security there would be fiat gains. Parlay this with the millenial generation doing everything via decentralized methods (uber, air bnb, skip the dishes etc...) and it has a small chance of holding a place in finance.
3) The computing science and cryptography is just an interesting thing to study and participate in. I'm a geek. Lol. It's just cool.
4) Potential of real currency revolution is small... but present. In this case... I am building a position early.
--- I'm a realist though. And understand power dynamics and how those in power... or even the democratic institution... are unwilling/slow to adopt new forms of social organization.
Yes... BTC is cool. But national governments exist by means of Fiat taxation. Until you can pay taxes in crypto, Fiat will reign because eventually you still have to convert Crypto back to Fiat to pay the government.
I don't think governmental control of money supply is inherently a bad thing. I'm not a libertarian and DO believe in democratic decision making for infrastructure of the greater good. I'm a 'centrist' on the political spectrum... liberal about some things and conservative about others. But I am NOT a proponent of outright deregulation. I think people need to be protected from themselves in many cases. (Greed and individualism doesn't always = a greater benefit to the larger whole).

@_date: 2018-12-14 19:28:18
I appreciate your detailed reply. I understand basics of inflation and deflation.... which you outlined. And yes, people HODLing fiat is essentially what causes/encourages/helps recessions. No one spends and the economy grinds to a halt. Your analogy was that if currency deflates, it was caused by people not spending it (under a mattress)... and this is inherently negative. Are there any examples of this historically? When the last BTC is mined this is the scenario that will happen likely. 
I found your cake analogy a but clunky though... I kind of get what you're saying... I'm not advocating that 'Currency' itself is an 'investment' in the ridgid definition.... but the two aren't as dissimilar as toaster and frying pan. Apples and Oranges but both are still fruit growing on trees.
@_date: 2018-12-21 15:09:35
Lol. Here is where you're wrong bud. Bitcoin does not pass the test of a Currency not because people HODLing... that's just a symptom of Satoshi writing a fixed supply. It's deflationary by nature. (Look up definition if you need to). This... means the Bitcoins, by nature, will see demand far surpass the limited supply. And since there's no governing body to regulate the supply... people will HODL. Do you follow? It literally will not work as a currency.
Imagine if we treated cash/fiat the same way we do BTC. You can't, because fiat is controlled supply and usually slightly inflationary in modern times. This means if people HODL they will lose value slightly. Soooo they spend or invest it to BUY things or value. Bitcoin is opposite.
Bitcoin supply is regulated by code to be scarce. It will never work as a currency because of this. It's not working now.
Is it a commodity then? A payment system? Store of value? 
Here are some Facts:
-Open decentralized etc... ledger, yes. Currency? Nope.
-A 'valuable' asset? Lol. It's a string of computer code.
-Underlying utility and tangibility is zero. I can literally do nothing with my Bitcoin 'code' excpet transfer it to someone else. Smart contracts may be different in this manner.
Maybe it will last as a global payment transfer system to circumvent Western Union fees etc?
Satirical explaination of Bitcoin... 
"Imagine if we combined a public Excel spredsheet... a really hard Sodoku and a whole bunch of digital pirates and scoundrels. Welcome to cryptocurrency."
@_date: 2018-12-19 08:50:12
Um. This sounds redundant. But Bitcoin is NOT functioning as a Currency right now. Which is why people are NOT using it.
Too tired to elaborate this point.
Don't blame the people.
Time will tell whether a deflationary resource/asset (actually it's just a line of code in a glorified open excel sheet) can be actually used as a Currency.
Edit: I know it's more than a glorified Excel sheet. So before you start shouting "Its a decentralized payment peer to peer blah blah..." I'm being slightly sarcastic. Although there is truth to it. Thousands of dollars to own non-goverment backed digital lines of code.
@_date: 2018-12-19 08:30:35
Not sure you understand the concept of 'revolutionary'. The jury is still out on what Bitocoin even is. (Because it's NOT working as dependable Currency ATM and there's major doubt if it even could. [Because it's deflationary by nature which = hodling and NOT spending] I digress) Is it currency? Is it a commodity? Is it an investment?
Maybe. Maybe it's also none and in a handful of years all the miners will turn off their machines and we will be using a different system.
Revolution implies a complete overhaul.
The deck simply is stacked against this happening for MANY cogent reasons.

Cuz if a scam said "Wire fiat money to _____________ bank account", there is SOME type of traceability (at least is most countries). With crypto there isn't. It's a concern.

I admire his enthusiasm - not just for BTC... but for Capital Projects. He's similar to Trump (not a fan of him... but he DOES display this one quality) and other optimistically 'go getter'/proactive entrepreneurs in that he just "does". No hesitation. Just pushes all the chips in the middle of the table and says "Lets Do it!" Win or lose, he is already onto the next initiative. 
There are points to criticize his strategies but I admire that he's a "builder" so to speak. Trump is similar (to a fault though). 
Hopefully Starbucks et al DO pick up one of these payment methods and Draper is a pivotal piece of pushing adoption forward.
Edit: The Trump reference is just an offhand example of bold entrepreneuralism. Not a fan of his politics or personal dealings. Just a quick example of a business person who sees past the minutia and can be decisive. Insert Marc Cuban, Elon Musk, Steve Jobs etc.

Whelp. You also made A LOT of assumptions with labels. 
I'm not wholly Keynesian nor a 'classical liberal'. Why you frame me as such I think says more about you and placing people in boxes and diametrically opposed categories instead of just tackling the subject matter at hand.
If you want to know why I own crypto then ask. But assuming *anything* about me or my beliefs makes you look like a clown.
What was my assertion? Oh... that Bitcoin doesn't hve the properties to make it a useful Currency. People won't use it as a liquid form of transferring value if it is by nature deflationary! They will HODL and hoard it.
Bitcoin can only be an investment OR a currency. Not both. It's like asking an oven to also be a fridge. They're massive different financial instruments.
As for you last delusion about cartels and banks and 'real money'... it's a cute story but I recommend a quick look into power dynamics or either a micro or marco level.

Wow. Thanks for the detailed response. I had no idea currency rapidly inflated and deflated like that centuries ago?! Obviously with modernity (Esp in our life time...) we havent really seen any appreciable deflation. Our currencies (North america where I'm from) has only ever really inflated.
Last question for you would be: if Bitcoin, by nature of creation/supply being surpassed by demand, remains deflationary... then why wouldn't it be considered an investment in its self? Not sure I'm articulating my question properly. In simpler terms... is this why a slightly INflationary currecy is a 'good' thing? Then people are less inclined to hodl, which = a loss over a long enough time span?
I feel like I just figured out a huge epiphany to what makes a currency work hahaha. It NEEDS to be slightly inflationary.
In these terms... then Bitcoin is pretty terrible Currency... but an interesting investment or store of value. Except it's just a computer code (i know... open ledger etc...) but as a commodity its just a decentealized data base. Whereas gold and other historical commodities were tokens of use.
This is why people hype Ethereum... its advantage of contracts is a commodity in itself where BTC is more rudimentary.

True. But my stock portfolio does. Not sure how I see the relevancy of that though...
Whether you are an active investor or not... you are speaking about a market where the underlying asset's value flutuates globally with nearly unprecedented volitility. And *you came on reddit to talk about it. 
It's like talking about 'normal' gasoline prices. There are a tonne of factors determining oil gasoline prices.
Soooo.... the wild BTC price swings *are normal for Bitcoin. If you did your homework you would know this. Multiple price drops of 70,80% are common. The overall graph of its price can be understood with fractals. Not my fault if you don't know this just bought Crypto, and want to talk about it on Reddit.
TL:DR ... If you bothered to research or educate yourself about Cryptocurrency at all, you would see how Bitcoins' price level IS normal.

Sounds like we all applaud where you're coming from on this one... but a few stark challenges and realities remain:
-Governments operate via Fiat. It's their baby, brainchaild and medium of exchange. We ALL must pay our taxes to the government via Fiat. It's the Final Boss so to speak. So even if we use Crypto for eveything... eventually we will have to pay tax and have to convert (sell) back to fiat. Mass adoption (your end game) only happens when governments accept Crypto in place of Fiat.
-Most currencies or ancient denominations of value were referenced against something else to provide a concrete example of value. Even in your example you were referencing the price against Fiat.
Kudos to you though... a good post full of Hopium.

C'mon man. My main gripe with delusional Crypto proponents (not saying you are...) calling for overthrows of states or 'financial' revolutions don't know enough about history or social structures to propose any new system. Satoshi tried... but there are problems in his code.
So many people are waaaaay too quick to jump on the Crypto bandwagon and call for an overthrow of government or reguritate half baked *ideology* with no sense of real world history or application.
Not trying to sound better than anyone or pompous. Just wished more people would do their homework prior to making bold opinions based on little wherewithall.

Um. Disagree. He's a ruthless businessman who has been winning for decades. I like nothing about him but the guy is Teflon. Teflon Don the way he handles business and narrative.

Ron Paul... still at it. What a treat.

Damn... there's an awesome website that is super user friendly and very informative. There's a guy with a beard in the videos. Hopefully someone will post it...
I CAN tell you which ones to stay away from tho!!
Bitcoin.com isn't what it seems! It's complicated for a newbie... but there are a lot of "clones" and "lookalikes" that sound like 'Bitcoin' but aren't. Bitcoin Cash (Or Gold or Diamond or anything else) is DIFFERENT than Bitcoin.
My last piece of advice is to put in anywhere from 5-10 hours of researching and studying the technology and ways to "hold" your currency before buying. Do you homework and you'll feel more confident making decision later! Good luck and welcome!!!!

Is that a sticker? Or....? Explain plz

Not sure the pitch is enough to convince anyone. But the exposure is good I guess.

Do you think about what you're saying before you write it publically?
Consumption (micro OR macro) is not tied to accumulation of a currency. When people are "saving" it is usually extra cash they have hustled for beyond their own average levels of consumption.
And your second assumption is also ridiculous. The fact that I agree with Keynes on some things is purely coincidence from studying global economies.
Your logic is flawed and making massive assumptions about Bitcoin or people just weakens any point you're trying to make. (No offence intented).

Hahaha. Pretty much! Oh man... the more I learn about Crypto the more I realise that it's quite complex to understand the actual workings of the computing science. So I wouldn't say 'I understand' BTC anymore than I 'understand' fields I like, like say Quantum physics or Chess.
But yeah.... hahaha I'm Bullish at this point.

The critics agree: "This is baaaaalderdash... jabroni."
