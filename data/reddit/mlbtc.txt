Can we not associate Ayn Rand with Bitcoin?

No, I definitely get it. To be completely honest, it was rather difficult to find all that many Bitcoin products that fit that description so I did have to add those two as fillers. I did feel that Something Geeky worked as most of those products could be considered unique gifts.
Thanks for the input!

There's nothing wrong with keeping just one so you don't completely miss out if it blows up.

Don't invest anything in Bitcoin you aren't prepared to lose entirely.

If this happens I think we'll be seeing news articles about increased Newegg revenue because of accepting Bitcoin, and a bunch of other electronics retailers will jump on board as well.

I don't know the answer to your first question, not too experienced with mining contracts. Anyway, it looks like you can get 0.1 BTC coins from [Casascius]( Also, no one really knows when it will stop if it does crash. If we could tell these things with certainty, we'd all be millionaires. You can speculate, but many different factors come into play.

I've had a decent amount of success with focused niche websites and I've been so intrigued with Bitcoin that I thought I would give this a try. I'm still learning a lot about the currency but I've put a few articles up there and am going to add more as I research Bitcoin more and follow the news.
PLEASE let me know what you think. I find that the best way to build a site up is by just listening to what people want and delivering that. If you don't feel like it, a visit is fine as well! Thanks.

In 10 years, I think there's a decent chance it reaches ubiquity, at least on the internet. There's no reason it can't become the standard for payments at least on the internet, and at that level it would definitely purvey in a lot of real-world trade as well.
Then again, this is just me being hopeful. If it reaches this level, I think we're looking at somewhere between 50-100k per Bitcoin.

Nah, I'd say this isn't so bad. Most places that allow really quick/instant transfers make you pay a premium, whereas Coinbase has pretty reasonable prices. I wouldn't sweat the 10 days though, it will keep you from panic selling if things do go wrong. 
I bought at ~$400 right before the latest huge jump and I didn't actually receive the coins until a day after the $900 high. If I had access to them, I definitely would have considered selling at $600 because I thought it was going to continue dropping.

I see. Those prices are a bit off though. 1 BTC costs $807 on Coinbase right now. Ultimately though, your scheme isn't outlandish. People are willing to pay a premium on LocalBitcoins. AFAIK, people do what you're trying to do to some success already.

I've only ever heard very positive revies for LocalBitcoins, so if you're wondering about the reputability I'd say it's pretty safe. Just make sure you meet these people in a safe place such as a cafe in a nice area and maybe bring someone you trust - especially since you're under 18.
However, I'm unsure as to what your scheme is here. Do you mean you have Bitcoins and just want to sell them on LocalBitcoins for a bit more than you can get at exchanges, or do you want to buy at a place like Coinbase and resell on Localbitcoins?
