Things have definitely changed in the past 20 years.  But I think it's actually become **easier** to do this type of thing (eg: there are a lot more jobs these days that can be done remotely [although, along with that comes global competition from low-cost contractors from other countries with lower costs of living]).
Really, what it boils down to is: how much gumption and drive does a person have?  How badly do they want to make the world work the way *they* want it to, instead of just taking what is given to them?

Even a company as big and experienced as Apple still has problems with this: usually, the first version of any new X.0 iPhone has bugs in it that are fixed by the time version X.1 is released.

The downside is that it is sometimes done *without* the *owner's* permission, too.
While I like the idea of frictionless cash/currency movement, the idea that a hacker could drain my wallet(s) containing $84 million is a bit scary.

jabcde explained why a lottery is a bad idea if you're US-based.  And you replied with "blah blah blah anti-authority bullshit; we don't need no stinkin' permission."
You added *nothing* of value to the conversation, and you actually added **bad advice**.

The last bank account I had was in 1986.
It's quite easy to get by in life without one.

The last time I had heard about it, the number was $7 million.
But, yeah, a million bucks is not what it used to be.

jesus christ OP...read this before you start talking shit:
Right at the fucking top it explains **why** they did this:
*Over the past couple of weeks there has been a marked increase in the number of man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks against Tor users of web based Bitcoin wallet provider Blockchain.info. One user reported 63 bitcoin stolen, and there were many other examples as the thefts continued despite warnings to users. The attacks were so successful that Blockchain resorted to blocking all traffic to the wallet service from Tor exit nodes.
I’ve been working with Blockchain since Saturday to implement a number of security measures to better protect users. The main result of these efforts is that today we are announcing that Blockchain is now available as a hidden service on Tor with a signed SSL[1] certificate (provided by DigiCert) and HTTPS enforced across the site. The address is

i think it's worth noting though that the main difference is that with the internet you didn't have a bunch of wide-eyed zealots proclaiming that its eventual global domination was inevitable and that *those who don't embrace it now are idiots who will be sorry later that they missed the boat.*
those early internet people had something that is rare here in humility.

How's this?:

There are 2 reasons for leaving no tip: the person forgot, or they just don't tip ever.  Both of these suck for the server (eg: they get no $), but, hey, stuff happens and you deal with it.
But, when you leave a very small tip (eg: a penny or a few cents), then you are sending a **clear** message to the server that you did not like them (or you did not like their service).  This can be worse for the server because it's saying they did something wrong...and sometimes they don't know what it was.
*edit: btw, I have left the small "message" tip only a couple of times in my life.  And each time, as I left, I let the manager know why I was doing it, in the hope that they could explain to the server why I was not happy and hopefully the server could learn from the experience.

Playing devil's advocate, perhaps assume that the about statement is incorrect (eg: start with the assumption that you *did* send it to a hot wallet).  You may be leaving a solution path untravelled.

The word you are looking for is "fewer."
@_date: 2014-11-19 13:33:04


I don't mean to sound patronizing, but in case you're on a unix-based system, the normal "ls" command for displaying directory contents will overlook files that only have an extension (eg: .foobar).  To see those files, you would need to issues the "ls -a" command.
I mention this only in case the wallet software created backups or alternative files with only an extension for the name (some programs do this).

@_date: 2014-10-17 04:15:05
There is a chance that bitcoin really is going to take off.
If it does, then bitcoin programmers (think ecosystem, not kernel) will be highly sought after.  So he''ll either make a shit ton of money as a contractor or employee, or, he'll make a shit ton of money starting up a service that tons of people eventually use.
One the other hand, bitcoin may just die like so many other promising-looking technologies.  If so, then he'll maybe get out after a year or so, and then jump back into a traditional tech job.
None of us know which way it's going to go, and he's got his butt (heh) covered by his girlfriend while he takes this gamble.  It doesn't seem all that crazy, really.

when i was studying ai in college, i learned some neat techniques for remembering things.  writing things down by hand on paper was one of them.  definitely try it. :)

I have a feeling you'll be fine, dude.
I've been in your shoes before: 4 children and a wife, and I was the sole breadwinner.  Whenever I found myself in a position that I didn't like, I would bail and find something new.  In the programming world, it is easy as fuck to find a new gig.
My children are all grown now (the last one left for college last year) and I got to spend tons of quality time with them while they were growing up, and we never went hungry.  So I wouldn't change anything.
Fuck all the naysayers.  They think that there is just one "right" way to live.  Live **your** life the way you want to.  I suspect that you care for your family a lot more than these losers on here care for your family. ;)
@_date: 2014-10-26 17:33:25
Yes, you can.
And it is most certainly not hyperbole.
Where in the world did you get the misguided belief that you have to have a bank account in order to have a credit score?  Or, that a credit score is even a necessity to get by in the world?

Ah, OK.  Well, I pay for everything in cash (rent, bills, etc) and whenever I get paid for any programming work I do, I take the check and find the nearest branch of that bank to go to and cash it in person.

Face it: the people who had their $ and/or btc at mtgox were either lazy or greedy or too trusting.  None of those qualities is good, and it is absurd for any of those people to demand that karpeles be held to some high standard, when they themselves basically **threw their money and coins at him** and hoped for the best.  If not for them, he would not have amassed the immense power and responsibility that he ended up with.

While we're at it, let's get rid of encrypted hard drives, because the only reason anyone would want that is if they have illegal files that they want to hide from the authorities.
