This is far from true. There a 100's of cryptos, ALL of which are inspired by Bitcoin. It's the forks that claim to BE bitcoin that could be classified as attacks. There have been 2 of them this year


He's likely talking about Maxwell and other Core developers that get hated on so much. I feel this sub has a generally favourable opinion of Gavin. Mike too before the infamous rage-quit. Even then he still gets support, he did a lot for Bitcoin and it is generally acknowledged here amongst those that remember. Jeff, well Jeff decided to go rouge and develop the buggy 2x debacle and so has to lie in that ill-made bed unfortunately ;)

Oh real cool there Frogo.
Bitcoin is for everybody, even those that don't care for it as a payments solution.

You're swinging hard but still missing the point mate. Read the book.
@_date: 2019-01-03 22:13:09
To be fair, it is fucking amazing. :)

Add up all you've spent and work out the average. The lower it goes the more opportunity to buy some and lower that average. 
When this market turns around you want to have your bags packed already.

Can someone explain to me why a 2 week difficulty adjustment is the a sensible thing? Why not a much shorter algorithm? Why not every 6 blocks for instance?
@_date: 2019-01-03 17:49:47
The issue is not fractional reserve, it's monetary policy. Bitcoins hard-coded monetary policy fixes fractional reserve. 
@_date: 2018-02-21 19:47:42
You have nailed it. Latecomers want mad gainz and buy alts but after the parade is over the alts have no real innovation and are just nice logos with big claims and no development. Bitcoin is the orig, it's the oldest, most secure blockchain on earth. It has the most badass cypherpunk coders and has "died" 1000 times only to come back stronger and worth more. I would never sell bitcoin for *anything* let alone some kids new alt they made in their basement. 
**Buy BTC. HODL BTC.** You will be rewarded.

Check out The Bitcoin Standard by Saifedean Ammous. 
The economics of an economy based on Hard Money (Bitcoin) would be a different model akin to Austrian Economics. They basically say that money should never be inflated to 'protect' the economy and when boom bust cycles happen they are telling you information about the economy. 
If you artificially protect against this you are not absorbing that information or addressing the underlying issues and the cycle is worse rather than better. You can see this in the data, there have been more volitility and boom/bust cycles since the introduction of unbacked FIAT currency. 
It's interesting stuff, I'm still learning a lot myself.
@_date: 2018-02-12 23:11:22
I hardly understand any of this but THANK YOU GREG for your TIRELESS WORK and your BITCOIN (and TROLL FIGHTING) **SUPERPOWERS**. You are supported by the quiet majority. Code on.
@_date: 2019-01-03 22:17:15
DUDE. It's the most asymmetric bet you will get in your lifetime. How often do you get in before Wall St and big finance? You are witnessing a monetisation event. The monetisation of the first provably rare digital asset in human history. If you can appreciate the fucking unicorn in front of you, buy with both hands. Fuck I'm gonna buy more right now. Don't sell a satoshi until Bitcoin is passed golds marketcap. That is around $350,000 per BTC. 
@_date: 2019-01-03 16:18:05
To be fair, Saifedean Ammous who wrote The Bitcoin Standard would agree with Well to be precise, Bitcoin won't combat Banks, but it will combat Central Banks.
@_date: 2018-02-22 13:35:24
Yep this is the new  cry. Even though it's obvious that transactions are down because the spamming finally subsided (for now). Wouldn't surprise me if Roger started spamming Bcash to make it look like people use it more than Dogecoin (which they don't)

Actually, it's been shown that 78% of statistics are fabricated, but your point still stands.

Right! Oh, we need someone to buy at $1M too... 
@_date: 2018-02-12 12:22:58
So... did you?
@_date: 2018-02-21 14:57:11
If bitcoin reaches $1M after 6 years from now (after 2 halvings) then the daily reward will be more like $4.5B which is less than 1% of market cap. 4 years later it's half again - then again...
@_date: 2018-12-30 19:29:21
Extreme to others, but obvious to yourself. The trick is to not give yourself much to remember, but to give others a hell of a time. 
Say your seed was "fish table space dad" you could easily make a series of images that communicate that and just host them in a private folder amongst a bunch of other photos in your 2FA protected email. Even if someone hacked your email and searched for Bitcoin keywords, it would bring up nothing. They would have to know. That's not bad security, sure is fireproof which is kinda my point. If you have your seed stamped into metal then anyone else that finds it has a good idea it's something valuable, but a bunch of random photos, not at all...

@_date: 2018-12-30 14:06:36
Ah the old "Alts will make you richer" logic. As if Bitcoin isn't volatile enough! What makes me not get suckered into that is that I think IF crypto has a future, then Bitcoin is *more likely than not* to be a part of that. While any given alt is *more likely than not* not going to be part of it. So I bet on Bitcoin for that reason alone. And if it's not volatile enough for you, you can margin trade it! Good luck with that too!
@_date: 2018-12-31 15:02:53
The future is... silent.

It's cool but I change my cold storage address too often...
I think best is an extremely obfuscated online storage. As in hide your seed online, but in a very abstracted and not obvious way.
@_date: 2018-12-27 21:47:12
This, IMO, is a very good summary.
@_date: 2018-12-30 14:00:46
With pretty limited downside and practically unlimited upside, hell yeah, this is the most asymmetric bet this generation will ever have.
@_date: 2018-12-30 19:24:03
Well, this year it was claiming forks.
Andreas says to check/renew cold storage twice a year, but not sure where the thinking is with that. I'm guessing it's to reacquaint yourself the steps...
