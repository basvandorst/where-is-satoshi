Please do some research before you end up giving random people your hard earned money. Its not worth it to be ignorant.  Google is a great resource.

Thats a scam. There is no easy quick way to get rich unless you wanna scam other people like he is doing. Financial prosperity comes with time and patience.

I did exactly as you said but the electrum wallet says "Balance 0. mBTC" :/ and for some reason the receiving address is different within the electrum wallet than the bitcoin-qt wallet. Shouldnt the address stay the same since I imported the private key??

Literally I copied / pasted the address from "receiving adresses" to the console with "dumpprivkey" and it outputted with the key. When I import it into electrum it just say' s that a new address has been added. Some kind of error has occurred . Ive copied/ pasted the key multiple times to make sure I'm not making a mistake. Smh if it can happen, it will happen to me.

Lets be real here and face the facts. Without Ross and the Silk Road, bitcoin would not be where it is today. I think its safe to say bitcoin would have died off or the price would have stayed in the cent price range. He was the first to actually create a use for bitcoin. Leave your emotions at the door.

Lol wut. The dn isnt like the clearnet. You dont just buy domains from people, that woukd defeat the whole purpose. As a former user of the silk road I can tell you that he and a few other colleagues developed the site themselves.
