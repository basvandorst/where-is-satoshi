I see that it’s a book. I’m gonna pick it up right now but I read some financial/investment blogs or just articles and feel like if they’re already being advertised basically, that ship has sailed and it was either a flop and they want fresh money in to be able to cash out or it’s just beneficial to the people already in, and only potentially to any newcomers.

This is where I’m probably most lacking knowledge about, but I think that acknowledgment that there is an illusion that coin is only used for nefarious is absolutely necessary. 
There will have to be strides made in the shape of intentional and transparent distancing from the bad apples so to speak. They might (may?) still be able to function in the unavoidable black market that exists just the same with fiat money. But that should not be of interest to people like you or I. Law breakers gone break. 
I cannot imagine a law that outright bans the use of coin. Having already had 10 or is it 12 years of use with the govs knowledge of it already without any legislative action. 
Maybe the bottled “juice” will be regulated in order to let the banks use and profit from the services it will offer, the sweet unadulterated form will still be available. 
I am open to hearing any changes you think could change this.

It’s not a necessary income. Maybe in wording it wrong. I’m going to be in school full time and we’re gonna be living off my SOs income plus what I already have coming in from previous endeavors. I was under the impression that cloud mining was at least kinda profitable in the long run, plus it’s already kind ofc a hobby. I knew that solo mining wouldn’t turn a profit. I don’t know enough about stocks to get started in that. but there,is no “timeline” if there’s no way to make money work for you in the crypto world in this day in age or if it’s way above the 600$ entrance fee then that’s ok. 
I would still consider spending way less and setting up like a usb raspberry pi farm just for science. Knowing it’s not gonna turn a profit and it sounds like anything to do with coin and profit is just to buy low, hold and sell never

Ok I’ll try to respond but I’m not as educated about it as you. 
You’re right about the fear instilled in people by the original uses of coin. However, until it is adopted by a great majority in any form, and while it might be in some watered down, bank controlled form. Mainly for Joe Schmoe shopping at Costco every Sunday. As long as you and I can still have and keep coin in our own private wallets, we will be able to enjoy the mainstream acceptance of coin. 
Coin, intentionally, can have some bank offer ways to “hold it” for people that need someone to hold their hands and still, underneath that layer, we will be able to use or hodl the coin we all know and love and benefit greatly from it having that watered down “juice” form being offered by institutions. 
I for one look forward to the mas adoption of any body because at the moment, yes people who own the most coin do have some unintended (by the creator) control over the state of coin.  Once people can take out their phone and open they’re Bank of America app and access their btc checking account and use QR code to pay for their groceries. Then we can use our way to go down to Tesla and purchase a car in btc. 
I yield back time.

Sorry one more. Have you heard of jury nullification? Let’s say it does become illegal to hold or use coin outside of a licensed institution. If you are not committing crimes that are obviously polarizing or against the moral compass of most, and if the majority of the jury consisting of 12 of your peers also has and uses coin, will they convict? Or will they use their right to say “hey listen, we know there’s some law but most of think it’s bogus. We’re are not going to convict this here gentlemen or gentle lady. The honest truth, your honor.”

Either way it’s only things like mris and other things to substantiate my medical diagnoses and current treatment so I will do all of that since we both know it’s not a scam. I wish the doc could speak freely regarding this. They have in the past but I don’t know if it’s because of the pressure from the abcs or something else but there’s been a definite change in demeanor.

Well this isn’t a get rich quick question. I was just genuinely curious if it was possible to make any kind of profit doing something I already enjoy doing while I go to school and the dollar amount is what I’d financially ok if lost because I always follow the rule of only spend/invest/whatever what you can afford to lose.
@_date: 2019-12-06 23:28:24
Me you
@_date: 2019-12-15 20:33:08
Essentially. But also it means that those that are mining, an already cost heavy task that is rarely profitable, will now receive half of whatever reward they may or may not haven been receiving so the motivation to mine for those already mining decreases and the incentive for new miners is hard to sell

I don’t. I was under the impression there were some legit cloud mining site’s and have been “woke.” If I did anything involving mining it would be just for fun and obviously a liability rather than an asset. 
One thing I’m doing that didn’t cost more than 20$ plus an rpi is already have is xyo coin geomining. I paid for just the shipping on something called a sentinel that you out in your Keys etc. You run an app on your phone and let it run while you do ur daily stuff. The interface looks like google maps and every 30,seconds or so you “mine” and get points which can be withdrawn for they’re token which is currently worth like .00003$ usd I believe. You need to get 10,000 points to withdrawal to tokens to withdrawal to coin, an erc20 wrapped eth based coin iirc,  then you exchange in one of a couple exchanges that deal with it. 
The dummies fall for the trap or they’re monthly plus and pro memberships at like 20 and 35$ usd respectively that promises quicker and bigger mines. The sentinel itself increases UPTO 12x your mines and having a bridge allows you to share sentinels if you have more then one. You can then put one on your wife’s keys and when the sentinel returns “home” where the bridge is, it dumps all the data and you get the points. 
Anyways my point is obviously the location data is worth enough to them to have this business model. Will it blow up and become huge? Probably not. Would I lose money? $12 shipping for the sentinel, battery life while driving and mining, and data (I have unlimited but you still have to include in costs.) yes but I’ll be ok.

You just need to download the cash app for iOS or android. It’s nothing special really. You can buy coin within I the app but the card requires fiat money and even though I haven’t tried to, i i think you have to pre-selll crypto and then use the card.

Very good read. The couple places I looked at offered live “monitoring” of your rental and had chooses of different coin to mine and also allowed you to buy the asic miner at any point.  IRRc you buy too offs, which are like prepaid electricity cards that offer such and such kw and then choose what machine you would like to use. That knee was less of a contract and more of a pay as you go, but you could prepay for a year. Again, I’d have to check again but I think it gave you the choice to pay for maintenance with your “rewards” or with alternate payment which included bank transfer or debit cards.  You could also start with debit card or btc or bank wire. I’ll have to recheck.

Hold on. I did this into my blockchain account which is how I found out there was coin sitting in a few addresses. It told me how much.

So no one has really answered the question. If they had $600 going into 2020 to set something up that could potentially make money, what would it be? I’ve heard but coin and hodl but I doubt they’d use all 600$ on that. Should I just find a high yielding savings account and put it in? I’ll be working on a degree if some sort during this time so there’s no timeline. I figured being able to regular collect any earnings would be next to impossible on such small capital but hey, I hope once I get a degree in something in the stem field and hopefully find a job that pays well, I’ll have more money to “play” with.
