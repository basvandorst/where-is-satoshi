Ohh OK thanks that helped a lot! I was picturing something like that except the arrangement of the number pad randomizes after every digit entered

I think you just pointed out the main issue.. the words 'cent' and 'dollar' are very different, whereas 'bit' and 'bitcoin' are quite similar, one even containing the other. This would most likely cause some degree of confusion to the layman (someone who only uses bitcoin, not understands or follows it closely) or new users.

$3.50 for a pint? Not around here

How so? A bit would be a type of coin so logically a bit coin = the coin of a bit... Now compare bit coin to bitcoin

So kind of like a runescape bank pin in theory? Just trying to picture the interface

You do realise that in NK you can be executed for viewing foreign media? You seriously think that that kind of leadership is better than US government?

No, if nobody sold at a specific price, then the excess demand will push the price higher until a seller meets the demand

I found this very interesting! Thank you for sharing your work. May I ask how long it took to write it all out? How many people worked on the excel sheet?

I may be wrong, but doesn't having different increments on the first graph axes make the whole graph misleading? the Y-axis is increasing in stages of 100 while the X-Axis is increasing in stages of 10
