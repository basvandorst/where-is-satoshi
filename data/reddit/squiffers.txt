He makes comparisons to how the WWW and GPS are free and open systems, while Facebook is very centralised and controls a lot of data. He suggests that blockchain technology will revolutionise this field, allowing for open database projects and companies to develop. Possibilities are endless yadda yadda.
BTC helped to show the world this was possible, but might fade away to obscurity as the blockchain technology improves and overshadows it

Nothing. But the guy on the other side of the deal could do the opposite.
The only way for this to balance out is for the price to become significantly more stable, which means it has to be worth a LOT more.

There's nothing stopping you doing this. Look up arbitrage. It will be very difficult though due to fees and bots trading very quickly

I don't see how bitcoin price doesn't skyrocket and stabilise once wall Street are able to trade against it.
Think about it - at the moment they can leverage against the price AND influence the price by buying relatively small amounts compared with what they could make leveraging. They could make ridiculous money if that held true - the only way for this to stabilise is if bitcoin becomes much less volatile i.e. much higher price
