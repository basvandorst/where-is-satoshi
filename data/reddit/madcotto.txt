I guess you want hands off but if you could find someone trustworthy then a BTC version of sites like  But WITHOUT the sites cut.  I'm sure you could give a project like this a kickstart and help more people in return as more donate.  the site could be run as a charity itself and have an optional donation for costs.

@_date: 2014-12-08 16:48:17
I collect physicals on a small basis and for me its a mixture of reasons one been cold storage but also the art of the item and also a must is to be a limited edition.  this gives some coins value above the btc value on them (and hopefully future rarity value).  
A great example of this is the Kialara coin, which is a masterpiece when it comes to btc physicals. 
This coin doesn't appeal to me as imho it looks horrid and cheep and has a massive markup over the btc value on them and i don't believe they will have a huge appeal to collectors in the future. but i could be wrong.

Some people are making returns from sites like this BUT they are a massive risk,  nomatter how well a guys profile can look it can be faked and nomater what reassurances the website gives you if the guy just ups and runs with your money.  just ask yourself what kind of possibility do you have in tracking down and getting your bitcoins back from some guy on the other side of the planet.
Im not saying dont, im just saying go into this with open eyes ;)
@_date: 2014-10-16 14:40:37

just to add a warning here and people can take it how they see fit.  
I once worried about sudden death and how my children could benefit and or deal with my online life which in some cases is tighter than a ducks ass that its a pain in the ass for me.  
so i came up with the idea of a encrypted file on my comp, which was basically my will and any details they would need.  i had the password for this file engraved on the inside of a ring that i wore at all times. 
seems fine right well i had to tell people the purpose of these silly numbers and letter on the inside of my rind so once i died they would know what to do with this info.  
This was when i hit on the problem that the kids got obsessed with getting this password off the inside of my ring and every chance they had they would try and take it off me even when alseep, it turned into a game for them. 
well i had to destroy that ring and file to stop it. 
so just a warning there about having stuff on a ring. just my experience but if anyone has a good idea on how to securely pass on bitcoins or other digital assets when you die please tell me.

@_date: 2014-04-15 16:42:38
to me i wasent looking at the dollar value as most things bitcoin shouldent. this set cost me 0.3btc over the btc value and thats not much for a item such as this that will have a collectors value one day... hopefully.... fingers crossed and all that

Instant Online bank verification requires your login credentials to establish a payment method by securely connecting with your bank account, and to verify that you are the account holder. We need to make sure that you’re the one providing us with your information, and nobody else is pretending to be you.
Once you provide the bank login, a service we use called Yodlee will connect with your account and verify the information you’ve provided. Yodlee is an industry-leading and trusted service, used by major financial companies and banks such as  Paypal, Mint.com, Citibank and Bank of America. Your login credentials are never stored, and are never used again after this verification.
 
If you are uncomfortable providing your login credentials, you may choose the Micro-Deposit bank verification option. This does not require your login credentials.

Even if you ignore the scam sites 99% of legit cloud mining is so expensive you will never ROI. if you can get it cheep enough then you can ROI but only just and anything you gain after it is mostly dust.  i have ROI on one cloud mining company in 4 months but the jury is still out if its a ponzi or not and could dissapear at anytime.  My advice buy and hold

@_date: 2017-09-04 17:01:38
maybe.  Like governments could ban it and the price will crash badly.  but its too late the cats out the bag.  and if that did happen the darknet market alone will keep it having some value and ill buy buy buy.  I'm not in this for a few years I'm in this for my kids future or possibly my grandkids futures.  Ill be long dead before whatever form wins out but BTC will always be the grandad.  At the verry least treating it as the hobbie and game that i do i could possibly have a good sentimental high score.

Never sell.  didn't the bible say you can take what fits through the eye of a needle? or something? I'm going for the high score lol
@_date: 2017-09-04 19:01:20
I think they changed the system now and a lot better stamping.  you should do better.  hopefully.
@_date: 2017-09-03 18:55:10
who uses paper money anyway. i only have £20 on me at any one time just in case I need it for random taxi/bus or sending my Son up shop for some beers.
@_date: 2017-09-04 15:35:43

@_date: 2017-10-19 20:36:22
as it loads see all the times you sold.  ik I did :/
@_date: 2019-09-19 15:54:01
I do want one but I can't imagine they are selling fast at that price,  esp the markup on the gold value alone.

USB sticks are more likely to be put in a pocket by some chancer esp one that looks flashy.

I won the other night, its no scam but support does suck now.  i had a issue recently and never got a reply,  where in the old days you would always get it sorted.  
@_date: 2015-03-12 18:16:05

@_date: 2015-10-30 03:37:17

After bugging my family about BTC since 2012. mum rang me up all excited it was on the news.  her words were:

People used silk road because it Was illegal.  There are some markets today that deal in BTC but all will be crushed by Ebay if they ever decided to accept it.  Nothing competes with them, in any great volume.

I've had a Cryptosteel since the first batch from kickstarter.  I still haven't done it as it's fiddly.  consider how lazy you are esp if you already have a fire safe ;)
@_date: 2017-07-23 14:10:24
Why? /s
@_date: 2017-07-26 21:06:48
Does this mean we owe Mark Karpeles a huge apology even if his security was crap?
@_date: 2017-07-22 12:53:50
I got my first edition signed by you. Dam you were right your handwriting is almost as bad as mine ;)
@_date: 2017-07-23 12:44:58
Something I needed to hear and often thanks.  You never really can get over what you spent/lost in the early days and constantly waiting for a crash (like EVERYONE is doing) isn't really going be down to as low as you want it. you prob won't be a Bitcoin millionaire anymore but you could have a decent retirement fund.  Short of some MAJOR disaster.

Its been a while i forgot about all that suff,  but like said it was all brand new and grew huge (for the time) fast.  I remember buying there at something like $3 to pay for a VPN thinking the whole anon thing that was said a lot back then but even at the price I was like this is a huge dam scam.  I forgot about it till a year later to renew my VPN and could pay with some dust I had thinking this great free VPN not putting 2 and 2 altogether that this thing is really making ground.  We all made extremely bad mistakes back then many coins were lost by many people and then it exploded.   Im not excusing what Mark did and said but he was way out of his depth but it now "looks like" he didn't just pull a huge exit scam.

Just like every lair i ever met in life.  soon as they questioned or have to prove there words its everyone else's fault.  and all defensive or aggressive.
I'm disappointed,  I started to believe it was CW from the first time.  Why carnt SN be a asshole? 
@_date: 2017-07-27 02:50:40
stop talking sense about coinbase and how someone with 200k lost is just writing a Reddit post 3 months later.
@_date: 2016-07-23 10:13:56

It's not just going be low, it's going be low for a long ass time. IMO
@_date: 2017-06-04 03:18:16
Thanks for posting this.  I didn't store mutch on any exchange but as I don't day trade I saw no reason for it be there. pulled it all out.  took a while which worried me. but all was good and I'm out.  hold not fold.
@_date: 2017-06-27 14:53:05
What are you offering other than a few easily precut and drilled pieces of metal and some off the shelf bits and bobs?
Also, you expect people to stamp these at home as perfect as your mockup in a home environment without any miss strikes from people who new to hitting things precisely with a hammer and are probably at best doing it on the floor?
@_date: 2017-06-27 17:07:23
There you go, my man.  start your own Kickstarter or someone pls I'm way too lazy but would actually buy something like this with facy artwork (yes I'm aware of the risk but meh)
@_date: 2017-06-28 06:15:40
ik so was I ;)
@_date: 2017-06-27 05:46:11
cough 'Ripoff' cough '
@_date: 2017-06-27 15:18:54
Bet you won't put any of that in your kickstarter?  
and I'm not saying you trying to say your superior im saying you offering a simple product (peice of metal) that's vastly inferior to cryptosteel that is a fully manufactured finished product.  you offering a piece of metal and a stamp kit?  im not saying it's not nice it is, but unless its $20 at most its a compleet ripoff.  but follow your dreams and im sure you'll do ok.  I been burnt many times on kickstarter to see things for what they are.
@_date: 2017-06-06 00:36:36
I opened one of these back when it was like $200 I was desperate for money at the time.  sucks man I loved that coin.  guess i still got the coin itself if a little messy :/
@_date: 2017-06-06 00:50:38
that's it I'm keeping my empty coin FOREVER
@_date: 2017-06-27 08:43:47
It at best has to survive a house fire.  you not trying to keep it in terminators back pocket.
@_date: 2013-12-02 09:58:15
