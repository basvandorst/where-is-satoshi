I'm not sure if it's still Tru. But you might consider buying off local bitcoins. You use to be able to do free transfers between localbitcoins users.
@_date: 2018-01-26 05:29:48
Alternatively. I think gemini introduced a minibus transfer size, but they still give 30 fee free btc sends a month.
@_date: 2018-01-26 05:48:48
Yeah gemini is great. It looks like they changed it to 10 a month free though. Also i feel like they might have have added a mininum send.
@_date: 2018-01-20 13:39:38
Gemini is a good alternative.

I would say that there is a difference between the fact that systems obviously tend towards centralization in information exchange and forced centralization. Like the internet in concept is decentralized. You can make peer to peer connections. But the majority of peoples interaction is with a couple popular websites. And that's OK. The alternativea still exist.

I mean there is so much economic incentive to use segwit when you can right now. You'd think people would notice.
@_date: 2017-12-26 01:31:42
But on btc. Segwit transactions are unequivocally cheaper since they're smaller... The higher the fees the more it affects it since it's a fixed percentage reduction.

I don't really understand what you're saying. But look at  . They've been working on a eth-backed USD peg for awhile
@_date: 2018-09-10 17:02:02
No I mean I don't get what he's proposing on his dollar peg. You can't just assume the peg doesn't fail.

I mean. The only thing left is btc is mainly as a trustless store of value. Having something with the relative stability of USD, but the utility of crypto is more useful to many people as a currency (even if not trustless)
@_date: 2017-08-29 22:38:25
Wait how does that affect Bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-06-02 15:15:31
This looks like a relatively "simple" lawsuit hopefully. They couldn't justify it at all so they forgot to even start a civil forfeiture case. This shit sucks.
@_date: 2019-10-19 23:30:43
Sigh. Anyone else remember the good old days when people at least pretended that they wanted to use Bitcoin as an actual currency instead of as a get rich quick scheme?
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:57:57
Well a bit less popular, but still somewhat less well know is Santoshi. It's just still in exchange rates that are hard to understand though. I guess now around 10000 Santoshi to a dollar or 1000 Santoshi to a penny usd.
It is also the actual basic unit.

Wait has Berkshire Hathaway not done stock splits or released non voting partial stock?
@_date: 2017-04-28 22:35:50
.... Did you hold ppc too?

You would be complete vulnerable to any other hacks that come out.
@_date: 2018-03-26 06:25:31
What threshold do they use?
@_date: 2019-01-06 22:55:49
Um. Why not? That's what it's called. Atomic means that both are swapped at the same time
@_date: 2017-10-10 15:32:31
Man, just that alone makes me more than a little envious of the Netherlands.
@_date: 2018-02-20 17:08:54
Well technically 1.16% of all banks. Buts it's really not like the government wouldn't just start printing money at that point. They're not gonna risk bank runs again.
@_date: 2018-04-02 02:33:00
There is a deep economic comparison in the Article.
@_date: 2019-09-29 11:47:22
Minor nitpick. Checking solutions is usually polynomial time. Wouldn't take 10,000 years (usually)
@_date: 2018-04-02 07:21:10
Uhhh. But this one in particular. The DATE of publication is of note.
@_date: 2018-04-02 02:30:25
It's hilarious and a bit sad isn't it?
@_date: 2018-04-02 02:32:12
The article =P
@_date: 2018-04-02 02:31:53
The paper covers that.
@_date: 2018-04-02 02:31:34
Click the article. They have a paragraph about your specific case.
@_date: 2018-04-02 02:30:50
@_date: 2018-04-02 02:33:47
Nah. Together it's 9 fold each
@_date: 2018-04-02 02:33:25
Nah the paper says it's cause unicorn s.
@_date: 2018-04-02 02:29:43
Lol. I love that this proves absolutely no actually reads reddit articles.
@_date: 2018-04-02 02:30:40
Click the article mate
@_date: 2018-12-21 21:35:48
The cut axis are a bit annoying on this graph.

Company goes bankrupt. Investor cries and screams about investment advice he found on Reddit.
