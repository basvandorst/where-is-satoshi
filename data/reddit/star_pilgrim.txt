Well, they are legitimate customers just as you are.
And it really really really does not matter if you hate it.
Besides, how do you as a retailer brand certain customers as miners?
Just because they buy 10 cards at once?
They could be a reseller, jsut buying the lot.
Do you limit purchases to 1 per customer?
Makes any legal sense?
It is up to Nvidia and AMD to increase the supply, not the customers to stop buying.

Stick to nano.
Best price/performance, if you will.
There are more expensive and secure ones out there, but truly, unless you have many thousands in your portfolio, it is not worth it.

Well if the number of miners remains the same, the network will adjust difficulty to match,... if mining becomes less profitable and miners drop out,.. the network will adjust difficulty.

Evil orange bright eyes in the depths of finance, looked upon this and its gaze went straight to TorGuard.
It now pierces with intent, the intent to scheme and burn down this comming reality in its infancy.
So now, I wait for news how some government cracks down on outlawing proxies, TOR,... anything that disables them to achieve their dominance over crypto.
Trust me, this was a signal to banks. A drop of blood was sniffed by sharks in the financial shark dominated waters.
It is coming.
As LN grows, more and more bad press will come out, more and more pressure is going to be exerted on exchanges, etc.
The pandoras box was opened. This is the start of a revolution.

I have a similar story but I had like 3400 BTC and lost it, by way of throwing old HDD away.

Some follow 50/25/25 % rule.
50% = Bitcoin
25% = any other top 5 coins
25% = any starting coin that shows potential and you want to try your luck.
@_date: 2018-01-29 11:01:28
Many, yes.
But not MOST.
Also, the price will rise again the close we get to the end of the year.
Just look at past graphs etc.
This time of year it is the shittiest for BTC.
And most new people try to ascribe some meaning to it by blaming one altcoin or another, or even news in the press,.. because it MUST align with their narrow time slice, else it makes no sense to them.
LN nodes are growing by the day, and BTC will recover past anyones expectation. Then they will blame something else and say it is a bubble. SOMETHING must make sense in their mind,.. so anything goes.
There are many better blockchains out there, right now than BTC, but BTC is still the gold standard everyone gravitates towards, because it weathers change so well.
Once Lightning network is spread and used widely, BTC will beat them all (security, speed, low fees, contracts,... anything you want).
@_date: 2018-01-27 19:35:40
There needs to be awareness of Lightning network mainnet, if you want to do it even faster with less fees.
Now that proper wallets are being built.

Miners will suffer until there is a much greater adoption of bitcoin.
If there is a great BTC adoption, this means more transactions, more transactions means higher BTC price, higher BTC price means the mined rewards are bigger since BTC they get as a reward is worth more. This offsets the cash they now get from transactions also.
There surely will be a tough transition period and many won't survive.

Every transaction is TAXable if you live in the US.
They see all your transactions on the exchange and simply you need to give them the US worth being exchanged.
That's right, they put that duty on you. You must know the exact amount being exchanged in USD every time.
So if you make 5 transactions, and each with a different currency/coin/token, you need to write down how much you traded, and what the currency was worth at the time when exchange took place, so they know how much tax you need to pay in USD.
Thank Trump, his stupidity or ignorance knows no bounds.

If you want to circumvent the government handout (taxes), then yes it is illegal.
Same as it is illegal if you take 30.000 $ of your own money from the bank and transfer it across the border.

Looking in the past to project the future is notoriously pathetic and pointless.
No different than playing the lottery. You "might" get it right, then again you can be horribly wrong, which is mostly the case for 99% of predictions.
Market is intertwined tightly to the current political theater, regulations, newsmongering, and other events such as public awareness (more new people coming in).
You can NOT predict for most of those factors.... so really, looking at past graphs and trying to project something is like giving a drooling retarded person a crayon and ask him to draw you a graph.
Sure, one may argue that learning the past might help you predict the future,... but come on man. Reality is different.
@_date: 2018-01-23 10:19:21
Saying so, does not make it so.

Crypto is the future.

Yeah well futures are dangerous only if there is a large volume traded either way.
So it can make BTC more stable or destabilize it completely, depending of what the price of BTC is when the futures expire.
So it can be a bad thing or a good thing but it is neither in itself.
Just a bet that can go wrong horribly or amazingly well.
@_date: 2018-01-26 08:31:58
That is why we have large pools.
And no there can not be winners all around.

How would you explain the Dollar value to someone?
The paper itself holds no value.
Magic numbers on the bank computers holds no value.
What does give it value then?
Trust and broad adoption.
Now if Dollar was silver backed or gold backed,... and not printed in trillions whenever they need more, that would have tangible value towards which you can point to.
Today? No way in hell.
It has 0 value.
So, trust the crypto and decentralization. That is the only way the banks can't fuck with you. In fiat, banks can simply freeze your account, or forbid you to send money overseas in the amount you want, they can tax you if issue exorbitant fees that make no damn sense in wire transfer.... they are fucking you sideways and you do not even know it.
So join the revolution and trust in crypto. Learn about the tech and it's limitations and how they will be overcome in the future.
Knowledge is power.

They keep saying that for the dollar for decades. :D
And as long as people keep trading with Bitcoins, there is no bubble.
I mean, everything financial today is a bubble of one form or another.
But it has been used as fear mongering tactics currently, because it is easy to do so.
Just a little article here and there or news on the TV, Bitcoin this, Bitcoin that,.. BUBBLE.
It is a viable technology, and as long as people use it the "bubble" will not burst.

Well, gold and diamond mining,.. and rare earth mining consumes WAAAAAAY more power than mining BTC does.
And on top of that it is much more environmentally destructive and poisonous.

Because they can, and because in their mind it is worth it.

Because they believe it is worth that much.

This is a ledger, so any and all transactions are public.
It is the best kind of breadcrumb.
I am sure there are ways around for primary criminals, but sooner or later someone down the chain gets fucked.
Like the story the other day on some big exchange, who would freeze the account of some person and put him under police investigation, just because he wanted to change some coins he bought which were "marked".

Naturally it will.
But you can't expect it to go up and up and up at a steady pace.
Most of last year, not much happened and it stayed around 1000$, then it started climbing like crazy.
It is well due for a major correction. 
But things are looking up with the Lightning Network gaining adoption.

It is not at all as easy as you make it.
TOR network is extremely secure.
Each node only knows the node before it and ahead of it,.. it does not know the full path of the data.
You would have to have a full network of nodes doing the snooping and filtering, then piece together data in a true detective work fashion, in order to even have a chance of finding what or who is communicating where.
So in some extreme cases, authorities CAN be successful,.. but seriously, seriously rarely.

@_date: 2018-01-19 19:09:41
Not directly.
But in the end, higher difficulty, less rewards. 
And miners keep on joining the craze, creating more hash power and even less rewards, and difficulty again goes up to adjust.
Vicious circle that makes miners get paid less, and only go after lucrative pools, leaving low paying fee transfers in the gutter.
@_date: 2018-01-23 14:00:09

We have all the tech in the world right now to get rid of fiat and the control of banks.
Problem is only in the adoption, not implementation.
On top of that we have smart contracts and other technologies that could help with other sectors like judiciary, eGovernment,... you name it.

Yep, exactly the same as the dollar, only they don't just print more when it goes down.
The dollar would behave even worse if they din't print more and more.

I was talking about the fact that if you want to trade with BTC you must be prepared to loose it all. Same as with gambling.
That is true, so GTFO.

Wow this is growing fast. :o
By the end of the year we should have 1 million nodes and several million channels, easy.
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:20:22
Probably bot traders and mining pools.
They need to sell if they want to pay for electricity and moving (out of China) costs.
New facilities cost money.
@_date: 2018-01-24 07:14:24
After each transaction the channel must be closed.
Not sure if you can have many channels opened at the same time.
That would be 101 use case for malicious traffic spamming right there.

Hardly, as it works on proven technology already employed in other technologies for years.
It has just been re-purposed and implemented for crypto.

Mere competition is not worrying.
BTC evolves with time as well.
Lightning Network and all.
I see January as simply a brief dip in a year long chart.
No reason to lose faith in this tech, especially BTC since it holds value so well over time.
Also BTC is way more known to a common person.
People don't talk about some fucked up altcoin (even if it is superior to BTC). they don't even talk about crypto in general,.. no they talk about Bitcoin.
THAT is all that matters. Peoples perception.

You simply can not shut down this "revolution".
Because that is what it is. A revolution.
People stand against banking cartels across the world.
Fuck em. There is much more of us than there is them.
And this number will only grow.

It is about trust and transparency.

@_date: 2018-01-19 21:04:24
Why ow why ow why do you think paypal is not being used in the crypto world.
I ask you again, apply logic, or go read some.
In crypto world, all transactions are final. That is the underlying tech and POINT of them really.
Paypal program enables people to hold transactions by the balls a month later. DISPUTE is a no go in crypto,... so. It just won't fly.
If you bought BTC from me with Paypal, we do the transfer the Paypal can NOT see and verify,... then you accuse me that I did NOT send you BTC, and you open a dispute with me as my customer. Paypal could withhold funds from me through my bank account.
Sorry but this simply will NEVER ever EVER !!! work.
So forget about Paypal.
Open up an account on exchange, then transfer funds to it and do business like everyone else.
Buy BTC and pay for mining with BTC. You can pay with credit card but fee is larger and it takes longer.
@_date: 2018-01-18 14:13:56
It still has to go a long way to where it was.

Some Kratom are like nothing really,.. well at least you feel nothing but slight euphoria and that's it.
@_date: 2018-01-23 19:30:23
The only rule, going into crypto is if you buy some, DO NOT sell at anything lower than what you bought it at.
Simply hold it until it raises well above or at least until you do not see red numbers when all is factored in when converting back into fiat.
Nothing else should really matter.
@_date: 2018-01-17 11:41:47
It will be a year at least for early adoption and making it easy for users, like current wallets are.
@_date: 2018-01-15 13:25:17
Or the fee was that high?
It gets automatically deducted.
@_date: 2018-01-21 15:46:55
It will NEVER be over.
Buy BTC because you trust/believe in it, not because you want to make a quick buck.
The governments are basically bought out by banking cartels, and they will never allow crypto unless it is their own and which they can control. It is about control, power is secondary and it comes as a benefit.
@_date: 2018-01-25 21:58:17
People gamble their savings away on daily basis.
I don't see anyone complaining in Vegas or elsewhere.
This is no different.

It really is no different, and it is way more legit, or at least lucrative with higher chances of success than gambling.

It's like gambling.
Do you trust your luck?
You might strike gold, or you may loose it all.
Sorry but this is the unavoidable truth of today's crypto market.
Sure some lucky traders get rich, some other poor suckers loose their "investment".
It is nothing more than a speculation at this point.
And yeah there still exist "Unicorn" coins that could net you 1000% return. Finding one for sure is like playing a lottery.
If ANYONE could be sure that a certain coin will get them 1000%, then you would see everyone investing in that coin.
The best bet you can make is to do some research on your own, and diversify among prospect coins on the rise. Specially in the anonymity crypto coin market.
@_date: 2018-09-06 09:50:26
Compare all the enrgy used for mining to actual gold mining and you will see a HUUUUUGE !!!!! difference.
Bitcoin mining is nothing,.. like literally nothing.
@_date: 2017-12-27 13:06:30
Simply put, you can't.
The fees are just too high for something like that. I mean, there are some BTC creditcards tied to an exchange etc. But they simply do not work as you think they do (traditional way).
Some Altcoins were created, which could be used for that, but they lack adoption.
Also Bitcoin is in the midst of an upgrade/change. Perhaps Lightning network, which will enable us to do just that. A lot of hopes are riding on that.
And then again, come 2020 miner reward will be halved, which will have tremendous repercussions for bitcoin.
Lose miners = lose coin security. 
So fees will have to be higher or the BTC price will need to double,... something has to give.
But that is a problem 2 years down the road, that has nothing to do with your issue,.
Sorry for bringing it up.
@_date: 2017-12-27 17:06:32

Kinda impossible for businesses to go this route since the fees are not fixed and can drastically change negatively upwards as the network becomes more popular.
And 1&amp; is FUCKING LAUGHABLE \(since this is lightning network not an exchange\).

I pray for the day when cryptos become an actual currency which does not need to be exchanged for fiat at all.

This is why I was very careful with wording.
Look up statistics and you will see a contrast comparison of what and how was hacked. And how often that even happened.
Hell, there are thousands percent more shark attacks according to statistics than there are hardware wallet abuses.
Use a paper wallet then, or any other way more secure method if you like.
Fact remains that no exchange is safe, and NO ONE should be using them as their personal wallet. No one.

It is supply and demand.
Hoodling / not sellin, drives the prices up.
But since we have these fucked up whales that sell  boatloads no matter what, the prices go down.
Trend continues and they are happy.
Because then they can friggen buy uber cheap.
They cause this manipulation and sheep follow suit.

Hacks are nothing new.
There will ALWAYS be hacks.
I really don't know why people spread FUD over hacks and why it influences the market so much.
Crypto is not bad.
Crypto is not insecure.
The Exchanges are.

Success rate has nothing to do with how the LN was designed.
Channels need to become more loaded, and large transfers will become possible as well.
But what is or is not possible is beside the point.
LN was made for micro transactions in a time when BTC transfer fees were stupid high and when it took ages to even process the transfer.
Now, BTC it is extremely fast and very cheap. So I really don't get it why anyone would want to use LN for transferring $300 worth of BTC in the first place.

Sure they have,... all over the world.
But each and every time, the conversion is made on the exchange, taxes and licenses are paid etc.
Since bitcoin is not officially recognizable currency, or legal tender, it can not be used for any kind of legal purchase.
It always comes down to some exchange conversion at the last step.
The scenario where the person accepts bitcoin and hands over the house keys, and writes the house to that person, can be considered a gift or similar, since no currency was exchanged,... only some arbitrary virtual "assets" that have no value of any kind on in them selves.
It is like me trading you a pack of chewing gum for your house, and you hand me the keys and write the paper that you GAVE me your house and I gave you a pack of chewing gum. Replace chewing gum for any arbitrary item,... a clay figurine for example, something that has no recognizable value.

As long as there exists software that can track any and all transactions from any and all addresses, you can not escape the trail.
There is no obfuscation possible today in BTC.

If I sell my email messages and people agree to pay it, why should the government have something out of that?
I did not sell some physical thing, all I did was push a button and some electrons moved on the internet, like they do for every damn message.
It is no different than cash even. It is paper, and it holds some value.
If I choose to sell someone 10 Australian dollars for $100 US dollars, and if that person agrees, why the hell must I pay tax on the profit I made?
@_date: 2018-03-22 12:53:24
Well, but a legitimate concern can be given in this case.
If country has a specific law that forbids any CP medium or online directory,.... BTC blockchain contains it, but it is not freely explorable. 
It takes great skill to even find it and translate it into web pages.
So they can either point a finger and condemn it or they can look the other way because of this difficulty of actually
@_date: 2018-02-10 13:28:26
Well it kinda is the same as gambling in a Casino.
Only, it is more prolonged with lesser rewards and far more risk over time.
Sure, you can hit a jackpot if you HOODL over 5 year timeframe and find out your crypto went 10x, but you never know when the dip is to buy in if it is an established coin.
For BTC the true dip would be at $100. Then you could ride it up to whatever. 
Since it is a dip on only a $5700 level, you may never see 10x.
BUT you can still wake up the next morning and learn it went down to $1000 or even lower.
@_date: 2018-02-06 09:14:17

Best case scenario would be, where we could simply trade BTC for goods and services instead of fiat altogether.
That way, no gain,.. just pure use of a digital good for a non digital good.
Big FU finger to the banks.
No more middle man.
@_date: 2018-02-14 12:45:33
My point was that is is all relative.

@_date: 2018-02-10 15:11:02
You don't mine Bitcoin using graphics cards as they are far too slow and unprofitable for that.
Nowadays ASIC miners are used. Devices with hundreds of SHA256 crunching chips inside.
You can mine a variety of other cryptos with graphics cards tho.
Then you can change those into Bitcoin if Bitcoin is what you want.
I would mine Ethereum if I were using a GPU card rig. 
And I am not entirely sure it is still profitable since GPU price doubled in the last few months.

It is digital and holds no value on its own.
You just pay for it as much as you think it is worth.
It is no different than an email being sent.
Do they tax email messages?
So if email message would be valued a $1000, I BET YOU that govt would try and tax it.
Not because it makes sense, but because there is money to be made for them.

My point is, that any NORMAL business today simply cannot implement this without a steady stream of BTC/LN customers to stay afloat.
Say a business risks and opens LN payments using BTC and sets 1 week for channels.
In one week BTC can plummet 70%.
How would you be able to operate your business, giving out your products at a loss?
Thankfully BTC processing and fees are normalized now and there is not much need for LN. 
10 minutes wait is still better than 1 day or more for LN network channel.
No risk vs. big risk.
I know BTC price won't change much in 10 minutes.
In one day or 7, it will DEFINITELY change a lot.
@_date: 2018-02-14 13:19:08

Pressure on banks from the banking cartels.
Please expect this, going forward and find alternate means.
@_date: 2018-02-02 19:58:11
It may have begun this way, when it was the only one,.. the first one,.. the king (which it still is).
But later there came much more useful trading coins for spending if that is what you are looking for in crypto.
Gen 1 - 3... onwards. Only gets complicated.
Now with Lightning, you can start using BTC for spending again. Just open them damn channels you fucks.
@_date: 2018-02-22 15:31:25
That is logical and self evident.
Now, WHY people sell at those prices, and in such volume,.. THAT is the question we want answered.
Can be FUD, can be regulation, can be whale manipulation.... plenty of things.
When you have the answer, it is no less impressive than having a magic crystal ball.
Until then, no need to talk.
@_date: 2018-02-14 10:28:42
Could very well go any way.
Problem is you can't predict this by simply drawing it on a chart.
You must analyze the broader world market and political theater in order to even have a possible glimpse, let alone any kind of guarantee of the movement vector.
You will be more accurate by analyzing google trends, and social happenings.
More people adopting BTC = better BTC price.
People living BTC due to FUD or other reasons = worse the BTC price.
Simple [trend]( correlation.

There simply is not enough people/customers to even use BTC this way (yet).

Just what would be the incentive for miners then?
If the difficulty does not increase, coins will be made by the strongest pool out there 24/7 and most miners won't get anything. 
Also, since more miners join every day, this would all become a farce.
@_date: 2018-02-10 14:31:27
To make transactions instant (not just faster) and of course cheaper.
If you open a LN channel to your favorite store or a coffee shop for example, you could do business instantly without any fees.
THAT was the goal at least.
Now the network must spread and programmers just need to make the adoption a lot smoother and much easier for any business that wants to adopt BTC as a means of payment.
SO a shop would for example need to first have an Exchange account, a BTC wallet address and of course a LN node.
What programmers need to do is to create a nice single setup package which a business owner runs and installs on their server or PC workstation, where everything is nicely set up for him.
Then they need to adopt their cashier software on their cash registers and mobile devices.
If someone could make a single all-in-one easy adoption package like that, businesses would have no trouble adopting it.
This however would only be adopted if it is proven to be secure, and backed by some standards.
We are still far away from that, since the standards are not written and regulation is not in place.

My point is, that this is not a guarantee, and depending on the distance the signal may be lost in background noise or degrade or use unfamiliar modulation (if any).
And they most certainly developed technology which communicated faster than the speed of light.
We still don't have a clue how quantum entanglement works over long distances.
Ow we know it works and we can make it work. But we completely fail to understand the fundamental principles.
Suppose these aliens discovered this without using any EM for communication and they went straight into quantum/dimensional communication. We would not detect them.
All we have is bunch of assumptions and we base our whole premise on that.
THIS is what bothers me.
@_date: 2018-02-24 17:28:44
It is only natural.
Credit is a very delicate matter for banks.
If you can not pay up your credit, they have to take the flesh from somewhere.
Having your house as a collateral might do, or even your kidney in a pinch,.. but crypto? Too damn volatile for them to loan you money.
With credit, there have to be some bold assurances and a line they can't cross.
Expect every major bank or anyone dealing with credit or loaning money, to ban crypto purchases.
@_date: 2018-02-13 10:41:29
It is never wise to buy crypto if you are not prepared to loose 100% of what you put in.
It is as simple as this.
No one has a magic crystal ball, so they can not offer a better advice than this.

Just be prepared to lose what you put in. Simple.

Why go into such risk when there is abso-fucking-lutely is no need for it?
Will the business get more customers?
Certainly not.
What then? Just to try this experiment on a hunch?
If you are selling shit for fiat just fine, why take a 70%+ risk?
And we need adoption. I am just saying that in order to jumpstart this, there needs to be a solution which will be easy to transition over to LN/BTC.
A bridge, no one built yet. A vendor/business friendly solution that is risk free.
Hell, even if that was possible, we would see abysmal adoption.

That my friend, is a pipe dream.
Different governments can't even agree on the simplest and most logical notions, let alone on a global Universal Income.
That would only be possible if we had a global government with an AI central computer INSTEAD of politicians.
Maybe 200 years down the road if we are lucky.
But for now, the chaos and politicians, are here stay.
I am not saying that a perfect utopia system can't be created, because it certainly can. But there is no will and there are far too chaotic political instabilities in the world for that to happen.
We have more than enough food and power to make every earthling live like a king, but the reality is that a top greedy 1% owns 99% of worlds wealth and resources.
I think that human nature itself would need to change to bring about the utopia.
Probably some natural disaster which would bring us together,... maybe an alien attack would do the job, but that would be worse than a natural disaster since we can not hope to match their technology at all....

See, this is where you are wrong.
We can't even do a peaceful rally without the government fucking us over in 1 day flat. 
Uprising? Revolution? How many are you willing to sacrifice? What are you prepared to do?
People in a group are no more than easily controllable sheep.
And the governments across all the world have the means and the will to either control, disperse and/or kill the sheep, in large numbers.
There are small revolutions taking place every day in the middle east, because people there really have nothing to loose.
They are quickly done away with by any regime or government in place there.
Sure, you don't hear it on CNN, but the struggle is happening every day and people are dying because of it 24/7.
It is said, that MOST people are willing to do a revolution as long as it does not interfere with their football match and a pint of beer in the evening.
1st world country populace is still far away from doing any revolt against fascist governments they are enjoying their white picket fence lives under.
Look at the US for example. It is a fascist state, not a democracy. Pure fact.
Yet people are still enjoying their mid-class lives, their hot dogs and various games, they take their daughters to dance practice every Wednesday, they play their video games and go out with their friends, they take their families to dinner....
You get my point.
They are complacent. They hate and love their life at the same time, but are too lazy and can not be bothered to come together for an ideal that would benefit others.
I call it human nature at its worst in the best surroundings.
Like I said previously, you can only bend human nature to change slightly if you introduce a common strife, a global disaster, something of immense magnitude that gets at least 1 billion killed (if not more).
There is no other way presently. No ideal or precedent is strong enough, to get most of us across the line to utopia. Most need to die for that to happen.

As long as people believe in crypto, it can act as store of value.

It will never get mined.
The closer to 21 we get the more the difficulty will rise and less of coins the miners will get.

New people who joined the craze are some small part of that equation, but I agree, the meteoric rise can be ascribed to something else.
BUT you have to admit, it would be much easier to do a pump and dump on any other coin in the ecosystem than already expensive Bitcoin which was at around $10k when this started happening.
The only right answer is that it was a contribution of multiple factors, not just what you think is obvious.

As soon as you demand your hard earned money from them OR the banks, they will do anything in their power to come up with some excuse to get rid of you.
Since that money is long gone, used in their hedges that went belly up.
Like a bank uses your money to do other things with it which brings them even more money,... same thing here.
It is hard to find any reputable Exchange today, since they all play the same game. They use the funds of the investors to play dangerous games. And when the crypto falls, suddenly they are left with empty coffers and plenty of those investors calling them to return their cash, this way or the other. They can't, since the coffers are empty or funds are otherwise tied up.

Say you set your coffee price in BTC.
You have to look at exchange rate, and charge your customer that amount based on how much USD you get for certain amount of BTC.
Once the channel closes, the agreed upon BTC will definitely not reflect the price you set when you looked at the exchange previously.
So until the channel is closed I can not be sure what my loss/profit (if any) was.
If BTC goes down or up.
I can gamble on the time I keep the channel open and hope the price did not change much.

There are no bull traps.
Market can reverse at any given point, up or down. And that is not based on drawing up some lines or seeing a fucking pattern. Humans can see patterns all around us,... in the clouds, then fancy up elaborate stories around that.

Nobody is talking about that, here.
It is a fucking ledger. Of course you can track bitcoin go from one address to another.
We are talking about the exchanges. 
If there was an exchange that exchanged fiat for BTC and would obfuscate the bank trail and would not require verification, no one would know who got paid. only obfuscated and hopefully decentralized database of anonymous bank accounts.
You can open anonymous bank account for SEPA transfers online if you didn't know. Some banks respect the anonymity of their customers and it is legal in SOME countries.

No, the LN protocol is self regulating and dynamic.

I am not sure how you manage to sell anything.
You can buy a large (several sq. meter) sheet, then laser cut them easily in 3 hours.
And since laser cutting cost is calculated in time and complexity, it would cost you next to nothing per piece.
You can even use waterjet, which is even cheaper if you really wanted to.
I had many things cut using various methods over the years. The most cost would be the cost of titanium sheet/plate. And like I said, I would replace that with carbon steel or similar (non-corrosive treated metal) instead of titanium.

Just LOL.
Gold is way more stable. You can't even compare the two. Like AT ALL.
But I agree, that BTC on a nice way of becoming a good store of value. And it is that compared to other alt coins.
Also, there are shit ton of other 4th gen alt coins out there that are far more technologically advanced and appropriate for use.
The only thing that makes BTC more stable is its large market cap, as it can absorb fluctuations much more easily. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:35:34

They can't ban virtual data which acts as exchange item.
They would have to ban all game tokens everywhere if this was the case.
They will make it hard to exchange for fiat currency I suspect.
Which will play into our hand the moment merchants decide to trade their services for BTC. And this will alienate people even more from fiat.
Since it works, securely and above all else TRANSPARENTLY, with 100% back log due to ledger.
Banks don't have that. Governments don't have that.

As you see, it has fallen considerably since your hunch and it is still not showing any improvement.

Could be one person buying BTC to buy a yacht or a house from another BTC friend or business.
BTC is being traded in high circles.
Sometimes because they loose a bet, or simply don't want fiat paper trail on their bank sheets that they sold an item or two.

In crypto, the general rule of thumb is "If it looks too good to be true, it definitely is". Comes back biting you in the ass as soon as larger sum of money is involved and when it comes to payout.
@_date: 2018-02-04 17:01:47
As a business, you need to register your exchange company.
And as that, you are required to follow regulation.
There can be no illegal exchanges because as soon as you make whatever little money, they want their cut (tax).
This is how governments work.
If you do not give them your cut, they brand you as illegal and take your ass down.
Why on earth do you think we have a dark web?
Also the second main reason why you need to register is, that governments need to know where the money goes.
So there can be no anonymous money laundering.
And no anonymous profiteering avoiding taxes.

I agree, Bitcoin is only workh as much as people believe it to be worth.
Some believe it to be worth $1 million while others believe it to be worth $0.
So here we are, arguing about something neither of us has control over.
Ponder famous Warren Buffer quote or two:
*Attempt to be fearful when others are greedy and to be greedy only when others are fearful.*
*Price is what you pay. Value is what you get.*
Buy when FUD is at maximum and price is highest and sell when everyone is happy and price is high. Simple rule to live by and it works.

Gold,.. if you buy it on the market, it is virtual.

Fiat money has special characteristics that are FAR removed from what Bitcoin is.
Go to wikipedia and learn a thing or two.
They can confiscate gold from you, they can confiscate fiat from you.... they can't do the same with your bitcoin.
Also you will have a hard time transporting 1 million in gold or fiat across border and on the streets.

I am sure some notorious bad apples are deeply thinking what can be done to extract as much as possible out of this "novelty".
LN IS nothing more than a novelty right now. It will not be for long, though.
And looking forward, some plots and strategies are being thought over.
In the end, because of the very nature of the LN network protocol, there really is not much they can do. No strategy will work as the network keeps expanding.
You can totally compare it with TOR network.
See what can be learned from that and then you can apply some parallels to LN network, with an unpredictable twist.

There are coins produced every day and many don't touch any exchange.
Yet they (old and new), are all very traceable.
They can trace any coin in existence. Such is the blockchain.
You can't have some covert coins that are not possible to be tracked. It is simply not possible.
What you meant was probably the wallet address?
Some are red flagged by the authorities and coins from there are tracked as a matter of course. Whichever wallet they touch.
Then if a coin from a red flagged wallet hits the exchange, they pay special attention to whom it was sold. Because in order to be on exchange, you must give them your personal identity (yeah the law has exchanges by the balls). Regulations and all that, you understand? Money laundering is a huge thing.
So if you have an unused wallet with some coins on it, it is just that. A normal wallet. 
Not worth any more or any less than any other legal wallet out there.
Illegal activity and red flagged tracked wallet addresses are a minority. They only monitor BTC moving in and out of them and wherever they end up and who buys that BTC.

You can simply use bitcoin for purchases.
THIS is what these banksters want to prevent.
Once people start using bitcoin for trade instead of fiat currency, it is all over for them.
Naturally most grocery chains will not trade in anything but fiat, but there are plenty of shops that are growing. From tech stores, car stores, real estate all the way down to coffee.
The more businesses allow for crypto purchases the higher the price of crypto will become and the less relevant fiat will become.
1 bitcoin is 1 bitcoin, same as 1 dollar is 1 dollar.
What you get for each is dependent on adoption and ability to use it in every day life.
Right now the exchanges are essential if you need to exchange your crypto for fiat. If you need crypto for your every day life.
The big issue among BTC adopters is that they only went into crypto world with intent to earn proffits. 
This is the single wrong and fucked up thing.
It caused a lot of the issues we observe today.
Instead, crypto should have been used for trade. My crypto for your item etc.. 
Not your crypto for fiat, then fiat for my item.
This needs to change. And it is changing slowly.

For me, there is still too many unanswered questions.
There would have to be an instructional video showcasing one use case in its entirety by the numbers and in numbers.
None of that idealistic philosophical bullcrap we are currently getting on self-proclaimed "LN explanation videos".
Something actual, step by step, which you can show to a vendor, grocer, business owner in such a way he will understand and see the benefit and also pitfalls.
This is sorely needed and not a single video yet was done which would do it like this.
Business owners are used to work with various accounting tools, and they can understand the underlying ideas, but how this was done in practice (a real use case) is nowhere to be seen.
You know, from the company server, to the cashier workstation, down to the damn POS machine used to transact with persons mobile device and to the receipt and then back to the server, to the exchange, to the account.
Step by fucking step.

It was an idea, that gave birth to all the alt coins we have now.
So I must say it was a resounding success.
Since Bitcoins are limited by number, its price naturally fluctuates based on how much money comes in and goes out of the bitcoin ecosystem.
The more people will buy into it and use it, the higher it will go.
BUT that does not mean other altcoins are to be ignored.
They have their role to play. Some more than others.
We had some really nice advances in decentralization, anonymity, smart contracts and such. So the crypto sector is only bound to flourish.
If you still have some cryptos, never ever ever sell them under what you paid. Ever.
And if you want profit, all you have to do is wait, since slowly but surely, cryptos will rise more and more over the years, and they will become the norm of how we do business in some sectors.
Have faith. And do not trust in getting rich quick.
I think that era is over. All you can do now, is get some sort of financial security. But not in the short term.
