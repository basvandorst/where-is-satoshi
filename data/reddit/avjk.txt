I'm feeling good. Will probably buy some later this month if the price doesn't rise back before i get more fiat. I think this "bloodbath" is actually very healthy considering what an insane bull market we've had for a long time. There will always be ups and downs in any asset's price that is freely determined by supply and demand.

Whether something is worth investing doesn't depend on the amount being invested. If your $10 investment becomes worth of $15 it was more worth than keeping it in dollars.

It's what keeps the exchange prices similar

Never sell everything if you believe in btc. Just balance your portfolio / take some gains when you can't handle the risk anymore. (also set a predefined btc price for that)

I would sell enough to be able to live off of traditional investments. For example some s&amp;p 500 etf or similar. The rest I'd keep in crypto but I'd diversify at least a little bit into eth and others.
