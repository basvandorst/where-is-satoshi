Wait, won't you just own a share of the etf though? I thought it was more indirect, like you can't actually access the coins that are associated with money you put into the etf? Same way if I buy shares of milk in the MOO etf, I don't get to go pick up a bunch of milk from the approved parties who handle the backend trading of the etf.

How does the network guarantee that identical addresses are not created if you can create a new address offline? Is it just mathematically just very unlikely?

Interesting how linear the volume growth is when you set the graph to USD but is much less predictable when set to BTC.
Can you clarify what you mean by "growth of N%" ?

Except Bitcoin is already going through updates on chain. Wouldn't that arguably be a subtler diversion from Bitcoin's original format? For the sake of honest and productive conversation I don't see how using words like "schemes" or "hijacking" is useful. If it really is a baseless scheme, just sit back, relax, and watch as it promptly fails. Otherwise, provide useful supporting arguments to make a point rather than just say they are scheming. I'm neutral in the sense that I really just want to see how both sides play out, but both sides are pretty silly about name calling. Good work speaks for itself and beats the competition on capability, so as a interested observer this should be a fun couple of weeks.

Does Newegg vary the price slightly between buyers for any given item to keep track of who to send the item to?

What improvements did bch roll back (other than segwit)? I thought they just raised the blocksize

Seems silly they don't have it in BTC but they have USD

Is there a way to see number of bitcoin transacted per day rather than number of transactions per day?
