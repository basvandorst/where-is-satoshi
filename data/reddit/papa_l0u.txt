Australian checking in here. You most definitely can use coinbase in Aus. Coinspot is a good alternative though

First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you and then you win

Bitcoin maybe go up, Bitcoin maybe go down.

Good morning Bitcoinland :)
@_date: 2019-11-14 07:43:08
To all you weak hands, please keep selling. I'd love to buy your BTC at a discounted price
@_date: 2019-11-13 12:28:23
Lower fees

@_date: 2019-11-02 14:25:12
Thanks but the site won't load for me. Anyone else having this issue?
@_date: 2019-11-02 07:11:21
If everyone buys and no one sells we moon. Simples.
@_date: 2019-11-16 02:27:43
Thanks mate i actually live in Melbourne so I'm quite familiar with the ol VB, however i was asking about vB which in this context is quite different
@_date: 2019-11-09 14:27:53
Why would you want to do such a thing?
@_date: 2019-11-08 09:15:00
Never sell btc for fiat unless you absolutely have to. Many in the past have regretted doing so
@_date: 2019-11-02 07:20:46
How do you guys find these numbers?
@_date: 2019-11-11 07:22:35
Lmao I've heard that one before
@_date: 2019-11-11 07:13:43
Aaaaand we're back under 9000
Edit: Why are you booing me I'm right
@_date: 2019-11-16 00:44:58
Care to explain what a vB is for a Bitcoin dummy like me?
@_date: 2019-11-09 07:50:41
Buy the dip
@_date: 2019-11-11 13:38:26
*Bitcoin quadruples in 7 months*
"We never left the bear market" 
Makes sense to me
@_date: 2019-11-09 13:15:44
Use coingecko its better anyways
@_date: 2019-08-21 06:15:42
Thanks guys, just bought the dip!
@_date: 2019-08-21 03:41:12
I have a ledger so I'm looking to withdraw it as soon as it hits my exchange wallet! What are the withdrawal fees for Coinjar like?
@_date: 2019-10-15 11:18:41
As a fellow Australian, yes. BTCmarkets.net is what i use as it has the lowest fees, although some people prefer Coinspot. Buy a hardware wallet if you're looking to invest any serious money though :)
@_date: 2019-10-30 11:58:57
Im no Bitcoin, but i would also gladly take landlord.
@_date: 2019-08-21 13:29:01
Ah yes the inevitable dip after the dip
@_date: 2019-10-30 14:47:18
I'll be able to tell my grandkids one day that an internet stranger gave me enough sats for a months rent over a silly reddit comment. Thanks u/FresnoStateDean!
@_date: 2019-10-23 16:04:35
And then when it hits 3k wait until it goes to 1k
@_date: 2019-08-21 06:21:56
@_date: 2019-10-30 11:58:27
Go back to 4chan
@_date: 2019-08-21 03:28:17
@_date: 2018-06-25 07:34:45
Who knows
@_date: 2019-08-21 05:35:51
What's your re-entry target? What if it doesn't go below 10k again?
@_date: 2019-10-15 11:23:11
At fees of 1 sat/byte though?
@_date: 2019-10-28 18:24:45
Either yes or no
@_date: 2019-10-30 11:35:07
@_date: 2019-10-15 11:21:19
Buying? Yes. Mining? No. Watch a few Andreas Antonopolous videos on youtube so you actually know what you're buying into.
@_date: 2019-10-30 01:08:11
Multisig wallets ez fix
@_date: 2019-06-26 16:29:06
Is this an actual satoshi quote? Wouldn't mind reading some more satoshi stuff

@_date: 2019-10-28 07:50:40
Good morning Bitcoinland :)
@_date: 2019-10-29 02:58:07
How on earth did you even come to this conclusion in the first place? It's called a halving not a doubling
@_date: 2019-09-26 11:42:51
G'day fellow Aussie. How have you set up a SMSF? im only 20 and have barely anything in my super but i'd definitely be interested in setting that up myself. Essentially a DCA into bitcoin without having to touch anything.
@_date: 2019-09-26 11:53:41
Cheers thanks mate
@_date: 2019-09-22 17:43:40
For now
