I can't take an article seriously when it's author uses phrases like "120k sounds like allot more"

The quote for those too lazy to click:


Doesn't really sound like he's saying anything about Bitcoin as a reserve currency specifically but I guess they've got to get clicks somehow.

I'm starting to worry about the possibility of this never happening. These aren't the type of people that will change their minds, they've already decided that bitcoin is not worth their time and it would take a terrific amount of evidence to convince them otherwise. I believe that once they have decided, they would take on the mindset that everybody else is wrong before putting the blame on themselves. I think we need to put more effort as a community to make good first impressions on people, make sure bitcoin appears in the mainstream media in a positive light, because if you see article after article about bitcoin markets getting shut down, you're not going to want to join in.

Inflation is pretty universally recognized as a good thing (in reasonable amounts) among economists. The suggestion that a deflationary asset should be used as a ubiquitous currency is a bit absurd.
Doesn't mean Bitcoin isn't an excellent thing, but it's certainly no US dollar.

This is very important, and OP admitting he had any bitcoin after saying he didn't was a bad idea, because then they know you've lied to them.

If they got rid of several bitcoins for no reason at all, they probably didn't know enough about bitcoin to know that they could do that.

That depends on how much the mistake was worth.

Funny thing about, decreasing supply in this market by taking out marketplaces increases price without having too much of an effect on quantity demanded, which causes the amount of money in the drug market to skyrocket. So going after suppliers to try to stop drug marketplaces from being popular is laughably counterproductive.

Anybody who's taken a middle school science course should know of the metric system, even in America. That said, i'm not sure why so many people don't know how it works.

Not if you just sold and want the price to go down before you buy more.
@_date: 2016-06-17 06:27:14
I was worried there wouldn't be a good time to buy more, but now is a perfect time to buy!

Banks benefit from lending money to people. If less people want to borrow money, then the bank makes less money.

It doesn't matter why the merchants don't give the discount though; the fact of the matter is that they don't give one. On the customer end, this means that paying with a credit card ends up costing less.

Meanwhile someone else is accidentally sending a $0.05 transaction with a 140 coin fee instead of the other way around. Who is addressing these problems?

I think Wikipedia keeps version history where you can just go look at what any article used to say. 
@_date: 2018-04-18 16:21:58
Just because something is divisible doesn't mean it isn't scarce. You gave examples of gold and oil. Why can't I just cut a gold bar in half and sell that? What's to stop me from cutting it in half again and again?
How about oil? We may measure the price of oil in entire barrels just as we measure the price of bitcoin in entire coins, but that doesn't mean either of them aren't scarce.
You could even make an argument that at any time we could find more oil in the ground, which would unexpectedly increase the supply. Nobody's going to be digging up more bitcoin.

I'm not a lawyer, but I believe you're correct.
As I understand it, gains remain unrealized until you sell for cash.

The collapse of the Soviet Union wasn't anywhere close to as big of a deal as the hypothetical collapse of the United States government would be. I don't think you realize just how huge the role of the United States is in the global economy.

Capital gains are only taxed when they are 'realized.'
This means that you don't have to pay taxes on any of your crypto until you sell it. If you buy a bitcoin at $10k and sell it in a year at $15k, you've got to pay capital gains tax on that $5k that you made. If you never sell your coin, then you've never got to pay capital gains tax.

That depends on what you see the purpose of gold and oil as. If you're looking at these commodities as a store of value, then it doesn't matter how small the proportions get, they still function exactly the same. That's the way any sort of store of value works, even the USD can be split up into pennies.
@_date: 2015-10-27 19:51:38

I thought it already was confirmed.
Anyway, if you're only looking judging your investments by what they will do in the next few days, you shouldn't be investing. Look at what bitcoin has done in a year, or even a month, it's managed to stay on it's feet and I doubt that any news from China could crash the market beyond recovery.

It looks like this site only lets you purchase up to $5 of BTC and charges a $2 fee regardless of how much you purchase. A 40% fee is hardly low.
