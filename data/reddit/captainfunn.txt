This analogy assumes 1 or 2 people are in control of everything. I'm not sure it would work on if a lot of people are in control.

When you export from Elelctrum you get like 50 private keys and addresses. You need to check each one and only some of them have coins in them. I used this method to get the forked coins and it worked. I used a site that can check multiple addresses in one go so I didn't need to check each one by hand and then sweeped them in the Coinomi android app.

Sweeping is for every private key. For example if you export your Electrum private keys you can sweep them somewhere else.

You can't know when it'll happen. Probably when you won't expect it. If everyone knows it's a bubble it will be harder to burst. In a burst event the price could go just sideways, not down.
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:10:43
Export the private keys an sweep them back in the new version.

I needed to google this one.

What if the number of bitcoins decreases even more because people loose their private keys, especially the non tecnical ones.
This would drive the price up even more I think.

If you hold 0.2 BTC until 2020-2024 that amount could be worth $300000.

Lol. This post sounds only just like an ad for the recover tool.
Edit: you can use Hashcat to decrypt the wallet password too. And it's free.

When we hit 100,000 there will probably spread news that china invented a quantum computer that can crack bitcoin, and then will crash to 60,000, and the cycle repeats.

If you do the math 2014/2015 it goes to 2960.

Even if it goes to 4400 is just a pretty normal day in crypto.

Would be better to write just the seed words or the private key from a paper wallet.

When you are new to bitcoin you'll see dips as crashes. When you understand it you just see it as an opportunity to get richer.

All the exchanges have a chance, Coinbase, Bitstamp, Kraken, ... but they need to get their shit together and make it simple and fast for the end user or someone else will come and take over.

Seems pretty accurate, but will probably be in a range between 6250-6500.
@_date: 2018-12-11 20:08:08
Yes. It levels out in ~2040 at 850k$. I guess we'll never see 1 million bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-12-12 06:52:50
These are not elliot waves. Make the chart linear to draw elliot waves. The log chart shows the "rate of growth" in percentages and not some linear price action.

So you'll go short and become filthy rich?
@_date: 2018-12-11 18:52:33
My magic charting shows between 55-88k. Depends where the current bottom is.
@_date: 2018-12-15 18:28:46
From my calcs 88k.
@_date: 2018-12-11 19:55:26
I don't think it applies to the rate of growth, like it's displayed in the log charts.
@_date: 2018-12-12 07:34:26
About 50-90k is more probable. From my magic charting 88k is the exact target, but can easily change.
@_date: 2018-12-11 19:15:52
If you follow the pattern of the peaks you see it'll stabilize at 850k$ but in 40+ years time.
@_date: 2018-12-17 19:11:36
@_date: 2018-12-11 19:00:57
When the price went from 5-10$ it was a 100% increase, when it went from 10000-20000$ it was also a 100% increase. This chart just makes you see this relationships better.
@_date: 2018-12-12 07:40:34
You sure? You think there will still be sellers pressure at such low prices? Anybody that wanted to sell would have already sold by then.

It seems that the style difference dates back to the 18th-century Europe when the dot became popular as a symbol for multiplication. To avoid confusing the decimal separator with the multiplication sign, most European countries adopted the comma as a decimal separator. However, at the time, in the UK, the X was the popular symbol for multiplication, so British mathematicians continued to use the period as a decimal point.
