People say that cryptocurrency has the signs of a bubble and expect it to crash like the original tech bubble, but I think it's a bad comparison. That's not to say that there isn't a bubble happening right now, but it's not where skeptics say it is. 
Back in the 90's, that original tech bubble was created by a change in institutional standards for taking companies public that resulted in companies going public with no established profitability or honestly reason for existence. Those taking them public often didn't care, largely because of the proliferation of illegal market manipulation that would let them pump a stock's initial valuation and then get out.
That should sound familiar, because that is the landscape for ICOs right now. It's a minefield of fraud and half-baked ideas, many of which somehow still garner interest. Now *that* is where I think the bubble is, and where we'll see an impact once things pop. Either regulation or disaster (or both) is going to make it much harder to get interest in a new coin.
But cryptocurrency on the whole? That's the technology, like the computer. The tech bubble bursting hit tech industry businesses, not the computer itself. So this bubble will pop, the shitcoins will die, the rest will take a hit, and then it'll level out. Just like before.

The stock value isn't guaranteed. Having a stable foundation means that you won't end up in a situation where you have to sell at an inopportune time to cover an expense. It allows you to be strategic.

Ah, I getcha. I think that's fair. There is still the risk of another 2008 happening, but the risk is small enough that it's worth the return.
