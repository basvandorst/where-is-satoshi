what ? Why would everyone try the same nonce when you know it won't work ?
@_date: 2018-01-01 04:29:40
What about it ?
@_date: 2018-01-09 06:53:32
when we mean disappearing , we normally mean new transactions getting resolved without reaching the chain . 
@_date: 2018-01-09 15:34:50
Lightning does not happen in a instant . 
Look at how long it is taking to activate segwit wallets . It even depends on the adoption. I am guessing atleast 1 year 
@_date: 2018-01-01 05:50:53
Is it running on ethereum ?
@_date: 2018-01-29 17:42:14
Do the miners iterate for the nonce, or do they go for random numbers ?
I was thinking if they go for random numbers, how does pool make sure, all the members are mining different nonces

Hey, you have that post link how to setup the test lightning wallet in testnet . I want to open a node and just check it
@_date: 2018-01-09 14:04:02
Not if it doubles in 1 month
@_date: 2018-01-09 04:33:26
Hello hero , uncomfirmed transactions are not going to disappear all of a sudden . The transactions which are sent to the chain should all be processed by the chain . 
It is going to be a slow process. Don't expect 1 day change.
@_date: 2018-01-21 13:54:53
Wait a minute , are we supposed to move the coins from a non segwit wallet to other . I use electrum and did not do any of that stuff , and my receiving address is segwit one .
@_date: 2018-01-01 12:44:40
why should the individual wallets be having a block chain. It is a fucking overkill . Isn't it?
@_date: 2018-01-01 06:45:09


How the fuck did they code this thing ?
your review looks like the review of nucleus in silicon valley sitcom
@_date: 2018-01-09 15:30:40
What mega thread ?
@_date: 2018-01-01 07:07:26
how does the verification of transactions happen ? Is it similar to how iota works ?
@_date: 2018-01-02 14:21:08
I would like to take a moment to thank this guy. I fucking knew about bitcoin for around 2 years and never bought it . 
Somehow this guy convinced me to research more and buy Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-09 06:54:54
You can try with the test net. Hope this helps .
@_date: 2018-01-03 16:51:29
There was a post inside my office intranet where someone was selling gpu's. I guy offered him 2 bitcoins at 250 usd each . 
The seller did not take the offer .
@_date: 2018-01-21 15:57:32
sry, I wasn't clear.
I thought the segwit upgrade is normally how you construct a transaction and not dependent on your address . So moving your funds from a non segwit wallet to a segwit wallet may be unnecessary .
I may be wrong though .
@_date: 2017-12-26 13:11:35
There is no way I am using it if I may get my payment on probability. It may end me never getting the payment.

If we are doing sub satoshi transactions and rounding up, shit is bound to happen someday
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:38:36
Dollar averaging , start buying from small amounts
@_date: 2017-12-26 17:21:46
how do we aggregate if the total transactions happened are less than satoshi.
@_date: 2017-12-26 11:40:43
I am not rich enough to spam the network. Just asking out of curiosity.
@_date: 2017-12-25 16:33:10
And never going to revisit
@_date: 2017-12-27 03:40:05
Then what happened to it ?

Isn't the bech32 address supposed to have "-" ?

If 51% of btc network goes on to attack bch network , then btc network will be vulnerable for 51% attack right ?
@_date: 2017-12-26 17:45:31
I wanted to do this for my office's secret santa, but the transaction fees is too high for this to happen . 
@_date: 2017-12-30 20:12:02
If there is only one signature for multiple inputs , is it possible for others to verify the transaction after the block is built ?
I have no ides how those signatures work !!!
@_date: 2017-12-29 02:50:29
Keywords ? Did you write them down ?
@_date: 2017-12-23 14:32:48
Now you know what coins they are holding.
@_date: 2017-12-29 02:38:52
Man with a plan
@_date: 2017-12-26 17:39:26
One of the reason we are going for lightning is because we want to do **small transactions** and many transactions without hitting the chain . If are doing sub satoshi transactions and rounding up to 1 satoshi, people are bound to loose some money .
@_date: 2017-12-26 12:37:55
ok, I wasn't joking .I was just noob .
Did not see the chart. But i doubt miners would waste the hashing power to kill the other chain when they could earn the money mining . 
And I doubt it is going to happen. We never saw ethereum miners trying to kill eth classic chain .
@_date: 2017-12-27 05:25:40


looks like bitfinexed and team.
I am not comparing, but he/she is pretty calm from the past 10 days. Hope he is safe
@_date: 2017-12-26 17:42:39
not if 1 btc = 10^7 usd. For every satoshi in a channel you will be losing one dollar . 
@_date: 2017-12-27 06:25:36
why is there no news about it anywhere ?
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:33:19
Browse for a hour on r/Bitcoin, you will think bitcoin cash is trash . 
Browse for a hour on r/btc ,you will think bitcoin core is trash .

yes. What you say feels true, But did you ever wonder how does gold or silver get its value. Who decided a gold of 1 kg has more value than a salt of 1 kg. 
Yes, once people start mass selling  it will fall pretty hard. This even happens with the normal stock markets or the gold prices or any other commodity for that matter . 
The one reason we decided to give it value is because of its 21 million limit and the immutability of the block chain.
This can be future and I see a lot of potential to it. Yes , Every time a crash like this happens , we all feel fear and wondering if this is the last day. But , I am willing to wait for at least 10 years to see where this goes. I can't guarantee this thing is going to change the world but it has the potential to do it.
Right now it needs a lot of contributors for it go strong. Support the developers,Learn the tech it is awesome. 
Anyone is free to do whatever they want . Selling for profits is never bad.
May be after 20 years, we will be remembered as the guys who lost a lot of money on crypto. May be this will the bubble that one day young generations will learn from . 
Thank you.
And as always, **Never invest what you can't lose**.

wtf, which fork ?
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:13:03
1 month
@_date: 2017-12-26 10:49:07
Here take it : "private key"
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:40:04
Bcash solves the problems you are saying now . Why not hold bcash ?
You wouldn't say the same when it is going on a bull run from 10k+
@_date: 2017-12-27 05:38:01
so you say, I should not have sold my house and my kidney to buy bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-09-19 04:04:08
Hi, Just seeing the code.
Can you point me where is the CheckTransaction function implemented at ? How do I find it ?
Never Mind, founnd it :  
@_date: 2018-09-19 04:39:54
they are not skipping it . This will call the CheckTransaction function which will check if there are duplicate inputs in the transaction before sending it to the peers .
This check was made run only with a flag which they forgot to set it to true.
afaik, This fix is good enough. 
The exact point where this closes the the node may be at some point in the processing of block after my node receives the transaction.
@_date: 2017-12-27 05:35:11
yes .
Right now, not everyone can sell off bitcoin for the same amount. If around a billion dollars gets sold off, The price falls down to a huge amount . I think that's what he meant by disappearing money. People are ok to sell with loss so that they can avoid more loss, which means their money disappeared .  
@_date: 2018-09-09 05:46:28
0.69 cents
@_date: 2019-02-12 05:08:59
The website says it is a paid program. How much is the fees ?
@_date: 2018-03-12 05:38:29
nope , [these are crackers](
@_date: 2018-02-03 10:11:05
This made me laugh so hard. 
Koinex , India on the other hand pulls the site down for maintenance when ever there is a crash .
@_date: 2018-03-13 08:42:49
The moment I saw that rap **   , I cringed and thought "I need to sell this "
PS: I am not going to sell though
@_date: 2018-02-28 07:12:39
I don't get it. If we just forked off the chain as is, how the fuck did they get to hold more coins ?
@_date: 2018-02-14 17:08:52
what did you add in it for it to be 128 MB ?
@_date: 2018-03-02 10:57:48
In between I saw the strap and thought his tooth came out 
@_date: 2018-02-26 12:30:15
I meant different implementations of the wallets.
wallets by lightning labs, blockstream, ln_zap etc. Do all of them use onion routing ? 
@_date: 2018-03-17 19:54:19
yes, I agree but I don't get why some people are against rbf saying it killed 0-conf transactions
@_date: 2018-02-07 17:19:58
woah! Never knew it was this huge . It seems so stupid on the owner's part .
Edit : Just searched for the ceo name. Is this the guy who is creating stellar ? Why isn't he in prison ?
@_date: 2018-02-07 05:57:37
Is DDOS responsible for mtgox ?
