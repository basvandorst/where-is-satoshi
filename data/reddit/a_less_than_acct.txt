I own almost 70 bitcoin, I'm just a few sats shy. If you want them show up to my house 1600 Pennsylvania Ave in DC. I'll be waiting hombre
@_date: 2019-11-10 19:00:00

Japan holds more American debt than China. We owe ourselves 80% of our debt

Yeah but youll flip bear for months before flipping bear for months.

Verification failed and I couldnt appeal. 
Just sold, got verified on the exchanges instead.
@_date: 2019-08-28 01:59:14
Or the opposite. If money is literally evaporating in front of you there is incentive to move to a currency that will retain some of that value
@_date: 2019-08-29 13:22:01
I spent like 100 bucks on bitcoin in like 2010 and have never once checked the price. 
Are we up to a dollar yet?

Not OP but Ive got a miner at my work...
@_date: 2019-08-29 13:28:30
I read the same thing about 10k a few weeks ago.
@_date: 2019-08-15 17:20:33
Cant flip crypto coins bro
@_date: 2019-08-19 11:30:44
Verification failed, I had more than 10 bucks in there.
From what I saw there was no appeal process so I could buy and sell just not transfer out
@_date: 2019-08-19 02:52:48
I like the cash app but can't use it for bitcoin. Wouldn't let me transfer out to a wallet.
@_date: 2019-08-29 23:29:37

I dont like the dip, take it back and let me speak to the manager.
@_date: 2019-08-30 12:05:39
I am 100% kidding.
@_date: 2019-10-10 02:20:00
But... That requires an initial investment into popcorn
@_date: 2019-10-07 11:35:35
Not forever but a few more decades
@_date: 2019-10-17 02:44:37
I still use cash app but even trying to verify myself twice failed. Forced to exchanges which taught me a lot about crypto
@_date: 2019-08-02 16:44:17
Never underestimate the fury of an IRS scorned.

5201 Bob!
@_date: 2019-09-09 01:18:50
Who is buying thousands of bitcoin in the whole of 2019?
Is it those Facebook twins?
@_date: 2019-09-20 14:38:28
It could go up or down, some analysts are saying it could remain the same however
@_date: 2019-09-27 03:12:47
I'll take 1000.01$ Bob! BIG MONEY!

My landlord, local bar, gym, coffee shop, home depot, pizza shop, chienese place, movie theater, bank, student loans, town office, barber, diner, vending machine don't take bitcoin
@_date: 2019-09-27 03:06:43
I hate these comments. You're too comfortable. You realize the best idea, the best tech doesn't always win? Betamax was a better technology then VHS and it lost. Edison almost killed AC, arguably the foundation of modern society. 
Humans aren't sensible. Don't expect bitcoin to win just because it makes no sense for it not to. Humans routinely do things against their best interests this isn't any different
@_date: 2019-09-11 12:50:58
I mean ill take a deaf hooker.
@_date: 2019-09-27 02:41:40

I've got 80% hodled and I play with the rest.

Why dont you just ask your parents for more in your trust fund? That's how I was able to invest in internet money
@_date: 2019-09-03 11:25:37

I kinda like my bank, I go to a credit union. All the people know me and I have a car loan through them
I definitely invest in bitcoin but my local bank isnt bad.
@_date: 2019-09-09 01:33:53
I mean that's not unreasonable, any ideas on return?
@_date: 2019-09-27 02:33:53
Aw shit I got some xrp... Do you think btc is the only crypto? I'm like 75% btc 25% xrp
@_date: 2019-09-08 13:24:17
I would arm yourself with a little research but from my understanding bitcoin can be quantum proof
@_date: 2019-09-27 03:10:14
I know this is the bitcoin sub but I'm being honest. I think there is a niche for a crypto solution to banks and financial institutions exchanging money and if xrp does fill that niche then it's a good investment.
Again I'm mostly bitcoin and support it completely.
