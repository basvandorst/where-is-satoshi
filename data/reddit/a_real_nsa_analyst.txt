That's great. So what pools are Good? I heard slush and bitpool are decent. What if I wanted to solo mine? Is there any benefits to going solo?

The S9 looks like a beast! I could definitely get a few of these and write them off for tax purposes :)

I was looking at a couple of s5+s or are those too outdated to start with?
@_date: 2017-12-24 17:00:52
Thanks! I'll be sure to keep you all updated.
@_date: 2017-12-24 15:37:23
Wasn't sure about that either and was about to ask. Thanks for anticipating my next question!

Is it paying off for you? How long have you been mining? Do you have any donts that you may share on your experience?

I have no limit on power or bandwidth. I have a contract that gives me access to as much as I need at no additional cost. Unless I spin up new racks.

Thank you. You have been extremely helpful. I'll definitely take a look at these. I have checked my contract and there is no additional charges :) I have a large contact with them.

I'm already spending money. Starting a hosting company is not cheap.

I figured. But having the ability to purchase hardware based on my business and get the write off helps a little. But I do understand how it could turn out. Is there any trusted sources to buy the s9 from?
@_date: 2017-12-24 15:39:11
I'll get a couple of them. What about software?
@_date: 2017-12-24 15:59:42
Thanks for the info. Do you currently mine?
