Who cares whether the banks look favourably on it? It's each person's money and the banks are our customers, not the other way around!

This is a very good reason to close a Nationwide account.

Sounds like a sketchy situation not having your seeds. I would move the BTC to another wallet asap.

Every cloud has a silver lining...

That's the exact problem. Nobody is going to fix the fee issue because the percentage is so small. That doesn't make it go away however. It might actually help with the volatility because of the  disincentive  to small frequent trades.

How scared you should be depends entirely on what price you bought in at and whether or not you spent money you can't afford to lose.
Not perhaps very helpful, but very true.

RE 3) volatility. It's only volatile if your mindset is pricing everything in fiat. 1 BTC is worth exactly 1 BTC. Any industry that prices everything from raw materials to sale of end product in BTC will see no volatility in the currency at all.  It's chaotic at the moment because it's straddling fiat and certainly for an industry to adopt BTC in its entirety looks distant now - but I bet it will in time.

Other coins are showing a bounce / hold too.

Price prediction 10,257 on Christmas day.

That's not radical: it's a cartel.

Also be wary of semi pro or pro traders closing out their positions toward the end of the last working week before Christmas. They will probably view the volatility too much to risk leaving funds in unmonitered.

I suppose in some senses the similarity between gold &amp; BTC is that nobody buys anything in gold either. Most probably people only hold gold precisely because of its history and stability. People only hold BTC precisely because of its instability. 
TL;DR - both the same but gold is on the way out and BTC on the way in.

The oscillations are getting smaller and are of a lower amplitude.

Price is suspiciously quiet at the moment...

That's what I mean. If people are selling off coins, the exchange is buying them - they will have a massive net outflow of fiat. No doubt they have large cash reserves, but there must be a limit. Trading would have to halt at some point.

But surely that only makes next year's tax bill worse?

9,009 - 13,080 on New Year's day.
20,000 sometime between Feb 22 April 08 - most likely March 16th.

I wonder if coinbase has run out of fiat cash?

They will have liquidity in fiats &amp; coins, and over the average you are right - they take a cut of every trade. But in a flash crash where everyone offers BTC and wants USD (nobody is selling USD) the liquidity could dry up.

You say that like it's a problem(!)

If it finishes at or above 10100 USD by midnight UTC it will still be on track for 20k USD by February.
