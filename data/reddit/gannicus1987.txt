I know, when i first used BFX, i thaught my money was safe. After the hack obviously i didn't. But i received BFX tokens, so the only thing i could do was to wait to redeem them @ $1, after a couple months needed to do some payments, so had to exchange them for BTC tuesdaynight, the minute the trade was done, somebody had withdrawn my btc. When i checked back to my pc an hour later, my bitcoin was stolen.

There isn't going to be next funds for a while now. Lost a substantial amount in 2 months time.
But i know, i'm never trusting my coins with 3rd party services ever again.

1) Already knew this, just being stupid i guess, gullible...
2) Already knew this with the BFX hack to.

No, he supposedly had access to my PC, and therefore access to my Outlook. He requested a SMS 2FA option for his phone in Israel, from my computer apparantly. 
So whenever he did a withdraw he could have verified it with SMS 2FA. 
I already tried to call the phone number, but with no luck.....

I did! I use "Authy" for authenthication. According to BFX support, the culprit had requested a "SMS 2FA" from my computer, meaning the hacker had access to my computer and outlook. 
So when he made the withdraw, he verified the request with SMS 2FA. 
Like i said i don't understand why BFX didn't flag this behavior, i always log in using a Belgian Ip, but this day somebody requested a "SMS 2FA" option for a phone number in Israel and immediately used it.

I actually run Malwarebytes every week, and it didn't flag anything, i found the virus on my own...But you're right.

So basiccly we could describe it as a soft fork?
