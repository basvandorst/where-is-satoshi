Most BitCoin purchases involved inferior currencies, such as fiat dollars.
That is going to be true until BitCoin overtakes fiat currencies as medium of exchange, and this will happen precipitously.
Don't feel pressured to use BitCoins to pay your dry cleaners. It doesn't matter right now.

The essence of fractional reserve banking is accepting the credit of a bank at face value, i.e. the bank says it owes you a bitcoin and you accept that as being the same as having a bitcoin. A bank debt becomes money (inflation).
The scheme works as long as the bank's credit is good. If its credit is in doubt, a bank run takes place. Its debt is no longer money (deflation).
The fraud involved in fractional reserve banking is when banks used depositor's money to pay off loans, thus expropriating depositors. That doesn't really work with bitcoin since deposits are held in the network, not a bank.

Because of the division of knowledge (see Hayek), the vast majority of people do not understand the vast majority of things. What they will believe is long-term value.
This is why there is a historic (not a once-in-a-lifetime, but historic) opportunity for people who do understand economics and computer science to make a fortune as the early adopters of system that will outlast everyone.

That's kind of like speculating that you won't be robbed on the subway with a million dollars in your pocket, isn't it?

It's really not common sense. It's sense that makes sense only to a select few techno-geeks. If you want people who have no more than common sense on their side to adopt bitcoin, you will have to make for them the machine that is always reliable and only connects to the internet when money needs to change hands and never gets hacked or intercepted. And people won't trust you to do that for many years after you've achieved it, they will only trust your track record.
Bitcoin will not become popular until it is accessible to those with nothing more than common sense, and it will not become valuable until it is popular.

That won't happen until its value stabilizes, which defeats the purpose of "going high".

Now all that's left is some fingerprint-encoded security and BitCoin is certain to take off.

Most people keep very little money in their wallet just so it won't matter too much if they get robbed or lose their wallet.
The rest of my money is in a bank.
Client-side security of BitCoin will keep people from buying fully in, and it costs the founders that much.

BitCoin is an experiment and we're all learning how to work with it.
Some of us are more greedy with our experimentation than others.

BitCoin is still an experimental and immature system.
Do not put all your money into BitCoins!

I am a believer in bitcoins and their potential as a future currency. However, as of right now, I will not hold more than a few dollars' worth of bitcoins. Here are my reasons.
 - I cannot trust the security of my wallet. This is because I do not trust my home computers and I know that the bitcoin wallet was designed to be not one shred more secure than the leather wallet in my pocket. I might have done the whole zip up and password protect your wallet backup thing a few months ago, but a few months from now I may not remember what I did with those files or what my password is.
 - I am pointing out the  issue as someone who has taken classes on encryption as part of a computer science degree. If I am reluctant to buy bitcoins, imagine how the ordinary person feels. Bitcoin accessibility is zero at this moment. The ordinary person will never use bitcoins unless some institution with credibility guarantees their bitcoins for them. That means a large bank with deposits, that means trusting this bank and the risk of fractional reserve inflation.
In conclusion, bitcoin is not ready until a safe, accessible client is ready, and it will not have safe haven value like gold until a safe and respected institution backs it.

Read The Diamond Age. This is what it will be like when globalized nations arise.
Stephenson even describes exactly what BitCoin is in an exchange between Miranda and Carl Hollywood about the payments system.

Assuming that a lot of the first generation miners who have that many BitCoins are just regular computer geeks who have never had any significant assets in their lives, I don't think they would know *how* to take precautions.

Currencies don't necessarily need inherent value but they do need "starting value", or they are for all purposes not scarce and useless as a store of value.
However, after a currency bootstraps from its starting value, it has demand strictly for its exclusivity. So, most of the demand for gold is demand for the exclusivity of gold, very little of it is for the industrial or ornamental uses.
BitCoin is now in that zone, so arguing about whether it has starting value is moot. It has started. What turned out to be this starting value is where the interesting economic question occurs. In my opinion, BitCoin's mining protocol created a form of social status among early adopters that had value, and then the process of monetization unfolded.

Bad choice. What happens at the end is nothing short of historic (collapse of the last nation-state, birth of a new synthetic nation forged by the Primer). In fact it is so revolutionary that some people read it without even realizing what has happened, then complain that the ending is bad.

Don't panic. Before they send people to internment camps, they will fine them, then jail them for a few days, then a few weeks, then years, then it will be a full-on war on the cartels who use them the most.
Just like they go after the pirate websites instead of the BitTorrent small users, they will try to take down the big fish instead of large numbers of small ones.

Client-side security. While computer geeks will figure out how to secure their wallets, regular people will get taken in by every trojan/worm that aims to steal their wallet file. This will prevent the general adoption of the currency, unless the traditional banks get into the business of holding wallets.
@_date: 2011-06-10 01:18:18
Think of the bitcoin network as a bank vault, and your wallet.dat as the keys to your security locker. If you don't make a copy of your keys, then losing the key will make you unable to get into the locker. However, if you have many copies of the keys, then you can keep putting money into the box safely.

My biggest worry right now is not being robbed, it's losing my bitcoins. This is why password protection just makes things worse. The backup process of the iPhone would fix this accessibility issue.

I don't think encryption is necessary - you only need encryption to send private data over public lines, and the BitCoin wallet is unencrypted by default anyway. I just need it to be locked sufficiently so that random thugs or children cannot spend all my BitCoins.
And I won't give up my iPhone. It's much more valuable than BitCoins at this time.

This and the problem of convertibility shows that BitCoins are still an immature technology, and are likely undervalued due to their very limited adoption. We should expect more extreme volatility events like yesterday's in the short term.
Once *real* money is invested in applications and exchanges, then we will see the market truly soar.
