Yep. I can't wait.

They did (at least some). But as stated below, you don't need coinbase. Also, it is trival (I think, I've never mixed) to mix before going to coinbase.

If one is American and stuck with that, bovada, and ACR; it's not that bad. Also, big plans such as 8 game and OFC coming in 2015. Pokerstars with BTC would also possibly increase seals traffic. 
Overall, stay out of troll box and it is a soft site with only BTC.

Seals traffic could get a nice boost from this!

If anything, seals will also grow with more players having BTC. TY Micon.

Just a PSA, in the meantime we have TY Micon! Though 180 mans with BTC would be awesome.

If I understand, they use Mavens which is open source. Players have also collected large samples which seem to be fine.
@_date: 2014-12-25 04:02:47
No thanks. After more festivities tomorrow I will try to use vanitygen myself. Maybe try to mine for my last name (9 letters).

Well, I live at home again due to some fuck ups and we're the type of family that eats together at the table and plays board games. So I think so.
My turn: Do you like anal?

mmoclub.com may be able to
sythe.org is also an option - mostly RuneScape but some other games
@_date: 2015-05-22 23:42:49
No I am not. I tried both in Chrome and Firefox. Though I was using private/incognito windows if that could have done something.

Far from polar opposites imo. 
Falkvinge, founder of the first pirate party, made a pirate wheel describing his political visions. While I personally disagree with the wheel on some issues, I feel it is a fairly good reference for many things. Falkvinge is also a big proponent of bitcoin. Sanders is the closest candidate to the recommendations of this wheel. Sadly, the pirate party will not have a candidate in this election, so Sanders will do it for me :).

In Chapel, Hill NC markup is also 9.33%. The owner of it actually sells on LBTC at the same rate.

I tried to set up a test stream but I keep getting 'Channel name is taken, please pick a different one'
So unless someone else picked jimbonerection, I am encountering a problem.

TY MICON!
I love you my dear Icon Mr. Micon.
Keep baby chairwoman safe. Show them all math&gt;&gt;&gt;guns.

At least hypothetically, could a sidechain be programmed to automatically charge VAT? 
Anyway, I am a crypto-anarchist when it comes to the web; but with the rest of life a statist like Bernie.
@_date: 2015-04-30 13:12:02
Yes, probably. But we can work to change that view.
@_date: 2015-04-09 23:06:41
Yep. I hope Sanders does; but might have to wait until the next cycle.

He was the "site pro;" simply the face of the operation. I'm not certain if the server in Vegas was at his house. However, the servers in Europe were also somehow taken down at pretty much the same time. Supposedly there were security flaws in the Mavens software though. The current software and site (swcpoker) was already being worked on because of those flaws. However, because of the raid, the rest of the team (the real operators/owners) abandoned ship. That's not even the right word since they sailed smoothly out returning all btc (you have until May 5th I think).
@_date: 2015-04-30 13:08:48
Yes please. I was actually about to tweet at his about this but I googled to see if it was the case.
@_date: 2015-04-28 23:53:23
I donked off all my coins on seals already, but I may drop by the local BTM and get some for my dearest chairman. You are definitely the best Icon to have in 2015. 
Fuck I'll even testify if possible.
@_date: 2015-03-09 01:33:43
Whoa, I can't believe I haven't seen this site before. Thanks.
@_date: 2015-02-25 00:38:26
Seals, like everywhere else, has many an addict (I am one!). 
I like the idea of licensing as well as would love P2P bitcoin poker. 
However, -EV games should be punnishable by the loss of wealth

I still have never downloaded the whole chain. Today is the day. Also didn't know there was a PPA, so I'll gladly use that.

I love bitcoin because it introduced me to awesome influences from Adam Back (hashcash's creator), Bryan Micon (and many other people from sealswithclubs), Rick Valkvinge (and his priate wheel). I am now on a much better path in life, currently studying math in university to learn cryptography and slowly learning various programming. I want to ensure that humans have the ability bet on any game or sell their body safely without fear of prosecution or theft. Rakeless, open source, serverless poker and safe self-pimping are the future.

My first bitcoin transaction was selling my RSGP to mmoclub (there are also many traders on sythe)

I'll read the whitepaper tomorrow. Had not seen this. Thanks.

My parents are around right now, but I'll check out later. 
I need to learn some of these tools like BCI API for my own projects.
Thank you so much for this. I am slowly learning programming and hope to make a couple websites this myself in the long term this year (specific fetish porn and an open face poker site).
Is there any chance you can share the source code? I love the features like the passphrase cridentials and of course bitcoin. Whoa also did not know wolfram alpha did QR codes for bitcoin. 
Thanks for the influence!
And lastly, I haven't watched much gay porn, but dayum, I love one of those specifically i may have to pay for.
Now I am only getting a grey box instead of video. Audio works though.

It is the same problem as electric cars. People see why it is better than what they have currently, but it is difficult to use it (luckily electric car charging places are popping up everywhere so my dad can charge his leaf). For businesses to accept BTC, people have to demand it. It may be difficult to convince someone to purchase an expensive car just to save a lot on fuel (forgetting environmental benefits), but just setting someone up with a wallet and giving them a uBTC is so easy. As many people say they do on here, spreading the word is the answer.
