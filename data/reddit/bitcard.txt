First we would like to thank you for your fantastic support and a truly successful last year. We have sent thousands of cards around the world. Our demands on our product and our provision of services have constantly increased during the last year. To satisfy our high quality standards, we are constantly developing and improving our products and resources.
We are proud to announce the launch of sales of the 2nd generation of our Bit-Cards.
The new cards feature several improvements and new possibilities. I will introduce the most important changes here.
**New QR-Code**
The new QR-Code is one of the most important changes in comparison to the old card. The old QR-Code was not big enough to be optimally scanned with all devices. We have developed a brand new technique for rendering the QR-Code into an image.  With the new QR-Code problems with scanning will be a thing of the past. 
**Custom value Bit-Cards**
A further request was a Bit-Card with freely selectable amounts. As of now it is possible to create Bit-Cards with almost any chosen amount.
New Features:
**Hologram omitted**
Now it is possible to order Encrypted-Cards without the hologram. Cards without a hologram have a bigger QR-Code for the encrypted private key. In addition the encrypted key will be printed twice on the card in a form legible to the human eye. Now you can check the private key at all times without removing the hologram. 
You can order up to 3 Receive-Cards for each one of your Encrypted-Cards or Wallet-Cards. These Receive-Cards have the same design, the same Bitcoin address, and the same title bar text as the corresponding Encrypted-Cards or Wallet-Card.
One of the most significant new features is the possibility to create card duplicates. You can order up to 9 exact copies of your Encrypted-Cards or Wallet-Card. There is no one original card. All the copies are identical. They have the same private key and the same Bitcoin address.  The cards differ only through the printed tag "COPY XX OF XX".

We will offer cards that do not hold an amount to enable customers to use the cards that way.
You would have to transfer your Bitcoins to the public address on the card and be done.
Now here comes the inevitable but: When doing so there is some trust involved. Like you have to trust a online wallet, when they store your private key in their database, you have trust us that we deleted the private key after producing the card.
We will do everything to make our process transparent and to build that trust (names on the web site, photos to come, address, company registration, etc.), but at the same time we would love to find a way of making trust not an issue.
@_date: 2013-05-16 18:05:14
We did not think about this yet, but I really like the idea and will forward it to the devs. Thank you for your input!
@_date: 2013-04-24 12:59:04
That is why we think it is unevitable to invest a lot of money in the hologram, just the way Casascius did.
Due to the nature of such holograms it is quite cost intensive to set them up and even then it can't be exactly reproduced. So we are confident that this will not be an issue.
@_date: 2013-05-30 11:56:27
Concerning fiat money: Better safe than sorry. We do not want to run into problems with law and/or regulations and will not offer such payment before being 100% sure.
Considering the costs I do not think that 2.96 Euro for the card is too pricey. We invested quite a lot in the security features of the cards (the custom holograms alone cost a 5 digit number, the sandwich cards are custom build too) and I personally think it is better to pay a few cents more than leaving the customer with subpar quality.
@_date: 2013-08-21 10:37:09
Offering two or more copies of one card is something we definitely want to do. We think that distributing copies is a good way to protect a wallet from physical dangers.
That being said, we do not offer this as of now, because we look for a way to make it 100% obvious at the first glance, that there are copies of the specific card that should be handed over with the card.
What we will definitely _not_ do is keeping cards for others. Should someone mess with one of these cards we could have a pretty hard time proving that it wasn't us. Also we simply cannot provide another high security area for customer storage.
@_date: 2013-04-25 07:30:54
Thank you, we let everyone on the list know, when we are ready to send samples out.
@_date: 2013-04-24 14:28:34
BitCards are paper wallets (if you are new to Bitcoin and not familiar with this concept read "top-up cards") that hold a certain amount of Bitcoins.
You are able to check if they still hold the value using the public address printed on the front of the card.
Behind a security hologram you find another address (= the private key), that you need to actually spend the amount on the card.
As these holograms can't be removed in a non-destructive way and they can't be replaced because of the unique design, you can be sure that no one was able to see the private key as long as the hologram is untouched.
I am quite sure an native speaker could do better in explaining the whole thing, so maybe someone can help out.
Scenarios we initially thought of, are getting a physical item when buying bitcoins, using the cards to give away small amounts of Bitcoins as a tip or just to spread the word about Bitcoin.
Of course you could use them as a monetary gift card or even pay with them.
@_date: 2013-09-20 12:48:53
We'll do our very best to make FIAT payments possible for Bit-Cards eventually, as we also feel this would be huge.
@_date: 2013-05-30 19:41:47
The Bit-Card is actually a paper wallet with some extra features so the Bitcoins are stored offline.
@_date: 2013-07-08 09:28:35
Thank you for the compliment on the website... and I guess thanks for the "bunch of Germans" part as well. ;-)
@_date: 2013-04-24 12:29:49
Thank you, very nice idea, we'll add this our feature list.
@_date: 2013-05-16 14:06:35
Thank you. And yes, we plan to distribute the cards via different stores in the future.
On the subject of laws: Currently we are in the process of working out, what we can and can’t do in different countries.
@_date: 2013-07-22 13:14:57
The cards are printed in-house and the private key is printed on the card as well.
The key generation and the printing is done on a offline system and directly after printing the cards the hologramms are applied and everything is done under the two-man rule.
@_date: 2013-06-20 13:12:18
Hi Reddit,
With nearly three weeks gone since our last update we'd like to share some more news.
We are still doing some polishing but the website is nearly finished, while the software for the production system is already set and done. Even the super stylish and super secret stickers that will be included as a giveaway are here. Right now we are waiting for the holograms to arrive, allowing us to release the whole thing.
In the mean time I would like to draw your attention to our **[One World, One Currency]( [(LINK)]( action, where we give away free Wallet-Cards to people from each and every country around the world to learn about international postal running times, loss rates and most important to promote the idea of Bitcoin being a currency for the whole world.
We will provide more information on the release date soon, so make sure not to miss out and subscribe to our newsletter at 
Your Bit-Card Team
@_date: 2013-08-21 07:46:51
The company is registered under German law, doing business since 2010  and we work with high profile partners around the world.
We already provided our names and personal information (including photographs etc.) and information about our process on the website.
In short: We stand to lose a lot if somebody decides to kick our door in and there are copies of the private keys.
@_date: 2013-06-11 14:35:48
Correct. For non-standardised amount you can use the Wallet Card that comes without an amount pre-loaded.
@_date: 2013-07-11 13:26:24
We are trying to "fix" this issue as we speak. ;-)
@_date: 2013-04-24 14:05:05
Firstbits: We will look for a way to integrate this in the design, thanks.
Personal details: We will definitely post fotos, etc. on the web site together with information about our process.
@_date: 2013-04-24 11:26:56
I can assure you, that it feels nice. Thickness is about the same as a credit card.
The design of the back is currently not finished, we still tinker around with the text explaining bitcoin in general and the use of the card and let them translate.
@_date: 2013-07-05 12:34:02
Hello Reddit,
Over the past few months we shared our progress on the Bit-Cards with you. Today we are very excited and nervous, as we just launched our website and the store at  . All listed products are of course immediately available.
We want to thank you for the constructive feedback we received along the way and express our hopes, that you will keep your suggestions coming and tell us about product wishes. We promise to listen!
Of course we work already on implementing new features, designs and completely new products.
Your Bit-Card Team
@_date: 2013-07-24 07:36:40
Will get back to you via mail asap.
@_date: 2013-04-25 07:40:11
Thank you, we let everyone on the list know, when we are ready to send samples out.
@_date: 2013-07-22 11:26:45
Hi Reddit,
It has now been two weeks since we reported last time. Since then, a lot has happened at [Bit-Card](
 First Bitcoin-Invoice
We are particularly pleased to have paid our first company-related invoice with Bitcoins. We will of course continue to try to push all of our suppliers to accept Bitcoins.
# .
 New Products
 Custom Design Cards
In the last few weeks, we have seen so many really amazing card designs that we now want to provide everyone the opportunity to design their own cards. We then print your own designs on either one side or both sides of a white card as you require.
 Custom Background
Most of our cards can now be ordered with a custom background. A custom background helps you give your card a personal touch.
 Receive Cards
Receive-Cards make it easy to share your Bitcoin address with friends and customers and receive payments. For even better readability, Receive-Cards are printed with a larger QR code of the Bitcoin address and contain NO private key.
 Individually Named Cards
Individually Named Cards are especially convenient for replacing the traditional paper wallet or transfer non-standardized amounts, they are not pre-loaded by us. In addition to the Wallet-Cards features, you can add your own text to the title bar.
# .
 Outlook
 Wallet printer in Europe
We are currently negotiating with several suppliers of Bitcoin-specific products. We are pleased that we can include the Keychains by bitcoinkeychains.com in our product line in the next few days. We are also in negotiations with piperwallet.com and hope that we can soon offer Bitcoin Piper in Europe.
 Other Products
We would of course like to expand our range of in-house manufactured products. We plan to introduce MofN cards, two-factor cards (BIP 0038) and special cards for charity organizations.
Your Bit-Card Team

Hi, top up cards is what we are going to launch pretty soon, you might want to check out:
@_date: 2013-08-21 07:59:05
Thank you for you kind review 123felix!
The delivery time is still sort of a mystery to us. Distance does not seem to be a problem, as we had cards delivered to Japan in three and four days, while US seems to be 7-14 days and Australia 10-20 days.
Some problems with the QR code seem to be app specific. We tested them with quite a few devices (after all we are from the mobile sector ;)) and included bad/older cams. You might want to try QR Droid Private on your Nexus.
If we hear about bended cards from more customers we will consider using envelopes with a carton back.
@_date: 2013-04-24 14:59:26
Thank you!
@_date: 2013-09-12 07:13:16
Thank you for offering your participation. Please head over to
where you'll find all the instruction needed.

@_date: 2013-04-24 11:13:56
Technically it is a cold wallet, yes. 
But just like Casascius physical coins there is something more to it: As long, as the hologram is valid you can be sure that the nominal amount is still on the wallet.
Also, one of the possible uses of the cards is to give them away to less tech savvy people, who like the idea of getting a physical item, to get them started with a small amount of Bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-04-24 11:00:34
Thank you. If you you want, you can enter our mailing list at  
@_date: 2013-05-16 18:04:18
First and most importantly there is the hologram. We designed a hologram specifically for these cards and due to the very nature of such holograms they cannot be reproduced to a hair's breadth.
The sandwich cards we use for the Bit-Card are custom-build too.
The verification page for every card will provide information on the card that helps to reveal such counterfeit.
@_date: 2013-09-20 13:58:32
If you order a card with a face value you pay for the card plus the face value. The card is then sent to you and the face value is transferred after receival. The whole process is also shown in this [info graphic](
Please find detailed information about withdrawal at out website: [How to use](

Hi shallnotwastetime,
We just found the thread and checked the address and there was probably a blank space behind the key. When copying &amp; pasting please make sure you do not accidentally copy copy blank spaces.
Also please write to support if you should encounter any problems. We do monitor Reddit from time to time, but this should be a much smoother and faster experience.
And: We'll fix the "adress(e)", ja! ;-)
@_date: 2013-05-30 10:46:58
In the beginning this is very unlikely.
However: We are very interested in accepting fiat too and actively look into ways to do so.
@_date: 2013-05-16 14:26:02
Even without knowing exactly why BitBills canceled ordering in 2011 we are aware of many scenarios that might cause problems and of course we do think to be prepared.
@_date: 2013-04-24 09:11:35
Two days ago we posted about Bit-Card on Reddit and on several other forums. We already received valuable feedback, for which we want to thank everybody.
We thought this would be a good time to share pictures of some actual samples of Bit-Cards. Of course this is not the hologram that will be on the final cards.
Please keep the feedback coming, this helps us to get you the best product and a maximum of transparency.
@_date: 2013-06-20 13:52:41
Sorry if we didn't communicate this right: If you are not comfortable with your picture on the blog you are of course free to take a picture of the Wallet-Card in a characteristic environment of your country without you being on the actual picture.
This is about Bitcoin being used around the world (and to be fair about us getting information about post running times and reliability) and not about you promoting our card in a testimonial way.
I changed the post, thank you for your input.
@_date: 2013-05-16 17:58:38
1. Sure. With the development of the cards being nearly finished getting the web site ready to be launched is what we work on currently.
2. That is something we really would like to do. Right now we are going for relatively thick cards as they feel valuable and offer optimal protection against attempts to find out the private key without having to destroy the hologram.
3. This sure is a nice thing to do in the future. Right now our focus is on the release of the Bit-Cards, but I added this to our future to-dos.
@_date: 2013-09-12 06:30:36
Please contact me at support [at] bit-card [dot] com . For most parts of the world this is _way_ to long.
@_date: 2013-04-24 15:23:43
Disclaimer: I am 99% sure the following post is correct, however please do not consider this an official instruction until you see it on our web site.
From what I know by heart the easiest way to do should be to import the key to Blockchain.info and transfer an partial amount to another public key.
Afaik Blockchain.info uses the existing address as change address unlike the QT client.
@_date: 2013-04-24 11:01:44
123felix is right. Also, one of the QR codes will be hidden by the hologram anyway.
@_date: 2013-05-16 17:49:54
As voiceofxp pointed out, there are some problems that come with accepting credit card payments for Bitcoins, fraud and the possible status as bank/money transferer not being the least of them.
That being said, we would _love_ to find a way to accept payments via credit card or PayPal, that is save, legal and convenient for everybody.
@_date: 2013-04-24 13:18:44
Thank you for your input. The samples use an older design, we already switched to mBTC. Currently we plan to offer 1 BTC, 500, 250, 100, 50, 10, 5, 1 mBTC.
The small amount are headed towards give away cards to spread the word about Bitcoin.
You might want to check out  too.
@_date: 2013-09-20 14:37:08
To be honest: I don't know if the Casascius tool or ours can be compiled under Linux, Mono Projects comes into my mind, but I am not a programmer though.
The  should work anyway. If I remember this correctly you should be able to download the website and run it without inernet connection.
@_date: 2013-04-24 15:26:58
We can't wait to get our hands on the actual holograms to finally get started. :)
@_date: 2013-09-11 14:47:12
Maybe that helps.
@_date: 2013-09-11 09:40:45
Hi everybody,
Some time ago we introduced our campaign to promote Bitcoin as a currency that can be used by everyone around the world.
We sent out Wallet-Cards with the unique design to some countries already and received cool images from many different places that we want to share with the community.
However, there are many places on this map with pictures missing. We are looking for people from all over the world to join the campaign and send pictures. If you want to take part please don't hesitate to head over to
and let us know!
@_date: 2013-04-24 14:10:36
I might get killed if I talk about future products. ;-)
Seriously: Yes we thought about NFC and look for ways to do this.
@_date: 2013-04-22 21:49:13
Yes, you are right. It would be risky. So we plan to send the cards empty. This should be the best way.
@_date: 2013-06-21 07:06:22
Thank you for participating and thank you for this awesome idea. I changed the post accordingly.
@_date: 2013-05-16 14:43:08
Thank you for pointing this out! We are aware of this and will include this to our guidelines on how to use the cards.
@_date: 2013-09-12 08:21:03
Thank you for the pictures and no worries about forgetting them, I didn't even bring in my own from my hometown. ;)
We will send the promised 5 mBTC to your card with the next run of card fundings.
@_date: 2013-04-24 13:14:54
You are right, trust is an issue. An issue we would love to get out of the way too, because even with the best reputation, maximum transparency and and a flawless track record this will keep some people from using our product.
We think about and work on ways of getting rid of this while keeping the use of Bit-Card as easy as possible.
@_date: 2013-05-30 13:56:13
Thanks for pointing this out. We are aware and these are indeed stock photographs we purchased.
@_date: 2013-08-21 07:48:34
Thank you for your business. The information can be found und "Process"
We use a computer system that operates without internet access to create the Bitcoin-addresses and for the production of the Bit-Card. In an effort to guarantee maximum security, we use custom-built software to create the Bitcoin-addresses and QR-codes.
Therefore the private Bit-Card key cannot be read, stored or transferred at any time.
**The created keys are stored on the Bit-Card exclusively and are not saved or stored in any form by us. Please note that we are unable to assist you in the event the card is destroyed or lost.**
@_date: 2013-09-20 14:19:53
As you pay with BTC anyway you would not have to purchase another Bitcoin. Also you could buy a card that has [no face value](
All Bit-Cards with a value printed on them are only sold with this amount as we do not want cards to be around, that are correctly activated and do not contain their face value.
@_date: 2013-09-11 12:45:15
Yes, the cards are cold storage wallets with the private key being covered by an purpose build hologram.
@_date: 2013-07-05 14:33:04
The base shop system is magento. (open source). No password will be stored. Only hashes.
@_date: 2013-04-22 21:53:39
We are working on some technical solutions for this problem. But meanwhile we do everything creating a maximum of transparency. 
@_date: 2013-04-24 11:41:59
Just like with credit cards we think there is no way that you do not have to trust the manufacturer.
Like Casascius we will be as transparent as possible and release every information.
However, we are not too happy about this, we think about and work on ways of getting rid of this.
@_date: 2013-07-05 13:50:34
already shipped :-)
@_date: 2013-08-21 07:49:29
Could you please elaborate the problem you have/had? The website seems to be working for us.
@_date: 2013-07-05 19:47:28
Is coming next weeks... 
@_date: 2013-05-30 11:43:48
After that you might want to check out the verification link on the cards to find out if someone did deposit Bitcoins on the card. ;-)
@_date: 2013-05-16 18:08:25
Thank you!
@_date: 2013-04-24 16:29:11
The design of the back is currently not finished, we still tinker around with the text explaining bitcoin in general and the use of the card and let them translate.
@_date: 2013-07-22 14:33:24
Uhm... I don't know. From what I get from BIP 0038 these custom codes are not part of it? Might be just me though as I am not a programmer and do not understand everything. ;)
Could you please elaborate a bit more? I will point Carsten and Steffen here in the morning.

@_date: 2013-06-11 11:30:00
If you can wait a short while this sounds exactly like the kind of thing we are making the Bit-Cards for.
Instead of a simple printout your friend will get an awesome card.
If you want to know more please check out our post history or subscribe to our newsletter.
@_date: 2013-04-24 11:57:29
Thanks for your input.
Yes, these cards are just samples to play around with and test the different holograms. We will adjust design/saturation a bit for the actual cards.
Maybe we make 'pop' a bit more. ;-)
@_date: 2013-05-30 09:51:04
The cheapest way would to pick them up at our office. ;)
That being said: No, the shipping is not included. Shipping rates are calculated by weight and will start at 0,69 Euro for single card within Germany and 0,86 Euro worldwide.
@_date: 2013-06-20 14:15:09
Sure enough! There you go:
@_date: 2013-05-30 12:21:34
After shipment. We will provide you with an activation code to fund the card after receiving them.
@_date: 2013-05-30 15:18:49
Yes, this would be great. But paying with fiat is more a legal challenge. So we have to check that twice. Anyway, we sure we are working on that. 
@_date: 2013-09-11 13:54:10


No reason to downvote SweetMexicanJesus in my opinion.
Yes, we absolutely do not think that "One World, One Currency" shares the same sentiment as the infamous slogan mentioned above as Bitcoin is a non-discriminatory currency that can be used by people in the whole world. Also we think that "one currency" does should not be read as "the only currency".
But then again if somebody wants to share his concerns in a no-nonsense way he should not be downvoted.
@_date: 2013-04-24 14:49:06
Thank you for your input! Unfortunately this is not a monospaced font, which we would prefer.
However, I forwarded this to the person in charge of the design and he will look into this.
@_date: 2013-04-24 12:18:33
Yes you will be able to transfer part of the funds and we will provide detailed information on how to do it.
@_date: 2013-09-20 14:46:04
Good point, will get this added next week.
@_date: 2013-05-30 12:52:15
On the final cards the private key will of course be protected by the tamper-evident security hologram, that cannot be removed without destroying it.
The picture shows samples of "raw" prints without the hologram.
We do not think that the the majority of the cards will circulate all that much. We think most people will use them as evangelism tools or in the case of the wallet card as cold storage for themself or friends.
@_date: 2013-05-30 15:23:22
Good idea. Sounds interesting. We will think about it. 
@_date: 2013-08-21 07:20:35
You are right, unfortunately there is no such thing as 100% security. And though the Bit-Cards are not designed to be a payment method for daily usage and to go through many hands we do everything to make them as secure as possible.
As an added layer of security we introduced a security cut in late July. The complex form renders the attack shown later at Defcon at least considerable harder.
@_date: 2013-09-20 12:24:34
From what I get the intermediate key ist not a hash from the passphrase and the pass phrase is not the private key. It is "just" the password to decrypt the encrypted private key.
Unlike a brain wallet with [BIP 0038]( you can create tons of different addresses with the same password and each would be save as long as no one knows the encrypted key and your passphrase.
@_date: 2013-04-25 07:38:06
The public key is on the card as QR code and as letters/numbers, so the amount on the card can be checked quite easily.
@_date: 2013-07-08 09:42:32
Right now you can order Bit-Cards from 1 mBTC to 1 BTC face value. We are looking into accepting indidual face values as an personalisation option. 1.337 Bitcoin or 666 mBTC anyone? ;-)
If you want to store an non-standardised amount we would like to suggest our Wallet-Cards. These cards are not pre-loaded.
@_date: 2013-04-24 12:50:52
Yes and it is over 9000! ;-)
In all honesty it was just zeh Germans looking for an English name to put on the mock-up. 
@_date: 2013-06-21 06:48:32
Thank you for the praise and of course thank you for the tip.
And we got the broad hint, offering cards for altcoins are certainly one of the things we will look into once everything is up and running.
@_date: 2013-04-24 11:04:25
We will start with pvc cards and plan to add other materials later.
@_date: 2013-05-17 12:53:34
Long term: For sure, if there is a demand.
Short term: No, we focus on getting the Cards for Bitcoin out.
@_date: 2013-09-12 07:11:36

Head over to 
"One World, One Currency" cards:
 + a bit of luck. ;)

Hi Reddit,
**[Two Factor Bit-Cards are live
Many of you guys asked us to implement Two Factor Bit-Cards as
described in [BIP 0038]( for our
cards and we listened. Today we are happy to announce the
implementation of this feature.
The Passphrase-Protected Cards offer a particularly high level of
protection since the private key has been generated in encrypted form
and stored on the card that way,  just so that it cannot become known
to either us or any third parties. Decrypting your private key is only
possible using your passphrase.
As always this is not a preannouncement, the Passphrase-Protected
Cards are already in the shop and can be bought.
**[Keychains (LINK)](
With the awesome keychains from
[jonwaller]( we added the first
third-party product to our storefront. Buy them to show your love to
Bitcoin in style or spread the word of Bitcoin by handing them to a
friend together with their first BTC on a Bit-Card.
If you happen know or offer other Bitcoin related products that would

Carsten has been present at the Berlin Bitcoin Exchange 2 and 3. To
promote the event we issued Bit-Cards that were only available on site
and that came in a unique design. We plan on issuing more of such
cards on different occasions in the future, so watch out fo them!
**[European Bitcoin Convention (LINK)](
For everyone attending the European Bitcoin Conference we have
exceptional good news. We agreed with the organizer on printing the
conference passes for them. The passes will be personalized, fully
operational Bit-Cards that come with a small amount of Bitcoin and in
a special design only available at this event.
If you happen to be in Amsterdam Carsten would love to talk and
present Bit-Cards in person.
*P.S.: Shop categories - While adding the categories for these new
products to our shop system it became clear, that our category names
might be be descriptive but they are not very appealing at all. Part
of the problem might be a bunch of Germans deciding on them.Reddit, we
would like to ask for your input and your recommendations on how to
improve our category and product naming.*

We will definitely offer such cards with slightly changed design to make obvious, that this is a wallet card. As mentioned above these cards will not have the original hologram, as we see the hologram as a kind of official seal.
We have not yet decided on what we will deliver instead to protect the private key.
@_date: 2013-04-24 10:59:38
Yes, this was one of the things we meade the samples for.
@_date: 2013-04-24 12:10:49
Although not too pretty the font is designed to be distinguishable. We uploaded a picture that might make it a bit more obvious.
If you know of a font that does the job better we would love your input.

As much as we would like to offer a hardware wallet, this is a whole other beast to develope.
@_date: 2013-04-24 11:17:38
Right, the public key is "just" there to check the balance.
And yes, spreading the word with these cards was definitely one of the things we had in mind as a possible usecase.
@_date: 2013-09-20 14:11:55
Good question. :) To create a backup of the encrypted private key you would indeed have to remove the hologram and create a physical copy or digital copy of the key.
The key cannot be reproduced in any way.
We currently look into offering two or more copies of the same cards as a backup. We will offer this if we find a way to make 101% obvious that there are copies, that have to be handed over with card in case it gets passed on. Unfortunately there is a lot of potential harm that can be done with such copies if we fail to make this obvious.

Great idea!
@_date: 2013-04-25 07:22:50
Thank you, we are aware of this problem. One thing we will do is change the design a bit to reflect this is not a Bit-Card, but a wallet card.
More important we think of the hologram as a kind of official seal and would not send out such a hologram with these cards.
Currently we have not decided if we will create another hologram for such cards, send out normal stickers or do something else to help the customer to protect the key, but we are aware, that we cannot send our holograms.
@_date: 2013-06-21 06:42:52
We are very aware of such problems, in this case however we do not think that "One World, One Currency" shares the same sentiment, as the slogan you linked to.
@_date: 2013-07-05 18:42:58
There are a lot reasons why we would never do that.
@_date: 2013-04-24 12:16:19
We definitely plan to do some sort of activation process. One reason is the risk of loss on the transport and another reason is customs.

Thank you for your interest in Bit-Card Reddit! Since our last announcement we achieved some progress that we would like to share with you.
First and most importantly we finalized and ordered the holograms. Setup and production will take a few weeks and once we received the delivery we will provide pictures of them and information on the security features on a dedicated site.
We finished the design for the back side of the card and would like to ask you for your thoughts on the instructions / wording.
Also we received samples of the sandwich PVC cards we will use for Bit-Card from the manufacturer. We did security tests with them and were blown away by the results. They are everything we hoped for – and more.
However: As “good” is just not good enough for us we decided to go the extra mile and make the black core even thicker.
We will provide more information within the next weeks, so make sure to subscribe to our newsletter at 
@_date: 2013-04-24 14:40:00
We tested different hologram types and different glues and were not able to read the key without clear evidence.
Currently we think of sending sample cards to interested people from our mail list to let them try.

2 different companies! Our domain is bit-card.com. We can't find any company/legal informations on the other website. So we do not know who is running the other website.

Our cards could be interesting for you:

@_date: 2013-04-24 11:52:38
We absolutely plan to do such cards. You can get an idea how they will look like on  (Wallet Card in the middle).
@_date: 2013-07-05 18:24:40
The system sends it immediately. But the concerns are correct. So we will change that soon. 
@_date: 2013-05-30 14:28:56
First we think there is a point in buying the cards with Bitcoins. Use them for evangelism, as gift cards or simply as a safe way to store your Bitcoins.
As I've pointed out, we would very much like to accept fiat money, but we won't until we are 100% sure that we are allowed to do so.

(personal note)
Thank you for the explanation of RAW and thank you for keeping the files at hand. I feel many photographers would absolutely benefit from shooting RAW and processing their files on the PC. Even more so when shooting with such an excellent dynamic range as the CCD of the D5100 has. Still an awesome little cam! :)

Because scratch layers are very easy to reproduce and a peeled of layer can be restored at low cost.
@_date: 2013-05-16 17:45:07
Yes, this is correct. This is step 1 of verification and we'll provide a quite easy way to do so with the verification link on the front side.

We are a company registered under German law and based in Germany. The company is around since 2010 and our names are on the web site.
We will release detailed documentation on how the keys are created (offline system, etc.) and handled through the whole process prior to the launch.
Much like Casascius we plan to release a list with all public keys ever used and much more.
We absolutely know, that trust is one of the key things with these cards and we want to be as transparent as possible. This is why we came here in this early stage, to come and see what you guys would like to be done to increase trust.
@_date: 2013-04-24 12:35:58
That is one thing we have in mind, even though we would very much prefer a solution that has every information, that is needed to retrieve the funds, right from the start on the card, to minimize the chance of error and/or loss.
@_date: 2013-05-30 12:19:28
We are aware, that earning trust is the single most difficult and most crucial task within the whole process.
The company is registered under German law and doing business since 2010. We already provided our names on the current static web page and will provide more personal information (including photographs etc.) and information about our process on the soon-to-be-revealed web site.
Also we already invested a lot of time and money into this, instead of just setting up a pretty website and taking pre-orders, which hopefully is an indication that we are worth the trust. ;-)
@_date: 2013-05-16 14:32:45
For the pre-loaded cards there will be an activation process. The cards will be sent empty for the sake of safety (and customs) and activated after reception is confirmed.
@_date: 2013-08-21 12:07:12
Bit-Cards have a face value and they come pre-loaded with that face value. You could for instance use them for tipping or to introduce people to Bitcoin.
Wallet-Cards do not have a face value and come without a balance.
@_date: 2013-04-24 14:59:18
Well, for one it is our understanding, that BitBill went out of business, at least their web site isn't updated since 2011.
Also from what I see on the pictures they went with generic hologram, that can be replaced easier.
Like Casascius we have our own hologram design that can't be replaced.
Also, as I said, we are not happy with this situation and would love to get rid of people having to trust a manufacturer, but unfortunately there seems to be no other way right now.
@_date: 2013-09-20 12:13:34
Honest answer: I'll try. I am good with numbers, but I suck at math. ;)
First you choose a passphrase and enter it in one of the tools we linked in the description of the product. The programm does math and magic and gives you an intermediate key that you send to us.
The private key on your card is encrypted with this key. Cool thing is that it is created that way. So not even when creating the key we are able to find out the unencrypted private key.
TL;DR: You choose a passphrase and math protects your private key. Even from us who created the card and the key.
@_date: 2013-05-30 09:02:33
Hello everybody,
It’s been two weeks since we gave an update and today we are glad to share some more news.
The finalized work pieces of the cards have arrived and so did the printing technology. Our custom software works properly and we are able to print cards. On the product side we are just waiting for the holograms to arrive.
Right now we are focusing our work on the web site and the shopping system.
Many of you asked about the expected price of the Bit-Cards. The price will be the equivalent of 2.96 Euro in BTC per card, plus its face value of course. At the current exchange rate this is about 22.7 mBTC (0.0227 BTC).
We will provide more information within the next weeks, so make sure to subscribe to our newsletter at 
@_date: 2013-09-20 14:43:43
No there is no way for you to know or decrypt the private key from the passphrase and/or the intermediate.
Let's try to summon [Carsten_bit-card]( He will be back this evening and join the discussion but is away from the office right now.
