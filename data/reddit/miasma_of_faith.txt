Remember, it's typical to hear a lot of screams when the rollercoaster is falling.

So, this has gotta be manipulation right? Was it manipulated to be lower, or is it currently manipulating to go higher?

I doubt it means anything TBH. For one, quantum is still in it's infancy and its largely untested. We don't know how effective it will truly be. Right now it's in it's hype state. But for all we know it could flop on it's face. This kind of thing happens a lot in the tech world.
For two, I imagine BTC would adapt somehow whether it's a fork or some other kind of change to keep up. It will be quantum resistant long before quantum computers are available.

Not sure why people even think about listening to these so called "experts." They literally learn nothing and often just double down on their stupidity. Even now this dude is spouting how this still perfectly fits his plan for Bitcoin hitting $2000 by EoY.

Most shorts expired yesterday, so they likely didn't get wrecked. In fact they probably cashed out in the green. It's something we have to pay attention to moving forward. If BTC goes down at the end of the month it's like manipulation.

I agree with you, but at the same time this is common in any financial forum.

Buying and volume is going up, bullish news dropping (such as the Canada exchange listing), yet the price is going down. That's got my attention, SOMETHING is going to happen. I'm not sure if it'll be good or bad but SOMETHING is going to happen.

Possibly futures being manipulated. As in, whales bought contracts saying that bitcoins price would go down, and then when the contract was nearing expiration they mass sold to manipulate BTC into going down so that the futures contract makes them bank. 
They can then use that money to reinvest into BTC, allowing them to own even more than they did before.

First they beat the Flyers, then this.  Not too shabby Lausanne.

Future contracts expire and we suddenly go green. ������
Wonder if the cycle is just starting anew.

You could stop there and describe about 95% of comments in the crypto-sphere.

I want to believe.
But I also know that you buy the hype and sell the news, meaning that once they launch we may actually see a drop, instead of a rise.
Don't get me wrong, I'm bullish long term, but I wouldn't be surprised if it fell at that time.

46.1 billion on volume...that's insane.

This is from season 8 episode 17 "My Sister My Sitter" and what you're implying isn't true. It had nothing to do with cryptocurrency, it had to do with BAD BABYSITTING. Bart thought she made money by watching TV, but she was babysitting. The "Crypto Bar" was a background gag of crappy stores and only on screen for 2-3 seconds. Again, nothing to do with cryptocurrency.  Watch the ep if you don't believe and then go to bread.
