no insurance on bfx
@_date: 2016-08-02 19:32:50
if I had a long open (trading account), does that affect where my bitcoins are stored and thus whether or not I have been hacked?
@_date: 2016-08-03 00:43:00
cuz i am a moron...i cant believe it myself
@_date: 2016-08-03 09:42:18
Thanks CFTC for ruining my life
@_date: 2016-08-07 22:36:10
BFX, this is bad. Now, we don't judge you if you come clean and lower that 36% haircut number, claiming it was a rushed figure. But we will not accept you guys keeping the customers in the dark and not contributing with company assets.
Remember, it was YOUR negligence and lack of security that lead to this. Users did nothing wrong!
@_date: 2016-08-03 00:36:18
I understand. And please bear with me for losing my life savings
@_date: 2016-08-03 00:21:24
please respond to my private message
@_date: 2016-08-02 22:31:54
it's time for you to talk about the 100k+ BTC speculated losses
@_date: 2016-08-27 19:54:04
Yeah awesome. Let's not mention the elephant in the room, the fact that 90% of that "volume" is unregulated wash trading from scammy chinese exchanges?
Looking at volume while these players are in the game is not a good metric. Period
@_date: 2016-08-06 19:49:46
@_date: 2016-08-03 00:57:43
thank you :(
@_date: 2016-08-15 23:44:22
Wow you are one greedy motherfunker. Can you please give a second to think about the people who ACTUALLY lost money on the hack?
@_date: 2016-08-04 20:37:12
What a lousy explanation from a so called "100% secure" third party who's ONLY job was to protect all those coins from theft. BitGo, please BitGo Fuck Yourself
@_date: 2018-01-26 09:27:24
Aaaaaaaaand it happened

That's bullshit, we went 800-400 and back in 2014 or 2013 in a few hours

Very happy about this, time to go up!

Expect some serious trolling very soon :/

How exactly do you add value when all your spending leads to is that a payment processor market sells the exact value of your purchase? Spending=Selling
Simple as that

Don't ask the barber whether or no you need a haircut

Not necessarily? I mean it's government stuff, rules are rules
@_date: 2016-12-31 03:46:32
It's difficult. Then again, Sweden is not India where u have a few days before your cash gets invalid. The government gave like 2 years for everyone to get rid of their old bills before discarding them
@_date: 2016-12-31 03:26:40
I'm swedish and you're kinda misunderstanding the point because of google translate. The main problem was not that she couldn't explain where she got them, the problem is that those bills were old and had had to be turned in for new ones (and this lady had not been informed of this). The central bank would, however, be able to make an exception and redeem her old useless bills, provided that she could show proof of their origin. Which she couldn't, hence this article

If F2Pool was a large player, yes. But no, it's not
@_date: 2017-04-11 08:30:11
This is very worrying...No need for finex to act as a hero and sue a huge bank imo
@_date: 2017-04-18 09:40:42
My point is that their 9.6% will not make or break segwit activation. it is all up to Jihan, without him, 95% will be _impossible_

This is GOOD for bitcoin, if by GOOD, we mean HORRIBLE

Anyone who owns 70btc reads this reddit on a regular. Won't be difficult to find out who the "friend" is and maybe even prevent it
@_date: 2017-10-11 07:12:41
How much do u have left?
@_date: 2017-10-06 23:17:27
Currently over 30k shorts on Bitfinex. All of these will either have to close, or they will owe 1 B2X for every BTC they are short....this is insanely bullish for the real Bitcoin
