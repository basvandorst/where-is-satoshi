Tbh i belive i never posted in this sub i left it quite early to go over to r/btc but i turned out now people are there about the same. Iam really sick of it and i left Bitcoin because i could not take it´s community anymore... Bitcoin is not the same Bitcoin when i started, it was something dark and nerdy and a little bit scary, first time when i bought at virwox (this 2nd live Linden$ exchange) i thought i would instantly get arrested just for having bitcoin. :D And when i started with Bitcoin Cash a few months ago it felt kinda the same... but it turned out it´s entirely the same Shitfest as soon as the Money flow´s in... PPL´s attitude change they become greedy... Back then i did not know any names except Satoshi and even him was not a real person. And now i can think of plenty who all try to act like leader´s of BTC and BCH. I wished Bitcoin become again what it was... but sadly i think over.

Very good advise... exactly what i was thinking... :)  I got out at the first news of exchanges in china might be closing... don´t regret it yet. Problem is that most of the ppl in reddit think cryptos are a Teamgame... When it rises everybody cheers... When it falls everybody praises the dip. But this is serious and these guys don´t realise it. PPL need to learn Money is not magically created just by bitcoin if someone got a profit someone else made a loss... leaving the delusional hodlers behind.
