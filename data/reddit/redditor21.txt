Im going to reply to everyone in this thread so if you commented twice and you get two replies, sorry. 
This site is a scam. If you look at ALL of the accounts that say something positive about this site, or claim that they were paid, all have something in common. They have very little post history, and the last 6 months all have something in common, the previous comments all occurred at the exact same times, about one month apart. someone has been planning this scam for a while.  
@_date: 2015-12-10 04:45:45
Sure. Post some screenshots if ya dont mind?
Obviously remove any personal information

I would scramble that url. You know someone is going to click it 
@_date: 2014-06-25 05:21:41
So basically you figured out how to install stuff over ssh and now you think you deserve 1.75%?
I think someone has an ego :P

Hi btc-plazza rep :P
@_date: 2014-06-24 10:22:38
Yeah, its not suspicious at all that you are combing this thread replying to almost all comments on how much they are not a scam. 
@_date: 2014-06-18 08:50:59
Could be,  the original comment didn't really make sense
@_date: 2014-11-30 02:34:26
THIS. This one thing wasted about 4 hours of my life a couple of days ago...
@_date: 2014-06-24 10:23:30
its unbelievable because its bullshit. Op is using a sensationalized title to gain attention (visibility) 
I hope a mod steps in and removes this post
@_date: 2014-03-01 22:29:01
Check back on the IP in about an hour, It looks like many of the the open NTP servers have been patched so I may have to come up a workaround :)

Yeah, im not declaring shit to anyone. 
@_date: 2014-09-08 23:38:18
Glad someone else picked up on that :P
@_date: 2014-01-29 22:15:52
I honestly had no idea. I knew they were going to start requiring verification HOWEVER that shouldn't mean they denying withdrawal requests at THEIR convenience 
@_date: 2014-07-26 09:11:26
More importantly, who's the name of this model? I need it for a bitcoin paper im publishing next year
@_date: 2014-12-26 00:10:58
What market is that? Could be a honeypot...
@_date: 2014-12-04 10:58:24
Lol Op's reddit is account is only 14 hours old, having fun there PR?

Gotcha, but I do know there are a LOT of other accounts that are a couple hours old pretending to be potential "customers"

what kind of laptop do you have? 
1)Disable its wifi and take a ethernet cable and plug your laptop into your xbox
2) go into your network options on your laptop and disable IPV6 and manually change your ipv4 address to something like 192.168.1.49 and set your subnet (same box) to 255.255.255.0
3)open terminal (on windows its "command prompt") and ping that address (192.168.1.49)
4) post what you see here :)

That's pretty awesome of him! I probably will never cash out 100% because ive seen so many lives destroyed by unexpected financial uncertainties. I do know that ill never spend it on something that isn't necessary or simply for the idea of impressing others. Over this last summer I managed to meet the right people and ended up working over 65 hours a week away from home on a construction job on the north slope (alaska) and was making a little north of $20 an hour. Its always been our dream to travel the world together and we are planning to take some time off from college because after all “The world is a book and those who do not travel read only one page.”

Exactly. I figured out how to use TOR. I am now a black hat SQL penetration hacker

@_date: 2014-01-15 08:59:36
No, Im 17 and hold almost $50,000 in ltc, I cash out a couple thousand a month and never had an issue ;)
@_date: 2014-01-15 09:16:58
Yeah, im 17 and 3/4 right now ;) Due to the nature of the value, I cannot tell anyone. My girlfriend who I adore doesn't even know ;( Its so hard to keep your mouth shut all the time. Probably the only thing that would make me cash out is if someone close to me got a disease not covered by insurance and needed a large sum of money
@_date: 2014-09-08 23:37:48
I live in plamer alaska and it runs around $750 a month for a 35x40 well insulated 3 story house... 
@_date: 2014-07-09 17:49:47
Come up to Alaska :)
@_date: 2014-11-30 06:38:10
Sure yeah. So they buy it  couple months ago at $1200 and then sell it for $350? Yeah that totally helps...

Hell it could even be an inside job

Hey I dont really know a lot about this but i do run a tor exit node. Why wouldn't the victim of a MITM attack see a ssl cert error when connecting to the fake site? Or do they just switch to http instead of https?

Eh come out to palmer!  5mbps with a 70 gb cap for the low price of only $120 :p

Til of this bot, thats pretty cool!

How is this not the top comment?
@_date: 2014-06-24 10:18:54
If you look at his post history you can see he (OP) literally has made 5 comments not related to btc-plazza. 
Op is using a sensationalized title to gain attention from quite brilliant actually
@_date: 2014-06-14 09:18:19
I know this is but supporting litecoin would be awesome :P
@_date: 2014-03-16 04:06:03
Be careful, his account is only a day old, this might (probably will) make a copy of your wallet and/or install a keylogger

Hey coinfire, I havent been able to access your site for a couple of days. I tried changing browsers and everything. Something about a ssl cert error
@_date: 2014-01-29 23:00:52
Uh mtGox IS a bitcoin processor... 
@_date: 2016-03-25 23:12:20

Haha put an encrypted on on there instead, maybe put it in a folder titled "bitcoin savings account" or something like that :)

I also run a small to medium sized business. we process around 30 to 50K a month though stripe. PM me if you have any questions :)
@_date: 2015-07-06 08:08:12
Hmm i dont see a problem with creating different priorities however the last time i checked they still weren't running any ads. 
Back in HS i ran my own blog and at one point I was making a little over 1200 a month in ad revenue. With the traffic they have im guessing they could go north of 20K/ month with a two 48x48 ads on every page
@_date: 2015-07-06 08:05:46
Me too! High fives all around!
@_date: 2015-07-06 05:14:47
Hmm great find! I do know from my own personal experience that AWS is extremely expensive compared to dedicated servers. I know voat is hosted somewhere in europe where bandwidth is considerably cheaper. The cheapest longterm solution would be to purchase an entire rack from a hosting company, provide your own gear and then just pay power and bandwidth. If i remember correct you an rent a 10Gbps line form AMS-XL im amsterdam for about 1100/ month
Edit: also, most of these donations happened in the last two days, we were only at about 8Btc on friday 
@_date: 2015-09-10 20:29:23
how? I signed up in like 2013 and never got one
@_date: 2015-09-11 05:12:25
hmm well thanks for the info.im glad you got yours. mines still "processing" 19 months later 
@_date: 2015-04-12 03:11:24
So basically we give CEVo our xapo login details nd then you give us money? yep totally not a scam.
@_date: 2015-04-27 02:10:02

@_date: 2016-05-15 09:38:39
Im in the US- 
@_date: 2015-10-18 07:16:35
Most ISP's wont be cool with you using 2 tb of bandwidth a month though. 
Most would probably implement a 300 Gb per month cap like comcast does in certain areas
@_date: 2016-05-15 09:50:11
that could be. I live in alaska and us and hawaii are almost not even part of the US 
@_date: 2015-03-06 06:23:21
Dey so fucked...
@_date: 2016-05-15 05:44:28
how the hell do you get one of those? I applied like 2 years ago, then again last year and finally a few months ago. still "well notif you when your card is available"
@_date: 2015-03-14 01:09:19
You couldn't- I tried to withdraw my btc MONTHS before they disappeared and they kept wanting me to verify my account by sending them picture ID but ever AFTER complying they still rerfused to let me withdraw from my account :(
I lost north or 60 Btc and as a college student that realy hurt :(
@_date: 2016-05-18 19:38:45
I would also recommend greenaddress it has a pretty sweet user interface on pc and mobile. Ive been using them for almost 3? years now and have never had an issue. I tried out copay for a while but much prefer how greenaddress looks :)
@_date: 2015-03-26 00:18:37
Not the OP but I also requested one over a year ago and it never came :(
@_date: 2015-10-18 20:51:27
Ah yes well if you live in us US "unlimited" doesn't mean what you think it means. 
@_date: 2015-02-24 08:04:58
lol your site is down.
@_date: 2015-02-16 07:31:36
I zoomed back in until it was 100% which is stock. I just pulled it up on my desktop and it looks more normal ish.
@_date: 2015-02-16 05:58:00
I like your idea but I your site is kinda frustrating to use. Im not sure if its just my computer (13 inch macbook pro retinal) or what but the buttons are way to huge. 
Heres  what stock looks like for me 
Vs 
50% original size 
@_date: 2013-11-18 08:21:31
Are you me? I did ltc though and have around 2000 right now ($8000) enough for a decent car ;)
