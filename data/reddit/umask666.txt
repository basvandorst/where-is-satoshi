Surely this is just a central banker scheme to control us!

Ethereum is essentially a central bank, complete with its set of big corporate backers.

This conversation reminds me of why cryptoneckbeards are literally intolerable.

I really dislike this grassroots advertising for white nationalist twitter.

Looks like that c3 presentation got them on their toes lol.

Sorry I don't waste my time arguing with mouthbreathers who can't even identify the ideological currents their favorite twitter idol of the week reproduces for them.

Guessing they didn't pump and dump bcashabc to the detriment of bitcoin like Shitcoinbase did.

Coinbase is one of if not the most dangerous actors in crypto.

This book is a pretty good introduction for people new to the economic theories and the technologies behind Bitcoin.  It also, however, uncritically repeats the Austrian narrative of the origin of money (originally proposed by Carl Menger) as being a spontaneous solution to the limitations of barter.
Modern anthropology has proven though that ancient civilizations from Mesopotamia to China had, for periods of time, currency that functioned through formal and informal credit networks and were tracked via ledgers and tallies.  Coinage only came to replace these networks with rise of empires such as the Han and Rome with the need for states to remunerate their soldiers.  When the empires fell again the coinage mostly disappeared from circulation and most people returned to using credit-based currency, not a state of barter.
While this doesn't discount the consequentialist argument for sound money it does problematize the traditional, ideological explanation advanced by Austrian economists such as Ammous (and the Mises Institute scholars he's influenced by). Also, it's important not to confuse credit-based currency systems with contemporary fractional reserve ones, as credit wasn't spun out of thin air or leveraged against debt, and often borrower and lender were associates otherwise.  In addition, it was common for cultures to hold semi-ritualized events absolving all interpersonal debts once it became apparent the overall level of debt had become an obstacle to further economic growth and social cohesion.
For more information on the history of currency as a technology I highly recommend David Graeber's work *Debt: The First 5000 Years.*

Fuck this hack.

Lmao Peterson is literally regurgitating tradcath values and Joseph Campbell's mythos cycle to incels who pay him thousands of dollars every month to make them feel misunderstood instead of just pathetic.  Go read a real book you fucking crybaby.

You say this as if it's a bad thing.
@_date: 2018-12-31 03:45:08
Do Peterson stans have anything else to do other than spamming every single article about this to r/Bitcoin for days at a time?

This isn't true, non-mining nodes simply relay and transmit blocks and transactions as well as seed the blockchain as is to new peers.  51% attacks only need that much of the current hash power, validating nodes have no input on the overall consensus of the chain except via their propagation of new blocks.
