This topic may have been discussed before but, what would be necessary for Bitcoin to replace current fund transfer institutions like Western Union ? (I know this one is used a lot for european / north african fund transfers)

Laws, judges and lawyers in France are still following some customs from the middle ages. Even if they someday grasp the concept of Bitcoins they'll never have much more than a ridiculous and useless response, like Hadopi for illegal downloads.

French reddior here: this text seems to apply only to France's public postal service. It says nothing about other shipping companies (Fedex, UPS, etc) and seems to be aimed specifically at currencies.

Isn't that exactly what the NSA is already doing ?

"We accept Bitcoin but we don't endorse it". If it wasn't so confusing, I'd say it's completely cynical.
