A large number of the Islamic scholars do like bitcoin and even larger number dislike fiat.

[Some Norwegian guy]( apparently.

This, I can't imagine how to make bitcoin as convenient as physical cash when making irl purchases.

I would assume by having a separate wallet for spending small amounts.

So it wouldn't be sad if it was destroyed by a not pro-Western government? I don't understand your logic.

Your barknormativity is problematic.

Literally who and why should I care?
[Here]( is a direct link to his article anyway since it is probably more informative than some tweet.

I would be more interested in knowing which secular law makes it illegal.

What is so generous about purchasing legal goods? I don't feel particularly generous when I use my money to buy food instead of dope.

Why? Maybe they are just willing to pay extra to avoid all the bullshit banks bring with them.

Unfortunately mostly yes, the problem is that doing journalism with integrity and intellectual honesty doesn't pay but creates a lot of enemies.

Maybe it is just different how banks work in the US. WU rarely cares about the details of the transaction but EU banks always freak out when they see a transaction they consider abnormal.

People saying that communism is represented by the 10 planks make absolutely no sense. 
I don't want to defend communism but even Marx himself criticized these ten items later in his career and called them antiquated. He especially emphasized that these ideas were inherently related to the historical and technological conditions which existed around the time of writing. Also if you read the paragraphs before the part you quoted, you would understand that these are just measures to change the mode of production and this change will eventually lead to the abolition of state.
There are a lot of good arguments against communism so stop using the bad ones.

Why obsolete? Both a trezor and a ledger are obviously wallets and would be among the first things to be confiscated/stolen if a malicious party has physical access to them. Simply having one would make you an obvious cryptocurrency user which might be bad depending on the circumstances. Paper wallets on the other hand can be easily disguised so I still can imagine multiple use cases for them.

Might as well use fiat in this case.

Hi Oliver, it is your elderly relative here and I lost this key you gave me a year earlier. Can you ask the bank to restore the password? I would like to invest those coins in this handy application which doubles my wealth.
@_date: 2019-02-13 08:17:40
US only.

Apparently not that obvious given the replies.
