This guy Mnuchin states that they will regulate ALL entities dealing with cryptocurrency transactions using the same standards that they use today for banks. Wow is he in for a surprise with Atomic Swaps and true DEXs on the near horizon.

5. He/she/they are simply very principled people who don't feel that money is the most important thing in life.
One theory out there, although a distant possibility in my mind, is that Julian Assange is Satoshi.

No, I don't think he does. For example my boss at work started his business when he was 25 years old. By the time he was 40 his company was valued at 400 million Euros. That same boss is now 85 years old. He still comes to work everyday. He stopped caring about his personal money after he got enough money to lead a comfortable life. What my boss cares about really is making a difference in the world and leaving his "footprints in the sand of humanity" as he says.

Because Satoshi realized that those few who control the money/financial system, also control the world. Remember Bitcoin was born just after the great financial depression of 2008. The few in control (big banks, big governments)  messed up badly but were mostly considered too big to fail. So they got bail outs. Hence the few in control survived while the majority had to pay to bail them out. A payment system isn't just about money per say, but rather the control and lack of freedom that comes with it.

Can we pay with Bitcoin on CheapAir directly from a cyptocurrency exchange ? For example if I buy Bitcoin on an exchange, can I send the Bitcoin for a flight payment directly to CheapAir from that exchange, and not bother going to my own personal wallet first ? Thanks !

Just to finish the story, it remained a federal felony to own gold by Americans until 1977 when president Ford signed proclamation.

Thanks for the reply. A second question please. Can I send the BTC to Cheapair from a hardware wallet like a Nano Ledger ? In otherwords, can I send the BTC from a wallet that does not use Payment Protocol BIP-70 ? Thanks again !
@_date: 2018-10-01 03:25:48
Commas and decimal points are too confusing for thousand separators as the notation changes depending on which country you live. I suggest we stick with the metric separator which is simple a space. So for example you number above would be written as 13 790 000,0. I used a comma for the decimal point as decimal points can easily be overlooked. Just my suggestion.
@_date: 2018-10-05 02:22:09
Can you send the BTC directly to Cheapair from an exchange ? Or do you have to use a few certain special wallets that incorporate the Payment Protocol BIP-70 ?
@_date: 2019-06-29 21:59:10
Wrong. Paper wallets are the safest way to store your coins but you must use them properly. As for the Ledger Nano. it is not open source, so I would not recommend it. Trezor is open source, but I have never tried it.
@_date: 2019-08-25 02:04:22
Good for you ! Safety first. Always verify and decode an offline generated Bitcoin transaction offline before broadcasting it. Here are some offline tools that will work,
[Coinb.in]( run it offline. Use the verify tab to decode your signed Bitcoin transaction.
Also BlockCypher, [BTC.com]( and [blockchain.com]( offer this capability, but I do not know if they work offline.
@_date: 2019-08-05 02:31:59
Agreed, sort of. This guys big mistake was not studying the evolution of none fiat currencies. To paraphrase the economist Jevons: Stage 1 - a collectable (uniqueness), Stage 2 - a store of value, Stage 3 - a currency, Stage 4 - a unit of account. Simply put, nothing can jump to stage 3, a currency, without first becoming a collectable and then a store of value. Bitcoin looks like is in now moving from stage 1 to stage 2. Fiat goes straight to stage 3 as a currency by decree and as such is bound to fail since it has no store of value property.
@_date: 2019-08-26 00:59:59
You can and should verify the transaction offline first before you put it online. For example [Coinb.in]( is a wallet that functions offline and has a verify tab where you can paste your transaction and verify it offline before going online with it. There are other offline verifiers/decoders as well. If something is strange with the transaction, it will show up in the decoding.
@_date: 2019-02-14 22:11:58
Nope, the US sanction did.
@_date: 2019-06-20 23:30:03


No ! Please never sweep a paper wallet into an online wallet. You could be phished (always assume you WILL be phished). Use the private key of your paper wallet to sign the Bitcoin transaction on an offline computer. Then while your still offline use the VERIFY function to verify the transaction in a human readable form to ensure the transaction will do exactly what you want it to do. Once the transaction is verified by you offline, then and only then, you can transfer the transaction to an online computer and broadcast the transaction. Please never put your private key online. Stay safe.
@_date: 2019-06-30 01:44:58
The Wiki page is wrong. Paper wallets are completely safe if made properly. Yes agreed they are tricky to use safely, but not over bearing. I have nothing against seed phrases except that if they are compromised, then all the keys generated from the phrase are compromised. Generating individual paper wallet allows one key to be compromised without compromising all of the individual keys.
@_date: 2019-06-02 21:49:51
There are many tools for this. Check out Coinb.in for example. If you use it, use one computer online to retrieve your current information and the other computer off line. And only download Coinb.in from the Github page. Lastly, make sure you verify your transaction offline as well before you broadcast it, to make sure you haven't signed something that is wrong or malicious.

I'm no fan of socialism. But socialism did not kill the Venezuelan economy. The economic war waged by the US on Venezuela in the form of sanctions has killed the Venezuelan economy. China is for example is a socialist country (call it communism with a market economy if you like). China has been very successful in developing their economy over the last 30 years. Their socialist system works VERY well for them and its part of their culture and way of life. Again, I'm not a fan of socialism, its not for me, its not my culture and its not for my country. I completely reject socialism. But socialism can work in countries if it is part of their culture as China shows us.

Who says Venezuela can't feed their population ? That's wrong. I spoke to friends just the other day in Venezuela. They have no problems feeding themselves. If you don't believe me, see the below videos from Dash in Venezuela ordering food in Venezuela. 
The economic warfare waged by the US through sanctions on Venezuela has killed their economy over the last 10 years. Its even stated in a recent congressional report that, "For more than a decade, the United States has employed sanctions as a policy tool in response to activities of the Venezuelan government or Venezuelan individuals". It was around 2009 when the Venezuelan economy really started its downward trend, 10 years ago.
Socialism works fine in China and Norway for example. Its their culture. Again, I'm not a fan of socialism, its not for me, but it can work if it belongs to the culture of the people in a country.

Its really easy, no command-line expertise. If you use the Electrum wallet for example they give you step by step instructions at the below link. If you do not want to use Electrum there are other such wallets like Coinb.in that can do it also. It is easy and safe. Remember to Verify your transaction offline before you send it, to make sure you haven't signed something malicious. Again there are several Bitcoin transaction verifiers that work offline. You just paste in your raw transaction offline (no broadcasting) and review it. Then after you agree that everything is proper, you can broadcast the transaction. Stay safe.
@_date: 2019-04-25 02:54:45
They are most likely safe. To be sure they are safe, I suggest going through the source code that was used to generate the paper wallet to ensure nothing funny was going on (hopefully you still have that old source code). That is more than you can do than say with a Ledger hardware wallet which is not open source. But if the code you have was malicious, someone would probably have stolen your coins by now anyway. You can also verify your private keys do work for your public address by signing a Bitcoin message on an offline air gaped computer that will never ever go online again.
@_date: 2019-04-10 21:34:07
I would give that a definite maybe :) You may have heard some economists talk about a cliff scenario which I think is what you mean. If interest rates get too low, people will get greedy and take zero interest "free money". That will quickly spiral out of control and force central bankers to rapidly raise interest rates to calm the situation. Its certain possible. But it didn't happen in Japan over the last 20 years. And its not happening in the EU now.  So for at least the next few years, I think we are headed for global zero and even negative interest rates.
@_date: 2019-04-10 19:20:37
I am with you when you say the writing is on the wall. But I'm not so certain hyperinflation is coming. Most developed countries right now have the opposite problem, very low inflation. So to try an stimulate lending and some inflation, central bankers lower interest rates. In Japan interest rates have been near zero or negative for about 20 years. In Sweden and Switzerland we now have negative interest rates. The EU has zero interest rates. If lending can be stimulated, then more money is created which central bankers think is good up to a point, until inflation really takes off. So what happens now where we sit currently ? Other countries like the US and Canada likely head back down to zero interest rates again joining the EU and Japan. China probably comes down with interests rates also. Then the worlds economies are stuck with zero interest rates (or negative) and no growth for a very long time. Remember when interest rates are zero, the old saying "inflation is a debtors friend" does not hold, and the world economies stagnate with sub 1% GDP growth. Anyway, just my 2 cents and an alternative view. I think we are headed for a very long period of very low world economic growth and low inflation.

I disagree. A paper wallet made offline on an air gaped computer that will never be on the internet is the safest form of storage. Furthermore, the code being used to make the paper wallet should be reviewed in great detail to make sure it is proper. 
@_date: 2019-01-13 03:07:27
I wasn't talking about buying from third parties. You can buy direct from Ledger or Trezor. But how does the hard ware wallet get to you then ? Using Fedex or DHL or another delivery service. Every person along the delivery route get their hands on your hard ware wallet. Better hope those people don't compromise your wallet during shipping.
@_date: 2019-01-19 23:50:36
With regard to punctuation, sorry. Reddit reformatted my comment including changing the spacing where I had hit enter. Anyways, where to start. Firstly, paper wallets do not need a hardware wallet or software wallet to be spent. I have my own offline transaction generator which I partially wrote (and partially copied). I use it from an offline air gaped computer to sign my transactions when sweeping a paper wallet. My private key is never exposed to an online computer. Anyone can find such offline transaction signing tools from several Github locations and review the code in detail to ensure its good. With regards to hardware wallets, yes the video does indeed give a summary of issues currently being faced. And yes, they keep getting fixed as you state, but hopefully not too late before others have their seed compromised. One big issue with hardware wallets is that the source code for Ledger is not open source (to my knowledge) although I believe Trezor is open. Even so, that code is very complicated for a simpleton like me to review and have confidence in. For my paper wallet generator, I spent about 3 days reviewing the code to ensure I felt safe using it. And address reuse is not an issue for paper wallets, it is a feature. That is why we have the phase to "sweep a paper wallet", all of it must be swept. Lastly, I'm not try to convince you or anyone else of anything. I do also use software and hardware wallets but only for smaller amounts. The fact is that paper wallets IF used properly are the safest means of storage.

Summary below, pitfalls of a hardware wallet like Ledger or Tresor from Wallet.fail video
Summary below, pitfall of a hot wallet like Electrum
Paper wallets if used properly and the code if verified by the user are by far the best and safest method to store crypto.

Get yourself an offline air gaped computer. Then put the wallet Coinbin on that offline air gaped computer. Make sure that the computer is offline, air gaped, and will NEVER EVER go on the internet again in the future. NEVER. Then on the offline air gaped computer where you have Coinbin, you can input your private key. It will give you the Bitcoin public address. The public address will start with a "1". You can then type that public address in to a bitcoin block explorer on an online computer. That will tell you how many BTC you have at that address.
Now if you want to move those Bitcoins then you can use the offline computer with Coinbin to create and sign an offline transaction. Once signed the transaction should be verified offline to make sure that transaction will do exactly what you want it to do. If its good and you verified it will do what you want, then the transaction can be broadcast on the online computer later.
Alternatively, instead of the Coinbin wallet, the Bitcoin Electrum wallet also has offline signing capabilities. They called it a watch wallet and cold storage signing. It is very easy to setup and instructions are online.
Most importantly, NEVER NEVER put the private key into an online computer. There are too many phising sites and key logger or screen capture viruses floating around. Stay safe.
@_date: 2019-05-28 02:18:26
As an alternative, you could use a BIP39 Mnemonic code converter tool such as shown below in the video. This tool must ONLY be used on an offline air gaped computer that will NEVER never be on the internet again. This tools lets you ensure that the pubic addresses you are creating with your wallet match exactly those that the offline tool predicts you will and hence confirming your wallet is good. Furthermore, you will know that in case something happens with your wallet, that this offline tool will give you your private keys, if you ever need them.

I'm OK with Bitcoin being less of a currency at the moment. A store of value would be fine until the tech advances, for example lightning network. As a store of value though, from 20 k to 3.7 k in price is not good. That said however, the so called "ultimate store of value" gold, has gone from about 1.8 k per ounce to 1.2 k over the past 7 years. Also a poor return, and hence not a store of value.
@_date: 2018-12-20 23:18:13
This - exactly. I can sweep a paper wallet by generating a transaction on an offline air gaped computer in less than 2 minutes and then broadcasting on an online computer. It has never failed me.

About 2 years ago I setup a verbal password with my mobile phone provider. Since then anytime I have called my phone provider to ask a billing question or requested to make changes to my account, the provider always first asked me to verify my verbal password. I'm sure its not a perfect system and maybe a good talker could still get through the phone service representative to my account, but its still better than nothing. And yes, not your keys not your coins. Don't leave large sums on exchanges.
@_date: 2018-12-05 23:59:12
Thanks, very nice. It looks like most of the Bitcoin large trades are happening on Bitmex. I'm guessing this has to do with peoples long or short contracts getting filled on Bitmex. I will look at this site again during the next major Bitcoin price move.
@_date: 2018-12-26 03:13:23
Nope. With lightning the transfer hops sometimes between several nodes before it finds the end. This means the in between nodes are handling the transfer and they are not KYC. Maybe in the future some kind of direct lightning link could be setup between CB and other popular exchanges to avoid in between hops but thats farther out. CB will never run the risk of violating AML/KYC and always error on the conservative side.
@_date: 2018-12-30 22:27:19
Really ? And how did you get your Ledger or Trezor ? In the mail ? Fedex ? DHL ? Lots of unknown people got their hands on your hardware wallet during transit from the supplier. Better hope you don't have a corrupt one, as shown in the video. It would be horrible to find out 2 years from now that your hardware wallet was compromised during shipping. Stay safe !

The 2nd one mostly from what I have been able to find. The Bcash team did a very good coordinated spam attack job.

I used to also think the same thing until I dug a little deeper. Now I'm convinced it will not happen for a long time. Coinbase is a regulated exchange with KYC mandatory. Lightning, with its hops to and from unknown not KYC entities, would disqualify its use on Coinbase or any other regulated exchange.
