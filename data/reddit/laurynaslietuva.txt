You didn't answer my question, but thanks anyway =)
@_date: 2016-08-19 08:59:55
Thanks, I'll do that !
@_date: 2016-08-18 09:17:20
Yeah, but is it possible to earn 1 BTC or more per year?

if(array_key_exists("p", $_GET) &amp;&amp; in_array($_GET["p"], ["admin", "password-reset"])) {    something is wrong with this
@_date: 2016-08-18 09:30:22
Good for you! =)
@_date: 2017-03-29 11:17:31
thanks you very much! :)
@_date: 2017-03-29 11:17:37
thanks :)
@_date: 2017-04-21 18:36:42
Amazing! Looking forward for it being activated!
@_date: 2017-05-09 15:13:29
I'll check it out, but is there any other way? Like for example accepting altcoins?
@_date: 2017-05-09 15:34:39
@_date: 2017-05-09 15:29:10
could you provide me some documentation on how to do it ? :)
@_date: 2016-07-30 19:17:44
Thanks bro :) Would it be efficient or at least possible to earn 15 USD by using faucets, or anything similar?
@_date: 2016-07-31 06:22:05
Ok, thanks.

I don't know, I live in Lithuania and I'm 14.

No, my dad said that he would be running at his place (work) for free, he doesn't need to pay for electricity. Well I don't have a lot of money, but I could buy Bitcoins with them, but my parents don't trust Bitcoin itself and they say buying it is risky and probably a scam.

Yeah, but that's the thing, I won't place any ads, the faucet will be donation based. You would earn about 0,50 USD every 12 hours or more than 0,50 USD
@_date: 2016-07-31 06:21:34
Thanks, they now understand it :)
@_date: 2016-07-20 15:55:01
Oh and guys what is the minimum age to use blogspot?
@_date: 2016-07-20 16:00:17
Sorry I did the math wrong :D I meant 0,50 USD every 12 hours or more than 0,50 USD
@_date: 2016-07-20 14:52:12
Yeah , but the domain i'm hosting will have my name and other details, so legal or not then?
