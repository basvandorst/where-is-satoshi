Man I honestly think gdax has the best price monitoring interface out there but I just can't put my cryptos into it after how shitty coinbase handled the bcash addition. I'm using gemini to buy/sell and gdax to monitor right now

@_date: 2018-01-06 00:04:03
I'm thinking sell now and buy next dip, anyone else stratting like this? 
@_date: 2018-01-06 00:48:31
What is the best exchange to do that on? I currently use gemini

So I can buy the dip 
@_date: 2019-07-02 17:55:16
I'm guessing its going to be around $420,000.69

Recently sold all my ltc for btc, is there any reason to hold ltc right now? It seems like it's not good to take on the long especially with btc looking at adapting the lightning network. Am I wrong?

What does this actually mean? 
@_date: 2017-12-27 01:56:44
I have about 2k worth of btc stuck on gdax. Instead of paying a ridiculous fee to transfer to gemini, I'm just going to cash out and buy the next dip. Thoughts on this approach? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:30:06
Okay ill admit I was tempted at 13k but promised myself I would until 10k
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:30:40
BUY BUY BUY (queue nysnc song) 
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:23:47
All those people who bought in after the hype are seeing the dip and selling cause they are scared 
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:21:55
How many of you C H E E K Y  C U N T S are buying the dip? 
@_date: 2017-12-27 02:11:59
Really? Why don't they have any fees? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:34:22
This is what I'm thinking, I think we will see CME bet against btc on Monday and the price will correct 
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:42:54
I'm guessing after, I think wall street is secretly pumping right now only to bet against it on CME this Monday
Edit - It's CBOE futures on the 10th and CME on the 17th

This cannot be right? Free to transfer from gdax to coinbase maybe but not another wallet. Am I wrong? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:01:57
I think wall street is pumping before futures open on CME Monday so they can bet against it. But honestly, we don't really know

broooo its prob illumati or paid shills I bet
@_date: 2017-03-07 18:38:06
As a casual reader, none of the toxicity I have seen comes from people not being allowed to speak openly. It's "I'm right youre wrong" in every thread on r/bitcoin and then reading r/btc is even more of the same with an addition fuck r/bitcoin amiright?  Honestly one of the most toxic communities I've visited on reddit
@_date: 2017-03-07 17:07:36
Isn't literally any bank also susceptible to these backdoors as well?  Not just a bitcoin thing

Again, from the sidebar this time:


@_date: 2017-11-15 17:05:58
Well yea, they are actively buying ads to display on r/bitcoin and are a generally butthurt community whenever you talk negative about bcash but r/bitcoin is just memeing to the moon.
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:01:37
I mean, did you actually read the sidebar rules?


@_date: 2017-11-21 03:37:52
I'm just here for the dank memes and shit posts 
@_date: 2017-11-09 03:41:54
That's not true at all, I have been following both subs for some time now and r/btc is way more harsh. Say anything bad and it's downvoted to oblivion immediately. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 02:15:50
Or help someone understand. This is forum for understanding 
@_date: 2017-11-27 02:35:14
Whatever works for your budget. I personally did bits and pieces 
@_date: 2017-11-09 04:01:13
Again, that's false. Go over there and mention something negative about bch. Seriously, I was called a dumb ass cause i didn't think bch would survive in the long run. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 03:43:28
I come here for the shit posts 
@_date: 2017-11-10 15:59:59
man I sipped the r/btc koolaid for awhile but ever since they started pushing bch it actually seems like they are the ones with a "bitcoin" agenda they are spoonfeeding to their community

Ehh I dunno man, are most people who own bitcoin enthusiasts? Or are they just hodling as long as it has value?

@_date: 2017-11-21 03:38:49
I come here for the shit posts, maybe it makes more sense to have a daily discussion thread 
@_date: 2017-11-09 03:39:50
It's really bad over there , bring up anything about bitcoin or question bch and you are immediately called a troll 
@_date: 2018-02-10 01:56:40
did anyone here use bitcoin.tax to do their taxes? if so was it worth it?
@_date: 2018-02-11 19:58:56
HAs anyone used bitcoin.tax to figure out their capital gains?  I want to make sure its worth it before I buy.  I had transactions on gemini, gdax and coinbase which it supports
@_date: 2017-10-06 17:55:58
Why are people trashing this? if they want to branch off and be successful that's good for crypto in general, right?
@_date: 2017-10-07 02:45:40
Why do people hate BCH? what if both BTC and BCH went to the moon? I sold all my BCH early but man it would be awesome if crypto took off like that 
@_date: 2017-10-21 17:48:43
I have been following both this sub and r/btc for awhile now and while both bash each other, r/btc seems to be pretty obsessed with this sub. It comes up in almost every thread how bad this sub is and how everything is censored
@_date: 2017-10-21 18:10:12
Wow that's actually kinda funny they take it so personally
@_date: 2017-10-21 17:50:30
do people really get butthurt over that?
@_date: 2017-07-28 03:58:00

12:07 - still down - kinda shitty they have no official message on their twitter OR blog
12:19 - no dice

Play it safe by moving to my own wallet or keeping it in a wallet like coinbase or gemini?

Ahh thanks! It looks like they don't show that info on mobile.

So the spike in segwit blocks is signaling that segwit is going to happen.(does this mean a hardfork of segwit 2x?)

It's also really sad how obsessed they are with this sub. You can't find a thread where they don't mention r/bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-07-28 01:17:09
Ahh okay I wasn't sure how that worked, that clarifies the first part for me thanks. 
@_date: 2017-07-19 17:03:01
Wouldn't this move increase the amount of mining pools signaling 2x?  This is a key player in the market, and if they are saying they wont support a certain fork, other mining pools are more likely to fall in line so that bitcoin holds its value.
