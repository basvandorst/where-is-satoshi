It's a good idea to "ride the buzz wave" but it will cost them more than they've planned

People that shout bubble are usually the once that had the chance to get in the game but missed it, and now they are green with envy. And, there will be always people like that, so don't hold your breath with expectations to have them stop shouting "it's a bubble"

I don't think you can have it all. But if to consider the last item on your list, "located in USA", you might want to try Coinbase: it has great reputation and it's secured. Limits might be an issue, but you can check that yourself.

I would not go so far as to "never used", but yeh, as long as the value keep climbing, it would be harder for owners to part of their precious digital gold. This, by the way, is one of the Bitcoins drawbacks when it comes to getting it to be used in mainstream.

well, credibility is something that is the most important to me, hence the hassle you described. Don't use gemini, not enough liquidity and alts options, so I can't really say

I bet there are more cases like these. Excellent karma!!
