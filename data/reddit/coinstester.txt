coinbase pays the transaction fee since its launch. For other exchanges, they charge a different fee from your balance. On all personal wallets, you need to set fee for withdrawal. While sending from blockchain.info, select custom from the left, and set the fee you want to.

Hi, I have done this survey. I also listed some missing options in your list of questions. I missed to convey one point in the survey.
The last textbox before the finish survey button asking about "what do you want to say about this survey?" - The textbox is a single line box, make it a big text box and allow more paragraphs to be written.
Good survey. Good luck.
Will be sharing your tweets too. Done. Wow 690+ responses so far. Tough contest.

Edit : Included.

[Note : First version is done. The post has some spell/grammar errors. Sorry for that.]
**First :**
I wish you great success with fiatleak. I believe you have come in a right place for perfect brainstorming.
I already have seen some great suggestions from a lot of people above. 
I don't know much about bitcoin. I'm still a fresh learner everyday. 
However, I asked a question to me "What should I need from fiatleak if I'm a user, developer, investor, trader, firm?" and interpreted myself to come with some points.
This is a very short list. I need to say something more if I get enough help.
Excuse me, if I have written something you already have, or suggestions from people posted above and below. 
I might add/edit the post if I strike a new point or express a listed point in more clear way. 
I don't know if my points are worth to read and reward according to your brainstorming needs. However, I expressed myself.
Finally I wish a great prosperous new year wishes. Thanks. Moving into discussions now :
**Basic information**
What should you know? Explain to just a user, a developer, an investor, a company, alien levels.
Wiki must include basic information about bitcoin. History of bitcoin, recent developments, criticisms, controversies and different testing implementations and the adapted techniques one by one. You can easily link to existing wiki. However, a fiatleak wiki in a much approached way to target the visitor can attract more people and works well overtime. 
You need to update it often as things are changing rapidly. You can also host debates,AMAs and ask people to post their questions, suggestions. You can also try to answer the questions. This will get you return visitors. 
**Honor your visitors**
Illustrations, Wiki are not quite enough. After every page/topic/tutorial/video/illustration/visual/debate/AMA/etc., you can host a quiz and reward people.
You can reward users in different means :
* Award currency - bitcoin, any altcoin, Fiatleak altcoin (if you wish to create).
* Badges - Award bitcoin badges who pass quizzes. As you know, you can fix the level a beginner/expert/developer/pro. You can also let him/her link a fiatleak badge to his/her blog or affix in his/her firm.
* Certification - You can turn into a training institute and start certifying people by treating your quizzes are real tests. You can also earn great reputation in the marketplace. If you're intended to so, this will be a lot of work for you and you need to include programming resources for bitcoin.
* From time to time and on special days/occasions you can host mega contests, get sponsors and award visitors. It can get your site keep visited. I don't intend it for marketing and your growth. You need to do it wisely by not making people mistakenly think about a lottery site. You can award Hardware wallets, Desktops/Laptops, Mining hashes, Free courses, tickets to next to happen tech thans/stalls/etc., 
[Note: You can also get sponsors for quizzes. Let them award people]
**Physical bitcoins** - What is it? Who is making? Can you make one? How it can be traded? + information
**Plus** 
* Videos, pdfs, handouts, Memes, cartoons will help new people who learn things differently.
* Ask visitors **"Can you live with bitcoin?"** Then take them to virtual home/office/marketplace and visually illustrate how can they live with bitcoin. Let them visually and virtually (really also) make purchases, spendings, book orders, reserve suits, lease, start a firm, pay employees, tip people, pay taxes and else in bitcoin. 
* This includes selling for bitcoin, spending for bitcoin, working for bitcoin and many more. You need to brainstorm for a lot of time to get a clear script of what you're going to say here. 
* Virtual tour helps people realize bitcoin usage and a vital addition to fiatleak.
[Note : Source real offers from merchants and let people use in realtime inside visuals. You can also let people use coupons. A great marketplace ahead. Brainstorming will unveil more. I will put a ... here]
* You can try to get great artworks, animations+sounds to show the walk of the life. While illustrating these things, you can include references to live websites, merchants and other setups to make the visitor feel the reality. 
[Note: You can also charge PPM, PPC from them as you're practically advertising while visually preparing newcomers to adapt to bitcoin.]
* You can also ask the people/visitor to post their own views/artworks/visuals/illustrations/blogs that leads to basic understanding, usage and implications of bitcoin at various levels. 
[Note : An SEO healthy link from their own blogs can get you load of visitors daily and make fiatleak one of the imminent website to source information about bitcoin. Long way to go]
**Fiatleak Platform**
**[The fiatleak website/platform must be view complaint on all platforms existing. Desktop, Tabs, Mobiles etc.,]**
Create a fiatleak platform exclusive for your visitors to explore all the possibilities in one screen. 
The platform must be a fully complied great source of information for bitcoiners.
Help people to get tickers, live update links, other stuff that they can stick to their website.
Make fiatleak platform as most advanced information provider in terms bitcoin transactions.
You may include :












Let users to customize the listings, so that he can visualize according to his/her mind needs. You need to consider a forex professional's point of view.
[Note : Upon success, extend the same to all altcoins that you wish to include]
**Price charts**
I think this is simple. Include price charts similar to trendingview and let people to work on it if they wish to find out trading stuff. This would turn fiatleak into a great platform.
Include calculators. This will help viewers to estimate their profit/loss or make decisions about their next moves. These calculators must also include mining, trading, lending, forex calcs if needed.
Public spending price alerts [I think some users may have suggested it.]
A robust update 24x7 in a page/link that helps users to know about bitcoin support providers in terms of :




[Note : I wish to have a detailed customizable list based on countrywise, statewise, popularity, Newly included and many other criteria]
**Regulatory/Banking rules for all countries**
Prepare a great list of information about laws and regulations in each country and add it to fiatleak. Let the users customize and view the regulations and rules they have to follow for their country.
**Tax Implications**
List tax implications for all countries
[Note : Here you can seek country wise law, taxmen to get information to list in the concerned country pages. You can turn into a great law, taxmen board to interact with their country men to deal bitcoins. This will help people who startup a crypto firm, project or wish to do business.
Make it customizable.
Host AMAs, run request campaign for regulators if people need it. Lot can be done. Brainstorm helps.]
**Customizable Richlists**
Let the user set his/her own criteria. Countrywise richlist of bitcoin holders on a particular year, date, month. Currency wise richlist of bitcoin holders + some other criteria. etc., etc., and etc., 
**Fiatleak API**
Help visitors get use of fiatleak platform and other stuff programmatically by creating compelling API that supports integration a variety of levels. This includes simply linking to their blogs/websites, business analytics.

**Fiatleak Cryptocurrency**
* Issue Fiatleak Altcoin and tip the visitors, shares your site. Good exposure for btc and good for fiatleak too.
* You can also issue fiatleak shares. Get Partner firms.
