Worth is relative. What is worth more to me, $1,000 cash or a pile of rocks valued at $1,500? While the rocks may have "real" value as products, the $1,000 cash is "worth" more to me because it's value lies in what I can do with it easily. A product may be more valuable but worth less to me because it lacks any sort of liquidity. 
So the question is, where is the worth in BTC? The answer is simple enough of it look at the language people use to describe the worth. The bulk of the posts here talk about one thing: The BTC to USD exchange rate. The worth of BTC lies in how much USD it can be converted into because BTC has next to no worth if it can't be converted into USD which does have real value. Real not in the sense that it is intrinsically useful but because it can be used to buy anything. BTC does not come close to that sort of real value. 
So you see, if most countries ban exchanges, BTC loses most of its value derived from its ability to be liquidated for an asset that can actually be used to buy most things.

Literally everybody in the world does that with some frequency.

So the people that bought BTC at $1 and have been sitting on their hoard for years have been using them the way they were meant to be used?

2.3 million making 5% is $115,000/yr. You couldn't retire comfortably on that?

Because what people care about is growth. Japan's GDP growth is flat and has been for years. The absolute magnitude of an economy doesn't really matter to an investor.

Because whenever anybody talks about BTC, they reference its "worth" and that "worth" is it's exchange rate to USD or another currency. BTC currently has next to no real worth outside of its ability to become liquid through exchanges.

The linking to Wikipedia made me laugh.
