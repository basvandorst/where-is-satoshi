Nice! Now deposit in Coinbase.
@_date: 2018-01-07 06:57:32
So a monopoly!?
@_date: 2018-01-14 15:50:22
Iron Mike!!!

Brian Kelly says; don’t rekt yourself.

@_date: 2018-01-04 07:50:37
This is weird. Coinbase asking for employer verification.
@_date: 2018-01-01 04:02:42
Binance. Bitstamp.
I know a lot (17) of ���� that use those two.
@_date: 2018-01-01 04:00:41
You don’t want to buy from an exchange?
@_date: 2018-01-23 06:24:46
@_date: 2018-01-11 06:20:40
It was a not-so-subtle jab.
@_date: 2018-01-26 02:46:51
Quite possible. Stay tuned.
@_date: 2018-01-14 03:34:13
I concur.
@_date: 2018-01-04 16:34:20
Hahaha. That’s funny.

Jamie Dimon reports to a board. That board is elected by shareholders. Crypto-currency is a potentially multi-billion dollar piece of business for JP Morgan. What do you think will happen to Jamie Dimon if he tries to stop the company from participating?
Is he personally invested in this space? Probably not.
@_date: 2018-01-18 04:30:22
Government regulation is much wider than just taxes. I was referring to the legal aspect that pertain to the relationship between the banking industry and crypto securities.
Not really sure what your “not really” was pertaining to.
@_date: 2018-01-31 05:42:33
I’ve been looking for this.
@_date: 2018-01-13 20:27:44
What about ETH or LTC?
@_date: 2018-01-01 03:57:49
Nigerian Princes are also real.
@_date: 2018-01-01 03:59:08
What’s the name of that place?
@_date: 2018-01-11 12:26:56
@_date: 2018-01-09 20:53:02
Hmmmm. Did you read the article?
@_date: 2018-01-10 04:33:47
You mean like a steak knife?
@_date: 2018-01-17 22:21:12
The ONLY thing stopping them is the uncertainty about government regulation. US banks create financial instruments (CMOs, CDOs, etc.) that destroy countries and make them billions in profits so trust me, they’re not sitting on the sidelines because they want to.
@_date: 2018-01-01 04:01:24
Can’t wait!!!
@_date: 2018-01-04 07:43:52
Huh? Which sites are those?
@_date: 2018-01-21 16:26:23
This is not exactly a reliable source.
@_date: 2018-01-02 01:38:49
You can just leave it open as an emergency account.
@_date: 2018-01-07 06:58:22
Hahahha. No way!
@_date: 2018-01-07 06:58:50
...if you expect to wait for three to four weeks then yeah.
@_date: 2018-01-03 03:34:30
What exactly did he say that makes you think he’s now a Bitcoin supporter?
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:05:35
Haha. I’m from New York so we don’t really use that term. We have a tendency of being much harsher.
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:04:48
Damn! That’s such a coincidence.
@_date: 2017-12-21 07:21:41
Wise words!
@_date: 2017-12-16 05:15:13
I couldn’t agree more. However, technically, futures is supposed to reduce volatility so it has been effective.
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:05:18
Buyer beware.
@_date: 2017-12-17 04:12:51
You said it’s possible. Care to state why?
@_date: 2017-12-21 06:22:31
And it’s so clear what his intentions where in that CNBC interview.
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:05:59
@_date: 2017-12-18 19:19:15
I would love to know the answer as well.
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:01:10
@_date: 2017-12-17 04:46:42
It does take some time. It can take days.
@_date: 2017-12-19 08:57:30
Schwab or Buffet?
@_date: 2017-12-25 08:06:23
@_date: 2017-12-17 07:26:44
Same here.
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:04:59
That’s actually a very big price discrepancy. I strongly recommend each and everyone of you to not be beholden to one exchange. I use Coinbase, Gemini, Binance and Bitstamp.
Gemini is my primary account.
Coinbase is constantly with the shenanigans.
@_date: 2017-12-16 08:34:37
1). Lol. Thanks. Now it makes sense.
2). Yep. Financial advisor here with over fifteen years in the financial markets. I just wanted to let the others know how important capital gains taxes are.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:14:58
Yep. Same here.
@_date: 2017-12-16 10:58:55
Wait for the institutional investors.
@_date: 2017-12-18 19:18:28
@_date: 2017-12-23 03:17:39
...or they can just be much more transparent.
@_date: 2017-12-19 00:37:46
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:30:54
I’m confused by these service businesses being absolutely terrible at...service.
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:03:27
Change BCC to BCH. It’s slightly confusing.
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:03:56
Ready for 
@_date: 2017-12-21 09:45:25
Hold my beer....didn’t Roger spend 10 months in a Federal prison for selling explosives online?
@_date: 2017-12-17 02:45:57
In that case; I know a couple good tax lawyers.
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:19:47
He went on CNBC and roasted ALL Bitcoin developers.
@_date: 2017-12-25 08:09:49
It’s not “cancer”. They just have horrible customer service and too many system failures that cost real people real money. So no, not cancer....but very very bad as of now.
@_date: 2017-12-18 07:07:56
I would like that information as well.
@_date: 2017-12-17 02:16:14
Define a lot.
@_date: 2017-12-25 21:59:11
That can’t even buy 25% of a Bitcoin. RIP.
@_date: 2017-12-17 02:03:16
I think it will dip a little and then spike.
@_date: 2017-12-19 02:06:13
No problem.
@_date: 2017-12-17 02:40:29
Second that.
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:27:21
@_date: 2017-12-17 03:15:09
When did you start buying?

@_date: 2017-12-23 06:52:58
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:27:33
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:56:40
Oh ok. Thanks for clarifying.
@_date: 2017-12-25 20:50:18
Any bank accounts you have on Coinbase are automatically shared to GDAX.
@_date: 2017-12-16 08:27:59
Two things;
1). Are you guys saying “hodl” (hold) on purpose? I’ve been seeing this a lot now.
2). He does want his cut but that specific percentage can be a lot lower if the asset is held for over a year. That’s how capital gains tax works.
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:02:50
@_date: 2017-12-16 05:23:09
Futures are used to hedge risks. Hedging reduces volatility and uncertainty so think of the CME and CBOE and the others on the way will temper the volatility.
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:31:37
The ENTIRE rollout was just so bizarre. The president did a CNBC interview less than two weeks ago and it was almost as if he was smiling at the camera while saying; you guys are about to get screwed!
Brian has to do a lot more than a Medium post. This is next level crazy.
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:38:26
Wow �� 
@_date: 2017-12-16 05:41:15
That sucks!!!
@_date: 2017-12-17 04:44:28
15 Bitcoins is a pretty good deal. I’ll see what I can do.
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:40:30
Nope. It’s the South Korea hack.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:18:07
Ah! So he’s like Jordan Belfort.
@_date: 2017-12-17 17:35:44
What are you considering to be significantly?
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:57:56
Bitcoin hasn’t even reached my price target ceiling yet so in terms of percentage gains, I think I’ll be fine.
So set a price target and see what happens.
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:00:02
Hahahahahahah. No friggin way.
@_date: 2017-12-21 06:23:35
...or he can not spread fear in the market by using a major financial news outlet.
@_date: 2017-12-27 03:38:12
Capital Gains Status:
Investment held for less than a year: ordinary income tax bracket.
Investment held for more than a year: 15% tax rate.
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:45:24
Securities laws would disagree with you.
@_date: 2017-12-16 08:45:20
The problem with that is due to the volatility so Bitcoin will unlikely be used as a currency to purchase everyday items....anytime soon.
Here’s an example;
A bottle of water may cost $1.00USD. Tomorrow that bottle of water will most likely still cost $1.00USD.
Bitcoin, however, is very different. The price drastically changes by the second so it would be harder to price the bottle of water in terms of Bitcoin because we don’t really know the actually value of Bitcoin.
Bitcoin is more like gold. Think of it as a very long term “investment”.
I’m writing an entire white paper on this where I go deeper.
Disclosure; my investment firm does own Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-16 11:17:23
Lol. Nice!!!!
@_date: 2017-12-23 09:15:26
Pay attention to the posts that gets the most upvotes and views. It’s Reddit. I used to say the same thing.
Say something of substance = little to no value.
Make a witty comment = great value.
@_date: 2017-12-21 05:56:12
@_date: 2017-12-25 20:54:12
This needs to be researched.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:14:03
You guys really don’t like this Roger guy.
@_date: 2017-12-21 04:47:10
Options give the right but NOT the obligation.
@_date: 2017-12-17 17:23:35
@_date: 2017-12-23 07:00:29
Yeah, you have to move them from the exchange.
@_date: 2017-12-21 01:00:54
For those that downvoted. Here's the video: 
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:05:17
Amazing, huh?
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:58:57
Lol �� 
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:39:11
Gemini or Binance.
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:38:39
Great username.
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:08:14
I couldn’t agree more. Don’t look at an opportunity and get worried. Take advantage. If you truly believe in Bitcoin and the underlying technology then you shouldn’t panic when these events occur.
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:40:55
No issues so far.
@_date: 2017-12-25 08:08:18
The limited supply would make the current price undervalued...so there’s that.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:21:46
Hahaha. There’s still time.
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:11:46
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:58:11
Depends on where you are.

@_date: 2017-12-18 21:32:04
To simplify this; a major boom is causing growing pains for the major companies in the space.
It will get better. The overwhelming bullish response is what is primarily causing these issues.
@_date: 2017-12-23 06:52:39
Jim, is that you?
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:03:48
@_date: 2017-12-16 09:12:34
How much research have you done?
@_date: 2017-12-20 09:54:32
Insider trading is obvious but it’s probably not enough to get the regulators (I know, I know) involved.
Brian Armstrong probably just gave the employees Christmas bonuses...by screwing over some of you guys.
Why would you even think about buying Bitcoin Cash is beyond me but hey.
@_date: 2017-12-21 06:52:31
I second that. They’re pretty much relegated...as ironic as that seems.
@_date: 2017-12-24 01:49:52
@_date: 2017-12-17 18:04:06
Not all people pay taxes.
@_date: 2017-12-16 10:06:13
Lol. I felt bad for him while I watched that video.
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:41:37
Coinbase owns GDAX.
@_date: 2017-12-25 19:59:34
Christmas �� miracle.
@_date: 2017-12-28 20:24:23
No, you currently cannot.
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:54:56
Except it’s creating panic now.
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:09:35
Yeah, I’ve already posted that: 
@_date: 2017-12-18 08:01:46
Change the font.
@_date: 2017-12-23 03:16:54
I use Gemini and Bitstamp. No issues...yet.
@_date: 2017-12-17 17:26:29
Not daily currency due to volatility.
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:13:16
Yeah. But we know most of these people are just speculators.
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:38:31
Ok, a question about the market. Do you anticipate the market value of BCH to exceed Bitcoin’s?
@_date: 2017-12-17 17:47:44
Preferred because the you have higher spending limits.
@_date: 2017-12-17 02:13:26
Two reasons;
1). There is an overwhelming bullish stance on Bitcoin.
2). Based on our research, Bitcoin is only at a fraction of its potential impact.
Yeah, we have a BUY rating on the crypto currency.
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:01:22
Say for example you know that the price of a item  sold by a company is going to go higher in one week.  The CEO or a board member of the company told you. You can buy as many of the items at the current price and then when the price goes in a week you can sell it at a huge profit.
Basically you made a lot of money on NON-PUBLIC information which gave you a COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE.
@_date: 2017-12-17 04:16:23
@_date: 2017-12-18 07:09:30
Ali, how long did it take you to make this?
@_date: 2017-12-24 05:49:39
Smart...but you might be upset later when the price shoots way up.
@_date: 2017-12-17 01:44:31
I thought you said you did your research.
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:20:17
Why are you dying?
@_date: 2017-12-18 07:11:05
@_date: 2017-12-17 07:29:40
Do you have your series 65 license?
@_date: 2017-12-16 05:20:15
1.83%...and then subtract taxes.
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:45:48
You can watch it.
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:51:09
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:45:58
Oh ok.
@_date: 2017-12-16 10:07:27
I guess you mean the percentage gains.
@_date: 2017-12-17 04:33:37
You must be pissed!
@_date: 2017-12-17 03:06:25
MTGox...or something like that.
@_date: 2017-12-17 17:40:59
Add more.
@_date: 2017-12-17 02:37:55
First years?
@_date: 2017-12-18 08:37:00
Futura or Helvetica.
@_date: 2017-12-20 11:00:04
We’re in agreement in regards to the long term holders and the Bitcoin core, let’s say, will have a higher market cap.
Core Bitcoin will be used as store value and with the limited quantity; this should push prices up.
@_date: 2017-12-17 02:19:43
Wow! That’s actually an interesting perspective.
@_date: 2017-12-23 06:55:38
Billionaires rarely do.
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:06:34
Oh ok.
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:52:12
You bought ten bitcoins for $1,000.00 each or...?
@_date: 2017-12-23 06:53:24
Always with the tough questions.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:14:25
The original OG....imagine.
@_date: 2017-12-17 02:26:47
It will be the equivalent of gold. It’s unlikely that it will be used for everyday transactions due to the price volatility.
If what you’re saying is true then you’re doing pretty good right now.
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:19:16
Is this for real?
@_date: 2017-12-18 07:17:01
....after the 2008 crisis where financial media outlets encouraged bad behavior they are now taking a more pessimistic tone. That’s pretty much why you’re seeing their tone shifting.
@_date: 2017-12-23 17:41:16
Aka a very nice Christmas discount.
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:18:34
Hahaha at avocado. Bravo!
Anyway, so the only advantage is lower fees? I mean if you really analyze both side by side you’ll see that you’re not actually buying a vastly superior asset.
I don’t hate it. I just find it weird as to why someone would buy it when the underlying value isn’t really there.
@_date: 2017-12-23 20:27:32
Thank you. What kind of “stealth” rollout was that!?
@_date: 2017-12-17 02:57:19
No, you don’t. Crypto currency doesn’t have their version of the FDIC yet.
@_date: 2017-12-16 05:23:56
Was this the Fast Money interview?
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:36:55
The SEC handles securities regulation.
@_date: 2018-02-02 01:37:25
Fair enough!
@_date: 2018-02-01 05:34:44
Very nice!
@_date: 2018-02-17 21:42:12
@_date: 2018-02-16 06:11:26
Gemini has a NY license as well.
@_date: 2018-02-04 14:50:32
Is it BK?
