ok, so i tried to build a quick summary from several of the comments, relevant if you use the blockchain.info android app.  
* it's possible for an attacker to get a copy of the wallet encrypted with only the second password
* any app could access a backup of the blockchain app [on the sdcard](
* malicious app with [root access]( could also send wallet to attacker for offline bruteforce
* speculation that whatandroid torrent app (op [did not]( have installed) [may be malicious](
* bruteforce of a random 8 character password is possible with gpu or fpga in [very short time](
however, i didn't find any comments to suggest that the second password could be compromised, perhaps with the exception of an android keylogger?  does anyone know of successful android keyloggers in the wild?
also, the attacker has no way of knowing a password would be easy to bruteforce.  is it reasonable to suspect an attacker would only attempt to brute force stolen wallets with high value?

with blockchain you can add a second password that's required to send coins from your wallet, and it applies to the mobile app as well.  that way if your phone is stolen you are likely safe (assuming the second password isn't compromised).

can you speak to using the text messages for two factor auth vs google authenticator?
