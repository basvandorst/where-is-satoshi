That’s actually a really good point that I haven’t thought of. I assumed that Coinbase was bigger than Mtgox because of its USD volume, but really Mtgox with 2017 BTC values would be a colossal empire.

It’s a bot account.

China's announcement that they're clamping down on currency leaking out of the country. The jump in CNY was reactionary and it'll correct soon
China's measures might be sustainable long term, but the yuan has been trending downwards anyway because of the strength of the US dollar. And there's a high probability of a trade issues with the United States that puts the yuan at even more risk.
The US dollar is still rallying and it's expected to continue rallying.

For some reason (lol) Coinbase only lets you buy at the highest recent price and sell at the lowest recent price. Most fiat banks do this with exchange rates. 
If you keep refreshing you should be able to squeeze a few more cents out of them.

Bitcoin crashes all the time. It’ll skyrocket again in January. Just don’t look at the price for the next few weeks. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 15:59:15
Probably. There’s usually a crash after an ATH. That’s just how the cycle goes. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 00:26:48
Well, it can either go up or down. You should only be worried when the price stagnates and people start posting the "do something" meme.
@_date: 2017-11-10 11:22:24
As soon as someone posts the “do something” meme the price will probably crash.
I imagine it’ll hit a new ATH in a few weeks though.

As soon as someone posts the “do something” meme, Bitcoin is about to crash.
@_date: 2017-05-25 20:26:54
You do realize there has been a crash every second month right? This one was right on queue. I don't even blink anymore.

It's buying season

Ethereum and Litecoin have fairly big differences. In general though, blockchain allows for a number of different currencies. The "standard" is whatever the people decide is the standard. For now it's decisively Bitcoin

I find it kind of sad to watch. These shill accounts have been posting bullshit propaganda for years if you look at their history. I hope people don't take this seriously 
@_date: 2017-05-26 19:20:04
I mean, it crashed HARD back in January and ended up tripling a few months later. I'm not even blinking
@_date: 2017-05-25 19:00:44
Don't think about it too much OP. It's only been a day, and Bitcoin prices take a few months to really drive upwards. You really need to think in terms of years and not a 24 hour window.

Bitcoin is the base currency for altcoins. Pumping any altcoin helps Bitcoin.

Coinbase always goes down during dips. It might be the high traffic that crashes the site, giving them the benefit of the doubt. 
@_date: 2017-05-26 19:22:34
Crashes happen every second month. It's what happens when something inflates too quickly.
