You can if you accept to trust a third party who prevent double spend of the payer.
The payer and the third party have a 2of2 multisig in common and the third party doesn't allow the payer to double spend the funds.
You can safely accept payments from these kind of wallets as long as you trust the anti double spending procedures the third party put in place.
It is just a clever way to use multisig functionality ti solve a practical probkem.
Greenaddress wallets do this since 2013. Other companies offers services like this.

I think that the concerns about lightning are absolutely sound. There's no free ride. 
What I cannot understand is this continuous asking core developers for miracles frankly.
Bitcoin is merely a question of trade offs: if you want the maximum decentralization allowed in the world today, you simply cannot have a solution for cheap micropayments for everybody. The sky knows how much I would like to be wrong but I would like to hear if YOU  have a solution that doesn't compromise the achieved level of decentralization we enjoy today.

Simply wrong use cases.
As for the bet, It doesn't worth anyway to open and close a channel for a single bet and just dice should tie too much money for their customers.
You should tie into a channel the necessary for at least 6 or more payments. If that is not the case you are not really saving on chain transactions.


Yes you could but you shouldn't unless the exchange is available to route your payments to other entities you choose.
The only scenario I can see is if a well connected exchange act for you also like a very dynamic hub with whom you open a channel at each withdrawal. Maybe could be a business model for exchanges but their investments in terms of hot wallet (and the risk associated) would be huge.

The verification efforts will scale linearly instead of quadratically so the Dos concern is weak.


This depends mainly on the type of transactions. The more the transactions are complex the more the increase in capacity is AFAIK. I think we get 1.7X in the worst case.

One of the problem of the exchanges is the unique bank account.
The exchanges expenses and revenues are on the same account of customers' funds.
This is normally due to the difficulties exchanges have in opening more than one account. With this important step I hope to be possible for Bitstamp as well as others to keep customers' funds separated from the operative account of the exchange.
Bitstamp was in this condition. I hope today is not.

This. To receive funds *on the same channel* you should send money *through* LN. This means you have to connect your other node not to your first but to a node connected to your first, but this would undermine the purpose.
Once a channel is exhausted on one part, the only way to rebalance the channel is an opposite tx *on the same channel* arriving from the lightning network.

The Transactions "spend" outputs from other transactions by referring to them and providing the right data the script requires.
You can refer to a previous transaction output only entirely.
If you need to "spend" 1 bitcoin and you have no previous output of exactly 1 bitcoin + fees you have to cumulate smaller outputs (or even bigger) to reach and probably surpass the amount. 
You cannot alterate in any way the Unspent transaction Outputs you have control of, you can just unlock each of them providing the solution to the puzzle and re-lock them with the conditions you choose. This is what we call to "spend" our coins.
If you think to the transactions in this way you get a better comprehension of why bitcoin is programmable money. It is all about satisfying given software conditions embedded in the script that lock your previous transactions' outputs but you can unlock each of them only entirely and you cannot give a "solution fits two or more problems". At least not at the moment.
Also you have to remember that the signature certifies the possession of the private key but also the integrity of the various component included so to check the integrity of two different outputs you need two verifications because two outputs are different even if the address is the same.

Microsoft is preparing a new decentralized identity system which will relay on the public Bitcoin blockchain for the certification of the public keys. 
This is an ongoing effort by many. Among them I would point to the work of Christopher Allen.

If I cannot use Bitcoin I have or I will have alternatives but they all will be controlled by someone.
And also the Blockchain as a global notary book is not such if a government or a company can shut it down or alter its contents.

I can see your point and back in the days I loved to use my only address but please be aware that reusing your address exposes you also:
* to the danger of exposing your ~~private~~ public key to a not too sophisticated software if the "k" factor generated when you sign is not generated randomly enough. Blockchain.info has fallen in this problem at least twice (Roger please don't sue me)
* Spending from one address exposes the private key of your address forever. And today is not a big deal but tomorrow it could.

As the article states if you reveal the public key on the public network you have no more the security of the hashing part to protect your money. If deducing a private key from a public key one day  could be possible, to deduce the public key from an address is widely recognized as almost impossible or anyway way way harder.
Just this. I know it is not a big deal right now but is one more reason not to reveal your public key if you are not obliged to.

Never understood what the measure could indicate so it is not of any indication to me.
It attribute simply MUCH more weight to the spending of old outputs against newer. Meaning?
The network is becoming more wise and the wallet use a FIFO logic in spending output???
Early adopters spend much more than they did before or new adopter spend less than before??
Old miners have started to sell immediately as they gain??
IMHO a tremendous increase in deys destroyed doesn't mean absolutely nothing in quantity or quality of adoption so why measure?
Please enlighten me.
@_date: 2015-12-20 16:04:49


Yes. This should be it for many reasons. Mainly privacy and security. Let's say "it would be much better".


Mainly because they don't know or they don't care but if you do, you'd better not.


Yes it does. Companies like these are meant to *help* the user by removing some burden like custody, tax reporting, address issuing, selling bitcoins etc.. But if you can avoid the company and take the burden you can obtain independence.
In Bitcoin you have a choice.


Every bitcoin transaction remains forever in the blockchain and can be traced afterward. if some of the transactions arrives to a single address they are "tightened" together for future analysis making easier to follow the path of the money that have passed by you organization.
Also the first time you spend FROM an address you reveal to the world the corresponding public keys potentially making the address less secure. The less amount you keep on a single address, the better.
Lastly everytime you sign a transaction you have to use a randomly generated number. If the random algorithm is not of quality it is possible to guess the private key. This is hard technical stuff for me but Blockchain.info knows a lot about this. For this and probably other reasons once again:
* the less transactions you make from a single address
* the lower amount of bitcoins you keep on a single bitcoin address
the better.

I don't agree:

* There are many snippets you can use to automate the generation of fresh new addresses while keeping you private keys safe offline. No need for manual operation.

"Is my backup obsolete?" Shouldn't be a question a user should ask himself.
Blockchain.info used to disseminate backups everywhere the user wanted to prevent problems at every spending. It was one of the reasons I changed wallet.

Today yes. Maybe tomorrow people will get an hour salary as far as we know.


Also this is an arbitrary assumption. It may as it as well may not.


Bcash has increased by 8x and doesn't support lightning. If you think Lightning isn't worth use bcash.


That's why there's a lot of road ahead to do before judging from ignorant standpoint.
Seriously, it is not correct to state that Lightning Network will solve all the needs in terms of payments as it is to state in advance that some of the targets of the technology are impossible to reach.
It is to early to figure out how lightning will or will not work but we can all say that the first experiments look very promising.

Rising the block size it is not the solution here. Fees will rise anyway. Please do some math.
I'm frustrated too. But that's just the way it is.
How much would be the right blocksize to be comparable to the VISA circuit? And you do have to pay fees to use them as well and they don't cover the entire demand. Also they consider under 2 dollars or so transactions not convenient.
The solution to micropayment SHOULD relay somewhere else...

Rescuing your stash from a 2011 backup suggests that you haven't done many transactions during this period.
If you had used your bitcoins during this years they would have gone to newly generated change addresses absent in your backup and you wouldn't have had your money back.
With bitcoin core you have to refresh your backup. Better if you do it everytime you spend.

* The coinbase transaction input field (this part is not entirely clear to me)
* the unusual “Anyone can spend” option of a Bitcoin transaction

Bitcoin should be about taking as much control as possible of your money. This means also to delegate the least possible to third parties who can under some circumstances shut down your node, spying what you are doing or also cheating your transactions for economic or political purposes.
in the case you run your node on a third party infrastructure you are trusting it not to cheat you or the system in general and this could be a not irrelevant assumption. 
The more part of your node is owned and controlled by you the more Bitcoin can be independent and distributed.

The operation of funding a lightning wallet involves a normal bitcoin transaction from a bitcoin client (i.e. Electrum) to your lightning network client (zap).
1. Obtain a new address from Zap
2. Send money from Electrum to Zap
3. Wait for confirmations.
Now you have funded your lightning network client.

I tend to think that if three projects (ECLAIR, c-lightning and lnd) sit at a table (project Milano) to agree to a set of rules to interoperate and work hard for more than 2 years for this purpose and a 4th project later decides to go its own way, the non interoperable of the 4 is the 4th. 
I can understand that the protocol might be non optimal and the LIT protocol might be better but this has nothing to do with interoperability.
I know and I have personally tested interoperability among the three implementation. With which other implementation is interoperable LIT?
If it is interoperable with itself I wouldn't call it interoperability.
Tadge is one of the developers I admire the most and I haven't clue of the resons he has taken the direction he has but I'm sure they were good.
It's simply very sad to see LIT out of the network.

Well it depends if they can bring in more warranties than SPV nodes especially by mean of future developments like fraud proof.
The amount of verifications you can bring to the system has a decreasing marginal utility and the possibility to have in the future some "almost full nodes" on low resource devices is very interesting to me.
@_date: 2015-12-03 15:47:19


Take your time. Mission critical software takes a lot of time and testing.
In Bitcoin software changes have technical and political impacts and that's what the blocksize debate is about. It is not easy to figure out how the network can change when a possible improvement is implemented. If decentralization is considered a critical feature by the user then I can see why a *possible* decrease in decentralization is seen as a threat by the community despite the evident need for scalability. 
I personally think that if we share the same ideas we will find the best way to scale.
@_date: 2015-12-28 00:13:59
In the future your node could produce a fraud proof for your "light client" at least according to Bitcoin Core plans. 
"Light clients" are clients slightly heavier than SPV clients that can verify transactions through fraud proofs produced by nodes you trust in a much trustful way. At least this what I have understood.

Absolutely. Than I don't see where is the problem.

Because the Trezor gives you the ability to spend them in a relatively simple and safe way.
Paperwallets are wonderful but to spend them properly is very difficult for anyone who doesn't know what he is doing.
An alternative to Trezor is Hardwarewallet.com ( it has no display but there's the possibility to verify the transaction with the 2FA provided by Greenaddress.it.
I think that since this august things has really changed in usability and safety in Bitcoin.

* An inside job.

The blockchain is the only globally recognized decentralized digital ledger in existence.
It is obvious to me that many people try to use it for proof of existence or certification of every genre.
It is impossible to avoid it (you can always hash a document and send some money to the derived address for instance) but OP_RETURN is an elegant solution to embed a small amount of data at the price of a due fee.
In my opinion 40 bytes are more than enough for anyone. If you are saying they are not you are not a software architect, you are a politician.
@_date: 2014-06-21 08:25:47
Bitcoin should be decentralized period.
It is actually impossible to prevent double spending in a decentralized way in the first moments with the use of the bitcoin protocol period.
In this context I personally think Greenaddress proposal is the best compromise found to date.
It is open and requires scrutiny by normally skilled people. It's a free choice and involves only specific kind of transactions where you need instant confirmation.
If you buy a couch on Overstock with a coinbase wallet you are already in a centralized environment but no one has talked about it. Greenaddress proposal is much more open in this context and represents a good compromise in this moments in which we have much greater compromises in bitcoin world like centralized exchanges (we cannot get rid of fiat. Can we?).

I do and I use it because I think HW1 used with greenaddress' 2FA is safe enough for me. In the confirmation message I can read the details of the transaction before sending the coins. This is enough for me. Comparing to Trezor the hardware security is superior. HW1 can be used with my mobile, Tezor cannot.
DISCLAIMER: I own and I like both.
In the article the backup is "unknown" but with Greenaddress you can backup your mnemonic your seed before writing it on the dongle.

"pizza", "mandolino", "mafia" and "cash is king". Italian's popular stereotypes are moving gentlemen.
Italy is quickly moving away of cash BUT bitcoin is not going to replace it:
* Even if it's true that Italy was one of the most dynamic country in the world in the adoption of mobile phones, italians in general are not very tech-savy so the normal UI barrier in Italy is a little steeper
* The cash is still loved but simply is always harder to use it everywhere due to new regulatory restrictions introduced in the last three or four years
* Italians are good poets, artists and whatever you can think of immaterial but when it comes to money they love cash for the sound of paper and metal and they don't trust so much anything that is digital. You can say this for the average Joe but I think in Italy this is still a bit more True (IMHO).
* Even If there could be a little "spike" in bitcoin adoption due to someone famous who start using them (in Italy emulation is strong) the fiscal police would immediatly fly over everything who mention it to gain some headline in the news. 
A good bank manager of the largest bank in Italy told me that they are investing a lot in online services but with the average age of population and the usage  of online banking services in Italy, the physical branch is still hugely important in respect to the  online service and it is not moving fast as one would expect.
There are some nice exceptions (I helped a bar to start accept bitcoin  but I wouldn't be optimistinc in this country. The only way for me is a slow, understated, silent, adoption.

Store the large part of your stash in a cold wallet. Better if BIP38 or multisig protected (or both) period. 
Test everything before doing anything.
Keep what you will spend in the next month in a hot wallet. These are the choices in order of safety:
* offline client wallet (electrum, Armory, multibit?)
* online multisig wallets with 2Fa like bitgo and greenaddress.it with HD wallets (easier backups)
* clients like armory, electrum or multibit wired on your desktop
* online non hd and non multisig wallets like blockchain.info in which you have anyway the control of your private keys
* online non hd non multisig wallets in which YOU HAVEN'T the full control of your private key (coinbase)
I'm not writing that Coinbase isn't safe but that their model offers a wider attacker surface so it is theorethocally weacker of the alternatives listed above.

Electrum seed is not the same as greenaddress seed.
Electrum was born much before bip38 was issued and greenaddress follow bip38 standard. So pretty much even if now electrum follows somehow also bip38 it is feasible that your seed follows the "classic" electrum format.

Greenaddress can guarantee the counterpart of the payment you are doing that you won't double spend the funds.
It is an API that any merchant can implement and gives the possibility to consider the funds in the wallet immediately if of course the merchant trusts Greenaddress as a third party to protect it from buyer's double spending.
If the merchant is an exchange it can consider your funds immediately trusted and you can sell right away on the market. 
This is a good news for arbitraging and it will become better news when other exchanges and eventually merchants will enter in this ecosystem.

Analyse your process in depth. Do your homework also with many UML diagrams. Try to define exactly what you need.

To protect the keys I would build a process involving offline signing by some old pc kept protected and out of the network. You should write the scripts for offline signing. I suggest pybitointools because is the only one I have used.

Is the exadecimal number essential? From an unsability point of view is not as nice as the rest (I guess probably it is). The second design is better because it shows the pending traansactions. nevetheless I don't think there will be many concurrent pending transactions. It maybe "overinformative". 
I think that if the line of the provider with a pending transaction could be shown bigger or bold that would be enough.

Pay attention though. Sooner or later you will find yourself with many addresses in the online wallet (the Master Public Key one). when you do the transaction it will generate other addresses that your offline wallet is not aware of and it will not be able to sign the transaction offline. 
Don't panic. There is a command to generate new addresses on your offline wallet (normal, and change addresses). Generate them until you will find the addresses involved in the transaction you build with your online wallet.

Well I'll try to explain what probably I didn't understand either:
If you check on blockchain, even if you use their API you RELY on their version of the database and have an indirect access to the blockchain.
With bitcoind your computer or server IS part of the network and you have a working copy of the blockchain. You are querying the blockchain on your computer which is faster and more reliable.
You can query the database fast if it is totally indexed (a lot of disk space), slowly if it is not indexed or in a fast way if you give the public key you are interested in (with this new possibility). Please correct me if I'm wrong.

Why using a complex mechanism of nlock transaction instead of giving the user the control of his money by two keys in his possession in a a two of three keys system?
Don't get me wrong, I like greenaddress.it but if a service is too complex without a very good reason I prefer not to trust it
@_date: 2014-12-07 07:20:24


DISCLAIMER: I don't have any economic interest in the company and I simply use the wallet personally.
Yes they can but only temporarily. You always have an nLocktime transaction that return all the funds to you after a desired number of blocks (you can set the number in the "settings" page. They also have a site  [site]( to redeem your funds from the zipped transaction and they give you also the [source code] ( if you think that one day they can escape and shutdown the site.
An other simpler solution to protect your funds with Greenaddress if you don't trust them is to make an additional "account"  2of3 linked to the same seed. 
In that process you have to write down an additional seed and take note of the additional master public. If you do that you will be able to redeem the funds in that account  with an electrum plugin (version 2.0) or doing some coding yourself whenever you want even if the have blackmailed you. The only drawback is that you loose the feature of Instant transaction (which I don't use so much today).
The best practice in my opinion is to keep in the "main" account only the amount you want handy to use their instant confirmation feature and the rest in a 2of3 subaccount.
If you look for alternative Bitgo or Copay are interesting even if IMHO Greenaddress is better from a security point of view (I personally tend to prefer randomly generated seeds) and it also supports hardware wallets (hardwarewallets.com) also with Android devices. Also you can store the seed on a QR code or in an NFC tag BIP39 encrypted (I tend to to prefere hardware solutions though).
If you code and you would like experiment interesting services I suggest you to take a look to Cryptocorp.co, trustedcoins.com and block.io.

So while Colored Coins "tag" some fraction on the official and today only blockchain, in the sidechains the protocol **lock** some coin in the blockchain so their value can be preserved to be used in an alternative blockchain where other assets could also exist and the value of those is linked to the original locked coins.
The value of the asset on the sidechain is *testified* by the sacrifice of the locked coins which cannot be used in the main chain but is *certified* by the possibility to go back and free the coins in the main chain by locking the assets in the sidechain. For an appropriate explanation of sidechains I suggest you to [read the whitepaper] (

Well, when someone say 0% fee please check the exchange rate. Bips.me has been around for a while but I don't have experience on their service. What I know for sure they're doing their business on exchange rate which is legittimate but not transparent and may confuse potential customers.
So my suggestion is: coinbase, bitpay, bips.me are probably all good but check every component of the cost and judge which is the one you want to work with...
The step you have made have driven this community ahead.
Thank you

It depends. The leaking of ONE private key and of the master public key compromises the entire chain. If the multisig policies are based on addresses composed with private keys of the same compromised wallet, multisig doesn't help at all.

If I can suggest something, remeber: computers are not safe.
So today the right choice fo serious storage deal with paper or hardware wallets.
If you want to use your bitcoins go for hardware wallets.
Trezor and Hardwarewallet.com (BTChip) are in my opinion two good choices. You already know Greenaddress. I would go for it with btchip (Hardwarewallet.com).
I like Trezor and I own three of them but if one get stolen, to read inside it is trivial. Citation needed? Please ask to whom is more expert than me. I have personally seen one open Trzor wiith many wires attached and through them the guy could read the seed but I'm not able to say more (I am not such an expert). That said I keep on suggesting them because they are simple and safer than PCs and Macs.
Btchip uses banking standards and in conjunction with greenaddress can provide you the safety of the transaction through the 2fa by which you can check the correctness of the transaction's detail on your phone before confirming it.
Anyway Please, please take your money out of Blockchain. Those guys used to rock but they haven't done anything for security in two year. Their model sucks:
* They send encrypted backup every transaction instead of using Hd wallets
* You have to instruct the wallet to create new addresses (the default behaviour takes to addresses reuse)
* they don't use multisig
* they don't use hardware wallets
* their javascript model is dangerous if you don't use the browser extension

Useful for accountability purposes.
It would be also useful to split the wallet in two: 
* One "pocket" account with the money you could afford to loose with the phone without the second factor authentication very easy and smooth to use
* One "vault" account with a big balance used to refill the "pocket" account on daily or weekly use
This will probably be possible with the second phase of the project when different accounts will have different policies.
Greenaddress already allow to have an amount you can spend without the second factor authentication but the use of different accounts will show a clearer situation to the user.
You could do the same by having two accounts but with subaccounts you have all the situation with one only login.
so now you can have your seed:
* On a QR code (encrypted BIP38 or not)
* On an NFC tag (encrypted BIP38 or not)
* On an hardware wallet (BTChip)
* Encrypted on the device protected by a PIN
And once logged in you can have one or multiple accounts.
Many options.

The only issue here is that you have to understand how bitcoin-qt works before deciding to use it.
It has always worked like this for privacy reasons and this affect also the backup plan (you basically have to bakup very often).
Hd wallets are actually a solution if you want to put all the eggs in one basket of course (but also with qt you have all the eggs in the wallet.dat basket).
I personally prefer electrum for this reason and I don't see why a beatyful wallets like multibit, armory or hive doesn't support HD wallets.
One issue with hd wallets might be new private keys import but it could be solved by swiping the new key.

Who had the luck to listen to Rick Falkvinge's presentation in Amsterdam at the Bitcoin Foundation Conference knows exactly what is happening here.
For the less lucky this is the presentation: 
My personal and limited TL;DR Is: Authorities has always tried to limit innovation to favour traditional business and status quo. The word "red flag" derives its meaning from the first regulation about cars.
According to this law the first cars were allowed to circulate only if on board there were at least three people with specific roles: Driver, stoker, red flag waver.
The red flag waver had to walk in front of the car waving a red flag turning the car into an slow clumsy mean of transportation.
Excuse my english and if you can, read the abstract and eventually the presentation. Very instructive.

As I wrote it is not a security issue in itself . Please read while I leave the room and you keep on using your favorite wallet.


This is bad because address reuse is a security and privacy flaws in any case. Even if the companies are compelled to keep the records at least they don't (normally) leak your bitcoin financial history to everyone.
If you reuse always the same addresses your income and expenses are traceable for anyone with an internet connection.
As long as the security is concerned signing expenses  from the same address expose various value of a random variable that in the long run could allow the guessing of the related private key. 


Here I agree but at least Greenaddress encourage the use of his webapp and has also implemented an hardware wallet. I don't know Hive and I cannot say anything about it.

At the end of 2014 the most used bitcoin wallet:
* store an encrypted version of its users' wallet supported by javascript technology using users passwords
* hasn't implemented hd wallet (BIP32) for a more handy backup and privacy
* Doesn't use multisig technology for safer storage
* Doesn't implement hardware wallets for safer handle of keys
I think we cannot afford an other Mt.gox scandal. So many users' wallet out there depend on a very old technology.
I wouldn't care at all. They are not my bitcoins but a serious breach in a so wide spread wallet could affect the whole community.
The fact that Coinbase is not more advanced in these fields is not a great relief to me.

It is not related to 2of2 multisig.  Merchants can trust whoever they want for whatever reason. 
Multisig 2of2 is the specific method Greenaddress uses to control the transaction and to make it reliable.
The extension basically allow a payee to say: "hi,  I accept instant confirmation from A, B and C" and the instant confirmation provider say:"hi, I'm B". 
The rest covered in this comments is about HOW Greenaddress can effectively avoid double spending and why it could eventually be included in one merchant's instant confirmation providers list.
@_date: 2014-03-30 18:13:44


Instead to split your private key you should transfer you btc to a p2sh multisig address. To spend the fund from such an address you do NOT have to join the keys on a computer.  You can instead sign a redeeming transaction on each device which holds the key.
The only thing that goes out of each them is the signature of the script.

For what I read the service monitors the network and look for other attempt to spend the same output. 
For this reason the more nodes you are connected to the more the monitoring is effective. Then in real time it gives feedback on the presence of these attempts. 
IMHO a technology based on multisig like Greenaddress is more effective because it doesn't only monitor but simply avoid the possibility of double spending the same output but of course is more complicated to set it up and to explain.

The problem with the trezor is that you can take the seed out of it if you can grab it. So if you happen to loose one have an other one ready to move your funds. That could become expensive but you can also use the python utility.
@_date: 2014-06-14 17:14:04
Yes. "Such an address" can assure a third party that you are not able to scam it doing a double spend. This address is a 2of2 address and neither you neither Greenaddress alone can redeem the fund.
Greenaddress will sign everything you have decided to sign but it will check that you won't try to double spend the fund somewhere else.

Choose 8 location. 
Print 400 addresses bip038 protected.
Make a copy of them.
Deposit in each location 100 addresses and the backup of that lot in an other location.
So you risk only 25% if one location is compromised but you also have the time and possibility to save your fund while the thieves are trying to brute force your bip038 protected papers.

IMHO there are two avoidable keystrokes.
When you have entered your pin and confirmed that, that should be it (if the tip is not due).
The first keystroke is to choose the account and should be skipped in the case of one account only.
The second keystroke is to confirm the amount of the payment and of the exchange rate but it should be avoided as long as Coinkite has a fair fixed policy on exchange rates.
The second is for the tip and I agree it's necessary in Canada (in Europe service is normally included)
@_date: 2014-06-14 17:39:30
I had the same perplexity I have to admit and still I think luckly Greenaddress is a choice like everything thank God in bitcoin. You are not obliged to use it.
If you give partial control of your fund to Greenaddress though you can still spend your funds wherever you want. The only thing they will stop you from doing is double spending. I think is an honest compromise to overcome the legitimate doubts of a third party waiting money from you.
It is not the panacea. It's something smart and valuable in many contexts that there wasn't and now there is.

Multisig provides theoretically safer custody. Wallets like Bitgo and greenaddress.it don't keep a cold wallet for you. All your bitcoins are directly stored in the blockchain and you are in control of 100% of your money even if they close down the service.
Coinbase has control over the keys that holds 95% of your bitcoins. Bitgo and Greenaddress.it cannot do absolutely anything with your bitcoins (as long as they don't have access to your keys of course).
Coinbase is wonderful to buy bitcoins if you are a US resident but as long as trust is concerned your question is "reversed". Coinbatse imply a huge amount of trust in the company compared to the multisig wallets in which you control the 100% of your funds.
Blockchain.info  also puts you in control but doesn't help you to control the custody  through  multisig.

I cannot help you but I want to express my solidarity to you. 
Many people will tell you you should have been more prudent but I have been in your same situation andIknow how it feels.
I was lucky and my problem was the known safari bug and was able to save me.
I beg everybody's pardon but I think bip38 has sonething perverted inside. It's very dangerous to use it without proper testing.
My suggestion for everybody? Please test your password with multiple implementations in a safe environment before actually encrypt your private keys or don't encrypt them at all.

Extremely interesting. So there were two ways to send coinbase bitcoins to Mt.gox:
* pointing directly the result of the coinbase to one Mt.Gox deposit address
* Sweeping the private key relative to the coinbase (to be verified)


this seems to be in contrast with the report (which anyway should not be considered as the ultimate truth) in the part where it cites "recognizable amounts". If Eligius split the revenue among different addresses according to their contribution to the hashrate then the amount of the transactions directed to mt.gox would appeared not "recognizable". The sweeping of one key instead would be likely always 50 btc or the miner of provenience could have not been Eligius. Maybe I'm pushing my self too far ahead.

To clarify a bit the concept is the same but the way in which Greenaddress.it implements it is very different.
Greenaddress can assure the counterpart of the payment because is the cosigner of the transaction. Without his signature the payer cannot spend and it check that he is not going to utilize the output somewhere else before cosigning. Using HD wallets you can also provide always new addresses for privacy and safety concerns.
As more merchants will come in I think Greenaddress will be the best wallet for the daily expenses because of instant confirmation and chip support (
For the custody of bigger amount I still prefer to be in total control of the funds. 
If they implements 2 of 3 signing wallets (in which you have the absolute ownership of 2 keys) in their new subaccounts it would become good also as "vault".
@_date: 2014-07-24 06:52:12
One of the most balanced article I have read to date. It is also well documented and its arguments are solid.
The only thing I can say is that Bitcoin's success won't be explosive and it will be waaaay slower than other internet phenomena we have seen so far.
The usability is still orrible and the risk of loosing money for mistakes in handling the keys are still too high. This is the other part of the problem we have to face beyond volatility.
At the structural level I'm really worried about mining centralization which could destroy Bitcoin's distinctive value proposition.

To test a private key you can sign a message and then verify it. To do it offline the quickest thing that come into my mind is:
Goto brainwallet.org
Save the whole html page
Save it on a usb key
Open it on a disconnected usb live linux distribution
Goto the page relative to the signing and verify stuff
Try to sign and verify a message with your private key
Alternative: trust bitaddress.org. They have not done any known mistake to date.
On the other side if you take the duty of this verification you give a benefit to you and the community of an other check.

That's what I wrote
EDIT: 


What I meant here is that there is one closing transaction that summarize all the transaction you have made with your party of the channel. It is the actual NET state of the balance between the two parties of the channel.
One transaction that certify just the closing state is the idea, as you have written.
@_date: 2014-07-13 07:54:16
Fees are an important issue not for the cost of a normal transaction (something over 10 dollars) but for the feasibility of Bitcoin to become a network for microtransactions too or not.
The actual trend as far as I know is to keep bitcoin for normal transactions and alternative channels for micro.
Alternative channels might be carried out by single providers with internal accountings (Coinbase, Circle) or by specific protocols like payment channels.
IMHO I would like to see Bitcoin for everything but I do understand miners need their fair cut and also we should avoid dust so it is a very complex issue. I simply hope Bitcoin network to be useful somehow also for microtransactions.

 Launder this 3000 bits
@_date: 2017-02-27 10:55:18
Yeah, kind of. let's say you have chain "A" at block number 10 and chain "B" at block number 5.
 If you spend with nlocktime 10, the nodes who supports the longest chain will broadcast the transaction and the miners of chain A will confirm it.
The nodes of chain B simply don't broadcast the transaction.
You can then prepare a second transaction that spend the same outputs but without the nlocktime.
Chain "A" refuses it as double spent. Chain "B" accepts it.
Obviously you can spend to different addresses to have an effective split. 
@_date: 2014-06-01 11:54:22
This is very good. I normally use an other analogy:
"Imagine there is only one bank with only one branch in which you can open as much account as you want. When you deposit money in this bank in your new account you can send them to any other account older like you do in a BANK GIRO but faster and cheaper. One only it system duplicated on thousands computers."
I have to admit though that bank analogy could confuse. What do you think?

Bitgo gives the user a theoretical superior control of his funds. 
With Greenaddress you put the money in a condition in which neither you or greenaddress has the total exclusive control of the funds for a certain amount of days.
So Bitgo may seem more trustworthy but Greenaddress gives you better privacy because it changes constantly the source  and destination addresses of your transactions allowing you to backup one single seed once. 
Moreover thanks to the fact it can have a power of "veto" on your transactions for a limited period it can assure instant confirmation transactions if the counterpart trusts their ability to defend them from double spending.
tl;dr: if security is exclusive total control Bitgo.  if security is also privacy Greenaddress.

AFSIU you can spend the coin on the longest chain by imposing the nlocktime accordingly (too high to be brodcast on the slower chain).
Then you can spend the same outputs on the slower chain by not setting the nlocktime: the longest chain sees the transaction as invalid (already spent inputs) while the slower chain accepts them. 
EDIT: in the case of a 50-50 split is a little tricky in effect.

We all want bitcoin to work in the way we like but to develop it in the long run you have to figure out a way sustain your efforts.

Double spend could become a reputation problem for bitcoin.
Double spend unconfirmed transaction IS possible and not difficult.
Precautions should be taken by merchants even if the damage for them is negligible.

According to they are implementing colored coins.

If I read well a company such as Bitpay could insert  two fields in their payment request which state that they will trust that the payment won't be double spent from second one without needing to wait the confirmation if the payment come from let's say a greenaddress wallet (but it could be any other party the decide to trust).
It could be interesting in many fields in which transactions need to be fast: for instance an exchange could support a bunch of wallets because they have anti double spending policies they have decided to trust enabling faster arbitrage operations.
One bitcoin atm producer could decide to trust some wallets as well to provide user provide with those specific wallets instantaneous withdrawals from their machines.
Private bitcoin purchases could be safer if the wallet of the receiver of the bitcoins could trust the sender's wallet because of its ability to prevent double spend and so on.
I have always appreciated the method Greenaddress use to prevent double spend but I have always asked myself:"how can the receiver of the payment know that this payment is from a greenaddress wallet provided that for privacy reasons Greenaddress never reuse the same address to pay?"
This BIP70 extension proposal is an elegant answer to many of my questions.

@_date: 2015-01-27 17:02:14
Well... No. Centralized systems you like it or not are cheaper and much more scalable.
The only reason you want a decentralized system is that you don't want to trust the issuer and the entity who keeps the ledger. 
In the case of the issuer of the tickets (and many other cases of the "blockchain 2.0 technologies") decentralization is totally unuseful and expensive.
@_date: 2015-01-26 07:29:14
If you think about how coinbase works it would be higly unfeasible they allow you to actually import your private keys (my speculation). 
They normally don't manage your own private keys unless inthe case of a 2of3 vault.
They probably allow you to sweep your private keys. This would make much more sense.
I would bet that if you send some bits to your "imported" address you won't see it on the balance of your account.
@_date: 2014-12-06 20:10:46
For so many months I have personally heard concerns about blockchain.info's security delicate points. They were people from the industry and from the core developers.
As a simple user I can point out only that:
* They still do not support hierarchical deterministic wallets. It is not a security issue *perse* but it forces the user to perform strange recurring backup procedures like sending the wallet around in your email address and/or your dropbox account EVERY time one transaction happen
* They still encourage addresses reusing despite all the articles published on the damage to privacy and security this behavior brings (I know citation needed but you can look almost everywhere)
* They are still using javascript in the browser and the web app that could  mitigate the risk connected with this practice is not enough suggested.
This is what a middle experience user like me can notice but I think an expert can tell you much more.
Once they used to append your password in clear text in the id of the barcode of the 2FA Authentication. You read it well: your password in clear text. I opened a ticket and they told me not to worry about it (about two months later). I think that at the time Bolckchain.info was a one man band but nevertheless I begin to suspect about the security of the wallet (probably they have fixed it but I don't care anymore)
Don't get me wrong your point is good.
But Core developers has the right to warn bitcoin users against bad security practices. They feel responsible somehow. 
The main problem is that Blockchain.info is the most used wallet out there and Mt. Gox was the most used exchange.
Someone who knows what is saying can (and IMHO must) do something before it's too late.
So I think that even if your point is good their point is much better.

Bitcoin and Bittorrent share some letters in the name and some concepts but they are totally different animals.
The purpose of bittorrent is to assure reliable downloads in any network condition. 
Bitcoin protocol purpose is to maintain consensus among independent actors on which is the right version of one continuously growing ledger. 
This continuous "discussions" among computers that do the same calculations make the network more robust but slow at best.
I beg your pardon if I don't bring to the table examples and references but maybe is enough to think that all the network is capable to to process between 3 and 7 transactions per seconds and you can increase the number of nodes and miners as you like but that number won't change.

No it is not. At least to me. Pantera Capital has put 10M$ in Bitstamp and is simply trying to protect his investment or what rest of it. They have surely sent someone they trust over there. Don't forget one of the collaborators of Pantera has written the first exchange engine and they surely have someone else to send. This is much more simple and probable to me.

Thank you for the answer.
This is very interesting and it configure a new scenario in which new Trust entities esist.
The hubs are much like banks and the promissory notes are much like mini checks of pre determined amounts.
I see two very strong points here:
* you avoid the blockchain but you have to trust the hub to redeem your promissory notes (without any government warranty)
* how long will it take before Hubs will issue MORE promissory notes than bitcoin they have cashed in? Or is there a "proof of reserve" incorporated in the promissory notes issuing?

AFAIK it is not. It is partially done by some companies, Blockstream being one of them.


The model should resemble to Redhat's one. By partially contributing they will likely be seen as experts and will be able to consult big companies willing to make business with the technology.
They are also building commercial sidechains to address specific market needs.
Sidechains can be seen as private permissioned blòockchains backed by the value bitcoins and customized on the needs of a specific industry.
Liquid is the first sidechain of this kind based on[ Strong Federation Pegging](

Block propagation for mining is already built mainly by separate networks and connections among miners (FIBER being the last and more advanced version). 
Big Mining pools wouldn't be affected. Maybe small solo mining equipment not connected with these "highways".
Part of the network would be slowed down because it would be somehow harder to get new blocks (only part of the nodes would relay them).
As far as I can see there would be a general network propagation performance slow down.
Nevertheless the hypothesys is interesting IMHO.

I have read everything and I'd like to thank everyone.
It is a very nice thread on a very intersting argument.
What I did personally get?
1. Trezor is far from perfect but it's way more secure than a connected pc to store private keys and so your bitcoins
2. Mytrezor.com is bad for privacy, is closed source (the back end) it's hardly decentralizable (bleah! What a word...) and is unstable but is the simplest way to take your money out of Trezor right now
3. In days (in months in english language) mytrezor will be much better in every sense, Greenbits' support (with embedded multisig additional benefit) will be ready and stable, electrum 2.0 will be out and multibit HD support will be ready too. Mycelium support seems a little bit at an earlier stage but we'll see.
4. The main theme today seems to provide the hardware wallet a way to "read the blockchain efficiently and fastly showing the less information possible to anyone" which is an evergreen in bitcoin challenges but denotes a smaller scope than one year ago.

No my friend. I'm afraid. Decentralization in somehow effective and resilient but far from being efficient. Consensus is a balance always recovering itself from time to time. 
This process known as reorg is the symptom of trial and errors that a straight centralized system doesn't need.
There are so many computers doing the same calculations over and over and confronting each other to reach consensus. This is far from an efficient process.
This is the strength of this wonderful system. This is also his weakness.

Please  ELI5 how the consumer buys promissory notes from the hub (I have understood that he doesn't open a payment channel) and how he pays for them.
EDIT: ok understood: the consumer does open a payment channel with the hub and pay forromissory notes one by one. Th difference with normal payment channel is:
* a new third party (stroem hub)
* the lack a payment channel in which merchant is involved (the only payment channel is between the consumer and the hub)
* the promissory note that is a sort of bank note issued buy the hub (insted of the bank) and reedeemable only by the merchant in any hub with a trust relationship with the original issuing hub (it reminds me a lot Ripple)
@_date: 2017-02-23 12:59:16
That also depends. There are two model: one established of a centralized consortium database which has shown to be efficient and scalable (-&gt;SWIFT) and  one of a "shared and duplicated ledger" with a consensus based on strong federation or an other type of mean to keep the copies aligned. 
I hope and believe liquid will bring us experience in this new kind of setup but AFAIK we still have no real working private blockchain yet (and liquid is a sidechain).

So if you want to take advantage of instant confirmation you use their 2of2. If you want to use their multisig feature but not the instant confirmation you can use their 2of3 subaccount.
I would use the 2of2 for everyday expenses and a 2of3 subaccount for bitcoin storage. So if something really bad happens only the "argent de poche" is temporarily frozen.  
If you use the wallet protecting your seed with an hardware wallet, voilà you get the best set up today available.

If you consider real dollars those in deposit in your bank then you should consider much more likely bitcoins those deposited in a channel because your bank can freeze your account for a long period of time. To have your money back you have to go to a judge or to the police.
To have your bitcoins back from a channel you publish the transaction.

Beautiful story but false in the silence of Core regarding the hard fork.


and some lines before:"Despite these considerable complications, with sufficient precautions, none of them is fatal to a hard fork, and **we do expect to make hard forks in the future**. But with segregated witness (segwit) we have a soft fork, similar to other soft forks we’ve performed and gained experience in deploying, that provides us with many benefits in addition to allowing more transactions to be added to the blockchain."
@_date: 2016-03-16 22:20:00
How do you measure unreasonable? I find very reasonable to give credit to people who work for the future of Bitcoin. How could you say it's too much?
You say: "*significant* influence over the direction of *Core*" that is pretty different from "*unreasonable level* of influence over) the direction of *Bitcoin*".


In which way segwit seems to steer Bitcoin in a way that serves Blockstream?
I sincerely Don't see any advantage Blokstream has more than anyone in the community apart having worked on it and tested it in part.
I don't think is a good behavior to stigmatize innovation in Bitcoin because maybe for the reason you have written it maybe you have written in a way that may advantage (in a way I don't know but I presume) the company for whom you work. 
Do you have a good idea to solve some problem segwit does solve?
Please give the community the opportunity to evaluate it.


In this thing I can agree but the only thing we can do is to pay directly the developers. If we cannot or don't want to do it we have to welcome the fact that a company born thanks to a bunch of developers whose interest is the future of Bitcoin exists. I know it's dangerous but it is the best we can have right now.

Opt-in RBF is the protocol that allows you to bump the transaction fees after you have broadcast it. At least one wallet is using it already. Many hopefully will come.
@_date: 2016-06-15 21:01:52
As of today AFAIK only Greenaddress does it.

He is in the control committee of "Blockchain" technologies Italian Association.
@_date: 2016-06-26 05:20:07
You can use also RBF to bump your fees and push your transaction through. Greenaddress can do it and maybe other wallets.
@_date: 2019-11-12 07:30:06
every passphrase is "like" appending a 25th word to your seed. You end up with a totally new wallet.
Ledger gives you the possibility to associate the new wallet to a different PIN, so you can use two wallets on the same device, simply activating it with two different PINs.
You can have 0.1 BTC on one wallet and 0.5 BTC on the other.
One mnemonic, two BIP32 seeds.

You can bump fees  with  Greenaddress now.
@_date: 2016-06-15 21:49:48
pretty much like if you have more mining power you can find a block before an other miner likely. Bitcoin is not a thing in which anyone can use the same resource with the same probability of who is paying more to use it to have more.

Yeah. Start using opt-in RBF open protocol. You can modify fees after the transaction has been sent. Today Greenaddress allows you to so.
@_date: 2016-06-22 02:16:04
Greenbits does it ("MAX" switch in send).
@_date: 2017-01-25 04:07:57
No. They cannot. As long you can use 2 keys out of three, they cannot hold them. Sure they can throw you in prison.

It integrates well also with Greenaddress.
@_date: 2016-06-27 20:55:50


No. the higher fee desn't go to the merchant as well as the original one which of course has never been included in the price. They go to miners. The Price shown to your wallet has never included miners' fee AFAIK.


This is your opinion and I respect it. For me as a buyer they work well and they would also if I was be a seller. At least this is my opinion.

Well. At least two things are not exactly recoverable from the seed:
* U2F because  the protocol requires an internal counter which keep tracks of the logins and if you loose the key you cannot restore from the seed.
* PGP keys. They have a feature that derives the private key from the seed but is experimental.
Apart from that, having the seed, you can recover the key at the same status of the lost one AFAIK.
@_date: 2017-08-04 20:08:40
the latter. Actually the reward derived by newly generated bitcoins (12.5) is superior by far but, as time goes by, fees will be more important, because every 4 years the reward from newly generated bitcoin halves.

No. To me the blockchain is MUCH MORE like a funnel. it doesn't put transactions in time. It puts transaction in order.
 &gt;Q3: If the blockchain doesn't timestamp transactions, then who declares what time the transaction was initiated? Don't they have to be timestamped?
No. they don't have to be timestamped in the strict sense of the word. The very essential thing is to know which transaction come before an other and there must not be a doubt in the world about the ordering.
@_date: 2016-06-15 20:51:32
Opt-in RBF allows you to modify the fees of your transaction if you want to push it to be confirmed quicker.
@_date: 2017-08-18 14:38:22
I intended the hardware key (the Ledger Nano S). I apologize but BTW the seed is the number from each every private key is derived deterministically, so it is more important than any individual private key.

Everytime the channel is updated, the participants provide each other with a secret which can steel ALL the bitcoin in the channel in the case the other party broadcast an old state of the channel. This pushes the parties to play honestly.
I strongly recommend to read the three wonderful articles of Aaron van Wirdum on the matter.
* 
* 
* 
"But what's stopping Bob from broadcasting the older commitment transaction instead? That commitment transaction led to a path that paid him six bitcoins, instead of five….
What’s stopping Bob, of course, is his first secret, which he has now given to Alice.
Bob cannot safely sign and broadcast the older commitment transaction any more, because Alice now knows Bob's first secret. If Bob were to sign and broadcast that commitment transaction, he would immediately send four bitcoins to Alice... and he would have to wait 1000 blocks to claim his own six bitcoins. That's a problem, because now that Alice knows his secret, she could use this time to beat Bob to the punch, and claim the other six bitcoins as well!"

This. Each wallet can have their policy of derivation so the relevant keys are in branches of a huge tree. Stick to your wallet and to your mnemonic.
@_date: 2017-08-17 11:12:12
Every choice is a trade off. This is basically my opinion in this case. Also if the other key is kept by on other person, the risk could be higher or lower depending on his trustability, health, etc.

Reason 1 has been debunked so many time I wouldn't deserve an answer but here is my own: what has inherent value in this world? IMHO what a) has utility b) is scarce. Here we get a little circular but for me bitcoin being able to store and to transfer value without relying on a central teusted party able to censor you, has got a lot of sense and utility. For scarcity you already know the answer...
Reason 2: well then what?
Nothing is priced in gold too. I don't think this is so necessary. Eventually bitcoin could become a mean of payment (we hope so). Little by little goods may be priced in bitcoin and little by little the pricing will be less volatile but now I'm not  dyeing for it.
Reason 3: yes. You bet, but this is not the end of the story. As the technology and the adoption come, bitcoin will be used for machine to machine payments, smart contracts and, in general, all the types of payment that the traditional system cannot cover because is linked to banking hours, censorship conditions etc.

When you configure an hardware wallet for the first time, it shows you the seed ONE ONLY TIME. That is the time you must write it down like it was the most important moment in your financial history (and to some extent it is). 
@_date: 2017-08-18 14:02:04
Then the best thing you can do is to **encrypt the mnemonic** which contains the seed which generates all your private keys.
IIRC Greenaddress uses BIP38 to encrypt a BIP39 mnemonic but in alternative you can use any other encryption tool you know (I would use GPG).
@_date: 2017-08-17 10:38:12
Vanity addresses then. I see. Pay attention with spending from them. Do it once and for all when it comes the moment.
Single addresses have in general three issues:
* change: if you are not perfectly aware wher the change is going and you are not sweeping the private key, you risk to loose the money
* If you spend from an address but put the change on the same address, from that moment the address is less secure because you have revealed your public key to the world
* If you spend from and address many times and your wallet is not good enough in producing the r value in a random way there is mor possibility for a private key leak.
You can add to all this that everybody now knows that that address is linked to your reddit handle and you are leaking all the relative incoming and outgoing transactions.
If you are fine with all this, it's ok but I would sweep your Vanities into an hardware wallet. :P
@_date: 2017-08-18 14:08:04
When you configure the Ledger Nano S, the software asks you to take note of the 24 words mnemonic.

Emphasy is mandatory. This will not be repeated enough.

DISCLAIMER: Greenaddress former investor and sustainer here. I speak mainly as a Greenaddress user and I'm not authorized by the company to speak in its name.
I think Greenaddress is the wallet for those who strongly believe in the success of Bitcoin and see the past and the future contentious hard forks as a threat to this goal. 
It is hard when you deal with security to safely give the opportunity of speculating on the new hard fork with associated airdrop coming.
I know that this is frustrating in a way but it is also extremely coherent. I think that in the future the company will continue to focus on security and innovation. I could be wrong and I don't speak for the company but this is still what I'm looking in a wallet. Trading and speculation maybe is not for Greenaddress and I'm confortable with it.
As for the feature: "direct connection to private bitcoind server" I would like to give a tip: Greenbits is the only wallet capable of connecting to **multiple** bitcoind servers you control or trust (comma separated) and also through TOR. This is still one of the  exclusive functionalities Greenaddress has security-wise I would like to see in other wallets. The usage of Hardware wallet with the mobile is an other one.
EDIT: Please take care of your seed **AND** of your second factor (possibly configuring more than one). Loosing one of them is not advisable (edited last sentence).
@_date: 2017-08-17 10:22:39
Ok. If your wallet is an hardware one, I see no reason to keep them separate. In Ledger for instance you can use Accounts to keep them separated while on the same hardware wallet.

@_date: 2016-11-09 11:31:46
Great video. I don't remember if its handle is and I hope he can confirm what I'm saying but mainly in his video he talks about the possibility of discovering your addresses through the exam of bloom filters, when with your spv client you connect to random bitcoin nodes.
Here the key aspect is that you **connect only with few nodes you can trust in an encrypted mode (tor).**
So nobody in principle can see what you are querying and nobody can examine your bloom filters.
There are many ways in which your privacy in this case is not perfect (for instance your wallet provider could know in other ways which are your addresses) but, in this kind of setup, the risks he indicates are mainly avoided.
@_date: 2017-08-17 10:53:56
mixers are services in which you send the money and they send you back the money in (hopefully) non traceable addresses after sometime for a fee. They are risky because nobody can assure you the transaction back and because you have to trust their behaviour in general (they could leak informations about their operations).
Lightning Networks forms a layer over the blockchain where users have interconnected bilateral and bi-diretional channels through which your payment can be vehiculated. 
They are in active development by a group of startups and many like me think is most exciting thing happened after the Satoshi's whitepaper.
If they will be widely adopted you will be able to pay anyone in no time for a negligible fee and to settle the sum of your payments just once in a while on the blockchain. If you settle all your payments once every six months for instance the only public data will be the result of the sum of all your transactions.

@_date: 2016-11-05 19:39:59
The reason of not reusing the same address multiple times is because:
1. Anyone can see how much money you receive and spend just looking at it
2. When you spend from an address you reveal to the world the relative public key. This is considered a degradation in the security of your funds because addresses are much more secure than public keys to future cryptographic attacks.
When you spend from an address you spend the entire amount of it and if the amount you need to send is inferior the remaining amount (rest) goes to a newly generated address in your control. If you return the rest to the same address your seeking trouble also because...
3. when you use your private key to sign a transaction you have to generate a truly random number called "R" factor. If you sign multiple transactions with the same private key it is possible to interpolate and find your private key.

The Bitcoin Network relies on nodes. 
These nodes receive and transmits all the candidate transactions, they verify them, few of them are the place where the miners pick up them for the mining activity. When a block is mined by the miners the receive it the check its validity and they add it to their copy of the blockchain.
To run a node of your own is what allows you to have the  ledger of all the transactions in the world and to be sure the accounting is right not needing to rely on a trusted third party. When you receive a transaction your node is able to validate it and to state the bitcoins are "true", that they are not created from thin-air and that nobady is cheating you in general with algebric or mathematic tricks.
Bitcoin Core is the most wide spread, used, reliable implementation of a full node.
If you are using a mobile wallet or a so called "light client", you are trusting someone's else node, the client is connected to.

Well they are distributed at best or federated. Decentralized is a step further IMHO.


Mining in this case would just an unusual waste of resources. A multisig configuration would fit much more. Banks would be recognized and the access to the network would be permissioned so you don't need necessarily to hide the participants which instead must be recognized and kept accountable for their actions.


Here I've lost you. It is not comparable IMO because is not permissionless, probably even not totally trustless and in no manner censorship resistant.


Just because it would be permissioned and the access to the network would be regulated. A big part of the defense of the bitcoin network against spam attacks is by the use of  fees. In a banking private blockchain fees would much likely be collected with a different scheme.


Not so much so IMO. distributed systems are expensive. If the unique ledger is duplicated in thousands of computer around the world, network latency would end up playing a role and consensus process, even if by multisig instead of mining would be more expansive and less scalable than a single big database with a master-slaves structure.
If you ask me (but many people I admire wouldn't agree with me) the only use case for private blockchains is not money but distributed trust in general at the cost of a more clumsy system compared to a central database.
Consider land registration for instance: As a citizen you could feel somehow more confident if you know that your land is in a distributed database in which no government can cheat unless a majority of them collude. 
The database wouldn't be optimized and absolutely permissioned and not censorship resistant but your title would depend on the possession of the private key despite any claim also your government could have. These kinds of use cases are the only ones worth exploring in private blockchains but with many caveats anyway and I'm not even sure they would bring some real advantage.

@_date: 2017-11-11 08:10:32
The most important development status about lightning network is here at the moment 
It's the report of the tests on interoperability among the three implementation.
The last 6 tests are probably the most difficult to fix (as always happens) but they are also the most complex (multi hops payments).
When the three implementations will be interoperable, there will be of course other risks and we will have to proceed carefully but it will be an historical date.

Write to me if you need to swap. I still have some Bitcoin cash...

BIP70. Bitpay and Coinbase both support it. When you click a button or scan a qr code on a coinbase or Bitpay supported site for a payment, your wallet (if it supports the payment protocol) is filled up with the name of the firm instead of the address and the amount is filled too (as well as other things are happening under the woods like the payer informs about an eventual return payment address).
@_date: 2017-11-13 07:45:15
But you have an alternative now. Go to Bitcoin cash. That's your cryptocurrency: 8 Mb blocks, Blockstream not involved, no second layer solutions, sponsored and sustained by Bitcoin Jesus (AKA Roger Ver) and Craig Wright among other cypherpunks. 
Let me know if you need some bitcoin cash off market...

There's a change in the spec ongoing. Eclair had a different behaviour in the sequence of establishing a routed payment. It turns out their approach was more sound, so they are changing the spec and modifying the three implementations. Obviously is not a straight forward process but we are very very close.
@_date: 2015-08-02 21:36:04
I do believe that bitcoins has inner value.
I do believe this value derives directly from the use of the network.
I would so much seeing bitcoin scale.
I don't think increasing blocks without being sure about the consequences to be wise period.

It's some time I read and hear stuff by Mr. Todd and I have rarely caught him being wrong (if any). 
I don't like his tone but I have to admit he has always been very open to the discussion (sometime too much IMHO) and very sincere.
Normally I don't agree with what he says. After months I end up feeling I was wrong and he was right. So I find extremely useful his presence in the community. And I thank him at least as much as I thank Gavin to be part of this community.

IIRC you receive a first version of the .ots file containing the present version of the merkle tree.
The merkle path change over time as you said and I think the structure of the tree is probably a MMR (Merkle Mountain Range) or a Patricia tree more than a strict Merkle tree.
When the tree is considered closed, the merkle root is written into a bitcoin transaction and this is included into a block. At that point and only at that point, the .ots file includes all the merkle path until the block header and the notarization can be considered complete (re-orgs apart).

Bitcoin is essentially the people getting back in control of their own money.
If you are not relying on your own node (for instance to get your balance) you are using a version of Bitcoin that is somehow weaker because you rely the knowledge of how much you own to an other entity and you have a weaker control of your own bitcoins.
In this regard I agree completely with Luke-jr even if I find the quote too strong for a superficial reader if taken out of the context.

I don't know OP and I don't know his personal conflict of interest.
For what I read, the accusation (it doesn't seem to me a simple declaration of facts) is weak and it lack of substance. the advantage they could gain from a capped block is theoretical and inconsistent.
I think spending all this time trying to advocate the reason for a reasonable progressive increasing to sponsor a theoretical future dynamic competitive advantage is a really really poor business plan.
Mike Hearn supports straw pay (and payment channels) since before blockstream supported LN. Mike Hearn is good Blockstream is bad?


There are many things interesting in this post. Is also well written. This above is instead a falsity.  
Theese are just three random examples of blockstream's members looking to find consensus on HOW safely increase the blocksize. All publicly posted and open for discussion. There are also voices who preferes that the blocksize stay like this but none of the blockstream developers has ever refused to talk about blocksize increase. 
Sometime I cannot understand why someone who writes so well could let himself write something like that.

One important thing is omitted here IMO.
The recipient of the message must have the public key to verify the signature. Unless the public key is included in the signature or the address appears in a transaction on the blockchain as input (in which case the corrisponding public key is also provvided) the receiver of the signed message should not be able to verify the signature.
@_date: 2015-07-15 03:45:01
When you are reading about decentralisation in bitcoin context it doesn't refer to the distribution of transactioon recording of course.
The term decentralisation refers only to the lack of an entity appointed to decide what the actual state of the pubblic ledger is.
Of course you can find all the transactions in one only place and they are therefore centralized. Of course you can find a greater extent of data distribution in the actual banking system under that point of view. But that is NOT what we mean for decentralization here.

That's my guess too but theoretically it could be prepared too by moving a bunch of coins on the two chains with an nlocktime and then trying to double spend the tx on a different address: the attempt fail miserably on the faster chain in which the first tx is already confirmed on one address (nlocktime is passed) and has success on the other, because the first tx has not even been accepted by the slower network. So on this slow network the first tx is successfully double spent on a different address.
In this way you prepare some split outputs you can use with the same properties of coinbase coins. It is somehow less safe and useful if you cannot access to coinbase coins.

I had the same experience with Bitstamp 2/22/2014.
Here's my report: 
Many similarities in my opinion:
* My password was unguessable inside a password manager
* I had 2FA as well on Bitstamp
* Each withdrawal had to be confirmed by email.
* My gmail account HADN'T 2FA!!! as well and was hacked and accessed through TOR (as I discovered later)
To summarize: 2FA on the exchange IS NOT ENOUGH. 
If they can hack your email they can evidently do what they have done.
I will never discover how they did but accept my suggestion:
Please enable 2FA on your mail account if you use it on exchanges.

This is what Bitcoin need: Metaphors and other tools to make complex projects understandable in their basic working principles. 
To me it has clarified once and for all the specific contribute of CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY: when one of the two parties bump the transaction onto the blockchain it is extremely useful and flexible that the contract has an interval to be effective **starting from that moment**. With CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY the moment in which the funds are redeemable is in a fixed moment in time making the channels much harder to manage.

Immediately Massimo involved us and gave us the editorial plan. We took one piece each and wrote. Massimo joined everything together, summarized a lot and we reviewed the things all together on a google doc.
In the end Massimo delivered to Il Sole 24 ore who changed something again.
Some of our contributions were stripped away, my name is on an article I don't recognize but in the end we are proud to have been the guys behind it.

Well no because this doesn't make the bogus transaction invalid.
So even if the recipient publish the right transaction the system simpy doesn't accept it.
You cannot invalidate a confirmed transaction.
Instead each transaction has a trick that makes it potentially horrible for the payer in the case he publish it after it has been declared obsolete by both the parties.
Obviously the transaction become potentially  extremely inconvenient  for the payer with a specific action the parties make when they agree on the new state of their accounts. I this way they *almost* invalidate the old state by making it extremely inconvenient for the party who could take advantage in publishing it.
This is explained well [here](

Non professional answer:
It makes a transaction spendable after a defined number of blocks since when the transaction was accepted into the Blockchain.
While CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY makes a transaction spendable after a defined moment in the future (expressed in date and time or in a determined block number), CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY will be relative to the moment in which the transaction has been confirmed (i.e. it will make it spendable after n block from the one in which it was confirmed).

Blockchain.info has been a pioneer in many fields in the early days.
As the technology evolved they had not enough tech people and enough commitment to risk their user base to evolve with it.
They have chosen to develop marketing and to build something "new" underneath. They have made a choice and time will tell if it has been the right thing to do.
The problem IMO is that now they come out with a new product with a two year old technology as the main feature. 
Something that has been adopted by all the wallets out there more than one year ago. Not very interesting to me.

Thank you. I can't understand this though:"If a minority of the hash power (under 51%) follows BIP148, nodes running BIP148 will be fine, but those not running BIP148 will be out of consensus with the rest of the economy. In this scenario, the more of the economy that runs BIP148, the better. Miners will find it difficult to sell their coins leading economically motivated miners to start enforcing BIP148."
According to my understanding, if less than 50% will support BIP148 there will likely be a split and BIP148 nodes will not be fine at all unless a huge economic majority is on board (luke write about 100%).

Segwit is mainly a mean to get rid of transaction malleability that is the main obstacle for chains of unconfirmed transaction to keep consistency. Chain transactions are necessary to build lightning networks in a practical and usable forms and other kinds of smart contracts.
This is a non technical explanation based on my personal knowledge please refer to the proposals for accuracy.
Extension blocks are a sort of auxiliary blocks attached to a normal block that permits to extend the present capacity of the normal block by storing additional traansactions in this block. In these blocks transaction malleability is also resolved.
Segwit also allow [many other improvements]( to the actual  protocol like an abnormal escalation of cpu required to elaborate multiple inputs in a transaction and a script versioning that in turn will allow further improvements like MAST, and Schnorr signature and it has been already coded and tested for more than a year.
Also it transform the witness of a transaction in a non compulsory element to carry around for ever but that can be just considered as granted ones your node has verified it. In this regard Segwit allow, for the client who supports it, a discount of 75% on the weight that the transaction has in the block for the purpose of the calculation of the space occupied, allowing an effective increase of the capacity of the network in general and in a discount on the calculated fee for the transaction composed according to the protocol.
Extension blocks pose a challenge in the amount of space on the dimension of blocks the nodes will be compelled to store and to verify because at the present moment the size of the extension block has not been decided.
A full validating node must verify the block and the extension block as well. It was possible to implement various degree of validation of transactions and blocks in past version of the idea, but it is not clear to me how they will be implemented in the present proposal.
This is my take at the moment. I hope this is useful to you to dig more into the matter.
EDIT: typos
EDIT2: An other feature of Segwit is that the inputs will carry also the amount of the transaction making the signing of the inputs extremely more straight forward for devices like hardware wallets.

AFAIR Ledger was one of the few companies that refused to sign the NYA.
Every effort was done to bring them onboard in terms of moral suasion and interpretation of their effort to avoid a break with DCG.
I remember that was a very tense moment but I clearly remember they took all the possible initiatives to stay neutral and to protect user funds. That what a responsible company does in that situation. I also know what u/btchip thought about the agreement at the time but he always tried to protect users in the first place.
I know they could have taken a more clean stance on the matter but they didn't.
I don't know what is the point here. If you want to support Trezor because of a better Ethos you are welcome but as far as the products, Ledger makes a very high quality product even if they are more open about shitcoins.

Permissioned ledgers are not compatible with the concept of proof of work.
In a permissioned ledger the bizantine general problem is as of today solved by giving some subject the power/duty to maintain the  network fair by voting through signing the actual state of the ledger. The ledger is certified by the large majority of these subjects.
Proof of work has been invented for a system in which the actors don't know and don't trust each other. That's why you cannot get your head around it.

Interesting write up.
It confirm in part what I thought about the present situation.
It is very difficult for me to express opinions on the implementations because I'm trying to support all of them in all the way I can and I'm impressed about the passion all the teams are putting into this revolution.
For what it is my poor understanding C is a very hard but interesting choice.
In My personal opinion the aim of C-lightning is to build the more close-to-metal primitives and modules to be used by higher layer programs. C has a great portability on  OS and platforms and this could be one of the reasons why chosing this difficult road. 
They are trying to speed up the development and the construction of a community and  their choice to go on mainnet could be seen as one of the reasons why,  They are trying hard to fix the bugs as they arise and they are very supportive.
C-lightning on mainnet is for very skilled and motivated programmers or for people who want to be able to tell one day that have lost some satoshi for the cause (like me...).
Lnd seems a more mature implementation and it can run with bitcoind as well as neutrino that is probably the best by-product of the development in this environment (as stated by u/adreasma in the last episode of let's talk bitcoin). The effort of the team in building and supporting a growing community is also incredible. Their slack is a paradise of insights.
Their node  may be probably the most reliable to be used on mainnet now but they are strongly advising not to do it. With the next imminent release (two weeks^TM ;) probably the advice will be less mandatory.
I haven't tried Eclair yet but from their acting I would say they are trying to focus on providing working solutions as fast as they can, putting less focus on the community involvement and also this could be a good strategy (they are obtaining incredible results so far -&gt; Strike).
Then to the environment:
Testnet is probably the way to go but the glitches of the network could confuse your ability to debug. OTOH mainnet is obviously reliable but you are going to risk your money.
The only thing I know about the Rust implementation is that u/thebluematt  is heavily involved and that's enough to expect wonderful things in the future.
You guys are heroes,  pretty much like bitcoiners in 2009.
(I'm running a c-lightning node on mainnet and a lnd node on testnet. Strangely enough, is not simple to test payments between them :0)

I agree and I could express myself better. What I mean is that wallet interoperability based on standards is in its infancy.
We can say that BIP39, BIP32 and BIP44 are established standards. 
They are far from perfect in design, but they have been used by most wallets for years and they have already solved many problems.
We are anyway far from the possibility to use one seed in different wallets in a reliable way today.

* Electrum for desktop (very flexible). Better use your own server (better Electrs written in rust)
   * simple but powerful
   * You can use your hardware wallet with many multisig combination possible
   * 2Fa optional
   * Manual coin selection
   * Total spending of single outputs
   * Hardware wallets support
* Eclair for lightning (you cannot receive yet but it is the more tested and it is very simple).
I haven't found what I'm looking for and it should be not that hard:
* Pure SPV (or Electrum) with the possibility to connect to your node/nodes via Tor (no one know your addresses hopefully)
* total possession of your funds
* hardware wallet support

No. They are in part hot wallets and in part cold wallets but both of them are managed by the entity owning the private keys.
A cold wallet managed by an entity is safer from theft but obviously not from misbehaving or censorship by the entity.
I define the wallet cold if the device and the keys are air gapped from a host connected to the Network.
If you stretch the concept also hardware wallet aren't totally "cold".  I would say "almost".
All the desktop and mobile applications are hot wallets if they can perform signatures and being connected.

Transactions are the way in which we change the state of the ledger.
Bitcoins are always traped into Unspent Transaction Outputs, protected by a script.

Hardware wallets never expose the private keys to the outside You cannot read them even if you have the device.

ELI5:opentimestamp sottware take your document, hash it, join it with the hash of the hash of an other document of the many it has collected in the same batch it has collected. Then it it hash it again and it joins the hash with the resulting hash of the preceding or following couple of documents of the batch. It repeats the same operation many times to form a merkle tree of all the documents in the batch. This operation is performed into one or more of what it's called a "calendar server".
The resulting merkle root inside the calendar server is then put into a bitcoin transaction.
The file .ots contains all the resulting hash operations untill the merkle root and, when the transaction is confirmed, it's updated with all the hashing operation performed inside the block up to the merkle root written into the block header.
In this way the .ots file contains all the hashing operation to reproduce the merkle proof that only that document could be included in that block in the original form.
I think you can find a bunch of more technical and detailed explanations on opentimestamp.org.
Calendar servers are kept on a voluntary base and it is a good thing to show them your support (especially in time of increasing fees).

Contains hashing operations means that it litterally describe the operations necessary to build the merkle path up to the merkle root. Something like: "prepend to the hash of your document this hash", "hash with sha256", "append the resulting hash with this other hash", "hash with sha256", etc..

I think pretty much the same. Miners verify transactions because in the opposite case they would risk to loose the reward but their main task is to give transactions a chronological order. They are like a sausage machine: they collect the meat and they make sausages...
Many miners don't verify transactions (even if they should), but all of them create money, so I put that answer even if is not convincing either.

Calendar servers aggregate a batch of documents to be certified. So your document ends up in a batch with let's say thousends of other documents. You care only about the merkle tree formed by these docs. You don't really care about the documents after the batch and also about the hashes of the majority of the docs of your batch too.
 
To prove the existence of a document inside a merkle root you just need what is called the merkle path. 
This is a very restricted group of hashes and hashing operations that proofs cryptographically the presence of the hash of your document inside the merkle tree.
For instance in a merkle tree of 256 elements you need only 8 hashes and relative hashing operations ( in general log(n) IIRC).
You don't need ANY document after you have "timestamped" yours because your document is ALREADY timestamped together with the others.

The Blockchain is a new concept and every big corporation is trying to take advantage on the not established meaning.
The Blockchain IS NOT a database is an interface to a database. Every blockchain has a database as a backend. Bitcoin Core has Level db as its backend database.
The pure and original Blockchain is permissionless as everyone of us knows. That doesn't imply that a permissioned blockchain cannot exist. It just start with a big handicap (or a feature depending on the different point of view).
I'm personally in love with the permissionless concept of Bitcoin Blockchain but I am also curious whether a private blockchain can bring someone any advantage.

I don't know how or why but I think bitcoin hacking to be linked to the unique feature MtGox had. You could deposit your private key instead of making a transaction.
If you are a miner, you could deposit the private key related to a coinbase transaction and MtGox wasn't able to sweep it for many blocks after. I don't know how but maybe you could " double sweep" the coins as soon they were being allowed to be spent leaving MtGox with spent output to sweep and maybe the deposit already registered on the depositor's account.

This because I think I don't have to ask permission to move my own money and to pay many middlemen to investigate over me and over my counterpart given also the fact that it normally takes at least five days to have the money to destination due to their crappy procedures.

If you can mine an empty block and this give you a competitive advantage on those who collect and verify transactions to build a block, you always will tend to do it. Miners will tend to mine an increasing number of empty blocks making the difficulty increase in the long run in a oddly manner without actually confirming transactions for the network.
It is not intrinsically wrong (you can do it) but we all are trying to make this less convenient for a miner giving him the same advantages without loosing competitivity against who will continue to SPV mine.
@_date: 2018-04-23 01:12:12


Right. My fault. I confused the recent performance improvement for gain in terms of space and cpu but they are such only if compared with rangeproofs.
Schnorr gives more than a 25% if joined with transaction aggregation because the gain in space grow with the number of the signature involved (I have read about around a 40% gains under particular conditions). IIRC this is due to the fact that the length of the combined signature is always the same even if the number of the signatures grows. 
Public sidechains seem to be non trustless. Private blockchain are not trustless in an evident way but they can be a test field for new scaling technologies.

The total liquidity of **B** hasn't changed just for the reason of being an intermediary. Just the liquidity of his channel with **C**.
Every transaction change the balance in at least one of your channels.
If you act as an intermediary in at least two. As an intermediary you don't loose liquidity. You just change the balances in your channels. You have decreased the liquidity in your **B**&lt;-&gt;**C** channel by 0.5 btc but you have increased the liquidity in the **A**&lt;-&gt;**B** channel by the same amount.
EDIT: I would add that now **B** could be interested in rebalance his channel with **C**.
This is where negative fees potentially can become possible. **B** could tell **C** that he is inclined in paying something if he would use their channel to pay someone. In this way he could rebalance the channel.

After you download the entire blockchain for verifying purposes you can choose to prune it. Your disk space use will be reduced but your full node will work as it is supposed to and you will be part of the network in the very sense.
@_date: 2015-11-29 08:14:57
There is not such a thing as "the mempool". Each of the 5000+ nodes has its own and no one can assert in a trustless way which is the first one seen on the network full stop.
Maybe this is one of the biggest misunderstanding in this debate.
If one transaction is not written on a unified and universally recognized ledger is mainly just a unreliable information.

I'm afraid there are not so many companies out there who can afford a permanent presence in the working group.
I admire your effort but W3C relaying on big organizations remains an institution keen to expensive lobbying. Not judging but without a BIG effort also from the inside the organization, the W3C payments' work will become just an other standard so complex and obscure made by big organizations for big organizations and for big companies payment systems (Paypal, Visa, Mastercard, etc...) and the community will look at something else (SOAP I'm looking at you).
It is incredible how even when we talk about standards there are some many centrifugal forces pushing for individual interests while there would be a so big advantage in a very simple standard that everybody could use improving exponentially the "Metcalfe" effect.
I have to admit that engineers have their own sins in forgetting the "Keep-it-simple-stupid" rule but big companies are not good in establishing standards for the community IMHO.
TL;DR: W3C should take a stronger stance in favor of Bitcoin because without a strong effort it is unlikely that companies in the Bitcoin space will afford to contibute. And lastly please [KISS](

I may add that you can record your encrypted seed on a Nfc tag or on a Qr code. When you need to open Greenaddress you could just tap your encrypted nfc tag on your phone and input your password.

Miners are not exactly known to be research companies but surely a good fee policy could help a lot.

No. As of today the new addresses will be segwit "incorporated" into p2sh addresses so they will start with "3".

Yeah. If we could have a method to forbid the use of bitcoin blockchain Core would probably have used it and for good. Problem is blockchain is there and anyone can use it in anyway allowed by the conensus as long as they pay the right fees. It's like saying fire should be used just for harmless purposes... Timestamping is not that bad as a use and done through merkleization has the minimum impact possible.
OP_RETURN was put in place (by Gavin) to give transparency to this kind of utilization and as an alternative to (the many) hidden methods.
People *will* write on the blockchain and, if they pay their fee and do it in a minimum impact way, well... I can live with that. It's part of the permissionlessness.

Yes but they can be isolated from your control if someone steals your private keys and send your funds to keys he controls (always on the blockchain of course).
Hardware wallets are conceived for security from the hardware through the OS to the interface. The have a very small attack surface for malaware and so they are a much safer way to store your private keys (that give you the power to spend) than normal PCs.
They also have the software to make you spend the bitcoins safely without revealing your private key not even to the external of the device.

Ledger absolutely. Cheaper, more handy, with Greenbits you can use it with your mobile, your seed is in a secure element.
The screen is missing but you can have some ways to be enough confident of where you are sending the transaction.
This said Trezor or Keep keys are hardware wallets and as such much better in keeping your coins than on a computer.

Well I know the way Greenbits and Greenaddress do by sending sms or email (now pgp encrypted) with the details of the transactions that you have to confirm. 
Everything is hackable but I find this level of confidence enough for me. That's the meaning of my stance.


I wrote "your seed is in a secure element" before. My following stance was not accurate as you notice. I use a wide spread metaphor for brevity.
Thank you for pointing out that.

the bandwith increase is not relevant for miners if the OP_RETURN transaction pays the right fee. For them it's absolutely the same
@_date: 2015-10-19 00:15:18
I think you are being downvoted because:
1. Paper wallets encourage address reuse
2. Paper wallets are safe as long as you don't actually spend the coins (and reveal a potentially big public key).
3. Spending money in a proper way from a Paper Wallet is not trivial and could be tricky due to the change treatment issue.
4. Also in preparing your paper wallet you have to be very careful and to do the things properly.
This make paper wallets questionable if you don't know exactly what you are doing.
Sorry for the missing references.  
@_date: 2015-10-19 00:15:32
I prefer Ledger: it lacks the screen but the seed is inside a secure element. There have been some attacks on Trezor hardware. On the other hand it's very expensive to compromise a secure element.

Liquid is a sidechain and as such it *could* support Confidential Transactions and Issued Assets (two part of Elements). One exchange could issue USD or EUR or any other currency IOUs. 
These are obviously informed speculations. Everything depend on the rules that the pool of the signers decide to write into the code. 
I don't think they will start with a full capable liquid network but they could for sure implement also atomic swap in the future.
This is what I can sum up from what I can understand.

The limitations in TCP/IP in the beginning were the IP address numbers. I remember everyone saying they were finishing in few years and they started to develop IPv6.
In the reality the problem was solved in a different way: developing subnets and intranets which, exactly like sidechains allowed for custom applications, experimenting, private stuffs and much better throughputs inside companies.
@_date: 2015-11-12 16:26:33
Exchanges, tipping applications and centralized wallets (Coinbase, Circle, Xapo, etc.) are already functioning and they represent methods to do offchain transactions that give relief to the main blockchain.

Users are happy to send and to guard the money on themselves without relating with financial institutions and miners are happy to process transactions in the hope and legitimate expectation of the reward. The only missing ring are the full nodes and we hope in the future this altruistic part of the network will keep on.

CSV, Checksequence verify is a group of changes that will allow to send the btc to a script that will lock them until a specified number of blocks or a specified time has passed since the funding transaction has been confirmed (has entered into a block).
We need it because is the more flexible "time related" condition we have had until now in the script. The other currently possible are:
* nlocktime that doesn't even allow you to broadcast the transaction if the blockchain hasn't reached a specified height (expressed in the block number) or a specified date and time has not passed
* Checkloctimeverify that make a transaction spendable only if a particular moment in time has been reached (in block number or in date and time). In this case the transaction can be broadcast and confirmed.
Checksequenceverify is something similar but it is in relative time (or blocks) since the moment (or block) in which the transaction being spent has been confirmed on the blockchain. It is very useful for smart contract and simplify a lot the implementations of bidirectionals payment channels.

AFAIK Alpha elements based on testnet.
Liquid has some time ahead yet (little more than two weeks^TM).
The main obstacles right now might be:
* Not easy to deploy (but I heard that Blockstream is preparing something like an "easy" installable kit)
* Not completely trustless (you need some form of "permission" to take the BTCs back from the sidechains). In this regard there are few hypothesis on how to implement the two way deterministic peg necessary to take back the money in a permissionless way.
* Not easy to reproduce a good consensus system alternative to the POW. Liquid is based on trusted devices (the functionaries) who sign the blocks. Other concepts are based on merge mining or on a mix of the two.

Seen and used the sweeping feature on Gox, Never seen it on BTC-E.
I'm convinced that the feature was very problematic. Think what would happen when you try to sweep a private key for newly generated coin.

Tips for different levels of security in one account:
Make one subaccount 2of3 for long term storage of the large part of your bitcoins and keep the main (2of2) account for daily expenses taking advantage of the instant confirmation feature (with supported merchants or other greenaddress' users).
From time to time you can refill your main (2of2) account from the 2of3 subaccount. 
If anything could happen to greenaddress you will have the large part of your bitcoins immediatly redeemable without asking anything to anyone.
You can also make your daily expenses more handy renouncing to 2fa for expenses till the amount you have choosen in the "limits" part of the settings.
If this last part is a bit complex to manage for you an alternative set up also involving hardware wallets is:
Keep you HW1 or ledger wallet with also a 2of3 subaccount for the suggested use but with the added protection of an hardware wallet and open an other greenbits wallet with no 2fa for the very tiny and fast expenses eventually pin protected.

Well as I see it, we won't all be using Lightning tomorrow morning. Lightning must be tested and there are systemic risks that must be investigated. I personally immagine that in the first 6 months we will have no more than few thousands of channels open on the main net.
For these the blocksize increase given by SegWit is more than enough. If everything goes well, in one year maybe some big merchant will open some channel but then we will probably have something else prepared. Please consider also the increase given by Schnorr signature in the meanwhile.

Electrum is queried as an additional verification of your wallet balance in the unlikely event  Greenaddress' nodes being compromised.
Frankly I would not care too much if this additional method sometime happens to lag.
What it seems to be a problem is in reality due to the attempt to be as reliable as possible diversifying the method to verify the balance of you wallet.
Also Greenaddress has recently added the SPV method over TOR and you can also specify the node you trust.

The first one is an attack to bitcoin network based on spamming. The network is filled with spamming transactions and normal transaction have to wait hours to go through. It is performed by coinwallet.eu with the declare purpose of stress testing the network.
The second attack is the massive cloning of normal transactions which led to umpredictable outcomes on which one of two resulting transactions will be confirmed on the blockchain. theoretically it shouldn't matter but some wallet allow you to spend unconfirmed output from previous transactions and, in the particular case in which you are referring to a transaction that has been cloned and confirmed with a different ID, you will broadcast a non confirmable transaction increasing the caos provoked by the massive cloning.


The Bitcoin network is solid and working if the majority of the power calculation that must certify the blockchain is "honest" in the meaning it follows the rules every partecipant in the network expects. 
If a "dishonest" subject reach the majority of the power calculation necessary to write the blockchain he can avoid the rules and certify transactions not normally valid among which also double spending transactions. He also can refuse blocks mined by other and do other thing which would destroy the credibility of the network.

Two years ago blockchain.info was one of the few web wallets and didn't keep your private keys. 
It was an innovative feature back then. It had also the only iOS wallet.
Then in the bitcoin space came so many innovations and security practices such as:
* address reuse was way way more deprecated
* HD wallet with bip 32 fo wallet backup and addresses management
* multisig for better security
Blockchain.info went on capitalizing on its initial success and lack of competition without doing any innovation and suffering from some important security breach (I am referring of course to the random number generation issue).
So IMHO address reuse is not the only reason to stay clear from blockchain.info wallet.
The main reason is their strategy toward innovation and security (i.e. None).

Yes. Now I see. You are responsible forthemerchant funds only from the moment the payment is received to the moment you send them to the merchant's wallet (2 minutes on average on each payment).
You may consider BIP32 for the wallet of your application just to be able to backup all the addresses in one seed but in your setup it is not necessary as you mentioned. 


That's very wise of you. Just consider though that if the purchases are of small amount transaction fees could start to be an issue in the future and you may want to save a couple of transaction in the process (allowing the merchant to keep the amounts in the wallet of your application and spend them only if necessary).
Richard Kiss has written a wonderful BIP32 library for python called pycoin with an easy command line utility to generate BIP32 addresses. If you rethink your app give it a look.

Accounting is an old deprecated feature. Stay away from it. Use just the default "" account.
The seed is the "core" from which all your private keys, public keys and addresses are generated (AKA BIP32 wallets).
To get things a bit confused "accounts" is also the name given to the first derivation of the seed but not yet in this software context.

Greenwallet is nothing bitcoin related.
Greenaddress.it is a multisig wallet which act as a co-custodian of your funds. You cannot spend if either you or greenaddress don't sign the transaction.
But what if Grenaddress is blackmailed or is trying to hold your funds indefinitely?
When you deposit funds into the Greenaddress wallet it sends you a transaction which will be accepted by the network only in the future (nlocktime) that sends all the funds you now have in common with Greenaddress.it to an address that only you control. 
In this way you can safely keep your funds in common with them and if anything happen you can use the "emergency transaction" to have back your funds.

I have read many tutorials. That's why frankly I prefer to use ledger.
I think paper wallets done properly are the best possibility we have to HODL but it is very hard for an ordinary person like me to follow all the prescriptions.

It is als the only one to support three kind of hardware wallets (Trezor, HW1/Ledger and NFC Ledger) for enhanced security.
They use HDM (Hyrarchical Deterministic Multisig) to provide added security and instant confirmations.
They DON'T let you choose the 24 words passphrase to generate the seed (users are NOT good at it).
For these reasons and others they are also one of safest bitcoin wallet to date.

No information is shared with anyone until/unless you send money to the address you have created. When you send bitcoins TO the address the address will appear on the blockchain for the first time.
When you spend them also the public key is revealed on the blockchain.

The most "dogmatic": 
1. download [Bitcoin core]( sync your blockchain (at least one day of downloading and verifying)
2. get a receive address (if you want print it) let someone send you some bitcoins or fractions of them. You can also obtain them trough [faucets](
3. play with them by sending them around to friends and Non Profit Organizations like [Sean Outpost]( Each transaction will cost you about 0.05$ in fees.
The fastest: 
1. subscribe to Coinbase
2. link your bank account
3. Get verified
4. buy some bits
5. Play with them
In this case you are NOT in possession of your private keys and you cannot verify the transaction with a software you run.
Compromise: make yourself an SPV wallet or a wallet with which you don't control a node but in which you control the keys and obtain some bits as in the first hypothesis:

It's pretty simple. If you have the control on where to spend your money despite what your provider wants, then you are in control of your money. Better if your provider don't even know where your money are spent or where they come from.
If your provider can even freeze your money for an amount of time he decides then you are not in full control of your money.
The edge case here is Greenaddress in which you can choose to manage your money in common with the provider but for a period of time YOU choose and you do so to have one fair advantage (instant confirmation).

Total size is the block size in bytes with transactions serialized as described in BIP144, including base data and witness data.
The new rule is block weight ≤ 4,000,000."
From: 
EDIT: "The normal case without pathologically large/giant fee Segwit transactions results in a block size of around 2MB, which is what the creators of Segwit designed for. When you hear someone say “Segwit is a block size increase”, this is what they’re referring to. The average Segwit block size will be roughly 2MB, though Legacy nodes will still receive blocks that are 1,000,000 bytes or lower due to stripped witness data."

Agreed. You give full accountability to them and also create a potential security problem: if they happen to have only one of your derivate private keys they have all the others associated with the xPub.
I would say uploading your xPub anywhere you are not in full and exclusive control of it is not very clever.

Personal full node gives you the real financial independence from trusted third parties.

@_date: 2016-07-10 12:56:03


The most useful way of doing that is through BIP32 wallets (
You can find the right use case on the BIP32 document.
Some tips: 
* you can enforce the safety by generating bunch of addresses offline and transfering them online in batches and using them as you already suggested (but with the benefit of the only seed for backup).
* Use hardened derivation where possible. You cannot derive addresses from an hardened Master Public Key but you can do it offline using the Master Secret.
* You can also get more sophisticated using HDM (Hyerarchical Deterministic Multisig wallets) and generate batches of addresses which need 2 out of three signature to be spent.

"What could appear to be future obstinance from miners on certain projects, could very well prove to be restrictions placed upon miners from state actors who forbid companies from signaling for certain anonymity upgrades. This surveillance will be done in the name of national security, and it’s not just China that you would have to worry about. Miners in the US would be at the same or greater risk of being threatened, if not shut down for allowing fully anonymous transactions. This censorship could happen anywhere."
@_date: 2017-06-25 11:05:09


As I see it the problems come with economic nodes running Core before miners.
As businesses they tend to embrace "revolutions" just when it's too late and they will stick with Core client till the very end. This means that customers of Coinbase, Bitstamp, Bitfinex, Kraken, Xapo (who already twitted about it), Poloniex and (you name it), will transact on a very dangerous chain passible of reorg.
The question is not weather these and the other services will update their software to BIP148 (or segwit2x) but WHEN.
By keeping their "neutral" or "status quo" position they are just raising concerns IMHO.
Everybody's waiting for other to decide but to do nothing is not the best choice AT ALL.
@_date: 2017-06-14 08:33:51
I'm afraid you have confused the chains. 
Bitmain will never mine the BIP148 chain and I don't think chinese miners will mine it either. 
He will start instead a new chain (UAHF) with larger blocks which he will hide and he will mine it for 72 hours.

True but as long as BIP148 clients are concerned all the valid blocks signals segwit.
@_date: 2017-06-27 19:16:03
I'm not sure of what you're trying to saying. Uasf clients will follow the longest chain of blocks signaling bit1 like segwit2x will do. As long as a chain signals BIP 148 and segwit2x will follow it.
Once segwit is locked in signaling is no more required.

I tend to believe that their "Intention to signal bit4 to then signal bit1" is to have some code from Core that "somehow" will satisfy the promise to have a 2 Mb HF in six months.
So it depends on weather some code will be accepted as "promising" or "ensuring". Please don't ask if this makes sense from a technical point of view.

The UASF chain will work. After not so long you will be able to evaluate the situation. If you want to go back to the legacy chain or to an other chain you will have to install the appropriate client which in that moment will be opportune.
If you want to go back to the legacy chain, please take into account that it may be subject to reorgs which will wipe out all its transactions (and rewards).
With a good support from miners and economic nodes, BIP148 is the safe one.

It is a very different type of risk though. Knowing that a small fraction of the money in circulation are actually in existence is much more scaring for me. I prefer the single teller risk and frankly I haven't heard of better solutions yet. If you don't want THAT kind of risk you can transact offchain through Coinbase or Circle.

Ddos typically affect your front side, if the backbone is intact (your trade engine and stuff) and you manage to find other ways to receive orders (he put in place proxies and a bot on IRC) you win in a way. and IMHO he won.
Also he uses pgp to sign and encrypt all the messages between the customers and the trading engine and this is for me a huge plus.

bitcoin is already a specific economy. No too much reasons to make the investment even more "heroic" and to put all the eggs in one basket.
It is much wiser IMHO to invest in bitcoin directly and to get rid of the risk relative to a specific company.
Invest in a particular bitcoin company only if you believe in that particular bitcoin company and in its competitive advantage but with a small fraction of what you decided to invest in bitcoin in general.
I can't see no reasons for taking so much "specific risk" unless you don't *love* the company and you don't strongly believe it will outperform the others but you should diversify anyway in a portfolio of at least ten companies of that kind.

Diffeeent level of security. Blockchain.info after 2013 hasn't earned a good reputation security wise: twice they were affected by a bug in the signing operation which uses the same value inside instead of being each time randomly generated. They were the last (or so) wallet to use a new address for each operation (bad security and privacy practice). One of the last wallets to be able to send to p2sh addresses. Their javascript interfaces is no so secure.
I think and I hope they are improving a lot in that regard and I feel a dick since I don't use them since 2013 but if you ask me I would use Electrum or Armory o Bitcoin Core. They have a better reputation.
Last advice: if you want security, go straight to hardware wallets: Ledger, Trezor, keepkey, whatever, their security model is order of magnitude ahead.

The price on Mt.gox is higher because is hard and expensive to withdraw USD from there. So if you want your money back you HAVE to buy and withdraw bitcoins. Just avoid it for the moment.
2. If you buy bitcoin On mt.gox you don't obtain any address. They simply register them under your account.

It depends to which extent probably,
@_date: 2013-04-30 19:06:15
IMHO there is not much wrong in using few addresses you know and can recognize and manage also in different clients.
Vanity addresses are born in this perspective.
Brain and paper wallet imply you have a certain control on the addresses you use.
I'm not so confident instead in managing software that produces addresses everytime you spend and split your money around.
At the end is a question of personal attitude. I prefer to know where my money go and are.
Also the change mechanism might give you a false sense of safety that I personally don't see in the substance.
By querying the blockchain you can always get the source of an expense (if it has not been done  through a mixing obviously) and see the balance of an address. To link the addresses of a wallet might be not so difficult.
If one day it will be possible to obtain the private key from an address the whole protocol will be compromised and to have wallets with many addresses will be a ridiculous defense.

if the majority of hashing power signals segwit, there will be a weird situation before Segwit is locked in:
* UASF and segwit2x nodes will refuse NON signaling blocks
* Core clients will accept them
So if exchanges and wallets don't take a stand (they will be the last doing it) and there are miners who don't signal SegWit, the "economic majority" would be paradoxically on an often wiped out chain.

It doesn't make a lot of difference if you keep all the addressees in the same place. If Had to spend some bitcoin I keep in one single fat address I would probably manage to spend it entirely signing offline two transaction one to an online wallet for the little expenses and one to a secure (generated offline) new address. So every time I have to use my only-addres-wallet I have to empty it and throw it away.
I wouldn't feel so nervous about it. It wouldn't just be so straight.

three options:
* BTC VAULT on a disconnected pc
* Brainwallet
* Paper wallet
These are safe if you do them properly regarding storage.
To spend them you have also to be careful:
* BTC Vault: create a deseeded copy of your offline wallet on an online pc and create an unsigned transaction to carbonwallet for the amount you can afford to loose (like 1BTC?)
* Paper wallet: create an other address than send 249 BTCs to the new paper address (created safely) and 1 BTC to carbonwallet
* brainwallet: create an other brain wallet and send 1 BTC to carbonwallet and 249 to your new brainwallet. choose your succeeding brainwallet in a way that from one is impossible to guess the succeeding.

I would like to remind many of you that every mined block assign the new generated coins to an address the miner gives among the addresses he has got the corresponding private key. Is pretty rare and stupid for a miner to give always the same address (at least one don't want to tell the world how rich he is).
A wallet is a GROUP of addresses normally (but not necessarily) wrapped into a file with the corresponding private keys so the concept of wallet hardly has a meaning in this discussion.

To avoid the risk you should use a twin installation of either Armory or Electrum:
* one on an online computer with "watch only" version of your wallet (whatever OS)
* the other installation of the same program with your complete wallet on a offline pc with a linux live distribution (btc vault apears good at it)
To make a transaction:
1. you do it on your online pc but you get an unsigned transaction. 
2. You copy the unsigned transaction on your offline pc with a usb key
3. You sign your transaction with your offline client
4. You copy back the signed transaction on your online pc 
5. You broadcast your transaction either with your client or with blockchain.info/pushtx
There is no way to access to your key from the internet so you have put a good wall against thefts.
@_date: 2013-04-16 06:10:33
Very nice post. We all have to ponder very well.
Don't be scary. As  for today keep on your online wallet the same amount you would take with you in cash going to the beach or similar spot.
On line wallets are too smart to be avoided but too risky to be trusted.
Keep the rest of your money in paper or brain wallets. Yes to build them you'd better to be disconnected but it's one shot.
Split your bitcoin in many addresses so when you refill your on line wallet you put at risk only the amount of that address.
Spending: bitpay is espanding and is prooving to be the right way. Hopefully others will follow and they will be only the step1. Obviously we hope to enter in a bitcoin only economy but for now...

Many childwood errors here in my opinion. After 1 confirmation a restaurant should take the risk and consider the payment gone through. Some confirmation could randomly get late and you can't as a merchant make the customer wait more than a quarter of an hour (and this is already a loong time).
On the blockchain app on the other side is not always clear the fee attached to the transaction and you could by mistake send a transaction with zero fees and that could cause problems and disappointments.
The confirmation speed is still a problem in normal transaction. It's necessary that we can trust on just one confirmation for these kind of transaction and no transaction at all for microtransactions. At least until we don't find alternative solutions for these lkind of use cases.

Mt.gox has normally an higher price because it is very long and difficult to have your money (usd) back so there a lot of people compelled to by bitcoins to have a way out. I don't know why btc-e is normally lower priced. I know there is some concern about security but  I do not think the lower  price is a matter of trust in this case. For sure it is very difficult to pass fiat money from a market to an other so there's not a big chance for arbitrage and is making the price differences higher.

First of all I assume your asking about their ewallet service. 
Yes, I use their wallet and I find them really ahead in many things: 
* escrow service
* multiple choices of two step authenication
* watch only addresses
* webcam reading of your paper wallet secret key
* synchronized phone app
* shared send
and maybe others that I don't remember.
Conversely they are an online wallet:
**Do not leave there more cash than you would leave on your gym closet.**
One day their service will be probably hacked and you'll better have stored the large amounts in paper or brain wallets.
Disclaimer: This is just my opinion.

Keep the same amount of money you would take with you to go out in an on line service: Blockchain.info is fantastic but also strongcoin, coinbase or whatever.
keep your real money in paper and "brain" wallet. 
Because Bitcoin-qt, Multibit, Electrum are really good in creating random private keys/addresses pairs but for this very reasons if you work in different computers (who doesn't) you surely will end in losing control on how many wallets and addresses you own and the backup issue will not be so easy.
I have personally quitted using local client and unless you are not a very accurate person I strongly suggest you to keep your addresses and private keys in a safe or in your mind as well.
@_date: 2013-03-31 22:38:55
yeah I agree and I've personally done it. But what if you don't trust the computer you are scanning on? If it's online maybe is not that safe.

An improove to Google authenticator. If you access a site FROM mobile it is very unconfortable to switch back and forth to look at the 6 digits code, learn it, repeat it while you switch application and come back to the browser and then digit it (probably wrongly).
Also the alternative of copynìing the code switch application and paste is very unconfortable.
There should be an app that if you log in to mt gox (or blockchain) the application detect the action and automatically copy the 6 digits code  into the clipboard so when the code field apear you just have to paste it. 
In alternative it would be important to have the codes in the notification area so they could be just there ready to be copied into the field when you need them.

You are right. To say it's simple we have to see the software and to make the complete transaction process but the device is, as you said, minimal and I consider it to be a plus.

In some european contry thanks to to SEPA legislation international transfer are really easy and you can do them online exactly like they were domestic transfer. SEPA so far seems really working.

Good answer. Even if I stick with my previous answer I have to admit that your explanation add a doubt to my argumentation. 
For sure the change mechanism add privacy in a way and you have explained very well how.
I don't think that rea hackers are in trouble to join addresses together to figure out a wallet but for sure to manage few addresses "manually" make their life easier.
you make me think.

The use of a rasberry pi is just my missing ring.
It was weeks that I tried to figure out what to use as an offline device.
I would have prefered a solid linux distribution on a usb stick. But it's very hard for me to build one with electrum or multibit.

maybe I' not so prudent but I would try [bitcoinbuilder]( at least for a part and I would buy like 1000 Usd every hour or so.
I would keep an eye on the price. It might be not a so big piece to digest but eventually I could stop.
I could feed initially Mtgox with 20000 just for a couple of days and then I would try.

Keep your everyday cash in an online wallet (blockchain.info,  coinbase) It's safe like to keep cash in your car but it is much simpler to mantain and to carry with you (two step autentication Is a must).
Keep your real money printed offline or keep them in your brain (brainwallet).
Only if you trust in your ability to mantain your hardware and your data and to defend them from hackers keep them on a client:  Multibit and Electrum. Bitcoin-qt is Too difficult.

It's essential.
it has got no display but it seems safe. The secret key never leaves the chip.
It should cost less than 20$.
The software should be ready by the end of next week.
The reviewed it also on [bitcointalk]( but now it's time to try it.
Those guys didn't even know Reddit. Show them some interest!

The tradeoff between safety and usability has not been solved yet. Blockchain app is a strong choice toward the latter. 
I would use it just charging small amounts before going out to make expenses.
The good choice for big amounts are not online wallets in general.
On the other hands if you go out on a dark evening with some thousand dollars in cash I wish you luck also for your personal safety not only for your money.

Here's the backup plan:
Everytime you set up a 2 factor authentication take note of the secret code. That is all you need to do.
The secret code is inside the qrcode the site gives you to set up google authenticator.
If you are not familiar with crypto tools like gpg or truecrypt just print it and store it in a safe before scanning it with your google authenticator app.

yeah. but I guess nobody else. There is evidently a fear of disclosure too much about the miners.
What I find strange is: a network that is funded on openness is so obscure about the dimension of his backbone...

Well I like keepass a lot but when you own an android and a mac and a linux and a windows you find extremely difficult to sync your password db across multiple installation mainly for the differences in the database versions.
Clipperz is simpler because without installing anything you have your password across any device.
Being online involves a lot of more trust though. 
It's just an other opensource choice and I'm glad it exists. 
Those guys deserve support.

Wherever you deposit your money. You have then to beg to move them somewhere else as if the money were not yours. Banks have a lot of rules and expenses and they use them not always for clear goals.
Bitcoin gives you an alternative to deposit and move your money as if they were yours. It's just something different that wasn't there before...

in my opinion the best thing is:
1. Open a wallet (blockchain, inputs.io, etc.)
2. print the qr code of one of the receiving addresses
3. Exhibit the paper with the qr code to the client for the payment.
4. Use the phone to verify the transaction on: 
For your safety I would keep a spare wallet with a small amount for safety if you are compelled to make a transaction against your volonty.
@_date: 2013-11-03 21:49:59
Why not. The amount you keep on blockchain is like the cash you carry in your pocket on a friday night for the beers. If you loose it f**k, but is not all you got.
