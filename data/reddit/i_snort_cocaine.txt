Have had funds on coinbase since 2013, havent had any issues, but honestly I would only keep what I need as a hotwallet so I can purchase things daily. transfer the majority onto a ledger or on paper.

These guys don't know real stress, if only they knew the real stress of having to download second life, purchase linden dollars and the searching for ATM in the middle of bum fuck island, where 2 fat lesbians from Wisconsin talk about how humid it is in TEXAS, just to trade Linden to Bitcoin, THATS some MOTHERFUCKING STRESS. there wasn't even time to think about HODLING all you had to think about was LOADING... secondlife on a 1.4GHZ intel with 4gb of minimal ram.

TL;DR Guy puts $250 to invest, waits only 2 months, price drops, weak hands sell $100 left of his $250 investment. Says he could've bought house if he didn't sell.
