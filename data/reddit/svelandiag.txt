@_date: 2018-11-23 06:46:57
ho it's ok then, I just need to be patient, and Im very patient I waited all this year to buy just today at this low price (imo) so I can wait for people to start cheering up again, Im just fresh energy as many other people, new money to the market is healthy to finish cycles like this bear market you all have suffered 
@_date: 2018-11-23 04:40:18
Yeah as I said I knew Bitcoin almost 1 year ago but I didn't have money on that time to buy bitcoin, but in this year I learned a lot about Bitcoin technology, financial education, financial system, etc...
@_date: 2018-11-23 18:04:04
could you explain to me what do you mean when you say "cost averaging"?
@_date: 2018-11-23 20:38:33
Yeah I Just wish all my clients use Bitcoin, and those who dont, I tell them to use it as advise 
@_date: 2018-11-23 06:37:42

@_date: 2018-11-23 17:43:19

@_date: 2018-11-23 04:35:28

@_date: 2018-11-23 04:32:49

@_date: 2018-11-23 18:01:50
Why? what could happen if I say I have 1 bitcoin? I mean this is virtual space and it's supposed to be anonymous anyone would know who I am in real world 
@_date: 2018-11-22 21:20:53
Thanks I really understand Bitcoin and I truly believe this will worth a lot in some years 
@_date: 2018-11-23 04:38:17
Thanks I will definitely look at it, and of course learn all I can
@_date: 2018-11-23 04:44:47
Yeah of course, although it dropped more today lol 
@_date: 2018-11-23 18:08:07
Thanks, I'll take the risk, anyone who understand bitcoin knows this will worth a lot in some years
@_date: 2018-11-29 20:15:50

@_date: 2018-11-23 07:46:21
not too much actually here there's a lot of money 
@_date: 2018-11-23 04:41:20
Yeah I'll buy some more if it goes to 2-3k range 
@_date: 2018-12-04 02:21:14
This is OTC movement, nothing to worry about, of course idiots will sell because of this, so if you're in a long position be careful with your stop loss 
@_date: 2018-12-05 22:50:35
I prefer this one [ it's simpler and easier, however I see you have more coins there so interesting to see how it progresses, is this freemium? or you will maintain this for free?
@_date: 2018-12-14 02:37:37
Well I think that one of the dissadvantages is that anyone with your public keys can see how many bitcoins you have in your wallet or can track where are you sending bitcoins and track how many you have, well after the lightning network solves the scalability issue I think the next issue we have to solve is the privacy, transactions are not that anonymous as you think 
@_date: 2018-12-11 21:52:51
look at the same old 2015 threads and askyourself the same question again 
@_date: 2018-12-11 19:44:18

@_date: 2018-12-05 22:46:59

@_date: 2018-12-14 02:31:06
