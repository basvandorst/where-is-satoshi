seems reasonable

if you're gonna buy more right now, do your best not to sell for a loss when it eventually falls. that's the worst thing ya could do my man. either sell soon, or wait til next time around in a year or two

ye u got it

with how fast it's growing it's gonna fall like it did when it hit 20k.  
as soon as you see celebrities saying they're buying, get ready for the drop, if you wanna make a quick buck, pull out whenever you feel comfortable. but don't get too greedy if that's the move you wanna make.  
will it drop and then spike again in the future? maybe. That's what hodling is for. say we peak at 40k, and then drop, assuming it'll follow the same process, that means it'll hit around 60k in a few years. it's all speculation.   
personally, I think a lot of people are going to sell once it gets very high, and the drop to low numbers will be very very scary. many hodlers have been waiting for a moment like this, even if they say to the moon. if you've got shaky hands about it, take the profit now and don't sell out of fear when it plummets. that's my opinion.

Basically, you could potentially buy and get a little profit buy selling like an hour or two later, but it's too high of a risk that it would drop the moment you buy it over the reward of gaining a few dozen bucks (depends on how much you get but, I hope you get the point)

It'd probably be too late by then, also, if you've sold for a loss before, you should be more cautious about assessing risk for yourself  
What mistake did you make before?  
What will you change to not let it happen again?  
There's no guarantee for any particular day, but usually these type of events don't last for very long. It may be in your best interest to wait it out.   
There's much risk involved in buying because something is succeeding rapidly, I think it may be more wise to invest in something that you see being good in the foreseeable future.   
Essentially follow the rule: "Buy low, sell high" if you wish to sell it. Right now, it is certainly not low, aye?

Oh, it's that simple? I was thinking of buying a trezor but I guess if I already have these I'm pretty good and set

Ooh, an OpenDime. I bought a pack of three thinking they were hardware wallets, they didn't let me return them. What'd be the best use for them?

Okay, I'll check those out, thanks! 
I originally was looking at Bitcoin Core since I started a few months ago, but it's complexity was confusing. I guess in the end it should be worth the effort it takes to learn.

Personally I've gotten into a habit of that to avoid various forced emojis. (:

I'm simply asking my best move, I didn't ask for discrimination

Oh yeah haha, I actually was confused concerning the "8 years behind" thing.. I read a little bit and understand it now. At the time I first started trading I had archaically slow internet so I didn't have the patience to wait for it to update.

I live in Arizona, alas, I cannot relate. ):
I hope it becomes available to me soon

In the back of my head, the idea of leaving this country slowly grows..
