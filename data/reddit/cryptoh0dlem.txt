It is enforceable if the people rise up and demand that their government complies. Either they comply, or they end up showing that they are not truly "For the people". The problem is motivating enough people away from their "bread and circus" Netfix.

thank you, and noted, good sir! just thought that "super long, boring, and banal" would be much more effective in this particular situation!

Thanks LOL and unfortunately, I wasn't high haha
1. I'm no expert, but dumping that much on a major exchange for less than market value would have a huge effect IMO. The Mt. Gox lawyer sold a tiny fraction of Satoshi's holdings, and his selloff is widely attributed as the main trigger of this year's bear market (debatable, though)... and he sold at market value!!! Granted, in my hypothetical future scenario, there would be much higher volume because of mass adoption (or getting close to it).
2. You've wisely chosen the red pill... Enjoy your trip down the rabbit hole. Watch these videos, in order, and call me in the morning:
@_date: 2018-11-12 23:32:26
but would a softfork be embraced if the community didn't have guns to their heads and everybody believes that Satoshi has only good intentions?
@_date: 2018-11-12 23:24:30
EDIT: Sorry, I misread your comment originally.
Yeah I kinda left that up to your imagination... but essentially, dumping 1.5m BTC at far below market value would probably have a huge effect on its price, make many people scramble for "last resort" gold and silver, plunge the world into a bear market and chaos that would change the political landscape drastically, at a time when we would already be on the brink of WW3.
Others have commented that they don't think that would happen, but we really don't have any precedence or proof one way or another besides the Mt. Gox selloff, when they sold a tiny fraction of 1.5m BTC off at market value, and it is widely (although debatably) seen as the trigger for the 2018 bear market.

No way for anybody to tell if Satoshi would be bluffing or not... If the world leaders stop whatever wars and comply with Satoshi then nobody will lose their money... Why would people all over the world choose to rewrite the code and keep warring versus removing their leaders if necessary? Or just revolting and making their leaders comply with Satoshi's demands?
Essentially, if it comes down to this, it will come down to four possible scenarios:
1. Our leaders comply with Satoshi's demands to come to a peaceful resolution. (might possibly be the most desirable outcome, depending on what country you live in)
2. Revolt and/or replace our leaders unwilling to comply with Satoshi. (also might possibly be the best outcome, depending on what country you live in)
3. Ignore Satoshi, keep warring and killing each other, call his potential "bluff" which might or might not end in everybody (including our leaders) losing their bitcoin investment, and risk a complete global meltdown enough to destabilize the governments of every country which (if it comes to that) would allow them to be replaced by hopefully less corrupt ones that embrace a bitcoin standard (or gold, or some proven crypto unable to be debased) but only after much global chaos and uncertainty. (not really a smart thing to do for our leaders... the destabilization would probably redistributing wealth away from the politicians/leaders/wealthy and cause a very new, unfamiliar political landscape that they might not survive in, so they will be wary of this option)
4. Softfork and keep killing each other. (least favorable outcome, IMO)
Think we'll vote on a blockchain? Or a post-blockchain like Holochain?
Edit: added proper PBG terms and the other 2 options which I originally lumped into 2.
@_date: 2018-11-16 05:24:39
Case in point, the Bcrash just proved it... and it was a helluva lot less BTC than Satoshi owns...
@_date: 2018-11-13 02:27:40
Wouldn't this essentially not be a simple public goods game though, but rather a "PBG with punishment and/or reward" which means that "The combination seems to yield both a higher level of cooperation and of payoffs."
@_date: 2018-11-13 08:35:36
The figure I've seen is \~1.5m, but you're right, we have no idea about the true number... but keep in mind that the BTC crash/reversal on the first week of May 2018 was caused by the Mt. Gox lawyer market-selling only 8000 BTC, which was (and still is) a fraction of a percent of the BTC in circulation, because BTC's price is only determined by the BTC held on the exchanges and being traded.
That's why OTC trading does not affect its price. That \~6% today (of all BTC in circulation) might not have as much effect today because a higher percentage of people are keeping their BTC on exchanges today than they will be after mass adoption occurs. The average future BTC user Joe and Jane will not be trading BTC on exchanges, like the average BTC owner today who is a trader/investor. So if:
half of all BTC is held on exchanges, it goes up to a \~10% dump.
1/4 of all BTC is held on exchanges, it goes up to a \~20% dump.
1/5 of all BTC is held on exchanges, it goes up to a \~25% dump.
1/10 of all BTC is held on exchanges, it goes up to a 50% dump.
What's going to be the figure at the moment of truth?
What figure  is "enough" to have the desired effect?
Will the leaders trying to start WW3 be willing to risk it?
Will the public be okay with their leaders calling Satoshi's "bluff" and them losing much of their savings?
@_date: 2018-11-13 03:01:52
There was another possibility, which I neglected to include... Essentially the Satoshi could possibly not announce anything, and just dump their btc at the last possible second without any warning. I really don't think that the Satoshi would choose this route though, because it has too much of a potential for a negative outcome. The uncertainty of why it happened would almost certainly cause enough chaos to not have a favorable outcome, and the world's faith in crypto assets would be severely undermined, potentially setting us back a few hundred years in many aspects. Still a possibility, though...

How did you know???? I thought that for sure, everybody would think that even my fake surprise reply to your comment would be taken as a joke. Wait a second, nobody's read my "fake surprise reply" yet... I might've jumped the gun on that one.
In all seriousness though, I just haven't really seen this echoed anywhere yet, so I wanted to make sure it gets out there and people can prepare for it, and they'll be assured that I only have the world's best interests in mind.

lol HODLEMs that would be funny!
really until infinity? that's awesome, so that would be using sidechains like theLanthia said?

thx :)
@_date: 2018-11-12 23:33:59
I thought of that, too! Maybe the Satoshi plan to do that after the world's leaders comply, or if the backdoor is no longer needed and the "Bitcoiniminati" disband themselves?
@_date: 2018-11-13 00:01:26
don't confuse BS with conjecture lol I don't propose to have any proof

"It would be embraced if it's evident that Satoshi's million is being used to destabilize the market."
But what if that destabilization was the only way to prevent World War 3?

haha good idea, doubt it would sell though lol i'm not even an amateur writer

Gotcha! Nobody knows what the future holds, but I'd be surprised if we make it even one decade before the Satoshis have to play their card...

Point taken and conceded, so would I. If the mass of the world's wealth is transferred to bitcoin/crypto in the next 5-10 years during a global financial crisis and the world is on the brink of World War 3, do you see yourself (and more importantly, the public masses and the world leaders) being as confident in the outcome? Given an entirely new, unproven scenario with no historical precedence to learn from? Not that any world leaders or people ever study history in order to make important decisions...
Let's put this into perspective: Satoshi might own \~5% of all bitcoin (once they've all been mined). There are other whales... and in (let's say) 8 years, depending on when you transferred your wealth into bitcoin, it would have already caused a massive shift of wealth, probably away from many previously wealthy and powerful people, which would already have caused a changing landscape of power, chaos, and probably war (the only way Satoshi would play his hand, remember?).
What would have happened if a country had suddenly dumped 5% of the world's reserves of gold at a time when the world still followed a gold standard? What would happen if a country today suddenly returned all their USD to the US Treasure and demanded it be exchanged for gold? It's simple economics, even if it would be temporary. Most of the world at that point will not have the level of knowledge about crypto that you do. The general population will only potentially be that knowledgeable in many decades, at least until the people 40 and over today die off.
Do you remember how much the Mt. Gox lawyer dumped?
Sure, it would be temporary... but the public's loss of faith (even temporary) would be enough to cause chaos and a potential multi-year bear market, and make the public look very unfavorably at those politicians whom decided to call Satoshi's bluff. Don't forget, crypto will still be "new" to most people in 8 years... and it takes time for people to become confident in new technology.
You and I might buy the dip... but can you be so sure that you won't be catching a falling axe, as people scramble for gold? If you don't have any other commitments, you might be able to ride it out for a few years... but what if you have a business? What if you would potentially lose your house? Your kids couldn't finish college? These are the questions the masses will be asking themselves... Remember, my second stipulation was that most of the world's wealth had been converted into bitcoin/crypto... and if you think you could shelter in XMR or something else, don't forget that there's a really big possibility that bitcoin will stay the "USD" of crypto... When USD crashes, it takes everything else out along with it. Same thing with BTC...

haha thx! that would be hilarious...

Interesting... I read an article not too long ago which calculated that quantum computers would not be able to approach the necessary computational power in any reasonable amount of time, even if there were massive leaps in advancement many orders of magnitude higher than anything currently even on the horizon. Is that not the case any more? Have there been some drastic advancement since I read that article? I think it's only been about 6 months to a year since I read it...
@_date: 2018-11-13 03:11:25
Can you please quote the parts that you didn't think were feasible ideas?
Also, please quote the part that you were referring to in this sentence: "If reality gives you results you don’t understand or agree with, then you are the problem." and clarify which results I did not understand or agree with.
@_date: 2018-11-12 23:25:42
I'll take that as a compliment! :)
@_date: 2018-11-13 05:29:49
I totally agree with you on all points, but how much time would it take for bitcoin to recover?
"all bets are off" Exactly! 
How can you be so sure that the destabilization caused by a selloff like that wouldn't cause so much chaos in your country/region that it wouldn't cause you significant problems?
How much time are you willing to HODL and lose money (rather than temporarily shifting some of your money to gold) if you have mouths to feed and in the face of a potential crash?
How can you be sure that it wouldn't take 3 years to recover, and in those three years, if you didn't diversify into gold, then you would potentially lose your house, your business? Have to pull your kids out of college?
@_date: 2019-01-15 07:51:40
I've never understood the argument against HODLing either... Is the value of gold suppressed by the 4500 tons that Ft. Knox is HODLing? By that logic, selling it all on the open market would make gold's price skyrocket, but that doesn't make sense...
It always seemed to me as if that argument originated from manipulators, and was propogated by FUD... 
@_date: 2018-11-08 17:56:25
Interesting... didn't know that, thanks!
@_date: 2018-11-16 05:29:03
This Bcrash was caused by a selloff of 0.0001% of the amount of Satoshi's holdings... sure, BTC will recover and survive, but even this sent shockwaves... don't you think that a 1.5m BTC dump could cause an extended bearmarket that might even drive people far into alts if it happens after mass adoption?
@_date: 2018-12-24 10:33:25
So after a month of low liquidity affecting the markets, does anybody think differently? Even 10-15k USDT market sells cause crashes lately. Nobody thinks that a 1.2m BTC market sell would cause even a blip?
