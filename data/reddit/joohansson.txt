In the Nano case, no. Private keys is secured in the hardware and can not even be exported. That's the whole point of a hardware wallet. You can only recover with the 24 word mnemonic (which contains extended public and private keys).

That was really evil! It points out the thing I like most with Nano S; the display. Your generated seed does never touch your computer or internet, not even during recovery. It goes straight from display to paper, you just need to check that no cams are pointing at you. Really secure little thing (if you understand how it works, victim did not).

Tech question: Lets say there will be 100 stable LN nodes spread over the world in the near future when everything is up and running. And those will have open channels to at least one of the others. Would it be enough for users to have just one channel to any one of those nodes in order to transact to anyone else also having just one channel open to one of those? If that's the case, LN would really be as easy to use as any mobile bitcoin wallet. A proper app should be able to do all configs for the user who just add bitcoins and pay. No need to know what's going on under the hood with channels and stuff. If that happen, bitcoin will be ready for mainstream!

It's called network effect. Facebook, Twitter, Instagram grew very similar. The difference is Bitcoin can handle pure value and not only information and images of kittens. It doesn't matter if the user base is exploding right now. It's the technology behind that matters and it will not go away. It's been around for 8 years now (1/3 of WWW public usage), that is not a definition of media hype.

Use a wallet that allow you to set your own fee. A lower fee will take longer, depends on what you need.  Also very high right now because the biggest events of the year currently in action with lots of new users. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:18:26
Same here. No problem with ledger and Bitcoin payment. Never buy anything from an exchange. Use a wallet like coinbase or whatever.

Got in at $650 2013 and wanted to get some quick buck during the hype. Then it crashed for one year but at that time I undetstood the potential and value of bitcoin and instead of selling I bought 10x more at $250 in 2015, the lowest point since 2013. I was absolutely convinced it would return to the $1000 level. It was (by far!) and I'm still holding 100% minus the amount I invested. Might sell part of it soon, like 10-20% to use in some other investments. I'm a long term person and saving for my children in case the world goes to shit coming 50 years.

Exactly, haven't looked at it yet but I know what it means to go mainstream. A payment card owner just know how to enter their PIN-code, nothing about the unerlying technology. That's the maximum level of understanding you should require by an app user. Create a wallet (channel), load it with money, scan product and verify payment.

@_date: 2017-12-27 16:50:49
Yes exactly, what does "not locked" mean? They are locked until you spend them in LN or cancel the channel, right? Just like your USD is locked in bitcoins until you spend them. I'm a programmer, either it's locked or not locked, can't be half locked. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 16:04:29
Can't a good app do that automatically? Maybe you just have to set a fee limit per time unit. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 14:44:13
But my realistic long term goal is 10%. I think I got lucky first years. I will sell and put some of my bitcoins in there to diversify beginning 2018.

Can't the channels automatically close and renew when the balance runs out? That way you don't need to lock a large amount? They can't be used for large single tx though. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 16:43:41

Well not only Bitcoin, the whole industry is more ready and also the world itself. Some comparison. 
One big exchange, MtGox, which collapsed and brought the whole system down with it. Now there are hundereds. Cannot happen again. Also the wall street boys are joining with futures, etfs and etcs. Was impossible 2013.
A few altcoins back then. Now there are over 1500 with at least 20 that are really promising and proves what kind of stuff you can achieve with crypto and blockchains. Most live on the backbone of Bitcoin because that is the entry point and most trusted and oldest system. They need bitcoin wherever you like it or not. 
2013 it was drug money. Now it's accepted in most countries with regulations, ATMs, trusted companies etc.
Insanely more businesses accepting bitcoin today. Going very strong in Japan for exemple. Why use bitcoin if it cannot be used? Not true anymore. Things are developing fast now.
Big companies and Banks are developing blockchain solutions. That is very positive for Bitcoin because that is the underlying tech. People will trust it. 
Second layer solutions are soon here, lightning network for exemple. That will be a game changer. Was impossible 2013 because it was invented 2015. 
More open source developers and businesses are working world wide to solve the biggest questions. It's not even comparible to 2013. 
I could go on and on and on but it's getting silly. If you can't see this than you must have been under a big rock for the past years.

Every person cashing out is an improvement for those who stay. It decreases the chance of everyone cashing out at the same time (price crash) but also help price climb in the long run. If more people enter the market at higher levels over time the "low bar" will increase. It means lower risk for a crash to levels below that bar. If 100% of users bought at price $10k and up then no one would "cash out" below that and very low risk of crashing. $10k would be the new zero. Good luck with your house, it's a good investment.

It's a very interesting side effect of crypto and the inner works is pretty much unprecedented in the history of money as far as my knowledge goes. Most economic models do not apply to Bitcoin. Banks are trying to predict the market but they fail over and over again.  It was one of the reasons I invested in 2013 because many of the 2010-2011 holders had already cashed out. How often do you read about someone in here that has been holding since 2010? There is none, very few or they don't visit here or talk about it. Many sold during the 2013 race. I'm convinced, like many others, we are only scraching the surface of what cryptocurrencies has in mind for the future. We are witnessing a new era and the birth of Internet Money. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 15:41:00
It's going up and down, so what? I never said it's going straight up forever. I'm looking long term 10+ years. Calling it a bubble is useless. If you don't say crypto going to die then it's just another term for volatility, which will decrease over time.

The heavy price movement arrows up and down are much shorter predictions, just one month while some other are 6 months. Does that make it more probable that price stays relatively the same?

A real company is a bit different since it's their decision and responsibility. Bitcoin can fork anytime by anyone infinite times. You can't expect/force every exchange to update their code. Coinbase is not the only one not supporting BCH, I would say the majority does not support it. We don't even know yet if it's going to survive. You're right they can't expect all customers to just keep up on the news but hard to do more than sending out several emails like they did.

I believe more in Bitcoin than I have believed in anything in my entire life, otherwise I would have sold long time ago. Been holding since 2013 and that takes some gut, trust me. But I would not buy right now if I were a newcomer because there are some turbulence ahead with Segwit 1x, 2x, forking etc. Price could easily go down by half in short period of time, or nothing happens and it go up. Better when everything has settled and there are no big road blocks on the horizon. I think 2018 will be a great year!

Exactly. We have a very large paper in Sweden called "Dagens Industri". It's boring as hell, only finacial stuff like stocks and funds. They occationally write about Bitcoin, last time yesterday very positive about "Bitcoin is on the rise" and that everyone "selling their Bitcoin cash" :) The last part might not be very accurate but I don't care. They are positive about Bitcoin, that was very different a few years ago.

I wonder how much it will drop when everyone start depositing? I've sold 30% of my BCH yesterday as a precaution, would have been 4 times more today, but who cares, free BTC =) I guess the price will be in the range 0.01-0.05 soon.

I made several other widgets as well which I switch between using the wheel on the right side of the box.

I mean the time between spikes, that is exactly the block time which is exactly the same as current hash rate. You see an enormous difference at the time the difficulty changed (from 40 blocks/h to 4).

It could be in 24h if they stop mining and trigger EDA. BTC has no EDA mechanism, only BCH which will create some strange oscillations.

The value changes when the price go up and down. You can withdraw "on top" of your original deposit if you make profit (even if you have less than 20 confirmation on BCC).

I know there was a large delay on withdrawals on Jul 31, that is bad agree. I got an email from them Jul 19 warning about the hard fork and that they recommend withdrawal. Then a new warning 28th warning again that you need to withdraw "before 11.59 pm PT July 31, 2017". Then I saw on their twitter about delays. Sorry to hear you didn't get those emails.

Don't have any. I mined litecoins a few years back, not any more.
@_date: 2017-08-03 10:37:57
That is crazy! They saying "both balances WILL be decreased from the single transaction", not "maybe". I followed their previous statement and sent all my BCH from MAIN wallet. I still have all my BTC and have now moved all BTC to new address just in case. I really don't understand this, there should be replay protection in place. This is a HUGE mistake from Ledger. Goddamn if I were to lose all my BTC, I would kill myself..

Good point. The dump of mined BCH will be insane and push the price down even lower, right? Someone must buy all coins to cover mining cost. Also, what happens when all coins have been mined and the blocks are 1GB each which leads to zero transaction fees? That is BCH roadmap, right? Who will pay for the mining AND storage costs?
@_date: 2017-08-10 16:17:06
Sweden here. I remember when the dollar was really high, almost at same level as Euro. Bitcoin is mostly bound to USD which mean you got more Euro when selling BTC than usual. My feeling was that BTC/USD was almost unaffected i.e. Bitcoin increased in value compared to other currencies. Dollar strong = bitcoin strong. If you want to cash out your bitcoins you better wait until dollar move up again compared to NOK.

I have a BTC withdrawal stuck for 6h now. It has the status "verified" and my BCH deposit has over 30 confirmations of required 20. Either they have a HUGE backlog or they have disabled withdrawal without any notice. My previous withdrawal was fine, I also could withdraw ETH after my BTC withdrawal was frozen. This really worries me! Anyone else having problem?
Edit: Transaction went through after 7h. Made me a bit worried!
@_date: 2017-08-11 17:57:54
Ah I understand what you mean now. I didn't mean 2000% growth, I meant 2000% of original value. If something is 200% of original value that means increase by factor 2. 10% = x0.1, 1000% = x10.

Because 10% increase of your Bitcoin investment today is much more than 10% last year. % of %. In Sweden we call compound interest "The interest on interest effect". I found this very much related to how Bitcoin behave. The growth is guaranteed along with adoption until Bitcoin is replaced with something better.

When Kraken and everyone else open up for deposit, expect a huge price drop. If not, then I will be very surprised! Only current exchanges allow BCH dump are HitBTC and ViaBTC and they are quite small plus most people won't touch them. There is a 50% price difference between hitbtc and viabtc because hit only need 2 confirmations and via need 20. Standard market behaviour.

I've been a "behind the curtain" observer of this debate since the beginning and never wrote a single comment. From all the input I collected this is my conclusion:
Segwit is intelligent, complicated and long-term. It's for the Bitcoin as a network's best interest in order to survive from competition.
BU is simple, greedy and short-term. Miners want to own and control Bitcoin for a simple reason; high profit. They don't seem to understand that BU will most likely put Bitcoin to the grave.

Psychopathy, sometimes considered synonymous with sociopathy, is traditionally defined as a personality disorder characterized by persistent antisocial behavior, impaired empathy and remorse, and bold, disinhibited, egotistical traits.
* Boldness. Low fear including stress-tolerance, toleration of unfamiliarity and danger, and high self-confidence and social assertiveness.
* Disinhibition. Poor impulse control including problems with planning and foresight, lacking affect and urge control, demand for immediate gratification, and poor behavioral restraints.
* Meanness. Lacking empathy and close attachments with others, defiance of authority.

1. It's not crap. It's high end gear giving real pleasure for a music entusiast.
2. It will not age in a few years like a car or pc
3. I didn't gave btc away. It was a fair trade like people have traded for thousands of years
4. I've hold btc since 2013 and this was my first buy. It was not very expensive and compared to my holdings it was like a day trade. Not like I sold all my btc..
5. No guarantee btc will be "worth many times its current value". Are you a wizard?

Bitcoin is more attractive by "non super tech people" now than 2013. I think many people who invest today have no clue what bitcoin is, its goal or what is happening. They think of it as a get rich quick thing, then google and come here in panic when it drops. If you need personal advise when to buy and sell, you should not invest in the first place. Invest in what you believe in, do your research and weight the risk factors against possible gain. Finally, do not invest more than you can afford to lose! Shit happens..
@_date: 2017-11-03 08:21:09
Sure, debt free is nice but you have to consider your strategy. I have both student loan and house loan but also have a large portion in crypto, stocks and funds. If the world does not go entirely tits up my investment will grow faster than what i pay in interest and I can eventually pay back my loans without selling my house (plus securing my retirement), but paying back part of the loan right now with invested money is just not a good strategy from my point of view. Maybe if the interest is going up x10.

You are very correct about hardware wallet. I have bought several just in case and always test the recovery process before I send anything to them first time. I once did a firmware update and did not realize until after that all holdings would be fucked if my phrase was incorrect. It was correct thank god. Always store wallet and phrase as physically apart as possible should one of them be destroyed/stolen. Better keep them hidden inside a wall or something instead of a safe. Which one do you think thieves will take? Ledger nano s is also excellent because the phrase is never exposed on the computer. That is the most critical part considered all malware floating around. You can impossible know if your pc is compromised. It's crazy you had that amount in an exchange, I'm very happy to hear you got them out! I lost 1 btc in mtgox 2014, I guess I learned a lesson the hard way..

There is a way to never really panic and that is doing what I've done: I've sold btc to cover my initial investment and kept the rest. I'm still at 3000% ROI but can NEVER go minus only 0.1% ROI, thus I don't need to panic. For me it's all an experiment. I can go on with my life with or without Bitcoin. To be a true holder, you can't be too emotional or you'll never survive the dips mentally.

Unconfirmed tx has nothing to do with the time needed to find a block. It does push up the fee though for systems that automatically calculate the fee based on current tx in mempool. The picture you referring to is the other way around. When blocks are found less frequent (due to lower hash rate), number of unconfirmed tx will increase (if the speed of new tx is same).

I'm not from US but Europe and I recently had a meeting with my bank to clarify this. Since I will sell a significant amount coming years I put all cards on the table and provided proof of origin. Spent 4 days tracking and documenting everything since I never cared before. It was quite a job but now it's done! They have now approved that I can sell as much as I want through any exchange as long as it's not from a "bad country" and I tell in advance approx how much during the year. I felt it was better to do this before they start asking questions because banks can be very strict these days when it comes to money laundering.

Nothing is impossible with bitcoin but that doesn't matter if your horizon is at least several years ahead.

Sure, there are over 1000 altcoins but how many are accepted by merchants all over the world? They all decrease in price right now by the way because everything is tied to Bitcoin, even Ethereum.

In the first film, he intends to hold the world ransom for one million dollars, but doesn't understand that isn't as large a sum of money as it was in the 1960s, because of inflation, and the demand causes the U.N. to burst out laughing. In the second film, Dr. Evil goes back to 1969 and plans to hold the world ransom for $100 billion, and when he tells the amount to the President, he receives a similar reaction as in the first film when the President and his cabinet laugh at him (due to him demanding an amount of money that did not exist at that time).

Ledger Nano (or Trezor but it's ugly as hell). Store passfrase and device at different physical locations. If your device burns up, restore coins by pass. If your pass burns up, send your coins to another wallet and reset your device for a new pass. This is extremely safe way of storing bitcoins. You can also access part of your coins (or store more) at any time without compromising security like you do with a papper wallet as soon as you use it. You also have automatic fee calculation, support of upcoming forks, unique address for every transaction etc.

I don't say you're wrong with your sentence but you imply bitcoin has no value until you sell it. I don't agree. Everything in this world has some kind of value regardless wherever you sell it for money (whatever that is) or not. Maybe I have bitcoins just because I like them and I like them more at $6000 than $5000 dollar, then it does matter. Just as I like gold because it's shiny and I know other value it at a certain amount as well.

If it continue to rise forever, then everyone investing will eventually be able to sell at much higher price as new people are born and new investors replace old ones. I don't think that will happen but in theory it's possible (I think). Fiat reduction in value (inflation) has no lower limit, wouldn't it be the opposite with deflation?

And 99% of all alts are down. Pretty clear what they are exchanged into right now. 
@_date: 2017-10-29 20:08:53
Now 6.1k in 5....4....3....

No, another user actually wrote what I had in mind and joked about it but comment was gone before I could see it. I just saw the notification. I guess he actually got banned! I was banned once too but manage to get un-banned..
@_date: 2018-07-24 14:00:24
I compared against btc 6h ago (not usd) and 98-99% was red

Why does she cost $5000? Is she made of gold?

There is another coin (or two) that would fit in that picture today but apparently you get banned here if you mention it.. Very strange comparison indeed..

The nobs could be used to set high and low limit alert. If the watch face is digital then the numbers could be dynamic as well. Maybe a graph and current price in numbers in the middle. Maybe two arms pointing at outer/inner numbers. I hope to see this watch some day (or app in a smart watch). Feel free to grab this idea, I don't have "time". 
@_date: 2017-10-16 17:40:27
Of course. I just like to look back at "the big bubble" from 2013 as a small road bump. It was very big back then..
@_date: 2018-02-06 06:38:42
That is sooo good!
@_date: 2017-10-17 03:13:32
This post doesn't say anything about soon but statisticly it's impossible to avoid forever. But you will never know when, how low or for how long it will last so you better hold as long as you trust Bitcoin and don't need to buy shit. I've been through countless of crashes and "death clarifications" without selling. 
@_date: 2018-07-30 18:38:31
No and I would advise you to stop guessing and get banned. Send me a PM if you really want to know. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 03:53:12
Actually over $1000 in 24h period! On Kraken from $4820 to $5854.
@_date: 2017-10-08 05:58:27
That is an old picture, seen it before..
@_date: 2017-10-20 05:31:34
Yes :)
@_date: 2017-10-14 03:02:51
Ok thx, didn't check that
@_date: 2018-07-25 14:41:03
$0.0082/Day :)

You can send Bitcoin with a paper wallet using standard mail, no Internet required and the fee is quite low :) It will take a few days though!
@_date: 2018-07-21 20:59:52
And it's bigger than 80% of US ETFs:

Current market price * number of bitcoins ever mined so far. Maybe sounds like a big number but you can't use it for much other than comparison. It doesn't include any trade volume. Extreme case: You buy a btc from me for $1M and number of btc is 10 million. All other trades are halted world wide. Now the market cap is 10 trillion dollars regardless of what other has spent on the system past 10 years. Then you sell for $1 and market cap is now $10M. Doesn't matter if people spent $1 or $1B on the system, the market cap is just the current state. 
@_date: 2018-07-24 14:32:34
Yeah but then it will be opposite of THAT conclusion :)
@_date: 2017-10-16 18:48:02
I'm not predicting the future, just looking at history with amusement.

"No dictionary" was the comment. Do you think it's possible to edit and re-publish and get it approved?
@_date: 2018-04-02 18:11:33
Exactly, I trust Bitcoin but I would never lock any funds for more than 1 year.. In 14 years we will have VERY advanced AI:s for example.
@_date: 2018-04-15 06:20:26
And hope someone has not yet discovered a new way to hack the device.. 
@_date: 2018-07-24 19:21:54
Not true. I saw most alts was 5-10% lower than btc. Quite unusual

The forex bank in Sweden wanted a fix $10 (SEK equivalent) fee to transfer my exchanged EUR-SEK to my local bank account in SAME country. As I only exchanged about $20 I felt that was a bit hefty, took cash instead.. I wonder how they would'd reacted if I tried to transfer $10 with $10 fee..

Also, Segwit open up for lighning network.
@_date: 2017-05-20 04:32:18
That is actually quite interesting. I remember the day I bought my first Bitcoin just because I wanted to own at least one. It's not unrealistic they might think that one day too..
@_date: 2017-07-24 10:19:26
Ok perfect, thanks
@_date: 2017-05-26 14:08:33
Heard about bitcoin in 2010, started to notice when it was at $500 and bought my first at 700, then bought more at different occations all the way up to 1000 and all the way down to 200 with and average of 300. Still hold everything which is now worth a year salary. Will hold much longer, even if it crashes to 700. As long as there are no better alternative this is the shit that will change the world.

That period began before they activated bip91. Impossible to reach needed percentage.
@_date: 2017-07-24 10:21:24
I learned you control the private key at blockchain.info, so yes you don't need to move them. Only if you want to sell them
@_date: 2017-07-30 19:29:25
Finally, the most unserious exchange ever. I won't miss them.
@_date: 2017-07-27 05:14:11
I wonder if the 630000 btc missing will be split into bitcoin cash on aug 1. I want my btc back, plus bcc!
@_date: 2018-12-21 04:34:00
I gave the statement $2000 margin from current price

Do you think the price is set by people who care about $7? Almost all trades are done inside exchanges where transaction fees are not even considered. The big whales sending million dollar worth each transaction don't bother either. Just because you can't buy coffee with bitcoins doesnt mean it's doomed. 
@_date: 2017-06-12 05:26:08
Why does everyone assume OP is a "he"? Is Bitcoin for boys only :)
@_date: 2017-06-05 20:13:42
I lost my full btc stash in mtgox. Yes agree, do not store them in an exchange! Only if you need to trade.
