Ah bud. All I want is the tech discussions!

I understand the err in my question. I guess a speed up for onchain confirmations was my question?

okay what if the sell price is different. so let's say it's 14,000 in the US and 16,000 in India. The prices is determined by the exchanges so this is kind of happening.

XThis is beautiful mate. Bless your soul.

so it would take, at the least, 10mins for one transaction? Isn't this really slow? (Compared to going to someone and handing them fiat)

I definitely mean node. There is a gpu in the machine, but I take it it won't be used at all.

Could you elaborate on what make it headless? And how that is relevant?

Thanks. I'm in the process of becoming a citizen here. I'll have to find a way to pay taxes here but I will still find a way to sell in India.

Thanks for pointing this out. I actually know very little on the economic aspect of this but I am an academic with experience in computer architecture. I can assure you the 18 month out dated-ness(Moore's law) will not be dependable. could you possibly give me another reason assuming asic tech getting better is not a factor. Sure, there could be a completely different architecture but I am asking for a different factor.

Read up on it! Don't trust me or him blindly haha. Andreas Antonopolous has a book called mastering bitcoin. It's kinda techy but you can learn how to write your own bitcoin clone. In the process understand that you yourself could restart crypto if bitcoin gets shut down. The one truly amazing thing that block chain and crypto have given us is decentralized trust.

oh so you mean not even under traditional computing? haha that makes sense. Quantum is just a different world to me and I didn't know 1nm transistors worked in a commercial setting, just as a research project I could see. So this is off topic, but as a computer scientist , do you ever worry about your knowledge of computing being replaced by having the need to relearn a new way of thinking. I hope you understand what I'm trying to say. I'm sure no matter what happens, you're exposure to algorithmic thinking will make shifting your frame of thinking easy if needs be.
