It's gone man. You can be a creditor when they file.

No, because all the money would either be gone, or has to go to food.

Yeah, it's called the US Dollar, you can get it by working or being born to the right parents (the better choice). The banks are pretty secure. There even these things called credit cards that let you spend dollars you don't have!

It's program trading. Computer can cancel real fast.

If they invent BitCoin2 that can only be mined by GPU, I might participate this time :)
Who cares about BitCoin beta!

Now that is real life BitCoin! 32 trillion in real money!

Interesting, maybe I can justify a new graphic card purchase now. LOL.

I'd take your $6000 and give you back $3000 in 1 week.

They are probably selling right now.

Money goes poof.
@_date: 2013-04-16 03:42:40
So, have you sold yet?
@_date: 2013-04-14 04:06:02
It'll be canceled once they are ready to raid.

My condolences on your loss. Hopefully you learned a lesson here.

No book, I just seen it before, people fall for it most of the time. Heck back when BitCoin at around $2 the same thing was going on.
You used to be able to do "all or none" flag on real exchanges, that was awesome for fake bids.

These are usually fake.
