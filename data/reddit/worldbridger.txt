Hi shwag, Thanks for the question. 
DealCoin is based on a blind bidding system where dealers do not see the prices offered by others.
I expect this should help people wishing to buy / sell bitcoins to get better prices.
In my opinion, the price of any instrument should be related to the volume one may wish to buy or sell. 
On LocalBitcoins prices are set by equations based on market prices on other exchanges.
On DealCoin prices will be set based on market conditions, volume of coins to trade, member reputation.
We will also be offering an SMS notification service and a VOIP meeting service to our dealers and members.

Hi chipsandbiscuits. 
Below is the current situation on localbitcoins here in Europe: 
If I want to buy 1 whole btc via SEPA transfer, I'd have to pay around 688 EUR.
If I want to sell 1 whole btc  via SEPA transfer, I'd be paid around 610 EUR.
Meanwhile the price on GOX is 645 - 650 EUR. So the spread is a bit wider.
When trading for any commodity or currency, the amount you are willing to trade has always an impact on the bid offer spread. When market makers quote prices on trading floors, they always ask to know 2 things: who is it for (to assess counterparty risk) and the volume they wish to exchange. I am not sure why it should be different with bitcoins.
Regarding DealCoin fees, we don't charge monthly to sellers. We charge a very small monthly membership to market makers aka dealers. As little as 0.0047 btc / month. Direct deals are commission free and we charge from 0.5 to 1% for our escrow service.
The site design is in the making ;) We are in beta still. We have first concentrated our efforts on the back end. We are currently running a contest for our design with a reward of 2 bitcoins :)
Thanks for your feedback.

I understand and respect your point regarding the current state of democracy and its modern military incarnation. Democracy in its current embodiement is very far from its essence. Please do remember that morons are cultivated by the current education / cultural system. I can see a day when education can address the moron dilemma. But that's another conversation, in another forum ;)      
My point was more centered on the use of a P2P distributed ledger to manage reputation in order to provide some form of self regulated ecosystem where people could more easily protect themselves from thieves and scamers. If we could implement an annonymous and reputation aware ecosystem within the bitcoin, would it not benefit all of us?
Thanks for the tip ;)

Yes that would be a quicker way to achieve the goal. If peeps can recommend existing credit unions that they or their family already have accounts with. Anyone work at a Credit Union?

She said that as if somehow *we decided so together as a society*  
WTF!? Let's rewind history for a moment. Back to 1971, *Nixon decided* to drop the gold standard! With an [executive order]( Noting democratic there.  
We did not decide anything. That's why it is known in history as the **'[Nixon Shock](  
Gold never lost its quality as a currency... The US government lost its ability to be fiscally responsible.  
What a load of FUD!

You're welcome :) If you want to try out DealCoin, please remember to email your dealcoin username to reddit You will receive a free 3 months membership.
As for the design, if you're interested in designing the template, ultimately the photoshop design will need slicing in html and css. So you can apply :)
