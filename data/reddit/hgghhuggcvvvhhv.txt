Not really. You can see what price other people have paid, but that doesn't mean you can definitely get that price. If demand surges, your transaction might never confirm even though you paid more than someone right before you.


Maybe not. You might get your offchain ln BTC from an exchange or maybe someone directly pays you on ln.


The benefit of segwit comes when spending from a segwit output, so yea it doesn't really make a difference to the sender unless they already have their funds in segwit. It doesn't cost them any more to send from segwit to legacy than from segwit to segwit.

I kind of suspect the Catholic church somehow being behind creating a permissive environment for bitstamp to get going in Slovenia (Vatican was one of the first to recognise it as a country, and the church owns a lot of the infrastructure there). The first bank they used was the Slovenian branch of UniCredit (Italian bank).

It's likely to be somewhat contentious maybe worse than segwit was. Maybe not though. It basically it involves tricking legacy nodes into accepting more blocks than 1 every 10min. The new nodes could choose to still  see this as one larger 10min block although there are probably a few options there.. all this will fuck up the mining distribution schedule, but that can be corrected by paying the excess mining rewards into timelocked anyone can spend utxos to be re-mined in the future. As long as 51% of miners follow the new rules it works.
@_date: 2018-09-12 23:31:46
It could be done as a softfork at the expense of precision. Basically everyone's balance can be reissued "airdropped" inside a small block of btc. Then all other BTC are deprecated (miners refuse to mine transactions that don't originate from the small block). So far this isn't exactly an increase in tokens, but it allows the possibility to allocate some part of the small block (which represents all issuance) either to increase future mining or just allocate it to some new account for some common cause. You can readd extra precision on ln or perhaps even on chain for new non-legacy clients

The nonce is only relevant within the context of a block. There is probably something different about the nonce or block template sent to each miner such as adding a device ID to make sure they aren't duplicating work.

Tbh, I only skimmed it, but I guess the idea may be that it helps defeat people who connect to every listening node and perhaps setup a shedload of their own listening nodes in order to connect to everyone and see who broadcasts first. This might seem pretty ineffective at first glance, but when combined with change outputs, over time it might work quite well..
In any case you're right that it won't help if you have a wiretap on the end user.. which is pretty likely if you're talking about state intel

Ipv6 is much older than that.. RFCs from the mid to late 90s and probably industry working groups before that.. anyway, it's here now and is already doing a lot of traffic.. maybe as much as 50% in some countries like Belgium.

DAGs will need proof of work to be safe from Sybil attacks. If you add pow to a dag and add a p2pool scheme where miners can get paid for finding blocks between the official 10min blocks (something along these lines will probably happen eventually) then there would be no real difference between BTC and the pow dag.

You can get a personal loan for under 4% and then use it on coinbase with zero fees to save 1.5% and have the rate locked in for the duration of the loan. Also you get rid of exchange custody risk by withdrawing the BTC 
@_date: 2018-09-16 12:38:06
It can be done by soft fork. Take everyone s balance and pro rata give everyone a small share of a small block of btc. Then deprecate all other BTC that aren't a part of the small block (miners see legacy BTC as invalid transactions and won't mine them or build blocks on top of blocks that include them). Now that you have gained control of the supply via softfork, you can allocate future mining reward supply by paying the rest of the small block of btc to timelocked anyone else can spend transactions to increase future mining supply. In order to preserve as much precision as possible you might want to incentivize people to donate their BTC to be used as part of the small block by paying them a slightly higher percentage of the small block than people who don't.

Fidoruk is comical. It's ok for sepa'ing funds to Kraken or bitstamp, but I really wouldn't want to use it as an actual bank. Their debit card barely works, they only support outbound sepa - no inbound payments.. so you can only deposit by faster payments from another UK account. The faster payments are processed manually during business hours only. If the op goes for it, do not try and use it as a replacement bank. Just something to bounce bitcoin payments through.

The only reason to have tokens on chain was to do atomic swaps, but since we.now have cross chain swaps using hashed timelocked contracts, there may not be any advantage over having the tokens on their own blockchain, or really even a centralised database (since the tokens usually represent something inherently centralised like equity or debt or a warehouse receipt)

Due to the multi tier financial system there's really no way to guarantee that (and it for sure isn't the case). Xbtprovider is probably keeping one BTC for every 1btc worth of notes that they issue, but there's no guarantee that when you buy a note in your brokerage that they actually buy one.. and even if they do there's no gut they won't sometimes lend it out.. also it's likely that they hold the note via some other bank who may also lend it out. What you actually have in your brokerage is a liability through possiblity 3 or 4 other entities (brokerages, banks, custodians) any of which are unlikely to always be 100% backed by a real note 100% of the time.

When you open a channel with A probably A has no balance in the channel yet (until you spend some btc) so B can't send you anything via A yet. If you spend some btc such that A now owns some or all of the funds in your payment channel then A can now route a payment to you from B if they feel like it.. provided the payment is less than or equal to the amount of funds A has in the payment channel with you. Payment channels are just multisig BTC addresses and you can only receive what some counterparty has in a multisig with you. There is no fractional reserve. All the BTC you could ever receive on ln is in multisig addresses that you are a party too.

Transactions spend inputs which are previous transaction outputs and create new transaction outputs. If you make a transaction with an input that isn't in the blockchain, it can't be confirmed. If the input is an unconfirmed transaction then it has to be confirmed first but your transaction could still show up as unconfirmed too. If a node receives a transaction that tries to spend an input it hasn't even heard of then it can just ignore it and not even display it.
