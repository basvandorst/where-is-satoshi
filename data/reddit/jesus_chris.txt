Do I have to pay taxes on profits from holding bitcoin long term (&gt;1 year) in Belgium? I have tried researching this myself and from what I could find, there are no capital gains taxes on bitcoin profits after holding at least a year because Europe has declared it "legal tender".

adaptive-n-factor-scrypt is not x11. I think darkcoin uses x11 (11 different algorythms), while vertcoin uses scrypt-N, where the memory requirements increase with time. I don't know much about x11, but scrypt-N doesn't make a coin ASIC-resistant. It does however, limit the timespan for a scrypt-n ASIC to make a ROI. This makes ASICs unprofitable (but not unfeasible).

When you compare bitcoin and dogecoin it's easy to become biased. Bitcoin has been around for a while so when the bitcoin community generously helps some sort of charity, the news wouldn't have as much of an impact compared to dogecoin donations. A concept based on something so silly but has still achieved real world accomplishments is far more interesting to report and read on. Because of that, I think dogecoin news makes people passively biased, even if the achievements of the doge- and bitcoin communities are equal.

Is this a good brain wallet pass-phrase? It's generated with this algorithm:
All I have to remember is the elementary logic of the hashing algorithm, and the short protopassword.
The complex pass-phrase has a length of 32 times the proto-password's length. So even a single word can be reasonably secure.
Last time I posted this, someone told me it is not secure, but their reasoning was that md5 is easily cracked (though I don't see how this is relevant since the algorithm itself is also secret information, part of the brain wallet).

Kraken.com is a uk based exchange. They also have id verification, but it's not as tedious of a process as on bitstamp or gox. It works in tiers, providing just your name, address, and phone number gives you tier 2 verified. This enables you to do a limited amount of funding. Provide the documents they ask for at other exchanges and that limit will increase. Getting started took me less than a day. Kraken has low volume though, but at least that means it is quick and easy getting money in and out of your account.

Even if they can do anything, they probably won't. Suppose they succeed in making bitcoin irrelevant somehow. To do this, they are sure to spend a lot of time and money. But there are dozens of other crypto currencies out there, and there is no limit to how many more may be created or cloned. On the off-chance some entity is successful in their attempts to crash or break bitcoin, the next most popular crypto would take over, and in an angry response of the user base, many more will be created. 
Think of crypto currencies as the mythical hydra. Each coin is a head, with bitcoin being the strongest. You can cut off a head (not very easily), but many more will grow back in retaliation.
So how to kill the entire beast? Cut off all heads at once (eg. Sacrifice the entire internet by cutting some wires in the ocean), but this will anger more people than necessary.

During these times of great volatility, people will try to sell high and buy back in when the price is lower. However, it's not really possible to predict where the top and bottoms will be. If you try to daytrade, you're up against tons of trading bots that can make decisions faster than humans.
Even if you try to day trade, and make some nice returns, it will give you a false impression of your own ability to call the highs and lows in the market. You actually can't, so don't try it unless you're okay with losing large amounts of money.

The secret "file" and passphrase are not a file or a passphrase to a wallet at all. They're the ingredients to produce such a passphrase, and they exist nowhere other than the user's own memory no hard drive in the world will contain the algorithm as long as you personalize it a bit (this isn't too hard).
This is an alternative way to come up with a secure brain wallet, but in this case you don't have to remember 20 unrelated words or something. Just a short phrase and some basic logic. Neither of these things exist anywhere other than your mind. That's why it's called a brain wallet. In my example, the basic logic rules for the algorithm combined with a proto-password consisting of 10 characters, will produce a brainwallet's true passphrase consisting of 10 seeded MD5 values, as such it will have a length of 320 characters. That's definitely more than the length of an ordinary passphrase consisting of 10-20 english words (if that many), and it is easier to remember as well. I don't understand your criticism at all. The passphrase my example produced would take trillions upon trillions of centuries to crack with brute force.

I see your point but have you considered that with this method, the algorithm is just as secret as the proto-password?
Note this part: complexpassphrase += md5( md5(char) + md5(passphrase) + md5(complexpassphrase) )
The final passphrase consists of as many md5 values as there are characters in the proto-password. Each of these md5 values is the hash of a character, seeded with the hash of the complete proto-pass AND the hash of the complex password up until that point. So the seed will change for each character. 
Now, if an attacker doesn't know the protopassword nor the algorithm / seeding system that you use to generate the resulting passphrase, how are they ever gonna crack it? Bruteforce will take a long time since the passphrase doesn't consist of words or anything even close to that, and its length will be 32 * [proto-pass length]. 
By the way, it doesn't have to be md5, but that was just an example. Obviously the algorithm to make the passphrase more complex can be anything at all.
I'm don't claiming I know this to be uncrackable for sure, but you don't have me convinced that it is useless. Care to explain how someone would go about beating this?

Hi, I have a question for you. How is Bitstamp any better than Gox in that regard? When I made an account on Gox, I noticed I needed to verify before I could place funds. So then I switched to Bitstamp where I just had to sign up and I could start trading my funds immediately without any kind of verification.
Now, a few months after signing up and after doing a bunch of daytrading (30d vol &gt; 5000 USD), it seems I suddenly have to provide a scan of my ID among some other things before I can deposit or withdraw any funds. Not even withdrawal of BTC is possible until I verify.
@_date: 2013-11-08 16:00:20
I have not admitted to anything, this is just a way of making a passphrase more complex but easy to remember that I thought of. I don't even have a brain wallet.
Also, the algorithm can be modified at will. For example you can use different hashing methods, put the variables in a different order, add some kind of seed, ... There are infinitely many ways to "personalize" such an algorithm. Even adding a unique static seed such as your first name would generate a very different output while not making it much harder to remember. Is it still insecure if you do this? 
Edit: if the brain wallet miners don't know which exact algorithm or seeding pattern I use, they'd have to generate an almost endless amount of branches for EACH of the entries in their table. This doesn't just double their work, but makes it infinitely more complex. And why would they do this? On the off chance that they woul find the few wallets that have been generated like this? They now have to find not only my "proto password", but also the secret algorithm, which can be anything. The algorithm I described in that link is just a concept, not something I encourage anyone to use.

Correct me if I'm wrong, I've tried google but I can't find a clear answer...
Bitcoin can be divided up to a hundred millionth of a bitcoin. That's 0.01 µBTC. Despite this, the network will reject transactions where the value is less than 50 µBTC to limit the growth of the blockchain's size. This means you can send or receive 50.01 µBTC, but not 0.01 µBTC.

@_date: 2013-11-04 04:22:15
I have an idea to make a seemingly random, long password that is unguessable but easy to remember.
1. Start out with a normal password that's easy to memorize, for instance it could be "ToTheMoon!"
2. Invent a simple algorithm that will make the passphrase more complex. 
 
    *passphrase* = "ToTheMoon!"
    
    *complexpassphrase* = *null*;
    for each *char* in *passphrase*
    {
      *complexpassphrase* += md5( md5(*char*) + md5(*passphrase*) + md5(*complexpassphrase*) )
    }
    return *complexpassphrase*;
In my example, you only have to remember a short proto-password, and a unique algorithm which you can build however you see fit. 
The proto-password "ToTheMoon!" processed through the above algorithm, will reveal the following string, which is the true passphrase to your brainwallet: 
     de44889b980820ed257c7b96630cf6878a86f32902f7afd312d144a7256462c3b1d56816179c6b8c17479c675a6d09e92e5b0dd53b19e0c4474884d657783cb13f8d962a128b09f3ffeac41e61616a490b7c075ca176d3fc3f3a432200c1c78e90dbee69f38c7aac06df57d6c77b639572b12360f24595a6395cd33e5ddb01d499163ecb66b52ebdc1502cada4539d7086d75e518c7734debf25e6b10334ad0a
If anyone wants to play around with this, you can do so [here]( I'm an absolute noob at security, and I've never even used a brainwallet, but can anyone tell me why this is not a good idea? The only things you need to remember are a short string, and some basic logic, but in return you get a massive passphrase that would probably take a while to bruteforce

For the price to reach $0, there would have to be no demand at all. Even if the price were to crash dramatically, there would be a LOT of people who see their chance to get in for cheap, and the price would be corrected again.

I'm in the same boat, but you don't seem to understand that these new ID verification rules are there for every action besides trading. You mention it's extremely easy to deposit funds but hard to get them out. This false conclusion is a result of your unfortunate perspective. You got the funds in easily before sept. 2013, and now you want them back but you need to verify your account. That does seem shady. But if you were to sign up to Bitstamp today, you would need to provide the same verification documents before you can even add funds. So naturally, once you do this, it'll be easy to withdraw.
TL;DR: Verification also applies on deposits. By the way, they are probably obligated by law (or strongly encouraged by their lawyers) to make their users go through the slow process of verification.

Couldn't there be an organization where individual bitcoin exchanges can get a seal of approval and become a member if they follow certain guidelines? This org could help spread the user base pretty much equally over its member exchanges, which, along with perhaps improving bitcoin's resilience in other ways, would be its main purpose.
Exchanges could only become a member if they show they really care about bitcoin and its users. Guidelines should include personal security, trading volume ~= to the other member exchanges, etc...
What would motivate these exchanges to become a member is the users' trust in a more stable trading platform.
Of course such an organization should have crowd sourced rules and complete transparency to prevent fraud.

Is that really true though? If it is so easily synthesized, why would the intelligent folks on the nexus be so preoccupied with extracting the spice from ACRB, or MHRB (which has become really hard to find online)? Is it just because it's cheaper than synthesis?

I was just thinking about you earlier today, and how your store should totally accept bitcoin. The only thing that's been putting me off (for many weeks) from ordering some of your products is laziness. If I could just send you a BTC transaction it would be very convenient ;)

I've found a couple that are legit, but Bitvisitor is the most convenient one.
look at a website for 5 minutes, get small uBTC rewards, repeat. When at least 60uBTC is accumulated, it's sent to your wallet. Reaching the send limit takes me 2 days on average.

This one is also promising. You can get 2uBTC every hour. I think the send limit was 50uBTC. You can also do some provably fair gambling with the earnings before they are sent to your wallet

Getting free BTC from these websites can be fun, but don't expect any significant rewards from any of those sites

If you want to make jokes you should go to instead. Don't bother replying.
