Are dark net markets even doing very well? Even if you assume 100% of all bitcoin traffic is buying drugs that seems like a microscopic fraction of the drug trade.

You get that the digital currency they mean is normal people real money, not bitcoin.

He's the answer for people that admit australian satoshi is probably real but wish it would be someone who was a little more dead so he can't mess up bitcoin's cult revenance of the besainted satoshi.

Nah man, I took an economics 101 class and it totally said that if you print less money a day it magically makes 7 billion dollars magically appear into the bitcoin market cap. 
(don't ask me where that 7 billion dollars is supposed to come from, I never took economics 102 to find out.)

Like yeah, lots of systems work really well if only a few people use them. As long as bitcoin never needs to grow much the scaling plan we have is really super good.

A majority of bitcoin nodes are fake. A single person can run hundreds. The specific ones that dropped today are all 'classic' nodes, but don't for a second think that only classic runs these false node clusters and the rest are real.

Yeah, just buy some bitcoin. Just send your passport to some company in slovinia with unknown owners.

Yeah, I remember the time robin hood printed his own currency to rival the king (then kept 10% of the currency that will ever exist for himself)

Did it raise 117 million or did it raise some "if you multiply this number by this other number by this other number you get 117 million"? 
Because 117 million US dollars is a different number that ether tokens as valued in bitcoin as valued in USD. 
Like there is TRILLIONS of dollars of world of warcraft gold in the auction house, but only because you can't actually make that conversion like that.

Many many many many people have lost money on bitcoin. It's popular around here to tell eachother that you just need to wait and it's gonna be free money but going by transaction counts and by number of addresses a majority of people that have bought into bitcoin are currently holding bitcoin worth less than the price they bought at OR missing bitcoin from the numerous losses and thefts of major websites. Stories of people making big bucks are fun, but it's rare. 
(now people will tear my post to shreds because they are the people holding coins that are at a loss and they need to convince new marks to buy in at higher and higher prices to get back to zero)

In this system you can lock everything you own up with starbucks then if you need to buy something at mcdonalds you can just pay an additional fee and pay at mcdonalds. If you want to pay at burger king you might need to pay 3 or 4 fees if they don't connect directly to starbucks. 
(which is a baffling system that I can't even imagine anyone ever agreeing to)

It's only at the brink of catastrophe if you believe bitcoin will get more than 250,000 daily user any time soon. Which seems unlikely but you can't say it's unlikely because that makes bitcoin sound real bad.

Okay, but why would the US ever move to an economy that required sending billions of dollars to rodger ver to implement? Why wouldn't they just not do that?

r/bitcoin has the fewest readers it's had in years, it has about half as many page views at it did a year ago and less subscribers now than in 2015

No matter what wallet you pick when you lose your money the whole sub will tell you it's your fault for picking that wallet. 
If you use a web hosted wallet people will tell you you should have never trusted someone else to hold your coins. But if you host your own coins people will tell you that noobs shouldn't try to manage their own stuff and you should have let someone else hold your coins for you.
