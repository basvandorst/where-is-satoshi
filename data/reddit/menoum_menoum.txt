Does it even matter whether they're backed or not by USD, if they're not redeemable for USD (as stated in their ToS)? What does it even mean to be "backed" by USD in that case?
Tether just looks like a big scam. USD goes in, USDT comes out, USD never comes out. Can't explain that!

It's a zero sum game. Do what you think is right

I'm sure Enron stockholders were delighted to know that.

Who conned you into it?
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:47:43
Is it though?

Yup. Smarter people are getting out now. Smart people didn't get involved in the first place.

Not a troll, just a non-believer.

Don't waste your time. Learn maths or physics or programming, or actual investing. (BTW buying crypto is speculation not investing.)
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:07:28
No, but it could be argued that hodling BTC consitutes gambling, given the wildly fluctuating price.

Any publicity is good publicity in the Trump era.
