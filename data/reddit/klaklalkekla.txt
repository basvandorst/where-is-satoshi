It was called the Beef O Brady bowl before this, I think its a step up.

Because he's just a leftist.  He says nothing revolutionary.  He has lots of charisma and a quick tongue so people just fawn over him without even thinking about what he's saying.  
Take money from the rich, profit is a dirty word (not for his bank account apparently), give money to poor people, give houses to poor people.  Yeah where have I heard that before.

its either on the namecoin forum or huntercoin forum.  They donate 100 HUC a day.  Not huge, but its something.

He says great revolutionary things like "Profit is a dirty word". 
He says nothing new, he basically sounds like a college kid that just got into the utopian  idea of communism.

When someone tells me something, first I see if they practice what they preach.  I'm going to listen to Michael Moore telling me about greedy heads of corporations and the evils of capitalism when he owns multiple beautiful luxurious houses and lives like the people he tells us are bad? 
Their thinking is nothing new.  But add a nice british accent and a quirky joke here and there, and people think he's spewing revolutionary rhetoric.

I think traditional teachers are great and necessary in some specialized fields.  But For all the rest there is always someone on youtube ready to teach you whatever you want to know.  You can go to college to learn programming and pay all that money and take all that time, or watch a few youtube vids and take a class on coding academy.  Seems the need for lots of teachers is dwindling.

Do you people realize the earth has been warming way before humans were burning coal? Or Soccer moms were driving around in SUV's?  How do you think the Great Lakes formed?  What about the grand canyon.   Are these catastrophes? Time goes back further than 1880 or whenever records began being kept.  Most "Climate Deniers" (love this word) such as myself simply believe its natural and no amount of carbon taxes and what have you will reverse it.

They also donate to huntercoin development.  Great pool

Their stance is that everyone should have everything they need provided for free.  Michael has a few houses, when will he be letting some poor homeless people stay in them? Yeah not gonna happen.  When will they be giving up most of their net worth to the poor?  
The point of their stances do not matter.  I can say anything, but if I'm not doing it myself, its just empty words.  (sells books though)

Thanks for caring about us Buttcoiner.

I'm saying people like him who want more government to run everything, cause way more problems than they solve.  Listening to someone like Brand or Michael Moore telling me that profit is a dirty word while at the same time raking in millions from books and movies is hilarious to me.

What kind of things could you use this for?  I've been learning Javascript over the last month.

How long till liberals start trying to get people fired from their job because of their beliefs about the climate.  I don't think its too far off considering what they have done recently.
