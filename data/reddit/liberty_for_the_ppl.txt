Thank you for keep replying.
But let's just agree to disagree.

Yes, but it scares me to see the level of dumbness from many who've bought into the phony narrative of a flippening to that shitcoin.

A solid sign they think they're starting to lose it: the first "Can we please just compromise?" post in a while.

Give the shit to them and get your S9.

Buy that shit with bitcoin, so you can relieve the poor soul before you.

Come on people, don't you realize that you are probably being played here?
As others have rightfully pointed, it's not the second worst, there've been some others worst than this one.
How come someone being smart enough to make this analyses but don't know this fact.
How about the intention to be only to spread the narrative that being the second worst we are on the blink of another -92% BTC drawdown.
No amount of discussion can unveil the truth because intention cannot be argued, but a health amount of suspicious is due.
I applaud you pointing the truth, but your tone is naive at best.
We have many examples of posts like this everyday which are probably malicious, but are received with naivety and discussed as though they were diverse legitimate views.
I'm afraid liberals complete domination of education have produced this everywhere.

What you think are "Capitalist states" are, in fact, socialist ones in varying degrees of socialist domination.

One should not dissociate ownership and command power that it grants.
What use can owning bitcoin keys inside your bitcoin wallet serve if it cannot send or receive bitcoins.
What use can a bitcoin wallet serve if when you go send them they won't arrive because your wallet send them on the wrong network.
What use can a bitcoin wallet serve if you are wating to receive bitcoin from someone inside it on a previously generated receiving address and they won't arrive because it monitors the wrong network.
Trust can be broken between parts, liabilities can arise from broken compromises (many are time constrained).
Advanced users are a tiny part of any mobile wallet userbase and although prudence is advisable on those moments a wallet shouldn't deceive their users,  specially the non-advanced ones.
@_date: 2017-09-24 20:52:59
He's right tough.
Can't wait for bitcoin to succeed to make difficult for leftists stealing the money they use to ruin everyone's life.
@_date: 2017-09-28 13:10:02
Be careful as Breadwallet will follow the longest chain in case of a hardfork, and not the valid chain.
If B2X attack fork happens they will probably have the long chain initially, so they will abandon bitcoin chain and carry you together.
As B2X shit won't have replay protection, they will bring doom to their users.
You own the keys but you don't know of what.

Stop repeating and arguing against their propaganda on merit, please.
Block size increase, unify community, etc., are just excuses to take over the repo (won't happen).
Every reasonable person knows that.

Thanks for the reply.
I've just thought your headline question seemed to exclude intermediary positions by emphasizing so much the extremes.
Bitcoin sucks as money. It sucks as store of value.
It's great as money and store of value.
We can spend all day long arguing all those positions with valid arguments.
i think we have to emphasize bitcoin's fundamentals and potentials and understand it's not one thing or the other.
It's started more as a store of value than money, but then as its potential continue to materialize via infra-extructure building, it'll suddenly take money function by storm too.
