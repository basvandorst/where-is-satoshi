Looks like they deleted their post.

It's actually many transactions this time. Here are the 5 largest transactions I've seen on their API in the ~20 hours I've been tracking data:
* 
* 
*  -- not shown up yet at time of posting
* 
* 
I'll be making it so anyone can go to coinsight.org/mtgox to navigate recent large transactions and search for specific transaction/address logs at some point today hopefully.
*Edit: Largest 250 Mt.Gox API BTC transactions in the past 24 hours now viewable here:

About 12 hours ago, the total outputs of all transactions they were trying to send did total 450k+ BTC. I suspect they're still just shuffling around the 200k BTC from that original transaction last week, so the 450k BTC would be from them reusing inputs a bunch of times to create invalid transactions. You can see here, they tried to reuse this 2-outputs transaction as an input 11 times: 
Obviously, the inputs can't be double spent like that so the actual number of real transactions that went through was two. The rest were cleared from Mt.Gox's API (and presumably their wallet software) once they realized the transactions weren't going through.

There has also been no spike in the "users here now" number on With no obvious reason for a massively disproportionate number of users suddenly deciding to subscribe, I'm going to go with either bots or reddit accidentally made a default sub.

Hello. I run the Coinsight Mt.Gox BTC Transactions web page you linked to. 
I haven't got a log of the individual transactions, unfortunately. My Mt.Gox bitcoin tx page uses code from an IRC bot I had previously written that just spit out the sums you see now.
Here's the data I do have from that time period, though. Maybe there's a transaction that matches the amount added and then removed:
    time, outputs, count
    1394188832, 65.38414292, 59
    1394188108, 63.73329401, 55
    1394187387, 63.73329401, 55
    1394186668, 63.4605858, 54
    1394185950, 64.71350729, 54
    1394185225, 62.68436978, 51
    1394184501, 20062.67436978, 52
    1394183783, 62.68436978, 51
    1394183061, 62.68436978, 51
    1394182340, 82.38299384, 57
    1394181623, 82.38299384, 57
    1394180905, 82.38299384, 57
    1394180180, 82.38299384, 57
    1394179465, 82.38299384, 57
So the transaction has 19,999.99 BTC in outputs and was first broadcast around 7:30am UTC, with Mt.Gox seeing the first confirmation slightly more than two hours later.
Haven't done much searching, but this transaction seems to roughly match the amount and initial broadcast time:  -- still doesn't explain why Mt.Gox wallet software did not see the confirmation until it appeared on their public "stuck transactions" API. Hope that helps a little.

For people looking for an actual BTC transaction, here's my post from another thread about the information I have: 
Maybe someone else has a log of the raw transactions they'd be willing to share?

Thanks for the tip! I tried last Friday and their web site told me it wouldn't accept debit cards, but I entered the same card just now and it worked.
