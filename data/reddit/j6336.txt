Ridiculous articles like this buy the average person more time to accumulate cash and buy more BTC. Don't waste anytime because you don't know when the Big Money will come in. This guy just gave you x amount of time to accumulate BTC with his stupidity, thanks crazy Forbes guy!

Exactly this. Same goes for stocks. DCA is a proven winning strategy in the markets... Unless you find a crystal ball or something and can see the future. DCA all day.

Bullshit, fight fire with fire. If you guys want to lose Bitcoin to the big blockers with 2x, then take this 'be a nice guy advice.' Remember 
what place nice guys finish in!!   Play nice, with kid gloves, like fucking idiots would. Can't wait to see you all crying once this ridiculous plan fails. I told ya so. 
Only pussies and losers are afraid of confrontation and when you lose 'nicely', stfu and GTFO forever. No one needs your baby bullshit. Fight fire with fire.

Keeping yourself out of inflation is literally survival. Study some history

I agree with you totally but in this case I think they already have those persons of interest under a 'soft' lock down. I think the commenter above just dismissed the seriousness of the situation regarding communist regimes when they tell someone specifically you're not allowed to leave.

It is only negative to a hyper consumer economy relative to a more stable / less credit based economy. The United States has had periods of rapid growth in times where the credit markets were tiny fraction of what they are today. Again I'm not saying this is likely, but there are scenarios in which the culture and the economy shift back to conservative fiscal policies and bitcoin could be a great tool in that economy. Might take a serious crisis first, which will hurt all assets, Bitcoin included. The next few years of negative interest rates around the world will be interesting.

Lol dude you Segwit2x guys just constantly get owned, does it ever stop hurting haha

I love that chart. 
I don't want to misinterpret any commenters here but it seems like most think hyperbitcoinization has to be a hostile type of event against multiple governments at once. It could turn out that way, but there are other possibilities. At least in the beginning stages because Bitcoin encourages SAVINGS, in a massive way. There are scenarios where this will be beneficial to governments. This is how it can grow peacefully until some kind of singularity event. The cultural value of people increasing their savings and investments can lead to all sorts of policy changes where Bitcoin is welcomed and encouraged on a global scale.

I know it seems like a long time ago and I'm not saying you're wrong.. It isn't as bad as it once was but point in trying to make is that it isn't that big of a stretch for them to hold someone against their will. If one person can break the rules without consequence, then China would start to have a billion other rule breakers on their hands. Originally he said he didn't understand how China could keep someone from leaving a land locked city, I was just trying to make the point that with a few threats and some weapons it's not very difficult at all and certainly not beyond the realm of possibility.

They don't want an olive branch they want a centralized coin and with weak people like you they have a chance. I can't imagine how bad women walk all over you with that kind of attitude lol. "I'll do whatever you say! Please just tell me what to think! Don't yell at me please just like me... Please please!" Pathetic, stand up for what you think is right for once it will be alright.

Not a chance there buddy...

I don't think you understand how communism works, at all. If they say you don't leave, then you don't fucking leave. End of story. Or if you do try to leave it'll be with multiple bullet wounds in the back... They have secret police, they know where your family is, where your money is, they own everything. People have been trying to leave your decades with very little luck.

This x 1,000,000
Trader mentality - I can make a quick thousand(s) or I can lose a quick thousand(s) - Sign me up!
Investor mentality -  I can hold because a few thousand bucks doesn't change my life, literally at all,  and see if this investment creates a massive return that any investor would envy and have a positive impact on my life.
This is a simple choice when you think rationally.

Just watch the first 1:30 of this Warren Buffet video real quick and just listen to the man. 
"Focusing on the prices or what they are doing is a terrible way to invest"  Does it really matter what is does today if in 10 years you have made enough money off of a reasonable investment to pay off your mortgage or set yourself up for the future... Not at all. 
And for those who are interested in negative interest rate talk you'll enjoy the second half of this 5 minute vid.

this guy! knowing full well I should wait to see if new high was made first but went for it anyway hah

Ok but you need to understand size of the asset class matters. Gold is just under 10 Trillion. We are 45 Billion. If this asset is to grow into a trillion dollar market, there will be derivatives markets attached. Period. Full stop. People do not invest that amount of money without insurance aka puts. 
@_date: 2017-07-25 16:47:52
Why does this surprise or scare you? Options markets apply to every other asset in the world, you want more markets, not less. Liquidity and adoption will only help BTC. How did you come to the conclusion that derivatives increase the total supply of the asset btw

If you take advice from certified lunatic John McAfee you are a damn idiot and your opinion is worthless.
