It'll keep dropping. Give it 7 days before you even consider.

I will never, ever completely sell out of a coin. Even shit coins, I'll leave a minimum of $50 value. $50 at 0.06c is $5 million today.

He was up at 3.5 btc at one stage.. 
His post could have very much been about how good alts are.

Bitcoin and all cyrpto is a highly uncertain market which is what gives it such a high profitability potential.
At the moment it's purely driven by hype. The only way for you to get a return on investment is idiots buying into it at a higher rate. But guess what! You where also an idiot that bought inti it higher than someone else.
As long as you're not the last idiot then there is money to be made.

It will crash or at least dip. Nothing last forever. That being said it might go high as 7500k before that happens.

Unless the marketcap of bitcoin exceeds the entire worlds GDP itnis no longer possible to get 2011 gains.

Very true ahaha. Wont be so bad if they're paper wallets. And lets be honest. If you had 500 alts with $50 one of them is bound to make some cash.

This is only because bitcoin is still in an adoption phase, where early investors get lucky.
The question is, is bitcoin being adopted because its a superior currency or is it just a "get rich" hype train? One will bubble, the other will grow for a very long time.

Crypto currency shouldn't be treated the same as traditional investing.
Crypto is for people who have no money to invest.
5%-10% return p.a. on $5000 is not really worth it. But 500%-1000% return is very worth it, and can happen with some crypto currencies.
This whole thing is a get rich quick scheme that might actually work, and has for others. Yet it's best to treat it like a game. I'm only ever going to have 10% of my saving in the market. (Which isnt very much).

Well at 1 stage you almost doubled your btc. After the post fork crash it probably would be staying around similar levels.
