The only thing quantum computing can do is try to derive your private key from your public key *after* you spend your coins. Meaning in the minutes before your transaction receives a confirmation, an attacker would have to get your public key, compute your private key, recreate the transaction, and beat yours to the blockchain. I'm not even sure such a thing will ever be possible, but as you said, bitcoin can adapt before this comes close to being a problem, and again, no one should expect this any time soon, if at all. 
Otherwise, your coins are perfectly safe sitting wherever they may be, as users are not supposed to reuse addresses after spending from them, and if you've never spent from your wallet, then your public key has never been revealed and therefore no one can derive your private key, and as a side note, private keys cannot be derived from your public address with *any* quantum computing algorithm ever. 
Tl;dr: Quantum computing isn't magic that can do anything, and any threat it poses is exaggerated

Well there's the most ridiculous thing I'll read today.

He's not talking about *you*, maybe re-read his comment first.

Milli means 1/1000 and micro means 1/1000000

Don't use bitaddress for private key generation. It's very easy to generate a random hexadecimal number yourself which is your private key. You can then use bitaddress offline to do any necessary conversions of your private key or for getting the public key.

A common way is to roll a 16 sided die, but there are other computer generated ways depending on your paranoia level, you'll have to search online. But yeah, once you have your private key then you can use any software offline, such as bitaddress, to do any conversions for you, such as calculating the public address. You can head over to bitaddress and play with it to see what it does.

Quantum computers have limits on what they can do and they will only be faster at certain tasks. Private keys will not be able to be derived from public addresses.

Yep I'm sure it was an inside job by bittrex for a measly 6btc compared to what they'd be able to take. 
@_date: 2017-09-28 19:19:44
There's nothing wrong with bittrex. It is much more likely that the OP did something stupid that he's not revealing or hasn't figured out yet. 
@_date: 2017-09-28 21:09:29
That's some fine victim blaming. Bittrex doesn't directly control Google search results, are you actually retarded man? Why wouldn't you report it to Google lol, who do you think bittrex is going to contact?

We don't know what they've done. For all we know some guy just posted a story on here. 
@_date: 2017-09-28 20:06:34
He has explicitly accused the staff of being responsible

Nice, just received 100k!

Not paranoid at all, you'd have to be a complete dumbass to use closed source software to generate your keys.
