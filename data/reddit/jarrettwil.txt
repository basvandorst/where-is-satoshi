I care about BAKKT because of the additional institutional money it will bring in. My understanding is that institutional money kicked off the current rally. I think BAKKT, ErisX, and LedgerX will usher in the next big leg up. Just my two satoshis.

Also, dollars can have a history (they have serial numbers), so are you now going to say a dollar is not fungible?

I'm really jealous. I would love for that to be my job assignment for a month.

But one BTC is exchangeable for another.
@_date: 2019-07-07 17:28:48
Wrong. A bitcoin is “untainted” by mixing a tainted one with non-tainted ones. The only reason this can happen is because bitcoin is fungible. 
 
(of goods contracted for without an individual specimen being specified) able to replace or be replaced by another identical item; mutually interchangeable.

How long will the beta test last? I haven’t found any indication of when the test will conclude.

I’m HODLing right there with you bitcoin bruv.

Knowing I’m not alone on this does make me feel a little better. Thank you!

If you said that to me, I would totally agree with you.

The 50 day MA just crossed above zero. We should see a pop in the next hour.
Edit: on the 30 min resolution

Omg! Thank you! I’ll sort by hot when I’m looking for it tomorrow. Thanks again!

Perhaps. It's hard to predict, but [this]( is what I'm referencing.
@_date: 2019-07-07 17:57:46
Omg y’all do not understand the meaning of fungible. Any combination of 100,000,000 satoshis (no matter how they were obtained or from where) makes 1 bitcoin. Ergo, bitcoin is fungible. Jesus Christ y’all are dense.
@_date: 2019-07-07 16:55:39
You need to look up the definition of fungible.
@_date: 2019-08-09 04:42:02
Based on trends and indicators, we will. But that’s like, my opinion...man.

Based on the 4hr, 12hr, 1day, 3day, and weekly charts, I think we’ll hit $14k+ by this coming Sunday. Just my 2 satoshis!

I've been waiting at least a year for this news. Buckle up and Hold On for Dear Life (HODL)
@_date: 2019-08-09 05:01:43
Based on the 4hr through the weekly chart, we’ll most likely touch $14k this weekend. 
@_date: 2019-06-21 17:19:02
I wouldn’t recommend buying anything with bitcoin at the moment. Spend your cash. Hodl BTC.
@_date: 2019-06-20 14:45:54
Because eventually each bitcoin will be worth significantly more. $9,000 will be considered cheap in a couple of years.

Long Bitcoin, short the banks. -Pomp
@_date: 2019-09-20 19:33:49
It's not a good idea to state how much BTC you own. I'm surprised someone hasn't jumped on you for this already. Be smart, stay safe, and hodl on.
@_date: 2019-05-27 04:54:04
Yep, many Bitcoins have been lost and many more will be lost, only further restricting the supply, along with the halvening, which slows production and incentivizes miners to hodl for a higher price.
@_date: 2019-05-29 06:06:05
I didn’t say it was THE catalyst for the interwebs, but porn, no doubt, played a significant part.
@_date: 2019-05-27 04:31:05
1. Limited supply - max total BTC that can be mined is 21 million, then there is the economic and political environment
2. Trustless - no banks (trusted 3rd parties) are needed to facilitate transactions
3. Decentralized - its value is based on neither a sovereign government nor a central bank.
4. BTC is fungible - its parts are interchangeable
(**and to your question...**)
5) To be useful as a day-to-day currency, BTC needs to be worth $1,000,000 USD. Once worth $1mil, one Satoshi will be worth $0.01 USD, which will allow BTC to be used as a day-today currency, with which you would be able to buy groceries, pay bills, etc...
6) The halvening -  [
And so many more reasons I am sure.
edit: shit
@_date: 2019-05-27 14:01:39
Yes, but $1,000 price swings at $10,000 are viewed as way more volatile then $1,000 price swings at $1,000,000. Basically, BTC needs to be worth more in order to address the issue of volatility.
The halvening might be baked in, but either way it will reduce the amount of supply, which naturally leads to an increase in value (assuming demand is unchanged).
@_date: 2019-05-29 04:16:06


Yep, porn was a catalyst for the internet, much like the illicit drug trade has been a catalyst of BTC. They both have vice in common. Weird.

Umm... that’s an early adopter
