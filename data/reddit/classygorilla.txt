Yes as other have said - initially it does but recovers quickly. Credit score is judged by numerous factors, like paying on time. One of the factors they calculate score is called credit utilization. So if you have only 1 card for a limit of 2k, and you utilize all 2k of that card before paying it off everymonth, it looks like shit. Or if you have 3-4 cards with 15K of credit card debt racked up looks bad.
If you have 10 cards with a total limit of 50k, only use 1 card for maybe 1-2k per month, your debt utilization looks pretty good.

No one would risk solo mining like that, they would join a pool and get a percentage of the reward.

Like exchange fees? You can rack up some pretty decent air mileage points buying crypto. Many cards have bonuses such as “spend 1000 in first 3 months get 75k points”. You were going to spend that money anyways, might as well have a couple free flights too.

It’s just doesn’t make sense. Who would spend all that money and time getting 20 miners up and running only to roll the dice like that? You can get guaranteed payout with a pool and earn a steady income vs a possible one time hit.

Think about even a decent salary saving to 90K:
60k/yr salary
4% company match - 8% into 401k = 4800/yr
market growth of 7% would take like 12 years to get to 90k.
Many people would be *very* happy with "at least getting the company match".

Dude he FOUND the coin. If his long term plan is to successfully keep finding random bitcoin for the rest of his life, he's set. This is a BS post anyways, redditor for 2 days.

You continue to imply that everyone is gambling with their life’s fortunes here. The OP also did not say that, only that now is a good time to invest due to the bullishness of the asset. 
“Only invest what you can afford to lose” really should be the base of all investment decisions, especially with bitcoin. This ship could go to zero tomorrow.
At the same time, people double down on btc because of failure of many financial institutions in the past, leaving a good, low-risk investment completely fucked despite any prudence.

Any sensible investment since 2014 has gained incredibly in the market, AGAINST a huge 2008/2009 correction. 
Hell, I think the S&amp;P is up 18% this year alone. My international index fund is up 33%.
I consider myself late into bitcoin, and my initial investment is up nearly 90% since mid october. 
Going around and saying things like "don't invest, you will get burned" is foolish. When the correct inevitably happens, you can say "told you so" but every correction in the history of the stock market ***and*** bitcoin, has recovered ***dramatically*** afterwards.
You can still grow your money, today, right now, and be out in a couple weeks with a volatile investment like bitcoin. The S&amp;P and other investments are looking like they will grow fantastically next year as well... 
Not saying anyone should just switch from their 401k to purely crypto, but god damn, the growth for even a slice of your portfolio is too tempting to skip.

I see what you are saying, but what I am saying is don't spend it all today. Save some for a dip and get it for cheaper. Like last week when it hit a high around 7700 and dipped to 5500. If you have some money saved, you were able to make a greater profit.

Use an exchange like gdax or gemini, low low fees.

While it may not be an issue, wouldn't it be prudent to maximize your investment? Otherwise you can just go ahead and give it to me :)

I bought the dip down and I'm already seeing a 15% return on those coins. Moving pretty fucking fast.

It would be more apt to say betting on ethanol mixed gasoline, since the technology does exist, someone is just trying to modify it.

You're missing the point. The "high-school graduate" could afford this house on a single income, no degree, factory job essentially un-skilled. Today that isn't feasible. You need college/training to be able to afford an entry level crap home, barely scraping by. Even then, you probably won't be able to save for a down payment anyways.

It seems unlikely that an organization will just quit after spending boat loads of money on mining equipment.

Okay so step one, go back 50 years, graduate highschool, get a job literally anywhere that pays 80K in wages comparable to today's value.
step 2, buy house

It's at an ATH right now. Might be better to throw in a couple hundred here and there over the next few weeks, dollar cost average. 
I don't know the future, but that's what I have been advising people to do. The swings can be fast and dramatic, would be good to have some "money in the stables" to be able to pick up at a discount. Hell, might surge to 10k by the next week. Who knows. Always a good idea though to have some money so you can buy a dip I think.
