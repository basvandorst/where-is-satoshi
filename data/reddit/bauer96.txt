Bitcoins price could also be viewed as a function of our willingness to pay. With decentralization, the law of supply and demand have heavy influence on the price (couple with FUD of course). But If I were to sell a bitcoin for 20k in a couple months and the market accepted that as the value for a bitcoin, then so be it. 
A lot of this bubble talk is from my friends, and others that have no idea what bitcoin/blockchain tech is. They just read headlines from bankers and accept that as true. Eventually there will be a clawback and all of these projects that don’t have any working code will disappear. However, until then let’s all just continue to argue with people we know about how bitcoin and other projects aren’t “scams” etc. ;)

Hardware wallet. Safest method to trade.

QuadrigaCX is working for me.

Yea, QuadrigaCX (Canadian) is working for me.

100% wallet. I would not be comfortable letting a third party have control over my investments. I use a ledger nano S for that reason.

This is pure genius.

That's nice. It's too bad that the two things we are comparing couldn't be any more different. Simply put Bitcoin inherently holds more value given its limited supply. Basic economics.

There is no guarantee that fiat will be in demand forever either. As long as something is generally accepted we could trade rocks haha

I believe it 100%. Following all of this market recalculation, we are going to see new heights. Panic sellers are making it better for us that understand the value in blockchain tech. Too many are blinded by media headlines.

There is going to be another large cash out in the near future.  and then  to the moon. 
@_date: 2017-10-17 15:43:59
It will go down once we hit a new high. I suspect a large cash out soon.

Bitcoin is both? I don't understand your argument. 
@_date: 2017-10-24 20:12:42
Hold. BTC will shake off the fork, and your average cost will remain lower than post fork.

Dkm. How many times have we been told this?

That is very true given that bitcoin has the potential to serve everyone. However, I think right now Blockchain &amp; Cryto as a whole is still a very niche market. Bitcoin is one of the only coins that main-streamers are aware of. Once the crypto market cap exceeds 1 trillion then I will fully agree ;)
