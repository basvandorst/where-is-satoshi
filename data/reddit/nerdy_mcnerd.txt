Well, a lot of people are speculating in bitcoin. More people are speculating than are using it. That's a really bad sign. If you want to use bitcoin for purchases, then have fun. If you want to invest your money, look elsewhere.

At this point you shut your mouth and ask for a lawyer. If you think they made some mistake and you are confused about what is going on, then you ESPECIALLY need to keep your mouth shut.

Um, Bitcoin has absolutely nothing to do with the Kardashev scale. That scale relates to energy production.

I think this only works if you are itemizing your deductions, not using the standard deduction which is most common.

Why would you ever do this?

Why would you bother posting anything to Facebook?

Ahem. In response to OP calling himself an idiot - no, you are not an idiot. The fact is that bitcoin is EXTREMELY difficult to use securely. It takes incredible technical acumen to be confident you know what you are doing. Knowing what techniques are safe and what techniques are not safe is not something a layperson cannot be expected to figure out. 99% of the public will not be using bitcoin securely if they ever decide to dabble into it. This post will likely be buried because most people on this subreddit don't want to give the impression that bitcoin is not suitable for mainstream use, but whatever.

Well, actually, energy consumption IS the fundamental metric that influences this scale. If you buy into Kardashev's thesis then all other considerations are mere blips along the way to a civilization's advancement. Even things like curing all disease, or the invention of the computer or self replicating machines are pretty small when compared to efficient fusion reactors or harnessing most of the energy output of a star. We're talking factors of 10^10 here. Fixing the global currency problems is maybe a factor of 2x utility to civilization, at best.

Wow. These people are evil. They are looking for any excuse at all to be as evil as possible.

Great article. This whole ordeal with Newsweek has me reminded of that movie, Shattered Glass. The parallels in that movie are that a reporter fabricates stories which are backed by the editors. And similar to this Bitcoin case, the reporter is undone when he takes on an internet story and loses control of it.

Except you forget that Bitcoin is inflated now due to speculators like yourself. You are on the wrong side of Buffet's quote, sorry.

Well, that's one way to mine btc...

Wow this is a great list. Really sums up lots of the issues with Bitcoin now.

Well, there is another aspect to this calculation that you're forgetting. You need to know what the actual chance is of either side winning. If the probabilities are 50:50 then yes, what you've laid out is a great way to play. But if it's 99:1 then you'd be throwing money away to play like this. If you have confidence that BTC will hit $2000 then you should just buy BTC and not take the bet. If you believe that it will be $200 then you should take the bet but not buy any BTC.

I don't think you understand what "government" means.

I smell a retraction coming from Newsweek... 
@_date: 2014-06-19 12:22:52
Wow. I didn't realize that subreddit existed. They pretty much sum up my reservations with bitcoin and why I will never use it (despite really liking the idea of cryptocurrency). 
@_date: 2014-04-11 00:28:00
The thing that is freaking people out are speculators like you who are gambling on bitcoin as an investment instead of actually using it as a currency.

Hilarious. She needs to stop brushing up on her gun skills and start brushing up on her legal skills. She and her rag are going to be sued, and if she thought she was afraid of some trolls on the internet wait until she starts getting letters from lawyers.
