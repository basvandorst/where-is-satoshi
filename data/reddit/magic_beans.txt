I know this is an old thread but if you're still monitoring this I have a question about trading I'd really appreciate an answer to:
I was wondering if a 'buy and hold' strategy with leverage was possible/worthwhile for BTC and, if so, which website one could use to do this? I've tried Bitmex but can't get my head around it, do you know of any good alternatives where you won't get killed on fees by holding long term?
An example of what I mean is having 10k in an account and using 1k of that to buy BTC with 10:1 leverage. Setting this up and then forgetting about it with a view to cashing out in several years time.
I'm having trouble figuring out the maths of this and if it would be any more worthwhile than just buying and hodling 10k of Bitcoin.

Thanks, I'm coming to the same conclusion myself, stuffed up the maths in my head. Thanks for answering my stupid question :D

Cheers, I think I get the gist of what you're saying about the "modular pseudonymity approach".  I've been reading up on EFF and they say a similar thing.
I've been doing what you mentioned about email addresses (PS. Do you know of an easy to set up one that can forward emails and delete msgs after a few days?  I've been using gmail to do this but it's a pain in the ass to try and make one without using phone verification).
I'd rather not go to the trouble of using Tor or a VPN (seedbox has OpenVPN installed).
My only options for obtaining the BTC are CC or paypal.  I was hoping to use the Bitcoin transfer as a kind of anonymous buffer (even if it just a partial one or a matter of degree).
Have set up Electrum and it looks great (thanks will look into localbitcoins and/or circle.com tomorrow.
Thanks for the reply man.

I'd like to get started with bitcoin to use it to pay monthly for a seedbox.  I want to use this instead of paypal to try and be a bit more anonymous.  What's the easiest way to do this?
According to this guide:  it seems having a wallet that rotates addresses is very important.  I'd also rather use a web-based wallet than download 20 GB of data (bitcoin core), however in that guide the web-based wallets all say:
*Discloses information to a third party*
*This service can associate your payments together, log your IP address and know your real identity if you provide personal information like your email, name or banking account.*
TLDR: Can you recommend a web-based wallet that is easy to use and reasonably anonymous (without going full on tin foil hat) or does that not exist?

If they are both the same in terms of anonymity which is the easiest/most beginner friendly: (Circle + Electrum) or Coinbase?  
I'd rather use a CC than a bankaccount so does that mean Coinbase is out?
One good thing about Coinbase I noticed is that they use rotating address which Blockchain doesn't appear to.
Also, if you don't mind could I ask why you said never to use Paypal?  I'm just curious.
Thanks again for your advice it's been really helpful!  And please excuse the delay in replying it's been a really busy day here.

thanks man ... would you say this is reasonably anonymous?  That was one of the ones in the guide that had this statement:
*Discloses information to a third party*
*This service can associate your payments together, log your IP address and know your real identity if you provide personal information like your email, name or banking account.*
I guess it's got to be more anonymous than paypal right?

Thanks for the tip!  Looks like using a CC on circle.com would be the easiest.  I live near the city but I'm kind of a hermit these days so not so into the local meetup option.

This is the desktop client right?  Do you have to download 20 gb worth of data with this one?
Edit: had a look on the site and it says no downtime, that it does notdownload bitcoin blockchain.  Sounds perfect!
