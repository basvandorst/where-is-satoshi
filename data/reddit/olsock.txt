Bitcoin is basically moved and manipulated by whales and money launderers. Gonna keep dropping. Not a solid investment for now
@_date: 2019-10-23 15:30:54
all these fuckers that downvoted me. where ya at now?
@_date: 2019-12-18 14:17:00
Correct. But only if you stopped investing at that point. Most people kept dumping in money.

Well i say money laundering because if the sudden massive sell off that these whales do. Like they'll leave a lot of money in bitcoin for a certain amount of time and sell it for no reason and it changes the price drastically. Its not safe until it becomes more stable. What other reason is there for the sudden price changes? Why is being pumped and dumped by the super wealthy?

That sounds good and all but the fact is if you've invested anything since July its all taken a loss. Which depending on how much that is, it could have wiped all gains from the first half of the year. Bitcoin is used for money laundering its not a safe investment for now. I'm guessing it will be in a month or two. I like the long term investment of bitcoin 5-10 years down the road. If you're fine with leaving money in it for that amount of time then good for anyone who does it.

IF you buy bitcoin on robinhood is it really yours? Is it a good idea to buy cryptos on robinhood?

Unpopular opinion....Isn't this a little worrisome that bitcoin is up 70% in a month? It's climbing way too fast. At what point do you start a small sell off to make sure you don't lose profit? then of course buy back in after the dip? could we see a correction at 12K, 15K or 20K? I believe well will see some major corrections soon if bitcoin doesn't slow down. Long term i'm all in. but i still don't want to sacrifice short term gains.
