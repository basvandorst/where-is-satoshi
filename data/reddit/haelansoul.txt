Research has shown regular mindfulness practice (3-5 days/week) makes measurable changes in the brain and nervous system. It creates more dense gray matter and develops greater neuroplasticity, which essentially translates to greater resilience to stress and greater awareness and control of your physical and emotional sensations. 
Mindfulness practice is best viewed as exercise for the nervous system. 
Download an app like Calm or Headspace, or find guided mindfulness clips on YouTube to listen to, in order to start learning how to do it.

No, but many governments are still accruing as much gold as they can fit in their vaults as a hedge for when fiat crumbles....

Look into establishing a Solo 401k. Since you can have gold, property, and other investments through them, I suspect you can add bitcoin too. Diversification is a good thing with a retirement fund though....

No argument that much of bitcoin's value comes from decentralization and fraud proof accounting. When I explain bitcoin to people outside of the space though, they seem to have some light bulbs turn on when I articulate how much energy is required to keep the mine game going through adding new transactions to the ledger. Bitcoin's miners (and the energy they use) are the ones who hold the system together and keep the blockchain going, so I am not sure the shovel analogy really fits.

Normal? This isn't normal. This is cryptocurrency entering the mainstream.
@_date: 2017-08-12 02:02:24
It was true then too. Full mainstream won't happen overnight.

Only one question: why is Dash listed instead of Monero? Market cap should not determine how much better a coin is.... Source:  r/monero

Haha, I guess you're right

Afterall, the value of BTC is still measured in relation to USD.

Many people enlist on values of service to their country. Whether or not the country is at war is irrelevant to them. It is the notion of service that drives them. If they enlist to serve and end up being sent to war, that wasn't necessarily their choice. Again, the strongest anti-war advocates I know are combat vets.

Being someone who has experienced war first hand, I'm not a fan of it either. Try not to mistake wars for the people who get sent to fight them. Those people often end up being the strongest and most legitimate proponents against war.

You mean Monero? r/monero

Multisig seems pretty secure by having own seeds though
