I read the sidebar, I understand that it could be off topic, but hear me out. If the hivemind decides this isn't relevant, they'll down vote, that's what it's for.
* $100m is &gt;1/4 of all money invested in BTC in 2014. [coindesk](
* "[WorldRemit] processes 250,000 transactions per month, and has been steadily growing revenues, with $25 million in sales in 2014, compared to $9.3 million in 2013."
* WorldRemit lets users in 50 countries send money, and people in 117 countries receive it, giving senders the option to pay into bank accounts, cash pick-up points, or into mobile wallets that can be used for airtime top-ups.
Remittances, along with micro transactions and large B2B transaction are the major opportunities for Bitcoin, yet we spend most of our time talking about competitors who have existed for 20 years. The reason these opportunities are so interesting is that in theory these use cases take advantage of BTC in a unique way that appeals to a wider audience than the tech/libertarian who wants to keep the government out of their money. In theory, Bitcoin is faster, cheaper and/or more reliable than the competitors that exist.
Yet, there are plenty of centralized start ups that are starting to offer those services. If speed and convenience is all that consumers are looking for, then bitcoin loses that competitive advantage.
These guys were founded in 2010. Has any Bitcoin remittance solution (or even the entire Bitcoin remittance industry) matched the pace of growth that these guys have?
I think it's a fruitful discussion to compare the two. Are there properties of Bitcoin that really appeal to these markets, if only they had the right information? Or are they picking the product whose services appeal to them most?
