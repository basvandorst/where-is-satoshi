No. It's probably going to get cheaper. If you're eager, go ahead and pick it up, but I suspect it will hit the $400's soon. Previously, a lot of BTC value was event-driven, however the altcoin landscape has affected things and there are a lot of other drivers behind its falling price. You will be able to get it cheaper in the coming weeks. Spend some time identifying what incentives are required for BTC price to go higher and you'll better understand why it will just continue to drop in the short-term future.

Interesting--thanks for the heads up.

Thanks, this is exactly what I was looking for. 
I actually found the BTCtalk thread yesterday, but for some reason my account (several months old at this point) is still apparently too new to post or PM anyone so will have to give registration another go and check it out, too.

I would have to agree that government agency adoption isn't necessarily required. It's the financial institutions (namely, those who are investing, driving interest rates, etc.) that will determine how fast its adopted and how it supports other currencies. 
I know some investment banks are hedging using bitcoin at a very small extent, but it's not a primary trading vehicle or instrument. The market itself doesn't see enough daily volume relative to other trading vehicles like CBOT, NYSE, TSX, etc. which are largely controlled by big banks sinking in large amounts of money to manipulate the market. You just don't see that going on in the BTC world (yet.) Could be a couple of years, but my inkling is that it will be much longer and there's an equal possibility that Bitcoin itself won't be adopted, but rather a regulated digital currency that's separate from BTC.

Unfortunately I need to use Dwolla to pay--there aren't any local deposit centers near me.
