There is profit...for those who have the ability to buy in at any reasonable quantity. With student debt still in the tens of thousands I don't really have that luxury. This is why I am both a little jealous at, and happy for, all those who made Bitcoin into essentially their life. I come from a very poor family, I know what it is like to have little. It is because of this experience I can be happy for those who now have more.
Keep being awesome BTC-C and don't spend it all in one place!

It's just hard to fathom BTC getting any higher than it already is. At $20k it almost feels like the peak and that is the danger - if it is. LTC or ETH has room to grow, though whether it will in relation to BTC is the real monster question.
Now I recognize BTC has room to grow, I just cannot wrap my mind around how.

Like many I wish I had known about BC years ago. It is hard to not be a bit jealous. Still, can't miss what I never had so...congratulations to all who took a chance and got in early.

Hello, it's me, your charity.
Seriously though, this is incredibly generous of you. Thank you.

No it isn't. This is exactly the amount of my current student debts. I'd be floored if I found enough bitcoins just lying around that'd make my debt disappear.

The creation of something new and unique doesn't take much. In fact, all you often need is a vision, dedication, and a hell of a lot of luck.
