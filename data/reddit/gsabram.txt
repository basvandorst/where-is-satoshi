The thing is that cryptoassets are neither true currencies, commodities, or true capital investments.  They have properties of all three fall on a spectrum with all three.
You argue that someone can create a new cryptocurrency like bitcoin, but with slightly different parameters, and that's true.  But the value from bitcoin doesn't MERELY come from the code itself.  It comes from the fact that it's already become an accepted store of value by millions of people.  You can try convincing people that your new currency is better, and the principles of economics will apply to which one outcompetes, but BTC will have first market advantage.  Another cryptocurrency is going to have to innovate and find other uses for the technology to overtake Bitcoin.  And that's exactly what altcoin projects are trying to do - they see value in the technology, *and flaws* in the technology.  And they're working to innovate and improve on something that is already seen by many as a successful innovation on our current monetary system.
Now, it seems like you PERSONALLY, don't see the innovations of a decentralized public ledger attached to a currency as anything significant.  That's your evaluation of it and that's fine. People like you have existed since long before bitcoin, before cellphones, before the dotcom bubble, before the I.C.E. replaced horse and carriage.  No skin off the rest of our backs.

That's not how evolution works... All families of Ornithischia and the vast majority of families in Saurischia  went extinct in the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event.  The very few species that survived were lucky enough that they happened to be adapted to staying alive on a drastically changing planet.
The analogous question being posed is:  When a cryptocurrency extinction-level event occurs (i.e. breakthroughs in quantum computing, breakdown of the fiat banking system, or something else unpredictable that would cause FUD) will Bitcoin be adapted to overcome the disaster or not?  The direction that BTC has adapted as the blockchain has become more congested may determine whether it will survive or not... or it may have nothing to do with whether it will survive or not.

Sure.  You're grounding your well being on that social contract.  So am I - I pay my taxes too.  The bitcoin/crypto communities are just hedging some non-zero percentage of our resources that a new form of social contract will be useful in the future. 
And I fully admit that in the year 2017, that hedge was pure speculation.  At this point in 2018 it remains so.  But will it remain purely speculative in 2025?  I think the technology will find some usefulness by then.  And if the one's I bet one turn out to be half as useful as Amazon.com is today, then my family and I will not have to worry about income for a long time.

Indeed, like all stores of value.  Scarcity itself can only make 3 things valuable - food, water, and air.
@_date: 2018-01-17 04:54:51
That's is indeed one way to look at it.  The way I see it, USD does have value for the reasons you tell yourself, but those reasons are grounded in a consensus perception.  The perceptions I refer to are the existence of social contracts, like the U.S. government, and tax laws.  You live your life like these are real tangible things that exist because that's what we've are taught and thinking like this allows us to understand the rules of society more simply.  In reality they are complex social contracts between each individual and the individuals that live in the approximate vicinity.  They have evolved over hundreds of years to the point that it's easier to believe they exist OUTSIDE of people that that they merely exist INSIDE our collective consciousnesses.  
You can try to imagine what it would look like to a being coming across what we call a "society" for the first time: 350million+ Americans have reached a formal agreement about a whole set of social rules (laws), the rulemaking process (government), the process for remaking the rulemaking process (constitutions), etc.  To the point that we agree to collectively hire various sets of people (militaries, police) to enforce these sets of rules with the threat of violence.  Sure it centralizes power in certain people.  Sure it is self-reinforcing through economics and education systems.  But it's not something that exists outside of human perception and consensus.
Understanding the ways we interact with one another on a basic and theoretical level is start for the idea that we can create perceived systems of consensus that operate on a principle of keeping power and/or resources *decentralized*
@_date: 2018-01-17 05:23:08
Most things hold value because of *perceived* scarcity, not actual scarcity.  We are told the value of something by others who are part of our social contract.  Since we live by the rules of the contract and act under them, we assume the rules and values that we're told hold true.  You don't buy gold bullion at $1300 an ounce because it's already cost you $1300 to mine an ounce of gold, you buy it at that price because others have told you that's what it *would* cost at the scales it's currently being mined and you believe them because you understand how markets work.  The only things that derive value from actual scarcity are the things that you continuously require in order to continue existing (food, water, etc.)
@_date: 2018-01-17 04:00:31
Analogous to saying, "They tell me gold is scarce but the abundance of other valuable metals like silver, copper, etc. makes it clear there is nothing scarce about it."
Yes, gold is a metal.  Yes so is silver.  Yes copper is a metal and even has a similar coloration.  To someone who hasn't actually learned about metals in general and or looked closely at the different properties that make them useful in different situations, they all seem abundant and more or less the same.

You seriously can't think of any advantages to a free decentralized public voting ledger?  
* Have you ever been able to verify that your specific vote was truly counted in an election?  I haven't.  Do you trust the poll workers in your neighborhood that much?
* Relatedly, something like this could potentially remove most (perceived or real) third party "human error" problems from the polling and voting process.  By human error I mean things like veiled racism by poll workers on one hand, and the *perception* of voter fraud on the other.
* People could potentially set and change their vote 24/7/365 dependent on current events and so on throughout the year.  With our current government polls could still close every election cycle for your final choice to be counted (i.e. all final vote dispositions, timestamped on or before 11:59PM on Tuesday are counted). passive voting would almost definitely boost voter participation.  This could even eventually lead to something closer to direct democracy.  
* "Buying" an election with money could potentially be more difficult if the citizenry can vote on their own time.  We could say goodbye to targeted attack ads through September and October.  Anyone who wants to buy an election will be forced to spend money constantly throughout the year.

That's not a fair analogy either though!  You want to play the analogy game here it is:  private keys are generated without assistance from a third party.  Every analog key you've ever used was handed to you by a locksmith or a property owner, who could easily have duplicates.  That's called *trust.*
Now, I'll agree with you 100% that trust relationships formed in the real world should be treated differently than trust relationships formed over the internet.  But if you form a trust relationship over the internet with a public bank, escrow, or bank-like business, you *have* real world practical avenues to relief that you DONT get if you try and fail to secure your private key on your own.
What is comes down to is this:  What is your skillset, and based on your skillset, what is the easiest way to recover your money at the end of the day?
For an IT professional or software engineer, it may well be they have an appropriate offline device on which to store private keys.  Most people don't have devices that are 100% hack-proof anymore, nor would they know where to look.  And anyone who actually puts a paper wallet on a scrap of paper just shouldn't even be involved in bitcoin.
So for a legal or business professional, for example, it's much easier to form a fiduciary relationship with a bank-like entity than to play around with hardware.  Lawyers and brokers understand the nuances or their contractual relationships with third parties like an IT professional understands the nuances of info security.  It's just easier for some people to secure and enforce a contract than to secure and protect a inconspicuous rolodex, and trust their own memory of their passwords or something.

Um, according to the IRS's recent ruling, no it isn't.   The IRS is treating bitcoins as a property, similar to stock or real estate.  That 10,000 BTC does not count as wages (income), consideration for goods/services (sales/revenue), or appreciation in value (capital gains).  It's essentially a contingent gift of property, like a deed of land subject to a contingency.   Since you're not asking for any tangible personal benefit in return for the award, it's probably only taxable as a gift, meaning the donor (OP) is responsible for paying taxes, not the beneficiary (whoever takes him up on the offer).
The next taxable event, once he receieves the BTC, occurs ONLY if he spends BTC at a higher value that they the amount they were at on the day he received them.  Then it would be subject to your short- or long-term capital gains dependant on how long he's been in possession of them.

That isn't how it would (even theoretically) work.  Money is only a placeholder for actual wealth accumulated.

Your basic assumption is incorrect.  Legal tender issued by the government is a special type of property.  It's not the same as a personal asset or real estate (and even those have regulations surrounding what you're allowed to do with them; there are tons of restrictions on all sorts of privately owned property, from buildings to guns to various chemicals, so I'm not sure you've thought through the implications of your question: "How can it be illegal to do what you want with your own [property].")  
Long story short, U.S. dollars are really just "federal reserve notes," meaning they're nothing more than banknotes which are issued by the federal reserve and backed by the US government (banknotes used to be backed by actual gold in fort knox but that ended a long time ago, now they're just backed by the government's promise that it currently holds assets which will eventually equal the value of all currency issued).  The federal reserve prints the currency and distributes it all as collateral against the promise of government assets, very similar to the promise that a check issued to you can be cashed into your bank account to add a debit to your own account.  This is why it's so worrisome when the U.S. government raises it's own debt ceiling (the total amount the government has authorized itself to be "in the red"), and why it's even more worrisome when the credit rating of the U.S. government takes a downgrade.

Let's think it through.  Say you borrow $1000 USD (say a personal loan at 10%) to short in exchange for 1.15 BTC.  Let's use a commodity as a control asset, for perspective: gas is ~ $3/gal, so $1000 can buy you 333.33 gallons.
Within a year the dollar crashes, hyperinflation strikes, prices go up an order of magnitude.   1.15BTC now costs 10,000 (and so does  333.33 gallons of gasoline.)  You then can pay back the loan by converting .127 BTC to $1,100.  
Year end, you've netted 1.03 BTC worth at least $9000 USD (still worth ~ 333.33 gallons of gas).  Assuming this is taxed as capital gains, you will technically owe the IRS taxes on the wealth you've realized (the $1100 you've converted to pay back outstanding debts was "realized"), because they view the dollar as constant and everything else as appreciating massively.  
Assuming BTC is taxed as a capital asset you won't owe anything for the 1.03 BTC you continue to hold, until you use it for goods/services.  If the dollar remains over-inflated, then the FMV of goods/ services is an order of magnitude higher than it is today.

It very likely does *not* indicate the masses are devaluing the currency irrationally.  The simplest explanation is that a few holders of a large quantity are buying fiat, either for the purpose of making a large purchase, paying off a debt, getting ready for Chinese New Year (or US Tax Day although that's admittedly a while off), or investing in something else.  When the price moves downward due to a "dump" like this, BTC slowly becomes more evenly distributed amongst the market (moving from few participants holding many coins mined earlier, to many participants holding a few coins bought recently).

Call me crazy, but I think that apple will directly incorporate bitcoin as an option analogous to gift cards in their proprietary wallet.

First of all, I don't think Apple necessarily needs a cut of each transaction in order to profit from this type of payments technology.  They easily profit from customer acquisition of the POS technology itself. (The customer being the retail store that buys the tech to direct iPhone payments).
Second, if it wanted to, Apple could insert itself between the customer and retailer in a similar way that Coinbase and Bitpay currently do.  The advantages they have include the added value to all parties through whatever proprietary features their POS has, and, to retailers, an established customer base who will buy compatible iPhone without question.
In fact, if apple *invests* any percentage of their networth in BTC (say, .001%: thats 4.5 million, lets assume anonymous buys at regular intervals over the course of a year), and they later promote BTC to the point it's as common as an iPhone is, they would potentially profit through capital gains more than any other capital asset investment.

Do you think that government "creates" gangs in an analogous way to the government "creating" black markets?  Because i think your looking at it from the wrong perspective.  The government doesn't *create* either gangs or black markets and it can't be held *responsible* for their direct existence.*  The government has merely *labeled* the situation and activities of the group as illegal, writing an organization into the definition of a "gang".  Similarly the black market exists, with or without a government, it's just not *called* a "black market" until the government starts taxing or banning things.
The gangs themselves, and the black markets themselves, are emergent institutions based on internal identity (culture, community etc.)   Without government they'd be "factions" or "clans" but they'd be agreeing to commit the same sorts of activities.
^* Thats not to say government actions won't *influence* gangs but blame for influencing an existing gang and blame for causing a gang to exist have to be distinct.

Thats not how markets work.  For instance we've seen some steep falls with relatively small volume.  But then even if volume picked up some time later, that doesn't necessarily mean the price moves back up proportionally.  Rather, current price is a function of the last sale price and the *ratio* of current prospective buyers to sellers (also their asks/bids) at any given moment.  The vast majority of wallets don't even see movement between the multiple wallets of a single actor, let alone a bone fide purchase order to another person.

I don't understand why ANYONE is using bitcoin unless they already understand that every one of their transactions is already public and traceable, regardless of if you use a tumbler, regardless of how many addresses you use.
Yes, tumbling makes tracing marginally more difficult for the powers that would bother tracing you in the first place.  And a permanent withdrawal addresses make tracing marginally easier.  But it's already doable for anyone with an understanding of it, regardless of what extra steps you take.  
So it isn't a question of whether this feature makes an untraceable bitcoiner suddenly *traceable.*  You were already traceable, whether you wanted to believe it or not.  The question is whether it makes tracing you *so much easier* that suddenly a new set of people will have access to your history that didn't have it before.

I challenge you to describe a financial system that *does not* involve creating broad one-size-fits-all rules.  
As far as the third-party-trust systems we've had up to the internet, we could not have a financial system without these types of rule unless each person negotiated literally every clause of every contract they signed.  In fact, hell, what do you think people are talking about when they describe bitcoin as a **protocol.**  Sure, BTC isn't run by a corporation or government, but it's still based on creating a system of one-size-fits-all rules based on the needs of the parties involved.  And just like any banking contract can be negotiated by a party who feels a need to break from the boilerplate, bitcoin's rules can be customized by parties assenting to an adjustment of the transaction's rules.
It's a nice sounding statement for fairy tale anarcho-capitalist idealism, but in the real world, contracts are enforced by predictable and agreed upon rules.

In re: The final paragraph of the final FAQ:


Actually the US government's current approach is is better described as: "We don't want rush in and reclassify something that is probably already covered by existing laws and regulations."  The biggest regulatory question for *this* year is "What will the IRS classify bitcoin as?"
There are a few scenarios in *coming years* which might cause the U.S. government to actually start regulating virtual currencies separate from other types of securities:
* Regardless of if they say something by April, the IRS will carefully study how known BTC investors, businesses, and miners report their taxes this year.  If they believe people will use BTC to avoid paying taxes you can expect regulators to look for ways to map and tag the blockchain.
*  If / when the dollar crashes, if it happens before bitcoin has reached a certain critical mass of users or if it is exacerbated by bitcoin, you can expect measures to be taken directly against bitcoin.  There's no way to know how the federal government could actually get at bitcoin, but considering the resources at the government's disposal, noone should consider bitcoin untouchable.
* If viruses or wallet hacking become problems, expect expansions of existing crimes new criminal laws to deter this.
* Less likely in the short-term, but (imho) likely in the long-term:  Small governments at first, and eventually the EU and/or the US, will begin their own virtual currency analogs to compete with BTC et al.  This would allow governments to easily streamline and program their internal financial structure, and if done correctly, (it would help if governments could find a way to break the corruption cycle), it gives these obsolete institutions a chance to reclaim trust by allowing people to directly participate in their government in new ways.  I think there is real potential for a paradigm shift in the way redistribution of wealth actually occurs.
* If a killer exploit is found that makes bitcoin useless, expect the federal government to do literally nothing for anyone who loses anything whatsoever.  Your consolation prize will be tax deductions on future capital gains (assuming bitcoin can be declared a capital loss).

Anyone who doesn't understand how Apple and Google EACH profit from use of BOTH Android and iOS should go take a few economics and marketing classes.
Apple and Google are not competitors, even if the user base fanboy idiots want to believe they are.  In fact, they complement each other excellently, evidenced by the failure of the Windows Mobile OS.  Android exists as the mass market Volkswagen to iOS's Porsche:  Extremely customizable, available in many skins, and affordable to everyone in the marketplace.  This makes iOS a "luxury product" that makes Apple users feel special, despite the much fewer options available; Apple then gets to boost the price of their hardware because iOS is such an effective loss-leader.  Meanwhile, Google profits on BOTH operating systems so long as no one's chooses Bing as a default browser.  The only direct benefit Google gets from Android is brand credibility.

My point is a practical one, not a theoretical one.  And maybe I don't understand the underpinning mechanics enough... But it just seems like the ability to actually prove first ownership through the blockchain is just as expensive as doing it off the blockchain.  The only difference between the blockchain and the county recorders office is that a court HAS to believe the country recorder's office, but it doesn't HAVE to believe the blockchain.  Problems that exist under both scenarios:
* You can only prove the point in time of the purported original, you cannot force a timestamp on the purported infringer.  In this way a copyright troll can make a verifyable blockchain version of content prior to any other official recording to take advantage.
* You still have the issue of whether an altered work is stolen or a derivative/parody/"fair use" of the other.
* As a practical matter it will be more expensive to convince a court about the infallibility of the blockchain than to convince a job of the timestamp given by the Copyright office.
Maybe the blockchain will one day be fully embraced as an evidentiary tool by law, but until then the only huge advantage I'm seeing is decentralized public access.  Even that seems burdensome considering the potential mountain of data to sift through.

Best guess from a non-lawyer, non-accountant law student:  If I were you I'd do my best to determine the fair market value of each newly acquired asset on the date you acquired it.  If you exchange 1 BTC for 1 Class A share, and Class A can *only be* purchased with BTC then go with the FMV of BTC when you purchased.  Same with dividends, calculate the FMV of the BTC when received.
If Class A can be purchased with USD *or* BTC you could perhaps use the FMV of the share by finding out the purchase price in USD when you acquired the share.  But obviously it's unclear if that's correct.

To begin to answer your questions I may have to go into other topics so I apologize.


This first requires a discussion about what you mean by violence.  I *don't* automatically subscribe to the notion that violence is always inherently wrong.  For instance, violence against our natural environment is, to an extent, necessary for survival (building shelter, hunting or farming, burning fuel).  Self-defense to protect an innocent from an attack:  I would consider this an act of violence with a ethically positive outcome.  (As you can see, I happen to lean soft utilitarian when it comes to preservation of life.)  For this reason I **do not** consider laws (a.k.a. the threat of violence) automatically unethical.  If a community agrees on a law which threatens violence in order to prevent *more* violence, and the law is successful, then it is an ethically justified law in my view. (I guess in terms of your disease analogy, I believe the function of white blood cells [and to some extent chemotherapy] are justifiable.)
Now, don't get me wrong - the US govt. and state govts. do (and pretty much have always) abused the authority they're given to make laws.  But it's absolutely naïve, in my view, to say "our current government operates as a mafia, therefore we remove the mafia by removing the government."
There will always be communities (built on trust) competing against other distant (and therefore untrusted) communities for scarce resources on this planet.  We know that the communities that survive will inevitably grow and evolve, into gangs of *some* form, regardless of if they name their leaders chieftains, kings, politicians, or whathaveyou.  Without the rule of law (threat of violence) we are literally taking part in the game of natural selection every hour of every day until we die.  If we're not isolated in the wilderness, then we're forced to subscribe to the rules set by our community, or else change the rules somehow (probably through violence).  Most gangs don't let the members have *any* say in the rules.  When we agree to agree on rules, compromise where necessary, and enforce consequences (again, only enforceable against a rulebreaker through the threat of violence), a community of people living with a degree of trust in the system they relate through can achieve more than *merely* basic survival. 
The predictable objection will be "But I didn't ever agree to these rules."  And you're completely right.  And our current system is pretty shitty because the way it's set up, the rules are written before we're born, and last long after we die.  The internet and decentralized protocols like BTC will soon make these problems avoidable (if society were to consent to some changes), but anyways, I digress.
I will get to your second and third questions later, I have class in a bit.
@_date: 2014-01-05 09:19:30
99% of people *don't realize* they care.  They're all asking why bitcoin should be worth $1000 instead of $10 or $1.  They care about how bitcoin could have more value than dollars and cents, and the openness of the protocol without needing trust is the starting basis of that potential value.
As for  the public private dichotomy should be very apparent, i.e. "Bitcoin can be stored virtually anonymously, yet every transaction is a matter of public record on the blockchain."
@_date: 2014-01-21 07:53:28
Another problem is that, so long as bitcoin's cryptography remains secure and not backwards compatible, all a plaigarizer need do is alter a single punctuation mark in the content to output an unmatched hash, which means that older files have a proportional risk of being undiscovered on the blockchain.

To *presume* the CEO's masturbation situation means lost profits is purely speculation.  The stock price typically drops the moment the news hits the print.   Yet at that point, there's usually no guarantee of an indictment, let alone a conviction (and even then, no reason to think it would mean jail time.)  But hopefully you're reasonable, you can acknowledge that the masturbation news *would almost certainly* cause an immediate drop in price, regardless of what it would mean, as a practical matter, for the company.  The simplest explanation is that stockholders no longer trust the profitability when they've learned new information about the CEO.  But shareholders can't know *why* the company is now less profitable, because they can't tell the future.  It may be because a good CEO will go to jail.  It may be because shareholders now decide he's a bad CEO that they want the BoD to fire, but to do so and hire a better CEO would be expensive and involve litigation.  Shareholders tell themselves narratives about the future that they presume will result and buy/sell accordingly. 
**TL: DR, The point is that stock price incorporates future expectations (uncertainty), in addition to evaluating past/present performance.**
Now bringing it back to Overstock: Overstock's price dipped because (as you mentioned) shareholders' realized today that the Q4 earnings were largely due to deferred tax benefits.  Thus, the shareholders have acknowledged that the price valuation last week (when Q4 earnings were reported) was artificially overvalued - on that day they believed Overstock was behaving more profitably than it actually had been; so today they've adjusted their expectations about the future.

Word your assertions carefully, because, while what you've said sounds all well and libertarian, using  language like "inherently evil," and "based upon the *premise* of initiating force," you're taking the typical assertion of government overreach to an extreme that no reasonable person would fight to back up face to face, in public.

Tell me that what has changed in these individuals' minds, philosophy, actions, though process over the past 10 years.  The people now labeled as "Tea Party" have always been here, always been crazy, and have always been willing to shoot you for violating what they view as 1st person, absolute, individual rights.  The only thing that prompted this group of people to get a label for themselves was that a black guy got elected.  
Now they have a label.  Great.  They're still the same selfish cowards who hide behind a threat of violence to solve what they perceive as their own problems.  They still firmly believe that anyone who disagrees can go fuck themselves.  Unfortunately for them, their rallies spiked in 2009-2011, and are now back down to pre-Obama levels (the only difference being the more recognizable label).  They won't ever be an organized movement or revolution, because they refuse to centralize and organize *on principle.*

Technically stock options are always "worth" something because a stock option is, by definition, a discount on the market price of stock.  So whatever the stock is selling at, the value of your *option* is the difference between market price and the price *you* pay.
Of course, the catch-22, as with everything else in economics, an option is only valuable at the moment you utilize it.

First let me say I am not a financial advisor nor a lawyer:
But from my limited financial/legal training, it looks like they're setting this up this as an investment fund for the purpose of trading bitcoin, the same way that a Gold-based ETF would trade on the gold market.
Some advantages:  It means that senior citizens (and their 401ks) can easily invest in the value of bitcoin without actually BUYING their own bitcoins (or even a computer).  To *that end* its more accessible, and arguably more secure than a personal investment because in the even of a problem the company might have more assets than JUST bitcoins, and shareholders may have a better exit strategy if bitcoin crashes.  They might also have a potentially derivative lawsuit against the Trustee/Sponsor/Directors, if the Winklevoss or other directors start breaching their fiduciary duties to the trust.
On the other hand, if you're investing in bitcoins but you don't own a computer, you probably don't know enough about them to safely hold any sort of investment in them.  Further, the value of your investment is inescapably tied to the fiat you used to buy *stock in the trust.*  Instead of investing in bitcoin, you're essentially investing in *the Winklevoss twins ability to manage a bitcoin investment firm.*  Lastly, each person who buys their own bitcoin autmatically increases the trade-volume of bitcoin; but your investment in the trust doesn't guarantee that your money will ever be spent on bitcoin (in fact, the FIRST listed duty of the trustee is to compensate Trust sponsor BEFORE investing in bitcoins.  The sponser is named as "Math-Based Asset Services LLC," which is also owned by the Winklevoss twins.)

Ahh, that would definitely change things... slightly.  
But it doesn't change where the blame ends up.  If MtGox promised you (I presumer you're an early user) that they wouldn't sell your information, and then they signed a contract which effectively sold the rights to all their North American customers' information, then they really breached TWO agreements:  they breached their guarantee not to sell your info as an early user by contracting out your info to Coinlab, and then they breached the contract of sale, attempting to "substantially comply with" their agreement with the early users (this is a way to defend a potential lawsuit from the early users).

Your title makes a simple assertion of a fact: Economists are of the opinion that the creator or creators of bitcoin should get a Nobel Prize in economics.  The article doesn't quote an economist stating that opinion.  Not even the article itself states anything even close to that opinion (in which case you could at least *argue* the author is an economist.)  
The subject of this article is not the anecdotal introduction.  It's plain from the title and the thesis.  "In this post I’ll talk about the implementation of the Bitcoin fiat-money and a challenge facing the emergence of  anonymous markets for real goods and services."

I think you're confusing a necessary condition for a sufficient one.  
The idea being proposed is that we will need regulation to guarantee consumer safety, widespread adoption, and success in the long run, but that doesn't make regulation guarantees success.  And even further, the specific *nature* of regulation matters; for instance exchanges complying with certain SEC trading standards to allow market stability and some uniformity in procedures.
@_date: 2013-10-30 02:57:01
Thats a very large part of it.  But it's different than actually buying bitcoin directly, because YOU don't own the BTC, you own stock in the business that *trades* BTC.  Just like a person with Exxon stock doesn't own any barrels of crude, but owns AN INTEREST in Exxon's crude. 
By way of example, imagine a few scenarios:
You exchange your fiat for bitcoin, I invest in the Winklevoss Trust.  
1.  If BTC crashes, I still have the possibility of recouping some of my initial investment in the *business.*  The winklevoss trust probably holds SOME assets other than BTC; probably at least a building, valuable trading equipment, and probably fiat currency on reserve.
2.  If the Winklvoss twins do something idiotic and get on the news, the price of my stock may plummet regardless of whether BTC is on the way up or down.  This could be a good or bad thing for me; it's bad if I was planning to sell in the near future, but if I'm holding long-term, then I can now buy MORE stock in the business for a deflated price.  (In that case, I'm betting that public opinion will shift before I'm ready to sell.)
3.  What happens if your home *fiat* crashes.  Well, you're in the best position because you're holding your OWN BTC to spend.  Everyone else is kinda fucked EXCEPT:  Now stock in the Winklevoss trust is pretty valuable; even if the fiat price drops, it's actual value still going to be better than other fiat-for-stock investments.  In all likelyhood, the shareholders would attempt to hold a vote so that shareholders can now buy stock with BTC and recieve dividends in BTC (if we aren't already.)
By the way, I'm basically treating the trust as a corporation even though it would technically operate in some significantly different ways.  The reason I'm doing that is because we don't know anything about the stucture of the business itself (Corporation, Partnership, LLC, LP, LLP, LLLP, etc.)

Anyways I don't think anyone's saying 100k next year or even in in three years.  JUST remember:  1BTC = $100k relates the values of TWO units of exchange.  You're not just betting that BTC won't continue to slope up.  You're also betting that the dollar won't continue to inflate.

Because (a) you're not necessarily going to see more profit.  It will be more common in the beginning but if it becomes popular, you'll eventually see more competitive prices.
and (b) what consumer friendly safety features are you losing by switching to bitcoin?  If it's fraud protection, bitcoin will overcome the isolated security concerns that exist.  And the fraud protection model of credit cards require you give your money to a second businesses, whose profit model is based solely on fees and overages.  It's an obvious trade off.

Nothing advocated by minarchists and anarchocapitalists has anything to do with removing force from the equation.  Their minions on reddit often purport this, attempting to attract similar-minded redditors like you and me, but every *solution*, *"alternative"* to basic government functions advocated by **Molyneux**, **Friedman**, etc. ultimatles uses the same monopoly of force that current governments have, merely *privatized* so that only shareholders in those institutions control them.  For instance, insurance companies to redistribute wealth, some sort of "quasi-court" system to make sure that free markets can still exist (be it enforceable arbitration of contracts or some other judicial system), and local councils to decide how to put public assets to best use.
Can you imagine a system of privatized city councils and privatized courts really working out for the little guy when it comes to even the simplest bread and butter of our government?  Enforcing a disputed contract?  Compensating a person harmed by another's negligence?  Preventing people from taking up arms against their neighbors?  
Because I can't.  I completely agree with all those dudes when it comes to what is *broken* about our system, but their fix ignores the underlying cause.  It isn't the institutions that are broken.  It's the incentives for the people IN our system that are the underlying cause of dysfunction.  Abolishing "so-called government" and replacing it with corpro-government redux doesn't change the incentives of people who wear suits to make money by shaping the rules, procedures, and risk to best favor themselves.

I get that you have reservations about your Yubikey being taken by another party, but your reservations just seem SO misdirected.
You blame this all on Coinlab, and you framed the lawsuit as Coinlab "bullying" MtGox into handing over Yubikeys.  The fact of the matter is, IF the alleged contract exists, MtGox voluntarily entered it because they saw it helping their bottom line.
You entrusted your bitcoin security to MtGox, and they [allegedly] broke your trust by licensing it out to Coinlab.  Can they do that?  It depends on the terms of service of course; and I'm willing to bet my bitcoin wallet that MtGox's terms of service specifically allow them to license out your data to third parties.
If I were you, I'd be pissed at MtGox for even putting you in this position as a user in the first place.  If Coinlab was acting illegally, i.e. hacking MtGox's secure data, that would be something to be pissed at Coinlab for.  But this case is different because MtGox [allegedly] CHOSE to defer all dealings with you and other NorthAmerican customers through Coinlab.  
From this angle, MtGox is actually the bully:  they bargained away your rights for financial benefit, reneged on that bargain for financial benefit, and are now framing the ordeal as, "Dear Faithful Userbase, Coinlab wants to insert itself into our business relationship.  We didn't know it when we signed on the dotted line.  We just want to protect your satoshis."
It seems the only reason you're angry with Coinlab is that they happen to be in the US, subjecting them to US jurisdiction.  At the same time, their location was the primary reason this deal occurred in the first place!  MtGox should have known about the security and jurisdiction issues when entering this agreement.
If I were in your shoes, I wouldn't wait to find out if Coinlab wins the case before cancelling that account.

"Whatever the fuck that means" is precisely the reason that they backed away from the trade, so to disregard what 'high risk' means is to be totally ignorant of why the trade failed.  It could well mean that their trading system detected a certain threshold of volatility in the exchange rate and automatically responded to save OP from a probable loss.  In that case then bitcoin would not 'suck' based on this trade; you could always introduce other evidence that they suck, but without something aside from this possibly justified filtering no reason to imply otherwise.

That's not how it works.  In order to purchase $1mil there MUST *FIRST* be $1mil worth of asks from various people looking to sell on an exchange.  And if another buyer is offering a higher bid then they will get matched instead of you.  Thus you have to bid more per BTC than the average bidder on the market to drive the price up.  Thus, you've bought $1mil BTC, paying more per BTC than anyone else was willing to on the market.
But let's assume you *could* ramp up the price a few hundred USD per BTC by moving big money around.  Okay, now the price has just bounced up to the level that we were at a few days ago with the ramp up.  Now you're ready to turn around and sell, but here's the catch-22: every buyer in the market immediately after you drove the price up is bidding at a lower rate than you were at when you bought your $1mil of BTC.  So you have to wait for (a) those people to suddenly decide to bid higher than you did or (b) a whole new group of buyers to enter the market at the exchange rate you set.  Good luck with either.

How does it lose value by becoming too popular though?  Usually this happens with *commodities* when the market has been over flooded with supply as demand levels off, but the rate of bitcoin is more or less predetermined at any given point into the future.  Unless demand actually DECREASES, the purchasing power shouldn't drop because supply is fixed.

The thing is, like all the other examples mentioned, bitcoin of course has a barrier to entry, but it takes about an evening for a computer literate college grad to understand the basics of using bitcoin and maybe one more evening to understand how to set up a secure wallet, if you're slow.  That's as big a barrier to entry as facebook or general social networking once had.  The thing about these barriers to entry, they're one way for the vast majority of people, because once you've spent that day or two, you immediately start to accumulate a value that outweighs the time spent.  If you have the patience to try it and do it right, it's likely to be a windfall.

Most people know that something which is "virtual" is a simulation which exists as part of a theory, separate from the observable, practical world.  
Everyone also knows "digital" as a the polar opposite of analog; and most would probably say that while both can exist in the real world, one is based on electronics while one is based on mechanics.

Pretty sure they can't.  That would potentially open them up to liability.

More like watching everyone else tend to their money tree saplings, but not having any idea what season they were planted it in.  Some people have green thumbs, some are not so lucky, the inquisitive ones will figure it out along the way, and the hungry ones will cut it down before the fruit even ripens, or before the inevitable fiat famine.
But the reason people try planting now is on the off chance their kids might someday live off an orchard.

If you hit the button and it doesn't send through it's because the number has refreshed.  Always double check and understand how the posted number refreshes with price fluctuations.

That's  not the question.  The question is, what will the government do if you do not convert your bitcoin back into dollars.  Will the government exert its authority to tax in bitcoin, a person's totally private property, never loaned out by any government?

Inherent value often differs from negotiated value aka sale price.  Audio CD's have the same inherent value they've always had, a physical store of music; but because of a less costly alternative in mp3s, the lack of demand pulls the price down on them.

Whoopdee fucking doo.  Your hate of all things apple stems from your inability to block ads and install the apps you want, etc.  But if you know what you're getting when you buy an apple product, then somehow, you don't discover you hate it.
It's ironic that android users name-call apple users as pretentious, when it's practically the opposite.  Back when the iPhone first came out, sure the apple-fappers were pretentious as fuck.  Compared to people with regular cell phone capabilities, back in 2007.  Today, it's the fandroids who are ultra picky about the limitations apple *dare* to impose on THEIR property.  Normal smartphone functions just aren't enough; they need MORE.
Phones are more than mere personal property.  They're a telephone (and now internet) service.  You hate apple because the service they provide is more limited than you'd prefer.  It's about as rational as hating a gardener because he doesn't do relandscaping.

Every business owner knows this is simply not true.  If there is market demand among current customers that your business provide a new service, you provide the service or face the long term consequences.
Especially for a company like Apple, they will easily be able to learn how many of their current users want bitcoin wallets on their phones from a petition.  If they want to prevent people from switching before the next generation of purchases, they will.

As the value increases in magnitude, volatility increases in magnitude, until the market saturates.

Really?  Every article I've read compares bitcoin's deflationary nature to the spiraling inflation of fiat currencies.  Everyone says that freely printing fiat currency lessens each dollar's purchasing power (even if we favor the value of cash on hand), but that the limit on bitcoins means that the value will increase so long as it has some perceived value or utility to offer.

There's a very short window to request it, and they ask you to submit a reason.  I think it's less than 3 minutes.  You can check the support page.

Two things:  One, of course, worthless stock is worthless.  But don't conflate the option with the stock itself.  If we both purchase the same stock at the same moment, you pay market price, and I pay the option price; and THEN the stock crashes days after, my option was indeed WORTH something even though the stock wasn't.  I netted less of a loss in the investment than you did, solely due to my option.
Now of course, if you would have never purchased without the option, then you now have less in your pocket.  But people generally don't invest in something solely because they got a discount.  They also usually believe it will make money.

Which Android phone do **you** specifically have?  
EDIT:  You cannot use your fingerprint pattern to unlock your phone (without some cop-out like add on hardware, I'd consider that analogous to me saying "use iMessage").
BONUS:  Did *your phone* come equipped with HDR imaging?  That's probably another thing my phone does that yours cannot.
Thanks very much for your generosity, please deliver here, assuming you're a man/woman of your word:

You bring up a good point.  I'm wondering if it's arguable that enforcing a contract clause like that would amount to an anti-trust violation, but I'm guessing it's more analogous to a non-compete clause.

Don't think of this behavior as buying into bitcoin at a low position.
Think of it as cashing out of fiat currency at fiat's high position.

It seems to me that the entire idea of Coinvalidation is against the public policy to protect bona fide purchasers of currency and fungible goods.  Whichever side of the line bitcoin falls on, it should be protected by plenty of legal precedent in the common law countries.
I mean, technically we could have always treated "dirty money" in this way.  We could have our police stamp dollar bills to track the dirty ones.  Why?  What possible benefit does that give to the public?  I'd much rather see asset seizures tracked and deducted from all of our taxes or something.  There's no benefit to removing value from bitcoin when law enforcement has already found ways to confiscate them, and anyone can repurpose them for legitimate business.

Regulations in the US will affect global adoption.  It won't *dictate* global adoption, but to ignore the US influence is just plain naïve
