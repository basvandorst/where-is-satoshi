After accessing the bitcoin market at the worst possible time my dollar cost average is through the roof... currently sitting at $900 a coin. My moon is just attaining these heights again so i can gain back some cash.

I mean no disrespect, just a curiousness. Something people could strive for. I respect your right to not answer. Goodluck in your future!

Thank you for these links! Its all very interesting and exciting. There doesn't appear to be a cost for listing items. My concern is stock control being i am for the moment rather a small time player. Managing stock between multiple sale points and a brick and mortar store.
 Thank you for your feedback!

Always happy to expand my holdings. May i ask why the generosity? 
@_date: 2014-07-16 10:42:47
What is your current holdings in bitcoins? What is your average weekly incoming/outgoing ?
@_date: 2014-07-14 06:51:24

I have been using a few faucets that pay me about $2.00 worth of coins a week. I know it isnt much but if you don't want to pay for them its a step in the right direction. Heres my list with/without Referrals.
Thats a handful of them to help you get started. Yes its a slow process,Yea the payouts are kinda slim. But it is for the moment the easiest way to get started earning without gambling.
Goodluck and happy earning!

Yeah sorry mate, mining now is a big guys game and it gets harder by the day to compete. My advice is to invest in the buying of more bitcoin/altcoin if you are thinking long term growth. 
@_date: 2017-10-12 07:52:41
I predict that this prediction will be wrong. As much as i wish it were true that is an insane amount of growth in such a short time. Unsustainable for the moment.

Hey great idea!! 
@_date: 2016-07-09 09:03:23
Whether we are to the moon or we crash in 8 hours time. I know one thing, i will HODL!!

I currently have two AMD radeon 6700's On my home computer. Not the most tech savvy person and it is starting to age.
 
 When maxing out my cards i draw around the 400 mh/s. 
Im now looking at USB miners that are 335 mh/s and run at 2.5 watts...still trying to do the math on that though. A USB wont make the computer run hotter thus more cooling power. Or is that a foolish assumption?
@_date: 2013-09-11 21:34:45
Thank you all for the feedback. I will go grab a power meter and just do a few tests. Guess its the only way to be certain.
@_date: 2013-12-31 23:59:11
While that would be awesome. I just dont see it happening for a long time.

backup on external hard drive... stolen also. Just a run of badluck i guess.

I like the idea of Steam accepting bitcoins. This is a logical first step,using internet based companies while a few more of the kinks are worked out for general in over the counter transactions. Most people arent educated just yet in Bitcoins. 
 Its important to build a foundation of operations while the general population is becomming more and more educated.

Wouldnt that be awesome. Bitcoin funding the colonization of Mars,or any other planet. Since the funding continues to get cut for NASA i wonder if the community banded together and donated in bitcoin would we be able to kickstart our interplanetary exploration and developement. 
 Imagine a whole new planet using bitcoin.

This is pretty handy. 
 Any chance you could add an AUD version? 
 Also the ability to scroll backward to see any trends?
 
Good job creating it!
