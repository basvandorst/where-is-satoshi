I think as a community it's time we started work on some confederated, open standards detailing how exchanges and such should manage our money.
@_date: 2011-07-23 00:26:17
Why is that? The USD isn't propped up with anything real. And it is far from genuine.

I asked for verification when I first saw this thread a couple of hours ago. No response. This person is obviously trying to steal money. I'm guess I'm not surprised at the fact that a few people pledged money, given the blind zealotry that drives most voters.
@_date: 2011-07-21 11:25:04
This sound reasoning gets downvoted? Yes ...lets all give this person who can't spell the name of their alleged boss all of our money!
@_date: 2011-08-07 14:07:16
With that hardware you'd be lucky to make about $.30/day. (Per  with hardware and electricity 
You can decide based off of those figures if it's worth it.
@_date: 2011-08-03 15:47:16
I'll trade you one for $11.

I agree that we should be able to take a GPL-ish approach to any proposed standards that an exchange should choose to adopt. There has to be a level of transparency involved in this as well, i.e., what type of storage does the wallet.dat exist in.
If we're to trust individuals with our money than it's up to us to make the rules with regards to how that money is managed. 
I propose that we implement a consortium of users from the community who will exist to determine compliance by any given exchange that chooses to adopt the standards.

What are trade walls, if you don't mind me asking?

Just a bug: 
@_date: 2011-07-21 12:02:23
I emailed this person claiming to be Tracee over an hour ago looking for some sort of verification. I have yet to receive a response.
FUCK OFF SCAMMERS.
@_date: 2011-07-21 12:04:42
FUCK OFF SCAMMER.
@_date: 2011-09-06 13:44:45
Thanks for taking the time to explain this! I really appreciate it.
@_date: 2011-07-25 20:19:57
Hahaha. The troll force is weak with this one.
So says the guy who's last submission to r was this: 
@_date: 2011-08-06 16:04:50
What do you think will happen now that exchanges are allowing things like short-selling? Will it make it attractive to investors again in the short term?
@_date: 2011-07-21 11:24:01
I was joking, but in all seriousness this wreaks of a scam. I can't imagine a presidential candidate would risk accepting cryptocurrency as a form of donation. Every donation has to be strictly matched with a donor and the very nature of BTC makes this more challenging than it's probably worth. 
@_date: 2011-07-21 11:14:00
Great ...another presidential candidate that can't even spell their own name.
@_date: 2011-07-14 16:08:15
Just give him some cash to convert to btc.
@_date: 2011-07-11 18:48:28
Absolutely true! Doesn't sound like this guy has any of those things, though.
@_date: 2011-08-01 03:41:14
Not really. Banking systems are run by for-profit banks. 
This would be an open source implementation and enforced by community individuals. No centralized power or decisions made by anyone that could turn a profit.
@_date: 2011-07-26 23:04:24
I see. Thanks you for that information.
Does it make sense that no one should support a closed-source client, which is what it sounds like this guy is trying to accomplish?
@_date: 2011-07-14 16:05:51
It seems to me that bitcoins are only slightly easier to launder than physical currencies. 
@_date: 2011-07-11 20:28:55
Awesome write-up. Thanks for sharing the info!
@_date: 2011-07-31 17:53:12
These incidents don't imply that BTC is any less valid as a currency, the same way theft of someone's USDs don't invalidate that currency. Your logic needs some tooling, my friend.
And what do politics have to do with this? Keep that nonsense in please. 
@_date: 2011-07-21 12:00:51
No response? Me neither. Huge surprise.
@_date: 2011-08-07 23:01:22
Bitcoin Hotcops?
@_date: 2011-08-01 06:18:54
Sorry but I'm not trying to defend anything. I see little evidence from your posts that you know anything about BTC. If you want to come into this subreddit and have rational discussion, that's excellent, but your comments lead me to believe that you just want to troll.
Not sure what you mean by the god comment. Maybe you're looking for r/atheism.
@_date: 2011-08-01 03:49:53
Of course, but I'm talking about standards that would be either adopted or not by the exchanges. The standards would be decided upon by, us, the people with the money. Since this currency is so reliant on trust, why would anyone put their money in an untrusted exchange? 
@_date: 2011-08-01 04:49:46
Allow me to direct you to the FAQ: 
@_date: 2011-07-23 00:44:52
I guess you could say that it's implicitly backed by oil, but that's kinda conjecture. The fact is the USD is backed, if by anything at all, by debt as a faculty of fractional reserve spending.
I'll take bitcoin anyday! At least it's open-source and backed by technicians ...not non problem solvers like politicians. :-)
@_date: 2011-07-11 16:26:04
People who think they can make easy money are the true dime a dozen. People like that are often unwilling to take advice from the people who have had to actually work to earn a living.
Good luck to this Vegetta guy but it seems pretty clear from the rest of his endeavors that he'll tread water for the next few years, slowly building his already over-inflated ego. Sigh ...next.
@_date: 2011-07-26 22:22:36
Why doesn't he just contribute to the open source client? Who would ever trust a non-open-source client?
@_date: 2011-08-06 15:38:24
Besides buying low and selling high? Do people think the demand won't increase?
@_date: 2011-07-21 11:29:31
Where is the downvote brigade coming from? Redditor's question the authenticity of a potential scammer asking for money and they get downvoted? We all want this currency to succeed but one clear way it will fail is if we give it all away to fraudulent assholes.
Hahaha in this thread: Libertards and scammers.

Anarchism, right wing? Do you even political spectrum, bro???
@_date: 2013-05-10 12:26:06
