Someone put in a market order instead of a limit order and is now rather upset, perhaps?

With logic like this, what could go wrong?

It consumes more energy because there are more computers mining it than other cryptos. The number of transactions on bitcoin is actually less than some other cryptos.

For that, I’d say Gemini.

You meant to use its not it's

I'm only trying to educate.

What about how badass you look when showing your friends and family your Dr. Evil money?

You meant "your"
@_date: 2017-08-13 19:13:01
Yes. It's is a contraction meaning it is. Its, on the other hand, is used to show ownership. So saying "its affect" is what you meant there, where the "massive world event" owns the affect. 
So their you go. Its.

Thanks, but I'm a native speaker. I know how English work's.

You could also end up day trading yourself to 0 bitcoin

You can buy in any amount you so desire.

Or..... the dev team can change the cap

I prefer paper wallets to the hardware wallets. Though I recently saw a post of someone stamping their wallet on sheet metal, which seems pretty nice, though a bit higher on the difficulty scale.

Gemini. Mostly because coinbase had issues with my ID and kraken requires like two weeks of jumping through hoops to fund in USD.

I think a raspberry pi that is never connected to the internet is a pretty good way to do it.

They pre-credit $500/day with a $15k monthly limit (with ACH). So, you can access $500 immediately. More than that and you'll need a wire transfer.

Doesn't using CC on coinbase have a pretty big fee?
@_date: 2017-10-26 19:54:23
Only $50k? Sounds like McAfee is going to be eating some dick.
