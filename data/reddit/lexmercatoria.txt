"Aren't you afraid Bitcoin is going to be hacked?"
That's the one that gets me every time.

Walmart is a bad company that hurts local economies, subsidizes it's labor through social government programs, and exploits workers overseas.
They have the lowest prices though, so I shop there twice a week. It would be shooting myself in the foot to pay a little more to stand up for something I believe in.

The best is when someone you helped get into crypto comes to you and you can have a discussion about the new coin they found and why they're interested in it. Pretty much exactly like you said - I have no problems teaching people, but I don't want to be responsible for their money.

In addition to having value because people will buy it, it has value because it has utility - Bitcoin is a different way to think about money.
* You can send Bitcoin to anyone with internet access without worrying about banks or borders in less time than the legacy banking system.
* You can store money with Bitcoin without worrying about physically storing or protecting gold or physical bills - you can even memorize a series of words so that your bitcoins can only be accessed by you, and you can do so anywhere in the world with an internet connection.
* Bitcoin is designed to be a deflationary system. Where as currencies like the dollar will lose value every year due to inflation, this doesn't happen with Bitcoin.

I don't even bother giving advice anymore. Instead I'll try to steer them toward learning about what Bitcoin actually is, how it works, and why we want it to work that way. The more they learn about crypto, the better decisions they can make for themselves about Bitcoin and altcoins. 
No one should be investing in this without at least a basic understanding of how all this works.

I think you missed the point.

Understand Bitcoin first. It came first for a reason. Learn about decentralization via nodes, the basics of the blockchain and mining, the economics - 21 million total supply and how it's distributed, and what all that allows us to do.
Then you can begin to understand the value of both new features to Bitcoin (Segwit, lightning, etc.) and altcoins for how they change the basics of Bitcoin, add new features, and/or focus on a specific use case.

Exactly this. I think a lot of people newer to Bitcoin are thinking of it like a game of musical chairs. Buy and take profits before the music stops. What these people and people from traditional finance do not/will no/can not realize is that many people who have been involved with Bitcoin from the beginning or early on (many of the devs, miners, and outspoken proponents) see it as a dynamic shift in the way the world will create and utilize financial networks. It's not a get rich quick scheme, it is the blueprints for each one of us to contribute to our own financial independence from banks, market manipulators, and heavy handed regulations.

It's actually not designed to be stable. Bitcoin is deflationary by nature, so as time goes on presumably two things happen. Adoption increases (which we're seeing) and coin minting decreases (current reward is ฿12.5 per 10 minutes. It was ฿50 when Bitcoin first started, and it halves every 4 years). That is in addition to lost coins being unrecoverable.
Deflation is one of the key design concepts of Bitcoin, which means that the value should continue to rise organically even without massively increasing adoption.

I agree, the price will stabilize and outgrow any dip or correction. After bitcoin reached a price of $1000 for the first time it corrected down to between $400-600 and stayed there for years toiling behind the scenes. There had been tons of media hype when the price broke $1k, but the hype was short lived. The same thing happened after bitcoin first hit $300, and when it first hit $30 before that, each with varying time frames.
This time around the media coverage, user base, and interested from traditional finance is much larger. The ecosystem is also much more evolved, so I don't anticipate Bitcoin falling into obscurity again (from a mainstream market point of view). But when the time comes that Bitcoin is no longer the front page story on every financial website, I anticipate a pull back. When that happens I'll wait it out just like I waited out every one before.
