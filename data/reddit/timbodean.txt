At first I defended this women because I felt bad that someone could be so naive and misguided, but no more. Demonizing the entire bitcoin community without expressing any fault in herself shows just how big this women's ego really is.

Fiat and bitcoin are completely different, whereas altcoins are essentially the same as bitcoin, so your analogy doesn't really refute my point. No reason to insult my opinion just because you misinterpreted it.

When people ask questions like "What role should the government play in Bitcoin?" they are completely missing the point of what Bitcoin is.

Thanks for the link, however I disagree that Cody Wilson misrepresented the incident. The guy doesn't even offer his condolences to her for what she has had to suffer through regarding her son. He skips right over who she is and takes the first opportunity he can to talk about ANYTHING else. At least address the situation with her son and what it represents for Bitcoin as a whole. Or, grow a pair of balls and admit her son has likely been targeted unfairly.

Well bully for you with your 4% cash back. Meanwhile the rest of us are getting screwed on the economic stagnation known as the legacy money transfer system. Why would you try to justify an obsolete service?

I'm inferring that the system is corrupt, and if you don't know that, it's probably because you have never been a victim of it. The game is rigged, and yes, affording a good lawyer can help.

People need to watch this. The anecdote about Ross Ulbricht's mother asking the CEO of Coinbase, at a conference in front of an audience, if her son deserves recognition for his contribution to the state of Bitcoin. The CEO is rendered speechless, torn between his own ideals and the wills of the state venture capitalists with whom he must answer to. If the CEO of the very company leading the way for Bitcoin is rendered impotent regarding such matters, the technology isn't going anywhere.

As a professional gambler I believe bitcoin to be one of the greatest "bets" of our time. If it fails, you lose 100% of your investment, or one betting unit. But if it succeeds, you can make a possible 100x your investment. If the chances if bitcoin succeeding is 1% or more, you are getting even money on your bet, but anyone who understands bitcoin knows its chances are better than that. Bet on bitcoin...

Good question. My lawyer said that we could go that route, but advised against it because it simply is not worth fucking with this corrupt system. These prosecutors are ruthless, you start throwing civil suits at them and you really piss them off.

I used to grow weed LEGALLY in California until the cops came and raided me for child endangerment, claiming the children who lived next store were being put in danger. This is what these people do, they launch a bunch of felony charges at you and only once it gets to court are the charges dropped because of lack of evidence. However, by that time the damage is already done, you've been jailed, payed lawyer fees, suffered mental anguish, and this is exactly what these prosecutors want. Makes me sick.

It would seem to make sense that number of transactions per day, difficulty level, and other factors would definitely correlated in some way to the price movement, revealing patterns. Obviously such predictions should be taken with a grain of salt, but it is interesting.

What are you even arguing? All I am saying is that in a justice system as corrupt as ours you often need a costly lawyer to ensure a fair trail. How could you disagree with that?
@_date: 2014-03-25 19:20:11
Yeah, definitely doesn't fix everything, but the system wants you to feel like you've done something wrong and you almost start to question yourself. Having public support validates your innocence.

Yes and no. In the comments section of the online article that was written about my arrest (public shaming is another tactic) most people were supportive and knew the arrest was unjust. That was huge, knowing the public was on my side, and probably a large reason why the prosecutor bailed on the case. No jury would have convicted me.

Consumer prices would be lower if nobody used cards. You see, merchants are charged as much as 5% fees for credit card purchases which they pass on to the consumer via the price of goods. Enjoy your 2% cashback though.
