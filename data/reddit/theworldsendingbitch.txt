There's nothing mysterious about this phenomenon. When it's moving, people want in on the action. Everyone has goals they desperately want to achieve TODAY, not tomorrow! So a rising asset is much more attractive than something that is in another season. It's just like apples growing on a tree. If you're not a farmer, you don't care about the tree until it's producing apples. Unfortunately that doesn't work well in long term investing.

Why is he shaking hands with that asshole?
@_date: 2019-03-28 07:32:45
yea ok whatever
@_date: 2019-03-09 10:48:47
Wtf is this? 
@_date: 2019-03-16 12:17:18
So no one is allowed to invest in anything besides Bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-03-30 15:27:08
That's how you know they've been planning for Bitcoin for a long time. 
@_date: 2019-03-16 14:09:02
what a stupid attitude
@_date: 2019-03-25 03:16:33
Not a good look.
@_date: 2019-03-09 02:24:57
What a stupid list
@_date: 2019-06-26 20:31:02
Since i couldn't afford shit, $0. OP used $20 as a low example anyway because anything lower than that is so pathetic.

And ironically he was the dumb fuck to trust whoever that was he was talking to. Mark Zuckerburg is a clown.

I think we have at least one more correction before the bull market returns. At least one. Maybe more.
@_date: 2019-06-26 18:41:11
uhh ok
@_date: 2019-02-21 05:20:46
The problem here isn't Venmo, it's the governmet that REQUIRES them to do this. (They will lose their operating permit if they don't). So unless you make government go away, this will continue happening. Good luck with that.
@_date: 2019-02-01 03:00:32
@_date: 2019-02-18 03:06:43
yes we really are.
@_date: 2019-06-03 03:43:19
Fucking loser
@_date: 2019-06-05 04:11:05
Yeah that's it, so deal with it.
@_date: 2019-06-11 03:16:46
Dumb analogy. What Bitcoin really is, is some stupid piece of junk that rich psychopaths have taken over and are trying to pump. Once they milk society, they'll change the narrative. It has already changed. Bitcoin used to be completely different, which is why I struggled to believe in it, early on. There's no way the psychopaths would have been willing to accept it as it was, which was purely decentralized. That's why they fucked it up. If they had not fucked it up, it would be worth $1,000,000+ by now and we would have had a true solution to the problem Bitcoin was originally intended to solve. Now it's become some other shit.

This is no easier to predict than the direction of the wind, and just as pointless. Just buy BTC and let it run its course. BTC is a long term hold. 
@_date: 2019-06-10 01:41:35
ok who cares
@_date: 2019-02-07 21:10:06
3. Get your dick sucked as payment

@_date: 2019-02-06 15:59:07
Imagine if SJW's still had to do all that to post their goofy opinions online.
@_date: 2019-02-16 02:48:18
I hope in 2020 he'll kill himself.
@_date: 2019-04-27 05:14:23
and they got neck injuries just like us, except we got them from looking down at our phones
@_date: 2019-04-05 05:24:22
Exactly 
@_date: 2019-04-14 06:23:58
None of the above
@_date: 2019-04-05 07:07:24
Ya, that's him
@_date: 2019-04-05 11:47:37
Suck my fuckin dick, asswipe.
@_date: 2019-01-29 11:46:48
Moral of the story. Taxes are cancer.
@_date: 2019-01-30 02:36:09
He is an elitist, spineless charlatan. No.
@_date: 2019-01-30 04:04:20
How was I supposed to know that, moron?
@_date: 2017-05-15 08:16:42
Did this cyber attack kill the rally?
@_date: 2019-05-21 22:06:23
That's a stupid gauge of demand.
@_date: 2019-05-09 23:34:26
Nah, I hope that happens to you instead. America is not one identity you dumb ass. It's a bunch of people with different ideas competing. Read a book.
@_date: 2019-05-18 17:04:32
Fuck Nascar.
@_date: 2019-05-09 02:34:10
No because they're not black.

That was the last episode for that guy after 30 years, so this will be a historical episode.

Only problem is most Uber drivers agree with taxi drivers on fundamental issues.
@_date: 2019-05-09 23:31:59
Not surprisingly, a Democrat.
