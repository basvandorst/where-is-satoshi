I would suggest contacting Bob Spiegel and Quotecolo.com. He brokers many mining facilities in North America.  Email is bob

BTC doesn’t do anything “gradually”...if it goes up at all, $8500 isn’t the ceiling for this year...book it!

Don’t waste your time with Gemini ...their Tier IV approval process is archaic....you can have a Tier IV Kraken account in a couple days.  Much better.

Funny thing happened to a buddy of mine today.  The management company for his country club sent him a letter stating that they were going to start charging 3.5% if you paid your dues with a credit card...no shit...saw the email...I’m all WTF..they are basically passing through CC fees to the end consumer and flat-out telling you they are doing it.  The answer is simple folks...if businesses start passing on CC fees to the consumer directly, then the consumer should have the flexibility to choose the payment vehicle with the lowest fees...enter BTC to save the day...let the market (buyers and sellers) decide what’s best.  Hasta-la-VISA bank-backed payments-industry bitches!!
Visa - it’s everywhere you want to be
BTC - it’s just fucking everywhere already

This perception of profitable is poorly articulated in this article.  I could buy an S9 13.5TH right now on Bitmain for $2320 + $105 for a power supply plus ~$90 for shipping.  That’s a $2515 investment that could be recouped in 10 months at current prices and mining difficulty levels with utility power at .10/KWh.  A home miner can still make money here.  Show me another investment vehicle that returns it’s money in less than a year and I’ll show you some oceanfront property in Arizona!
