You have a point there. 
@_date: 2014-01-11 05:00:46
Can you tell me the difference of hoarding and saving? 
@_date: 2014-05-24 17:25:53

Oh of course. I'm only interpreting what you said.

Looks like a lot of fun.

Oh? How many times has your vote changed an election?

Yes, ask your masters for permission first.

1. Develop replacement services that rely on voluntary contributions instead of a monopoly with a coercive tax system 
2. Put the monopoly state services out of business by withdrawing funding and support

It won't always be that way, Bitcoin paved a new way for the development of technologies uncontrollable by the state. In regards to your OP, I'd find a loop hole. There is always more than one.

Since when did government do anything but give lip service to the Constitution? Try and count the laws and regulations that are explicitly unconstitutional, you can't there are too many.

Well, you didn't answer any of my questions.. 


No? Especially not in Texas.


I have no idea what you are trying to say here. 


No, I think it is immoral to force peaceful people to obey rulers and their rules. 
@_date: 2014-03-23 04:44:19
Name one
@_date: 2014-01-11 06:02:27
Wait, so are you libertarian or republican? 
Isn't voting just a way for the majority of voters to force the minority of voters and those who do not or can't vote to comply with a certain edict or obey a certain ruler?  
I know Republicans, obviously, don't have a problem with forcing people to obey their rules and leaders, but libertarians, I thought, were anti-coercion or against using the political means. 
So I'm just unclear to the reasons you might have for voting.

You said that the difference of hoarding and saving was "like the difference between terrorist and freedom fighter." To me that sounds like you're saying it is your individual perception that distinguishes whether or not someone is a terrorist or a freedom fighter. If I think someone is a terrorist and you think of the same person as a freedom fighter, what is the comparison to hoarding and saving here? It seemed like you were saying the difference was whether or not an individual was trying to give you freedom (freedom fighter) or take it away (terrorist). 


I was unsure of your simile's meaning so I wanted to know what you thought it meant. 


Of course you did. I wanted you to tell me what you thought the difference between hoarding and saving was not give me a copy and paste answer from the top of a Google search. Since you asserted that the value of each Satoshi increasing over time "incentivises hoarding a bit." I wanted to know if you knew that your claim of hoarding is the same as crying foul about people who choose to save for the future. 
You proceeded to give me a definition of hoarding that said: "Hoarding is holding a resource to be sold for a profit without adding value it leads to inefficient distribution of resources." A definition of hoarding is not a comparison of hoarding and saving. I gave you a criticism of  your definition and you accused me of putting words in your mouth. 


Like what? 




You're calling me defensive? How do these add anything to the discussion? 


Magic? Really? You sound ridiculous.

Edit: Maybe the name will be, but it would be a far cry from it's current form. Notably, decentralized and absent of state monopoly.

Of course, it's perfectly normal to be afraid of the whip. But when you finally see the plantation for what it really is, the only control your masters have is control over your mind.

They maintain a monopoly on the provision of roads. Since most roads are funded through the coercive tax system and the use of "legal" theft called "Eminent Domain" competitors are driven out of the market since, unlike the state, they cannot "legally" steal from others to fund their roads. 
If the government was the sole provider of shoes, would you tell me that we must have government or else we wouldn't have shoes?

So if I acquire some Bitcoins and choose to hold on to them, because I think my future purchasing power will be more than my current purchasing power or whatever the reason may be, then you will tell me that you know what's best for me and I shouldn't hold on to my Bitcoins for so long because "profit" is bad. 
Inefficient distribution of resources? According to who? You? What makes you think that holding Bitcoin or any resource/commodity is "inefficient distribution of resources?" 
Bitcoin is a deflationary currency by design. This means each unit of Bitcoins will have increased purchasing power over time, which encourages saving. 
The actual difference of saving and hoarding is merely subjective value. People who think I should spend call me a hoarder and people who don't care or think saving is good call me a savor.

First we would have to define 'legal'. For me, anyone who would violently stop or punish people who are peacefully transacting are the ones who are criminals.

Well governments do create 'money' out of thin air and deflation is not 'bad'.

Look, quit acting like you know something about economics. You clearly don't and you know you don't. If your understanding of economics came from your college or high school classes then shut up and go read a book. 
I took some time to gather some resources for you.
