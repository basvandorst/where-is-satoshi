Don't use Kraken until you read the reddit complaints first!  The site is very laggy, and almost impossible to get a trade.  You don't have information on forthcoming buy/sell orders, and the order will go in limbo and maybe execute, or not.  Maybe they have fixed their problems now - I don't know.

Good luck dude.  
This is real - Aussies get scammed. 
My last cointree transaction: A$1000 in, A$630 of bitcoin out. Bitcoin.com.au are better, and the rate is clear, but still &gt;10% margin and you have to run to a bank within 4 hours.
Aussies need a cheaper and online platform for BTC purchases.

I do have a question: according to  "Bitcoin is a censorship resistant, global, open, permissionless ledger that no single person, company or government is in control of."  
There is one problem though: blockchain transactions (copying all those ledgers) need enormous amounts of energy, currently 28 TWh / year or 0.13% of world power use.
This is more than many nations!  For the sake of the planet, this needs to be reduced by many orders of magnitude.
It also makes bitcoin highly vulnerable - all that "they" have to do is to shut off the power.  Those anarchists out there know that this is something "they" can easily engineer.
There are some steps in the right direction, e.g. using crypto to support new energy markets:

Hi everyone - new to the scene - really enjoying these earnest discussions about the meaning of BTC, fiat etc.
I wish I'd got on board earlier - better late than never. Whatever your views of bubble vs technology asset, not being part of this now would be like not being part of aviation in 1910.

Have a thought for the unfortunate people in Zimbabwe, Venezuela, etc, whose economic system has been trashed by their own government.  Apparently BTC sales in Zimbabwe soared last week, with a strong premium over the global price - we are talking about very poor people, trading though local traders in villages.
Are these people "trying to get rich quick"? Not really - just trying to protect what they have, in the face of crisis.
