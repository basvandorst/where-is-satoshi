it could work in a way like coinbase where coinbase account can be funded internationally - from european bitcoin account to coinbase bitcoin account

as a european you can not transfer fiat money easily to american based Coinbase - to buy bitcoins from Coinbase,
but i recently learned that you you can transfer bitcoins directly to your Coinbase account from Europe and start paying to bitcoin merchants immediately,

Remember when HSBC got caught laundering billions for Mexican narco-terror cartels? Remember how they offered to pay five weeks' profits in fines and to defer their executive bonuses to escape criminal charges?
The crime-fighting legal eagles at the Department of Justice approved the settlement last week. Remember, though, if you are suspected of laundering money or selling drugs, the DoJ will take your house away and put you in jail for the rest of your life. Nice to be "too big to jail." Still, deferring multimillion-dollar bonuses has gotta hurt, huh?

it sure is not a world currency yet - and not close to it - if trying to exchange 7 Million of it will crash it 
@_date: 2014-01-20 07:30:30
some of the countries like China and Finland define bitcoin not as a currency but as a commodity,
so if you sent the 5 dollars worth of bitcoin/commodity to Finland , the reciever needs to pay income tax ?

i posted it more for the second part - that he was saying that this time wall street bankers tested how much money is needed to manipulate bitcoin price to a freefall and create panic  ( reddit bitcoin billionaire ) , 
but next time  they will manipulate it to death - he says .,.

Families that dominate the worlds banking industry are trying to strangle bitcoin but its quite impossible to do - 
because of services like localbitcoins.com people transfer money between each other , 
it has to be a full scale censorship and blocking websites by governments , thats the only way to shut down bitcoin related transactions 
@_date: 2013-12-18 08:06:50
what could be the main reason for it - China regulating it heavily and some countries claiming in the past few days that bitcoin is not real money but digital asset ?
@_date: 2013-04-07 20:09:32
what price expectations do you have at the moment - when will it reach 200 usd , when it will hit 500 usd , 
and why 
@_date: 2013-05-15 03:55:08
bitcoin.de - Germany 
@_date: 2013-12-18 08:39:49
why do you think 400 usd is bottom

how bitcoin value changes if mercants dont hold their assets in bitcoins but in dollars and convert to fiat immediately after bitcoin deals,

Some exchanges use double authentication,  like Google Authenticator in addition to password

one of the shareholders of Sky is Rothshild family who are also one of the main shareholders of Federal Reserve, so dont be surprised they attack bitcoin

here would be the place where other exchanges like btc-e or vircurex present all the licences they have or not have

yes looks like no math skills needed to be a bitcoin investor these days 
@_date: 2013-12-01 21:23:31
offline wallet seems like a bad idea,
real use and acceptance as a payment method is what gives the cureency the value, its like us dollar which has no inherent value umless people buy with it for real things
so being in the first camp serves bitcoin better than being in the second camp at the moment, so if you decide to abandon bitcoins then buy something with them
@_date: 2013-12-18 11:11:50
first time i see it explained 
@_date: 2013-12-18 07:23:16
so is it safe to say that chinese government has declared war on bitcoin 
@_date: 2013-12-18 11:10:41
can the chinese use localbitcoins.com and just pay directly for bitcoins to each other , bypassing chinese bitcoin traders ?
@_date: 2013-05-18 19:16:18
seems like they are afraid that governments will seize their bitcoins one day,
just like Zukerberg seized their invention Facebook once
