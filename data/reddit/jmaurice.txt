I live in Tokyo and I know CZ in person. We always use PGP emails to communicate, and I can vouch that this PGP key is actually him, so I signed his key  PGP key here:

Thank you! The more people that independently verify it the better :)

If OKCoin committed fraud to try and get out of a $10K/month contract, it makes you wonder if they are insolvent...

Personally I'm looking forward to the ledger blue, hopefully it ships out soon :)

Forging a contract is pretty bad. Forging proof of reserves and lying to auditors is absurd.

WTF? If your goal is to make a censorship resistant chat network, Lightning is the wrong layer... Lightning is a payment network, build on top of a communications network. Build your chat app on top of the communications network, not on top of a payment network. Does it make sense to build a chat app on top of Uber Eats? No, it makes sense to build it on top of TCP/IP or Tor hidden service etc.

Here's a picture of the three of us sitting together at a cafe after the mtgox creditor's meeting in Tokyo

I'm working with Roger on this project. After OKCoin breached their contract to manage the domain, we had to get a new site up right away. Forking the open source bitcoin.org site was the fastest way to get content up, and now we have several people working on our team to develop the new site. We are also working with the bitcoin.org team to differentiate the two sites. Our fork is also open source, so feel free to contribute and send pull requests:

especially love the genesis block

yes, bitcoin.com is open source: 
feel free to submit your pull-requests!

the bump donations directly finance the development of the site to further promote bitcoin to newcomers. the site is also completely open-source if you'd like to submit pull-requests:

Hasn't this been common knowledge for at least 5 years now?

Well yes, but I'm trying to explain... Following this GoT analogy: if we had used our 51% "hashpower" to produce a longer and less rushed S8 chain of episodes at the same time HBO did, then we could now publish that longer S8 chain and it would orphan the HBO chain. However, because we did not begin "mining" our longer version of the S8 chain, the current HBO blockchain already has a huge amount of additional blocks mined on top of it, so if you began a 51% attack now it wouldn't be able to "go back in time".
Obviously your theoretical "infinite hash power" attack could rewrite any PoW blockchain...

A 51% attack works by using your hashpower to privately mine another blockchain, then broadcasting it later to double spend a transaction. You can't "go back in time" to re-organize blocks before you started mining the 51% attack.
