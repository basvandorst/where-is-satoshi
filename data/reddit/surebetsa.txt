I'm going to sound a bit harsh, but the reason why actual financial professionals keep a distance is because either we see why [thing of the month] bitcoin proposes is flawed/illegal/rube goldbergian/etc or because we know of an already existing solution that works. 
This being said, while I'm an active bitcoin "opponent" I still recognise that it's a thing that exists, and I'm interested in how to interface it with the accounting system of my clients that opted to go against our advice to avoid it as a payment rail. I've been aware of it since late 2011 and I've since helped clients navigate reporting and tax obligations. Just because I don't like it doesn't mean I don't want to understand it.
We could debate the moral qualities of banks for example, argument in which I may voice several of my own issues with some less than savoury practices, but even the most crooked bank will still report account transactions correctly.
Is it ethical for a bank to randomly charge fees for (reason)? Maybe, maybe not. That's a qualitative argument. Will that random fee be correctly be reflected by a line on my statement and deducted from my account total? Most certainly, and that's the quantitative aspect that concern accounting reporting.
I can't even begin to estimate the thousands of lines of statements I've parsed in my career and never has there been an issue where a line is dropped like this:
01/01/2015 - Opening balance|*$1,000.00*||
02/01/2015 - Deposit|$1,000.00||
15/01/2015 - Purchase||$1,000.00|
30/01/2015 - Closing balance|*$500.00*||
Nothing like this has happened to any of my colleagues either. This kind of error just doesn't happen, and even if it did, even the worst bank would have to revert the extra 500$ because good god damn it's right there on paper.
What can happen (I get it about once per 2-3 years) is a data entry error, where say that $1000 deposit was actually a $10k deposit. Typos happen, but there's still a chain of custody documented. If you haven't done a commercial deposit before here's the sequence:
* At the office I gather up the cash/cheques/whatever I want to deposit. I fill in a [deposit slip]( listing the payload.
* At the bank the teller repeats the process by hand tallying the payload and makes their own deposit slip.
   * If the sums don't match there's a recount and both parties figure out where's the discrepancy
* I get a confirmation slip that I staple to my deposit slip, do the data entry back at the office, and confirm the line amount at the end of the month.
The teller is at that moment doing a direct write to my account, unless both of us fuck up but still arrive at the same amount the bank vault recount done later won't directly touch my account. If there is an issue at that point, or if I didn't catch an error at the counter, there's that extra checksum to help me catch the error. In case of serious debate there's still plenty of corroborating evidence to help decide who's right, like the the scans of the cheques that are legally required to be made and retained for a long period.
All this to say, errors will occasionally pop up, but it's on the data entry side, and as long as people and keyboards exist, they'll happen. Bitcoin/crypto doesn't intrinsically prevent errors, and to be honest the no-chargeback feature is something terrifying in this case because expecting 100% entry accuracy is impossible.
Note that I've talked about the most manual process possible, in the case of [EDI]( settled via any [EFT]( method we're comparing something much more similar, with the same potential data entry risks. I don't expect a bitcoin remittance system to require manual address inputs, I'm aware of that even if you had to key in the addresses it's unlikely you'll typo in a valid address but at the same time commercial bank portals will only allow payments to be sent to authorised and pre-entered beneficiaries. Let's assume all things being equal and that in both cases I'm sending payments where they need to get.
We come back to the fact that "ghost lines" (line amount not stated, still debited/credited) just don't can't unless there's a fatal flaw in system implementation, and the same issue could also affect a pure bitcoin statement of account.
Hella long point short, I fail to see how there's a trust issue wrt banks properly reporting account activity. If you have examples I'd be interested to read about them, being also very active in my company IT I love to see documented cases of implementation or hardware failures.


Either you're running 100% of your accounting on chain and it becomes your ledger or you have your local ledger and it refers to transactions on chain as externalities. It can only be either one. Since you can't represent non-real amounts on chain, you have to do the actual accounting off of it, no and no matter how integrated one is in the other from a purely quantitative point of view a bitcoin txn is the same as a cheque idn. Are they qualitatively equal? Maybe, maybe not, but referring to a txn isn't a magical new kind of entry. This thread is littered with journal entry examples already, but as mentioned all writes currently carry contextual information. 


But you still go down the rabbit hole of proving that this even still happened, up until your in your warehouse physically touching the delivered products. How do you certify that over a bitcoin tx?
There's a whole world of internal control management that's out there with decades of real-world use under it's current framework version and literally millennia of past versions. Read up on the [COSO]( framework if you want to see what we currently do and why cryptography can't solve 100% of the known and predicted issues.


See first quote


The problem with proper reporting isn't really altering books retroactively, it's bad or downright fraudulent writes being made in real time. Yeah, Enron had a shredding party, it does happen, but fortunately the way reporting obligations are structured even if their books *and* auditors were crooked there was a mirrored set of records at the IRS plus partial records all over the place.
The really pervasive stuff happens at a much smaller scale, and incidentally is also the bit that really interests managers and owners. Preventing theft, fake invoicing, embezzlement, kickbacks and the rest are magically prevented with bitcoin, especially if my new bitcoin/crypto/magical ledger still allows manual writes. Assuming proper (and legally mandated) record management and replication there's no quantitative difference between doing forensics on a local SQL db and the blockchain.

I would run away from it, fast. Non-publicly traded companies shouldn't have 100% transparency, period. Proper EoY reporting yes, but you'll murder most businesses if they have to disclose details down to a level where they're suppliers and internal ratios are know. It would also be hilariously illegal to publish payroll down to a line item level, and don't get me started on a company that self-underwrites anything related to medical benefits, or worse, therapy, drug-abuse recovery or the likes.
Publicly traded companies and governments already are doing a solid job of reporting down to some depth. Seriously, go looking for those reports. Look up the annotated Enron reports to see how irregularities can be already found. There's definitely more work to be done on governance and reporting, but before thinking about reinventing the wheel y'all should dig into what's already in play.
At any rate keep the questions and comments coming.

Interesting read, but most periodic reports will by default highlight all variances.

I'm not saying they do triple entry. I have an accounting system. It's a separate entity from the bitcoin blockchain. It may refer to it, but from it's point of view the blockchain is still external, a third party.

Beyond confirmation of reception of my invoice, why should I be concerned about the inner workings of my client's company?
I mean this literally, other than select and specific information (they've entered into an agreement on *y* to purchase *x* for *z*$) why is it even desirable that my internal tracking system be not only the same as theirs, but synchronised?
I run Widgets inc. and I send a bill to my client. I recently started my company and I decided to number my invoices in a  format. I haven't made many sales, so I send out invoice  to my client. 
My client, multicorp inc. has been in business for decades and does huge amounts of business. Of course they already received an invoice with the number 123 in the past. In fact, in their first year they realised that since every provider does whatever they want for invoice numbering so they now use the first 4 letters of a company as invoices prefixes. 
When the clerk on their end enters my invoice in their system it becomes known as WIDG-123.
*edit:* Also, just because you're not providing your software with idns doesn't mean it doesn't automatically generates them. Tell me what you're using and I'll tell you how to look this up.
* How is this a problem?
Further down the line, since we started doing a lot of business together, it might become useful to provide more context to each bill to prevent double/erroneous/fraudulent billing. After all we practice the notions that governance and internal control frameworks like COSO promote.
From now on instead of receiving a plain order from them each order has a PO# referenced, number which I must also append to my bills.
Our internal numbering systems are different, sure, but this added layer of identification is standardised. 
* Isn't this good enough?
It's been a few years now and after a some issues with mailed invoices getting lost or delayed, and because in my rapid expansion phase it's really critical for me to make sure no time is wasted when sending out bills and maintaining my cash flow, I setup an EDI bridge with my client.
Still referencing my own idn and PO# I now have direct write access to my supplier account on their end. They've also set me up with some kind of electronic payment.
* From an accounting point of view how is this different than this so called triple accounting?
Really though, why would idn symmetry be an issue at all?


Take any electronic thing you own and open it. Every component has it's own part number, maybe even a serial number. As a consumer, is that information relevant? If the manufacturer buys an lcd panel from his supplier as part number 123 but refers to it as part number abc in their own assembly process and documentation, how is this intrinsically bad?
If I send you invoice  for 20 pn at 10$ a piece as long as you send me back a cheque for 200$ re: invoice  why should I care how you call those parts in your inventory management system?


Once done it certainly is, but like I said as long as there's manual data entry there's a risk of user error.
I have an online banking portal. You have your bitcoin wallet. Neither of us want to manually key in the destination of our funds each time, so we both set up beneficiaries and save them. In both cases let's assume we did an ok job and each of the 10 beneficiaries are correctly identified and point to the correct account/address.
We both end up working late, and in the fog of fatigue we select the wrong beneficiary when sending out a payment. Exact same user error, exact-ish result, except I can't cancel a bitcoin tx.
Now we can argue about the relative merits of compliant financial information storage versus the blockchain, but bitcoin didn't prevent you from clicking on the wrong thing any more than my bank stopped me.

That's still not triple entry, at best it's a more secure form of transaction proof, but 
1) it's not like you can just use anything to justify writes under the current IFRS
2) the best you can do is sign in a comment like "payment for bill  with the transaction, but you're still referring to outside documentation for context.

I have redundant copies of both my personal and financial records. Where we could argue is the way I do it, but having redundancy directly within my books in a way that doesn't help integrity (any double entry already needs to be A=B, adding the extra step of A+B=C does nothing) or survivability (it's a local copy) is useless.

I addressed the nomenclature issue of triple entry &gt; double entry a few times elsewhere in this thread, at the very least someone who wants to promote this "triple entry" should not attempt to compare it favourably to double entry because the two concepts are wildly different (method of accounting vs method of database replication).
Also [EDI]( already is a thing, and isn't considered triple/nth entry accounting.
If I sell some widgets to my client and we bridged our accounting systems over EDI, transmit a bill, then later at the end of the quarter transmit my sales to my financial government entity to assess interim tax remittances, even if I end up with the information stored in 3(+) databases I still only made a single entry. The same would be true with redundant data stores, with a local copy of the accounting db on my machine, a local backup in the building and a remote back up, I'm still doing a single entry.

That's not an accounting system. As long as my accounting system is something external from the bitcoin blockchain or open transactions or whatever, and refers it's transaction ledger to it, any payment system (as fancy and immutable as it is) is still a third party and doesn't write a third entry any more than other conventional transactions.
We already include transaction context information in ledger writes, such as a wire transaction reference.
There could be an interesting debate to be had wrt the rate of bank errors, the IAS norms that detect them in real world accounting and the lizard people illuminati in charge of the banks conspiring to enslave humanity that only bitcoin can defeat, somehow, but that's all qualitative.
Quantitatively, assuming in good faith and for the sake of argument to keep all things equal that the information generated by my bank specifically concerning the identification of each transaction event is right (and that I took a peek in my bank account to confirm that indeed there is *n*$ in there as it should be, how is a bitcoin txn different from a wire confirmation number, and how does it suddenly warrant a shift from including it once per transaction write summary to once every single god damned line in my ledger, aka from this:
| Account   | Debit    | Credit     |
| Widgets|          1000$||
|   Money|          |       1000$|
*(Payment  on 01/01/2015, in reference to bill 
to this:
| Account   | Debit    | Credit     | TXN       |
| Widgets|          1000$||
|   Money|          |       1000$|
*(Payment on 01/01/2015, in reference to bill

Same goes for a bitcoin transaction, but in reverse. You have a provable payment event, but without the possibility to provide context without referring to something external still.
Even if you sign your transaction with "payment for bill  "for services rendered on 01/01/2015" or "wage for the week of 01/01/2015" you can't prove that that event actually happened without referring to a third party.
I don't get how bitcoin is perceived as better than an existing known-and-trusted source of information like a bank statement, much less how you think specifically the bitcoin txn is a magical third entry and any other payment identification number isn't.
@_date: 2015-05-08 21:29:15
The value of which is still represented in the first two entries, anchored by a transaction reference.
@_date: 2015-05-08 22:01:11
A bitcoin txn is still a third party system identifier from my accounting system's point of view. 
@_date: 2015-05-08 21:29:38
You still have externalities.

As mentioned elsewhere:
* Non-real valuations: It's fine to point to a bitcoin transaction for my services bought or rendered, my payroll payouts and my investments, but how can I account for client accounts, taxes owed, amortisation, and just about anything in my liabilities?
* If the "actual" ledgers are something that is then not a series of live transactions but a simple act of uncoupling my books from the transactions themselves breaks the "transactions as the accounting" concept, and having unrestricted write abilities via the paired regularisation ledger means I can do the same shenanigans as before
You're confusing the statement of cashflow with the core accounting reporting tools. Before looking at that statement I need to have a functional charter of accounts and periodic p/l statements.
Oh, and since we're already using identifiers on every transaction writes, the qualitative value of a current idn vs a cryptographic one may be up for debate, but it's not "new" quantitatively and your model is still double entry. Double entry means that for every +*n*$ applied to one or more accounts -*n*$ is applied elsewhere. 
If I buy a car for 10k$ for my business in a state with a 10% recoverable sale's tax the transaction looks like this:
10001 - Bank account (*bank*)|$11,000.00||
 15100 - Motorized vehicules||$10,000.00|
 11150 - Recoverable sale's taxes||$1,000.00|
*(Purchase of [car] on 01/01/2015 via cheque  [car dealer])*
If this subject interests you I suggest you have a look at some intro accounting courses. No need to dive deep in the more complex fiscal aspect (although you may very well want to, it's fun) but having a better grasp of the fundamental structure of the current system will help you see the issues with your model.

No, it's not. The reason it's called double entry accounting is that everytime *n*$ moved in one or more of my accounts, -*n*$ must move in counterparty in one or more of my other accounts.

Note the bunch of contextual comments. Those are already a thing. An important thing. A useful thing. A required thing.
As for not making mistakes, I'll avoid looking smug and thinking the phrase "no charge backs", but it's safe to say that long as someone is going to type in data, there are errors that are going to creep in.
I can automate things and pull information via APIs with existing software and infrastructure, surely something similar could be built on the bitcoin side, but going bitcoin doesn't intrinsically make it error free. 
@_date: 2015-05-08 18:28:21
So basically the transaction number, which is totally different from what's happening today because of course we're not identifying the current ledger writes with a time stamp or a bill# or a project# or a client/provider reference number or...
Oh wait, was this supposed to imply that running my books straight in the ~blockchain~ is the way to go? Ok cool, but unless I can add the aforementioned client/provider/*actual accounts being affected*/reference number/etc writes directly in the blockchain, I still need to add a local level of management.
It would also mean I'd need to populate reference accounts like my running amortization taken total on my assets with bitcoin, which is insane.

Interesting read, but


It's already the case. EoY regularisation or simple error corrections are already append only. If I manage to include a typo on both sides of the entry I'll later write a regularisation correcting all affected accounts with a write comment explaining why, but the original write is still there.


No. Well, not exactly. The first level accounting process is only interested in correctly recording the financial dataset put in front of it. Later on there's an auditing process to find out irregularities, but the primary layer of authentication is at the information aggregation level.
An accounting technician will process all documents put on his desk and only red flag a thing when it's obviously problematic (a monthly bill that's always been 100$ suddenly jumping to 1000$ for example) and the controller will investigate the issue.
Insuring the raw data integrity is the concern of internal controls, secured by things like the [COSO framework]( The accounting department has a role to play here but most of the burden is either carried by an independent audit control committee for large organisations or an ad hoc committee of accounting/operations managers in a smb environment.


Excluding cash everyone is already maintaining some level of ledger, their bank account statement.
Also it's not a purist stance of view to say consumer level transactions can be represented in double entry. Even losing your wallet can be represented.


Let's say you bank with truly terrible people. Like, literally Hitler. At random intervals they'll ding your account with a 20$ "fuck you" fee. Because reasons. This fee has never been discussed, in fact your 3 clause service contract that fits on half a page lists these points:
* The client will pay 10$ per month for his account and have access to unlimited transactions.
* There are no additional fees.
* Free cake at the end of the month.
You've been with them for a few months now, wondering why you put up with this bullshit. You've paid a few hundred dollars in fuck you fees at this point, and worse, no cake.
Are they honest? 
I know you want to say no, but the answer is actually "it depends". Don't get me wrong, what they're doing is illegal, but if you look at your fictitious bank statement, do you see line items called "fuck you"? Are you seeing the 20$ charges, and are they correctly reflected in the end of month balance? Guess what, from a purely quantitative and accounting point of view, they're honest.
Unless you see a bank statement with missing line items and an unbalanced "end of month balance" = ("opening balance" + credits - debits) equation they're properly reporting account activity. Unless there's an implementation or really exotic hardware failure these errors don't happen.
Separate the qualitative and quantitative aspects of financial institutions. I've yet to see a context where a bank issues out incorrect information. That information might imply improper client treatment, but it's still being correctly reported.


False. There is a metric fuckton of IAS norms and obligations. I can't unilaterally interpret events, it has to fit within standardised reporting frameworks. 
Easy example, my company purchases a truck. The way I structure financing, purchase options, expected usage metrics and the rest is flexible to a point, but once I settle on an interpretation of that event (which needs to meet minimum realistic IAS guidelines) I can't retroactively change it, and if the truck's fair market value changes significantly mid-life there are further guidelines and obligations as to how to represent that fmv change.


It depends. Objectively the obligations are more complex than a 3 employee mom and pop shop, sure, but with larger datasets &amp; more complex reporting guidelines also comes much more interesting business intelligence. 


This is a UX/UI and training issue. Distributing the ledgers doesn't solve this and probably adds a further obfuscation layer.


What the hell? Seriously. This is patently false wrt what's happening in reality. No healthy company segregates it's accounting, and every time you send out an invoice you're already crediting your client accounts and debiting your sales/services rendered.


But... this already happens? We negotiate a contract. This isn't a accounting event yet. You send in your first purchase order. I reference it in my accounting system with that PO# and your client idn. That anchored write has the same line values. I ship out the product and join the bill with it. I created an account receivable write, you now create an account payable write. They both reference that original PO# and client/supplier idn. You send a payment, the amount is recorded on both ends. I have a payment idn.
This is accounting 101. We can further streamline over EDI/EFT. 
Are you saying that we should integrate 100% of our books? Because lol, no.


Why is cloud storage intrinsicly better, assuming I'm already respecting ISO-27***? Also current accounting dbs aren't magical, if I'm running SQL for example I can already do remote calls and writes if needed. Even with legacy 1980's System i servers there's nothing preventing me from doing remote interfacing.








Quantitatively this is no different than a bank transaction idn. Or the proof that I have the correct login to my online banking.




Why is this the primary requirement? Or beyond minimum UX and usability, even a requirement at all? Also I'm not sure you want to bring in lightweight wrt to blockchain and mempool/UTXO.


Either you've worked in pen to paper departments or hilariously non-compliant ITSEC places.


No. The ledger itself can't possibly be aware of the fmv of literally every object in every state in the world. That's the job of the controller to feed in correct fmv, not of the ledger to spit out exception errors except in very specific cases.


Jfc no. Just all the noes. All of them. Again, your ledger isn't some kind of AI, it can't walk down into your warehouse and confirm the existence of [thing]. Internal controls, proper inventory reporting and all those nice things exist so that a) we can confirm that [thing] made it to the warehouse after purchase, and b) if it hasn't sold it still there during the interim/annual inventory checks.
The rest of your criteria are already covered by any minimally functional accounting system.
The rest of your thing goes on to describe bitcoin transactions as a magical third entry. A transaction idn. Have you not been recording tx idns, dates and client context with your previous writes? 
I don't know in what capacity you previously participated in the auditing process, but most of what you written makes no sense. 
@_date: 2014-09-14 18:50:21

Here, let me restate my point because I apparently offended you.
"Even assuming that my bank knowingly attempted to deceive me by communicating often incorrect financial information, i still possess the means to identify and correct such erroneous information and confront them, because i adhere to financial reporting standards."
But you're right, don't mind me, i'm a state paid fudder. My questions and comments are obviously trolling. 
@_date: 2015-05-08 17:38:43


I'm tempted to leave this at [citation needed] but lemme ask you this instead, do you not think that literally any accounting system or financial whatever doesn't already bind a transaction to a reference number, like a bill project# or something else?


Unless the numbering system and exact txid concerning your transactions are known in advance, which in a bitcoin world it couldn't be, this is a very bad and dangerous way to proceed.
You don't want to automatically push money because someone sent you bill  you want to push money because provider  send you a bill wrt project  for the amount of 555$.
You can add margins and exception reporting on a dataset like that, not on a single tx numbering system used by both all of your clients and all of your providers.
@_date: 2015-05-09 02:21:09

You're confusing accounting, which is concerned with the periodic reporting of financials, with proper financial security, which in a sufficiently large organisation already tracks expenditures in real time.
@_date: 2015-05-09 05:52:38
We're already mutually referencing; with the delivery of [product] and or [service] I send out a bill, whose number is then used as their reference number for the event.
They then reply with a payment via [method] that carries it's identifier (in the case of cash you're obligated to provide a receipt, in the case of a trade you're obligated to document the fair market value assessment on both ends in case there's additional goodwill reporting to be done [your parents trade you a 500k$ building for the first 50k$ car you build, the building doesn't magically gain a 50k$ fmv, 450k$ gets reported elsewhere] and in both cases the extrant documents are identifiable).
That payment is recorded on your end and said reference number is included in the write commentaries.
Once more, interesting debate to be had wrt the relative worthiness of my manually written cash receipt slip's identification number versus your bitcoin txn, but in both cases the write would already carry some kind of identification.
Direct third party writes are already a thing via various methods of [EDI]( by the way.
Also in your case both party share a third party idn for each event, whereas right now each party emits one and receives one. Honestly I can't really argue either way which is best, as long as both parties are able to follow the write movements. 
Having the same idns isn't really important as long as my idn references your idn.
@_date: 2015-05-09 21:12:31
From a purely quantitative point of view, how is this different than using current transaction idns like a wire confirmation number?
Contextual information has always been added to any accounting journal write, double entry refers to the fact that for every +*n*$ in one or more account there has to be -*n*$ in one or more other accounts.

Also, try as hard as you want to argue minutiae, for all it's merits and flaws, it's still a payment rail and you still need to actually do accounting on your own end, even if (and I say this without arrogance or slight) your financial needs are small and simple enough to 100% automate, because you can't 100% automate this stuff past a certain point.
A bitcoin transaction is still a payment sent/received in my ledger if it happens, it's txn is still but just a reference number that gets relegated to the comments, and in the end the txn still doesn't get it's own column in my ledger.

This is exactly what I was hoping to uncover, even if I disagree with the author.
He seems to put forward scenarios where apparently a computer wasn't able to properly add up double entry transactions in which either the programmer or the computer *seriously fucked up*, because if your financial system isn't able to follow +x/-x, +y/-y operations it's got bigger issues than reporting compliance.
As for the rest, I can't figure out if the author misunderstands the proper usage of *accounting* double entry term or if he's referring to database structure, but in the first case we already cover event context with reference numbers, and in the other we already do way more than just 3 db writes for each transaction.

Interesting points, and I'll agree that this whole thread was maybe a bad idea because of the language barrier, but I was curious to see why you guys were re-appropriating an accounting term.
Time locking a transaction wouldn't really work, and least not in a better way than automating writes with current tools. Same goes for colored coins.
Wrt the blight to my profession that A&amp;A's Enron and co dealings, yes the primary accounting records were destroyed but since a copy of the disjointed information existed in bank and gov't records it was reconstructible. Bitcoin doesn't solve this issue since even if it's an arguably more durable secondary store of information the main accounting system is still a set of physical or software books that can be fudged. 
Furthermore while a bitcoin transaction can include auxiliary information and attempt to contextualize itself a bit, as I mentioned in my previous long ass reply, it's still an external component to an accounting system. There's an interesting argument to be had between the relative reliability of bitcoin txns versus banking reference numbers, from a purely functional point of view it's still money in, money out, a timestamp and a reference number.
I'd recommend dropping the triple entry accounting bit of bitcoin newspeak because anyone with even an introductory accounting class under their belt is going to raise an eyebrow.
@_date: 2015-05-08 22:32:30
Let me restate the various points your making, feel free to tell me if I misunderstood something.
My original question was re: what the hell is triple entry accounting. Most of the replies have been to the effect that the third entry is the txn, to which I say that we already include event reference numbers (and client information, project number, billing codes and a ton more information.
What is then put forward is that the transaction reference number of a bitcoin tx is better than one from a bank wire.
From a 100% technological point of view, and all things being equal, do the 6000ish bitcoin nodes have a better survival rate than the ISO-27*** compliant data stores of my bank? Maybe, I guess, if we start talking about resilience to events that would affect me in more significant ways than the availability of my bank statement. 
Yes I have had to deal with bank errors in the past, but to my recollection they've always been associated with weird edge involving manual bank personnel transactions, like a first international bank wire, setup of a remittance account or timely processing of whatever paperwork.
For single point A to point B payments I guess you could look at a large enough data set that actual hardware errors and implementation issues start to manifest. [This for example]( prompted me to give a call to my financial institution and have an interesting conversation with an operation's manager. Have I gone in person to examine each server rack and confirm all their machines are running ECC'ed ram? No. Am I satisfied that they said they were? Yes.
Even if my bank started to throw out errors, as I'm compliant with financial record keeping all it takes to resolve the issue is for me to give them a call, forward a copy of whatever relevant info and we work it out. If it happens once a year cool, someone fucked up, it happens. More often and I might ask for a discount, or simply go elsewhere.
The entire reason a business like mine, and any other for that matter, bothers with accounting is to generate informational and actionable information as well as to find anomalies.
The beauty of double entry is that I'm checking the integrity of the information given by my bank at the same time as my own internal one.
As much as I share a dislike of the profiteering ways of banks as another sane adult, I don't think that there's a plot to feed me bad information.
Now, with regards to the notion of third party, from my internal point of view, bitcoin *is* still a third party. Once a transaction is on the blockchain I'll admit I'm 100% sure it stays there, but I still need to take that information and plug it in my ledgers.
You can't run an entire ledger off of the blockchain, because as I've said some of the values are either non real (the running tally of the depreciating of a company car for example) or are the representation of a physical asset (if my company's building has a fair market value of 1,000,000$ and I list it as such in my balance sheet, how can I translate that as a transaction to the blockchain?).
Also, just because I can point to a transaction emanating from one of my known bitcoin addresses and say with 100% confidence that it happened, how can certify beyond doubt that it's associated with the payment of bill  Have the supplier send bill  as a signed bitcoin transaction? Alright, how can I prove that I actually received the contents of bill  Signing waybill  Alright, what if it's an empty box? Have every item engraved with unique serial numbers pushed to the blockchain? But what if... ad nauseum.
Even if some radical (and tbf hilariously simplified) new accounting method was devised to run 100% on chain, you still need to refer to externalities.
So a bitcoin txn as proof of payment? It's alright, seriously I have nothing against this as a reference number, but it's a reference number like any other, which are already included either as manual transaction comments in pen to paper ledgers or transaction comments in electronic book keeping. Can stuff already be automated via APs? Sure can, and it's still a requirement (and a good idea) to go over them at least monthly.
I'm not seeing how this is different from an accounting point of view.

@_date: 2015-05-08 21:09:09
Do I have enough C++ knowledge to give you a top down run through of every line of code? No.
Do I understand how the thing works? Better than most. 
My point is that you can't run an entire chart of accounts on the blockchain, because some of the values are for lack of a better term imaginary, or they simply are there to represent an asset I own.
For example, I own a business and I need to purchase a truck. I pay for that truck in cash (or bitcoin). There are no financing events created. 
| Account   | Debit    | Credit     |
| Cash|          10,000$||
| Vehicles ||           10,000$|      
*Paid cash to John Smith on 01/01/2015 for Toyota truck*
We're done, right? Under the bitcoin triple entry model there might be a third column with the txn, which is already covered in the current system with transaction notes.
What you're arguing is that bitcoin is magic because I can pull the information directly from the raw transaction and point to that as a tx note in my accounting system. 
Cool, but I can already reference that payment using existing tools. I can already pull the transactions from my bank account in real time.
You might argue that the blockchain is more resilient than me keeping a pdf copy of my bank statement, but in the real world there are various compliance obligations clearly defined both for the integrity of the original information and it's subsequent safe-keeping. You can't just write gibberish, and there are ways to find out both internally and externally if you fudged your books.
But fine, let's say that in an extreme edge case where I cooked my books, hacked my banks to make their books corroborate mine, then hacked my counterparty's books and banks, then somehow made sure every other personal, corporate and governmental entity also suffered the same faith, yeah the fact that bitcoin has a distributed copy of the transactions edges out.
Problem is that's simply not how one commits fraud in the real world, you embezzle by overcharging or creating transactions for fictitious reasons, both of which can just as easily happen whether I'm transacting via a bank or bitcoin. Bitcoin doesn't magically prevent me from moving a sum to an illegitimate account.
On top of that, since you missed my point of informational accounts, that truck you bought earlier, unless you expect to use it only during the current year, it'll have to take depreciation.
IAS16 clearly defines the rates and periods, and EoY you'll have to take a regularisation to reflect on the actual value of the asset. If the truck is expected to be amortised on a 5 year period with a 20% divestment value, it's not going to stay in your assets at 10,000$ for that entire period.
Each year you need to take an amortisation charge of 1600$, and every year after the first that amount also gets pushed to the running amortization total of the asset to properly represent it's value.
How the hell are you going to make these writes on the blockchain?
My point has always been that bitcoin isn't some magical new kind of accounting. At best it's a publicly auditable proof of payment, which is fine and dandy, but apart from being a really solid anchor for a financial event where party A moved n$ to party B, it doesn't really prove anything with having to resort to external context.

You're not concerned with payment intermediate steps in accounting; I don't care from a ledger point of view if my client has initiated a bank transfer to pay his bill, it only hits the books once it hits the account, so receiving that wire would be the "final manifestation" I guess.
Same goes for the unified standard thing, whatever you think it means. Are we talking about the interface layer? I'm pretty sure that the web is the current unified layer, where I can see all the transactions that happened. Heck, even if we count physical payments, that's only a second layer to take into account, that gets reported in the top one anyway.
Re: embezzling, you're confusing the tools used to report the financial events and their integrity compliance obligations. The embezzling methods used in the real world aren't suddenly thwarted by bitcoin, I could ask my provider for a kick back or pad my expense account just as easily with bitcoin.
What you don't seem to get is that you can't run an accounting system directly on the blockchain, it'll always be an external entity to your actual ledger, therefore you're only switching one middle man for another.
Re: provably remitting payments and all that, you're confusing proof of payment as an accounting requirement with actual accounting book keeping.

The second I read "predictive" I cringed. Financial reporting is supposed to *report* what happened, not extrapolate on it, at least not on the balance sheet and P/L statement. You can only start to add projected amounts in certain very specific accounts (like establishing your expected rate of client non-payment) and even there you're bound by very strict guidelines and rates.
If we're moving out of the convention accounting definition of double entry, hell, every time I write a transaction I'm involving 2+ accounts, and then adding contextual information like a provider/client, a date, a reference number, etc...

- If so, it's easier to upsell site services since the cash is there, however there are security and regulatory issues to attend to.
- If not, doesn't this in effect remove revenue for reddit gold? Also, assuming it's a popular feature, won't this just create further transaction spam à la Satoshi Dice, assuming all payments are on-chain?
2) Reddit Notes, what happens?
- If it's still being developed, wouldn't it be completely schizophrenic to push for parallel implementations?
- If it's not, are the earmarked funds going to be used in something like buying a whole bunch of bitcoins to seed user wallets?
3) Many users and subs have been hostile towards tipbots, is there a plan to allow opting-out? What kind of impacts do you think forcing this on the entire user base would cause?
4) What are the motivations behind this feature? What are the expected/hoped for results? Would you qualify this more as either Reddit rolling out a new feature set or Reddit actively proselyting on behalf of bitcoin?

But that's still not a triple entry, otherwise we're already for all intents and purposes running on a triple+ system. We already anchor transactions with time and context.
And even if you try and anchor your ledger on a bitcoin transaction, the only context you have is a sum going from point A to point B (or multiple sums on either end, or multiple points with combined transactions). There's nothing that intrinsically binds that transaction to an event more than a paper receipt or electronic statement.

Why the redundancy then?
@_date: 2015-05-08 21:14:10
You don't seem to understand that a 100% bitcoin business still has to run accounting beyond bookmarking transactions on blockchain.info.
You're misunderstanding the difference between the accounting system/records and the payment rails used to remit money in reply to accounting events.
@_date: 2015-05-08 21:17:09
Your argument is that all my accounting information could be ran on the blockchain (it couldn't) because having a single source of information is apparently the best thing ever (it isn't), therefore I mentioned that as far as information gathering is concerned my online banking site is just as unified.
@_date: 2015-05-08 17:48:39
Are you thinking of a T account?
Unless you're doing your book pen to paper *and* not generating any kind of interim financial reporting, aka you're basically stuffing a shoe box with your receipts and not really doing accounting, you already have that sum.
It's the account balance, automatically generated. Also by inlining that total as a third column all you're doing is setting yourself up for a shitload of redundant EoY account regulations. 
@_date: 2015-05-08 21:18:12
Either you read the raw transactions outputs for fun or you're trusting some third party's bitcoin application, if you want to be that pedantic.
@_date: 2015-05-09 03:51:31
Most of the features (including all of the programmable ones) mentioned in that video aren't much past the proof of concept stage as external, added layer services, much less native to the current bitcoin core.
As for understanding cryptography intimately to understand the real world application of the products built on it, I have to disagree. It certainly helps, but so long as you have a reasonable understanding of how it's effect you can at least participate in a discussion within some limits.
In this case, that each divisible bitcoin fragment is uniquely identifiable, that there's persistent and unalterable (well except for those couple rollbacks, but let's chalk that up to growing pains) storage of movement and all that isn't what I'm questioning.
I works, albeit we could have a separate debate about it's merits as a whole, so let's leave it at that.
The problem is that you can't represent non-real amounts in their actual amounts on chain. An easy example is a client account, if I offer a credit to my client with the understanding that he needs to pay me within 30 day, I'd account for that as a debit to my stock and a credit to my client accounts, with a subsequent reversal of that account to my cash account on payment.
The reason why it's important that the full amounts get represented on chain is that if they're not, what's actually happening with the use of minuscule amounts of coloured coins is that while i'm storing information on chain, I still need to decipher it with a charter of accounts off chain, which kind of defeats the purpose.
And by the very nature of accounting, even if my company holds so much cash that i can literally represent non-real amounts of money with piles of real money, i still need to account for that money in the main cash reserves and i can't because it's elsewhere.
So while there's probably an interesting demo with coloured coins to be built, the fact is that the *bitcoin* blockchain can't simultaneously act as my payment system and ledger. There's always a translation layer that needs to be built on top, and if that's stored locally with no backup how is this better than a single pc accounting system used in a smb currently?
Again, for all it's merits and flaws, a bitcoin txn is an externality to my actual accounting system, and debate it superiority versus a bank txn, it's still not a magical third entry.
@_date: 2015-05-29 20:08:50
@_date: 2015-05-08 21:12:35
If I wire a payment to my provider I get a confirmation number, same as a bitcoin txn.
Where we can argue is the relative integrity of both confirmation numbers, but from an accounting point of view, in both cases I still have a double entry transaction, it's anchored to an event reference number in both cases and nothing requiring a third brand new bitcoin only entry happened.
@_date: 2015-05-08 21:41:03
You seem pretty certain that they would be lower, however in both cases once you query either a bank api or the blockchain and pull the new transactions, how would information management differ?
I can whip up something that pulls JSONs from my bank if a few lines of code, just as I'm sure the same would go from pulling from either a local bitcoin node or a *~third party block explorer~*, the actual development costs would lie at the "interpret this and find irregularities in patterns and flag out-of-bounds exceptions". 
Both systems could probably run on a similarly spec'ed machine, and my true upkeep costs are more related to payroll so I can sit down an actual human to use this information and generate security analysis.

Lol, please, save these weak burns. 
If the use case is to automatically switch from one provider to the next, anything blockchain doesn't add anything to current possibilities, and that's even if we take into account all the desired smart contract features that aren't implemented.
There's a fixed and known amount of electric providers &amp; resellers that can service your area. Either they they already publish their rates online, or if you're a really specific case, they state them in your service contract.
From there you want to monitor effective rate changes and any other criteria and move from one provider to another if needed. There's literally no need to have a decentralized trustless whatever in place for this.
On your end, you're never renegotiating a contract; you state that you're willing to purchase different forks of power at different forks of prices; *a*-*b* KWh @ *c*-*d*¢/KWh, *e*-*f* KWh @ *g*-*h*¢/KWh.
If you go out of bounds you can already provision logic to either crash or stop your usage, at which point you really want human intervention. Hell, if you're a business, you could add logic layers to consider everything from cost-of-goods all the way down to reputation loss costs.
Finally, if you're running enough things to warrant it, you could automate shutting down appliances and machinery depending on the current rate.
Literally all of this already exists. Please explain to me how it can be improved by the ~blockchain~.
@_date: 2016-02-19 17:29:20
Or just query the prices each provider's api. There's literally no reason for anything blockchain to do this.

"4050 bitcoins per month, 1.5m$"
that would make the price 370, so it's either flat out wrong or refers to figures from last november, in which case 
"20-25 bitcoin per day"
times 30 days, 600-750 bitcoins per month, so obviously less than the 4050 claimed
also if we're using last november's price, taking into account the (admittedly) modest rise in difficulty, that gets 17.4-21.8 bitcoins today if my napkin math holds
whatever, let's say 22.5 bitcoins per day at 250$ is rougly 170k per month (lol 1.5m$), so about 90k$ revenue after electric, but without any costs, none the least the amortized cost of the miners, of which the dude claims there are currently 3000 running

Among the dozen violations, documented in the spring, was that an air well on the second floor was being used as a habitable space and packed with tables, chairs, a hammock, bottles, sound system and large propane grill.
A reinspection in September by housing inspector Bobbi Lopez revealed that the building still lacked cover plates for outlets and light switches and the gas stove needed to be replaced with electrical cooking appliances, among other violations."
"i had some friends that lived at 20 mission. it was awful. like super awful. i think i posted about it before. the entrance and first room looks nice and updated and cool and chic, and then you go upstairs and there are holes in the ceiling and each room is just a dorm room with single ply drywall between rooms and a full size bed takes up 70% of the floor space.
