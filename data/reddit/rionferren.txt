This makes it pain in the ass for people who run exchanges.  Doesn't change anything for the consumers. It is still not a legally-recognized currency. People have been using Bitcoin as a form of payment method long before then.

Except, there are altcoins available that are far more capable than Bitcoin.
It's wise to diversify your crypto-currency investments today in 2017.

You can tell them to fuck off.

There was another coin that sold for $250 with the promise that it was going to enhance Bitcoin experience 
@_date: 2017-01-05 19:55:25
Where? I would like to know as well.
@_date: 2017-08-26 15:51:36
Nothing. Bitcoin is getting slower and more expensive to use. Don't mind these shills.

If coinbase is going to take themselves seriously, then they need to get rid of that god awful limit. They're digging their own graves here.

This. I sure as hell was scared but still stuck to my fucking guns and held my $500 bitcoins even when it went down to $200. This technology has so much potential that average person wouldn't understand it yet. 
@_date: 2017-01-08 05:48:25
Yes. Also had this account since 2013

There there...

Do you know when it'll be ready for consumers to use?
@_date: 2017-01-05 13:59:17
No problem!

Mass adoption isn't likely at the moment until speed of transaction and ease of use are improved

Go read his original manuscript.

Seriously. I'm eyeing on $1500 at least.

I'll give Gemini a try and ditch Coinbase. Thanks!

Wallet file contains your private keys. Much more convenient to just back that up. 
@_date: 2017-01-05 19:05:58
Let's be honest, we all have been there.

Whatever original **value** of payment the user paid in their country's currency rate, yes.
@_date: 2016-12-28 17:02:37
I would wait for the inevitable crash then buy it. Not now.

new equivalent of the worth of your 1BTC in your country at the time you spent it

Satoshi doesn't support BitCore's vision, sadly. 
@_date: 2017-01-04 23:38:34
But if you lose that hardware wallet, you're shit out of luck.

Shh just play along. Big brother is watching.
