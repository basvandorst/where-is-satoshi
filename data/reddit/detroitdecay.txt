I truly think there is a market for the "silver" to BTC's gold. I have a small amount of litecoin. The more interesting part to me is first darkcoin and then once mining is done where the mining houses can develop their own alternative coins based on holding (theory only). 
As far as scrypt asic's I don't fully understand the hatred for them. The price barrier to mining is tough now however with alt coins are we not going to see prices drop in mining gear as the technology becomes more common place?

From my understanding of asic technology, it will level off to minor advancements just like other tech. If you say btc is staying top then only focusing on alternatives coins it would make sense the last great advancements will be made at litecoins end? Then just reusing the same technology.

Good opportunity to suggest wallets. Mycelium and armory?

Sorry I was on the run yesterday and couldnt fully engage in this conversation's comments. I started mining in the ASiC age so when i speak to ASIC its from the stand point of they only help the network become more secure. The cost of ASIC (even new tech) should stop being innovative as time goes on. Look at the PC's cpu for example. The advancements are minor compared to new chips from year to year through the 90's to early 2000's. I can't imagine that ASIC would be much different especially at the exponential rate of development. 
hope that makes sense.

Correct. Two different asic will be needed. Thus why I think by litecoins end both will be developed fully. Scrypt and Sha256

I care. I mine at Slush. No idea how else I can help.

Kinda like cyber begging

It used the same source code. It can be called a fork of the code.
