That's a very inspiring story man! I'm trying to do something similar with something else.

Whether bitcoin survives as an entity in the cryptocurrency train is irrelevant. The idea of anonymous decentralized economy is alive and well in the conscious minds of many, and Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general are an excellent symbolic representation of that. If bitcoin disappears from the face of the planet tomorrow, the imprint remains... until the men in black people come in with their memory erasers or whatever it's called.

I don't know shit about shit when it comes to brute-force attacks, but from the little bit I've read, isn't it possible to bruteforce the key to that wallet?

Haha it's kind of tricky when you take into account the spectrum of human behavior isn't it? You could just keep adding options though.
What I'm thinking here is that the coins are frozen in this pool forever making them useless. Nobody benefits from this except for raging lunatics. That's like someone talking you into buying x, and when you decide to buy it and give him money, he sticks your $100 bills into a paper-shredder and tells you to fuck off. I can't imagine a situation where most would do that.
So with that being said, you could just add more options. A kind of balance system between the parties. In this case, the buyer has the power to stop payment to the seller. The seller also has power to stop payment to the buyer. They also have the option to green light the payment to the opposite party anytime they want. But until then, the money is stuck in the escrow grid.
With this, my logic says if the buyers want their money back, they would have to return the package unopened or with the item still intact with a tracking order as proof. Maybe send it to a "return mailbox" location only known by the seller. That way the seller gets his merch back and gives the buyer his/her money back. The only reason the seller would NOT give the money back is if he was pissed at the buyer or something...though you could have a limit on how many transactions you can have on the escrow system at any given time. This way, the spiteful would still have to give you your money back right? 
with this kind of system, there would need to be some kind of "refund policy" advertised by the seller, but I'm starting to draw a blank right now so I wouldn't know how that would work.

Thanks! I knew there had to be some options out there but search results never get you what you need sometimes no matter how many combos you throw at it. 
It should still be faster and easier than this though. Physical bitcoin exchanges need to happen FAST! This world is just getting smaller and smaller and all that paper is becoming useless faster than the Fed Reserve prints dollar bills with cocaine in it.

that's pretty cool. thanks for the link. so what's stopping online anonymous marketplaces from implementing something like this?
