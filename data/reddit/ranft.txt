Either inform me or go your way, politeness isn't all that hard.

Ah, now I understand your point. I agree its going to be hard to make the connections, but many court cases and charges have to work with circumstantial evidence and are used to work with vague certainties, so it's not surprising they are doing this here. For me this entire thing sends more of a message to the Russians: look, you tried your tech and found a foolish club (DEMs), but we know exactly, aka. by name, who is involved. As of now, so in the future: we will always find those responsible. It doesn't make much of a difference for me in the domestic political play in the US to announce names. Rights are going to refute the Russia hack, Lefts are going to fume over them, no matter if Muller calls names, and he knows that.

I guess in your opinion I also need a more serious username :D.

Yes, I see somewhat that I misrepresented that the Grand Jury immediately charges, rather the DA charges and the Grand Jury decides whether the trail is legitimate as enough evidence has been brought forward. 
But that is detail and doesn't change the overall angle of my comment: these individuals are charged to go through due process and defend themselves against the evidence that has been brought forward proving their crimes.

I don't get your comment. The Grand Jury charges the individuals with these actions, aka it says it has enough evidence to believe these individuals to be worthy of a charge. Of course they are not going to publicly disclose their evidence before trial, but the defendants lawyers will have absolutely the right to see evidence. The individuals can defend themselves in court and give proof otherwise or question existing evidence. If the evidence turns out to be insufficient, the charges will not withstand a trial.

Haha, breath man, relax, I am just messing with you. I am sometimes ignorant, just about as much as anyone else. First evidence: I didn't understand that your first comment wasn't replying to me but to BitAlt xD.
