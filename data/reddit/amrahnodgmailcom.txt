Nobody is asking for your sympathy. As as stated before I recall my rate being somewhere between 15-20% which I’m ok with. However 40% was not on there. Also it states on my receipt that I have .0416 btc. Which accounts for the exchange rate. I’m asking if this is an error on their part and or if it’s happen to anyone else. So how about you read the message in its entirety before you start painting a false narrative.

Honestly... you’re right! I’m an advocate for confirmation. Even if it’s me getting screwed. I atleast know that I did and will never use bitcoin atm again.

My receipt says  cash tendered 500 bitcoin purchased .04162851  alongside transaction ID. ..... i think I just figured it out! For some reason mycelium thinks .0416 btc is 291 dollars! I switched it from cash to BtC and it looks like I got my near 500 dollars back. So it wasn’t the atm but the application ����‍♂️

Nope... I used mycelium and just before transferring, it said I only had about 290 in the wallet. I’m glad I have my receipts and transaction ID because I really feel it glitched

Rockitcoin was the ATM

I did look at it. I have deposited before and normally I’m out 10-15 percent. But that’s damn over 40% ��

I never had any issues with them before. Just this time. I’ve used the atm before. Hell I could have been ok with them taking 20% but something is up. I thought maybe they are holding some portion of it for verification, but that sounds very bankish. Suspect
