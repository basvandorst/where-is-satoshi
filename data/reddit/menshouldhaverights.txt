Bitcoin is not a bubble, bitcoin is **IN** a bubble. All assets that are traded long enough go through bubbles. Bitcoin is just a new market and an information technology making it's price moves especially dramatic.

Moving the goal posts are we?
I'm not giving away market research for free on investments. If you seriously think there aren't other blockchains with serious and amazing active development teams that are comparable to bitcoins current devs, you are mistaken.
Go check out  there are thousands of coins. I'm sure you will find quite a few with very active dev teams.
Besides that, github commits are arbitrary in size so more commits doesn't necessarily mean very much depending on the project.
@_date: 2018-01-08 16:36:13


How so? In the context of the previous comments I would consider changing **"Which other coins have active devs and second layers?" to which projects have more recent git commits than bitcoin is moving the goal posts quite far because I never claimed that to be the case because it's not the best metric to begin with.** With that said there are many projects that have similar number of commits over that last few months as bitcoin so even by moving the goal posts the argument still isn't very strong.


I would agree with 95% being shit or straight up scams right now. But I think there will be many more than 30 coins that are legitimate projects that provide real world value to people in the next 5 years. I think most people, even in crypto right now are seriously underestimating the impact of blockchain tech on our society and financial markets in the long term but at the same time overestimating the short term impact if that makes sense. Hence the current bubble.
@_date: 2018-01-07 17:54:53
Which is perfectly reasonable given that bitcoin is technologically stagnant when it comes to blockchain innovation.

Assuming that you have extra cash laying around and no outstanding debt (other than maybe a mortgage), I would say you should have at least 5% of your networth/income in crypto and maybe half of that specifically in BTC. And to BE LONG BITCOIN, don't expect to touch the money for at least 5 years.
As much as I want to tell my friends to do their own research and blablabla if I'm being honest, over the 4 years I've been in BTC I've become convinced that blockchain/bitcoin is the future and will probably outpace almost any other investment over the next 10 years.

So why not setup support groups for male nurses too? Or support groups for female garbagemen? Hell, why not support groups for white NBA players while we're at it? Since we are going to divide people up by identity.
I think western society could focus on a lot more productive things than identity, like actual engineering problems. Any rationally acting capitalist organization, doesn't care what your genitals are if you can perform nor will they tolerate employee abuse if they actually want to keep good people.

Satoshi "Hey lets make an untraceable digital currency using advanced cryptography and encryption so no one can know, nor needs to know our identity because it will be a decentralized trustless system. Oh and I'm going to be completely anonymous myself."
Feminist "Hey, look at me I'm going to be as loud as I can so you know exactly what gender and race I am, being as specific about my identity as possible. Because that's what really matters when it comes to software engineering."
Ahh, I've seen a few "feminists in blockchain" start to pop up recently. They are in for a rude awakening when they find out that none of their tactics to inject identity politics will work in something like bitcoin. The free market don't got anytime for feminists.

This guy either doesn't understand the difference between currency speculation and traditional "investing" or he didn't do his research.
Blockchains can harbor almost any financial instrument including new ones that never existed before. I mean there are several cryptocurrencies, for lack of a better term, that are actually just securities that do pay dividends. I mean just look at kucoinshares for example.
So buying "cryptocurrencies" != currency speculation, at least some of it is legitmit investing. There is and will continue to be "traditional" investment vehicles that are put on a blockchain. And bitcoin will likely bet the backbone to the this new crypto economy.

Step 2: go to a country where some of its cities have the highest murder rates in the world and is on the brink of collapse and/or possibly genocide.
@_date: 2018-02-02 12:31:06


So that is wrong on a few different levels. It's not that easy to quantify "bitcoin as payment" as there are plenty of platforms that handle off chain transactions. Secondly it assumes that trading and using as a store of value (at least in the crypto space) are not legit forms of payment and usage somehow. It literally has $30 billion of daily trading volume not even touching payment for goods and services, the volume of daily bitcoin usage is definitely not $3 million like they suggest. 
What a retarded premise.
@_date: 2018-04-09 15:28:01
Or maybe they used Cambridge analytica and determined there was a lot of negative sentiment towards them in the crypto sphere.
Thus they use that to their advantage by scarring people away and shaking the week hands so they can buy at a lower price before the stock market completely crashes.

I understand why they would blanket ban all cryptocurrency stuff, but you think that if it was purely because of fraud that they would white-list some companies like coinbase.

There are clearly many many reasons why you would want that.
Maybe ask kevin O'Leary who's about to do a security token ico or any number of the many projects that already are doing security tokens.
This is similar to  asking why bitcoin is better than gold/fiat. I mean your fiat currently works just fine right? So why make the switch?

Because people are dumb and like simple stories to explain strange events, on top of people being super sour about the recent downtrend and were playing the market short.
There could be hundreds of tiny factors that led to the sudden move that just came together at once by pure chance. People aren't comfortable with complete randomness and complexity. In fact events like this should be expected to happen occasionally.
Crying "MARKET MANIPULATION" is the modern equivalent of blaming the gods for the hurricane that just destroyed your village. It's much easier on the psych than to accept that a a series of events that started with a butterfly flapping its wings would ultimately destroy everything you know.
@_date: 2018-04-09 18:49:52
Absolutely, that might even happen first, stocks will become traditional stocks and tokens on blockchains at the same time. Kind of like how there is dual blockchain tokens like KIN for example. Same token but it runs on stellar and ethereum.
Many opportunities that all these moon kids and bitcoin maximaliste are missing. Even if bitcoin becomes the single world currency, there is still going to be many other financial instruments!

It's the total value of all the cryptocurrency not just bitcoin that is less than 1%.
And yes, if you believe blockchains will replace all currency and financial instruments it should be a much higher percentage no?

To counter that, if mtgox estate gave all their bitcoins to their rightful owners tomorrow, do you really think that people who had tens or even hundreds of BTC in 2013 and suddenly got it back wouldn't sell right away? especially because we are in a bear market. I think that would be a lot more damaging to the price if there was a sudden increase in supply like that.
Also, if I'm not mistaken the trustee has been selling BTC in roughly the same amount consistently for years and nothing has changed recently. So I don't think it's really a reason for this downturn. 
@_date: 2018-04-09 17:50:42
I never claimed bitcoin was a stock. At best it's a currency.
But I am claiming blockchains will replace the stock market as there are several security tokens that already exist and that pay dividends, they are stocks on a blockchain. There are also new combinations and types of securities that never existed before that are being experimented with. Kevin O'Leary is going to be involved in a 0.5 billion dollar ico with a token that I believe gives you some time of equity in the business. ( and these are **NOT** utility tokens)
Why will businesses and startups chose security tokens over traditional IPOs? Because you can raise hundreds of millions of dollars in hours and in the long run probably have a bigger market capitalization too because the barrier to entry is a computer with internet which gives them access to a way larger global market.
@_date: 2018-04-27 11:54:26
Because exchanges will probably take over the role of banks in society IMO. 
@_date: 2018-04-12 17:32:29
True. But if you want to take a look at these ["experts" past performance and how many erroneous predictions they have towards BTC]( they are probably wrong and couple that with the actual history of bitcoin tells us that it is likely to break the ATH again within 5 years.
At this point bitcoin never reaching another ATH seems like it's the more unlikely scenario and is an extraordinary claim that should require extraordinary evidence.
@_date: 2018-04-09 18:54:45
Lol I wasn't giving out advice nor was I saying bitcoin would replace any non-currency financial instruments. That's silly. 
Newsflash blockchains(and there tokens) can be and are used for other instruments like stocks not just currency.
@_date: 2018-04-09 18:26:02
Definitely, I also think fiat currency will all be replaced by crypto too. But I just think everyone in crypto is too focused on currency when there's a whole economy of assets that can be replaced and entirely new ones created.

The difference is that the constitution(s) do not purport to have perfect laws ordained in a perfect text by an omniscient god who should have known the future and could have mentioned it in said text if it was going to be an issue. The men who wrote the constitution knew they were only men.
The constitution is amendable and their laws can be changed to include cryptocurrency.  All the major religious texts are not amendable. 
Do Muslim scholars have to deem every new piece of fintech as halal? Did they do that with paper notes? Polymer notes? How about bank cards? Online banking?
Either it wasn't a big enough issue for god to mention it or god wasn't any better at predicting the future than the average guy at the time of text (because he isn't real). You don't get a free pass on post-hoc explanations if you are claiming the author of the laws was a super intelligence outside of time itself.
@_date: 2018-04-10 13:49:07
Honestly nowadays you can probably keep them mostly separate anyways, or have 1 way flows of cash out of the bank into crypto.
With crypto debit and credit cards becoming increasingly more available you shouldn't even really need banks, other than for things that are still ill-adapted to the new (crypto) economy like credit scores and maybe insurance. But I think articles like these are mostly FUD, and even if they are true I think banks will have to start changing their tune in the next year or two.
@_date: 2018-04-09 16:32:12
You really don't think securities and stocks will migrate to blockchains eventually? It's literally already happening. (Wasn't saying bitcoin itself would replace stocks)

Yep you just summarized bitcoin/cryptocurrency perfectly.
Most people argument against bitcoin is "too risky " which they mean volatile. Volatility will decrease with time as the market becomes thicker. It's still tiny AF.
And I think people forget that bitcoin, even at current price is still the best performing currency of this decade and maybe of all time. And I'm willing to bet it will be for the next as well.

Nope, [gold rises during stock crashes](
Bitcoin has never existed during a crash, so if it's truely better than gold like a lot of people say, you better hold on to your ass. Of course if people are literally starving they will sell their assets for food, but that doesn't mean the price of those assets won't rise during that time.
@_date: 2018-04-09 18:14:28
As I've stated several times in this thread already, my argument assumes that bitcoin is gold 2.0 albeit a much more volatile version of gold, but that it will perform similarly to gold and increase in value as gold has during almost every stock market crash.

Robert Shiller needs to read black swan.
Not that bitcoin won't have many bubbles as all assets do, but seriously all these economists are going to look retarded in a few decades. Even more so than previous generations of "experts" who made terribly wrong predictions about the future because we have the internet thoroughly documenting their close-minded dogmatic opinions on things they don't understand.
Bitcoin has continued to not only grow but thrive for nearly a decade, how many decades will it take for Shiller to change his opinion?

right... if it's such common knowledge and manipulation is easy to spot that should create many opportunities for traders to take advantage of the manipulators strategy and profit therefore canceling out the effects or at least making it difficult to manipulate no?
Occams razor tells us that the most likely scenerio is some rich guy or a bunch a rich guys(like one of the dozens of professional firms now trading crypto) put in a buy order that exceeded the liquidity of the market at that moment creating more demand than supply.
