I'm a libertarian and there is nothing that would upset a libertarian.
Please do elaborate. "Wealthy Investors" are admired as part of the backbone of the free market economy by libertarians. 
I swear there are so many anti-social reddit philosophers who work at Panera while taking Sociology 101 classes on the weekend it astounds me.

Immigrants and a lot of latin and middle eastern countries love BB. They are huge BB Pin users.

I always take a second to giggle when highly educated, brilliant human beings are themselves confounded by the true simplicity of economics. They tend to point out how macroeconomics this, macroeconomics that; empiricism this, empiricism that; positivism this, positivism that;
That doesn't go without saying that there are cliched libertarian teenagers posting memes on on a daily basis, but that point is null in critiquing Bitcoin or Libertarianism since I could find 10x that amount with people like Krugman and the rest of the new-keynesians.
Intellectuals and society... :)
