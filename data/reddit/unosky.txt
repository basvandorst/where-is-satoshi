Hopefully mempool is cleared after the panic

The UI is great. The app is light weight. I have been using blockfolio for 2 years, but they don't have address tracking.
I'll gradually shift to this one now. Amazing work.

@_date: 2017-12-29 06:12:17
It is not?!?!
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:06:57
Also the electricity consumption is a problem
@_date: 2017-03-23 16:25:31
Why don't ppl just use paper wallets?
@_date: 2017-03-15 11:46:37
What if some segwit miners shut down for a while? BU will get the majority, and hardfork. The miners can resume running core and we will have 2 chains. People and exchanges can choose which chain's assets they like to use. At least the fees and congestion will drop!
@_date: 2017-03-13 20:59:38
Even after segwit activates, wont we eventually need a hardfork for further scaling in the future? (BTC noob here)
@_date: 2017-03-15 15:13:24
This sub is full off segwit supporters. r/btc is full of BU supporters
@_date: 2017-08-09 20:21:36
Ltc should have implemented it by now. 
@_date: 2017-08-03 10:56:58
That's not always true. Again, this involves a lot of micro decisions. What would happen for someone who decided to hodl their Yahoo stock? Now we know that they should have got bought about by Google long back
@_date: 2017-08-14 13:46:10
You can spend it when it becomes a globally accepted currency with a steady value
@_date: 2017-08-15 05:41:47
Buy dash

They have to be taught that. Rhe pointers will be completely different. And they have learnt to spot outnof experience.
@_date: 2017-08-24 13:59:11
Thanks. Any site where I can look up the live average transaction fees of he hour or something like that?
@_date: 2016-11-12 15:45:11
My family too is happy coz my crypto investments have doubled in value in less than a year
@_date: 2016-11-12 20:33:28
Yeah we can. People are well educated to point out counterfeits. Sometimes they creep in, but it's rare.
@_date: 2016-11-12 15:43:34
I thought of that but there is a limit to exchange. You need an id to exchange and can't go.more than twice a week. Plus the queue is dreadful. No one would stand for someone else until their cash is exchanged
@_date: 2016-12-24 10:26:54
Paper wallets are great too
@_date: 2017-08-24 12:26:01
When I can expect the fees to drop to a $0.1 or lower?
@_date: 2016-11-12 15:41:03
But local vendors and shopkeepers don't accept USD. Though they know the exchange rate- they can't say if the usd cash is counterfeit. 
@_date: 2016-12-24 10:56:07
Yeah sure.
A paper wallet has just 2 things, your public key and your private key. You can generate one easily. I recommend bitaddress.org
A print out or pdf of the keys is your paper wallet. It must not be shared or disclosed to anyone. Whenever you want to add money to the wallet, show the sender the public key.
But to spend from a paper wallet you will need to use another app or web wallet. So I recommend to use a paper wallet only as storage and not for spending. Keep a copy of it.
Visit bitaddress.org

Easy to look at it in hindsight and evaluate. The truth is, you made the best decision you could from the information you had. That's the best one can do.
@_date: 2017-11-01 16:03:55
Not necessary. Eventually everything will be dealt in satoshis
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:57:45
I still collect some Satoshi every day. I have been collecting for about 2 years. 
@_date: 2017-04-16 15:48:56
I have a copy too
@_date: 2017-04-09 07:00:34
Store your currency on a paper wallet
Give a copy of it to your wife 
@_date: 2017-04-16 03:23:30
I have given my parents the private keys handwritten. 
@_date: 2017-04-13 16:07:52
Why not?
@_date: 2018-03-01 15:40:54
Paper wallets too. Free and simple. Make sure you take precautions while creating them 
@_date: 2018-02-13 19:01:02
Don't sell unless you're profiting. Wait for a week, a month or more. It'll recover.
I usually look at weeks price and buy. A good sign is a horizontal line on the chart for a week and positive sentiment in mainstream media. That's when you buy.
@_date: 2017-09-06 19:47:31
I found this. 
It's pretty neat but assumes transactions to be of 250 bytes.
@_date: 2018-02-13 11:50:05
I see the number of unconfirmed transactions has fallen. I think the right terminology is mempool
@_date: 2018-02-13 19:14:36
Potential meme
@_date: 2017-10-23 13:56:11
Probably dash 
@_date: 2016-10-15 06:26:00
I think you need some minimum confirmations before transacting. Poloneix waits for 120
@_date: 2016-10-14 18:38:03
Can you transfer now?
@_date: 2016-10-15 06:26:46
Try not to keep your funds in a 3rd party wallet though. Use a paper wallet
@_date: 2016-10-14 16:59:31
I use coincap.io
@_date: 2016-10-14 16:48:53
I got into bitcoin because of All India Bakchod
@_date: 2017-05-15 06:56:20
Why is "Who Lives With His Parents" a part of the title? 
Edit: spelling
@_date: 2017-05-16 05:36:58
How does that make me Nazi?
@_date: 2016-05-04 12:53:17
But it should've been Googled a lot more after 2010
@_date: 2016-05-15 21:57:17
Adults in my family think it's some kind of gaming and drug money. And my friends ridicule it by calling it 'buttcoin'. I laugh along because their reaction would be priceless when it takes off.
@_date: 2016-07-09 16:50:41
The next blocks is gonna take time until 422016
@_date: 2016-07-10 04:29:55
Haha yeah! Anti-climatic
@_date: 2017-06-28 08:47:56
Coinsecure.in is also good, in terms of price
@_date: 2017-06-28 08:38:44
You mean something like this
