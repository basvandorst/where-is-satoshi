That's pretty cool, bookmarked OSMC!

If you'd like to make the case, we're having a related discussion in our Assembly community right now:

We decide which version comes shipped with Bitseed but the user can download and install any software they want, at it's core it's just an open source Linux server that runs some scripts to automate full node deployment.

We are still making and shipping v1 from the shop. New features include:  
* Enclosed case design  
* Improved web interface  
* Better node management tools

The server is open source, anyone can download any software they want for it. It will just not be as easy to use unless you know how to modify the scripts that make it "plug and play."
If you have any suggestions you'd like to share to improve the product, you can join our Assembly community and contribute to the dialogue there:

RPi does not have a HDD, this comes with a 160GB HDD (with a free upgrade to 250GB through the end of this weekend!)

You seem skeptical - this is understandable and something we encourage, especially given the track record of pre-sales by bitcoin companies (though there are probably more happy endings than bad, the bad ones have been really bad).  
Crowdfunding is a legitimate fundraising method used by many successful companies (e.g. Pebble, Oculus, Canonical, etc) to gauge interest in the market and/or raise money for product development without having to sell out to investors.  
If you have any specific questions or concerns about our product or the pre-order process, we welcome you to ask here or [send us a message]( through our website. Cheers!

Seems like only yesterday that it was just a little genesis block!

We have scripts on the device to automate node deployment (the device is "plug and play," though you may need to open a port on your router if it doesn't support UPnP). There is also a UI for node monitoring/ management, which we are working on improving for Bitseed v2.

Thank you for your review, Matt! Glad to see you're enjoying your Bitseed :)

We don't have an official stance as a company, but I personally will support a block size increase if it doesn't mess with miner incentives and doesn't irreparably damage decentralization of the bitcoin network. This product is in part a response to the fact that regardless of block size, the blockchain will continue to become more inconvenient for people to manage on mobile phones or laptops.

We will provide a relatively easy way to upgrade if a critical bug is fixed in a future version of bitcoind. Other than that, the version that ships with the device should be sufficient for quite some time.


It's not as bad as downloading a large torrent file or something like that, but if you are connecting to a bunch of nodes or have another node requesting a large amount of info from your node then it could cause a spike in bandwidth. We are working on ways for our customers to limit these kinds of spikes. Stay tuned!
