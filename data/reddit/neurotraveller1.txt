You can easily buy Bitcoin off the Abra app and they are going be implementing Segwit soon.

The Ethereum team talks of developing a platform for 10,000 currencies. As soon as they have a working model how soon will it be before another team replicates it with their own platform of ten thousand currencies and on and on. And what's to stop it at ten thousand. Why not a million currencies.  This looks like inflation on steroids. It looks like a total mess. I believe simplicity is congruent with greater wholeness which is what Bitcoin is trying to achieve. A oneness which is decentralized. Projects like Etherium may wind up leading to severe fragmentation. Do we really want to live in a world where each city is using completely different and multiple currencies? I think that anything that works with the Bitcoin  Blockchain and adds value to it is they way to go.

A black swan economic event in a 1st world country will shoot the price up several thousand dollars within a very short period of time. It's not a question of if but a question of when. I would follow Zero Hedge, Bitcoin Warrior, or Jesse Colombo.

Here's an excellent Bitcoin tv add right here. It's not on tv yet. I don't know how to get it there except to support Pheeva Wallet.

I hope they can totally restructure and stay in business if only to pay out all the so called stolen or lost coins.

Doge and most of its ilk will be killed off by the Bitcoin 2.0 protocols and blockchain alts like Mastercoin, colored coins, etc..

This period was predicted 4 months ago. It brings hope.

Gary North is the guy who convinced thousands of people that the world was going to come to an end due to the millennium bug. But nothing happened and a lot of people lost a lot of money after buying survivalist supplies. He was kicked off national radio for a long time. His opinions are useless.

This is not true. He posted this photo as part of a Twitter back and forth with Bitcoin Baby who was soliciting nude photos for Bitcoin back during the large spike of Fall 13'. I commented on their feed. I guess I know a little secret Bitcoin history. But it's no big deal.

A Gary Johnson presidency will boost prices. He's accepting Bitcoin right now. Trump could easily decide to attack the Bitcoin ecosystem based upon things he has said against encryption and the internet.

This civilization can not be reformed. It must be broken away from. Bitcoin can be the currency of a breakaway civilization.

Bitcoin can go to $50,000 within 6 months. If Deutsche Bank fails it would cause a domino effect of bank failures throughout the entire euro zone. The ECB simply does not have the money to bailout the entire European Union banking sector. They would be forced to do a full bail in. At that point millions of people would be seeking safety in Bitcoin and also as a means of revolt against our fiat banking system.

You think Bitcoin is an MLM or a pyramid scheme? You don't have any idea what open source software is do you? In a ponzi scheme there absolutely no transparency.

Somehow I think Bitcoin has a greater destiny with Japan than with China. When the name Satoshi Nakamoto was chosen I think it was a thoughtful decision. Not a name pulled out of a hat.

You still haven't gotten your head around what a deflationary currency in limited supply that cant be stopped means.

It's good that Chinese interest in Bitcoin has slowed down. It's giving the world time to catch up. China was on course to be the  Bitcoin country. Now that wont happen because they can't innovate with it much. So they will only be the top mining country. The 1st country to fully adopt Bitcoin will become a superpower. Even if its a small country.

Government will not dissapear because of any cryptocurrency. But they will be forced to cede power.
