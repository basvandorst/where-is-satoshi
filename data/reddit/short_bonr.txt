I said nothing of the blockchain, I get it and agree with the concept but my question was...Bitcoin

I ran a web based business for over a decade...the grand I blew on my PC and upgrades, software, etc provided the value - which made my paper money. What can 1 BTC do for me? How can I utilize it any moreso than paper currency whereas my computer enabled me to do more?

I did not know this....I was always under the impression you were assigned a QR code or a hash. mac id of sorts, HEX code or whatnot...which would make it seemingly impossible to retrieve should something go awry.

$100 billion....of....fiat value

You've got mail...the subject mentions cheap viagra - click the link to get the guitar (some assembly required) 
I'm still questioning where the value is...and what gives it such as well as the basis of its value itself.

Actually - yes, I get where you're coming from but again I have to argue the tangibility. Gold, artwork, cards, are all physical - and affected by scarcity and demand, whereas dogecoin, he-man coin, garbage pail coins, could all be easily forgotten and devalued overnight. Wallets can be lost, USB's accidentally exposed to a magnet or whatever...and lost without a trace.

I have an air-guitar that was used by Jimmy Hendrix at Woodstock - I was going to put it on E-Bay but I'll sell it to you for just $400...deal? You can carry it anywhere undetected...scan it and email it too. Play it anywhere instantly.

The masses also collected "Beanie Babies" - doesn't mean I could trade one for a Mercedes at any point

Actually, I am trying to wrap my head around it before investing a chunk of change in it...still waiting for that $400 BTW

I'm a skeptic by nature, lost too much too many times to not be. Thanks for the info -

So, there's 100,000 copies of my "profile" stored? That all must be congruent? And please clarify "on a metal" - so I need a QR code laser engraved to access them? I'm confused...

The King, Prime Minister, IRS, governments, banks, whatnot still regulate my home and properties and can legally still take them...if my form of currency is not acceptable to them.

Gold is tangible, malleable, used in jewelry as well as the electronics that you are currently using!! It has a usage - a purpose.

Theoretically - I found an old USB stick in a box of Misc I purchased at a yard sale...I tried 8 different PC's...none could read or open the "drive" - How is that a "store" of value? It could have had coins on it...like the owner claimed
