Mighty inconsistent of you.

These two words make me cringe so fucking hard. Faux-ghetto twitter lingo is really neat.

"It can enhance transactions between buyers and sellers. It can actually help Internet and national trade." - Sounds like he kinda *gets it*. More of this, please. 
@_date: 2014-02-26 10:28:43
This sounds pretty damn sensible. 
@_date: 2017-02-08 12:34:39
Oh, i like you...

Decent write up for any starter. Look into spacing the topics out quite a bit. Class it up with some imagery. Link sources of key-concepts within the text.

Only if they're for my perennial area and all natural stickers, made from real, 100% organic sticks.

Congrats. Enjoy your time. If coinbase would ever verify my identity and let me access my coins, I'm in the 5 figure club... It isn't much but I want access to my shit. They are asking for a class action lawsuit.

Nah, it's illegal to steal money, Rico sauve. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 11:27:29
With that kind of (what I'm assuming is) new wealth, they're being smart. Letting things play out, having some diversification and enjoying life. I'd be looking for a top-notch financial advisor and lawyer but to each their own; at least they're not blowing it at a casino.

Let's get to work.

Does abra sell gluten free alpaca-milk on the side or some shit? Fuck that snake-oil peddling scag.
@_date: 2017-08-13 12:05:59
Haha. I'm retarded.
@_date: 2016-11-09 04:11:18
And India! This should be interesting.
@_date: 2017-08-13 12:08:23
That would be so nice. I still want my five figures.
@_date: 2016-11-11 07:14:32
Pray on
@_date: 2017-04-01 13:54:20
You've transcended. 
@_date: 2017-09-21 00:04:36
That's if they pick up. I just waited a half hour before they cut me off because it's 5 o' clock. What a company.
@_date: 2017-09-04 09:56:34
I think/hope they're being sarcastic. Either way, it's silly shit.
@_date: 2017-05-25 10:18:53
For months? No.
@_date: 2017-05-09 06:44:21
If I was terminal, I'd take risks, too. Good luck, man. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 10:25:00
It's been months and I've received nothing but canned bullshit. It's fucking unacceptable.
@_date: 2017-06-09 13:36:49
That's funny.
@_date: 2017-06-09 14:06:42
Seriously. I've taken to just asking to verify my identity but I just keep getting canned responses. It really feels like I've been robbed.
@_date: 2017-06-05 02:48:08
I've been trying to get anything but a canned response from them for at least 6 months. They have over 6000$ of mine and I'll have my banks verifications of the transactions. Sign me up! I'm fucking livid about it. 
@_date: 2017-06-09 13:44:51
I never received any 2FA codes from coinbase or authy and now they're wanting google authentication but i cant even get into my account to enable it because it wants an authy code. Six months of this shit is me underestimating, really but I'm trying not to flip the fuck out. I have all documentation from my bank and all their emails. This shit isn't just happening to me and with the amount of money involved, they can't fucking get away with this. There's another person working on a suit and has a ton of people getting involved but that's going to take too god damn fucking long. 
@_date: 2017-06-10 01:25:30
Nice assumption, asshat.
