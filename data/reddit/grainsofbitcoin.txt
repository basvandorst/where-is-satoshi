Glad this is getting more attention than my proof of stake comment about proof of burn. It does deserve its own thread. 
I think it would have to implemented on an alt coin before bitcoin could really evaluate it. But, I don't see how it could work during the initial coin ramp period, so we are left with a chicken egg scenario. However, it is conceivable that an eventual switch to proof of burn would offer a solution to the energy requirements of proof of work, avoid the pitfalls of proof of stake, and perhaps gaurentee long term security even after block rewards become mainly about transaction fees

You could tell the same parable with proof of work. 
Hey, this is truly what happened. Don't believe me? I'll run a marathon to prove it. 
Am I telling the truth? Or am I an idiot for working so hard to make a point?
Just saying,  I think your parable is a straw man.

If you are such a bitcoin skeptic, why do you post here so much? Not that it's not appreciated to have someone to push from the other side, but doesn't it get old from your perspective, always batting down those clueless and pesky bitcoiners?

Why aren't miners switching already to smaller pools? .5% of hash rate gets you 1 block per day. Miners should be dividing themselves into pools of 1 % of hash rate. 
Can we get a miner who is part of a large pool to comment on we they aren't moving?

Richard brown offers a good approach to the 'Bitcoin as a technology' camp. You might find it interesting. He touches on the concept of colored coins.

The real solution here is to change the tip interface. For example, if tip total just shows up next to a post like up votes you can tip to your heart's content and all the post gets is a higher number. 
Unfortunately, changetip could not implement such a feature on reddit. 
Reditt themselves could do so though, or a site could build a reddit clone based on tips instead of up votes

Bitcoin might enable the principles of Islamic banking, ie, shared equity arrangements to replace debt. 
When it comes to buying, you are essentially looking at a high tech version of rent-a-center. (Hopefully a far better deal too.) with smart contracts, full ownership of the asset would pass to the consumer over time. Failure to pay could result in the seller somehow disabling part of the product, with embedded smart contracts
If Bob wants a business loan, he might find in a bitcoin denominated world that selling equity will do just fine. He could even crowd source an equity sale to his target market of customers, thereby creating a loyal cluster of customers/evangelists/investors.
The death of fractional reserve does not mean the death of finance.
However, it is also possible that modern 'banks' could continue to operate 'as is' if bitcoin eventually stabilizes

Right. And the Winklevii will buy every sell order &lt; 40 K too. Because anyone who has a price target also has infinite resources

How many coins moved that day?

This could be a way to break the ios log jam. What if a service allowed you download convenient denominations of bitcoin. Then passbook would be like carrying a real wallet of bitcoin bills. When you pay, an app could scan several bills to get to the right amount. Each pass would have a change address. Ideally you would not spend much more than the total amount, but you would have to trust the merchant to send the change

One could argue that is what happens if Bitcoin succeeds. (The currency, not the protocol). But, if the currency succeeds, the protocol remains, and could be the means for yet another 'currency revolution' if the early adopters are not responsible with the 'new world' they build. 
In fact, this is the one thing that makes me most skeptical of bitcoin the currency. How strong are the network effects for a currency with such top heavy distribution, when a new one can be created in a day.
@_date: 2014-01-12 18:48:47
In a cryptocurrency world, the risk I think, is that highly concentrated wealth reduces the power of the network effects. This opens the door for disruption by a more equally distributed competitor. 
If people can choose which currency that they can use to store wealth, use as a medium of exchange, promote, etc, it would seem they have to have some level of stake in its continued success. If 100 people control most of the wealth of bitcoin, this actually could prove problematic in the long run.
The early adopter composition also matters. Do you really want Max kaiser to be a trillionaire if Bitcoin became the world reserve currency? You might say, 'we'll, no, but he was an early adopter." But somehow, you have to win the middle and late adopters. 
The more wealth controlled by the corrupt, the more risk of a 'revolution'.

So if you think the store of value/currency piece will never work, what about colored coins and smart contracts? 
These could mean the Bitcoin tokens go to zero, but the block chain remains a viable innovation. Is the blockchain also lame to you?

Perhaps proof of burn instead...

I think 10 k per year goes a lot further where he lives than In the West. This comment is ignorant. 
10 k per year is probably a solid income in Indonesia.

Hypothetically, could you hedge by holding a certain amount of bitcoin to use for returns processing?
Of course you then assume some exchange risk downside, but as a major retailer, this should be a small portion of your balance sheet

I thought I had read that Gyft kept at least some BTC they receive via sales. Is this inaccurate or did you originally launch with 100 % liquidation?

Yet it is easier to think of bitcoin as existing in the real world because it's name implies mass
Also, I would see the fact that grains do not thought of as Hundredths per say, to be an easier way for people to accept grains as 'the real bitcoin'. 
Some have proposed a name change to call .01 or .001 bitcoin to just be called bitcoin. Like a stock split. I don't think the history of our present bitcoin unit would allow for that. Smaller implied units of an implied commodity/currency seem more likely

Did you see the you tube video above? Or the stop watch analogy? 
1 bitcoin spent, acquired yesterday: 1 day destroyed.
1 bitcoin spent, acquired 1000 days ago: 1 thousand days destroyed.
So, lots of real old coins moved, and they moved in smaller transactions

Only psychology and marketing. How many commenters do we have that say newbies are scared of the $200 price, even though the unit price is meaningless compared to total market value. 
But milibit is not very approachable. I think the micro prefix feels natural, given the number of uses in culture (Microsoft, Microwave, microscope, etc.) plus, we are used to dividing money in hundredths, not thousandths.  
$100, 1 dollar, 1 penny etc. people don't think in thousandths, and no one is talking about centibitcoin, in part because the name is unapproachable.
@_date: 2013-12-22 01:49:42
We are both seeing the same transaction but I think we are both wrong. These coins are only 7 days old in this address. 
That's half a million days destroyed, not 100 million, like the chart shows

Okay, well try this as an experiment: Explain bitcoin subunits to a newbie and use centibitcoin as an example. Then explain it to someone with 'grains of bitcoin'. See which one 'gets it'. 
It's not the metric system it's the name. Bitcoin could become a household word. Could milibitcoin? Do we have lots of metric system derived names in our products around the world?
If Bill gates was leading the charge on bitcoin he might agree with you? Steve jobs? Not a chance.

Interesting. According to the site below, it does appear that about 30,000 addresses have 50 BTC. I suppose their age would help determine whether 2/3 I then could belong to Satoshi. Again though how is 20% of all BTC mined feasible?

What are you pointing to in this forum? I don't see anything relevant here.

I submitted a feature request to allow you to designate part of your balance as 'quasi cold.' The idea would be that you could not move that portion without a waiting period (7 days?) and multiple channels of notification. This essentially makes your quasi cold balance more like ach. An attack would have plenty of time to be identified and cancelled.
I haven't heard back on this request, but I feel like it would be really useful. Most users wont want to deal with cold storage, or figure out how to truly trust the computer you use to generate the private key.

The following looks like a good candidate for a large number of days destroyed. 64,700 coins moved. It looks like 8,000 went to an active wallet and the rest probably went to a new change address. Maybe an old timer cashed out 10 % to an exchange. (Just a theory). I don't know how to check the chain to see how old these coins are, but it would take a large transaction to destroy this many days. This is the largest transaction today by far.  I found it by looking here:
Edit: spelling
@_date: 2013-12-22 02:12:29
It matters because something 'different' just happened. Namely, a lot of really old coins moved. This blows the Silk Road seizure out of the water in 'days destroyed' magnitude. Moreover, there aren't enough large transactions to account for this. Either block chain.info's graph is wrong, or it seems like a lot of old coins with small balances moved. Satoshi, along with other early miners kept their coins in the original 50 coin output addresses from successful blocks. I don't know how to check, but my current theory is there were a bunch of really old block reward transactions that moved today. 
That or the chart has a bug. Seems to me that is the more likely outcome right now
