My understanding is that it will require a trusted third party until ops codes are updated/added (not entirely sure what those are).  My understanding is that requires a hardfork.  Which won't be a problem. /s

Do you mean a stable currency that rises 800% with many swings in a single year, or a stable currency like Ethereum, that hasn't been hacked, except that one time when a miner created a bunch of them out of nowhere?  Contracts themselves can and will be hacked on both systems.

But if btc is truly pegged to rsk, then why wouldn’t it impact the monetary supply?
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:21:46
We may both be thinking of "pegged" differently.  If a bunch of people lock rsk in a smart contract and that smart contract gets drained by a hacker, that hacker now has access to all the btc locked in a multisig that represents that rsk.  That would impact the monetary supply if the hack was large enough.  However, I'm not sure what happens to all the btc in a multisig if rsk were to get locked in a smart contract forever.   They shouldn't be able to claim that BTC as they have no proof of ownership.

If Bitcoin stagnates then one day the people who say Bitcoin is crashing for good may be right.  It may go down in value and other technologies will jump ahead.  That's all I mean.  Hopefully both sides come to an agreement and move forward before it's too late.

@_date: 2017-01-16 20:24:29
I disagree.  Digging your heels in and not compromising is a recipe for stagnation as that's what the other side will do =  nothing.  Small blocks feeds into the notion that Segwit will get implemented but that won't occur with zero compromise.  Blocks will stay small sure, but Segwit won't get implemented, the protocol won't be upgraded to handle capacity with small blocks.  Time stands still for no one, especially in crypto.  While this is going on other protocols are being considered, worked on, upgraded.  I wish the answer here was simple but it's not.

This!  Your opinion is more valid than the devs.  Delusion comes from those who think the end user should give a damn about how it works.  It just needs to work.  Average people don't understand any of this shit and the don't care. It's not your fault.

Your comment is ugly.  
@_date: 2017-01-16 18:57:22
Regardless what side you are on, you can't move forward until there is an agreement.  Without an agreement and some compromise, Bitcoin is dead in the water.  I think it's better to not argue for one side or the other but determine where the middle ground is.  If that can't be determined then expect a collapse.  Only then will one side be left with whatever is left and can move on from there.  However it may be too late at that point.

Because you are not letting anyone hold your bitcoins.  You retain the private keys on the Ethereum blockchain.  This is a trustless way to move BTC to Ethereum.   Tbtc has over collateralized eth backing it.  But there is no point, you aren't open to understanding these things.

Highly unlikely Ethereum becomes a “testnet” for Bitcoin.  Ask Etc how easy it was to copy/paste dapps from eth to etc.  Also, eth is actively making a bridge that will allow bitcoin on Ethereum as an erc20 token. This means wBtc will be pegged to a locked up btc.  I do think rsk will have interesting use cases for Btc, but with all the development on Eth, it becoming Btc’s testnet is delusional.

You forget about bitcoins rollback?  On 15 August 2010, the vulnerability was exploited; over 184 billion bitcoins were generated in a transaction, and sent to two addresses on the network. Within hours, the transaction was spotted and erased from the transaction log after the bug was fixed and the network forked to an updated version of the bitcoin protocol.

Yeah, that’s not how blockchains work.  Someone had to run the code that was created.  Those that didn’t like it forked away and are living the ETC dream.

Arguably you may be correct.  It allowed all the fundamentalist to separate from the pragmatists early thus creating a better Eth community.  Plus no one lost any money, provided they kept their tokens and didn't panic sell.  It was amazing for me as I got a shit ton of ETC and dump it on the market for a nice profit.

Ethereum is the leading smart contracts platform and gets all of the developer network effects.  Rootstock will need to develop their own dapps and that will take time.  If copy/paste was that easy, they would have had Rootstock operating by now. Its been 2 years since Ethereum launched and Rootstock is still on a testnet.
@_date: 2017-05-23 07:18:50
ETC thought the same way too. The problem is, while you may clone a smart contract, you can't clone the leadership behind the development, the company, the execution. Try copy/pasting Digix, it's really hard to copy/paste the gold that it's linked to.  Copy/paste GridX, it's really difficult to overlay a secondary protocol over a nations electric grid using copy/paste. Similar to the title of this post, Ethereum invites development and doesn't wish to kill Bitcoin or any other coin but work with everyone.  Zcash is an example of this. Zcash will be incorporated into Ethereum with the metropolis release.  They even built a BTCRelay for Bitcoin,which actually makes Ethereum a sidechain of Bitcoin but because maximalism, it won't be used. Edit: grammar
@_date: 2017-07-26 10:49:05
I find his summary that the SEC didn't try to prosecute because they could lose and it would be a free-for-all on the ICO market very much on point.  Instead of challenging any one ICO in court, they will ultimately try and enact laws that give the SEC clear authority over the market as a whole.  I would think this would provide a less heavy handed approach initially and allow for legitimate ICOs with a questionable token to come into compliance or else.  Doomsday scenarios would be disastrous for everyone involved.

You may not care for it, but that's not the point.  The point is that Eth is being used and done so in a way that people don't even realize they are using it.
@_date: 2017-05-31 18:44:01
If this happened to Eth, it would also happen to Btc as you are stating that you can defeat a cyptographic standard.  If you are someone who cares about cryptos in general, I'm not sure this is the best way to go about "winning."  Scare tactics can have adverse effects on the entire ecosystem.

I'm just not sure that the SEC coming in would be a doomsday scenario like most portray it.  They are supposed to be here to protect the investors.  Just blatantly telling all "ICOs" regardless of design that they are illegal and shutting all of them and even Ethereum down would hurt all of the investors.  Seems counter intuitive. If regulation comes, I would expect that ICOs are told to clean up their act and here are the rules/penalties going forward.  If they are already deemed a blatant security, they may have to refund any money back to token holders etc.  Those that don't comply would then face penalties.  No regulation and total annihilation by regulation are both extremes and a gray area, less heavy handed initial approach will probably be true.

No I didn't, don't put words in my mouth.
Also, Bitcoin is a mess, but it can be resolved.  There is no other industry out there with no competition.  Eth potentially overtaking Btc is actually a good thing as it lights a fire up under everyone's ass. Competition is a good thing and so is diversifying whether it's with Eth or any other "altcoin."
Edit:  Well, not just any other altcoin. Only a handful of good ones.
