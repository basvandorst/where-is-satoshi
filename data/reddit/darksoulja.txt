yea just a theory, but hard to know where these will be. I honestly don't know whats happening, but I dont think its anywhere near a bubble &amp; major crash yet, just investors who bought in early and met their target exit. If it keeps going up past $5k then its possible this was all just an orchestrated event by whales to exploit a probable correction to accumulate before some big news is about to launch values across the grid

You can do a wire transfer thru gdax (coinbase exchange) if done before 12pm pst it will fund by eob

If you dont have USDT (tether) assets on an exchange for these opportunities, coinbase has a feature to set up a bank transfer account from your checking/savings thats less expensive than a credit card. Now, new accounts start off with limited funding; the more you use them the more you can access. This is the extent of my experience

dumb money sold @ $4200 today. smart money sold @ $5k last night and a few bought back in @ $4200; a bunch of short-sighted smart money are now retiring, while a few forward-thinking smart money are now swing trading, accumulating BTC. It reaches a desirable price at some point then all investors chomping at the bit buy back in and set $10k as the new target selloff. rinse and repeat until BTC is worth far too much to fuck around with..
dumb money will regret it forever, short-sighted smart money will be indifferent, and forward thinking smart money will run the planet.
