The 50btc ‘hack’ happened when I was mining with 3 ASICs. It wasn’t that big a deal to lose 91btc at the time because I had hundreds of bitcoin anyway. I had it set to auto payout but the owners fucked off with everyone’s coin and led us on for a long time. They said they’d been hacked and we’d get our coin back but then they just disappeared. 
The mtgox loss was annoying because I sent 27btc to cash then out to my bank account right at the time they disabled withdrawals. I cancelled my fiat withdrawal and tried to get my coins out but it was too late. There is a small chance I will get a percentage of that back some time in the future as I have submitted a claim to the bankruptcy lawyers in Japan. 
This was back in like 2013-2014 so it’s only when I  reminded of these losses that I realise I would literally be a millionaire right now. 
Don’t get me wrong, I still did okay. Bought a couple of cars and had a few really long holidays... but if only I HODL’d then until now....

Doesn’t work on mobile which I use most often. I really wish I could delete my google ad profile. All I see is bitcoin/crypto ads everywhere I look. I can mostly avoid it otherwise.

Lily Allen was once offered 200,000btc for a gig. She declined.

Thanks for reminding me (no really). Bitcoin was only part of the story, and I’m well aware of my flaws. The major stresses are all in the past these days, but every time I see the mention of bitcoin it solicits a certain response from my brain. It was easy to avoid in the past but Bitcoin is everywhere now. I can’t even read the news without seeing a recommended article. 
I appreciate your response and I too think things will get better. Starting from where I am now is going to be much tougher but I’m starting to see a brighter future, albeit not the same future I used to look forward too. 
Learning about investing is right up my street so thanks for pointing me towards that!

Man I lost 91btc to 50btc.com back in the day. And another 27btc when mtgox went down. I really wish I could block all mention of bitcoin from reddit and the internet. It’s bad enough that all the google ads I get are for bitcoin/crypto because my search history for a long time was nothing but bitcoin. Drives me a little bit mental tbh.

Not likely. I’ve received a message back from the Japanese firm telling me the amount I claimed didn’t match their records. I don’t have an exact amount to give them. It was 91.2725616 or some shit. I’ve resubmitted the claim over and over and mailed them tracked letters in the post which they have received. Haven’t heard anything more from them. I still try though. 
Even if my claim is successful it won’t be for a while and would likely be around 20% of the actual amount. By then that will still be a lot of money but I’m not getting my hopes up.

When I got my first ASIC (Avalon batch  I was mining 12+ coins a day. Good times.

Damn that is pretty deep. There was a poster next to it for a bitcoin conference but I didn’t take a pic. I’ll check it out though when I next go past there.

Guy you seriously were never around for the sub $1 coins were you? There were faucets giving away 5btc for free each hour. If you bought bitcoin at a high price to try and make money then you’re a dummy.

Lost 91 coins to gox thanks for reminding me.

Nope. 
1. I don’t have a Mac
2. It starts with 5J and is certainly in a private key format.

Nope. I'm getting 'invalid private key encoding (code -5)' on all these suggestions. It's possible that I'm getting the part I'm covering with my hand wrong too though. Thanks for trying. I'm only going to keep trying this evening and then I'll probably just post the full smudged key. Like I said I doubt there is anything in the address... maybe a fraction of coin. But saying that a fraction of a coin is worth shit loads now... found £25 in an old LBC account earlier which I had left there because it was literally worth pennies at the time.

It will be a fun little experiment if you want too, I’m fairly confident there won’t be a balance. Confident enough to hand over the full (smudged) private key. I’ll give you a shout tomorrow. I’m off to bed...

I submitted a clam for the 17.27 bitcoins in my account. However I got the exact amount wrong and the claim was rejected. I have since found evidence, including screenshots of the exact amount but I get no response for the bankruptcy team. Is there anything I can do?
