Capital Gains Tax only applies if you have your coin for at least 1 year, otherwise it's just added to your income and taxed accordingly.
After 1 year, Capital gains is taxed at 0% for the lowest two income tax brackets, 15% for most tax brackets, and 20% for the highest bracket.

They're also changing the definition of a bank account to include crypto exchanges... don't think it says anything about HW wallets or even node wallets like Electrum.

I mean, I wouldn't call buying drugs unethical
@_date: 2017-11-22 00:54:51
Wire some cash to my international bank account and I'll hook you up good!

I guess certain drugs then, that's fair. I don't know many people hurt in the production of psychs either now that you mention it...

I would call 90% of street dealers trustworthy, especially if they get arrested

I'm pretty sure you won't be hauled off to jail for ubering in a banned area. Probably just a large fine.

They're always involved in laundering, eh?
@_date: 2017-10-09 22:39:38
It's okay, rationalizing your behavior is perfectly normal.

Prolly should have PM'd this to op...

On one hand, this just seems fake to me intuitively. It's a hunch, so 0 credibility, but something just seems off to this story.
On the other hand, I initially agreed with eqleriq's post, but once I read through it I thought nearly the same thing you did and realized that everything eqleriq pointed out as unlikely could actually make a rather plausible scenario.
For example: 


At first I agreed, thinking "only a true idiot would do such a thing", then I remembered how many completely idiotic firewall and other system configurations I've come across due to incompetent or under-informed IT, which is unfortunately quite common.
I don't know what to believe anymore.

True, this is the most expensive lesson in "only as strong as the weakest link" I've seen to date.

... and the fact that they had web access to the online wallet and not a hardware wallet prevents the theft because... ?
Sorry if I'm missing something, but I truly don't follow your reasoning here.
@_date: 2017-05-06 01:12:49
Well, blockchain.info has a bit of a history with security issues...

Wait, so were any funds seized?
