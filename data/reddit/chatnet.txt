 That is Roger and his narcissism.. keeping hold over bitcoin related marketing avenues.  Cheap scammy tactics all the way and leading by example. His primary tool is misinformation and propaganda tactics.  He does not understand the technical cs issues of large scale and doesn't care. It's him and his pals against bitcoin and no holds barred.  Then they blame the other side for "cheap" tactics like calling their scam vehicle bcash.  I might have held some bcash if not for the theatrics and scam tactics, but now it's up there with bitconnect in terms of reputation.  I have no use for obvious scams or buying something that supports scammers.  The bch crew is toxic to bitcoin .. Wu is acting against btc in mining policies and in favor of bch,  ver is damaging the reputation of bitcoin and bch via propaganda and misinformation using cybersquatting.  Csw is a clueless joke talking about history he doesn't know or understand,  constantly bragging about his education / credentials (a degree alone does not make you a bitcoin expert or world class at anything)..  apparent plagiarism... and bragging about having more money than a country.  Obviously he doesn't.  How can anyone with a clue follow such knuckle heads?  If you mine,  move to a pool besides btc.com and antpool (I use slush pool) as Jihan wu controls these and is against mining btc.  Hes very likely using btc profits to prop up bch.  If you have a convention, dont invite  scammers . Paying people to promote scams is unethical.. and giving them a platform to lie and spread ignorance about bitcoin slows bitcoin adoption .. thanks!
