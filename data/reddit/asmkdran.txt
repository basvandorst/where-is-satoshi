"A dollar a day keeps the panic away"?
Dollar cost averaging is a good idea. Maybe don't lock in your loss by changing your mind though? Is what you thought the other day still relevant today? You can always (at least on Coinbase / Gdax) put a sell limit order at a price you would be happy to sell at and it will automatically complete the order when the market gets there. Then again, you may be really happy you sold until you see it went higher up. Welcome to the emotional rollercoaster. There are probably about 100,000 others like you right now too with all the new Coinbase users that signed up.

That is incredibly mature and smart. Bravo to you! I applaud your security practices. Make sure you keep good physical security of your device and do a second device in a different location just to be safe. Especially if you have anything significant on those addresses. You could always do two different BTC wallets or just a clone.

Rob, fire, flood, kid throws it in the firepit, dog eats it. Keeping it under your pillow or in a sock drawer IS NOT physical security. Professionals like Coinbase have patented techniques to split a private key into multiple pieces that need to be combined to get it restored. Then they ship those off to each different continent. If you have anything valuable, or you think it could be valuable, treat it accordingly.

The more you pay the higher you are to moon, right?

It’s called a private key, but yes.

You're welcome, and don't second guess yourself =)
