I wonder what percentage of sizeable bitcoin owners just hold on to their bitcoins without looking at the price. I know if I owned a 1000 I would struggle not to look at the price given that my net wealth would be taking huge swings in value every day.
@_date: 2014-02-14 09:06:22
This volatility is pretty normal for bitcoin. 
At the moment the obvious answer to the drop in price would be the fact that the main exchange where you could buy and sell bitcoin has just stopped you taking your bitcoins out, and the current drop in price is speculation that they are insolvent and/or do not have the bitcoins they say they do.
@_date: 2014-03-03 15:30:31
Does anybody fully understand Bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-02-28 11:31:49
Well as long as Bitcoin keeps trending as it has in the past it should be up to 4k in a few months.
On the bright side at least you did not buy on mtgox.
@_date: 2014-03-06 09:45:21


It has not proven to solve that at all. The middle men are there for a reason. Chargebacks are there for a reason, bitcoin does not do away with that. If a vendor wants to screw over a buyer in bitcoin there is no quick and easy redress like there is with credit card/paypal. 
If bitcoin matures into something that can actually be used as a proper currency it will have all the same oversight as a traditional currency, and the same middlemen.
@_date: 2014-02-25 12:00:42
At least in the traditional financial markets inside trading is not supposed to occur. In Bitcoin land it is par for the course.

Given all the problems with Gox, how much money was actually being sent to the exchange in the last 6 months?

If you pay a company a deposit and they go bankrupt and you don't get your money back that is not theft unless something illegal was done, it could be mismanagement.

and no test environment. Its a wonder they kept hold of the bitcoins for as long as they did.
@_date: 2014-02-21 15:02:28
Same could be said for any exchange out there.  Best way to make money... Run an exchange well for 3 years then make a runner with all the bitcoins. 
@_date: 2014-03-05 10:10:07
if that is your only copy of the key then when someone steals it from you, it stays stolen, they may not get the bitcoins back but neither will you.

Where did you get the audit info from?
@_date: 2014-02-25 12:42:19
Because everyone worries what can happen to mtgox can happen to other exchanges.
@_date: 2014-03-02 12:57:53
Well in the examble of mtgox it would have been good for there to have been in place regulation that they had to have independat auditing on a daily basis that they had the Bitcoins or that they were held with a custodian.

What stops a hacker from just combining the two keys and transferring money that way? 
@_date: 2014-03-03 14:13:38


If you did this in a bank, then it could be that they know you there already from previous transactions and do not need to verify your identity again? How did you give them the details of your account? If you came with a cheque book and/or card then they would be using this to verify your identity.
@_date: 2014-03-04 18:42:56
How do you know that? Could it not be people who were going to buy anyway and chose bitcoin as a payment method?

Theory:The db on mtgox server was hacked to report an incorrect amount of fiat on peoples account, such that when it was compared to the bank account everything seemed fine. If someone had compromised the server then this would be easy.

I am guessing dixie is facepalming that they were on the server.
These should not have been stored on the server at all, they should be in a separate offline server somewhere, the scans would be needed for regulatory compliance purposes only. 
The level of incompetence being displayed for a business handling so much money is mind blowing.
@_date: 2014-02-25 11:54:32
Losing cold storage would be more likely due to the same reasons that someone gets their fiat stolen from their house, fire or theft.

The fact that they have steadily restricted the ability for users to withdraw fiat is evidence they are insolvent. 
@_date: 2014-03-03 15:05:27
Not really. Once the coins get transferred from one address to another you have no way of knowing who owns them, the coins could even have the same address and ownership changes (unlikely but two trusted parties transfer the private key between them). Perhaps mtgox sold the coins to someone else after the test? Perhaps someone used their bitcoins for the proof that mtgox had the bitcoins and mtgox never even owned them. 
@_date: 2014-02-14 09:07:26

There is nothing for them to do, other than perhaps temporarily barring international transactions, but this then also would stop you from doing any transactions abroad, so it is hardly a good solution.
For someone to take money out of your account they need to walk into a bank with the original document at the very least.
If you had a debit/credit card attached then I would get a new one.
@_date: 2014-02-14 09:23:41
It seems like the general consensus at least on reddit bitcointalk is that 300 is a cheap price for a bitcoin, so there would be many people waiting to pick them up at that price, why do you need an extra group 'friends of mtgox' for that to occur? 
If there are not that many buyers at 300, then the strategy of depressing the price down so much is a foolish one as the price will just stay depressed.
The more obvious answer to me is that mtgox does not have the bitcoins it says it does and/or that they have run out of funds (hence why it is so hard to withdraw money). Then they hide behind these technical issues to obfuscate the problem.
To me if there is manipulation it does not need an external party. mtgox could just depress the market price enough that they can buy the missing bitcoins back at a cheap price and make up the difference. They would not even need any money for this as at the moment mtgox is practically a closed system where money never escapes so they could just make it up. If that is what is occurring in mtgox then the best bet is to hold your bitcoins and hope that enough other people don't hold so that mtgox does not go under completely.
@_date: 2014-02-28 11:10:02
At this point I think the news that gox lost has lost all the coins is priced in, so it is neither.

The same could have beed said for many banks during the banking crisis.  The thought process of most people probably went,  mtgox is the longest running exchange, has been through lots before and survived, and that they still have large volume. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 12:23:42


That just seem ridiculous. Cold storage should always have most of the Bitcoins, so it would be trivial to add up all the balances of Bitcoins on mtgox and see that cold storage no longer has 90% of them, and realise there is a problem.

Well if someone buys it before bankruptcy then they would need to take on the liabilities also, so people would get their money back. 
After bankruptcy then perhaps some but certainly not all.
But if they did lose 750k Bitcoins, no ones coming in to save the day on that one, especially given mtgox reputation is completely trashed, why would you bother? Instead use the money to start up a brand new exchange.
@_date: 2014-02-25 11:59:01
Perhaps that regulation stopped US people putting their money in mtgox and saved them from losing their money.

Its an old paradigm, we used to live in a world where you had to worry about each vendor, that is why visa came about. The current system promotes commerce while going back would hamper it.
