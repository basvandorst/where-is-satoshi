There is no reason to hold any of these altcoins other than blind speculation on an increasing price, for which there is very little reason besides the obvious pumps and dumps.
Here is a classic article that explains [the problem with altcoins]( really well. It's a little bit outdated when it comes to the specific coins it discusses, but the general gist of it is still perfectly true.

I don't think there's a fee, but I might be wrong. More likely it was attempted tax evasion: Smuggling cash into a foreign country is the poor man's (and old lady's) way of trying not to pay taxes on some money. Huuuuuuuuge sums are probably stolen from the government this way, so we have to make sure this never happens again!!

This is actually a real issue, because so far there is no easy way for the common user to achieve an acceptable level of privacy when using bitcoin.
Anyone who knows what they're doing can of course already use mixing services or coin-join services to hide their tracks. There is hope that when Darkwallet gets released it will enable everyone to use bitcoin privatly without having to know anything about the above.

@_date: 2014-06-26 13:38:13
Yes, because of two reasons:
1. With a brain wallet passphrase, EVERYONE can try to brute force your brain wallet. They don't need anything to do it, they can just try as many brain wallets as possible until they find yours. While with a BIP38 passphrase, only someone who actually has your encrypted key can attempt to brute force it, and nobody else. 
2. BIP38 is A LOT harder to brute force than an SHA256 brain wallet. So even if someone somehow gets your encrypted key, it would take them a lot longer to break it.
Edit: By the way, it's BIP38 not 32.

It's kind of... complicated. But when sending to a stealth address, the sender creates a new and previously unknown bitcoin address where she sends her bitcoins to. The receiver can then look for that transaction in the blockchain, but only he knows what he is looking for, and only he can then deduce the private key to that address once he found it. (Of course this is all done automatically by the wallet.)

I think my simple model is more than good enough to explain the correlation between price and hash rate and illustrate that this correlation leads to a situation where the value of a mined bitcoin represents its mining cost, or vice versa. Nowhere did I suggest using it to make any predictions.

I disagree. We entrust our money to a third party because there is no alternative. Except using cash, which is extremely limited in many ways. 
Bitcoin is a digital good. It's basically sending signed messages over a trust-free network. Why should there be no technical solutions to the problem of usability and security? Already now we are seeing huge steps towards ease of use with multisig services and hardware wallets. Bitcoin even is the first money where the owner can make backups of it, as many as they want to. I'm pretty optimistic in that regard.

As I've already explained [here]( transaction fees right now are not really implemented in a way to incentivize miners to process the transactions. That motivation comes from keeping the Bitcoin network valuable. The main purpose behind the current fee structure is pretty much only to prevent the blockchain from getting spammed.
So for now, the fee structure is hard coded into the client, and is regularly adjusted to reflect changes in the bitcoin price. Always with the goal of finding a balance between making transactions as cheap as possible for the normal user, but making them as expensive as possible for a potential spammer. 
In the future when the block reward will be much smaller in relation to the sum of the transaction fees, the transaction fees will replace the block reward as the main incentive for miners to mine blocks. This is when the intended purpose of transactions fees as a free market mechanism can actually come into play: Transaction fees will then slowely become an accurate representation of the actual cost of processing transactions. 
Edit: Sorry I forgot to actually answer your question. The change that can be made is replacing the hard coded fee structure with a free market determined fee structure. The bitcoin devs are in fact already working on that. But as I described above, this mechanism won't really be very effective as long as the block reward is so high (in my opinion).

I think the answer to your first question is really simple: An altchain only makes sense if it provides additional utility over the standard bitcoin chain.

This is a common misconception: There is absolutely no correlation between hash rate and security of the Bitcoin network. What actually matters and what makes the Bitcoin network "secure" is the necessary monetary investment to aquire more than 50% of the hash rate. 
So no, those billions of dollars going into mining are not wasted at all, because it's exactly that money that makes Bitcoin secure. The hash rate is just a number.

* Not really. Price stability is a result of market liquidity. So in a way, if everyone is holding, and only a very small percentage of bitcoins are traded on the open market, then the volatility will be exceptionally high, because the market is so illiquid. That said, holding bitcoins reduces the supply side of the market, thus increasing the equilibrium price of supply and demand. And a higher price means that the market liquidity measured in fiat increases. So it's kind of a double edged sword.
* Lost bitcoins are essentially the same as bitcoins that are being held and are not available on the market. From a market perspective, there is almost no difference between someone long-term holding bitcoins, and someone having lost access to their bitcoins.
* Usually, updates to the bitcoin protocol don't break backwards compatibility. If they do, they create a fork, which means that there are then two different versions of bitcoin that coexist in parallel. This is not a desirable outcome and devs, miners and the rest of the community will want to work together to agree on a single version of the blockchain.

As long as this is the case, and as long as noone you don't trust gains physical access to your laptop, your solution should be as safe as it gets.
Just make sure to verify (by checking the checksums or signatures) all the binaries and source codes you use to generate bitcoin addresses, as a compromised wallet could give you pre-generated addresses to which someone else already has the private keys.

@_date: 2014-06-03 21:42:19
A [backup of your wallet.dat]( contains the private keys to your bitcoin addresses and not the bitcoins themselves. So if you backup your wallet.dat and then restore it, it will always give you access to the most recent bitcoin balance in your addresses.
However, the bitcoin core client is creating a new address every time you make a sending transaction, which then receives the [change amount]( from the transaction. That's why a wallet.dat backup contains a [key pool]( of 100 unused addresses which will be used for newly created change addresses when you make a transaction. This ensures that your backup stays up to date with all your private keys for around 100 transactions. After that, you should make a new backup.

In my opinion, as long as people think that Bitcoin is and will be useful for them, it is already a success.

It's really not as easy as you think it is:
First of all, nobody knows how many people own how many bitcoins. All those articles claiming to do know are making huge assumptions based on balances on addresses on the blockchain. This is at best an indicator of bitcoin distribution.
Second, Bitcoin currently represents a measly 7 billion usd of (theoretical) wealth. There are hundreds of trillions of usd of wealth in the world. That's hundreds of thousands of billions of usd. Do you honestly believe that the distribution of these trillions of dollars will significantly change due to the possible advent of Bitcoin? No it wont! Old money will buy the new money and that's that.
You can't even compare the two.
@_date: 2014-08-27 12:38:39




It's not that simple:
Bitcoin as a technology might be easily replaceable. But just as with gold and silver, Bitcoin is the one application of the blockchain technology that managed to build up enough investor confidence to be valued in the billions of dollars. No other copy of it comes anywhere close to that. 
Plus, just the technology in itself doesn't have much utility at all: If I create a fork of Bitcoin (aka another altcoin), that fork will have close to zero utility to anyone, because it is missing all the network effects from which Bitcoin derives its utility. In fact, only the combination of blockchain technology AND the network effects of its ecosystem make it valuable as a currency or money. And that's exactly what Bitcoin has been doing for the past 5 years: It slowly and organically built up both investor confidence as well as market adoption. This is not something that can be easily emulated by a copy (just look at how many have tried).

All that is needed to "improve" Bitcoin's confirmation time is changing a single value in the code. That's pretty much what all the altcoins did to "improve" confirmation times. It's an absolute no-brainer change.
That said, please understand what confirmations really stand for:
The way confirmations work, faster confirmation times just mean that less hashing power (in relation to the total hashing power of the network) has to be exerted in order to solve a new block. That means that with a faster confirmation rate, every confirmation adds less confidence to a transaction than it would with a slower confirmation rate.
Of course one could argue that even if a 1 minute confirmation time is a lot less meaningful than a 10 minute confirmation time, it's still better to have at least some form of confidence after 1 minute as opposed to still having a completely unconfirmed transaction. That is somewhat true, but the main problem is that shorter confirmation times increase the orphaning rate for new blocks tremendously, which means that even though some nodes see a transaction as confirmed after 1 minute, that block has a relatively high risk of getting orphaned, thus adding an additional factor of uncertainty to every confimation. In the end it's a trade-off, and Satoshi obviously weighted the pros and cons in favour of a 10 minute window.
And that's why only people who don't understand confirmations (and of course stupid r/bitcoin trolls) think that "it's a big problem".

That's just not true! Increasing the length of the blockchain makes every past block inlcuded in it more secure against being orphaned (due to a malicious actor or other circumstances), regardless of how long it took to solve the latest block or how many new transactions were included.

A wallet is a client that manages a list of bitcoin addresses for you. Bitcoin core does that. That means your bitcoin core wallet most likely consists of multiple addresses, and the balance shown by it is the sum of all the addresses under its control.

As far as I understand it the only editing that was done was cutting off the first half of the conversation, which I just watched (or rather listened to) for the past 30 minutes. Lots of technical talk, which is just that, a lot of talking and nothing else.
And leaked or not leaked, it doesn't change the fact that you are not only extremely defensive and unnecessarily confrontational, but also surprisingly uncooperative: You basically told those guys to take their legitimate concerns and go fuck themselves. And you did that knowing full well that it could severely impact and damage your business if your intimidation and threatening legal consequences doesn't shut them up. Why would you take that risk if you had nothing to hide?

I still don't understand how that is a problem. Is Cisco Systems morally responsible for all the child porn traffic that passes through their routers, just because they happen to build the backbone infrastructure of the internet? Should we be outraged about the thousands of gigabytes of child porn that flow through their hardware every day?
Why should I be morally responsible for other people using a certain tool in a certain way just because I also happen to use that tool, even though I have no interest in using it for any illicit purposes at all? Why should I care that some 0's and 1's on my computer can be arranged in such a way that it creates a picture showing child porn, if I am neither involved in the creation or consumption of it in any way? 
Did you know that all child porn ever created is stored in the number Pi? How is that not a problem for mathematicians??

Ok, how about I make my own assumptions then:
For the whole period of the summer 2013, the price was hovering around $100. I think it's only fair to assume that this represents the fundamental value of Bitcoin at the time, right? It was a long period of price stability, and the timeframe is even closer to the present than your reference timeframe of early 2013, which means that markets had more time to find a fair price. Therefore I think my assumption is closer to the truth than yours for these reasons.
Now we need some measurement for the fundamentals. Why not just take the simplest of them all, the [number of transactions]( There we see an increase of transactions from around 25k in summer 2013 to around 75k today. That's a factor of 3.
As I already mentioned, Metcalfe's law postulates that the value of a network is proportional to the square of the number of its users. So in our case, we replace users with transactions and get a correlation factor of 3 * 3 = 9.
This leads us to a fundamental value of Bitcoin that is $100 * 9 = $900 today.
Oh look, that's more or less the same value got with [his price model]( which is completely independent of any of the assumptions I just made. HOW CRAZY IS THAT?!

True, you could argue that even 4 cents is money and it's better than nothing and it's the thought that counts. Unfortunately for people who are already unsure or even critical about Bitcoin, this will look a lot like spam, and might reinforce their opinion that Bitcoin is nothing but a pyramid scheme ponzi scam or whatever.

Probability of finding at least one block over one year = 1 - ((1-(your_hashrate/total_network_hashrate)) \^ (365\*24\*6))
I just wrote that up so I might have made an error. Also, this assumes a constant network hashrate which is obviously not the case.
Edit: So if my formula is correct, and if you actually meant to say 11 GH/s for your gridseed, your chances of finding a block would be about [0.28%]( if the hashrate stays around 200 million GH/s over the year. Good luck!

Edit: Ok, I was trying to be less confrontational so here's a better response.
My post is about confirmation times in general, and why it's not a problem that Bitcoin has a 10 minutes confirmation time as opposed to having a shorter confirmation time. Your point seems to be about not wanting to wait for 10 minutes after paying for your coffee, which would lead to the old discussion about how secure zero-confirmation transactions are and how off-chain transactions via payment processors as well as "greenaddress" multi-sig transactions can fill such a gap.

Unless it's a really big order for a lot of bitcoins, it wouldn't make much of a difference: The exchange will execute your order by matching it with the best available offers up to $3600 per bitcoin.

One often overlooked problem with switching to a new cryptocoin is the distribution problem: How should the tokens of that new cryptocoin be distributed both fairly and quickly?
Because unlike Bitcoin, that new coin doesn't have another 5 years to slowly grow and be mined by anyone who is willing to take the plunge in that then new, unknown and uncertain technology. Instead, everyone would want to get a big as possible share of it right away, because it now is a proven, valuable and well-known form of currency! 
To avoid that pitfall, if the Bitcoin core devs ever decided to switch to a new cryptocoin (for whatever unlikely reasons), they would most likely take a snapshot of the Bitcoin blockchain and distribute the new tokens according to the distribution of bitcoins. Similar to [this approach](
That means that even in a scenario where Bitcoin gets "officially replaced", the investors would not lose their investment.
@_date: 2014-11-26 11:55:36


But isn't the difference here that in Bitcoin's case, people trust in big companies and in the developers because of the convenience they get from doing so, while with PoS checkpoints that trust is a necessity imposed by how the network functions and reaches consensus? In my opinion those are two fundamentally different qualities of trust.
And regarding your two point at the end: Again, those interventions were unexpected exceptions and could even be seen as part of the development process. They are not part of the protocol.

Not sure if I understand your question correctly. Anyway, if you want to spend the remaining bitcoins, you'll have to include a normal transaction fee, which should be around 0.0001 bitcoins.
The dust collection script just removes all the dust inputs so they won't bloat up your transaction when you try to spend the funds in your wallet, which is what causes the fee to get so big.
Alternatively you could use a wallet that offers a coincontrol feature and manually "micro manage" all your non-dust inputs and send them somewhere else. The result would be similar.

Other than that, when using the blockchain.info online wallet you can add notes to your transactions, which are then stored on blockchain.info's webservers, but they are not stored in the actual blockchain. As far as I know they display those notes to anyone who is looking at the transaction via blockchain.info, so it would be public. However, anyone not using blockchain.info will never see that note.

@_date: 2014-06-10 09:22:30
Isn't Darkcoin that one altcoin that forces everyone to use their built-in coinjoin with every transaction, while Bitcoin offers a choice whether to do a normal transaction, a coinjoin transaction, or whatever other kind of transaction there is and possibly will be?

It might be a case of [compressed vs uncompressed address](
Basically, for every private key there are two valid bitcoin addresses: A compressed address and an uncompressed address. In order for the wallet to know which one to use, the [base58 encoding of the private key]( contains a flag byte which tells whether this is supposed to be used with a compressed or an uncompressed address.
So when you have your private key in base58 format, if it starts with a 5 it's for an uncompressed address, and if it begins with a K or an L it's for a compressed address.
If however you have your private key in binary or hex format (the "raw" private key so to say), there is no such flag byte and therefore there's no way to tell if it's supposed to be used with a compressed or uncompressed address. In this case you have to manually tell your wallet which way to import it. 
As far as I know, [Armory always imports keys in the uncompressed format]( and does not yet support compressed keys.

I just don't understand how you come to the conclusion that Bitcoin could be used as an instrument by the government to undermine personal privacy rights. If anything, it makes it harder for governments to invade the personal finances of their citizens, because Bitcoin takes them out of their control.
I agree that Bitcoin could be used as an "excuse" to legitimize invasive actions by the government, much like the threat of terrorism is being used in such a way. But in the end, at least in a democratic country, it is (or at least should be) down to what the people decide is in their own best interest. And I can not see how the people would be willing to give up all their privacy rights just to get rid of banks. Most people don't hate banks enough for that.

I think a 10% premium for the convenience of buying with a credit card is perfectly acceptable. Buying via an exchange also comes with wire transfer fees and trading fees after all.
For example: International SEPA deposits on Bitstamp come with a $15 minimum fee, which would already be more than 10% for amounts smaller than $150. So buying via OP's site would actually be cheaper for small amounts.

There is no need to get so confrontational here. If I'm asking you a question, it's obviously only rhetorical as I am asking everyone who reads this, I just so happen to be discussing this with you. So please don't take it personal, I don't even know you.
And yes, people make their own choices all the time, and that's prefectly fine. I can agree with that. I absolutely can not agree with your assessment that the Ethereum presale is not deceptive however, because in my opinion it is extremely deceptive:
* Unecessary and disproportionate promises everywhere. It's one thing to describe use cases and possible scenarios. It's a completely different thing to promise FUKCING EVERYTHING AND MORE!
* All the risks are only mentioned in the "fine print" in the various pdfs.
*  There is a goddamn clock ticking down on their website, PRESSURING PEOPLE TO BUY NOW! Don't take too much time making an informed decision, you might miss out!
* Why are they selling an essentially unlimited supply? This just increases the uncertainty for the buyer and is completely unnecessaty from an IPO standpoint. It's just another way to get more money without having to make any commitments at all. They don't even have to commit to an initial supply. Buyers are left guessing. Guessing while investing is obviously not good for the investor. Also, don't take too much time guessing, the clock is still ticking you know!
* Lots of hype. Pretty much no product. 
You can disagree with me putting Vitalik and Danny in the same sentence, but please don't use this as an excuse the ignore the facts.

Not every troll response needs to be discussed.


The purpose of colored coins is not to remove trust: When trading any kind of asset there is always trust required between the issuer, the buyer, the seller and a possible middleman. Nothing about this changes with colored coins. The only thing that changes is that now everyone has the possibility to create an easily tradeable digital token representing any kind of asset. So what it does is remove the regulatory and financial hurdles and makes trading assets accessible to everyone.

But personally I am cautiously optimistic, as it's hard to even come up with a convincing scenario in which Bitcoin fails completely. More likely it will at some point in the near future reach a critical point after which it will radically change both the financial world as well as everyone's understanding of what money is and what it should be.

Seriously. The fact that someone could write such an article with a (supposedly) straight face and without realizing the implications of such an argument is just mind boggling to me. It makes me want to donate to the Darkwallet guys right away. But I probably have to be really careful about it, or else I'm going to end up on some terrorist list or something. Crazy.

That's not how it works: Your investment decisions should be based on different ROI scenarios, and then you pick the one or the few investments that perform the best over these different scenarios. But of course you can just say "OMG I NEED TO DIVERSIFY!!11" and put your money in every altcoin on the planet. Good luck with that.

Yes, it appears they want to make money from the service they provide. It's almost as if they saw a business opportunity and took it, and so far they did all the right things with it.

It doesn't have to be exciting for the average Joe. Money is just a means to an end, a tool, a necessity. It's not video streaming, it's not Netflix, it's not endless information ready at the fingertip. But guess what, everyone wants it and everyone uses it. As long as Bitcoin offers advantages over its alternatives it will be used. Most likely, at some point the average Joe won't even know what Bitcoin is and that he's using it. And why should he? It will just be money to him.

This is the reason why I think that even though it sounds like a good idea in theory, it's a really bad idea in practice. I don't care that I have to type a complicated looking bitcoin address because I know that it won't work when I mistype it, so I don't have to worry at all.

@_date: 2014-12-05 13:54:02
The point is, with Bitcoin we don't need all the complex societal constructs that try to ensure and enforce ownership of property to the rightful owner. Now ownership can be defined simply by having control over a private key, and that control can be absolute.
Of course right now this idea is weakened by the fact that securing digital information is far from an easy task, but with the advent of hardware wallets and other solutions, this will likely only be an intermediary issue.

There are no mandatory fees and transactions are pretty much instant, just confirmation takes some time. I know some people believe there will be wide-spread double spending if merchatns accept zero confirmation transactions, but that's just not very realistic. Also, with payment processers like Bitpay and multi-sig greenaddress wallets, zero confirmation will be no problem at all.
@_date: 2014-05-22 10:30:16
Yes, FIAT is broken in a lot of ways and the current interest rates on savings accounts are an absolute joke. But Bitcoin is NOT a savings account! At this point it's a high risk, highly volatile investment. You really can't compare the two. Maybe in a few years when Bitcoin has stabilized and the demand is just slightly above the increasing supply rate, then Bitcoin will be a real alternative to a savings account, but not now.

Transaction times have nothing to do with "efficiency": They are hardcoded into the protocol by setting the mining difficulty in a way that the average confirmation time with the hashrate at that time will be 10 minutes. If the hashrate increases a lot, the confirmation times will temporarily go down, until the next adjustment of the difficulty.

Ownership is kind of a fuzzy concept in itself: Take your car for example. Somehow you are the only person who can make use of that car, because you own it, right? Even though pretty much anyone could take it from you and drive away with it. But that usually doesn't happen, because there is a complex legal system and a complex law enforcement system and a complex criminal punishment system in place to enforce this thing called "ownership" you apparently have of that one car. 
But now imagine these complex but also fragile systems that make sure that noone takes your car away from you break down somewhere or simply change somehow. Now suddenly your ownership of said car doesn't mean that much anymore. Because now it's just a thing anyone can use. Probably the guy with the gun will end up driving it. So did you really own that car in the first place?
Now with Bitcoin however, even if all legal systems break down, you're still in full control of them. You could memorise the private key and nobody could take it from you ever. Your ownership of these bitcoins is not dependant on any fragile systems that could turn against you at pretty much any time. And I would say I like this kind of ownership a lot better.
@_date: 2014-12-05 17:05:57
You make some very good points, as usual. Now I feel bad for posting that potato remark, even though it was in no way meant to support either side's position. It was simply an observation.
To be honest, even though I read most of the stuff that reaches the frontpage on here (and also most of the stuff that doesn't), I didn't follow this story or the discussion surrounding it at all, and I really don't care if it's fake or not. No harm done either way, and at least it appears to have sparked a lively debate, which is always a good thing. So I'm not entirely sure why you picked my comment to reply to, as it isn't even the top comment. But I agree with you when you say that we as a community should try to stand closer together and not let pure skepticism and mistrust get the better of us.
But then again, that really is easier said than done with all the persistent and at times extremely aggressive derailing of almost all submissions by a small number of people with a "contrarian opinion of Bitcoin" around here: They effectively manage to undermine otherwise constructive discussions with their constant concern trolling, their determined focus on spreading negativity for the sake of spreading negativity, and their blatant brigading of controversial threads. This creates an increasingly hostile and toxic environment in this subreddit, and it has only gotten worse lately. In a way, you and the rest of the mods are indirectly responsible for what we are seeing here by not taking the appropriate actions.

If you want to minimize the risk of messing things up, I would suggest to install Electrum, create a new wallet, send your bitcoins to that wallet, then back up the [Electrum seed]( for that wallet (which is really just a list of words that you could even write down on a piece of paper).

Are you serious? The whole premise of using control of a private key as proof of ownership is that this control can be absolute in the sense that the owner never has to entrust anyone else with it.

I think that's actually a good decision: As soon as too many people from this sub start invading that thread it can become a bit off-putting for most non-bitcoiners.

No it didn't propagate to all the nodes. At the time I checked it, my own node hadn't seen the transaction and neither had blockr.io. It got re-broadcast by blockchain.info at some point later, then it got confirmed.

Maybe. But it's still open source, and the code has at least partly been audited, and nothing suspicious has been found so far.
The more reasonable conclusion is that the creators of Truecrypt were pressured by the NSA to include backdoors. They did not want to comply with this, so they instead chose to abandon the project.
Either way, there's just no good alternative on windows. At least not one I am aware of.

When some people, rather than just dismissing something and then going back to doing other things, they instead start becoming very emotionally involved in the topic and spend lots of time and effort trying to convince people of their opinion, for no other reason than to "save" everyone from that evil thing, then it's usually a good indicator that this might actually be worth a second look.

Nobody is forcing you to sign up with Circle or use a similar service. You are free to keep your bitcoins in your own wallet on your own PC and use them as anonymously as you like.

Well sure, if you plan to put your backups away and not touch them for 20 years, then a physical medium is a better choice. But other than that, digital backups are just so much more versatile.

If you also read carefully, you might notice that I not only question your assumption of "hash rate continues its exponential growth", but I also explain to you that there is no reason to believe that we are not at an economic euqilibrium between marginal production cost and value of unit now. This means that already every mined bitcoin almost only covers its production cost. And I also explain to you that this is the situation the market will always fall back to. Thus nothing will change regarding that. Your conclusion of "more coins need be sold as the hash rate increases" is faulty.

Not really. Because even if your paper wallet gets instantly swiped and sent to a new address, the private key for that new address has been generated on the system you're using the import the paper wallet. So if that system is compromised, they can still get stolen.
That's why you need a single system that you can trust with handling your bitcoins. An android wallet is a very manageable solution for that.

What? Do you really know that little about a topic you spend so much time arguing against?
Making the "atomic" unit of a satoshi divisible is equal to changing one line of code. And as doing so does in no way change the past, present or future allocation of bitcoins, not a single miner would have a reason not to adopt this change if it ever got proposed.

Looking at the chain of transactions leading up to this one it seems that there is some automated process at work here which is splitting up and re-consolidation certain amounts in short succession among different addresses, which makes your "oooops I made a mistake when trying to send a transaction" story highly questionable.

You're kidding now, but a while ago something like that happened to me: I bought a small amount of bitcoins for a friend, and sent it to him directly from my bitstamp account. The next time we met it was really awkward because he apparently checked the sending address and now thought I owned something to the tune of 11k bitcoins. He also was kind of shy about mentioning it because he thought he invaded my privacy by checking my balance :)

bitaddress.org just takes a single sha256 hash of your passphrase to create the private key. You don't need any kind of wallet or website to do this, you could just use a command line tool if you want. So yes, you will always be able to create your private key from the passphrase.

Sure, but they have lots of hype and clever marketing to trick people into buying their promises to make up for their lack of a product:
* Unecessary and disproportionate promises everywhere. It's one thing to describe use cases and possible scenarios. It's a completely different thing to promise FUKCING EVERYTHING AND MORE!
* All the risks are only mentioned in the "fine print" in the various pdfs.
* There is a goddamn clock ticking down on their website, PRESSURING PEOPLE TO BUY NOW! Don't take too much time making an informed decision, you might miss out!
* Why are they selling an essentially unlimited supply? This just increases the uncertainty for the buyer and is completely unnecessaty from an IPO standpoint. It's just another way to get more money without having to make any commitments at all. They don't even have to commit to an initial supply. Buyers are left guessing. Guessing while investing is obviously not good for the investor. Also, don't take too much time guessing, the clock is still ticking you know!

The problem really isn't the number. The problem is that people think they can somehow attribute a value to something as abstract as "the fundamentals of bitcoin". Thats just a ridiculous and outright preposterous proposition in itself. Let's look at your reasoning: 
You say in early 2013 the price was at around $10, and you somehow take this as the "real value of the fundamentals" at that time. Why? It's entirely arbitrary.
Then you argue that you think the fundamentals of Bitcoin have increased (what does that even mean) by maybe a factor of 10 since then. Why? Why not 5? Why not 100? Again completely arbitrary.
Then you assume a linear correlation between the "measurement of the fundamentals" (again, whatever that might be) and the price. Why? Why does it have to be a linear correlation? If anything, assuming the network effects are an important part of those fundamentals, then it should be an [exponential correlation](
So in summary, you took a bunch of completely arbitrary assumptions that you pulled out of thin air and then went ahead to say "the fundaments are probably only worth $100 now". Well okay then.

During the April 2013 bubble some of my friends who used to scoff at the whole bitcoin thing suddenly started talking about it and asking me questions. Some of them even bought some. Then after the crash during the long period when it was around $100, they got really really quiet again. Nobody was talking about bitcoin anymore. Then suddenly, boom!
Exactly the same thing is happening again right now: Lots of people were coming to me for advice on how to get/store bitcoins during the November/December bubble, and it was kind of the hot topic for a while. And now... silence again. It's eerie how similar it feels :)

No, all you can do is tell bitcoin core which inputs to spend when you're doing a transaction, instead of letting it select the inputs automatically. So you could use this to send all your coins to a new wallet while leaving your friend's coins in there if you don't want to use pywallet.
@_date: 2014-06-02 18:40:37
Well we can disagree on this all day and we won't be any wiser in the end. You are basing your conclusion on assumptions, I base my conclusion on well-known market mechanisms. Maybe the truth lies somewhere in the middle. 
Either way, there is one very obvious effect the price has on the amount of bitcoins being sold from mining:
When the price rises, miners will need to sell less bitcoins to offset their costs until the hash-rate catches up. When the price falls, it's the opposite. And since during the past 5 months the price has been falling, I would expect that the amount of bitcoins that has been sold from mining was relatively high. And now that the market trend has reversed, there will (at least temporarily) less mined bitcoins getting sold, therefore even reinforcing the uptrend. How does that fit you picture? :)

Complete hyperbole. The protocol specificiations are **known**, as it is what makes the Bitcoin network the Bitcoin network. There is no trust involved here. I can read the specifications and understand them and understand their implications, and I can **know** if that's what it is supposed to be or not. We only trust the devs and others because of convenience and because reverse-engineering the protocol every time would be excessive. But at least that is an option.
With PoS checkpoints, that aspect of trust gets backed into the network protocol. That is indeed a huge difference.


Yes, Gavin Andresen can encourage users to do something. But they still have a choice. Nobody needs to trust Gavin.
EDIT: Maybe a better way to word it would be that there is a clear objectivity to the bitcoin protocol, while Vitalik is obviously suggesting to introduce subjectivity into the PoS protocol, hence the title of his blog posting.

@_date: 2014-11-29 12:42:46
Well no, that's not really true either. The market always tries to find an equilibrium price, at which supply matches demand. Once that equilibrium is reached, and nothing changes, then the price will be stable. For that it doesn't directly matter whether people are mostly holding or spending.
But when people change their behaviour, by either holding a lot more or spending a lot more, then that equilibrium gets out of balance, and volatility increases. But this is only temporary, as the market will simply try to find a new balance, at which it would be stable again.
Now the problem is that if the liquidity of the market is low, then it takes only a small change in behaviour to cause a high amount of volatility. Whereas when the market liquidity is high, volatility only increases if there are significant changes in supply or demand.

1) Replace 'Bitcoin supporters' with 'Linux supporters', 'Apple users', 'Manchester United fans', etc. Are you seriously trying to postulate that this is something that is unique to Bitcoin supporters?
2) No need to make generalisations like that! There are people who support Bitcoin solely for idealistic reasons, there are people who push Bitcoin purely for their own financial gains, and there are people who believe in Bitcoin and are additionally incentivised by the potential of an increasing value of their holdings. 
3) Bitcoin can't and won't solve the problem of inequality of wealth distribution in the world. Just because that's something it can't solve shouldn't be held against it now, should it?

What if Hitler called ripple a scam? Well, it doesn't matter, it's still a scam. Just because some people behind those sites may have ulterior motives doesn't change the facts.
The distribution "mechanism" for XRP is inherently flawed: It's in the hand of a centralized company, driven purely by financial interest. They create an artificial scarcity by withholding large amounts of XRP. The market cap reported for ripple is thus entirely meaningless and nothing but the result of the manipulation carried out by Ripplelabs. They are misleading potential buyers/adopters for the sake of profit. They are scamming people.

CNBC: you mentioned it doesn't cost much to invest in it. how much does it cost? we have yet to see a good figure on what you paid.
Draper: oh, all i know is i paid more than all the other guys did, and so, winning at an auction is a mixed bag. but i made a decision that this was going to be a long-term bet on bitcoin and all the good things it can do for all of the countries of the world but particularly it's very valuable in the rising economies that have high inflation. bitcoin's a great alternative for some of these economies where inflation really zaps the strength of a country's economy. so, i expect like bitpagos in argentina and pagotech in africa and in mexico coincove. all these companies will really thrive because their people are not as confident in their own government fiat currency. and i think overall bitcoin's going to grow and as it grows, the value of a bitcoin continues to rise. 
CNBC: would you have made this purchase when bitcoin was trading at the highs? how long -- i know this is a silly question in some respects, but how long until it revisits that? 
Draper: oh, i don't -- you know, this is a long-term bet. i don't know -- it oscillates. bitcoin oscillates up and down and people buy high and sell low and in general i think this is a trend very much upward because there's a limited amount of bitcoin and more and more use. it's very easy. go grab a coin base account or set up a -- if you're an institution or a large investor, set up an account at bit me and you can go out and you can buy bitcoin and i think people should experiment with it. i mean, i think people should try it. it's very easy to move around. you can buy and sell things with snap card. there are a lot of great things you can do with bitcoin and i think that's quite exciting.
CNBC: on your point on how to get it. a lot of hedge funds watch the show, mutual funds. to do big transactions like you did or the brothers did. what's the best way to buy it and get the best price? you participated in an auction. are there negotiated transactions? buying $10 million of bitcoin and a multi-billion dollar hedge fund, how do you do that? 
Draper: so i think you have to generally buy it on the open market but you can have trade earls go look at -- go to bitme which is the varum platform and you can put in bids, put in orders to buy bitcoin and over some period of time somebody's going to hit your bid. so it's not a hard thing to do for a big institution. it might take a couple of days to fulfill the order but yeah. there's bitcoin out there. i think it's -- i'm clearly a believer. and i also believe that it's going to be really good for people who have less faith in their own country's currency. right. and i also think as a fiduciary, i think investors should have some bitcoin in their portfolios.

Here's the short answers:
* Blockchain.info does not pool their user's bitcoins, as they don't have access to them in the first place.
* That means if you have not initiated that transaction, then someone else has. 
* That means either someone had access to your computer while you were logged in, someone has stolen your login and password (I suppose you didn't set up 2FA), or someone got hold of your wallet backup and your password (maybe via your email account where blockchain.info usually sends backups to).
* Blockchain.info is a web wallet with a stupid name: The bitcoin blockchain is a decentralized ledger, blockchain.info is a centralized company offering services around bitcoin, such as a wallet.
* That means they have no power to reverse anything. Once a transaction has been broadcast to the bitcoin network, it's out of their hands.


The phiser, hacker or whatever does not need to have an account with blockchain.info. What you are looking at is blockchain.info's webinterface that shows you the content's of the bitcoin blockchain. All bitcoin addresses, balances and transactions are visible there, regardless of what service or wallet has been used.
Unfortunately I think there is not much you can do, other than trying to figure out what exactly happened to prevent further losses in the future.

Why does this nonsense get repeated all the time? It's just completely wrong and shows a fundamental lack of understanding of how the Bitcoin network works: The block reward has nothing to do with processing transactions, instead it's a means to enable the Bitcoin network to bootstrap itself.
Unfortunately it's an all too common misconception that the function of the block reward is to offset the cost of processing transactions. That is not the case. Instead the block reward algorithm is designed to allow for a gradual and as-fair-as-possible distribution of bitcoins, and most importantly it gives an incentive to miners to put their processing power towards ensuring the integrity of the network, regardless of transaction fee volume. It is quite an ingenious system and so far it has worked out beautifully!

The number of transactions that fit in a block are not dependent on hashing power, but limited by an arbitrarily set block size limit of 1 mb per block. This is necessary primarily because of limitations in network bandwith and network latency when transmitting blocks to other nodes, because bigger blocks take longer to propagate and therefore have a higher risk of getting orphaned (which means they won't be included in the longest blockchain and the miners don't get a reward).
There are many ideas on how to work around this in the future, [like this one]( Also see

Sure, if an investor comes to that conclusion, he might want to take a more diversified investment approach. The problem here is that no smart investor will come to that conclusion.

That's not really true. If someone finds poetry.txt and takes a closer look at it, they will notice that it's actually a bitcoin wallet.
If someone finds a jpeg image and takes a closer look at it, all they see is a picture. They would have to somehow know or guess that this picture was used to create a private key and then convert it.

The long term positive effects of an increased network effect far outweigh the short term price effect of hoarding in my opinion. I like Daniel Krawisz's articles a lot, but that one is a bit silly:
By paying or tipping someone in bitcoin, you're not saying "here take this I don't want it". That's a really stupid conclusion to make. Instead you are saying "I am using bitcoin as a means to transfer wealth from me to you, because it's one of the best and easiest ways to do exactly that". 
Money is useless in itself. It is only useful as a representation of value that can be used to transfer wealth from one person to another. Without that, it's completely worthless.

Miners can't confirm transactions instantly. They have to solve a block, which on average takes the whole network about 10 minutes. A miner can only decide whether they want to include a transaction in the next block should they be the one who solves it. And one of the incentives to do so is the miner's fee of the transaction.

Not at all. The price is determined solely by supply (sellers) and demand (buyers): If demand for bitcoins up to $10,000 outweighs the supply of bitcoins for less than that, then the price of a bitcoin will be &gt;$10,000. The amount of money that gets "put in" is only really relevant as a measure of the the liquidity of the market.

It is a risky investment for now, because well, it's very much a niche technology with a lot of potential. But once that potential is realised and it becomes the standard for transacting value, there won't be a lot of risk involved anymore.
Of course 900 years is a pretty bad example because it's just such an incredibly long time, and nobody has the slightest idea what the world will look like that long into the future. Of course 5000 years ago, a timespan of 900 years was a lot more tangible, because the world wasn't changing as rapidly as it is now.

That's not really the same: Most pro-bitcoiners have a vested interest in furthering the adoption of Bitcoin. This could be either a financial interest by holding bitcoins or being involved in a bitcoin business, or a purely ideological interest, or a combination of both. 
Anti-bitcoiners on the other hand don't really have anything to gain (except maybe the odd occurence of a speculator shorting bitcoins and trying to influence the price negatively). They are doing this purely because, at some point in the past 5 years, they convinced themselves that Bitcoin can not work. And they decided that they now need to save others from falling into this scary trap. But why are they being so emotional and personally involved in doing that? Out of the good of their heart? Maybe. Or more likely, because they had and have serious doubts about their conclusion and are therefore trying to convince themselves by convincing others, attempting to silence that little voice in the back of their heads that is telling them that maybe, just maybe, they might be wrong.
And now that Bitcoin is worth several hundreds of dollars, they also have to face the fact that their decision came with a pretty big opportuninty cost so far. One could even say they now have some sort of emotional sunk-costs invested into being anti-bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-10-28 16:11:40
Yes, and the part of Justcoin that is actually part of the BTC ecosystem is giving their users their bitcoins back. But the part of Justcoin that is part of the altcoin trading "ecosystem" just screwed you over. Altcoin trading can be very profitable if you happen to time one of the many pump and dumps correctly, but it also comes with many risks, including additional counterparty risk.

I absolutely agree with you on that. But the problem with security doesn't lie directly with Bitcoin, but with the devices and online services used to store them. 
For example: The guy losing 750 btc in the article you linked had them stolen because he kept them stored on his online laptop. A laptop that he even took with him to travel and connect to unsecured wireless networks. I mean come on! Who the hell would travel with that much money stored in their suitcase?? Noone! It's careless and stupid. 
But you are right, most people are just as careless and stupid as that guy, and blaming them won't help anyone in the long run. That's why the only feasible solution are hardware wallets that are extremely easy to use and affordable. The Trezor is almost there already.

@_date: 2014-09-03 08:56:58
True. But these are the exceptions. My point was that fiat stability is not a product of intervention by central banks, but instead a reflection of the stability (or instability) of its underlying macro economic aspects. So OP's argument that a currency needs an intervening central authority to reduce volatility is just wrong.

@_date: 2014-04-30 21:00:59
Why not both? 
But seriously, it's not a problem. Some people argue that an inherently deflationary currency might be undesirable from a macroeconomic perspective. But as always with economics, such a statement entirely depends on the underlying models and assumptions: Some models say a deflationary currency is bad, others say it's not bad at all. If we're lucky we'll find out who's right soon enough.
@_date: 2014-05-20 18:29:01

@_date: 2014-07-28 10:17:15
So you want to increase the volatility of your already highly volatile investment? 
I would seriously advise against putting your bitcoins in any of the current "investment opportunities": Most of them are shady as fuck if not outright scammy, they are all operating in legal gray zones and there is pretty much nothing protecting your investment if anything goes wrong or if they simply decide to take everyone's money and run.

No the transaction was not properly broadcast, which was the reason why it didn't get confirmed for so long. Blockchain.info re-broadcast it by itself (I assume they do that, similar to bitcoin-qt, with transactions that are still unconfirmed after a while).
But you are correct that the  would not have worked, because obviously blockchain.info would think it already exists. So if he was in a hurry he could have rebroadcast it using a node that is not blockchain.info.

No product.
Extensive marketing campaign.
Trying to generate as much hype as possible.
Promising everything and even more.
Building a mysterious image around their supposed child prodigy inventor.
IPO that is designed to get them as much money as possible by leaving the investors in the dark about pretty much everything, but appealing to their fear of missing out and even pressuring them into buying by having a clock ticking down, and the longer they wait the less they get for their money. Even though it's just less of nothing but a promise.
Putting up a contract that pretty much exempts them from ever having to deliver anything of value. All they have to deliver is a redeemable coupon (aka wallet file) that is good for 2000 of however many tokens there one day might be. Whether these are useful or not doesn't matter.

You need to check your harddrive for the wallet.dat file which contains all the private keys to your bitcoin addresses. You can find the file in the [bitcoin data directory](
If for some reason you can not access the filesystem anymore, you might find this thread helpful:
Once you have recovered the wallet.dat file, just re-install bitcoin qt and copy the wallet.dat back into the data directory.

I'm in the same boat as As awesome as it is that they are finally accepting bitcoin donations, this kind of "yes we take your money but don't expect us to put it up on our pretty donation page" behaviour leaves a bitter aftertaste for me. There is simply no reason for this, at all.

The mining reward actually has more than one purpose: 
Its most obvious one is incentivizing miners to do proof of work, therefore securing the network by increasing the investement needed to attack it. So the mining reward is not really "buying decentralization" as stated in the video, but it is buying a cost barrier for a nefarious party to attack the network.
The less obvious purpose of the mining reward is to act as a fair and transparent distribution function for the 21 million bitcoins that will be created. Look at Ripple or Stellar for example: These lack such a fair and transparent distribution function, and therefore rely on a central entity to give away or sell the premined coins. And the drawbacks of such an approach are more than obvious.

There is no reason not to put up your bitcoin address for donations as it will cost you nothing. But I will be honest here: I wouldn't expect much from it!
[Desrow]( for example, a fairly popular SC2 streamer, had a bitcoin address up for quite a while now and so far there hasn't been a single donation. It appears that bitcoin has not yet reached the twitch.tv crowd :(
(Unless Desrow regularly changes his address as to not show how many donations he has gotten. I haven't verified that.)
@_date: 2014-07-25 13:10:27
I think it is. Some people here expect adoption to steadily grow over time, and are quick to point out that despite all the new merchants supporting Bitcoin, consumer adoption seems to have been low. But that's really to be expected:
There needs to be a critical mass of buying and spending opportunities before Joe Shmoe is going to use bitcoins, because before that critical point is reached, conventional money (paper bills, debit and credit cards) just has too much more utility for the normal consumer, because well, it can be used EVERYWHERE. 
Of course that critical point is different for everyone. Some are more willing to go out of their way to embrace a new technology while others need a lot of convincing. So before a majority of merchants accept Bitcoin, the average user will be reluctant to use it. But once that point is reached, there are going to be some crazy times....

It's not as if my few dollars would make a difference in the grand scheme of anything really. What makes a difference is people and organisations realizing the potential that bitcoin offers in this regard, and then using it. 
Stop forcing me to give out my personal information just because I want to support you with some money, because it's not necessary anymore. Stop making me give you my complete credit card information just because I want to send you $5, because that's completely unreasonable.

On second thought, the gap limit probably doesn't matter even when starting with a fresh wallet from seed every time, as the addresses are not unused and electrum will therefore recognize it either way. So you can probably just ignore that advice.

@_date: 2014-06-04 11:43:32
Yes, from the perspective of the bitcoin network it does not make a difference if those are all your addresses or not, the fee requirements are still the same.
If you're using a decent wallet it should calculate the necessary fees for you (I don't know how good the blockchain.info wallet is at doing this).

Yeah but the funny thing is that with bitcoins, this pretty much does not apply: Nobody can see the bitcoins on you, even if you're being searched/mugged. Nobody can take the bitcoins from you, even if they know you have them (assuming your wallet uses some sort of access restrictions).

@_date: 2014-11-20 20:23:59
I don't see how the paradox of choice would apply to a list of payment options on a donation page. Pretty much everyone planning to make a donation already decided what payment method to use before even going to the page. The list of options is then just necessary to confirm to the person that his method of choice is available. Just because Jimbo Wales says something doesn't mean it's true.
And I don't feel bitter, I said it leaves a bitter aftertaste. English is not my first language, but even I understand the difference between the two. Just because I can now give them my money in an easy and private way doesn't mean I can't also voice my opinion about how I think that this is an unfortunate decision to keep it seperate.

And if you can agree with that, wouldn't it make sense to bet on its success, becasue there is just so much more to win than to lose?

Because Bitcoin is essentially just an abstract representation of value, and is therefore good for nothing else but trading it for tangible goods and services of similar value. Just like any kind of money really. I'm a big fan of Daniel Krawisz and his articles, but this line of thinking is just stupid.

That's impossible to tell. But for me the point to take away from this is that there is just so much money out there, an inconceivable amount of money really, that talking about a measly 7 billion usd market cap for a global payment system and global currency that is independent of any central authorities, that has a clearly limited supply and comes with properties that give it an advantage in almost all regards over any other kind of payment system or currency or asset, just seems like such a total joke. Regardless of whether you think Bitcoin is overvalued or undervalued, in the end its value right now is insignificant compared to the sheer amount of money in the world. It's hardly a drop in the ocean. And nevertheless it's starting to make some pretty big ripples already...

Dogecoin is stupid. Nascar is stupid. None of this would make the world a better place. This is not what I think Bitcoin should be about.
@_date: 2014-06-17 15:45:47
No, it needs 2^160 attempts. Which is still an insanely huge number. And I think a lot of people know about that.
What most people don't realise though is that for every bitcoin address, there are on average 2^96 valid private keys. Which is kind of mind boggling in itself.
@_date: 2014-11-06 17:41:33
No, that's not how it works: The sender will always know the receiver's address. But with a stealth address, nobody else will know about the transaction, even when the stealth address is made public.

The thing is, nobody cares whether you sell your bitcoins or not. So you mentioning that fact is pretty much irrelevant and entirely futile. But if someone as involved as Peter Todd decideds to make a public posting where he claims that he is now soooooo very scared of the Ghash situation that he just sold his bitcoins, then it will definitely have some kind of impact on the community and possibly even on the price. And Peter Todd knew that, and he decided to use this fact to leverage his argumentative position. In my opinion this is not just completely unprofessional behaviour, it's also largely irresponsible, and even a little bit childish.

The head (as in the brain) is probably the biggest problem: What if you wake up and you have no idea of who you are and have no memories of your past? Then what is the point of being brought back? You're basically a different person.
That's probably not too far-fetched of a scenario, as I doubt the brain is able to retain memory like that after being frozen. Even more likely is that there's extensive brain damage and you not only have no memories of yourself, but you're also mentally handicapped. 
Then again it might all work out just fine, who knows.

Yes, it might help in a situation like that. But printing more money isn't "free", it comes with the cost of inflation which reduces the purchasing power of everyone's savings. So in a way, printing more money means taking value from savings and redistributing it to the rest of the economy. This might seem like the lesser evil given certain circumstances, but it's a very unfair solution, because some profit at the expense of others.
And it's not just a very unfair solution, it's also a very short-sighted one: Greece's economy wasn't in trouble because the stars aligned in a certain unfavorable way, the economy was in trouble because of deep structural issues, an overblown "state apparatus", widespread abuse of social benefits and rampant corruption through all sectors. These are the problems that need to be solved, and printing more money won't help with that.

Easiest thing to do if you're not in a hurry is to just leave it alone and wait. One of these things is going to happen after a while:
1. Both transactions confirm and your coins end up in your new core wallet.
2. Only the first transaction confirms and your coins end up in your blockchain wallet.
3. Neither of the transactions confirm and the coins end up back in your old core wallet.
The problem is that you did not include a miners fee in your first transaction.

What you are missing is that the block reward doesn't really serve to offset the cost to process transactions. Instead the block reward algorithm is designed to allow for a gradual and as-fair-as-possible distribution of bitcoins, and most importantly it gives an incentive to miners to put their processing power towards ensuring the integrity of the network, regardless of transaction fee volume. It is quite an ingenious system to enable the Bitcoin network to bootstrap itself.

Illegal under which jurisdiction? Something that's illegal under one law might be perfectly legal under a different law, and vice versa. That's the thing about decentralization, there's no central authority.
In the end it will have to come down to due diligince done by every single user, as they have to assess the legality of a trade under their specific jurisdiction. For some people buying or selling a certain thing might be perfectly legal, while for others it would be a federal offense. Such is the nature of a decentralized market place.

I tried to explain to you why I think that they are not just different, but in fact have a fundamentally different quality to them. I will try again:


Indeed. And once that consensus is established, the component of societal trust gets replaced by the consensus mechanism inherent to the protocol, thus eliminating the requirement of trust.


Again, you are confusing two different things here: Trust in reaching a consensus over the protocol, and trust in reaching a consensus within the protocol. Just because the former is necessary, doesn't mean that the latter should be too.

No, my point is that an unrooted stock android phone is a very secure (comparatively) device to store your bitcoins on. The risk that someone somehow knows that you have a lot of bitcoins on it, and then has both the intention and the skill to somehow exploit a potential security vulnerability in the supplier modification of your android version is NEGLIGIBLE! Especially compared to the risk of losing your bitcoins because you rooted your phone and some app simply got root on it, either with or without your consent.

Well actually, the central banks don't really intervene to reduce the short term volatility, which is what OP is talking about. The central banks only intervene to keep their inflation targets which are usually set on a yearly basis. Fiat currencies are mostly stable in the short term because their underlying economies are large enough and stable enough. Once that macro economic stability is gone, then the fiat currencies suddenly lose their stability as well (see all the hyper-inflation events or the deflationary situation in Japan for example). 
Since Bitcoin is not bound to a single nation's economy and its ups and downs, it could potentially become one of the most stable currencies. But we are an incredibly long way away from that, if it ever happens.

Imagine a world where everyone is leaving permanent footprints all the time anywhere they are going, but those footprints all look exactly the same (because everyone is wearing the same shoes). That means you can not tell a person apart from another by just looking at the footprints, but once you know whos footprints they are, you can easily follow them around and they could never hide from you again.
But what if suddenly there's a whole lot of footprints from a bunch of people converging on a single spot, before diverging into separate paths again? You now have essentially lost track of the person you're following. Of course you could still try to figure out which footprints are the most likely to correspond to the person you're trying to follow by comparing the depths of the imprints which can tell you something about the person's weight. Either way, it now has become a lot harder for you to figure out which path to follow.
In such a world, CoinJoin and similar services provide the means for people to organize meetings where they obfuscate their tracks by all walking around in the same spot. Some services even try to put people of similar weight (similar input sizes) together to leave as little identifiable information as possible.

There's a lot of info in that thread that answers your question. Bottom line is:
- Tor exit nodes can strip the ssl and force an unencrypted http connection with the user. This of course only works if the user doesn't notice that he is not using a secure connection.
- Tor exit nodes can supply fake ssl certificates for the connection. Again, this only works if the user/browser doesn't properly verify the certificate.

[Here]( is another interesting quote:


@_date: 2014-06-02 13:16:25


Instead of making random assumptions, you could instead try to understand the market mechanism driving the hash rate:
The marginal cost of every new bitcoin mined will (on average) always be equal to its market value. If the price rises, the value of a new bitcoin will temporarily exceed its marginal cost of production, which presents a profitable business opportunity for new miners, and the hash rate and therefore the difficulty will increase.
This market mechanism will keep increasing the marginal cost of production until it again meets the market value. Once an equilibrium is reached again, the hash rate will only rise further if it can do so without increasing the marginal cost of production (i.e. more efficient technology or a cheaper source of electricity), otherwise it will remain constant in relation to the price level.

Sure, if you knew that you would never find a block, then you could just as well not mine. But you don't know that.

I have rooted 5 phones so far. And 2 tablets.
And yes, that's how SU permission managers work on Android. But users are stupid, and they are often very quick to give a random app root because "it needs root to work". Some users might even be as careless as to have the SU manager set to allow root access by default. Plus SU managers can be exploited as well.
If I wanted to steal bitcoins from careless android users, I would simply write an app that promises some awesome functionality, but it needs root to do so. If the user gives it root permission, awesome! I can now steal his bitcoins. If he doesn't, whatever, better luck with the next idiot.
Such an "attack" requires absolutely no hacking on my part, only exploiting the carelessnes of the common user, and it is very likely to score me at least some bitcoins.
The sort of attack you describe requires highly sophisticated knowledge of the target system and is not at all easy to pull off. And even if you're using a zero day exploit to do it, those are usually not cheap either. And after all that it only works on a tiny subset of phones out there. Very very unlikely to happen to anyone.
So to sum it up again: Storing bitcoins on a rooted phone is bad idea in my opinion.

A bitcoin transaction can have any number of inputs and any number of outputs, as long as the sum of the outputs doesn't exceed the sum of the inputs.

No, you probably don't. But it is a direct counter-point to the argument that the divesting guy was making about how most people don't care about Bitcoin because it is too involving for them. Well, most of those people already use Paypal...

It's a lot simpler than that: The upcoming auction adds a lot of uncertainty to the market. This triggers some people (aka weak hands) to take the safe bet and sell for now. Potential buyers are also reluctant to jump in before seeing clear signs of a positive trend forming either in anticipation of the auction or as a result of it.

I just realised that there is no easily available overview or explanation out there regarding message signing with bitcoin, how it works and what the possible applications are. All there seems to be are some threads on bitcointalk, reddit and stackexchange. Kind of crazy.

I feel like this is directed towards my input. Maybe you are right. All I can say is that I am extremely reluctant to use my credit card on a website, unless I have a strong feeling that I can trust them. And small bullshit like the background color can have a huge impact on the first impression someone has when visiting a website, and we know first impressions are hard to overcome. 
Anyway, I agree with you that the backgound color is only a small part of the user experience, and the other aspects you mentioned are probably way more important.

Two reasons why people react negatively to Bitcoin:
1. They don't understand it and that makes them feel uncomfortable. Deep down they somehow know that this might be a big game changer, and change is scary, especially when it's happening without you.
2. They feel like they have missed out on a big opportunity and now want to rationalize/defend their past decisions by being overly negative and hostile towards Bitcoin. First they laugh at you, then they fight you? Maybe there is something to that saying after all.
@_date: 2014-07-04 08:38:03
In the long run you're probably right. And I agree that it will most likely take decades for that to truly happen. And by that I mean Bitcoin or something based on it replacing the majority of other currencies.

Sounds to me like a 2-of-2 multisig scenario where party 1 holds the first signature and party 2, 3 and 4 each hold the second signature.

Tuesday, August 19th, 2014:
In r/bitcoin's imagination, overnight the bitcoin went from being the currency of tomorrow to a dystopian joke. As the tone of new submissions to the subreddit shifted from gee-whiz to skeptical, attention that had once been thrilling became a source of resentment. Some even worried that bitcoin had been a Ponzi scheme. Beyond the most hardcore users, skepticism has only increased.
The most dedicated bitcoin loyalists maintained their faith, not just in Nakamoto, but in the system he had built. And yet, unmistakably, beneath the paranoia and infighting lurked something more vulnerable, an almost theodical disappointment. But even as the currency's value has continued to drop, they are still investing in the fragile economy.
"You could say it's following Gartner's Hype Cycle," London-based core developer Amir Taaki says, referring to a theoretical technology-adoption-and-maturation curve that begins with a "technology trigger," ascends to a "peak of inflated expectations," collapses into a "trough of disillusionment," and then climbs a "slope of enlightenment" until reaching a "plateau of productivity." By this theory, bitcoin is clambering out of the trough, as people learn to value the infallible code and discard the human drama and wild fluctuations that surround it.
It would be interesting to know what Nakamoto thinks of all this, but he’s not talking. He didn’t respond to emails, and the people who might know who he is say they don’t. 
Tl;dr: [Business as usual.](

Ever wonder why in the "real world" there is this thing called an accredited investor? It's mainly to protect people from losing their money to high risk investments that trick them into buying into their promises.
And yes, the Ethereum team is doing exactly that: They trick people by putting up videos that talk about how Ehtereum is going the change the world by doing everything everyone has ever imagined and more! It's going to change to world! You don't want to miss this opportunity! Also, you better buy now and quickly, otherwise the clock is ticking down and you get less and less for you money!
^^oh ^^and ^^it's ^^not ^^an ^^investment ^^by ^^the ^^way ^^so ^^don't ^^blame ^^us ^^if ^^you ^^never ^^get ^^anything ^^in ^^return ^^for ^^all ^^your ^^bitcoins. ^^kthxbye.
Look, I'm all for a free market. I am a big fan of the fact that Bitcoin enables ordinary people to invest in new ideas and startups, without going through all the legal hurdles of becoming an accredited investor. But this also requires everyone to do their due dilligence, and more importantly, it requires a watchful eye of the community to call out the people who take advantage of all of this. Ehtereum is sketchy at best. If you can't see that, then I can't help you.
@_date: 2014-08-22 15:24:50

@_date: 2014-10-29 20:51:18
This is also my biggest worry. It's scary how most people can't be bothered to do anything that requires any kind of effort unless there's some kind of instant gratification. And even then the majority still doesn't care. 
Luckily, Bitcoin has a lot to offer to people who actually do care, and even more to offer to people who don't have the choice of not caring, because they don't have the alternatives we take for granted. And of course there's also the very real possibility that our current monetary system can not sustain itself forever. Should that point be reached, then people will be forced to start thinking, and they will definitely think about technologies like Bitcoin.
But even ignoring the above, there's no reason to believe that Bitcoin can't be incorporated into products and services that are just as easy to use as all the conventional financial services we have today. All this needs is time. Nobody will use Bitcoin the way we do now in a few years from now if it's still around, that much is certain. 
@_date: 2014-10-27 12:12:52

That is assuming that the distribution of bitcoin users who actively trade on exchanges and users who have no interest in trading stays the same.

A bitcoin balance for any address is the sum of all its inputs minus all its outputs. So every bitcoin is really just the momentary endpoint of a series of entries on a transaction ledger, aka the blockchain. When a newly mined bitcoin is generated that means that there is a new input to the miners address written to the blockchain, and this is the only instance where an input does not need a corresponding output from a different address.

It looks like the transaction isn't propagating properly, so other nodes and miners don't even know about it. Only blockchain.info seems to know about this transaction.
You have two options:
1) Import the priv key from the sending address to a different wallet (not blockchain.info!) and re-send from there. 
2) Re-broadcast the exact same transaction from a different node.
If you want to go for option 2) then here's how you do it: [This]( is your raw transaction data. You can copy/paste and re-broadcast it for example [here](

@_date: 2014-06-17 14:50:06
Yes, there are actually 2^256 / 2^160 = 2^96 private keys on average for every address, where 2^256 is the private key space and 2^160 is the space of possible addresses which is limited by the RIPEMD160 hashing algorithm.
Whether this has any consequences regarding shorter addresses or not I have no idea.

No offense, but it's a pretty poor workaround. Anyone looking at your site will see a donation option and a buy option. If I want to buy the book, I will click on the buy option and not on the donation option.
A good workaround would have been to still have a single buy button, and when the user clicks on it they get presented with a choice between Credit Card or Bitcoin, which then redirects to either Gumroad or Coinbase.

Monetary policy is, in essence, nothing but trying to fight the symptoms of an economic problem by arbitrarily manipulating the money supply. Instead governments should try to solve the underyling structural issues that cause those economic problems, but that of course is not as easy as simply printing more or less money. One might argue that once a government can no longer influence the monetary supply, it will be forced to find real and sustainable solutions.

When I pay with a credit card I use the abstract idea that my creditworthiness can be trusted by a credit card company which then converts this idea of credit into cash which it uses to pay the business I used my credit card at. Funny thing is that this creditworthiness of mine doesn't exist as a real and quantifiable thing, while bitcoin does.

How is it misleading or distracting??
No chargebacks is a very real advantage of bitcoin, something that should greatly benefit merchants. SHOULD! Because as you describe it, that advantage is being negated by arbitrary rules and measurements imposed on you by the company processing your credit card payments.
Nobody is using the argument of no chargebacks to mislead or distract you in any way. Distract from what? From the fact that the credit card payment system is heavely flawed and their payment processors have to take every measure to protect their asses from fraud, and they do that on the backs of the merchants and ultimately their customers? Why would we want to distract from that?
I think it's a valid argument you're making, but don't put terms on it that make it seem like 'the bitcoin community' is using misleading arguments to sell you something, when that's just not the case.

b) A convenient and reliable way to create and manage nlocktime transactions: This would be extremely useful to make sure certain bitcoins will be accessible to certain persons at a certain time in the event that something unexpected should happen to the private keys (e.g. loss of backups) or the holder of said private keys (e.g. death).

That's just stupid. Maybe it's time for people to take securing the digital aspects of their lifes a little bit more seriously? How is that victim blaming? This isn't just about Bitcoin, it's about pretty much all parts of our lifes becoming increasingly digital and online. Being ignorant about the security implications of this development will help no one, except the criminals taking advantage of people's carelessness.
And how the hell is this in any way a fault of Bitcoin? If anything, it's a problem with online services such as blockchain.info not putting enough focus on user security. Maybe they should make 2FA mandatory for all new accounts? But oh noes, imagine the outrage that would cause!
Plus there are very secure online wallets such as greenaddress.it. But nobody is using them because "meh, I know what I'm doing, I'm just gonna use TOR!".

That sounds a lot like circular reasoning to me: You say that to reach consensus within the protocol, the network has to first reach consensus about the protocol. And therefore the network consensus is based on some kind of societal trust?
I think that is somewhat missing the point. The point is that with Bitcoin, the protocol, as fluid as it may be, does not come with an inherent requirement of trust. However with PoS checkpoints, the whole process of reaching a consensus depends on a web of trust. 
Just because the developers can porpose changes to the Bitcoin protocol, doesn't mean that anyone is forced to trust them. Their changes can be ignored, and the network remains unaffected. PoS checkpoints can not be ignored. They affect the network on a fundamental level.

You don't seem to realize what is happeneing here. Let me explain:
On May 25th that somewhat well-known early bitcoin investor guy on bitcointalk made this thread where he was basically bashing all altcoins, telling everyone not to buy into any of them, except for Monero. Because you know, Monero is different and better and all that! Curiously enough he made that posting right after he apparently loaded up on this Monero thing the moment it was available on some exchanges. Whatever. 
It is worth noting that at the time of that posting, Monero traded for 0.006 BTC a piece. It is also worth noting that right now, less than two weeks later, the exchange rate is down to around 0.002 BTC.
Now all these super smart people who thought they found the next big thing, thanks to the kindness of this early adopter guy making a thread telling them about his secrets, they all bought into Monero at highly inflated prices and are now sitting on some substantial losses. Unfortunately they didn't realize that the price was inflated largely due to this investor putting a pretty big amount of money into this latest newest investment venture of his. They also didn't realize that his intention is to make money, and not to promote some kind of new world-changing technology. Welp, there's a lesson to learn there for all of them for sure.
These guys are now literally holding losses in a "currency" that is completely useless for anything other than trading for BTC on a few small exchanges. Monero has absolutely no real life utility at this point, and to top it off it is highly inflationary by design. So unless a lot more people start "investing" into this Monero thing, the price will only go down more. But why should anyone invest into it? Well, of course because it somehow has this privacy feature built-in that might be somewhat better in some regards than what Bitcoin can do with CoinJoin and other anonymization techniques. Right? Well guess what! CoinJoin is for all intents and purposes perfectly fine for 99.999% of all real-life applications where someone would need a certain level of privacy.
Tl;dr: Bagholders got tricked into putting money into highly inflated and highly inflationary thing called Monero. Monero can not be used for anyting right now, and nobody actually has any usage for this better-than-CoinJoin privacy feature that is supposed to differentiate it from Bitcoin. 
I am disappoint!
@_date: 2014-08-20 14:08:24
So what?
@_date: 2014-11-29 13:22:44
Yes, that's true. Because right now the situation is that when I spend my bitcoins, the merchant usually sells them for fiat, which means that by spending them I increase the supply. If the merchant would hold the bitcoins and use them in turn to pay his suppliers, which will also hold the bitcoin to pay their own suppliers and so forth, then me spending my bitcoins would not have a direct effect on the price anymore. But we are still a long way from this being a realistic scenario.
But that's not really the main reason for the volatility. The main reason why the volatility of bitcoin is so high is because the total value of all the bitcoins that are traded on the open market is so low. That is what I meant by low market liquidity. And because the value of the traded bitcoins is so low, it only takes a small change in supply or demand to have a large effect on the price.
So in order to get to a point where bitcoin becomes stable, the total value of all the traded bitcoins would have to grow by a huge factor. And that is only possible if the price also increases by a huge factor. But if the price only increases because everyone is holding, then this will have a limited effect on market liquidity. So we need two things: A big increase in price caused by increased demand, and at the same time a big increase in spending/trading to further increase market liquidity.

Shows 32 confirmations for me. 
@_date: 2014-07-17 12:52:26
Not really: They way confirmations work, faster confirmation times just mean that less hashing power (in relation to the total hashing power of the network) has to be exerted in order to solve a new block. So in turn a quicker confirmation rate adds less confidence to a transaction than a slower confirmation rate.
Of course one could argue that even if a 1 minute confirmation time is a lot less meaningful than a 10 minute confirmation time, it's still better to have some form of confidence after 1 minute as opposed to still having a completely unconfirmed transaction. That is somewhat true, but the main problem is that shorter confirmation times increase the orphaning rate for new blocks tremendously, which means that even though some nodes see a transaction as confirmed after 1 minute, that block has a relatively high risk of getting orphaned, thus adding an additional factor of uncertainty to every confimation. In the end it's a trade-off, and Satoshi obviously weighted the pros and cons in favour of a 10 minute window.

It's hard to have an opinion on Ethereum because, well, up to this point it's all just promises: There might never be a working product, and even if there will be, it might be completely impractical due to myriads of unforseen reasons. They promise to be able to do ANYYYYYYTHIIIING you've ever dreamt of and more with Ethereum. Unfortunately that also means that ANYYYYYTHIIIIING they've ever thought of and more can go wrong. 
So far its main feature seems to be amassing a lot of bitcoins for their team, while giving their "investors" nothing but a redeemable coupon for a bunch of tokens that have no demonstrable utility so far. And how convinient for them that there is no cap on the supply on Ether during the pre-sale: This means they can get as many bitcoins as people are willing to give them, while the investors have no idea how big of a share they even receive for the pice they paid. 
TL;DR: They are selling a promise to give you some tokens sometime this or next year that might work as intended or might not work at all, and they can't tell you how many tokens in total there will be until the pre-sale is over. Sketchy to say the least. But it seems that greed and blind hope is a very common investment strategy in this space...

This is all true. But exploiting one or possibly multiple attack vectors in a specific modification made by a specific supplier of an android phone is already a highly targeted attack. Of course this is a possibility, it's just very unlikely to ever lose bitcoins to anything like that.
It is immensely more likely to lose bitcoins because the phone they were stored on was rooted, and an application managed to get root privileges, either because the user gave it root, or because it exploited the SU manager. And because there are less than a handful SU managers that are commonly used on android phones, this would also not be a targeted attack and therefore a lot more attractive to a possible hacker.

Don't worry, that will never happen.
@_date: 2014-05-22 15:36:12
Doubling your fees won't make a difference regarding confirmation times under normal circumstances: As others have pointed out already, the average confirmation time is around 10 minutes per confirmation. This is by design. You can not force a quicker confirmation by including a higher fee.
As long as you pay the suggested minimal fee, your transaction is very likely to get a confirmation within the next 10 minutes. However, 10 minutes is an average, and due to statistical reasons, there can be some faster and also some slower confirmations from time to time. Again, this is an inherent outcome of how the protocol is designed and is not related to the transaction fee. 
Also note that the transaction fee is only relevant for the first confirmation. After that, your transaction will be always included in all further blocks (confirmations), even if you didn't pay a transaction fee in the first place.
@_date: 2014-11-06 17:29:23
Yes, we can tell.
@_date: 2014-05-12 13:15:45
That's a good point. But then again, I feel a lot more comfortable carrying around bitcoins than I do carrying around cash: If I lose my wallet or if I get robbed, my cash gone. If I lose my phone or if it gets stolen, my bitcoins will still be there when I get home and restore my backup. So I usually have more money on me in bitcoins than I have in cash.

True. And also kind of my point: There were and still are good reasons to be sceptical regarding Bitcoin. But these reasons are obviously not strong enough to make the sceptics go "yeah this won't work, whatever, time to go fishing". Instead it makes them go "hmm this really shouldn't work, right guys? Guys? What? You don't agree with me? Well listen, you are wrong and here is why!!" :)

Well, this is where you are wrong: There will in fact only ever be 21 million bitcoins, with bitcoin being the arbitrarily divisible base unit. 
A bitcoin is like a pizza: There will ever only be the same one pizza, no matter how many slices you cut it into. And even if the current convention is to slice every pizza into 8 pieces, tomorrow we can all agree to change this convention and instead slice every pizza into 16 pieces. This doesn't mean that there is suddenly more pizza to go around, it only means that we now have more slices to share.

Hmm, I would say the point of metcalf's law is the more users, the more utility. With every new user that joins the network, the utility for every other user increases, because they now all have the potential to connect/interact with this new user. And that potential is increasing exponentially. That doesn't mean that this necessarily has to lead to more interactions per user.
When I choose VISA over Diners Club, that doesn't automatically mean that I am going to use it more. But I still prefer VISA because it is more useful/valuable to me because of its wider acceptance network.

No need to add a disclaimer about using bitcoins yourself. I don't judge an argument based on who is presenting it. But honestly, all your points are extremely short-sighted:
**Volatility** is a side-effect of a largely illiquid market (compared to more matured markets). This will obviously change with increased adoption. So it all plays out nicely: Incentive for early adopters as a volatile high-risk/high-reward investment, incentive for late adopters as a more stable currency.
**Anonymity** is not at all hard to achieve using Bitcoin. And it will only get easier. Darkwallet is a first step to make one-button anonymity available to everyone, and many more such applications and services will follow.
**Central players** like payment processors are absolutely ok. Nobody has to be relying on them for anything. I know I'm not. They provide a service anyone is free to use or to ignore. Market mechanisms will make sure that the quality of this service is guaranteed.
**Whales selling** - see Volatility.
**As mobile as your credit card**? Well that's nice. But your card is not your money. If your payment processor decides you are not allowed to use your credit card outside of your country, then you are shit out of luck.
**No consumer protection** is the only argument I can somewhat agree with. For now, using bitcoins means more responsibility for the consumer. Of course there's already a lot of development happening here: Multisig escrow services, insurance services, etc. This is just an intermediare issue. And even if it wasn't, it would still be a minor disadvantage.
**Too confusing for regular Joe**? Sure. We're in an extremely early adoption stage. Nobody knew how to use the internet before AOL. What makes you think this won't change?

* Positive spin: Wall Street is setting the foundation for their large scale involvement in the near future. They're not getting in at 
the top.
* Neutral spin: Selling pressure due to increased merchant adoption, while consumer adoption is still lagging behind. People currently just spend more bitcoins than they buy.
* Negative spin: Big investors have a negative short and mid term outlook on the market and are reducing their positions.
* Bitcoin is dead spin: Bitcoin is dead.

Exactly. And every time you either "create a new address" or send bitcoins it will use up one of those 100 pre-made addresses. So your backup should usually be good for about 100 transactions.

Except Bitcoin is not a car. And that's actually a quite important little detail too:
If I drive a Ford, I don't care much if other people drive a Ford as well or not. They can drive a BMW, a Dodge, a Hyundai, a Fiat or a Ferrari. It doesn't impact me in any notable way. 
With a digital currency it's a little bit different though: The utility of a currency is closely related to its network effect. That means that every time I own some "exotic" currency noone else uses, I put myself in a worse position by limiting the utility of my money. That's why anyone who owns digital currency not just for speculation, but for its value as an actual currency will have no reason to own anything but the most dominant "coin". Which is Bitcoin. This also means that anyone investing into the crypto-currency economy has every incentive to focus on Bitcoin as well. And this simple dynamic is the reason why it is very very likely that Bitcoin will emerge as the single winner from all of this in the end.

Sure, it's good to follow things like that. But that's no reason to scoff at other people when they keep approaching the problem from a different angle in order to improve Bitcoin. The only reason for doing that is if you're trying to pump your altcoin by declaring it the final say in the matter. Which it isn't. It's one of many approaches that comes with its own issues.
And the worst issue for most people is very simple: It's an altcoin introducing a new blockchain. As others have already pointed out, more blockchains only dillute the utility of all the other blockchains, which is counter-productive unless it's the only choice. Which again, it isn't. So stop your "omg just use monero" spam in threads that are trying to have a productive discussion. Thanks.

I think it's important to add that for now, the biggest incentive for miners to include any transactions in a block is the fact that if they don't, the utility of Bitcoin would be reduced, which would have a negative effect on the price. And that of course would be bad for miners because it would make mining less profitable.
So as long as the transaction fees are very small compared to the block reward, the market mechanisms to set a "fair" fee structure will not be effective.

I wonder if people are not aware of the fact that companies like Visa or Mastercard actually demand their logos to be visible (often with specific requirements) in both online shops as well as brick and mortar stores that accept their credit cards.

Uhm, you're not supposed to use paper wallets or cassscius coins when paying with bitcoins. You do know how bitcoin works, don't you?

But Bitcoin IS already used for exactly that, and with darkwallet and similar wallets plus mixing services, it's just as anonymous as darkcoin. So why use something different instead of something that's already used and works?
