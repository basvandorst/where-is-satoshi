Oh I see, fair enough.

Honestly I don't pay too much attention to the short-term events in any one country for a few reasons:
1. My portfolio is diversified globally, so I'm reasonably insulated against individual countries doing stupid things.
2. I'm still early in my career so I expect to go through the odd recession. I wouldn't be surprised if we are right on the cusp of one here in the UK, what with Brexit looming and record levels of consumer debt. Even so, the long-term outlook is positive, so providing I can ride them out I should do alright.
3. Some of my investment is in government bonds, which are obviously much safer than stocks. I will increase the proportion going into bonds as I get closer to retirement, which should protect me in case a recession occurs at the point I want to retire.

Ok lets see. I live in the UK. According to that website there are 82 companies in the UK that accept Bitcoin [1]. Companies House tells me there are some 3.6 million companies registered in the UK that are not in the process of liquidation or dissolution [2]. That's 0.002% of British companies that accept Bitcoin according to your source. I think my point stands that there are "very few companies that take Bitcoin".

Eh. I find cryptocurrencies quite interesting but I don't hang around here much. My view is basically that Bitcoin is an incredibly risky investment. Sure, it might go up by several orders of magnitude, but equally it might crash down by similar degrees. People have made huge sums from Bitcoin, just as people have lost huge sums from it.
If I take a long-term outlook, where do I think Bitcoin is going to be in 30 years? Who the hell knows. It could quite literally be anywhere. On the other hand, the stock market is backed by useful work, and is constantly being pushed up by improved productivity and increasing population sizes. It's a reasonably safe assumption that in 30 years the stock market is going to be well above where it is now, so that's where I put my money.
I don't want to shit on everyone who uses cryptocurrencies, but putting money in Bitcoin is closer to gambling than it is to investing, so it's not something I would see as particularly wise to buy into.

Is it? Cryptocurrencies are still in their infancy. There's really no telling what's going to happen over the coming decades, but I don't think it's a stretch to suggest that the bubble could irreversibly burst.

Obviously the hardware itself has value, but the work they are doing is simply infrastructure to support the currency. I wouldn't say that contributes to any intrinsic value the currency has.


Maybe if you're a drug dealer. For everyone else it's a risk because you've got no one to turn to if things go wrong. You don't have to look very far to find examples of people being hacked and losing everything.


That doesn't imply there's anything meaningful backing it. How much of that is people speculating?


There are very few companies that take Bitcoin at the moment, so as a currency it's not that useful. Refer to my previous point regarding the dollar value.


This is fair. So what's the long-term value of the technology? Hard to say. If it never penetrates into general use then it might just fizzle out. Governments are going to resist it because they can't control it, which you're obviously starting to see with China. 
Truth is no one can predict what Bitcoin is going to do in the long term without speculating. I'm not judging anyone for getting into Bitcoin, but it's so far above my risk tolerance that I wouldn't consider buying into it at the moment.

The hype surrounding bitcoin is really quite something. There's nothing of any real value backing it so why should anyone reasonably expect to make long-term gains from it? I think I'll stick to the stock market which is actually backed by people doing useful work.
