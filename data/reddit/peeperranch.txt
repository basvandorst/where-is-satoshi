Here come the capital controls...I have a friend that attempted to send a Bank of America wire online to MtGox  last week and was denied.  
the message from BoA: "According to our records, this account was previously suspended from the Funds Transfer Service therefore it cannot be added at this time. For information relating to this account, please contact a Bank of America customer service representative."

Will do...I keep watching the wallet, but amazingly nothing has arrived yet !   I might need to offer some significant discounts...

Keep in mind it's 4am in Japan.  It may just be a server crash.

Sorry, we don't sell horses to eat, but you can try it in France.

Same thing happened to me.  Been waiting 2 hours so far.  
They are likely getting an unprecedented number of withdrawal requests, so the backlog theory seems reasonable.

I look forward to hearing your presentation
Here are a few other common concerns, the first 2 of which may be Extinction Events: 
  - Possible displacement at some point by a superior alternative currency.
  - Government Bans on usage, capital controls   
  - Slow consumer adoption...it's great for merchants, but why is it better for [non-investor] consumers than credit cards?

Just for argument's sake, why not make the blocks every 30 seconds?  Or 5 seconds?  As OP asked, what's the downside?  If you cut difficulty by a factor of 20, you still will have an incredibly high security level with 2 or 3 confirmations.     
Not suggesting this be done near-term, but what about 5 years from now when networks are more robust?  Is there anything inherently "wrong" with speeding up block generation?

And bitcoin is helping drive Reddit.   I became a user of bitcoin before Reddit.  
Seeing other businesses posted here certainly inspired me to add bitcoin as a payment vehicle.  I don't think I would have considered it otherwise, as there are not many people in the horse world looking to spend bitcoin...yet.   
The benefit to small business in the future is tremendous though, saving 3% on CC fees and bypassing the banks.
Every little icon helps solve the chicken and egg problem.

It's called "climbing the wall of worry."   Tens of thousands of people have recently opened exchange accounts and have started testing the waters, but scared to fully jump in because of the recent crash.     
Every small pullback is getting bought, and people are starting to panic that they might miss their second chance to get in below 200.

mine just showed up.  Took 2 1/2 hours to process.

You nailed it.  I saw that too.  I think a benevolent force (Winklevoss twins?) is attempting to stabilize the currency by bracketing the price with large orders but their upper bracket ($130) got taken out.    
Right now someone has 10,000 BTC ready to sell at $150.  That might be the new wall.
