I don't understand the hype with the robinhood crypto stuff - if you can't withdraw with crypto, what can you do? 
Can you buy anything with it, or is it just 'exposure' to BTC/etc? BC that's shit, right?

Just sending it from BRD wallet via the QR code. I've tried from Exodus, too - just pasting the code, and it doesn't work.

Thanks for your reply! I'm from the U.S. - But I work with people from the UK, Mexico, and Australia

whatever, i wish they'd teach me that arbitrage trick
@_date: 2018-03-31 19:30:52
just spend it when you want to and buy some when you want...or try to get paid with it. 
Regardless, it needs liquidity to grow, and if everyone just sat around with their thumbs up their ass, it wouldn't do anything.
Also: Hodl is stupid - can we please stop?

I mean, a lot of people in Africa *also* view it as a get rich quick scheme...why would it be that much different from the West? 
@_date: 2018-03-15 23:23:27
well, at least they're loosening regulations for big banks

That's what maduro says...but the reality is that he is forcing organizations to accept the petro.
What's really happening is that miners and holders alike are being robbed and kidnapped by state actors, with some even being forced to set their own equipment in gov facilities and rat on other miners. 
"all coins will be accepted" according to a literal monster who has consistently lied through his teeth throughout this whole "adoption" process. Get real.

Speaking with those closer to miners in the country, plus numerous articles on the subject, and numerous reports

I believe the proper emoji is ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

Well, two tokens, one ERC20 token, and one NEM mosaic. The ERC20 token has a few transactions, but the gov said they made a last minute switch to the nem blockchain a few days ago....the nem blockchain has zero transactions, despite claims that $735m was raised on the first day (with a broken website that doesn't actually allow you to purchase any) 
There's no telling what this is beyond a publicity stunt. 
Meanwhile Venezuelan bitcoin miners are being robbed and kidnapped...

The shitcoin revolution is in full swing
@_date: 2018-02-23 14:12:27
The Petro is absolutely featured in this article - Maduro is FORCING organization to accept the shitcoin, oh and also accept other cryptos, maybe.
He literally created a miner registry under the guise of recruiting Petro miners...only to kidnap, extort, beat, and force them to not only install their own equipment in gov facilities, but also rat out other miners.
But yah, adoption or whatever
@_date: 2018-02-23 13:46:04
This is not adoption. This is exploitation....they are lying - they say they have raised $735m on the first day....with nothing to prove that (empty NEM blockchain, empty ERC20 blockchain), they kidnapping btc miners and holders, their website to buy the petro doesn't even work, they have no support from their allies. They have two separate whitepapers, one in spanish says it will be an ERC20 token, the other in english says it will be a NEM token, they said it was going to be pegged to a barrel of oil, their own national assembly deemed that illegal, so they made up their own price....it's a complete shitshow. 
 it's all a farce, and it is definitely not good for btc or the crypto-community at all. we don't want this. 
@_date: 2018-03-14 01:49:37
I think it's more like "oh wow this literal monster has come to 'save' puerto ricans with unfulfilled promises and a dream" 
I mean, one of the quotes from this gang crypto-saints is "what happened here was a perfect storm"
This is more than 'leftists' qq'ing about the mega rich - this is an out of touch group of self-proclaimed do-gooders with sketchy histories trying to build their own paradise on top of a tragedy from which people are still recovering. 
@_date: 2018-02-23 13:34:43
This x100 - Gov is kidnapping and extorting btc miners, claims they have raised $735m (with a broken website and no transactions on the blockchain), it's not even pegged to oil.
They have two different whitepapers suggesting the coin will be on two different blockchains (ERC20 token on the Spanish whitepaper, NEM Mosaic on the English whitepaper)
The whole thing is bullshit. THis is a bad look for cryptos and no one should consider this 'adoption.' it's exploitation.

video game moderators told me botting is bad

Translated: I'm receiving in this moment complaints from the state of Anzoátegui, that people are being kidnapped by security organizations from the state, who know they have bitcoin in order to rob them. Please all the bitcoin owners take care. Beware! This this getting uglier than I could imagine.

I really doubt an Iranian bitcoin ban would impact prices at all - the volume is probably so low there that it wouldn't even matter. 
Iran's currency is plummeting, however, so I am sure that impacts their decision to ban cryptos
@_date: 2018-04-30 15:25:21
I'm curious about this too - I've had instant ATM transactions with wallets unrelated to the ATM - In the same ATM on separate occasions, I've had to wait up to 30 minutes to retrieve my money. 
@_date: 2018-04-23 20:24:44
It's not like a ban on crypto can help them - their currency went from 1:36,000 to 1:60,000 in a week....I'm sure LocalBitcoin volume is exploding 
@_date: 2018-04-10 16:36:49
I wish the bull run would hurry up

There's a BTC ATM in McAllen...and Miami? 
On a side note - there's 3 in Mexico City...and they're all in comic book stores.

but they want "the tech behind bitcoin"
