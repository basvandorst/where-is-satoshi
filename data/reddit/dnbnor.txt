Listen, what these puppetmasters are doing is manipulating the market and telling when to jump. I have noticed that if you compare big ups and downs on the Altcoins you will see that the timing is to cool the market or heaten before a new timezone is going on shift. Buying alot of Ripple before the Koreans wake ut or cooling the market so people wake up to a up market. Or selling alot of bitcoins so when people in a timezone starts they will think that bitcoin is down, we have to sell . And with help from Coinbase they managed to get people into BCH. All in all what is happening is that people sell bitcoins for altcoins in a period of caos. I'm 100% convinced that in a few days these puppetmasters will sell all their altcoins and buy cheap bitcoins. This is a game. The bitcoin hype is recruting a lot of ignorant noobs to the market. And media is saying there is a crash and people are tossing money out the window. It's like the .com in early 2000. Noobs must remember that from all these Altcoins there is maybe 2-3 alternatives with a future, the rest is a fancy homepage as of today. They are not something you should sell your bitcoins for. (my enrish might not be the best, but I hope you get my point)

just after I wrote this I checked the Ripple price. It's gone up from '68610 to '82774 in a few minutes.  Just check 2017-12-21 00:00 . Big buy , and BCH is down to $3460 . Nice price for the Koreans to start trading off their Bitcoins for Bitcoin Crash.

Why is btc price falling to under $19.000 before the trade starts ? Can someone explain ? Altcoins goes up. Is this a last wave to get people to sell their btc to altcoins ? I really don't understand this game.

Just because why not, I'm currently working on a community currency framework. I got the idea after watching the John Wick movies. The idea is to do off grid transactions. You only need one computer in your community. It's currenctly in a [beta]( The framework is called 52blocksnet.
