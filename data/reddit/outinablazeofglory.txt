More secure?
@_date: 2018-01-29 16:15:22
what if you only traded on chain? why would bitcoin users avoid these coins?

Cool. The Wikimedia Foundation is also doing cool stuff. And they seem kind of strapped for cash.
@_date: 2018-01-30 13:47:42
They should send a donation to the Electronic Frontier Foundation. And Wikipedia.

So if they were all sent to one address, then a transaction was made from that address, people wouldn't accept them. But if you laundered it a lot it would be hard to tell if it was stolen. And why exactly would people or bots or corporations refuse the stolen bitcoin? Wouldn't it be worth as much as any other bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-01-29 15:29:30


I assume you mean:


Also, wouldn't you be able to easily see if it went to one address that you shouldn't accept them? What exactly happens to the value of the funds?

Probably mixed up the USD and BTC fields.

I mean if you aren't paying for the power, then it's a good deal.

Place more commemorative coins on him please. They don’t have to have the bitcoin symbol on them, or have a bitcoin private key code on them, but I think it’d be adorable.

Man, there must be a glory hole around here, all these satoshi symbols and phone numbers.
@_date: 2019-03-05 13:16:42
Or almost any radio frequency. I could use either lightning or a traditional bitcoin payment, and negotiate it over shortwave with a Chinese dissident.
@_date: 2019-03-05 14:21:39
Hell people all over the world could bankroll dissidents in authoritarian countries. The North Korean government isn't the only group that can sneak money into North Korea.

DON'T TAKE OUT A FUCKING MORTGAGE ON YOUR HOUSE YOU GODDAMN IDIOT. Sell your coins and repay that mortgage immediately. DON'T INVEST WHAT YOU CAN'T AFFORD TO LOSE. You'll be happier with like $100 invested if you really want to invest a lot. You can afford to lose $100. And you'll feel less worried all the time. Please dear god just repay the second mortgage. And it IS a currency, not an investment fund, you can make some money with it, since it's so volatile, but only idiots buy that much just to hope it goes up. Buy a computer or some shit with it, but don't take out a second mortgage.
@_date: 2017-08-23 15:25:00
Congratulations, you have a shit ton of money!
I would recommend selling the bulk of it quickly, unless you have something you are interested in buying with it right away, or want to invest some in the hopes of it appreciating more. Have fun with your 20k.

I don't want to watch it right now. Did he actually do it?!
@_date: 2017-11-02 13:31:45
Doesn't make it less stupid.
E: The fact it paid off doesn't mean it's less stupid. Taking out a home loan and blowing it on lottery tickets is still dumb even you're incredibly lucky. Even if bitcoin as an asset continued to increase in value, he could still lose his keys.

Well, Minecraft has an EULA to prevent the more egregious behavior. They actually distribute a hashed list of IPs/domains/public keys to clients. Clients will not connect to these servers. You really have to fuck up to get that kind of ban though.
@_date: 2017-09-01 16:43:31
Hmm, maybe I'll pull the money out of my ass like that guy who found a 5btc wallet in a cd in his garage.
@_date: 2017-09-18 12:38:33
I didn't pay anything. I'm confused.
@_date: 2017-09-20 14:48:52


Tie a flash drive full of nodes up in a condom, then put it at the bottom of a bowl of food in a speakeasy set up. Perfect.
@_date: 2017-09-01 15:07:30
As soon as I see signs of the next one occuring, I will go apeshit and tell my parents to invest in bitcoin.

RUN! She clearly doesn't know how to manage risk. Uses the other suggestions to try to get her to calm down about it, but don't let her touch your 401k. If she tries to go behind your back, you should probably break things off. Otherwise just try to help her learn to be more cautious. Don't end up like the idiots who took out a second mortgage on their house and spend there days dodging aneurysms whenever the price dips.

I think we need to figure out a way to lower the size of the blockchain. It's getting to big for it to be practical for most people to run full nodes. Maybe every time the mining reward halves, or would have halved in the far future, we subject the first block after halving to extra scrutiny, and record this scrutiny this special block, then we have a pseudo genesis block. You can keep the whole chain if you want, but we have successfully minimized the trust required in this block, allowing you to only keep it and blocks after it. This, coupled with perhaps encoding blocks in a newer, more efficient way, could lower the needed storage for the chain. We have a 1000 days. That's two years to map things out. It may be ambitious, but I think we can do it.
@_date: 2017-09-20 12:41:37
We can send letters to all the important people at Amazon saying we want to buy something, listing something specific, but can't. List workarounds, and how much they cost in fees etc. Show them how easy it would be for them to set up, and how much more money they would make by accepting BTC directly.
@_date: 2017-09-12 14:00:53
This is ridiculous. It makes sense to demurrage names, like in namecoin, but currency? If people can't rely on stored value, then it fails as a currency.

I would, but I can't get an account on the major exchanges as I am under 18.
