That's interesting if it's true.
@_date: 2018-05-18 05:08:49
I would have a hardware wallet, but since I can't review the code running on any of them... I'm not comfortable using them.
@_date: 2018-05-18 05:05:52
How does anyone?
@_date: 2018-05-17 12:57:36
Agreed. It isn't a solution.
@_date: 2018-05-17 06:56:52


Why would I be screwed? The 2 email services are meant to serve as a back-up. As I said, I already have the word seed memorized.


It what universe is any of that going on where it would be safe for me to use Bitcoin at all? And for that matter, wouldn't the hacker have to care first? Why am I being targeted in this scenario? I'm aware that it isn't impossible for me to be compromised... I'm saying it's damn unlikely, and the potential for the 12-word seed written on a piece of paper being found, lost, or stolen is greater.


This isn't true if you log out. Every log-in requires 2-factor.


Okay, does that mean that it's your family's Bitcoin, or yours? I'm not interested in my wife deciding one day that my Bitcoin will go very nicely with her new life in the Cayman Islands. Or that my daughter decides to help herself to some Bitcoin because she thinks she deserves it.


And where is this puzzle written down? In a safe? Folded in a book?
 A safety-deposit box? This is what I'm trying to avoid. I don't want something that can be lost, stolen, destroyed... and now in your example, gotten to work on by whoever has decided that my Bitcoin is worth figuring out the answers on this page. Oh, and by the way, we only need to figure out about 6 of the words, because we'll be able to brute-force the rest.
No offense, we all have different areas of comfort and do our best to come up with the best answers we can... but this solution sounds like an absolute nightmare. The last thing I want to do is put my family through a forced game of Memory Lane weeks or months after my death. And until then I can spend my time *hoping* that the hoops I've set up for them to jump through aren't too high. And that's the *best* possible scenario. I don't know how much you have, but is it enough for someone to want to steal? How many family members do you have? Could any one of them decide that solving the riddle privately would be much more profitable that solving it at the dinner table, and then having to share the inheritance with the other 6 people?

God I hope you're kidding.
@_date: 2018-05-18 07:03:36


Hi, honest question. What does this mean?
@_date: 2018-05-17 11:37:08


Please go back, and read what I wrote. Then we can talk.
@_date: 2018-05-17 12:49:45


that might be true... sorry, having a rough night debating this.
@_date: 2018-05-18 05:15:41
I love how you tell me that doing this is risky, but can't tell me why. It just is.
@_date: 2018-05-17 12:51:40
It's great, but makes the word-seed left for next-of-kin worthless.
@_date: 2018-05-18 05:05:40
Then I'll get a new one... do you think they would shut down overnight?
@_date: 2018-05-17 07:33:02
Thank you for your help and feedback... honest question; if I have to securely deliver my password to them *encrypted with their public key* couldn't I simply include the 12 word seed in the message instead of the password? I mean is there an advantage one way or another?
@_date: 2018-05-18 05:06:22
How does anyone?
@_date: 2018-05-18 05:12:56
OMG... that's why I'm making a back up!
@_date: 2018-05-17 07:35:43


Hence the back-up.
@_date: 2018-05-18 12:46:56
Ahh, thanks for the explanation. Fair enough.
@_date: 2018-05-18 05:14:26
You explain how ever said that I wanted to "leave my seed with email services" and then explain how "there are a ton of copies that can get me hacked".
@_date: 2018-05-17 04:23:21
Okay fair enough.
But in addition to my stated objectives, I'd like to also have a trusted person deliver an encrypted message to my next of kin in the event of my death. For this reason, I can't have the delivered message give access to an encrypted wallet, as they will not have my password. However I *can* encrypt the 12-word seed with *their* public key, and then arrange to have that message delivered to them in the event of my death, and know that they will have access to what I have left them.
@_date: 2018-05-17 06:01:46


How is it wildly insecure? Where's the point of failure?
@_date: 2018-05-17 06:30:32
Are you saying that a better solution would be to freely share the 12-word seed with my next of kin, and then arrange to have my password delivered to them in the event of my death?
@_date: 2018-05-17 03:55:15
Thanks for the upvote, care to explain?
@_date: 2018-05-17 06:09:04
Exactly. Tax implications are strange too... do you have a tax liability if your memory fails you that day?
@_date: 2018-05-17 11:36:12
@_date: 2018-05-17 07:40:48
Oh no, I have no problem with that. In fact I'm doing that right now. What I'm not okay with is having anything that can be lost, or stolen that is in plain-text. In other words, If I have 12 bitcoin on a paper wallet, or a wallet with a word seed written on a piece of paper, I in essence have $100,000 cash sitting in a $200 safe I got from Wal-mart.


You're right, I didn't mean that, but that's what I wrote. I meant no physical *liability*.
@_date: 2018-05-17 11:29:34


You're a fuckin' idiot. Did you see my address on this page??


Oh okay... thanks for the heads up.


WHAT HAPPENS TO MY BITCOIN IF I'M KILLED IN A CAR ACCIDENT??
Oh, you got nothin'? That's what I thought.
@_date: 2018-05-17 06:12:34
And you waste your cake-day saying some inane shit like that? How could it be burned? Did you even read the post?
@_date: 2018-05-17 07:42:53
Real constructive fucktard. The password was never going into webmail. Thanks for paying attention.
@_date: 2018-05-17 09:26:23
Honestly, I like this idea but...
From this [article](


But mostly, I simply don't like the idea of knowing that all of my wealth is sitting on a piece of paper in a building that could be compromised.
@_date: 2018-05-17 12:53:53
You're a idiot.
@_date: 2018-05-17 11:35:24
It's amazing how much people can read and blow right past it and come up with a completely different argument that I never made.
@_date: 2018-05-17 11:46:57
Thanks, I'll check it out.
@_date: 2018-05-17 11:25:11
omg... I'm not relying on the email service for storing my bitcoin, I'm relying on Microsoft and Google's email services to be around for the next decade... but if they aren't that's okay... I'll find a new service to replace them.
*I have my word seed memorized!!*
I'm using the email services as a backup *in case I forget*.
@_date: 2018-05-17 11:36:00
I did plan on having multiple services just in case.
@_date: 2018-05-17 06:00:30
Yeah? How?
@_date: 2018-05-18 05:06:10
@_date: 2018-05-17 06:05:40


I have two different wallets with 12 words each, so I'm right there with ya!
@_date: 2018-05-17 11:27:24
Umm... I don't know. I'm interested though.
@_date: 2018-05-18 11:04:43
cool... it's trolly af in here. :)
@_date: 2018-05-17 14:06:44
...and as expected you address *nothing*.
@_date: 2018-05-18 05:14:50
Very constructive. Thanks.
@_date: 2018-05-18 07:04:45
Umm... Seriously? It's called redundancy. It's so if I *do* hit my head, I can still restore the information.
@_date: 2018-05-17 07:47:25
Absolutely 100% irrelevant to the subject at hand.
@_date: 2018-05-17 03:59:39


Couldn't I forget the password just as easily as I could forget the seed?


And why is that better?
@_date: 2018-05-17 11:34:25


Yeah, I've thought about this quite a bit, and I'm open to suggestions.


I would *not* be completely screwed, as I'm not used the email service for keeping the word seed. The word seed is memorized... I'm using the email service as a back-up.
@_date: 2018-05-17 11:46:10
@_date: 2018-05-17 06:03:41


I really hope English isn't your first language.
@_date: 2018-05-18 11:03:05
blah blah blah
@_date: 2018-05-17 12:55:46
Yeah, that's true. It was a mistake to say that, I was trying to keep things simple. But yes, I want to leave my Bitcoin to my next-of-kin, and want a way to do it without the typical problems that come with it.
@_date: 2018-05-17 06:16:39

"Doing X is dumb, but I won't bother to say why!"
Good job.
@_date: 2018-05-17 05:58:29


I didn't say this in the original post because I thought it might complicate matters. But that's a good point, and it's exactly what prompted all of this thought process in the first place. I was concerned about the fact that if I have Bitcoin, and I am killed in a car accident, it would be lost forever. How *does* one leave Bitcoin to a loved one in the event of their death, without providing that loved one the means of depriving you of your Bitcoin today?
In other words, how to you leave someone Bitcoin that they can *only* access if you are dead?
Well, the first step would be making sure that there is nothing for them to steal from you. That means getting rid of any paper wallets or word seeds.
Second, you would need a person, or a service of some sort to deliver an encrypted message to the loved one in the event of your death. The message would have to be encrypted, because you could not trust any of the people involved (before or after your death). So you would want to have encrypted the 12-word seed for yourself (in case you forgot it) as I described in the original post... and you'd want to have the 12-word seed *also* encrypted with *their* public key for them to decrypt with their private key in the event of your death.

You didn't read what I wrote if you think I want to store coins on a free email client.
@_date: 2018-05-17 12:47:55
I'm not an expert, but I think this is a problem affecting html and how it affects built-in encryption... different from adding text that was encrypted offline.


@_date: 2018-05-17 05:27:43


Yeah, I've done that a couple time... it feels good doesn't it?
@_date: 2018-05-17 11:45:14


You're right, I'm sorry. Nothing in your post warranted my response of saying you were a fuckin' idiot.
I've been replying to people all night in these threads that a feel like are either A, trying to discuss the matter, B, don't understand what I'm talking about, or C, talking shit and making fun/trolling. I think some of that frustration spilled onto you.
Again, sorry.
@_date: 2018-05-18 05:11:45
And how does anyone else protect themselves from that risk? Do you think Microsoft OneDrive and Google Drive are really at risk of shutting down their service.... and shutting down their service overnight... and shutting down their service overnight on the same day that I slip and hit my head?
Just say you don't like the idea, and that you have no good reason.
@_date: 2018-05-17 08:45:04


You didn't answer the question.
A 12-word seed backup, can be the equivalent of hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash.


My concern is not making sure I don't lose the backup, my concern is that someone else may find it.
@_date: 2018-05-18 11:03:42
Yeah, you're right. Who am I again?
