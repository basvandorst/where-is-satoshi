The front running country in terms of investors/per capita is preparing bans!
"is this the reaaaaason for the duuuuumb dip" &lt;- insert cartman voice to op.

Satoshi N. Is laughing all the way to his bank when he cashed in 1mil btc for real currency.

Financial backing, you mean retail investors who only know of Bitcoin when they first invest?
There has been a slight trend latetly where total market cap % held by Bitcoin is getting smaller.. nevertheless more and more money is comming in to Crypto.. and BTC is still the Nr 1 choice for investors, but not for people who want to transact with crypto.

I did not become a millionaire in a day, and thats not the case.. but my family has been reinvesting in gold ever since the late 80s.. its outperformed USD inflation and gained value!
Gold rush from the 1800s are certainly over, but a safe place to store cash which you dont plan reinvest in to stock market/real estate or new business ventures.
Gold has a track record dating since the first civilizations of Mesopotamia.

I´m not schizophrenic, the world is more sane than you think.
And me(family) have been holding gold since the 80s.
But thank you for your fear mongering.

I bought in at 17,000k i one day aspire to be like him.
Am i right guys!?

So a product goes up 50,000,000%, which has yet to prove that it works.. let alone outperform fast USD dollar transactions.
All that while the founder mined 1mil btc, and disappeared?
I bet he cashed out every single bitcoin he had.
BTW what your post is telling me, "I never really really believed in it.. and here i am just fear of missing out and bought some 4-5 years later.

Executive Order 6102? hahah yea that might happen.. sure as hell might happen to crypto.
Whats your point?
That order could be made at any time at given point for any kind of "asset"
@_date: 2017-12-14 14:18:00
Whats your bitcoin amount?
@_date: 2017-12-14 13:47:05
how many bitcoins you holding?
@_date: 2017-12-14 13:26:05
 Vision? Guy made 1mil bitcoins, let the dumb money run the price up and then just disappeared.
He probably wants to stay private, because he probably cashed in for some fine fiat money to live the life.
Bad image for him, the bitcoin founder.

good job.

Not a single person could give + points to bitcoin argument other than 
"making puns" 
Reddit stay reddit, dumb money stay dumb.

Traders can only MAKE money if they "sell"
You mean "close"
You cant lose money if you don´t close, you can´t make money if you don´t close.

Deflation? Cryptos get created every day
@_date: 2017-12-14 14:47:43
Goverment can seize anything, whether you encrypt it, hide it, store it, place it in your butthole.. goverment can switch off the crypto scene in a flash.
So much delusion, its scary..
What matters is you and your 0.84btc wont do shit with, neither buy or become a millionaire on.

Really? my money has never been hacked in a bank, my bank gave me lending for my dream house/dream boat..
also when i return the money in 10 years the inflation of money and my ever so slightly raising yearly salary will make my credit easier and easier to pay off
I love my bank..
I wonder how lending will work with a non inflationary currency like Bitcoin on an ever growing population.
P.S this picture is the typical "Propaganda" used to sway peoples opinions in triggering their fear.
Helped Hitler come on to power, Helped Communism, Perhaps this will help Bitcoins price to stay high or get higher
@_date: 2018-05-18 14:04:26
Yea because poor people should speculate in highly volatile markets ?
Telling poor people to invest in Bitcoin because "it might take over the world"
is like telling them to invest in a Penny stock pharma company because they "might" find cure for Cancer. 
The chances of them getting poorer investing in bitcoin is way greater then getting richer.. especially after the surge of 2017.
Oh i do love myself some ignorant Crypto threads.
I know a bunch of fools buying in at 9k 10k 11k and up to 19k last year.. most of them are margin called.. luckily they are from western countries where they have social welfare and job safety.
In Zimbabwe that essentially means suicide.

Im sorry but im missing the logic in your post.

6,000 is not the worst.. post this gif again when Bitcoin reaches its 2017 lows of 700..

The technical analysis on this forum really gets me excited!  
So price will range between 5,500 and 8,000 for 2 years.. sounds about righ.

Amazon and Apple are the two greatest companies in terms of capital and growth ever in recorded history.. yet Bitcoiners see it as a given that thats the bar minimum.. also putting all the worlds money wealth is delusional beyond psychiatric help
