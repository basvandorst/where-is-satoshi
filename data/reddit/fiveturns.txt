When you start a sentence with "So this is what happened..." or "So what actually happened...", it makes it sound like everything to follow will be a fact. 
For everybody else that wants a TL;DR version of willsteel's comment:
willsteel has arrived at the conclusion that "the attacker wanted to cause troubles hoping to cause panics". He calls this Technical Insider Fraud. Technical, because the attack was technical. Fraud because it may have been used to lower prices. Insider, because the attacker was most likely indoors.

I don't think they do. I've never looked and I don't intend on doing so. It's scam-territory. It would also be very easy for the community to catch me doing this, by loading an address with small amounts to see if I steal it. I'd rather build a reputation around being trustworthy.
When I first released this, and people thought I was trying to cause a panic, there was some guy on bitcointalk's forum that looked up the home address attached to the domain registration. This happened to still be my parents address, as I'd never got around to changing it. "They have a nice house" is something you don't really want to hear. I take this as a threat, and this was over something that I thought was clearly a joke. Annoying people isn't worth the risk.

I didn't realise people would actually attempt to download all of the pages. If I realised it would have been a real issue, I would have thought about writing it in Javascript.
No, I'm not interested in the private keys of people dumb enough to search for their own. If I was, I'd make it a lot easier for them to do so.

Works great in combination with [directory.io]( Happy hunting :)

Regarding the external auditors compromising their servers: That was information that was first released regarding the attack, when I believe MtGox were still attempting to figure out what had happened.
There were reports that their user database had been leaked before the attack (on IRC, and I'm sure other places), and MtGox denied all knowledge of, or had no idea, that it had actually been leaked.
From what I remember, initially they attempted to pin the attack on a guy that managed to benefit from the price going low. There was a transcript of his dialogue on, I believe, bitcointalk's forums. He was worried about what might happen and tried to get his story out first to the community.
MtGox's story was then that an auditor, who had a copy or access to the database, had been compromised, and in turn, that information had been leaked. The leaked user information started showing up everywhere, as did stories relating to how it had been leaked. The news sites (available at that time), all relayed what MtGox had told them: an external auditor had fucked up.
However, that story changed. It came to light that the website had an SQL injection vulnerability. Transcripts of reports regarding this started to appear. MtGox dropped the "external auditor did it" story, and released [this press release](
Notice that no mention is now made of an auditor. 




I realise I haven't provided links to all the information mentioned here. I'm sure people that are interested can find these though. But even if they cannot, and everything that I think occurred happens to be a figment of my imagination: that press release is not. There's no mention of an external auditor and they decided (eventually) to take the fall for this one.
You're correct that nobody knows the whole story of MtGox, but you can remove this from the list of things that were "caused by external forces". 
The fact that nobody knows the whole story shouldn't be portrayed as a good thing and used as an excuse. They could be transparent.
When MtGox started, what they were doing was an extremely grey area. There were debates as to whether it was even legal. They were a shadowy organisation then, but just because Bitcoin has grown up since, it doesn't mean they have. MtGox was a buggy, quick to launch, almost accidental and hobby project. Don't expect them to change just because the landscape has. Maybe they shouldn't even have to change. People that demand a professional service should perhaps look elsewhere.

Yeah, you can keep your money. :)
I created a quick project on GitHub just for you: 
It's not directory.io's source, but it's one way of doing exactly the same thing but without the web interface. Enjoy.

Technically, this feature already exists :). The pluses next to the private key are permalinks which lookup a key location via a WIF private key.
For example:

You can for an obscene amount of money, if you really want to. But you shouldn't; it's worthless.

I don't think they're trying to mount a defense based upon that. It's there for comparison, because unfortunately some people are unable to read, or perhaps understand, the privacy statement.


Don't shoot them down for providing such a comparison when they know their audience needs one. 
Playing devil's advocate, I could say that you do have the ability to opt-out of this functionality. You just don't sign up.

That might take awhile to download. PM me your address, I'll post you a few blu-rays with the dump.

I'm the owner of directory.io. This isn't an attempt at a scam. The first entry isn't "fake". It is the a private key with the value of 0. The next private key is 1, after that comes 2 etc.
The original thread has not been deleted. It is right here: 
All of these keys (apart from 0) are valid. It is simply a joke. Remember when you've been told that it is almost impossible to generate a key-pair identical to somebody elses? This is a visual representation of that improbability. Look how many pages there are!
The original thread covered the fact this was a joke pretty well. No need to pretend this is a scam.
@_date: 2013-12-04 08:06:34
You people could just ask me what I'm doing. :P
I use a very small cache, 64MB. There's no need for something like Redis, because all keys are generated on the fly. See here: 
I'm also using Cloudflare, which helps with some of the caching for pages people have already been to as well. So for pages nobody has been to before, the key generation is quite slow.
It could be possible I was checking balances, but I'm not. I see that as a pointless task. This web server generates keys very slowly, despite it being accessed by a bunch of people idiotically crawling it. If I wanted to randomly check for bitcoins like this, I would just start a dedicated process, with a much faster implementation. The reason people mine for bitcoin, rather than dedicate hardware to this, is precisely because they will never find anything.
@_date: 2013-12-01 15:55:33
Not yet. I'm hoping Google will solve this problem though.
@_date: 2013-12-01 15:37:34
This is why I strategically chose an address that only appears on the last few hundred pages. Nobody will look that far.
@_date: 2013-12-01 17:47:37
That isn't "fake", it is a private key with the value of 0. So, while technically not valid, it hasn't been specifically listed there maliciously. 0 simply comes before 1 :)
@_date: 2013-12-01 18:38:16
Thank you for the tip :) I see what you mean now. That is a shame if somebody is posting messages like that.
Hopefully enough people will chime in if they see anybody becoming tricked by this. It might become more of an educational tool, rather than a joke.
@_date: 2013-12-01 23:49:24
Thank you for highlighting this.
To others: I did not create this to crash the price of bitcoin, and it didn't. 
People keep calling this fake or not real. Most people *know* how to generate every single bitcoin key-pair in existence. This doesn't make it insecure. It's secure because doing so is impossible. This is what people need to understand.
