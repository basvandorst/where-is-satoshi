There has been slow and steady inflation for a long time. I'll keep this brief: if you have a lot of cash and you want to make long term investments, buy index funds of the stock market and real estate. 
Literally no one will tell you that you should hold big chunks of your net worth in USD perpetually.

Disagree. I have a kid, a wife, comfortable six figure household income, new house new car.
I'm slowly building up to a crypto portfolio that's 2&amp; of my current portfolio. I think BTC and ETH have a good chance of outperforming the S&amp;P 500 over the next 18 months.
That's why I've invested... I'm interested in the tech, sure, but not at all interested in Italian cars.

To be clear, there will probably be an economic downtown in the next .5-1.5 years in the US. 
So what? Life goes on, people will consume basic products, companies will sell what they make, etc.
No clue why you think the currency supply--which is largely controlled by private bankers--will end up destroying the entire economy.

Not really. The truly fiat dollar \(not backed by gold\) has only existed for 4 decades.

No, I'm sorry, that's very dumb. Adopters of bitcoin want to disintermediate banks and credit card companies as places that 1. store cash 2. lend cash at interest and 3. 'facilitate' complicated \(sometimes cross\-border\) payments .
That's awesome and will be done. But that has nothing to do with the general collapse of the American economy or the stock market failing. Neither of which you want to happen if you live in the US, btw.

it's the simple Lambos that are the objects of my disdain

I'm quite interested in the technology but also fairly conservative, financially. 
There's certainly a disconnect between people who think that it will be a sort of risk haven store of value, like gold, and people who think it will be a viable currency and medium of exchange. Right now it seems like it's between those two categories.
I don't know enough to predict what BTC's ultimate fate will be.

I got in at 8,782 in May. Everything's gonna be fine.

I don't think the goal of the traders is to advance the technology\-\-they're simply betting on whether the price of BTC will go up or down.
I do think that futures trading is really important to help control price risk for volatile commodities\-\-in fact, that's what it's intended to do, and ultimately might encourage wider adoption. I'll explain: leaving speculators aside, traders of a given commodity use futures contracts to hedge their fundamental position.  In other words, you take the opposite position of what you actually want to happen.
I'll use the example from Khan Academy's video on futures contracts. If I'm an apple farmer, I might worry about what the price of apples will be six months from now when I harvest them, so I might short the price, and recover some of my money in the event of a downturn. If I buy apples wholesale and make apple pies to sell retail, I might be long the price of apples so that if my costs go up, I make some of my money back.
Similarly, imagine a world where people actually get paid their wages in BTC. An employer might worry about the relative value of BTC going up, making his payroll more expensive to cover\-\-\-so he'd be long BTC and would cover himself in the event that the amount of BTC he's already agreed to pay his workers goes up dramatically. And on the flip side, if you're an employee getting paid in bitcoin, you might worry about the price of bitcoin crashing and not being able to afford your groceries\-\-so you short bitcoin, so you make money back if the price craters.
So the point of futures contracts is to hedge against price volatility. It actually makes sense that people who are using BTC for business purposes would want to buy futures contracts. Again, I don't pretend to know the motivations of the Wall Streeters\-\-besides making money, we can assume that\-\-but futures contracts are a very basic kind of financial instrument that helps manage risk and uncertainty.

If you own a lot of BTC, you should probably short it, too.

Sorry, I didn't mean to suggest I bought a whole coin. Much less than that! I bought $500 worth. I meant 'my first amount of bitcoin' not 'my first whole bitcoin'.

I was super active on Reddit for six years, deleted my old account, lurked for a year, and then decided to make a new account to engage with this community and other blockchain and crypto stuff.

This morning I bought my first cryptocurrency and first BTC ever, at $8,782.21. I've been following crypto and blockchain news for a while but it's really exciting to finally be in it.
