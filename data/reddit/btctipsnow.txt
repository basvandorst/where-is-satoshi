I see your point but why Skype into the panel? Why the timing on this release...is it because the fact that he was there was part of the proof?

You will pay 1% on the website. If you want to use the Coinbase Exchange, you can pay either 0 or 0.25% depending on order-flow. This is a separate area of the website.

Why doesn't he just sign with his PGP key and end all of this now?
@_date: 2015-12-11 00:21:23
We still don't know who invited to the panel, and why. 
@_date: 2015-06-28 22:29:04
I see, makes sense! You are right, we are still so early, maybe I am asking the wrong question...the "Sample Size" too small -- still early days!
@_date: 2015-06-26 08:58:22
Thanks, Was it in original client or added later?
@_date: 2015-06-28 22:30:22
Wow...so true...very well said.

I want to track GBTC on my iPhone stock app (OEM one). Can't get the ticker loaded. Any ideas?
@_date: 2015-06-28 22:26:17
Wow this makes sense. So many of these smart people do understand it but maybe don't want to admit it/have too much at stake.
@_date: 2015-06-26 03:24:05
Cool idea!
@_date: 2015-06-30 20:59:58
But they process of chain right?

Just wondering if OP_RETURN opcode has been there from the start...thanks. Also I realize not intended for that, thanks!
@_date: 2015-06-28 08:30:05
Good point here...funny that most don't know about Federal Reserve etc. I think the tide is turning though. Information is more available now. I've heard regular people (not money or finance geeks) talking about how the Fed is quasi private.
@_date: 2015-12-11 03:12:23
Thanks. Do we know the why part yet?
@_date: 2015-06-28 08:32:45
This is a huge point. I think many are skeptical due to 2008 banking crisis but it is so ironic that bitcoin would be exactly what they would be interested in if they took issue with that!!!
@_date: 2015-06-28 22:24:04
Good points
@_date: 2015-06-28 08:26:44
Thanks all for the replies, great input!  This is a good point (Silly Name). I never thought about it before but now that you mentioned it I think it could have something to do with it.  
I also agree with everyone's points. My main thought was it doesn't take THAT much smarts/knowledge to understand you would think. Even really smart people dismiss it. I understand dismissing by thinking it may not work in the end. But at least praise the technology that hasn't been invented up until now which is truly remarkable.
@_date: 2015-06-29 21:40:21
How can one do this?
@_date: 2015-06-30 23:30:49
I see what you mean but in order for those investments to pay off then the currency has to appreciate. 
@_date: 2015-12-09 03:01:40
Good point.
@_date: 2015-06-30 20:36:11
How can you increase fees using breadwallet or blockchain.io?
@_date: 2015-06-27 06:13:30
Saw this regarding the issue. How can this be true if not all nodes will recognize? 
@_date: 2015-06-26 04:08:57
But it runs on top of the bitcoin protocol right?  This article seems to suggest it it doesn't. 
@_date: 2015-06-28 08:28:37
Good points, it is hard to believe what a game changer bitcoin is and most people don't even know that. They may have heard "bitcoin" but don't know what it really means.
@_date: 2015-06-28 08:35:36
I agree with this. I know the "he already did" story but now would be time time to come back, make a post and sign with private key. This is truly an important occasion where blocksize will either not be increased at all, or be increased to 20 and then many times more down the road.
@_date: 2015-06-26 03:52:00
Is Factom part of the bitcoin blockchain or is it a separate blockchain? From what I can tell it is running on the bitcoin blockchain -- which means the miners that mine bitcoin consequently mine their data.  
There seems to be confusion amongst the "bitcoin not blockchain" crowd and factom was cited as an alternative ledger in a story I read.

People just don't get it yet. I've had this issue maybe 50 times. It takes some time away from bitcoin to realize we are VERY early days. It has been said here many times but it is true. Everyone here reads this forum and news stories every day, but we are such a small group compared to population. As you said..in time!
@_date: 2015-08-01 19:34:33
Mean can we find who they are...some think it is Gov. since they attacked wikileaks.
@_date: 2015-08-04 05:12:04
Just curious how they are closing it. Are they sending you a check for the balance in your account?
@_date: 2015-07-11 22:38:48
There is a lot of miss-information out there. The only two "majors" that accept are Expedia and Overstock.

Just bought and you get a 5% discount by paying with bitcoin! Show your support to a company that accepts bitcoin and get a really cool product!
@_date: 2015-07-08 00:23:50
There was just a thread on this: 
@_date: 2015-07-11 23:42:40
Buying in bitcoin would be the ONLY value add here. Eventually it would be great to offer a discount if got merchants on board to let us buy in bulk from them.
@_date: 2015-07-11 23:45:30
You are right: both Microsoft and Dell accept for certain items. I forgot about them since they are kind of dinosaurs now ;)
@_date: 2015-07-11 23:41:43
You can buy with a credit card (USD) and email them to someone on the fly.

Hi, it's not an issue with BreadWallet -- I LOVE BreadWallet!  I was just wondering since I read that you could change the fee, but I was guessing it was from an earlier version.
@_date: 2015-07-11 22:22:12
PS: I am aware of Gyft, love the App and use it. This would be a website to buy more tech related startup app gift cards.
@_date: 2015-07-08 00:24:30
Agree with you on user base and they shouldn't be able to! I have never seen it as an option on any wallet so just wanted to see.
@_date: 2015-07-11 23:41:01
Please explain! Just trying to learn why this doesn't make sense. Also post wasn't about miner issue it was more just about the halving as far as demand increasing.
@_date: 2015-07-30 23:31:33
Sorry in advance for being uninformed, but can't we get info on the spammer(s) based on tracking which exchange the BTC was procured? I understand with local bitcoins we can't but it would be hard to get that much there.
