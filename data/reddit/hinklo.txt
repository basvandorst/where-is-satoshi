I may be wrong but I read that post as sarcasm.

I mined with 2 GPUs in 2012-2013 and was hitting around 0.1/day until the ASICs hit the market.

Wow...so much data. Thanks!

That's what I was coming here to post. I've always wondered why mtgox was called that. This definitely gives it some plausible context.

So there's a good chance that enthusiastic supporters and otherwise general attention drives short term trends, and increased utility allows for longer term bumps in value? Or at least that's a general consensus?

I've thought about this for awhile. Couldn't a large company just decide to take a capital hit buying up bitcoins and then "losing" them. If I saw something as a threat on the horizon, that's something I might do. Make an investment in accumulating the limited supply and then removing them use. Costs up front, but keeps your business model from being undermined by competition.

Paypal that will not hold your funds on a whim for indeterminate amounts of time. This has happened to me more than once.

Nice! I use foodler all the time, as do a good number of my fellow classmates (especially during exam weeks).
Edit: will try this out tomorrow.

This would be excellent. We should show him some interest.

I've actually bought things in bitcoin already, but the 3Btc I'm referencing constitutes my stash so to speak.

Was gifted a BTC in early March and then bought 2 more at just over $100 a pop. I honestly had instant buyers remorse. Not looking too shabby at 100% returns on a week old investment.

That what easy runs are for man. Active recovery!
