This is all hypothetical bc I am a law abiding citizen, and thus have surely never used any kind of black market in any form (forms include, but are not limited to, ●1. physical ie in person transactions wherein illicit goods are being sold/exchanged from one person to another and/or taxes are no paid on the goods &amp;/or services renedering an otherwise legal exchange a criminal act of financial assult on the government ●2. Digital exactly the same as the first form but done on a computer and in situations involving goods they are delivered by alternative means to in person when nessicary ie via the postal system ●3. Imaginary that's right folks according to this disclaimer even in my dreams if i go to buy a coke labeled .99 i will be paying 1.07 at the register bc as a law abiding citizen i know that it is a gift to be able to pay more for an item than is indicated bc i who wouldnt want to pay their government everytime they buy something just for allowing them to buy it). END OF DISCLAIMER!
I know I'd be all edgy if I had $20 sitting in some dnm bc I have lived long enough to see what happens when these markets get busted........ With that said I feel like I have to ask are you like 6 years old when you sold on alphabay, or did you just legit think "They got silk road but they won't ever catch alphabay! See here's how much faith i have in it im gonna keep so much money on there if they get busted ill be homeless in less than a week!"???????????????????
