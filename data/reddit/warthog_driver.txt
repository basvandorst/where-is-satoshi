You might want to talk to the person who owns that ATM. When I talked to the robocoin guys at a trade show in vegas they told me that the markup is set by the kiosk owner, not them. I heard that there is one robocoin where the owner has set 18% on it. 
"Hemp &amp; Co" ? I doubt many people are in there buying bitcoin. " Can I have 10 ft of .. em er "hemp" ...and some rolling papers... oh and some gummi bears .. and two bags of chips .... " Oh wait... this is Victoria. I'm still recovering from vegas. Sorry.

Anyone who has actually seen a Robocoin ATM in action ( or broken, or being worked on, or being set up ) knows that it does not run on XP. Y'all just believed this guy who claims it runs on XP with no proof in the middle of a Robocoin bashing thread. You know how it goes, guy has one legitimate complaint, but he has to invent other things to make it look really horrible and to make people get on his bandwagon. Baaaa Baaaaa..

Her'es the problem : Who is the arbitrator of truth and honesty? One person comes in to reddit and tells a one sided story , incites people to grab their pitchforks and torches without hearing both sides of the story and making assumptions and flinging insults. 7badgers is absolutey right - get law enforcement involved. Anyone can post ' true ' things on reddit, but in the court of law both sides get heard and judgement is based on the law(s) and not mob rule. Until the community does that nothing is really going to change.

Yep. Normally the robocoins run on ethernet only. They had to mod it to get it to work with wifi, and then the wifi was unstable. I saw them at another trade show in Vegas and the wifi there had a honeypot and a reflector attack going on against it. At least three of the people there had cornered a hotel tech and were giving him hell. It made for a funny story on the flight home.

Have you ever read their page? The operators who buy the kiosks set the markup, not robocoin. You know spending 10 min with a robocoin tech at a trade show I learned enough to disprove a lot of the tech spew here. The business problems .. well.. yeah. Stupid is as stupid does but the amount of tech misinformation here is staggering.
