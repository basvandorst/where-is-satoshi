Yes, he is one of many. Dorian is currently inside the AP's LA bureau being interviewed. Reporters are waiting outside the building.

I hope the AP eventually publishes the entire interview.

Now comes the BitRapture.

I did, I'm guessing you didn't read the original version of the article. The first version they quick published didn't contain that information. They updated it with more details later.

Unfortunately, he never got that free lunch due to the media swarming the restaurant. Thus proving there's no such thing as a free lunch.

Are you serious? I would have million questions for him. To start, I would ask him if he did say these quotes:


I would ask him what he meant by that.

True, but the guy tweeting is a verified LA Times reporter. 
@_date: 2014-03-07 00:41:23
There will be more details later I'm sure. They published this &lt; 30 mins after he left the building.

Yeah, it couldn't be that hard to call the Temple City Sheriff's department and confirm the quotes. If I was a reporter, I would be all over that.
@_date: 2014-03-07 01:21:49
Yes, that could be. The AP reporter probably went through every part of Newsweek story with him. Dorian's responses to this are the further details I'm looking for.

Seriously? You want people to just buy you a dog?

He deleted the original post mentioning SR on bitcointalk. But, somebody quoted it in same thread. Here's screenshot of the two posts that revealed his email:

Good luck with that bro.

I'm not sure what the point is, even if they make the subreddit private and delete all the posts, everything will still be in Reddit's database which they can easily look at with a subpoena.
