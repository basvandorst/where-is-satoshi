If you're implying im Jason, thats laughable.  He's twice the man I am. I understand why you would be skeptical of his work and success.  Its my understanding the entire  charity is trying to be as transparent as possible.  Last I heard they were working on a system to track every donation to exactly what it was used for.  Again I get why you question, but he is a man trying to make a difference in a world where few people are. Make snide comments all you want, ill start listening when you've provided 70,000 meals to the homeless.

Just to enlighten you, Jason King the one who you think is rewarding himself...Has twice his personal money in Seans Outpost and Satoshi Forest than has been donated. Its costing him personally to do any of this. Please check your facts before assuming everyone is corrupt.

Had the pleasure of hanging with these guys personally.  You will be hard pressed to find a more transparent, driven and hopeful charity.  The city fights them at every turn and they still accomplish their goals.  All the while Jason King is running across the US to raise awareness. I've heard him say more than once he's going to end homelessness, not just help.  If you are looking for a charity to donate money or time, I can not recommend them enough.

Ok....so i was with jason several times on his trip across the US. First in Dallas, then Tucson and finally almost all of California. I am best friends with a guy who was with him from Dallas to to San Francisco. He drove the RV. I personally witnessed Jason wake up at 6am everyday and run at least 25 miles but often way more. He lost like 150lbs or something. He was dropped off by my friend and I where he ended the day before. I saw this happen at least 20 times. I obviously am not claiming to know the time i was not there, but most people can't just run 25 miles a day to keep a scam up when people are looking. Everyone is human, humans are imperfect, and  hes never claimed to be anything more. I'm not going to debate things i don't know about the finances of seans outpost, however i just couldn't let this comment go. I personally saw jason running across the country.....so yes i believe he actually did it. Im going to dinner, you need proof ill post pics of those times and also driving the rv from San Francisco to DC for the bitcoin on the beltway conference.
