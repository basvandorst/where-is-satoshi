You are using reason in a market that is ruled by utter chaos half the time...and panic that turns to FOMO. An utterly irrational market does what it does best...reacts irrationally. If you get used to it you can trade around it. Otherwise just sit tight...and HOLD if you think there is a chance and getting ETF approval is bullish for BTC.

The less you have the futures markets involved, the better. Back when the CBOE and the CME got involved with their futures the investment houses that were in at that time were all saying they would short BTC to submission as it was massively overvalued and the head of the CBOE said they would "tame" BTC back down to a more reasonable price area. Not ringing approval...and they have been shorting ever since and shorting big right now. It may help it appear "legit" but it does not help the tech and makes it appear like it is an asset that cannot find its footing. What we need is fiat pairs for the Alts to let them rise or fall on their own and tech advancement and custody accounts. That would help BTC the most.

I wish that were true...unfortunately, until these alt coins get some other kind of fiat pairings BTC is going to have massive volume and a price that is well above its utility to the Wall Street boys. Which will always makes the Futures an attractive market for them, along with the ETF...hopefully you are correct that enough custodian acccounts and fiat pairs will be in this market IN GENERAL that it will not force the need for ETFs into the future....but they will always short or long if they can.

Binance was worse than HitBTC according to the article...

It is both, and also LTC. Read the article...just one of the worse cases he found was with BCH.
