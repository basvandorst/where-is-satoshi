What's your reasoning?  Not saying your wrong just want to understand your line of thought.     Most of the truly scammy .coms were torched by this time on that graph, down way more than 50%.  Also 9/11 was a major catalyst for the next dip.  Then there was a war.  So not exactly apples to apples here.

More like they are fading retail still. Too bad a 3x bear etf never launched for the rest of us.

I was on the boards back then, they were actually still pretty useful at that time IMO. I learned my lesson from then, def took a hit. 
Its definitely interesting how there is zero sense of panic here on reddit and this shit has dropped 60% already. And we are talking real money now, not when it was worth significantly less. People are getting destroyed in this drop but not a peep.
The sentiment reminds me of what I saw during the housing crash. I was flipping land in Florida.  Within a year of the peak which was actually in 2005, prices dropped a good 50% but there wasn’t any panic.  By the following year lots were down a good 80% and people started to wake up a bit. Of course then you had the national crash and there was full blown panic, prices bottomed out around 90% lower and still have not recovered. 
Is this the path BTC will take?  Tune in.  Its definitely an issue for cryptos that the stock market is getting volatile again and risk is back on, the easy money has been made there.  People are not going to speculate in cryptos as much if the equity markets are no longer going up in a straight line.  In fact expect the opposite response.
