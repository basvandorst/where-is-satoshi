Why would anyone take advice from this? Connor McGregor has never boxed before? Are you kidding me? He boxes peoples face off. He isnt some BJJ world class grappler. He hits people, and he hits people hard and fast. He may have never had a professional boxing match against a top 5 boxer of all time, but saying he has never boxed before is foolish beyond belief. 
@_date: 2017-08-26 23:07:57
Agreed.

Split it in half. Use first half during your gut instinct, use second half at the time ot your possibly shitty attempt at timing a market in these stages of growth

Can you go a little further in depth please? I think this will be the method i use, but what determines a "safe" computer? One that has never been connected to the internet? 
How do you access an electrum wallet. 
What keeps a seed safe, and what can take away the safety of a key?
Thanks for the help. Im adapting as fast as i can but im still new.

He will probably lose. But to completely discredit him as a striker and a combat athlete? Shut the hell up hahah

Knowing how to spell correctly will get you into a shocking amount of colleges. 
While explaining, make sure to dumb it down as much as you possibly can. Even some high profile businessmen dont get it. Its an "internet thing".

Only time you should be checking is when you want more bitcoin.

Same amount of coins. Double the value. ;)

Peter Schiff recommends an online site/app to
1.) Buy gold
2.) Own the rights to the gold in another country, but never have it shipped to you
3.) Trade these IOUs to friends and family for no fee. 
Hes forgetting the safety risks of an IOU? Really? And we expect him to understand crypto? He is the guy to buy 100 BTC and keep it on coinbase. The dude doesnt understand the necessity of having and holding your own coins, becoming his own bank. He likes the idea of a centralized commodity, not decentralized?

Im making a video series for my friends and family on Facebook. I keep trying to get them involved, but they are asking questions so fast that I cant get back to them fast enough. 
This is the absolute first video. Can you share your thoughts on what i did right/wrong to help point them in the correct direction from here on out? 
@_date: 2017-08-27 05:07:17
Going into computer science, however, and you're in. Do your research(if you haven't) and express the full idea. Youll be good my man.

You didnt yell at your newborn child telling them to start mowing the lawn and taking out the trash, did you?
Give it some time.

Considering it was at 4500 within the last 5 days, i would say a 600 buck value swing would justify at least a little bit of a dip. 
You spell it barely. ;)
