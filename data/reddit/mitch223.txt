The main thing I'd hope your company starts is cash deposits for more instant transfers. Thats one of the things that took me away from your site.

I like all that, but the 10% GST fee :\ Coinjar is one of the few markets charging it, and it brings the price up considerably.
I was going to buy $1000 worth of bitcoins through Coinjar today until I saw their fee, then found these other possible markets. Thought I would get user feedback before I jump in on one.

Oh I do, I don't blame Coinjar at all. It just sucks they are one of the first to apply the GST, where as iGot (if it's legit) hasn't yet, nor has Local Bitcoins or BTCMarkets.
Yeah, I'm more of an offline wallet fan, but more ATMs would be good. I believe there are a few in Melbourne and Sydney mainly?

Really BTCMarkets is that bad?
Yeah not a fan of iGot. Had one transaction with them and had huge delays.
Only thing I don't like about IndepedentReserve is the lack of instant/same day cash deposits...

Alright so I know it's late but as of today igot confirmed I'm getting my money back and I got the usual text that my withdrawal has been processed. Will see in a few days if it shows up in my bank account.
Would like to add I requested the withdrawal midway through July, and made numerous support tickets and sent emails, mostly without reply, until I launched an ACORN report, and contacted the financial ombudsman and informed iGot of this.
Within a few days of informing igot I had done this I recieved a lenghty reply to one of my support tickets then another reply and now confirmation of withdrawal.
Anyone who wants to check my username can confirm I'm not some iGot faggot who just made an account and I'm just posting to let people know you may get your money back. I'll update on this once the money arrives in my bank account (was only a few thousand so not too significant compared to some people I imagine)

Just thought I'd let everyone know the money arrived in my account today, although the company name that deposited it is PRIME FOCUS AUST
So anyone thats having trouble, start a report with ACORN, and a financial ombudsman, maybe even a fair trades agency, tell iGot what you've done then you'll get your money back quickly.
