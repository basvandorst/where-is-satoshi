Not exactly. It depends on your reasoning for hodling. If you're hodling because you're a geek who has read everything there is to know about Bitcoin and you are confident that the technology is so great  that the price is bound to increase long-term, than you are not gambling, you are speculating. If you are an exxperienced trader working from a trading strategy that is suggesting you do what amounts to hodling, then you are not gambling, you are speculating. If you are hodling and have no reasoning for why you are doing so other than the price increasing, then you are gambling.

This. There is inherent utility in money. Money itself is useful. "Intrinsic value"/non-monetary utility is just a trick/gimmick to create trust in the money's function as a store of value. The network effect is the far more powerful factor. Once you bootstrap a network, as long as the money has good functionality as money, it's value is almost entirely determined by the network effect. At that point, people won't stop valuing the money because it loses or never had non-monetary value, they'll stop valuing it if it loses its functionality as money, which is generally because it is no longer seen as a store of value (devaluation/inflation) or if the network is fragmented (natural disasters, wars, imperial decline, etc).

No, because bcash's scaling solution consists of periodic hard-forks to increase the blocksize. These hard-forks are a social engineering vulnerability. While the Core roadmap may include hard-forks, the aim seems to be to avoid them as much as possible. So Core will try to avoid hard-forks and keep the cost of running full nodes down.
For most here, Core's proposed trade-offs are preferable. Both directions will lead to some degree of centralization.

Those are pretty great use-cases though. I mean, ransome-ware can fuck off of course, but still.
I think Bitcoin will be a settlement layer between payment services like Paypal, Applepay, etc. and will feature heavily in the so-called "internet of things". It has a convincing use-case for that sort of role. Basically, a peer to peer electronic cash system for a world that will be increasingly electronic, but also susceptible to the attacks that bitcoin is not particularly vulnerable too.

Savings can be understood as a potential investment in some future enterprise or consumption of a future good. So people do not and would not save indefinitely or for no reason, they are saving for when a suitable opportunity in line with their time preferences presents itself.
One thing your contingency ignores is self-employment. In a scenario where savings is extreme (and improbable), households may become more autarkic, meaning self-sufficient. This would reduce the division of labor and the efficiencies normally gained from it, but perhaps it may in certain situations (such as a widespread decrease in social trust) be rational. That is a minor point though, just to illustrate that an extreme level of savings could be rational.
Normally, the general level of savings would not be so extreme. Eventually, the increase in savings would cause entrepreneurs to accept very high interest rates on loans, above the rate of appreciation of the money unit. So, savers would make more money by investing than by saving. We can assume the level of savings would then equilibrate.
What would probably happen (under normal circumstances) in an economy with a deflationary currency is that time preferences would be reduced, which in a simplistic sense, means that people would be less wasteful, more prudent and patient, which would raise productivity. Additionally, long-term growth in productivity would be raised due to reduction in the severity of business cycles; the artificial severity that is caused by inflationary monetary policy.

Men and women are different. Men should perform roles suitable for men and women for women.
The wealthier a country the more the disparity in gender roles grows. This is because men and women have natural inclinations that differ, and a higher standard of living allows them to choose roles that suit their innate tendencies.


More and more research is confirming this. Social constructionism is a dangerous lie.
Like most things, specialization and increasing wealth are correlated.
@_date: 2017-08-15 18:19:59
Inflation is a tax on patience. It biases present investment and consumption opportunities over future ones. You can think of savings as an investment in an economy that does not exist today but may in the future. It is a bet against the current array of opportunities which can help one avoid systemic risk.
If you think society is going the wrong direction, you can both avoid the pitfalls of that trajectory and help shift it by betting against the economy through saving instead of investing or consuming. It is basically a meta investment.

The problem with blocksize hardforks is that they need to be done periodically, introducing the dangerous precedent of regular hardforks.
I lose no sleep over people selling their bcash for consumer trinkets. What I worry about is the massive amount of FUD and astroturfing. And the attacks on the Bitcoin network by miners concentrated in China.
Cheap fees? That's a spec of dust compared to the concentration of mining power. The lesson for me out of all of this is we need more miners in more parts of the world. And if they attack Bitcoin again in 2 days, I'll take a haircut in exchange for an emergency hardfork to change the POW algorithm.

I'm not. I am accumulating BTC not spending it on bullshit. Scaling will happen (although miners have delayed for months and months). Schnorr signatures on the way soon :)
Increasing block size is a non-solution that will risk the robustness of the network in its infancy. Bitcoin needs to be secure before it is efficient. I don't give a shit if you can't tip people on forums, gamble on satoshiDice, or buy coffee at hipster cafes. Making sure that nodes are trivial to set-up and run and can operate via satellite and radio is far more important at this stage. Bitcoin needs to be like the AK 47: resilient and everywhere.
There are many people working on scaling. If segwit wasn't stalled for so long, we would be farther along already.

I think moving forward, people need to recognize that Bitcoin is a technology. Improvements are made by engineers and the choices are complicated. You can have a difference of opinion as a layman based on intutions, but when the intellectual majority keeps telling you that a design choice has problems, one needs to take pause. 
Additionally, there is the issue of conspiracy theories (on both sides). This issue is a harder problem to solve because I guarantee that there are and will be factions in this world who want to disrupt Bitcoin. They may be corporations, governments, altcoiners, hackers, criminal organizations, etc. So the theories have at least a nugget of plausibility. Nevertheless, they create a toxic environment which is exploited by bad-faith participants in our community. And the natural inclination in this unstructured environment is civil war between useful idiots orchestrated by manipulators.

I can spend Bitcoin fine now, and I do plan to spend in time. You speak as if transactions have ground to a halt. They haven't. They are just a bit more expensive.
Secondly, value is partially determined by speculation which considers future developments/pitfalls. I speculate that Bitcoin will solve the scaling problem in one way or another. I have *zero* problems with not using Bitcoin as a day to day currency until that point. Bitcoin doesn't need to sell itself to impatient hipster pooftahs.

Because both the network costs and transaction fees can remain low via small(er) blocks with second layer applications. If our prospective third-worlder wishes to use Bitcoin, they can have a chance at running a full node (at the very least some small businesses will be able to, which is something), they can do daily transactions with 2nd layer apps, and they can make large important purchases with the main chain and store their savings there.

Too many people were sold on the idea of "cheap fees" a couple years ago. Frankly, I blame this community. Many were trying to sell bitcoin to skeptics and the disinterested and at the time, the idea of "cheap fees" was a go-to claim to win internet arguments.
So we've ended up with a non-negligible portion of the community who think that "cheap fees" is THE selling point of Bitcoin. In reality, the "cheapness" is relative *to the security you are purchasing by using a blockchain instead of a trusted third party*. If Bitcoin fees are X and Trusted^tm payment processor's fees are &lt;X, the question should be, "what security are these fees buying you?" Does the security outweigh the cost of the fees? Then use Bitcoin's blockchain. Do they not? Then you don't need to use the Bitcoin blockchain. That's not to say that lower fees are irrelevant, they are preferable, but they are not the be-all end-all they have been made out to be!

My point is that people aren't just unloading their bitcoin. They are trading up. Bitcoin has been around for about a decade and the price has been on a bumpy uptrend. Obviously, even people like myself who bought some relatively early are still trying to buy more.
You're fake quote makes it sound like early adopters are just unloading trying to escape Bitcoin. In reality, this seems to be the choice for only a minority. And they are just as likely to continue to buy or trade after any profit-taking.
And it's also bullshit that people like myself would just unload at some arbitrary number of coins. I 'd sell a portion at 10k (for example), but the vast majority I would retain and so on.

The implication was that we are anxious to sell. That is observably not the case. Most say that they will sell some in the future at a higher price, but not necessarily for fiat, instead in exchange for goods and services. And they will not dump at some arbitrary price, but sell over time.
Further, the implication was that Bitcoin has no value and its only value is in handing it off at a higher price. This is also not the case. Bitcoin is a peer to peer digital cash system. A given amount of btc has value because it is a unit embedded within a system that is in many ways a superior money system. Not in all ways, but in some, and that's enough for people to speculate that they value these units. Money is not useful in and of itself. It's the context that gives money value, the amount that you trust one money network over another. Fiat has value because you trust the network maintained by state x or y. Precious metals have value because they have some uses outside of money, they are durable, fungible, and have a long history. Thus the network of precious metal markets gives gold, silver, etc, value beyond their non-money uses. They are also money units and are valued additionally in that regard.
People trust the Bitcoin network because of various reasons and therefore the units of money have value because they are embedded in that network. Just like worthless dollar bills have value because they are embedded in the USG network.
The core problem is that many see money atomically, each unit having intrinsic value. In fact, money is a network and the units are stand ins for debts owed within the network.

What's the chance that this wasn't a hack but was a test by Showtime? These people would be familiar with the PirateBay as they are natural enemies, which is where they may have gotten the idea from.

Yes, because that economy is a fiat regime that depends on inflation for economic growth. International trade complicates this. See the first couple sentences of my post.

The blockchain will be centralized with larger blocks. It is better that the main chain remains decentralized and that we find a way to make nodes profitable via off-chain scaling.

Reposting these two comments I made in other threads:
"Inflation is a tax on patience. It biases present investment and consumption opportunities over future ones. You can think of savings as an investment in an economy that does not exist today but may in the future. It is a bet against the current array of opportunities which can help one avoid systemic risk.
If you think society is going the wrong direction, you can both avoid the pitfalls of that trajectory and help shift it by betting against the economy through saving instead of investing or consuming. It is basically a meta investment."
"Savings can be understood as a potential investment in some future enterprise or consumption of a future good. So people do not and would not save indefinitely or for no reason, they are saving for when a suitable opportunity in line with their time preferences presents itself.
One thing your contingency ignores is self-employment. In a scenario where savings is extreme (and improbable), households may become more autarkic, meaning self-sufficient. This would reduce the division of labor and the efficiencies normally gained from it, but perhaps it may in certain situations (such as a widespread decrease in social trust) be rational. That is a minor point though, just to illustrate that an extreme level of savings could be rational.
Normally, the general level of savings would not be so extreme. Eventually, the increase in savings would cause entrepreneurs to accept very high interest rates on loans, above the rate of appreciation of the money unit. So, savers would make more money by investing than by saving. We can assume the level of savings would then equilibrate.
What would probably happen (under normal circumstances) in an economy with a deflationary currency is that time preferences would be reduced, which in a simplistic sense, means that people would be less wasteful, more prudent and patient, which would raise productivity. Additionally, long-term growth in productivity would be raised due to reduction in the severity of business cycles; the artificial severity that is caused by inflationary monetary policy."

The deflationary death spiral is moronic and I'll need to see some sources on that claim. Please show me examples of a death spiral in an economy that doesn't already depend on inflation for reducing government debt. Obviously, deflation is not good for a country that uses inflation as life support. Show me examples of a regime with a limited money supply that went through a deflationary death spiral. So Japan is already out of the question.
