There are many scammers that once identified charge a very small amount and then wait until circle lifts the limits. I don't think many people would notice a 1 dollar charge on their bank account. They then follow on to buy a bigger chunk of bitcoin and run away with them.

Not sure if I have any money on changetip. Here's 10 cents @_date: 2015-05-18 18:51:37
It isn't, but how else would you send money or receive. ;)
@_date: 2015-05-05 21:22:26
Ah, but there some that say even 10mb is a lot. I assumed you meant have it changed to 5, and then we'd need to pull off another hard fork for it to increase to 10mb. That's a years worth for two changes. I'm not so sure an automatic yearly increase would sit well for some developers. 
@_date: 2015-05-10 01:25:17
I'd recommend it. That or bitpay!
@_date: 2015-05-10 20:29:38
I think we'd need to bug apple to be able to have this kind of verification.
@_date: 2015-05-28 15:15:56
Mullvad? Discount with bitcoin is pretty cool
@_date: 2015-05-05 19:11:01
I doubt it. If you intentionally put forth transactions that will not confirm because they have zero fees I'd assume the payment processors would apply the fee themselves using this to make sure they have a chance of confirming? 
@_date: 2015-05-05 21:26:18
This is why you want to have a decentralized currency like bitcoin. 
"Pursuant to the agreement, Ripple Labs will also undertake certain enhancements to the Ripple Protocol to appropriately monitor all future transactions." 
Fuck that.
@_date: 2015-05-10 18:59:22
Yeah, it's closed source. Bread is open.
@_date: 2015-05-12 19:43:36
Then we don't have to worry about NASDAQ clogging up the chain. They'd use the current implementation of colored coins to test the network out, and shift over to LN style network once it's feasible too.
@_date: 2015-05-24 07:17:55
I hate to by that guy but it's on torrent sites right now. You could changetip him the whole price and download the epub or whatever other format it is in and convert it to pdf.

Adam Traidman, Co-Founder/CEO, breadwallet. 
@_date: 2015-05-05 19:36:28
With this pull yes. Child-pays-for-parent / Add transaction fee later : 
@_date: 2015-05-14 23:40:50
That's different. It's not removing money from older addresses and you can spot when someone creates an indefinite number of bitcoins which was fixed.
@_date: 2015-05-30 00:14:41
All of my 4 transactions from circle got confirmed the first block. .0001 fee.  The one I sent from breadwallet with a 31 bit fee has yet to confirm.
@_date: 2015-05-13 15:17:19


First link I get is a ponzi scheme alert. ha 
@_date: 2015-05-10 20:58:20
I think that's done on purpose. 
@_date: 2015-05-30 00:18:24
Two breadwallet txs have yet to confirm. Tx's from circle confirmed right away. I'll update how many blocks it takes to confirm.
@_date: 2015-05-09 03:37:43
I'm hoping this happens. 
1. 1+ long term holders of bitcoin sell their shares for a premium on GBTC
2. Re-buy at a cheaper price.
@_date: 2015-05-10 23:54:14
Like Ƀ?
@_date: 2015-05-10 20:05:10
Their entropy can be flawed in some way that we don't know about. We wouldn't know since it's closed source. There could be other bugs that can be exploited that we wouldn't know about. I wouldn't exactly  say don't trust them. I mean I trust Mycelium and think they're a good spending wallet, but I'd lean more on trusting open source wallets with my money.
@_date: 2015-05-05 19:32:58
It's very hard to change. You can't just increase it to 5 and change it to 10 when it's needed. 20 gives a bit of headroom. There won't be 20mb blocks right off the block.
@_date: 2015-05-24 18:18:24
Yes. Hard copies are so much better!.
@_date: 2015-05-17 20:35:33
Doesn't coinbase do this too? I sent in money, and saw it being split up and get into a transaction chain.. 
@_date: 2015-05-12 19:15:59
I sure has heck hope they do. If they fail, it'll be embarrassing and set back future exchanges/companies VC from being interested in bitcoin/blockchain tech.
@_date: 2015-05-10 18:59:49
How? It's simple and to the point. 
@_date: 2015-01-26 21:31:55
Which is why I had such a hard time being verified on coinbase in the beginning of 2014. (Never had credit, until recently)
@_date: 2015-05-11 01:10:01
It isn't all open source? (from what I heard)  I knew beforehand that some of it was. Correct me if I'm wrong.
@_date: 2015-05-06 20:36:16
Not with 1MB blocks it won't.
@_date: 2015-05-10 20:27:21
It's the symbol for bits
@_date: 2015-05-12 18:25:26
"Coinbase may allow people to use virtual currency, but the company is good at raising actual money" What a low blow.
@_date: 2015-05-18 18:55:31
It may only mine when you're connected to power and the Internet.
@_date: 2015-05-18 19:05:40
Perhaps the framework for a wallet is more suitable term.
@_date: 2015-05-08 07:30:47
Aw, I haven't gotten this. I've been around since they were only doing invite only registration and haven't had my instant limit raised. Then again, I haven't been buying as much as I used to.
@_date: 2015-05-10 18:58:40
It's good, but this is better for newbies.
@_date: 2015-05-08 06:36:45
I look at it like this. Long term holders that hold some bitcoin through Barry can sell on GBTC and rebuy them at the lower price we currently have outside of GBTC. At least until the price of GBTC settles down closer to the outside markets.
@_date: 2015-05-13 15:45:07
Wasn't the main guy just arrested?
@_date: 2015-07-22 17:29:27
Blockchain.info is a horrible wallet. Give them a better one like breadwallet or airbitz. Do not talk about private keys, most people won't give a shit or won't understand it. Basically get down to the basics of how to buy and send to a local wallet and backing them up so they don't lose their money. Don't go into details unless they ask, you'll most likely confuse them.
@_date: 2015-07-21 18:05:32
I believe there will be an update to bread soon that will fix that.
@_date: 2015-07-01 20:56:05
I want to believe but your account is new. :(
@_date: 2015-07-27 19:20:24
I thought Android was more secure? It's not when the carriers don't push updates... :) iOS isn't perfect either, but this is a joke.
@_date: 2015-04-23 22:11:25
Lamassu was great hardware wise I still think they have the best BTM. This sucks, though.
@_date: 2015-04-30 20:23:30
Try out mullvad, I recommend it. 
@_date: 2015-11-02 22:16:43
Wait how long are blocktimes in alpha currently? Or is that tweaked for liquid.
@_date: 2015-11-03 00:29:08
Can you say if it's on the bitcoin blockchain?
@_date: 2015-03-05 21:02:35
"SecondMarket’s trading division participated in today’s auction and bid for every block, according to Managing Director Brendan O’Connor. Draper said he didn’t participate in the bidding." Draper said he did in the Reuters piece?
@_date: 2015-03-05 20:31:10
Need confirmation. New account? :(
@_date: 2015-03-05 20:57:40
The only thing I'm worried about is if tellers will mind the risk of bitcoin volatility after the initial three days. I sure wouldn't want to sell if I'm down a few percent.
@_date: 2015-02-10 23:52:03
Bitcoin can't scale at 1mb... Even with off-chain transactions.....
