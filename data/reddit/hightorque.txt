This is awesome - something all exchanges should be doing. In fact, I'd go further and say that in accordance with the practices of the traditional finance world, you should actually be *paying* large volume traders providing liquidity. It's such a common practice there because it lets exchanges steal liquidity from other exchanges and as a result provides a better product to the liquidity takers and sets you up to be a leader in the space. So surprised the Bitcoin world hasn't caught on to this yet.

Option A:




Option B:




Which would you choose?
(revenues are equal here, assuming a snapshot in time)
Make sure to consider that you get more fees with higher volume and every exchange is fiercely battling to steal volume from the others. Each player decides to go to a given exchange because of the volume they have. Thus incentivizing those who can provide liquidity and charging more to those who take it is a very good play. Experts figured this out, not me. You make *more* money this way.

Just checked your profile data: 
The url you use has to be a url of an image (e.g. ending in .png or .jpg), rather than a url to a page that contains the image.
We realize this is confusing, so we're working on adding an option to upload an image.

Great idea! We'll add support for that on the onename.io profile explorer.  The protocol is flexible, though, so you can add any profile/account to your OneName profile data - it's just a question of whether one of the big profile explorers supports it and will pick it up and display it.
@_date: 2014-08-18 01:43:10
We completely agree :)
As it turns out, we're only storing identity in the blockchain and then simply URI refereences to additional data stored elsewhere. The graph file that lists the users is actually stored at a location of the user's choosing - users can even host it themselves. But the very fact that they can change the pointer at any time means that they have ultimate control over who they are saying that they know/trust/are interested in.
@_date: 2014-03-12 18:37:01
This is an open platform, so we'd be happy to have developers join the community and build their own apps on OneName! If you know any windows phone developers, hit them up and show them the protocol specifications!
@_date: 2014-03-31 14:09:29
Yes, phishing is indeed something to think about.
However, any security concerns you may have can be addressed by two things:
1) pull the data from multiple profile explorers
2) pull the verification links from users that have verified their identities and prompt the user to make sure it's the right person (just in case they typed in the username wrong)
I feel like  is quite important whereas  is nice but not necessary (a bit too much hand-holding, even). Users copy-pasting Bitcoin addresses correctly will be able to copy/remember usernames correctly.
@_date: 2014-03-12 18:28:45
Thanks, glad you like it! We really appreciate the support!
@_date: 2014-03-12 19:10:10
Yes, the former is correct.
Thanks! We're working hard on it and appreciate any help and/or feedback.
We *love* pull requests to the protocol spec repo ( and we *love* developers who build on OneName. Plenty of cool stuff to be done.

@_date: 2014-03-12 19:08:25
Sources of verification: Twitter, Github, pointers from domains, etc. Your accounts on each of these sites constitute a part of your online identity. Taken together, multiple verified sources give others a sense of your probabilistically verified identity. Yes, each individual source uses centralized verification, but because you can choose which sources to rely on, YOU are in complete control of your verification. :D
@_date: 2014-06-17 03:09:41
OK, I agree, it's not right of them to decide to not be involved in the discussions.
However, let's step back a bit. Is GHash.io really the problem? Why are we deciding to rely on these pools to self-regulate? How does that make any sense? Shouldn't this be a secure, trust-less, decentralized currency?
IMO our number 1 priority right now should be to figure out a way to fix the incentives in the Bitcoin protocol. Miners should be incentivized to mine on their own and they should be dis-incentivized to join pools.
There are a few main ways to do this:
1. give the miners some trump card over the mining pools
2. ensure that small miners have the same mining reward variability as large miners (pools)
Andrew Miller has proposed an interesting solution that falls into the first category (
And Peter Todd has proposed a solution that falls into the second category (
Yes, I know there's a lot more to be fleshed out here and some of these solutions (especially Peter's) are pretty big changes to the protocol, but all I'm saying is that there's something here and we should be looking harder and focusing our energy on finding an incentive-compatible solution rather than trying to appeal to our miner overlords to cooperate and at least pretend to play nice.

With our profile builder, we do not include addresses in the profile data, as that could lead to spam. It's only for our site and to get in contact with you. That said, if you can always edit your profile JSON and add your email address, if you so wish.

Hi there, which info are you not comfortable with giving up? We're trying to minimize the info that we require and at the same time give you the best experience possible. We give you the option to complete your profile with twitter simply for the convenience, but you can skip it, for example.
@_date: 2014-07-17 22:36:23
Maybe, but maybe not.
Consider that today, the vast majority of wallets are out of range for the mainstream consumer.
The largest players like Coinbase, Bitpay and Circle will be the only ones who can both navigate all of the regulation AND provide an experience that's acceptable and attractive to the mainstream consumer.
It's quite possible that this results in significant consolidation.
@_date: 2014-03-10 12:49:14
Take the sha256 of the passphrase you wrote down. That will give you your private key in hex form.
@_date: 2014-06-14 00:33:22
Yes absolutely, but I think it's pretty clear this isn't an instance of what you're referring to.
@_date: 2014-03-10 17:48:26
Yes, very good point. We want to add an option for people to put in a "destination" namecoin address.
If you really don't want to trust us AT ALL, you can always register for a username manually. Just use the profile builder and grab the JSON, then register a name on Namecoin-Qt.
We just realized that the typical user would not be savvy enough to do this. As a result, we provided multiple methods to register and made some compromises.

What do you think of Keyhotee? In what ways do you think it's better or worse than OneName?
@_date: 2014-06-14 01:26:16
Thanks bro. It's true, they seriously don't. It seems like the core devs are way more critical of and concerned about bitcoin than the typical redditor or typical investor. Mike Hearn has been extremely critical lately, Peter Todd is now quite concerned, and Gavin is saying "Bitcoin is still a work in progress, and you should only risk time or money on it that you can afford to lose" (which is true but still wasn't the reaction I was hoping for/expecting). This whole mess we're in with hyper-consolidated mining power is way more serious than people realize. What seems crazy to me is many people are calling for miners to leave GHash and go to P2Pool, but then once people point out the variance problem and how P2Pool is at least 0.4% less efficient than larger pools, they say "oh wait, no I meant you should join a pool with 10-20% hash power". Is that the point that we've gotten to? One in which we need to have between 1 and 5 individuals that need to be coerced in order for an entire economy to be compromised?

Here's a bigger version: 
@_date: 2014-03-12 18:37:43
Can you give me an example? Keep in mind all names registered on OneName use the u/ namespace in Namecoin.
@_date: 2014-01-02 18:18:45
Yes, I made a typo and I copied it over.
@_date: 2014-07-09 13:49:50
The name would have to both look similar / enable typos AND have the same pin. For a given name, are there 16 bits worth of typos?
@_date: 2014-03-08 22:17:55
This is completely wrong and VERY dangerous.
Private keys are 256 bits but require 2^128 operations to crack. If you store 2/3 of a private key in one location (as shown above), then discovery of that piece of information will be more than enough to crack it (less than 2^43 operations is extremely doable).
I know of two ACTUALLY SECURE methods for storing access to your funds in multiple locations:
1) split your private key using a cryptographically secure secret sharing scheme, such as [Shamir's Secret Sharing Scheme]( (here's a [simple python implementation](
2) store your bitcoins in a multi-signature address, requiring M of N private keys to release the funds.
@_date: 2014-03-12 18:59:35
A few wallets are working on implementing "send to OneName handle" features. Stay tuned!

Sorry to hear you couldn't get your first name! What about trying your full name? Or what about creating an account for BitPOS?
@_date: 2014-06-17 05:49:21
Yes, quite true regarding non-outsource-able puzzles. Not my area of expertise, but I'm very glad there are at least a few people working on solving these problems, and there should be more.
As far as I understand the most recent description of Treechains, SPV mode would still be possible and actually quite convenient. Let's say you only have one address - then you only need to watch the single twig (follow the branch far down) in the tree that corresponds to your address. If you have 8 addresses, you only need to watch 8 twigs. If you want many, many addresses but only want to store 1/1024th of the blockchain, then you repeatedly generate addresses until you only get addresses in a single 10-level down branch.
@_date: 2014-08-11 02:43:15
It's possible to use bitcoin for this, but onename has all of the name functionality already built in. There are still some challenges to overcome with implementation on top of the bitcoin blockchain.
@_date: 2014-03-10 14:54:25
Yes, you can edit it by downloading Namecoin-Qt and performing a "name update" operation with your private key.
We realize not everyone will find that easy to do, so we're working on a profile updating tool and should be done with it within a day or two.
@_date: 2014-03-10 15:55:53
If you use the default settings in the profile builder, yes, you have to trust that we aren't storing the private keys.
However, if you change the Bitcoin address from the default one, then you don't have to trust that we don't have access to your funds. Further, as soon as you receive your username, you can transfer it to a new Namecoin address. You have complete control, and thus you don't need to trust us.
And you can absolutely change the Bitcoin address in the profile editor. The address provided is just a default one (for people who either don't have a bitcoin address yet or are too lazy to go and grab one of their existing addresses).
@_date: 2014-03-10 18:54:31
There are multiple Namecoin namespaces. d/ is the domain namespace. We're using an entirely new namespace for OneName usernames: u/.

Hi, Ryan from Onename here. I'm not sure how they implemented the Onename integration but if they are pulling it directly from the Namecoin blockchain, then they are not using a centralized API.
And we created a very simple tool for people to do exactly that:  All you have to do is run `opendig -u gavin` in the command line.

Hi, I was also at the meetup and I can honestly say that I was pretty surprised by the behavior there. Most of the Bitcoin meetups I've attended were not bad at all, but this one was exactly as Arianna described.
@_date: 2014-07-06 23:27:38
Yeah this is a big problem. Also one of the reasons we at onename.io wanted to associate usernames with bitcoin addresses in the blockchain. If your wallet has support for querying multiple Namecoin block explorers, then it can be sure it's getting the right address when you type in a given name.
@_date: 2014-03-10 15:42:58
Hey Gavin, glad you asked.
The protocol has specifications for verification of bitcoin addresses, twitter accounts, github accounts, etc.
In the future, profile explorers will have a verified symbol next to accounts, for communicating authenticity.
Our profile creator currently doesn't support account verification, but we will support that crucial component of the protocol ASAP.
As far as your username goes, we have already reserved +gavinandresen for you. Please shoot me an email (ryan and I can get you set up.
@_date: 2014-07-01 19:06:03
really sorry about that - We've had some troubles with username requests and with our new username reservation system we'll be sending out emails to all of you.

@_date: 2014-08-01 16:51:54
I understand your concern but our motivations for doing this are quite the opposite - we're big proponents of being able to control your own data as well as being able to have sufficient privacy. As mentioned you can create throwaway accounts with aliases instead of real names. Also, we're going to support stealth addresses at some point soon, which means that you'll be able to put your payment details out in public without anyone being able to track your payments.

Hi, Ryan from onename here. When we help partners integrate onename payments, we actually recommend they query the blockchain directly over using our API. We even open-sourced tools for anyone to either query multiple Namecoin servers and corroborate the data or run their own Namecoin instances if they are so inclined.
opendig on github: 
or just do "pip install opendig"

Apps like snapchat and whatsapp have been taking market share away from Facebook. What happens when the next snapchat is built on a decentralized platform like the blockchain? You don't have to sacrifice a good user experience for decentralization. It's just that nobody has done it yet.

As Muneeb mentioned, we're working on a profile updating tool for the typical user and should have it out in the next couple of days.
In the meantime, if you're somewhat tech savvy, you can update your profile as follows:
1. download/install Namecoin-Qt or Namecoind
2. use the OneName profile builder and grab the JSON
3. calculate your WIF formatted private key from the passphrase (just a sha256 then a conversion to base58check - you can use  for that)
4. import your WIF into your namecoin client (you should now see the username in your possession)
5. perform a "name update" operation with the new JSON profile data
@_date: 2014-03-05 17:02:15
Do you have the schematics for this? I'd love to see.
@_date: 2014-06-13 21:35:24
I'm really disappointed by all the negative comments here and lack of interest in what I believe to be a very good article, as much as you'd hate to admit it.
(not that it matters, this article topped Hacker News, so clearly some people value the perspective).
But anyway...
The article is a legitimate call to start focusing on solutions to avoid the centralization of mining power. Yes, the author doesn't have a silver bullet, but he is highlighting the need for a change and even pointed to suggestions by people thinking about solutions ( The sad thing is that even if someone came up with a solution, but the community didn't feel that a mining pool getting 51% wasn't that likely (that they'll self-regulate) or that a 51% attack was unlikely (that they are 100% altruistic and non-coerce-able), then the solution would not get implemented. The key thing here is that there is sufficient reason for people to put their heads together and treat this as a much more serious matter than they treated it before. There is a problem here and we need to address it.
@_date: 2014-07-09 13:58:02
Ah yes, we are looking to support BIP00070!
However, I wouldn't say they are solving the same problem. This requires a link, and it's not as simple as "here's my username, pay me" ("go to C N N DOT COM"). That said, it can work quite well with a decentralized namespace where data such as BIP70 urls can be stored.

Thanks for the feedback, updated!
@_date: 2014-07-09 13:41:24
I agree, typos are a problem. Here's one proposal:
After users register a name, hash the name and calculate the checksum. Then convert that to a base 10 number and give the last 5 digits to the user. This is their "public verification pin."
This pin, which would make it highly highly unlikely for misspelling errors to occur, could be required for high value transfers of money.
@_date: 2014-05-10 20:38:37
Glad you mentioned this. It's one of the things we're trying to do with onename.io. And we'll be working on supporting stealth addresses soon.
@_date: 2014-03-08 22:22:36
I noticed some of the other replies to you have some enormous misinformation and are most definitely not secure.
I know of two ACTUALLY SECURE methods for storing access to your funds in multiple locations:
1) split your private key using a cryptographically secure secret sharing scheme, such as [Shamir's Secret Sharing Scheme]( (here's a [simple python implementation](
2) store your bitcoins in a multi-signature address, requiring M of N private keys to release the funds.
The former is the simpler way to go, and is quite secure. The only concern is that there is a moment during which you must reconstruct the private key on a machine in order to move your funds. With the latter method, there is never an instance in which the locked address is vulnerable to snooping of a single private key.
Note that these methods can be combined too.
@_date: 2014-06-14 01:32:00
Aaaand the response...














See I can cross-post comments from hacker news too :)
@_date: 2014-03-12 04:40:59
I totally agree. Users should have the option to use either a public address or one that they'd like to keep private. We're working on getting OneName to support both hierarchical deterministic addresses and stealth addresses.
@_date: 2014-03-12 20:43:17
Yes for sure. Regular addresses, stealth addresses, and HD addresses each have their own advantages. Users of OneName should be able to choose, so we're working to update the protocol and infrastructure to support all three.
@_date: 2014-08-11 02:42:49
I'd note that Onename supports account verifications as well. As you can see from this profile:
...we know that "gavin" on onename is the same person as "gavinandresen" on github, but we can't conclude that it's the same person as "gavinandresen" on twitter.
@_date: 2014-07-09 14:12:04
Sorry, just got my numbers right. 5 digits, 16 bits.
@_date: 2014-08-11 02:12:36
Well I'd point out that there are many namecoin namespaces and each namespace only as good as how many people find it useful and how often they are using it. The namespace we are using (u/) has by far the most activity and the most users, whereas d/ and id/ are each heavily squatted and under-utilized. We'll be coming out with a blog post shortly with an analysis of all the namecoin namespaces. Stay tuned.
@_date: 2014-07-29 18:18:34
Hi, can you please let us know which account it was? Your profile data is actually put in the blockchain, so we don't have the ability to remove traces of your account.

No! That passphrase we gave you is a brain wallet! We're working on improving the process.
@_date: 2014-03-12 18:26:53
Happy to! It's like a phone book for Bitcoin. Instead of sharing looking up a long string of charcters that is your bitcoin address and sharing it with someone, you can just share your username and the intended recipient will be able to find your profile and make the payment. Easy!
@_date: 2014-08-28 17:42:16
I think you're misunderstanding me here. I'm specifically talking about opendig, which gets bitcoin addresses directly from the blockchain.
electrum servers : namecoind nodes :: electrum clients : apps with opendig
As I mentioned very clearly in my last comment, we recommend against using the API and instead promote using opendig. Edit: Specifically, we recommend apps use opendig to connect to multiple instances of namecoind. This allows for the corroboration of data without SPV (and yes it isn't perfect, but it prevents a great deal of attacks). Namecoin SPV would be ideal but that hasn't been implemented as of yet.
@_date: 2014-07-01 17:09:33

Hi I understand where you're coming from.
We had built something that we thought was cool and thought about taking longer and fixing this and that but we knew how product can keep creeping and never get to launch. We thought it would be better to just put something out there, and it turned out the community loved it. I'm sorry you had a bad experience with the delays for us to release the edit page, but we'll work hard to make sure that doesn't happen again.
The github just contains the protocol specs for now, but we're going to be releasing code and we definitely encourage any and all to participate and contribute.
@_date: 2014-03-12 18:34:41
Yes, just sweep the private key into blockchain.info. And yes, you're right. We're working on a method that will improve this process.
@_date: 2014-07-09 13:34:40
Yes, that's a risk but that's not what's meant by secure.
Thought experiment: modify Namecoin to use only base32 ( and there will be no such confusions.
@_date: 2014-03-10 21:28:00
Yes, exactly. Your private key (in hex form) is simply the sha256 of the passphrase. You can import the hex private key into a onename wallet by it into base58check form and running importprivkey. We're working on making this more intuitive.

The wallet can pull the data when the user types in the username, pre-fill the bitcoin field, and say "this is the picture of the user you want to pay, this is the publicly verified twitter account of the person you want to pay and here is the tweet to prove it - are you sure this is correct?"
How we doin?

I believe a stealth address will work just fine. We'll need to look more into this though. We're also working on supporting hierarchical deterministic wallets.
@_date: 2014-08-17 12:07:37
Here it is in a nutshell:
The blockchain lets us store data, and if we use the namecoin blockchain, we can store structured data. Now, with this data we can represent relationships like "following" and "followed by". Then a website can read this data and display it in a pretty way. Further, if each user owns his/her own private key for the data in the blockchain, then each user is in full control of his/her social connections.
Does this cover everything? Happy to clarify anything further.

I totally understand what you're saying here, and is absolutely right.
As I mentioned earlier, we recommend that clients connect to multiple instances of namecoind and corroborate the data. This prevents a great deal of attacks but isn't perfect. But if I am using Hive for iOS and it supports Onename and connects to multiple instances of Namecoind, one of which is run by Hive itself, I'd feel more comfortable.
Now, Onename with Namecoin SPV would absolutely be ideal, however this hasn't been implemented as of yet. Stay tuned.

It's free.

Thanks Justin!
@_date: 2014-08-11 02:10:48
Yes, that's correct. In fact, anyone can grab the information by querying the blockchain. And we at onename even open-sourced some tools like opendig ( to make this extremely easy.
@_date: 2014-06-13 21:41:29
Fine, but your original statement was quite an unfair knee-jerk one.

I'll pledge 0.05 BTC if 5 more people do so.

Hey thanks for this detailed answer. I love Multibit - it's my wallet of choice.
And a bit off topic but just curious - do you think Multibit will support "pay by username" with OneName soon?
Looks like Electrum is working on it and Pheeva already has an integration.
@_date: 2014-03-10 17:05:05
The backup system uses shamir's secret sharing, so we have absolutely zero information about your private key. If you lose your passphrase for some reason (don't!) you can contact us with your secret share and we'll combine it with ours to recover your account, then send it to any namecoin address you like. Now if you still don't feel comfortable, you can always transfer your name to another namecoin address right away. But note that in they case we have no way of helping you. Most hardcore bitcoiners shouldn't have a problem with this but many mainstream users will.

This right here should set off some red flags for you. The fact that you have to *believe* that they will stay honest means that it's not a trust-less, untamable, secure currency. The network is *only alright* so long as all players are motivated solely by money AND are perfectly rational players that value the long term over the short term. That takes away all of the innovation of Bitcoin. Instead of being required to trust the US government, (which essentially has the dollar in the palm of its hands, but has no incentive to destroy it), you are required to trust the largest mining pool at or around 51% (which essentially has bitcoin in the palm of its hands, but has no incentive to destroy it). Do you see how with massive mining pools Bitcoin isn't really a decentralized currency? Do you see how it's not secure, wouldn't be attractive to professional investors, doesn't have much potential to go global, and isn't an untamable resource like gold? I'd second guess your over-rationalization here which allows you to cope with the fact that mining pools exist and the fact that it'd be pretty hard to re-decentralize mining. I know it's a hard problem to solve, I get it. But there are absolutely viable proposed solutions to this problem. One of them was described by Andrew Miller ( Another is Peter Todd's tree chains, which, while requires a lot more thinking through, would absolutely prevent mining pool consolidation. There are other proposals and I'm sure there is a viable solution among all of them. The main thing we need right now is impetus.

We're working on the verification system! It'll be out shortly, don't worry, and thanks for your feedback!

Hey Ryan from Onename here. Cool that you brought this up, I'll think a bit about it. Do you use Diaspora? If so can you tell me a little bit about how you use it?
@_date: 2014-03-12 04:41:48
Good point! We're working on an update to the OneName protocol to support hierarchical deterministic addresses.
@_date: 2014-03-10 21:26:53
Ah, thanks for the feedback! You're absolutely right.
@_date: 2014-03-12 19:03:05
Can you please elaborate?
@_date: 2014-08-11 02:17:31
Currently, JustCoin, Pheeva, Electrum (not in the core, as of yet), and a couple others support this feature. I think someone may be working on integrating it into MultiBit as well.
@_date: 2014-07-30 05:31:51
Hi, can you please email support We'll help you sort this out.
@_date: 2014-07-01 17:16:18
For a lot of people keeping track of a long passphrase like that was too cumbersome. We wanted something more user-friendly, something that gave users the ability to choose their own passwords and then have a password reset option available.
@_date: 2014-06-13 21:38:42
No, it's not that simple.
I love Bitcoin, I'm not selling, and I want to see it succeed but at the same time I recognize that there might need to be some key changes to the protocol. I'd like to see us move away from what many consider a fatal flaw - the current incentive structure around mining.
Plus, Bitcoin is much more than just owning a currency - it's a movement. Your perspective irks me.
@_date: 2014-08-28 16:23:58
Love the Onename integration. You guys are awesome, great work.
@_date: 2014-06-13 21:49:35
Well, that's true, no individual or small group can change the protocol, which is a very good thing. However, I do find the tone of your statement to be quite dismissive and immature.
Would you care to explain why there is no reason for concern? Mining power consolidation is a natural property of Bitcoin based on the current incentive system. This has happened before. Even if miners move away from GHash, we're only sweeping the problem under the rug to come back and bite us later. The thing is, incentives in this system are broken. Bitcoin *must* be incentive compatible to continue to be decentralized and secure.
@_date: 2014-03-10 17:07:32
We should make this clearer, sorry for the confusion. You can get the private key for your default address by calculating the sha256 of the passphrase you wrote down.
@_date: 2014-03-10 15:10:33
Yes, we looked into "id/", but for various reasons decided to go with an entirely new namespace. "id/" has been subject to a lot of name squatting, and we believe that by starting anew, we can provide a better experience for users.
@_date: 2014-07-29 17:44:30
No not at all. In fact, we intend to add stealth addresses soon. That way, your transactions are anonymous but people know how to pay you.
@_date: 2014-03-12 18:31:00
1. No, this is not possible currently. However, we're working on a verification system. Stay tuned!
2. Just in case someone loses their passphrase, we send them a recovery code and keep one ourselves. Each code has 0 info about the secret, but combined they reconstruct the secret. The algo behind this is shamir's secret sharing.
3. Yes, we're working on implementing that. Thanks for the feedback!

The Namecoin node they're connecting to doesn't need to be on the android phone. They can either set up a node for themselves or connect to other nodes using RPC. They can also connect to multiple nodes at a time and corroborate the data. If they set up their own namecoin node, they can put it behind a private API endpoint for the android apps to call.
We highly recommend using opendig over our API, and simply provide the API for convenience. And if using opendig, we highly recommend using your own namecoind instances, but we recognize that not everyone will do this (the relationship here is similar to the relationship between electrum servers and electrum clients).
@_date: 2014-08-17 12:04:32
The actual followers aren't stored in the blockchain - only a URI reference to a "graph file", which has all the user relationships in json format that can be stored anywhere, like s3, for example. Also the namecoin blockchain makes it really simple to store structured JSON data. This ends up being quite efficient and is actually what we're doing now at onename.

What's your OneName handle? I'll look into it.

We're working on putting out a profile editor - we'll have that ready ASAP! In the mean time, you can always edit it using Bitcoin-Qt or bitcoind (but we realize this is too out of the way for most people). Stay tuned!

Hi, Ryan from onename here. We're going to be releasing stealth addresses at some point in the future. When that happens, all of your privacy concerns should be addressed. And as far as identity theft, what are your concerns? We're focusing hard on building trust into the system and preventing impersonation. You may have noticed that we launched verifications recently, for example.
@_date: 2014-03-25 20:48:49
The default Bitcoin address we generated for you is derived from your passphrase, which acts as a brain wallet. Only you have access to the funds in your address as only you have the passphrase and thus the recipe for generating the private key. We currently don't have functionality on OneName.io for you to spend your Bitcoins but you can currently generate your WIF private key and import it into a wallet like MultiBit or Bitcoin-Qt.
    
One way to do this is to download and open a local copy of brainwallet.org ( and input your passphrase there (I wouldn't recommend using the live site, as they could conceivably snoop your PKs).
    
Hope this is helpful. We're working on improving the process and making it much simpler for the end user.
@_date: 2014-03-10 12:53:22
Yes! We believe that such an open identity protocol forms the basis for a better identity verification process.
Check out the protocol specs on GitHub. They include methods for proving ownership of bitcoin addresses, twitter accounts, github accounts, etc.

Hi Miles, you can absolutely sign up for a new username with a different email address. And we currently don't have a "change email" feature right now, but we're adding one soon and if you email support we can help you out.

It'd actually be really simple to build a "pay by twitter handle" app on top of OneName. All user data is crawl-able and easily digestible in JSON format. All you'd need to do is proces the user db embedded in the blockchain and create a lookup table of twitter handle -&gt; bitcoin address.
@_date: 2014-08-11 11:00:15
Hi there, Ryan from onename here. We are just as concerned as you of using a centralized party for identity management, but I'd point out that onename is far from a centralized system.
OneName is using Namecoin as a decentralized namespace and store of user data. Because of this, anyone can query the blockchain directly and get the appropriate data for a given user. In addition, users do not need to sign up through our site to be listed in the directory and appear on the site - they can actually register with their Namecoin client. Last, when you're browsing our site, we give you a URL to check the data directly in the blockchain and provide URLs to sites other than our own, so that you can corroborate the data and (if you're careful enough) can eliminate the risk of MITM attacks.
We're always improving and highly motivated to build out a decentralized system that's both secure and convenient for users, so if you have any other suggestions please do let us know.
@_date: 2014-03-09 15:53:14
Perhaps, but that's the wrong way to explain it, as that's not how SSSS works at all. With M/N SSSS, if you have M-1 shares, you have absolutely zero information about the secret. That is quite different from the system he described.
