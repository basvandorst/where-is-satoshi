Think about human emotions. It rises so high really fast, people sell. It drops just enough then slows down to a steady place and people have their mind of its recent success they want to buy in now at a much lower price then it’s ATH. It will rise for sure.

Someone reassure me that me buying in so late is still a good idea.

You’re thinking too small. It’s the idea behind what blockchain entails. It’s a reduction of uncertainty of digital assets, not just currency, but everything; including identity. 
It’s a record system that cannot be tampered with. It takes away government. What about a digital ID? It would be able to prove identity through verifying on the public ledger.

I think presenting the decentralized nature to college students is key. Using these ideas of smart contracts through record keeping can play into other aspects of life in general. How much easier, more transparent, and safer it makes life. 
I’ve read a bit about supply chains being a big one. The transparency to verify a supply chain to its origin. You could verify where your food is coming from. This could help in making better choices for how we impact our environment.

If you present it right, the blockchain is extremely exciting.

Identify is a huge obstacle for the digital age, but I don’t believe it will be that easy. I imagine using other sources in tandem for verification purposes, which the blockchain can store.
