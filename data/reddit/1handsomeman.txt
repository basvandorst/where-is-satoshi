Yeah, that's a weird mental block. Just think of it instead as all the whole satoshi you are buying. Millions of satoshi!

The author is speaking of transactions costs not the spot price.

It should be fine. I tried a little deposit the other day and it took 4 or 5 hours. They are having scaling issues I believe.

Use the standard metric prefix mBTC. (milliBitcoin)
Or use the bitcoin subunit satoshi.
Would you rather have a fraction of something (1 mBTC) or 100k satoshi? Even though it is the same thing it has psychological implications.

Should have started with satoshis from the get go. People would rather have 100k satoshi than a fraction of a bitcoin e.g. 1 mBTC

I'm already seeing blocks exceeding 0.8 MB within the last few days so we may start to see this becoming a problem sooner rather than later.

Each transaction contains data. If the amount of transactions/data exceeds current block size limits (currently 1MB), then transactions would be delayed until the next block is mined.

Not necessarily. You receive credits whenever funds are deposited to your bank account, the opposite being a debit.
