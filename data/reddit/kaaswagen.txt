The marginal costs to do *something* in the digital space are rather low, there's also that

I'm researching this as well, but it looks like CoinKite is the cutting edge right now. Their terminal looks pretty sweet, but I haven't tried in IRL

My primary interest in bitcoin is technical: I have no specific purpose for the funds but would like to play around with it

What kind of hoops do I have to jump through on circle to get the coins under my control?

Why not cash out a bit and invest in stock that reap good dividend and tell her that you've been saving a bit of your paycheck to invest in stocks that'll generate more income for the family?

Jezus Christ, "more complex". This dude is going to show up with working wormholes if the past is any indication of the future with that statement, he reminds me of Ozzie Issacs in Hamiltons Commonwealth saga..

Let's hope not! I have (some) faith, especially now that bitcoin seems to be going mainstream.

Welp, karmadecay didn't find it (still [doesn't]( I really liked the interview as well, this guy has thought it through quite well it seems. Too bad imho the lady doesn't ask any real hard questions, but more or less provides some glue to the seams of his (rehearsed) story.

Not to mention merchants who, most likely, will kill for a chance to eliminate chargebacks and credit card fees

But there is the implication of gain, which can be cashed out. Not the same, but could be seen as investing nonetheless


This is where a comparison doesn't hold up, true


But it's strongly implied in terms of capital gain. That's why you see headlines with X% gain in the last X months.


But this certainly hasn't been the case since it's inception, so it might be easily seen as integral to the system. 
I agree it's not a Ponzi scheme, but to an outsider/poorly informed individual it is certainly easy to misinterpret

Now let's hope that year to date return [of 5307%]( can be matched!

Yeah, and pays dividend. But no, the stock market is not a Ponzi scheme.

By shutting silk road down they probably opened a can of worms, I wouldn't be surprised if there are a lot of new competitors in that space.

Why not? Fiat flows in at the bottom level, people who never had bitcoin are buying in and quite possibly there are people at the top cashing out. 
Please note I have a stake in bitcoin and want to see it take over the traditional banking systems, but it could be a Ponzi
@_date: 2013-11-11 16:08:58
But this is much like the age old problem of employees taking a few bucks out of the register and should be controlled in just the same way. EG: (at least where I am from) the digital transactions are done via proprietary software with some security, the same should be done for bitcoin, with a vendor that you trust.

Stocks are backed by actual business, verified through accountant statements. Bitcoin is more a Ponzi scheme in the sense that if we stop believing it and everyone tries to cash out, it turns out the value we expected was based on nothing more than trust.

Some good quotes to take from this (I think);
"On the blockcahin no-one knows you are a fridge" [link]
(    
"it's (bitcoin) a very sophisticated globally distributed asset register" [link](
