for the love of god, I can't think of a good reason why a private entity has the legal right to print money...
My main reason for liking bitcoin^^^ really don’t have much of an issue with anything besides that the federal reserve can do what it does
@_date: 2018-09-04 01:12:23
i don't think its going to be a solution to those shit shows. I would like it to be an alternative way to store, transfer, wealth that is commonly recognized as legal tender for forms of payment. Therefore, people will have control of their own value and not be forced to rely on the services of a bank and take on the financial risk that banks takes on but loaning the money it doesn't have. This gives people an alternative route to transact other than the system of control that is the US dollar. The government and banks use money as a system of control, google the video from Andreas Antonopoulos about about this topic.

I understand where you are coming from. The bank provides a service that is pretty beneficial in the micro however the entire macro system is flawed. I'm sure you understand what fractional reserve style of banking is. I'm also sure you understand the flaws of "creating money" through this style of banking. You will see, in years to come when student loans continue to spiral out of control and we have a market correction or crash and during this time of crisis people will default on these loans, and you will then see why the banks aren't your friends, especially when your tax dollars are used to bail them out. literally anyone can go get an auto-loan with little to nothing down. Does that remind you of 2008 at all? I think it should, and it should also remind you the amount of people who lost everything they had during these times. Just because the US has been very strong economically since then, you can't forget the big picture.
@_date: 2018-09-01 19:40:08
It is absolutely already a world wide currency. However, I think in this context it means "official" world wide currency as in worldwide legal tender. Also, could be referring to the aspect of bitcoin could become a global reserve currency held by governments/corporations/institutes in large quantities and commonly transacted in all aspects of global economy.

what does the internet have to do with financial collapse?
@_date: 2018-09-01 12:43:59
I'm right there with you man, as of right now. My position is based on the assumption things will improve and get stronger. I also don't think that PayPal/credit cards will go away if they adapt to changing times. If these huge companies, adapt, and integrate btc in to their services than they will continue to be a huge part of the payment processing ecosystem. But as the technology changes, the corporations have to adapt or competition will run them out. (Blockbuster/netflix, and toysRus/amazon comes to mind). I don't necessarily want btc to be the only currency, I just want it to grow as an alternative worldwide currency. I agree with you the issues certain smart contracts could have at the moment, and that is a clue play for a third party entity if people are willing to pay for their services. The big guys aren't going to go away, they will stay in control, I just want to be able to have control of my own wealth.
@_date: 2018-09-03 22:16:48
And this has nothing to do with paying for a service. I have no issues paying fees for these services, or paying interest(actually love debt, leverage is a necessity).But I have an issue with the way the banks practice their banking, and how and why it affects all of us. in the day to day for an average person, I can see why you don't have any issues with the banks. As the technology improves and scales over time, and the dollar is continuously weakened, the banks will either adapt to the technology, or be defeated. think amazon uber Airbnb, market disruptors and the people who own the market share either adapt or die. same will happen here if technology is capable of beating tis scaling issues.
@_date: 2018-09-01 12:21:05
its a shitty software ran to process payments that usually require you to mail a check. Therefore this software is charging fees on top of credit card transactions, PayPal fees, because people will pay extra for convenience. 
@_date: 2018-09-01 20:00:01
�� Easy as sending an email so simple. People will learn takes time man. 
@_date: 2018-09-01 12:27:19
I completely understand that. I just believe in bitcoin and blockchain, I believe we will have new products built on top of the blockchain that allow for the pros of centralized databases. For example, a freelancer will use a product that develops a smart contract between two people only executing when both parties deliver. Convincing someone to give you anything to join a Ponzi scheme is always going to be fraud, and frankly, besides the point. I do agree with you that stupidity is the problem, and education is the solution. The issue is that will never happen, so I think as the tech evolves it will make it so easy, simple, and secure, that everyone will be able to use btc. thats when we will be able to be adopted globally. That is years away in my opinion, and in todays time, there are a lot of better alternatives. Just like in 1992 when it was easier for the average person to drive to the store than try to get on this dang internet thingy and order it online. Times have changed, and times will continue to change. I'm betting on the future, not based off the data of today.
@_date: 2018-09-01 12:10:10
I agree with you but chargebacks because of a fraud in my opinion is a lack of security issue causing these fraud transactions. if people were educated how to create and properly store a private key than these fraud transactions would happen a hell of a lot less and would be unneccessary to have a 3rd party intermediary to fix the problems that wouldn't happen. I mean its just ridiculous to me that you can find a wallet, grab their credit card, and start spending. no wonder fraudulent transactions happen, and with this system a chargeback system has to be in place to right the wrongs. what if no wrongs ever took place? would you need someone to make things right?
@_date: 2018-09-01 11:50:24
right there with you man. I feel the same way everytime I get stuck in the bank, or send money overseas makes me really conceptualize the value of the bitcoin and lightning network.
@_date: 2018-08-31 13:51:25
Wouldn’t that depend on how fast you want the transaction confirmed, how many sat/byte you pay, are you including fees to purchase the btc as well? 
@_date: 2018-08-22 12:03:42
In my opinion, we don't want institutions to have control over the currency, as in what we have with fiat. The government and banks use fiat money as a system of control, and bitcoin is permission-less and immutable. 
However, if said entities would like to use bitcoin, its simply an increase in demand, decrease in available supply, which would lead to an increase in price, and they still don't have any control over MY bitcoin, only their own. 
@_date: 2018-08-31 13:33:13
I swear every time I try to make a payment online there is always 3,4,5$ transaction fees. No big deal on big transfers but when sending a small amount it’s ludicrous. Luckily my county accepts bitcoin for taxes, and basically anything you pay for at DMV. Haven’t done it yet but plan to
@_date: 2018-08-31 14:07:21
True, there are definitely services already that make it hard to quantify crypto in that respect. You have to remember not to compare as payment processors though and remember to compare the currency being used. Sure, some services allow you to transfer fiat for free but the problem is moreso the “fiat” and not the medium of exchange. Fiat money is used as a system of control and bitcoin is permissonless. I will happily pay more to have control of my own value than free services using shit fiat.
@_date: 2018-08-31 23:32:30

The volatility in this market is due to a relatively low market cap allowing for easy price manipulation and volatility. As the market cap grows, as well as liquidity, the volatility will lessen. Therefore once we have reached a stage of higher mass adoption then the price fluctuation will be much less drastic day to day, but due to the deflationary nature of bitcoin it will grow in value. This will allow for btc to be used as a stronger medium of exchange but by that time the price will be through the roof, this is still very early in regards to adoption of technology and percent of global money supply. Hold on, it’s gonna be a fun ride. (Just my opinion)
@_date: 2018-05-26 18:01:17
Thanks! Yea I actually hold some MCO.  Due to the fact of there being so many is why I’m having trouble pinpointing the right one. Thank you I’ll look into those ones you named. ��
@_date: 2018-08-31 16:06:47
I paid for convenience. To be honest, my issue isnt with fees or anything. I have no problem paying a fee for transactions, it’s the cost of doing business. My issue is more with the currency itself and many key factors of fiat currency that i don’t agree with. I posted this for fun because it was an example of high payments for simple processing. There are many free services to transfer money, i just would rather used a fixed supply currency than one backed by production. 
@_date: 2018-08-31 13:47:23
Good point. I agree.

@_date: 2018-08-31 13:54:01
Lol at the edit, I hear you. I just mean that I believe btc will continue to scale and transactions will become cheaper over time. And we will take down these crooked institutions.

Honestly not made up man. Just bought a house a few months ago and owed the association for my HOA payment. Yes, I could have mailed a check but I’m a 22 year old and I don’t really use paper checks/mail service. Noticed the heavy fees for simple payment processing and as a bitcoin enthusiast thought it would be fun to share. 
@_date: 2018-08-31 15:45:20
Correct x2. Just a post for fun.
@_date: 2018-08-22 12:05:17
Absolutely agreed. 
@_date: 2018-09-03 21:48:00
its not about the bank I used, its about the fact that I wanted to pay over the internet rather than mail a check, in order to pay this type of bill  I had to pay these heavy fees for "convenience". it was simply a comparison to the shitty payment processors there are out there to bitcoin. calm down. everyone is so bearish and depressed these days just trying to support the community a little bit. its sad that you can even try to defend a bank, makes me feel that its unlikely you understand the banking industry.
@_date: 2018-05-15 11:13:01
Greshams law, therefore I will hodl my btc, and spend my shit fiat. for the record, I live in this county so I think it is cool for adoption in the area but personally, id rather keep my btc
@_date: 2018-05-15 21:57:03
Somewhat was referring to the idea that people will spend the fiat which is inflating and hoard the btc which is appreciating over time and gaining purchasing power rather than losing it
@_date: 2018-08-31 16:58:09
Exactly. He’s just referring to typical credit card transactions where the payment is accepted immediately although it hasn’t been processed yet.
@_date: 2018-10-05 15:36:28

The original comment was sarcasm. Do not use bitmex with leverage, extremely risky you will lose all your money. Buy only what you can afford to lose, maybe one initial buy right now while prices are low and market is red, then maybe contributing a small amount every month to buy more and increase your stack. Spend it when you can and immediately replace it with the fiat you would have used to spend on that item. Use coinbase pro only and limit orders only and you will avoid all fees. Then immediately after purchasing send to cold storage, (wallet that is offline and you control your private keys) I recommend a hardware wallet such as Ledger S Nano or Trezor, but you can use a desktop wallet as well. Think long term like 5-10 years in the future minimum, not that you will cash out in days/weeks/months.

I believe he is referring to 25 million wallet addresses. (Which definitely means significantly less users)
@_date: 2018-06-05 16:03:39
Not sure how you could measure that as well, only txs on the Blockchain that can be measured daily. To determine if someone is moving funds between their own wallets versus payment would be difficult imo. 
@_date: 2018-06-05 11:23:24
I would agree, and it all really depends on how you consider someone a “user” 
@_date: 2019-04-22 22:19:11
If you bought let's say 1 bitcoin @ $13,000.
Then the price doubles, so 1 bitcoin is now $26,000.
If you decide to sell half in order to recupe your initial investment.
Then you would be selling .5 bitcoin @ $6,500 cost, for $13,000, which would be a $6,500 capital gain.
So yes, if you are in the green when you sell, there will be a tax liability.
I see how you could think there was no gain made, because the cash inflow vs outflow was equal, but you did not sell the entire asset, you only sold part of the asset, and there was a gain on part of that asset. 
So in your situation, lets say your 1 bitcoin went to 15,000, and you were happy with your profit like you mentioned, and you sold only enough to get back your original investment of 13,000. Keeping the remainder in crypto to play around with alts and ICOs.
You would be selling .8667btc for $13,000, that you paid $11,266.67 for, therefore there would be a $1,733.33 capital gain.
You would still have unrealized gains on the .1333 bitcoin that you had still in your wallet.
Does that make sense?

Hey man, I understand what you are saying. My apologies, a condescending tone was not my intent. That’s my opinion and that’s my lifestyle and it’s the issues I see with many people these days. It had no direction towards your situation at all. Everyone has a different situation in different areas with different income levels so my opinion may not be accurate across the board. I was making 50-70k bar tending in touristy bars in Florida working the heavy seasons in many locations. The property I purchased was 165k so definitely different than in your area. I just get a little annoyed with people who do nothing to improve themselves or their career, make minimum wage and work minimal hours and then come to the internet to complain about how impossible their living situations are. Trust me man, I wish I had bought more btc back then! I had many opportunities to purchase bitcoin between 2012-2016 and unfortunately I did not understand the tech and it was too scammy/speculative for me. Good luck to you man, I hope bitcoin moons and we all get rich.

I have been working my ass off my entire life, saving my money, living within my means. I have been very entrepreneurial my entire life, manufacturing and selling custom homemade skateboards when I was in high school, between stock trading/crypto trading, managing bars/bartending, and working in customer service since I was 12 years old (got paid 1.50 an hour lol). If you work your ass off and don't try to be fancy, then there is a lot out there to be made and earned. I could have had a BMW and 25 Jordans but instead never bought myself a thing and let it grow over the years.

Understood, again I was trying to understand the practicality of being able to catch you from the IRS point of view. No worries this was all theoretical anyways, nobody is going to pay me in bitcoin lol I don’t even know anybody who has bitcoin. I understand it is illegal to underreport but was wondering how they will catch you.  Not like I’m depositing too much in my bank account and they can check it. How will they even know my wallet address?

Thank you very much for your thoughtful post. I completely agree with you on the evasion part.

Hey guys, I am 21 and I just bought my first home! its a 3/3 and I plan on renting the other two bedrooms. I am considering accepting bitcoin for rent  (instead of shit fiat). If I understand correctly, there would not be a taxable event until I sell the coins, and have income tax or capital gains tax.Or is there an immediate tax liability due to it being rental income?

Ha right, its more so that I want to help support adoption and use cases. I know the volatility is strong, therefore you could charge a flat btc rate that you come to an agreement on, and always can change the agreement as market value changes

I have 1 coin set aside for long term that I plan to not ever get rid of until I can spend it to buy a home completely out right, not sell for fiat but send it to someone where the price on the home is 1 btc. That will be the day.
