Millennials know fuck all about wealth. They blindly love bitcoin. I say this because of the whole occupy Wall Street nonsense that went on. Most of them had no idea what they were doing there. But the ones that hodl will indeed see the fruits later

That’s tough m8 I chose to buy back when it was at 17k before every idiot on twitter with spare change decided to hop on the ‘trend’ I was at work watching my money dwindle. Now i just decide at this point to hold because I’m in too deep to just give up

I started buying a couple months before the price peaked in 2017, I didn’t buy for a good year and a half after that. I have a pretty good understanding of bitcoin. But I get what you mean, half of this sub consists of memes and rollercoasters. I’m basically all in on what this currency can hold for the future. However if I was uninformed on what this really is, I would no doubt feel like I’m getting scammed. I refuse to sell because I know the value will bounce back harder. But deep down I almost feel like my money is being held hostage. Currently where I stand I have not profited from Bitcoin.

I swear every time I buy bitcoin this fucking happens. I’m in it for the long term but fucking hell it happens every single time. In other news stock market had a pretty good day.

What a load of crap. Shows how uninformed the community actually is. This will only deceive new adopters and turn them off when free isn’t the case when moving money.
