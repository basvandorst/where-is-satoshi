what kind of question is this?
@_date: 2016-08-16 07:03:21
Youre trying, I respect that. You have opinions, I respect that.  I disagree with so many of them.  I feel there is a good chance you're new to the space.  That's just my opinion.    
@_date: 2016-04-09 03:57:18
Just use it at this point.

what are you trying to ask?
@_date: 2015-06-12 06:22:15
Have you called and talked to Black Sheep about if the accepted  bitcoin.  I know they were on coinmaps accepting it, but i went there about 2 months ago and they had stopped.  They had told me one day they accepted bitcoin then the next day after a $40 bill they told me no.  I live in Provo so ill stop by and double check.  
@_date: 2015-06-13 05:43:46
Awesome ill be going their for lunch Sat.

Youre right, this makes since.  How do we implament this into bitcoin?  Someone should write code to make each bitcoin worth $125,000.
@_date: 2014-08-15 04:43:44

@_date: 2014-12-11 16:20:30
As far as investing in bitcoin, if you look at it as a long term thing (6-10 years) i think right now is not a bad time.  Lots of people have been hurt putting way to much money they couldnt afford into bitcoin at the top of bubbles.  If you put what you can afford and invest for long term i think its worth a little risk.  
@_date: 2014-05-13 07:46:55
Question.  By donating bitcoin to any public rep, does it give legal reason for people to follow the block chain and see where youre money has been?
@_date: 2014-01-15 21:22:40
That would be Litecoin Mining not bitcoin...
@_date: 2014-10-06 20:57:29
Understand that at this point r/bitcoin has more trolls then ever.  Just dont be so surprised when things like this happen.

@_date: 2014-01-26 08:49:53
I feel you are new to crypto.  I feel like you put everything into bitcoin without research.  Just a feeling.
@_date: 2014-05-25 05:54:29
ceiling $4,500 and will drop back to $3,200 for the floor. Oct. 
@_date: 2014-12-31 19:52:17
Yeah?  Please tell me how they would do this?  
@_date: 2014-05-16 23:05:08
Im going to hold for 10 years.  If bitcoin hits $10k, its already a big deal and 10 years from now i think we could see numbers close to golds market cap.  
@_date: 2014-10-27 19:48:08
Its the top post on right now.  I got a feel of it from the comments.  
@_date: 2014-09-09 06:58:23
Fuck others that downvote (im drunk) but i thought it was funny!
@_date: 2014-08-15 21:40:10
It really kind of is stock. I mean bitcoin. Is just the rewards system for miners to keep the blockchain secure. Once you have billion dollar services on the blockchain the price of each bitcoin must stay within some kind of profitable area for the blockchain to be secure. So in a way, bitcoin is stock on blockchain security. 
@_date: 2014-10-31 18:07:10
Yeah it was put up in April of this year.

@_date: 2014-09-10 18:50:02
I've been talking to my friends and family about bitcoin for two years. The only person that had got one was my mom. Well in the past 2 months I've had 8 different friends ask me how to buy bitcoin or if I would sell them a little. The past two months have been crazy for me.  I'm not sure what's going on but more please? 
@_date: 2014-07-01 07:13:46
I remember getting my first coin from gox at $40 a pop.  Wanted to put the $4,000 i had saved into it but was convinced  to only do $500.  So funny because i had to go threw Western Union and they took 20% of that $500.  I was so pissed.  Im not sure if Bitcoin will work or not as its still an experiment but if it does put you're space helmet on.  ;)
@_date: 2014-05-23 21:04:25
Give me your chips!!!
@_date: 2014-05-02 01:54:00
He also said around 4:55 that he is a "skeptic" of incentive part of bitcoin.  I wish he explained that more.  
@_date: 2014-08-19 19:18:11
I know this happened to this guy: 
He some out got his coins from Mt. Gox. Maybe send him a PM and ask what he did to get them back. Good luck. 
@_date: 2014-12-02 16:04:35
I just feel like a companie like Twitter or Facebook could create its own tipping system giving the user one less place to sing up for also making money them selves.  This is when I see tipping getting big. 
@_date: 2014-06-07 08:10:34
Are we dumb?  Guy is rich.  From what?  Many things im sure, bitcoin being one of them.  Social experiment number 2...

That image is very powerful! 
@_date: 2014-06-27 18:53:35
There isn't even 21 million coins that exist.  Also if someone locks in on a 51% attack and holds the network (someone like large government) that can stop transactions from moving for as long as they hold the 51%.  That could be lethal.  
@_date: 2014-07-09 07:16:35
thank you :)
@_date: 2014-05-25 20:27:23
Oh god yes

i agree.
@_date: 2014-05-12 08:03:05
I really hate this idea.  I think most people that really understand bitcoin give two shits about the current ever changing price.  
@_date: 2014-05-04 02:06:58
more or everyone?
@_date: 2014-10-04 06:51:24
I feel like you dont understand bitcoin.  I doesnt really matter when it happens or even if its bitcoin that happens.  Its that this tech is hear to stay.  In a life time its also going to save you a lot of money.  
@_date: 2014-11-16 22:25:48
Hes got nothing.
@_date: 2014-12-03 19:45:03
The only problem with your case is that when this happens, it will be all banks at once.  So its going to hurt the public very bad.  
@_date: 2014-10-05 23:25:42
Agreed, ill pre-order when i can buy with my coin :) 
@_date: 2014-10-10 20:26:43
Wow that was fast.  Thanks so much. Got my friends in the room already.  
@_date: 2014-08-07 23:52:59

@_date: 2014-11-25 00:52:17
That sucks for you.
@_date: 2014-09-26 20:50:34
I downvoted you just for starting off with "im most likely going ot get downvoted".  Sick of people saying that shit. 
@_date: 2014-07-03 19:59:40
Its a joke... thats it.  If you feel its tacky well then that's your opinion.  
@_date: 2014-09-06 06:36:41
I feel bitcoin will become the backed globel currency.  So yes i think its a great idea.  If you want to ask you can hear why not to buy. 
@_date: 2014-09-18 02:31:39
No you asked them all. 
@_date: 2014-06-30 02:49:53
If you look at the exchanges order book depth, 30,000 btc would drive the price over $2,000 a coin, making an $1,800 coin a discount.  This is not "far out there". 
@_date: 2014-12-30 08:12:47
Mine came from Czech Republic.  Im guessing yours will also.  You may get it faster.  
@_date: 2014-09-02 08:33:08
You cant mine bitcoin with a GPU at this point.  Also 97c will kill your card.  It wont last long at that temp. 
@_date: 2014-06-27 16:54:14
I'm a single guy with no kids.  I would buy a house, car two years of pay ($120,000).  The rest would go to bitcoin.

 There is growth. Bitcoin is in a. Inflationary period. Every 10 min 25 bitcoins are be birthed. People are buy this for the most part. I'm ok with bitcoin going to $100. I personally wouldn't blink an eye. 
@_date: 2014-07-01 08:33:14
More exposure for bitcoin (the subreddit they have already clicked on) or for newegg?  I think exposure will come but 5 post on the exact same post is not needed.  Sure if you bought something on Newegg post it! New video from a news feed about it awesome!  I should have been more  specific in the title. I would just not like to see 5 of the same kind of post on the front page is all.

I would like to see something about block rewards. As every 4 years the reward will be cut in half.  The price would have to represent what it cost to birth the coin, right?

Was Wal-mart not trying to become a bank in its self for a period of time?  Seems like the lost ground and started over.

bitcoin is self banking.  That'ts the joke.  God is it that hard?
@_date: 2014-08-13 01:20:29
I feel like any bitcoiner that had his/her aha moment with in the last 4-6 months will make these claims as when you spend hours and hours day by day reading on bitcoin it WILL inspire.  
I can only speak for my self but i feel after 4-6 months of really reading the implications of bitcoin but understand that its so far away IF its even the best way to do things.  My hope is that little by little bitcoin can provide context on specific issue when needed.  Bitcoin will change everything just as the internet WILL (as it still working to improve) with time.  Just give it time.  
@_date: 2014-05-11 01:19:33

I've been talking for two years to my family about bitcoin. One thing I can tell you doesn't work is shoving it in there face. I think they just hate the word by now. 
@_date: 2014-06-16 21:05:48
Im up and running! 
@_date: 2014-09-17 22:54:27
Then don't... Why come to r/bitcoin and tell us how you spend your money?  Move on please. 
@_date: 2014-10-01 03:46:34
I think companys will use something like counterparty or mastercoin to do these kinds of things.  
@_date: 2014-06-20 04:01:27
I don't follow any one on youtube at the moment.  I feel like if i did i would have already droped a hint or two.  Its not a bad idea i just feel like if you understand bitcoin and follow a guy/girl on youtube you would have already done this.

If this is your way to spread bitcoin, well I do t care. 
@_date: 2014-07-16 09:43:54
Bitcoin wont be around by then.  Dont get me wrong.  Bitcoin will be around for a very long time if you ask me.  But by the year 2140 something better will take its place.  I think something better will happen more like 20 years away. 
@_date: 2014-12-07 07:19:47
No i meant it.

@_date: 2014-07-15 21:38:26
Well what i think hes trying to say is if someone were to develop an algorithm (with no central authority) that can increase or decrease the amount of bitcoin coming out according to real life problems, that this could stabilize bitcoin and we can use it as a unit of exchange and would remain a store of value.       
@_date: 2014-05-04 05:06:58
you pussies?  God i hate you.

@_date: 2014-08-23 08:42:35

Are you this guy?
@_date: 2014-12-27 04:39:14
yeah just like the internet bowl in 2006.  
@_date: 2014-05-17 08:50:57
I think it's estimaded only 5-10 million people in the world owne any part of a bitcoin. Feel like there is room for a lot of growth still. 
@_date: 2014-05-04 06:59:36
I dont like you.
@_date: 2014-10-25 22:43:22
Address? 
@_date: 2014-08-31 21:03:42
That may be true for a little bit but long term that won't last. I'm not worried about mainstream adoption happening as soon as possible. Mainstream adoption will come when the time is right. Bitcoin the best version of money ever created. People will come to it once there current use of money renders useless/worthless. 
@_date: 2014-10-16 02:42:10
yeah sorry about that, thanks. 
@_date: 2014-07-09 07:13:01
Yeah i hate you more.

I wish you would go more indeapth about the Headlines you speak of.  I feel like ive read all the same headlines but i not so much what was in them.  I mean for the most part you just read the headline right? 
@_date: 2014-11-29 23:20:21

@_date: 2014-09-13 07:20:57
such a dumb question. 
@_date: 2014-04-22 20:23:31
Wow, kinda surprised about how heart felt that was.  That was awesome.
 
@_date: 2014-08-19 22:54:28
I'll just buy half a bitcoin ;)

The only way Peter Schiff is able to buy more gold is because he has a business that makes profit so he can pay for his house, car, faimly and MORE GOLD!  Im not a fan boy of Petter Schiff but this was just dumb.
@_date: 2014-07-01 08:35:36

Well i guess its about damn time i set up a ChangeTip account!  Lay it on me brother/sister!
@_date: 2014-06-16 20:54:12
Let me tip others with bits of yours!!!
@_date: 2014-07-04 08:07:31
I would love to see that trust me!  I feel ideas like some sort of international collaboration of "major assets coins" will be orchestrated out of necessity with most major countrys.  This i feel will be where we lose that trillion or even million dollar value.
@_date: 2015-05-16 02:05:49
You invited me.  I really want to go but i'm not sure i want to go alone.  I've got two other bitcoin friends lets see if i can talk them into it.  
@_date: 2014-08-20 21:31:52
Im pretty sure its illegal to not accept dollars.  You have the right to refuse service but if someone feels that the were denied service because the had USD you might get sued/fined.  Just look into is all i'm saying.  
@_date: 2014-06-28 06:32:17
I own all bitcoin, this is dumb.
@_date: 2014-09-02 22:56:05
For bitcoin to remain a "collectible" people would still have to mine bitcoin.  Who would mine bitcoin for a collectible?  There is no possible scenario where bitcoin is a collectible.  It will either become a globle currency or nothing.

I agree tits are nasty!

Waited for a long time!
@_date: 2015-05-12 09:57:45
Did and loved it!
@_date: 2015-05-14 07:16:36
This is very true.  In 2012 i freaked the fuck out about bitcoin and had nothing else in the world to talk about.  People didnt like me at that point.  Ive got all my old friends back but i promise you it doesnt work.  Some day they will come to you with questions and as Introshine suggested, keep it short.  If they are way into it then by all means freak with your new best friend ;) 
@_date: 2015-01-30 10:21:13
Are you a terrorist?
@_date: 2015-01-09 01:56:04
Not looking good?  Am I missing something?  So some CENTRALIZED exchanges loose Bitcoin and the experiment doesn't look good. Of course this stuff was going to happen and let's get it out of the way now.
@_date: 2015-01-10 23:44:49
@_date: 2015-01-06 09:32:55
I didnt think that.  But now i think that. 
@_date: 2015-01-21 12:42:59
I live in provo. Hit me up any time. 
@_date: 2015-01-09 02:26:16
Maybe not the best place to ask but anyone know if someone is working on a prediction market? I headed something about it this summer on lets talk Bitcoin but nothing since. 
@_date: 2014-07-09 07:19:43
Youre right, sorry.

@_date: 2016-01-26 08:24:43
Most of the people that do it are trolls like yourself that have agendas for another coin then make comments in here.  Nice try.  
@_date: 2014-11-16 22:28:36
Who the hell is saying that would happen in October and why the hell do you want this to happen?

"Can the company recover from this?  Only time will tell."  haha oh god.  Dont report on something you dont understand anything about.  
@_date: 2014-06-27 19:16:11
Thank you.
@_date: 2016-01-27 09:23:51
This sounds like the "bitcoin was at this point one time, then it droped.  Then bitcoin hit this point at one time and then it droped." guy. 
@_date: 2014-09-24 21:09:37
So I have the Bitcoin I chose to save and the Bitcoin I chose to spend.  Each pay check I out $100 worth of Bitcoin on my blockchain wallet and use that to play. As for my savings I lock that away and won't touch it for ten years. 
@_date: 2016-01-26 08:28:34
WOW!  That tip was HUGE!  Thanks man! 
@_date: 2016-01-25 09:10:11

Some or all? 
@_date: 2017-08-17 19:14:15
@_date: 2017-01-19 07:18:18
 I think the point is being missed here. Yeah dont buy youre hardware wallet from a second hand vendor.  Youre btc is worth to much to be trusted. 
@_date: 2017-01-01 23:54:44
yes is it yours?
@_date: 2016-11-30 06:11:21
What a wonderful double entendre. 
@_date: 2017-08-30 10:34:39
No way dude, a digital house is the same as a digital money!  DUH!

@_date: 2015-07-24 06:37:10
This is really how you think it's going to work out?  Block size is an issue but there are many to come. This is a good test case. If you think this is drama you just wait. 
@_date: 2015-08-08 18:33:28
I sure it's a dude in the whail club. Love them all.

Very well done *applause* *applause* *applause* Thanks again for the doc.!
@_date: 2015-07-29 04:11:41
As far as an investment, bitcoin is long term.  If you are able to keep your $1,500 Euro lock into an investment for 5-10 years.  I like almost every one in r/bitcoin think the price will be worth more than it is now.  I would not put money in bitcoin if you're going to need the money back with in the next year or two.  Just not work the risk IMO.
@_date: 2015-07-27 23:11:29
I read it. 
@_date: 2015-07-29 19:27:46
What are you talking about?  What does that even mean? 
@_date: 2015-08-29 17:31:45
@_date: 2015-07-14 23:13:51
I just watched and feel its very well done. For new comers this is awesome.  Im still waiting for a doc. that will talk more about the possibilities of the protocol and what other possibilities will come.  Im an ass hole that has been in bitcoin way to long, so maybe im just being a dick.  Very well done just wanted a little more.  None the less i was very happy to pay for this doc.  If youre new to bitcoin its an awesome watch!
@_date: 2015-07-18 00:52:46
Love this, i was going to do this in my man cave at some point.  Love to see good ideas being put to use.
@_date: 2015-07-29 04:16:52
Im sorry but that hat looks photoshopped as hell.  
@_date: 2015-07-14 23:26:20
I agree.  I watched and the narrator just seemed to thick if that makes sense.

@_date: 2015-03-08 04:05:13
@_date: 2015-03-13 20:19:45
I care about bitcoin SO much!  I really do though. 
@_date: 2015-02-07 22:45:42
I kinda feel creepy for watching this.
@_date: 2015-02-19 08:24:09
Coinmarket, i was about to puntch you in the ear!
@_date: 2015-03-20 19:27:55
No the merchant is liable for a charge back.  They lose out on the money.  Thus making bitcoin more atrative to merchants.  
@_date: 2015-02-10 05:19:55
I had no idea bitcoin was in Inida!  That is awesome.

@_date: 2015-02-07 08:11:03
Thanks for posting your comment.  Most of this i knew already but i was hoping that there could be some can of transition into the blockchain that would be possible for him.  You're right, if he wants to survive hes gotta take it to another level.  I dont see that happening.  Thanks for taking the time to write this.   
@_date: 2015-02-22 22:32:21
Well right now i have .08 of bitcoin in btc-flow.com  I can log in and am unable to withdraw my coins.  No site is a scam as i knew it was.  
@_date: 2015-02-07 05:55:24
This really may be the best way for him to pissition himself with how disruptive the blockchain is twards his company.  Im going to suggest this for sure.  Thank you.  
@_date: 2015-02-05 04:09:16
dollar*/cost is going well.  Around $88 a coin.  
@_date: 2015-02-18 20:38:01
Way to be a dick about it. 
@_date: 2017-07-27 18:32:32
Is it safe to be able to access you bitcoin from your phone wallet to your Trezor?  I feel like that seems very unsafe.  If someone were to rob you in the middle of the night and demand you empty your full bank account right then and their... yikes! 
@_date: 2015-03-23 01:41:38
You're a cool guy.
Don't tip me please.  
@_date: 2017-07-28 04:31:31
I don't think most people could get robbed and loose all there life savings. If you phone can connect to your wallet wouldn't there be risk everything in "your bank" could get taken in just one min. That fast. I don't know. That idea scares me. 
@_date: 2015-03-18 10:30:34
Could be the 43k Bitcoin stollen from the dark et site. Or could just be people shorting because they know it's possible they might sell at some point. 
@_date: 2015-02-28 10:34:42
I dont know what to say.  Somone should say it!
@_date: 2015-02-27 10:33:32
Sidechains could be used for this. 
@_date: 2015-03-03 19:10:13
As a Provo dude, this makes me very happy!
@_date: 2015-02-14 09:31:57
Fyrstikken I love you so much.  You make me laugh all day in the Whale club!  Keep being you man.  Thanks. 
@_date: 2015-02-25 09:54:48
I want it to collect things from this time.  Phyiscal things  you can hold from this time will be wroth things later is the way i look at it.  
@_date: 2015-02-25 10:11:11
ill take both.
@_date: 2015-02-23 21:32:24
How do you register ill chip in i just want a chance!!!
@_date: 2017-05-11 16:39:43
I feel like you're new. mBTC will come about  naturally. Not by some random dumb post from someone who got into Bitcoin two years ago. This comes up every time there is a spike. I think you just want karma to be honest because this is not an  original idea. 
@_date: 2015-11-11 19:55:36
Fuck that. I tell people to buy one and expect to hodl for at lest 8 years. I mean if you care about these people and really understand Bitcoin and the potential it has. I feel it's mad not to suggest buying at least one.  Unless at this price it's something they can't aford. Duh! 
@_date: 2015-02-25 09:03:48
ill buy it.  What do you want for it?
@_date: 2015-02-25 20:46:35
@_date: 2015-02-28 06:13:30
I dont mind him but and what he says to be honest.  I just want to know why he hangs out at chucky cheese and drink bud lite.  
Edit: sorry drunk.
