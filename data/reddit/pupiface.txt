In big, bold, underlined capital letters “What they must do is to” complicated. “Too”, not “to”. The idea behind it is kinda cool, though it needs more Engrish points.

Even if he get sued again, court proceedings would likely take years to wrap up. Mark will only get his hands on the remainder of the Bitcoin after all cases against him have been settled. And if/when he does, he would not be dumb enough to sell it on exchanges as opposed to OTC. (He advised the lawyer not to sell the $400m on exchanges, but to auction it off, to no avail). IMO I really don’t see MtGox coins being put up for sale again any time soon. For the short-mid term, I’d say there are more pressing matters to worry about.

Because they were idiots and failed to see there was no underlying solid foundation behind beanie babies. They are not divisible, transferrable to the other side of the globe within minutes, and served absolutely no purpose. Now you’re comparing a collectible item to a whole asset class with solid foundations that just broke ground as the next high-impact innovation after the Internet. 
You seem perfectly capable of distinguishing patterns, with a knack for making the wrong comparisons. If you are genuinely lost and need some guidance, do yourself a favour and do some research on the topic. On youtube alone there are countless videos illustrating the ludicrousness of the very same comparisons you have made so far. It may sound blunt, but you are not contributing to the discussion by making posts based off sheer ignorance of the topic at hand.

Just Bitcoin really. It’s the only coin I invested in. A whole 0.2 of it. I like to hear informed opinions and technical talk about it though, and not so much sifting through garbage posts. The technology behind it and its state of affairs are what really interest me.

The trustee has already sold all he had to sell in order to cover the settlement and theoretically no more selling should be done by him. If all proceeds normally, the remaining 160k bitcoin should soon be at the hands of Mark Karpeles, the main guy behind the now-defunct MtGox. He = Mark, not the idiotic court-appointed trustee.

Oh, yeah, its mGox right (I think thats how you spell it). Apparently they have tons more to sell so my noob instincts tell me that bitcoin will continue to move sideways for the next few months. I read in a post that they are selling off in batches and wait for it to recover, the last one being on the 28th, with an expected one on March 6th based off their selling pattern. Turns out they weren’t too far off. /cries

They were able to recover roughly 200k bitcoin, and still have 160 thousand. The 40k bitcoin they have sold so far coincides with the $395M that they owed as part of their bankruptcy settlement.  Japanese law states that the “leftover” bitcoin after paying the settlement should go back to Tibanne, which is MtGox’s former parent company, 100% owned by a single individual named Mark Karpeles. Do a google search on his name along with the term “money laundering” and you’ll get a rough idea of whose hands the remaining 160k bitcoins will fall into. 
Not all is set is stone though, as the court case in Japan could linger for years before the 160k bitcoins can reach its final destination. If it all goes by the book, we have no way of knowing what Mark would do with such a huge stash, though given his past record of unethical practices, it’s hard to be optimistic about being held hostage by a single individual with the power to crash the price of bitcoin much worse than it has already been MtGox’d in the past.

BTC is a continuous bubble that has popped numerous times. It has been this way since the beginning. No one has given a definitive value to it as it is still in its infancy and subject to both internal, technical factors as well as external factors such as government regulation, for example, which serves as a world-wide preparation for a more secure mass adoption. And yes, its price is indeed speculative for the most part, though we cannot forget about whales and market manipulators. Their decisions are 100% premeditated and often times not a result of speculation, but rather self-gain at the expense of others, regardless of price.
@_date: 2018-03-09 07:50:01
You cannot compare a company that went bankrupt to an emerging technology of a different asset class. This cycle has repeated itself countless times every time a a new breakthrough technology reached the mainstream. All the way from railroads to Internet bubble of the 2000s. If looking at the past for a pointer of future events is your thing, then by all means, do make a comparison that stands its ground.
Bitcoin is intrinsically highly volatile and still in its early infancy. Not to mention it belongs to a completely different asset class, ALL of which  experienced similar drops in the past couple of days. Apologies if you were being sarcastic, as it’s cringing to read someone making a comparison between Bitcoin (or any other crypto for that matter) and Enron shares. You cannot compare a corrupt, mature, centralized apple to an an entire asset class of unripe decentralized oranges.

AFAIK there are huge sell walls awaiting if it dips to the low 8000s, leading to a free fall with no support until ~$5200. Fragile situation. At this point it’s anybody’s guess what’ll come next. I’m staying away from both buying and selling for now. Some good news needs to come out to bring back relative stability and growth IMO, as the past few months have been pestered with FUD, uncertainty over regulations, MtGox, Binance, Japanese exchange crackdowns, ad infinitum. I think a lot of this was caused by over-speculation, fear, panic selling, and people moving their cryptos OTC until the dust settles. There’s no indication of this particular dip having any connection with MtGox, at least.
@_date: 2018-03-08 04:05:51
There’s no doubt he will try to milk as much as he can off their stash for himself. AFAIK he’s selling bitcoin as a settlement due to the mtGox hack. I figure he can’t exactly keep it all to himself, so he’s likely trying to use this as a tool to undermine bitcoin, no pun intended.

Shareholders? Mark owns 100% of the now-defunct MtGox’s parent company. He is the sole individual it would go to.
Edit: Apologies, I stand corrected - Jeb McCaleb owns a 12% stake in MtGox. 
"If ultimately I do end up netting money from Mt. Gox, I'll try to figure out a way to give it to the Mt. Gox creditors," Jed McCaleb, who still holds his 12-percent stake, e-mailed Ars. "If that isn't possible, at least [I'll donate] to something that benefits the Bitcoin ecosystem."

Weekends have notoriously been low on volume compared to week days, especially since entering the bear market. Our current volume levels we see during the week are already very low, which contributes to even lower weekend volume.

One reasonable point to consider is monetary devaluation, as noted in the article. A potential mass selloff of US treasury notes held by foreign nations ( as the dollar loses its value due to decreased global trading in USD denominations. China’s petro-yuan is a good example. The forecast for a public debt spiraling out if control doesn’t help the dollar’s credibility either. I’m not trying to spread FUD nor be a source of fear-mongering. These issues are genuinely concerning and you can read about foreign governments creating and investing in hedges against the USD on a daily basis (stockpiling gold reserves, investing in blockchain technology and avoiding trade in USD). I think more people should be aware of these issues. Even if none of the above ends up materializing, it’s still a valid concern.

You can find multiple sources on Kobayashi’s comment about it on Google, which the original would likely be in Japanese and I wouldn’t know where to find. Here’s one of the stories reverberating his words:

To those of you who are worried about today’s dip, let’s put things into perspective. In November 2017, when prices were still around 10-11k, this is what we saw between Nov 28 and Dec 2.
The price fluctuated between 11.2k and 9.5k in a matter of a few days. It fully recovered and resumed its ascent.
This general pattern repeated itself several times during the bull run up to 20k. If you are trading, sure, take advantage of the dip, but to anyone thinking this is Mayday, try to put things into perspective, and realize that we can’t go up daily ad infinitum. Price corrections are healthy and necessary. The market needs to breathe. Don’t panic (unless  you’re in super high leverage with no cover :)

Great effort, though I suggest revising your content before publishing it. Multiple grammar/spelling mistakes within the first 15 seconds of reading the article.

This is the wrong subreddit to ask. Do a bit of research about and you’ll understand why. I would tell you, but my message would likely be deleted.
