Miners don’t control anything other than securing the network (as it was designed to be)
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:55:23
Most proof of work isn’t the longest chain- BCH has a longer chain than BTC, but btc has more proof of work. That is, most proof of work is the sum of all work done on the chain. So if you lower the difficulty, you’ll mine a longer chain but you’ll have to do vastly less work to do so. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 04:35:40
Satoshi actually talked about increasing the block size 
There hasn't been any proof yet that increasing the block size to 2MB or even 8MB will cause centralization. 
If you don't see how segwit and LN will cause centralization, I won't be able to continue. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 18:15:11
Honestly they both are bad. Most at r/btc want bitcoin to scale on-chain, that’s it. They don’t have anything against btc other than the outright refusal to increase the blocksize to even 2mb. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 18:22:22
A lot of people want bitcoin to scale on-chain (they want a blocksize increase). Time and again this has failed, so some people forked and created bitcoin cash which at this point is just bitcoin with a larger blocksize.

Bitcoin was always meant to scale on chain. If you’re hinting that a blocksize increase is incompatible to 4 years ago you’d be right, but that’s not what makes bitcoin “bitcoin”

Except bitcoin fees are out of control (and have been for awhile), and there’s no reason why Segwit2x should have stopped short of a blocksize increase. LN might be helpful in the future but *right now* something needs to be done

I have 2 coinbase accounts, first one has bank account linked and a small balance, &lt;0.5% with no 2FA, API enabled. I spend btc from this account. 
The other one is locked down pretty tight, and I keep ~10% there. No bank account linked, and I send money frequently here from the first account. If I want to sell some, I just send them back

@_date: 2014-04-12 00:47:09
it looks like you are only familiar with economies that exist under inflationary conditions. 
economies with deflationary currencies (will) behave differently. 
if bitcoin had no cap, then the 3600 new btc would not be creating anything, since each new btc would slightly devalue every btc already in existence (like what is happening with say, dollars). since there's a cap, adding more btc does not devalue those already in existence. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 00:02:57

2) do you get a bulk discount when buying your PSU's?

Same here – I was a customer when they were ING and was also disappointed with the buyout, but things have been okay since the buyout (i've stayed on the fence, but since the transition went relatively smoothly and nothing seemed to change much I was willing to stay). 
I have bought BTC with coinbase about a year ago and there were no issues at all. I'm not sure what structuring is, care to explain?
@_date: 2015-01-21 15:08:37
About a year ago I bought a little. Just recently (past week) I've been buying a good bit more. 
I called and they were incredibly shady which is so out of character for them. Their customer service has been stellar up to this point (friendly, quick, etc). 
As I said, I bought some about a year ago, so I wouldn't be too worried with existing accounts unless you increase your buy volume. 
@_date: 2015-01-21 15:05:38

I always recommended them too. No issues at all. 
In the past week I had at least 6 transactions to circle/coinbase

about $400 for each transaction, about $1500 total
@_date: 2015-01-21 18:31:26
I wish there was more to the story. This morning I received several withdraw notification emails, and after logging in, noticed all my savings accounts had been closed and the money is on it's way to a linked account. 
As I said before, I used to buy bitcoin regularly about a year ago with absolutely no issue. I always thought CO360 was one of the "safe" banks, after reading so many stories of accounts being closed. 
@_date: 2015-01-21 20:41:53

@_date: 2015-01-21 18:34:31
Simple.com is actually amazing - they are (were) one of the linked accounts and I love love the interface and features. The only problem is their limits. I use them for monthly budgeting and small transactions, but for larger transactions they get in the way.

This wasn't meant to be a comparison to BTC directly, but rather - anything can and will have extreme highs and lows. back when the nasdaq hit its low, no one was crying the end of the stock market. everyone just knew it was a sucky time to be involved. 
edit: the chart was pulled from this article 
@_date: 2015-01-22 02:37:11
coinbase/circle were linked to my checking account, not my savings. I am very aware of the 6 withdraw limit and haven't breached it. 
I agree it probably has to do with regulations they are forced to follow, and I doubt structuring had anything to do with it, as total btc withdraws were $1500 - nowhere near any limit (coinbase says their limit is $3000, most banks is $10,000)
@_date: 2015-01-23 19:29:10
I already have an account but it's not letting me access these credits. how would I do that?
@_date: 2015-01-21 18:50:08
I've been with ING about 2 years prior to the CO360 buyout
 &lt;10% btc related
I won't give details but at least 5 figures balance
i can access my checking account only (I also had 5 savings accounts), because there is a pending payment going out. once that payment goes out they said the remaining balance will be transferred and the checking account closed. 
No warning at all. I started receiving a bunch of emails this morning notifying me of withdraws. I immediately called, and they had already closed all my savings accounts and initiated a transfer to a linked account. 
no other trading activity at all. I don't use the account for much (it's not my main bank account) - just mortgage payments, and larger payments for home improvement etc.

A few follow up questions - 
1)  do you have a list of areas you were looking at that have (had) cheap power (feel free to exclude your own location)? I'm seriously starting to consider moving my operation.
2) what are you waiting for to buy back in? a certain price point? 
3) do you have a set price at miningrigrentals.com or do you try to follow the going rate? 
Thanks again. I've been waiting for the chance to pick the brain of someone in my shoes. 
@_date: 2015-01-21 18:37:00
I had multiple savings accounts opened (rudimentary budgeting) but no - all bitcoin transactions came out of the **checking** account. I am very aware of the 6 withdraw limit and CO360 was really good at informing me when I approached that limit (they would notify at 4 or 5 withdraws to make sure I don't go over). But again - all coinbase/circle withdraws happened from the checking account. 
@_date: 2015-01-27 15:59:57

I currently have about 30TH, and I pay about $0.13 for electricity. Crazy expensive compared to your $0.04, but does your $0.04 include delivery/transmission charges? ie is that your total electric cost? 
2) are you under-clocking any units to achieve better efficiency? 35kw for 50TH seems very efficient. I'm using about 28kw for my 30TH and I'm running everything stock (all 28 and 20nm). 
3) who do you rent to? I've heard renting is pretty profitable, as there are lots of people willing to buy hashing power at inflated prices. I'm interested in this, and would love to hear from someone doing it first hand. 
4) with btc prices so low, do you hold any btc on the assumption the price will go up?
5) what percent of your mining operation is your overall net worth? ie did you go all in, and took a risky bet, or is this just "chump change" and wouldn't really matter if btc dropped to say, $40 next week (i'm pretty sure your operation would not be profitable at this price given the current difficulty). 
6) when looking for a place to run your equipment, was distance from your residence a consideration, or did you not care how far they were as long as you had cheap power?
Thanks a bunch, I love reading about fellow "mid sized" miners and how they run their operation. 
Edit: one more question (follow up to 6)
If things stay as is (difficulty and btc price at current levels) I'll have to find cheaper power. What was your approach? Did you know someone with cheap space in an area with cheap power, or did you start looking at local listings? Thanks again. 
@_date: 2015-01-21 22:26:39

@_date: 2015-01-21 20:20:35
no gambling-related transitions. besides mortgage payments and some home improvement payments, there really weren't any transaction besides the coinbase/circle stuff (p2p payments every now and again or a check being mailed, but that's normal)
@_date: 2015-01-21 15:47:19
In the past week I have bought btc, usually 2 at a time, so the withdraws appeared at ~$400 each about every day. But even if I lumped them together it would only total about $1500.

And blockstream isn't an attempt at corporate takeover? Cmon 
@_date: 2017-08-19 19:55:04
Except core agreed (multiple times) to increase the block size, and backed out every time. "Their efforts" are laughable- segwit is not a capacity increase. It fixes other problems but it is not designed for scaling. It does offer marginal increase, but there are quicker and easier ways to achieve on chain scaling. 
@_date: 2017-08-21 11:27:14
If "the couple of guys" didn't represent anything significant why did the miners all agree to it?
@_date: 2017-08-20 12:04:43
Segwit provides immediate 1.7x increase, which is only kicking the can down the road until they get around to implementing LN which could be another year from now. Segwit was designed to address malleability and quadratic hashing (I think), and eventually support LN (the true scaling solution). Bitcoin needs a blocksize increase AND LN-like features (if not LN itself) but core is adamant against block size increase. 
By the way, back in 2014/2015 Core did agree to increase the blocksize via the Hong Kong agreement (and another one, can't remember the name). They backed out both times. 
@_date: 2017-08-19 17:37:46
The only meaningful improvement (the most pressing issue) is scalability and btc has failed at scaling 
@_date: 2017-08-19 15:59:36
How else do you fire Core and get bigger blocks if not via a hard fork? It's stagnated for years, nothing was changing 
@_date: 2017-08-20 12:09:00
A block size increase could have been activated years ago. No reason to withhold that. You can have a block size increase and segwit 
@_date: 2017-11-11 22:26:06
What about BTC being “centrally controlled” by Core? Honestly, Greg/Adam/Luke come across as very incompetent (not to mention they are fully under the control of BS).

good point. if BTC stayed above say $500 I bet they'd keep everything in house. Now I'm sure we'll see sales to hobbyists. 
FWIW, at kncminer.com it says "due to a rapidly shifting landscape within the mining industry we're not able to announce single hardware products in the Solar range for online purchasing just yet."
this makes it sound like they will eventually sell hardware, but leaves them enough wiggle room to back out if they want.

What is the quickest/easiest way to tell if I am running a full node? I have the bitcoin software running on my machine, but I heard it's still possible to not contribute even then?

This guy ordered hit men....why are we defending him?
@_date: 2015-02-22 03:44:33
Not just fees. The banks listed either have minimum balance requirements, an unsavory past, or small limits on daily weekly monthly amounts you can transfer. 
@_date: 2015-02-08 04:14:51
I am looking into it. as i understand it, LBC charges a fee? I'll have to read up on it more

Coinbase has my address on file and allowed me to link the bank account. 
@_date: 2015-02-21 21:13:26
It's in my post history but basically -
I was a customer since ING
Used my account some with coinbase when they first launched
Used it again recently, in larger amounts (due to the price drop), next thing I know (no warning or heads up) my accounts are closed and the money is transferred to a linked account.

What are the current theoretical "dangers" as a relates to privacy? what can be improved upon in the future, and what risks (no matter how small) and I taking now?
This is a learning curve for me I appreciate your input
@_date: 2015-02-10 01:18:36
what is their natural limit?

You're doing the lords work 37421.95 bits

It's a local bank and would probably reveal my location

I stopped using coinbase as a wallet, but for buying/selling they are still one of the best options with least friction. 
I used to hate on coinbase, but have since come to realize they are essentially being forced (via regulation) into treating bitcoin like fiat. 
I think if coinbase went under tomorrow, it would be a much bigger blow to the bitcoin community than them limping along like they are now. Noobs need coinbase/circle, if wider adoption is to occur. 
@_date: 2015-02-22 19:26:05
This should get you past $10, but you should still go through the process of circle or coinbase just to gain experience. Have fun! $5
@_date: 2015-02-24 04:12:17
Yeah it was smooth sailing for about a year then out of the blue, accounts closed. 
@_date: 2015-02-08 04:18:49
Now that I think about it, they might send money from a compromised account. 
@_date: 2015-02-21 21:51:53
you can double check my post, but there were 3 transactions, ~$1600 total. 
@_date: 2015-02-24 15:09:42
They said they were sorry to see me go but couldn't change their policy at this time 
@_date: 2015-02-20 22:22:00
this might be the wrong place to ask, but can someone give a brief comparison - bread wallet, mycelium, blockchain wallet, hive? 
these 4 seem very similar in function.

I started reading your commedbrwkd swdju ssj cnsl dldkhebedjjko 
@_date: 2015-02-24 15:14:24
I did ask them why they don't care about cash withdraws and they said depending on the amount and frequency, they would start asking questions.

can you explain further on starting BC with disablewallet=1 flag?
(I'm running this on a mac, btw).

Yes I think she was meaning digital currency (which I'm fine with) but virtual currency rubs me the wrong way

Unless banks try to fight, via lobbying etc. then it's definitely "war"
@_date: 2015-02-08 04:11:35
did you read this somewhere?
@_date: 2015-02-21 03:21:19
this is helpful, thanks. What's the pro/con to implementing SPV? why don't the others do it?
Also, if say, the hive server were to go down, would the app still be functioning? or would your balance be trapped until their servers came back?
@_date: 2015-02-21 21:08:57
No they aren't (yet)
@_date: 2015-02-24 18:15:05
Do they have a decent app?
@_date: 2015-02-10 01:51:19
That doesn't make it any better. 
@_date: 2015-02-22 01:10:58
Tempting, but they were formerly GMAC, one of the big bailouts. I won't take my business there. 
@_date: 2015-02-24 15:07:32
I'm sure they wouldn't let me buy Silk Road gift cards 
@_date: 2015-02-22 01:15:04
 I actually looked and it is surprisingly hard to find an online bank with no fees and a well-functioning mobile app. Chase is the closest i found, but I'm hesitant to join a big bank. 
All the ones you listed have issues 
@_date: 2015-02-09 15:57:32
I'm 90% sure coinbase requires 6 confirmations, so nothing out of the ordinary here
edit: looks like 3 confirmations for reputable accounts, 6 confirmations for new ones? 
@_date: 2015-02-21 18:17:33
Can you comment on this other comment?
"SPV with certain Bloom filter implementations are not so private.
With a private server you are trusting a known entity with your privacy and communicating over an encrypted channel. With SPV you are trusting your privacy to an unknown and communicating in the clear.
You are also depending on port 8333 being open on the wi-fi network you are on, and also that someone isn't MIM-ing this.
Connecting to a private server is instant, SPV clients need to sync headers with the blockchain."
Specifically what is the danger if there was a MIM?

My refund came directly from the airline (not cheapair) and it went back to my CC (in dollars obviously) 
@_date: 2015-02-03 16:02:59
I disagree. I think they have moved from "stellar company" to "untrustworthy" company. They have shipped all my rigs on time (other than my bonus Neptunes, which is laughable, but was not part of the agreement at time of purchase). 
I won't be buying from them again, but my past experience as been great (even warranty repairs etc). 
@_date: 2015-02-11 21:24:12
I think you're missing my original point, it would be very difficult once widespread adoption occurred. When there are hundreds of thousands of businesses, tracking every earning report would be near-impossible. Even fake-purchasing doesn't show much, as those BTC can be watched as they move around the block chain, but in no relation to any other transaction, it won't reveal any helpful info. 
@_date: 2015-02-03 16:04:34
KNC told everyone who bought a batch 1 Neptune (about a year ago) that they would receive a bonus Neptune no later than August 2014. Supposedly they JUST started shipping the bonus miners. I'm still waiting for mine.

why is this being down voted?
@_date: 2015-02-23 22:32:31
I talked to the bank today, and they told me a lady from coinbase had already contacted them, "a few months ago" but their decision "remain unchanged". I'd love for you to reach out again but it sounds like a waste of time. 
@_date: 2015-02-24 04:17:31
Yeah but they don't ask questions when I withdraw a bunch of cash 
@_date: 2015-02-08 04:16:50
I could send a blockchain ID, but i'm not sure how that proves it was from KNC. 
besides, it was to my coinbase account, which coinbase says they "combine" anyway, so receiving addresses often don't retain their value. 
that said, i'd be happy to provide a transaction ID if there was somehow to prove it came from KNC. 
edit: are you asking for proof because you don't believe KNC refunded people? there are plenty of people (you can browse their forums) who got refunds. KNC took their sweet time in doing it but a lot of people (all?) did get their refunds. 
@_date: 2015-02-22 13:02:39
Wow thanks. I will be visiting the bank on Monday, depending on how it goes, I will reach out to you. Thanks again. 
@_date: 2015-02-16 04:13:07
Under the rules of the old system everything works like you said. 
Bitcoin can fit into the old system, and does in some cases, but it also works outside the system we have built. 
@_date: 2015-02-03 16:08:46
3) they delivered on time for me and a lot of others. Some people may have had late shipments. 
4) I bought a neptune for 10 BTC (december 2013), later requested a refund in BTC and was refunded 20BTC (it was about $500/btc at the time of refund). maybe I got lucky but their refund system certainly worked. 
@_date: 2015-02-24 15:11:04
Yeah if anything it should be Coinbase taking this position but as their business is built around it, obviously conflicts. 
@_date: 2015-02-24 15:11:51
And any account links with digital currency companies gets the letter
@_date: 2015-02-24 18:13:56
They could (if they wanted) put a hold on your ability to withdraw from an atm

The letter was signed by the branch manager with her number. I will be calling her on Monday 
@_date: 2015-02-03 16:05:33
they did say their new 16nm miner would go on sale later this year, but did not give a date. 
@_date: 2015-02-10 01:48:46
most bitcoin-paying jobs right now are basically cash- untraceable. And if corporations' revenue is BTC, it will be hard to track that as well (depending fully on their honesty in reporting income etc). 
sales tax is the easiest to charge, beyond that, it will get very messy. 
But to my original point, "tax free accounts" shouldn't be a crime IMO. 
@_date: 2015-02-21 22:36:11
(my first tip, let's see if I did this right)
@_date: 2015-02-09 15:51:32
"tax free accounts" is their crime? if/when bitcoin becomes mainstream, it will be hard to tax (beyond sales tax). 
@_date: 2015-02-08 04:13:34
it was because of the price drop. I bought the miner when it was $1000/btc, requested a refund (because they hadn't shipped yet) when it was $500/btc. KNC does USD refunds, so I got the same in USD back, but twice as many BTC. 
I didn't actually make money on the refund, but I certainly made a lot more BTC than I would have with the miners. 
@_date: 2015-02-24 15:17:35
Thanks. I have other issues with BoA (their business practices) but I'm glad to hear they are bitcoin friendly 
@_date: 2015-02-24 15:12:54
Eh there are plenty of banks out there (so far..) there's nothing keeping me with them I'm just as happy moving on.
