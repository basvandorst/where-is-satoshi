I also met a girl some days ago (21) and she never heard about crypto or Bitcoin. Common after 2017 she didn't realize it xD
@_date: 2019-07-21 08:36:46
I will show this some friends to test there IQ let's see what the results will be xD
@_date: 2019-07-13 14:12:11
What are you talking.
...even use encryption... Noone really? xD
@_date: 2019-07-19 21:22:44
Let them think what they want dude.
I had a discussion once with my aunt, she works at a bank xD
Quite funny she had some basic knowledge about BTC but in the end she just said stuff they told here at the bank.
Forget it. Don't push people somewhere they have no understanding. Give them time and if you really want to win this conversation, you have to win and destroy every problem they see with BTC if you can't evolve yourself in this field.
But easiest way just wait a couple of years in the end they will see it by themselves
@_date: 2019-07-23 10:13:03
And you sound like an asshole.
There are things in life you just think about them
@_date: 2019-07-08 03:51:52
Better she goes back to make up ����
Man I like her she's cool
@_date: 2019-07-22 20:35:09
Haha nice one ��

It says 87 xD

What the fuck are you talking bro.
Stupid as fuck really ��

Looks like only fuckers here.
But thanks man

Where exactly I'm in Tokyo right now.
Would be worth to see this in real life ��
@_date: 2018-09-14 06:14:39
Haha omg this is so good! ��
@_date: 2018-09-17 14:24:12
If u need in couple of month, definitly wait til december or invest in another coin and make some trades (more Work).
And BTC won't take another 10 years. Please read up what happens right now with big companies and what they planing to do.
Move over ETFs, Bakkt has a bigger Bitcoin story
 
Thats just some examples.
And wait for DEX next big boom
@_date: 2018-09-15 04:55:02
Really good article short and in the point
@_date: 2018-09-18 08:02:53

Explain yourself why ETH is a scam please?
@_date: 2018-09-13 14:38:06
U guys are morons
@_date: 2019-03-06 10:24:11
Totally agree but - that's a good improvement and beginning. The average Joe is not comfortable with cryptos and most people don't want to understand this, lazy as fuck, so even they don't accept BTC directly, it's a good start
@_date: 2019-03-30 21:08:26
Haha that's so good!
Thx for that!
@_date: 2019-03-21 23:52:39
Talk with people about BTC.
If you know some owners of restaurants, coffeeshops etc. introduce them to cryptos and let them accept it.
If they don't want to hodl there are some ways to instantly convert etc.
@_date: 2019-03-23 15:25:02
Nice move.
Big respect!
@_date: 2019-03-24 10:29:17
Where Is this exactly?
@_date: 2019-03-28 09:43:23
I talk often with my schoolkids about this.  
Money is created out of thin air and the result is the debt increases. Everytime I get the same reaction; ""okay how stupid is that" -and a confused face. Thats the most clear answer for me :D  
Next weak I will let them use there phones to answer some questions about assests, gold, bitcoin and the the global debt :D
@_date: 2019-11-29 23:17:59

My bank deleted my account 2 years ago from one day to the other.
They asked me where I transfered some amount of ��. 
It was a little bit higher but not that much. I told them I invest in cryptos. 2 days later I got a letter that they will close my account. I called them and asked them wtf why?
There answer was the best. We're not obliged to make any statements about it if we suspect something.
Fuck this �� and all of this mother fucking dirty wash trader drug cartel dealers.
Watch the Netflix docu:
Btw the bank was an Austrian one called: Erste Bank und Sparkasse
@_date: 2019-11-08 08:58:22
Jeah I remember that one.
Someone asked him in an interview about this. He answered "I help the people to get rid of there BTC so they can buy real stuff."
@_date: 2019-11-08 08:51:50
Like he said 100k of $.
For that people have to invest with dollars in btc so you can recalculate back how much it would be worth if the dollar would be still alive.
Like every currency. For example when the euro replaced a lot of European currencys they people always calculated what it would be worth in the old currency
@_date: 2019-11-08 23:18:20
Whatever in the end we both know the cost won't last forever and will be replaced
@_date: 2019-11-10 22:24:37
Haha awesome
@_date: 2019-03-19 23:27:17
Don't walk so much dude.
Can't see shit there ��
@_date: 2019-03-09 10:23:59
Yeah only problem if you lose your keys xd
@_date: 2019-11-17 00:51:23
Correct. He puts him in place
@_date: 2019-11-29 06:51:31
I just wanna say &gt;&gt;disbelief phase of the next cycle&lt;&lt; xD
@_date: 2019-11-25 13:15:24
Depends where you send it can also be easy 3% +
@_date: 2019-11-17 00:52:22
Wrong because people know how Peter is in a debate. And this time he got the same shit back
@_date: 2019-11-27 11:04:14
alright thats why the price shoot from 3k to 14k. thanks anyway. maybe u can do it again xD
@_date: 2019-11-08 08:45:56
In the end the dollar will be replaced buy something. It's a currency they always die out
@_date: 2019-11-17 00:50:52
Exactly dude!
That's the point. Peter loves to do this. This time he saw his place and make next time he let people talk.
@_date: 2019-03-22 17:58:32
Sry for you mate.
Thanks anyway to share this story with us!!!
@_date: 2019-11-29 11:36:19
Buy a hardware wallet. The idea is okay but banks sometimes also don't allow to withdraw or take your money back
@_date: 2019-03-18 12:30:34
Then we just simply need a new subject for global economics, fintech, difference between centralized and decentralized systems etc
@_date: 2019-11-29 06:50:31
It's quite cool to see it like that.
But why didn't you stop the charts each by the same date.
@_date: 2019-11-29 11:38:23
Haha she's great. God bless here.
That's pretty cute &lt;3
@_date: 2019-11-29 15:46:55
Because bitcoin can't be greated out of thin air but it brings other problems for the modern world economy xD
@_date: 2019-03-18 00:00:58
The problem start at schools, you don't learn shit about that. Horrible because that's so important
@_date: 2019-11-28 10:12:34
True point.
One question is it not a little bit kyc there because you interact with banks?
Even if they don't know why you send someone money.
@_date: 2018-10-29 08:21:03
Both in Austria.
1. Erste Bank
2. Bank Austria
@_date: 2019-11-13 09:10:09
Long but best way is xmr.to there's also an onion site. 
Send btc receive xmr transfer them to a xmr wallet send it to an exchange where you registered anonymous.
Swap xmr to btc send it where ever you want.
You have to pay some fees especially the last one out of the exchange.
For btc they charge normally 0.0005 btc
@_date: 2019-11-13 16:52:31
In the beginning I was also against that.
But think about the average Joe. As long as he can decide to withdraw his cryptos I'm good with it. Banking can help people in this wild space. Normally the younger generation don't trust banks that much but the boomers do and if we get more of them on the train, even if it's with the help of bank that's good.
When they learn more and trust it they hopefully can withdraw there cryptos, so they have full control
@_date: 2019-11-29 15:25:29
Yeah but at least it's there fault.
@_date: 2019-11-08 09:00:04
Well said dude ��
Plus IBM and Apple didn't get replaced even they was the first for the masses.
@_date: 2019-11-06 21:16:49
Looks like they only get interested big when the price increases xD
@_date: 2019-11-16 09:13:28
Even the beginning is really interesting. Don't want to skip to 19.45 ��

Just dont answer you Invest in cryptos.
After i did that my bank kicked me 1 day later and the same happens to a friend at another bank xD
They pussys and at some point we will get along without them
@_date: 2019-11-08 09:47:49
The first is right the second is dumb.
Mostly used...
@_date: 2019-11-08 08:48:49
I thought the same.
The comment above is stupid.
Only because people create something it doesn't mean it's devalue the other thing, only way if it's better
@_date: 2019-03-19 12:23:40
Depends how much BTC you have ��
@_date: 2019-11-17 00:49:26
Haha omg that's awesome saw a video today from Peter and pomp and Peter was a little bit the same way like kaiser and didn't let him talk after a certain point.
Kaiser is a crazy dude. Love this
@_date: 2018-10-20 14:25:57
Fuck this sucks.
Sry for u mate. Hopefully u make in the future good trades.

@_date: 2019-10-23 08:35:57
Only on Amazon.com avaliable or?
@_date: 2019-10-24 11:47:57
It didn't took 200 billion to move bitcoin from 300$ to 20k$
That was the market cap it doesn't mean you have to pump that amount to move btc that much.
That's completely false. 
We will move again and even higher that's for sure. A lot of tokens will die that's where everyone agrees but there will come definitely another pump dude.
Second there are a ton of people out there that are interested. Why the hell would company's like fidelity, bakkt etc. pump millions of dollars in a product if they don't expect to make money out of  it.
@_date: 2019-10-06 17:06:14
Awesome the well coming is in greek ����
Didn't hear a lot of him talking in his main language
@_date: 2019-10-12 10:29:59
Did anyone used it?
@_date: 2019-08-24 08:01:36
So you have a link for that would like to read that. Sounds interesting
@_date: 2019-10-12 13:52:42
Alright. 
If you want to hold them on a phone I would recommend samurai or coinomi. 
On desktop exodus is pretty nice with good UI. 
The safest way would be a hardware wallet but if you just want to spend 200$ it's not worth. 
On an exchange, like people said it's more risky because you have to trust them. 
With a wallet you have full control but u can still can get hacked. 
Read maybe more about the whole point of btc. 
@_date: 2019-10-24 14:02:33
Depends how much you hold dude.
If I had 10 I would definitely sell some buy. If I had 1 I would sell only 1/3 - 1/2 - 2/3 depends
@_date: 2019-10-24 11:28:37
I trust mathematics and McAfee ��
@_date: 2019-10-24 14:01:11
After his new prediction only if it hits 2 million ����
@_date: 2019-06-08 13:34:03
Bro do the math.
End 2020; 1 million$
@_date: 2019-06-16 22:20:59
Where did you hold them before.
The address you had them before shows when you received the btc and when you send them to the next address. On a exchange you can see it truth the transaction history.
For the address look to a blockchain explorer
@_date: 2019-06-05 10:51:10
Cause somebody else pays a fee.
@_date: 2019-06-23 23:16:07
For what price did you wait? ��
@_date: 2019-06-06 10:44:05
Hey cool thanks for this service. Can you check mine.
@_date: 2019-10-23 08:31:00
Great. Young people learn again some false information in school and when they grow up, it's time to relearn and see the reality xD
Fuck this dude
@_date: 2019-02-03 08:48:59
I don't believe this bullshit.
No way that the biggest company in Canada can be that dumb and have no back up plans if something happens.
I even have back up plans and I don't have much in cryptos. 
Come on that's nonsense
@_date: 2019-06-24 23:15:42
@_date: 2019-06-14 23:47:58
Call then and tell them a wrong seed. Can back after an hour and say it's not solved xxd
@_date: 2019-06-08 09:42:44
It's mathematical impossible it won't go there!
@_date: 2019-06-06 09:32:13
@_date: 2019-06-24 22:46:37
How much is the fee for purchase?
@_date: 2019-06-20 17:10:26
I understand you I would feel the same.
But if I would invest I wouldn't stinky don't tell them ��
@_date: 2019-10-01 22:14:08
Did you even read it?
Market cap would be 1,5 tril. and then btc dominance will be around 40% not now
@_date: 2019-06-15 07:09:55
They exit dude 99%.
14% per week it's not a warning signal?
@_date: 2019-06-22 07:50:50
Think about it again
@_date: 2019-06-16 23:56:47
First you can track yourself back from the first bought, exchange trough all the address to the last one.
Second you could sign a message to prove it.
@_date: 2019-06-16 22:26:38
Use an exchange app like bitstamp.
Fee is 0.25%
@_date: 2019-02-21 23:47:24
I had the same experience different company in Tokyo with big camera.
When I send BTC they got an error on there screen but my Bitcoin goes out. I try to explain this to the woman but she had no clue ��
They using bitflyer as there wallet service.
After 2 monthes I got the money back. It took long but there customer service was really good.
My conclusion they need to use simple wallets not a 3 party exchange.
@_date: 2019-02-07 15:53:32
Hi I have a question. I dont understand why do you BTCPay in this case if you cant exchange it auto.  
Why just don't use an apps like: coinomi, samurai?
@_date: 2019-06-16 22:18:48
@_date: 2019-06-20 12:01:51
You can do whatever you want as long as you are willing to accept the consequences ��

I think wasabi is not for Android
@_date: 2019-02-09 09:27:16
I wandet to Invest in stocks and trade them around 2016. The registration took a lot of time. Meanwhile a friend told me about BTC and for me it was similar.
So I forgot about the stocks and started with cryptos ;)
It was way easier and they didn't charge me so much like in stocks. I just wanted to play around with little sums.
At this time I started to read alot about cryptos and how they work as more I read as more I got excited. 
Today I'm a true believer and I see the potential behind it. It will take some time but that's how life is.
@_date: 2019-06-21 16:11:25
Why the hell you can deposit money there when you're not verified but the other way you can't withdraw it...
@_date: 2019-02-24 18:40:04
You buy at 4200 at the major resistance line fuck ��
@_date: 2019-06-13 14:16:39
How much is the fee?
@_date: 2019-02-12 16:54:29
Nice to hear that bro.
Never give up. People are just curious about new stuff and the media just writes dramatic story's about BTC and cryptos in general.
My aunt and other family members are the same. Stubborn and thinking they know shit about this new technology. They just talk about phrases from media, typical bullshit xD
I read an article where a guy said: don't give them to much room to talk otherwise they won't listen.
My experience with people, they don't like cryptos because they simply just don't understand it, is the same. If you let them talk to much they know everything better even when you can say 100% that's bullshit.
I'm happy my mother is really open and tried to understand it as good as possible. Some months ago she invested the first time and will do it every month now ^^
@_date: 2019-06-18 23:14:49
Haha nice. I need one
@_date: 2019-06-16 22:23:03
You can send them between address as much as you want. As long as you don't sold them somewhere, you can switch between addresses whenever you want.
But you have to proof you didn't sold in between the sending
@_date: 2019-10-08 11:00:51
Beautiful and sexy as fuck!
@_date: 2019-02-10 15:06:15
Haha awesome dude!
@_date: 2019-06-16 22:14:14
Same here but with a normal international bank transfer. They suck whenever it comes to long distance
@_date: 2019-10-26 10:20:04
Sounds great but don't forget to pay your taxes!
@_date: 2019-10-18 23:24:40
How to deal with it or them? 
Be patient and wait some years. In the end everyone will be looking 10x more dumb then you right now xD
Trust me ����
@_date: 2019-10-12 10:28:29
Even if you don't know a lot.
In crypto we say just invest what you are willing to lose.
In the end nobody knows where it goes but there is a high opportunity btc will be much more worth then now in the next few years.
If you can live with it to lose maybe 200$ you're fine.
I recommend to hold the btc in a wallet where you control the private key. Not in an exchange but remember there is a "high" fee for withdrawing btc right now especially on exchanges
@_date: 2019-02-20 08:12:58
I was also suprised ��
@_date: 2019-12-29 05:36:29
First is pretty weird a shop just accept bitcoin.
Be aware of scammers. 
Easiest way would be to buy btc at an atm, they charge +5% as a fee. If you live in Austria you can easy buy it at all post offices ������. 
For the ATM: you can check if there's is one at your location with an app called bitcoinmap/coinaradar. 
Sometimes there are not 100% up2date.
You could also try 
Otherwise you can use an exchange for that.
Coinbase is pretty big. I would prefer kraken. Verification could take 1-3 days.
You should definitely buy more then 370$ worth of btc even if it's got pretty stable for the last weeks. 
On exchanges you pay typically a fee of 0.0005 btc it's around 3-4$ right now. 
Last one be aware of scammers is pretty odd an online shop just accepts bitcoin... 
If you buy stuff at the dark web, remember every transaction with BTC is recorded. You are not anonymous!
If you want more Infos just pm me.
@_date: 2019-06-14 23:50:51
Haha how cute is that ��
@_date: 2019-06-24 22:45:55
Wtf around 1000$ fee like 10% &gt;.&lt;
@_date: 2019-12-02 17:32:22
Sure you can. Eat puke eat again.
Disgusting but works xD
@_date: 2019-12-01 14:42:49
Whatever don't let you withdraw is a fucking joke. Common seriously. For some people it's good so you can't "lose" your stuff and you are not alone responsible for it. Some people like that but if you can't decide where to move your stuff what's the purpose for that.
It break it down as an speculative investment. They suck the other advantage out of it. Congratulation...
But anyway good for adoption yes
@_date: 2019-12-02 17:29:36
Smart people
@_date: 2019-06-17 23:13:23
Looks like 2 post I saw in the last week's ��

That's fucked up in an ultra high level...
Sorry you had to go trough all this. At least I hope some people will learn about that and don't use exodus for swapping coins.

Check out bisq or try to find an bitcoin atm. If you by a small amount you don't need kyc
@_date: 2019-12-02 00:01:49
Own? Are these there tokens?
@_date: 2019-06-09 00:25:32
Don't worry bro most people don't have a clue about cryptos, how the financial system works and a lot of other stuff in this space.
In the end it's good, it shows BTC is still fucking young and need to develope alot before mass adoption.
Enjoy the right
@_date: 2019-12-20 16:40:53

Haha fuck you are right xD
@_date: 2019-12-04 16:46:37
I think if you move it often enough you get used to it.
I remember when I transact the first time. And now I just double check but I don't do a test transaction anymore
@_date: 2019-04-06 19:27:41

@_date: 2019-12-31 13:00:23
Omg this dude is even more dumb then anything I expected.
This motherfuckers won't bitcoin to grow because they can't launder money that easy with BTC like with fiat.
@_date: 2019-12-02 00:12:45
Sry for that. Be careful out there. Hopefully you didn't send her to much...
Next time buy on a bitcoin machine directly or on a big exchange like Coinbase, Kraken
@_date: 2019-12-11 09:44:53

Why 23 xD
It's 24 words ��^^
@_date: 2019-04-09 15:36:08
They can sell it's not a bad decision.
If you want to make tons of money, buy and sell (if you good at that). Whatever they want.
I'm pretty sure it will go higher as 200k but nobody knows, so to get something back and buy stuff, home, lambos xd why not
@_date: 2019-04-05 15:41:19
�� are you from Japan?
@_date: 2019-04-16 09:19:11
Damn that's really good ��
@_date: 2019-12-20 16:41:37
Sure 20000 yen on a wall would be a little bit too much ��
@_date: 2019-04-08 18:18:40
I know ��. They are not stupid.
@_date: 2019-04-04 11:37:16
Because he's good at this
@_date: 2019-04-11 07:49:57
That's a good point.
If you like to talk about Bitcoin it's cool. If you see there reaction don't match what you expect, step back and talk about the current system and why you think it sucks and don't work properly and ask them what they're thinking? You will see they're "dumb" they don't know shit about it.
Explain it and go back to BTC.
Works fine. Don't love cryptos to much give yourself room to rethink about it. Keep in mind it's not the Holy Grail ��
@_date: 2019-04-03 07:49:46
Nice man that's adoption!
@_date: 2019-04-06 23:43:25
Jeah slightly. I mean they sell some merchandise and have a BTM there. You can ask some questions but it's not that special. Maybe it is for beginners and people with no idea what BTC is
@_date: 2018-11-29 19:28:08
good idea thx :D
@_date: 2019-04-05 11:51:38
Nice to see everything worked fine for you.
I had a bad experience there last year.
Tried to pay with BTC transaction went trough but at there display it show failed.
I looked at block explorer, as I expected sure it goes through but the people don't had an understanding about this.
Bitflyer is the company behind big camera who stores and does the stuff with BTC.
In the end I got my ��/ BTC back but it took 2 months ��
@_date: 2018-11-29 18:54:47
by market cap
@_date: 2018-11-21 20:37:15
Yeah but it's not because you make this choice.
Otherones decide that for you and as everyone knows, it's one the way to collapse.
Just a matter of time. Look at the debs. Strong countries just survive longer...
For long term �� its dying.  
Only excepted because of old decision, not because you want it.
Only a few have the balls to talk about it --&gt;
People suck to change there minds. Look at the climate...
@_date: 2018-11-29 19:27:02
thanks for that. i think bitpay works the same or?
@_date: 2018-11-29 18:55:38
no \^\^  
i think monero and ltc is also a good choice, but i will let him decide :D
@_date: 2018-11-29 22:16:04
I will check this ��
Not sure about LN as I know it's still in beta. 
Personaly I'm not sure if it's good to use it now.
@_date: 2018-11-29 19:27:53
i dont want an exchange for him.
i think the best way is he just use a wallet (coinomi, samourai or something like that)
@_date: 2018-11-29 21:03:23
okay cool thanks a lot for this info. i will check it.
anyway he said he wants to collect the crytpos. 
i think the best way is a wallet where he has full control (private key) and if really a lot of people, what i dont expect, pay with cryptos I will tell him to buy a ledger :D
@_date: 2018-11-30 18:24:10

This people are fucking awesome.
@_date: 2019-01-04 08:28:47
Yeah but for publicity the logo would be better ��
@_date: 2019-01-22 22:18:54
Why it has to be registered with the cash register?
I can just simply use the ledger from BTC to show when I received what.
Mhhh which one can you integrate with the cash register?
@_date: 2019-01-04 08:41:04
You can buy and sell btc (+5% fee).
Buy merchandise and gift cards.
@_date: 2019-01-01 13:08:28
Cool u bought but next time buy somewherw else, the fee is way to much ��
@_date: 2019-01-16 14:49:17
Then it will have replaced all currencies xd
@_date: 2019-01-21 16:23:27
I wanted to invest in stocks small amounts but not over the bank.
I wanted to do it by myself but the registration took me to long.
Happily a friend told me about BTC some days after.
So I start to invest and read everything about it, blockchain, dlt, cryptos and how the money works
@_date: 2019-01-25 20:38:26

....peak was around 20k
@_date: 2019-01-10 00:47:47
Doesn't matter if you sell for fiat or simply swap them for other coins. You have to pay taxes if you don't hold more then a year (depends on the country).
Let's say you bought ETH at 100$ sell/swap now for BTC and ETH is worth at this point 200$ you have to pay ~25% on taxes.
So you gain +100$, even if you don't sell for fiat, worth in BTC*0.25=25$ taxes.
@_date: 2019-01-26 00:09:40
I thought the same, just a random line xD
@_date: 2019-01-22 22:19:47
They're some outside you right. I hope they just want to keep the cryptos much easier ^^
@_date: 2019-01-18 10:09:34
The whole financial system is manipulated as fuck.
Everything that has to do with �� cause of greed

Cool man! Awesome
@_date: 2019-01-03 20:07:48
Fee is 5% not 10.
Why they don't use the Bitcoin logo on the label?
@_date: 2019-01-30 09:10:28
So good ��

Use bitstamp or Kraken xd
@_date: 2019-01-10 08:04:17

But if u convert one coin to another coin.
For taxation it's the same process as you would sell it.
@_date: 2019-09-30 12:40:48

@_date: 2019-05-06 19:30:35


Wtf is wrong with this dude. He wants full transparency what people are buying? 
He's a moron
@_date: 2019-05-09 22:04:02
This is one of the best news for Bitcoin.
It shows the real power behind Bitcoin and yeah fuck he's right it shows people have a chance to take the power away and we are not only dependent from the usd anymore.
We have other choices now thanks to the big one
@_date: 2019-05-08 22:22:29
This comment is really a joke ��
@_date: 2019-05-21 21:06:45
Do you want future money worth 8k$ and maybe more in time or do you want 1$ fiat money build on debt :P 
The girl in the beginning, i thought omg shes dumb but maybe she dont know shit about bitcoin but then 2:00 I saw her again and I can say she's definitly dumb XD
@_date: 2019-05-08 22:21:27
This comment from CZ is really s joke.
We decided not to...
Get the fuck out man. What are you talking ��
@_date: 2019-05-12 22:53:56
Buy sell buy sell buy sell get reckt. That's a men's story
@_date: 2019-05-07 12:17:04
I had the same feeling reading this. It's fucking crazy.
@_date: 2019-05-12 22:47:39
(1125+625)/2= 875.
875-525=350 days left to hit 20k again
@_date: 2019-05-31 23:42:43
For this amount not but if I  would have to pay that fee, to move some bucks it is ��
@_date: 2018-12-05 12:35:17

@_date: 2018-12-24 23:09:14
I know some people 50+ they talk the same.
I think the biggest problem it's technical stuff and the older generation can't/ won't get it. I mean my mother is 60 and she asks me sometimes how she can put the volume up at here notebook xd
My aunt just talks bullshit she here's at the news and the rest has no opinion about that.
And really they don't need.
The youth is important older ones stick too older stuff. They just change when the have to not before.
Let's concentrate on the younger ones.
I teach and tell my kids in the school often about the system today and what's the pros and cons about cryptos and dlt.
@_date: 2018-12-25 23:56:31
Hi. This idea is really cool.
I don't fully understand it but I will make some researches .
Thanks for it
@_date: 2018-12-04 11:49:37
Haha that's so good ^^
@_date: 2019-05-31 21:58:38
True but the price is way too crazy.
Better by at an BTM machine +3-6%
@_date: 2019-05-31 17:50:55
Write it down cut and split it in pieces, store it at different locations.
Make a copy do the same thing and give it some people you trust.
Nobody had access only you and you're safe if you lose it, house get burned, amnesia *blablabla*
@_date: 2019-05-31 15:25:30

And why do we need crypto if we just can pay with MasterCard and Visa?
Do I miss something...¿
Makes no sense.
I knew that people will downvote my comment.
Horrible to see how simple this community is and defend the stupidest comments I've ever read about crypto ��
And by the way I don't care about Roger and bch.
