Dunno... as price increases it's possible to splurge a little bit and spend those new profits.
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:16:55
Impossible without major architecture change, not gonna happen. Privacy is built into XMR already.
@_date: 2017-12-02 12:58:18
I actually bought just a tiny amount to test this theory... it worked!
@_date: 2017-12-23 11:03:11
Only swing trade coins you don't mind holding if you guess wrong. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 17:04:30
Yeah, when I first started trading I set stop losses below price. Now I place buy orders! But you have to either add new fiat (not gonna happen) or sell at the highs. Ideally I would hedge with a BTC short but it looks like a PITA to set up with a broker, even if any would allow small individual investors.
So my plan is to get BTC on GDAX before Saturday so I can trade quick to USD if needed. For my alts it's more complicated. VTC seems to be more immune to drops in BTC than some others. XMR seems to be correlated closely to BTC drops (except for recent rally). Probably go to USDT for a couple hours if needed but that is a risk as well.
Sunday / Monday will be interesting and a solid indicator of price impact when CME starts a week later.
@_date: 2017-12-05 04:45:05
which leads to higher risk of a drop than a really?
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:39:32
Ill buy when it drops below 10k when the assholes on wall street spread their fud and weak hands sell.
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:10:11
How? Find a broker, set up an account, transfer funds by tomorrow? Serious question. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 13:34:43
Thanks! I'll look closer at this. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 02:06:30
Taxes, IRAs, lower risk of hacking? 
@_date: 2017-12-02 13:01:42
If you think there is a correction pending just get put now and buy in after.  Or set tight stops and buy bsck in quickly. Don't set a deep stop.
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:51:13
It's 100% a pump. Once big money can readily short they will open margin positions,  dump these new coins, make 5x on shorts versus what the actual coin looses then buy those coins back after the crash.  I'm in USD and some alts which are harder to short in volume. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:30:10
This has huge tax implications for day traders. Are you treating trades between alts as like in kind?
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:45:50
Fool me once....
@_date: 2017-12-29 15:18:26
@_date: 2017-12-29 08:41:50
Try explaining that to a thief... best to just state risk is too high and it's all in your 401k now. Or you lost it all on a risky alt. Or used profit to buy guns and security cams.
@_date: 2017-12-05 09:33:59
Young age is no money,  middle age  is no time,  old age is no health. Best to enjoy each stage and what you do have.
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:54:30
+1 for emotionally.  I just sold btc and feel better already. Will hold my alts or buy back post crash.
@_date: 2017-12-29 18:13:30
Thought i missed another fork! Not sure on bch short term though, will see what happens when coinbase unlocks all those coins soon.
@_date: 2017-12-05 04:39:47
Or goto fiat before Sunday and buy back in at a lower price. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:16:26
Yes, and data from exchanges. IRS just got info from coinbase users. Annual reporting same as brokers do is probably next reg. Hard to hide assets and if ur caught there is no statute of limitations on how long and far up your ass they can go. 
@_date: 2014-03-08 03:56:39
Slow withdrawals is a porn issue. GOX is full of shit - they did not miss these coins. See the link at VOS.
@_date: 2014-03-08 04:02:02
I was ready to use VOS today. Where to now? Need to buy LTC with BTC 
@_date: 2014-03-03 18:09:35
This is the advantage. Man, that was a smart buy, I only heard of BTC / SR when shit the fan and now am buying as many BTC as I can "afford to lose". BTC will be the gold standard and other cryptos will only follow, though I do like the long term prospects of PPC. 
@_date: 2014-03-18 21:15:27
Thanks man, keep up the good fight.
@_date: 2014-03-28 02:25:56
If the linked account is empty, it will get " canceled " for the cost of a bounced check.

Paper wallets people...

It's the next internet, rewriting how we handle currency in the same way the internet rewrote how we handle information. No longer do you need to go through established channels (libraries, newspapers) to publish or locate information. And with BTC, no longer do you need to use established channels (banks, credit card companies, govt) to transfer currency. 
Investing (buy and hold) in BTC is similar to GOOG or APPL stocks. As the technology is adopted (demand), the BTC supply pool is essentially constant, so price increases. Other cryptos will evolve, but first mover and popular recognition as a currency is a huge advantage.
Another benefit of BTC is anonymity, allowing the paranoid, underground economy and dark markets a currency with lower risk and lower transaction costs, further increasing demand. Recall that widespread adoption of the internet likely started with pornography, so one must look past (some very despicable) use on darkmarkets and consider the many advantages of cryptocurrency and micropayments on everyday living.
The biggest disadvantage is the need to run your own secure "bank" to avoid theft, though middlemen or new software will soon evolve that offer secure and easy storage. Coinbase accounts take only a few days to setup.
@_date: 2014-03-02 00:32:09
Would running the internet traffic to bitaddress through a VPN like PIA improve security? Or maybe using a secure VPN like I use at work everyday?
@_date: 2014-03-23 01:41:33
Surprised it stayed this strong...

tradingview.com works well for me, free version
@_date: 2019-08-09 00:39:02
Cost basis was zero, so I got that going for me.

Married over 25 years, still have an unused cake platter... At this point it's an antique so I'm just gonna hodl.

It is a massive waste of energy since we have mined 17 of 21 million already and energy per year used mining today is already more than some countries. 
So to get that last 4 million we will spend enormous energy, per year, for over a hundred more years! 
Ideally we should just call in enough now.
@_date: 2017-11-17 23:07:14
I'm done day trading, made a few, lost a few... all very stressful.  Its a 24/7 game.
Today I'm 75% BTC, the rest split between XMR and VTC. If I had just held at 2800 and bought more weekly i would have probably been better off than chasing trades. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:28:14
Apparently one new one is XMR only. But I like thus coin since illegal or not  many peopke don't want to publish how much they own or who they are.
@_date: 2017-11-01 02:10:24
It's 80 years from now, BTC will be a distant memory, replaced by Google coin or something. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 03:18:35
And would still need a coveted bitlicense.
@_date: 2017-11-01 02:07:00
Lol, good plan. I'll do the same with my BTG they (maybe) have.

Got me a 15' beast!

Good point. I'll forgo a hundred or two up to save a lot more down. Then buy back before  Nov 16.

A California federal court has ordered Coinbase to turn over identifying records for all users who have bought, sold, sent, or received more than $20,000 through their accounts in a single year between 2013 and 2015.

Taxes.

Exactly this.  Shady af.
@_date: 2018-02-14 00:59:25
Some viruses change copy paste of addys to hacker addresses. Either way, zero protection.
@_date: 2018-02-13 18:25:31
Less than zero.  No purchase protection, no cash back, fees to repurchase BTC,  risk of losing payments due to typos, taxes on capital gainz...

Put your stops in before bed, 4 am is when markets move.

I watched a 212 btc wall on bittrex at 5500 get chewed up in 30 seconds.

Let me know before you buy again
@_date: 2019-05-12 02:34:59
When it becomes more than you are comfortable losing, sell some. 
I had made a good amount, took out my original investment, but the rest i held.
Should have taken out a bit more in hindsight. 
Now I have is a lot less, back in the let it ride category.
@_date: 2018-12-10 17:36:12
August to October 2017. Actually paid some taxes last year due to trades. Pulled out some profits but nowhere near what I should have. 
Now if I trade or sell I'm limited to 3000 a year deduction until I die so selling, or even trading is not a good option until I could possibly get some gains to offset. 
At this point it's cold storage and hope that 5 or 10 years from now it will pay off.
BTC, ENG, ETH, VET

And they hurt INNOCENT people. Much worse. 
@_date: 2018-12-10 03:32:36
Or buy low, grind your way to 300 percent gains, dont sell and be back where you started and kicking myself.
