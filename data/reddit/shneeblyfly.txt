...or run an anonymous business with Bitcoin.
My gosh, it's amazing how many people supporting a system that (if it gains popularity) will abolish taxation can't get on board with the practical ramifications.

Thanks for the reply-- good point. 
I'm attempting to compensate for the core supporters v. average user gap by asking the number of Bitcoins owned (assuming more active "core community" members will own more), but you're right-- I'll definitely add this as a footnote when the results are posted.

This should convince anybody to reject the standard
*"...don't trust Wikipedia, anybody can edit it."*
line that is constantly repeated to discredit new media. Open editing could do this piece some good.

Updated, thanks for the correction. The website comparison was more of a supporting point-- the fact that any single pool can get so close to 50% shows that a high-quality video educating the public has to be produced.
This is exactly the type of thing the video needs to explain-- I was actually directed to that site by a Reddit user who was turned off by the 2% fees.

At least this helps resolve the *regulatory uncertainty* regarding Linux. -_-

Big thanks to everybody who responded. 
We celebrate new merchants who begin supporting Bitcoin, but how many of us shop at these websites? 
Results will be used in a school presentation and posted on /r Bitcoin.

/r Bitcoin is full of posts celebrating new merchants accepting Bitcoin-- but how often do we spend there? What can help improve buyer and merchant support for Bitcoin as a *currency*?
Responses will be used in a school project, as well as posted on r/ Bitcoin. 
Thanks to everybody who responded.

To the people siding with the government due to the unsettling CP accusations: this is circular logic. If we KNOW it's CP from other evidence and witness testimony, we can (and should) put the guy in prison without the contents of the hard drive. 
If we need the hard drive contents to prove this point,  the CP is just an accusation, and the government's argument falls apart. This means the government could coerce the decryption of anything, without due process (only accusation of a crime). That's insane. 
Yes, the presumption of innocence will lead to bad people getting away. Nobody denies this. Does this fact debunk the bill of rights? Of course not.

Hi folks, my name is Jeremiah. I’m a college student studying economics.
I recently finished this channel trailer for a new Bitcoin web series I’m looking to launch-- the “21 Million Club.” The name is meant to promote ownership of one Bitcoin as an eventual goal for those who cryptocurrency is appropriate for (as the promo states, this isn’t everybody).
I have a solid understanding of the basics of Bitcoin, and am good at editing video (I feel comfortable putting out beginners material). However I have limited time, and as we’ve seen over the past month, there are more nuanced issues which need to be addressed within the community.
Here’s my request: If you consider yourself knowledgeable and would be willing to contribute to this effort, either by writing an article/episode or being interviewed on video, I would greatly appreciate your help. The content could cover almost anything. How do public/private keys work? How is consensus formed? Why does RBF suck? Why is RBF the greatest? I can make your content look pretty in After Effects, and you’ll be credited as writing the episode.
Instead of videos/articles/etc. originating on debatable news sites, and reddit explaining why the content is misleading, I’d like to be a part of creating more content which originates within the community.
Regardless of whether or not you can contribute, I appreciate your support and feedback as episodes are released.
Go Bitcoin.

Buyer 1 --&gt; Wallet 1,
Buyer 2 --&gt; Wallet 2
...is certainly better than...
Buyer 1 --&gt; Wallet 1,
Buyer 2 --&gt; Wallet 1
However you still have to dip into these individual wallets to spend the funds, and they can thus be tracked. Buying something connected to your real name with an address one degree of separation away from a darknet site is bad news.

Not arguing this isn't a good thing, but the title is misleading.
You--&gt; Sell Coins--&gt; Give gov. USD 
...is no different (price wise) than...
You--&gt; Give gov. BTC --&gt; Gov. sells BTC for USD
The Bitcoin gets sold either way.

To be fair, the Trezor is a hardware wallet, so the code doesn't update automatically. A $1 hard fee ceiling would have seemed generous a year ago, yet would have rendered the wallets useless (without a firmware update) today.
