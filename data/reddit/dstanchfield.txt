First, this was implemented as a policy which you can enable on the device.  By default, this policy is disabled.  You have to opt-in to use this feature.
Second, it doesn't change the way the device behaves, just how it presents the transaction details to the user. You still need to trust ShapeShift to make good on the trade, as they are the ones that have signed off on the "contract" that KeepKey is displaying.

This is Darin from KeepKey.
That sentence is a little confusing.  What is means is we recommend restoring your private keys on a hardware wallet (new should be another).  We'll get that fixed so it is clear.
But wiping your KeepKey and restoring using your recovery sentence is very safe.
@_date: 2016-08-05 19:01:02
The 12 words are enough to restore your wallet.  You are also given a datestamp, which helps provide a bookmark to speed up blockchain sync.

Beta is released early next week, current extension version won't let you do this.  Contact us at support if you would like to try the beta.
@_date: 2016-08-17 21:02:38
Here is a list:
@_date: 2016-08-02 02:16:16
18 and 24 words are not available in our extension.  An easy way is to initialize the device in MultiBit which lets you choose sentence length.  Once initialized, it will work in both MultiBit and our extension.
Make sure you disable our Chrome Proxy while you use MultiBit or you may see some problems.
@_date: 2016-08-03 13:36:23
A quick word around is to re-initialize the device in MultiBit.  Your right though, our extension will make you wait (which probably isn't ideal when your failure time is at 16 hours).

We shouldn't fool ourselves in thinking that there is an exchange that is not at risk of being hacked.  This difference here is that ShapeShift is not a custodian of customer funds.  Our partnership lets you exchange between crypto currencies, while all customer funds remain protected by a hardware wallet.
@_date: 2016-08-17 16:24:33
It's that price just for today.
@_date: 2016-08-19 19:44:49
Video demo will be forthcoming.  But essentially, here is the steps to convert (for example) BTC to LTC:
1) In our extension goto "Send" and choose another account belonging to KeepKey.  If you choose an account that is a different crypto currency account, KeepKey queries ShapeShift for a exchange request.
2) Extension gets back a signed copy of the exchange request from ShapeShift and passes it on to KeepKey. KeepKey does validation including: ShapeShift signed correctly, conversion-to address and refund address belongs to KeepKey.
3) KeepKey displays the exchange details on device, where it must be manually be approved.
And thats it.  For the user, its as simple as choosing the crypto account to convert into and confirming the transaction on KeepKey.
@_date: 2016-08-20 15:30:16
You can actually enable and use passphases in KeepKey extension now.
@_date: 2015-12-18 18:10:58
Your on Linux, so there are some additional steps required.  You need to setup udev rules (just like you did for your Trezor).

This presentation is the result of a bad case of cognitive dissonance.  I didn't see the presentation itself, but the slides themselves give a very good picture of what is going on in Tim's head, a battle between his assumptions and reality. Tim attempts to warp reality to better fit with what he believes.
For example, Tim claims that bitcoin enthusiasts use the argument of VC's 800+ million investment as a reason they won't go other places.  Tim paints the statement as a sunk cost problem, and that VC's obviously won't throw good money after bad. This is Tim warping reality.  This has nothing to do with sunk cost, and everything to do with network effects.  Tim decided to focus on the money, instead of what that money is purchasing: infrastructure.

They say that no one rings a bell at the top. The same is true for bottoms.  Sentiment changes, but never gives notice.
Those trying to find a "cheap" entry point in price that either ends very high or at zero are embarking on a fools errand.  Unfortunately, bitcoin has a very bad habit of making people think they are professional day traders.

I think Keith is fundamentally right, bitcoin is at odds with US regulation. His mistake is believing the omnipotent ability of regulators.
By the time law makers realize the complete ramifications of bitcoin, the horse will be out of the barn. They won't be able to criminalize bitcoin use, because doing so will make a large percentage of American's criminals.

@_date: 2014-05-25 19:12:41
This is an interesting report.  But here is my main problem with it, maybe someone can help me get my head right...
At the end of the day, net on net, it was bitcoins that went missing when MtGox went bankrupt and not USD.  This bitcoin liability implies that there is a debt of bitcoins to real accounts, not fake internal ones.
This lack of real bitcoins backing accounts on MtGox, or people owning bitcoins that didn't exist, implies an artificial supply of bitcoins to the market.  This effect would have put pressure on the bitcoin price downwards, not upwards.

No, it means less USD.  $112 million to be exact.
The report theorizes that Karpeles controlled bots manipulated the bitcoin price up.  That means phantom USD chasing real bitcoins. If I had sold bitcoins to one of these bots, I was not receiving real USD, only a ledger entry. At the end of the day it would mean very large USD liabilities and small bitcoin liabilities. We saw the exact opposite take place.

I'd like to point out that what Daniel is describing as "strong network effects" in currency actually has some game theory behind it. There is a concept called Focal Point that seems very relevant here.

There is a big difference. Your confusing economics with the scientific method. In economics, testing theory is very difficult because it is nearly impossible to run a controlled experiment.

Your right, I am assuming these were settled. If they weren't than the fraud  that took place was more elaborate than a bot.  A bot could interact with the exchange to manipulate price up, but what your suggesting would require a parallel db of trades, one for real trades and one for fake.
I am immediate suspicious of conspiracies that require me to make mental leaps in logic. My problem boils down to this: We saw large liabilities in bitcoins: this means bitcoins were stolen or bitcoins were sold that did not exist. We saw small liabilities in USD: this means if the Willy report is true, Karpeles funded the bots with real USD to manipulate the price up.  And that is just insane.

Actually, hacking has always gone on. Name a month in the history of Bitcoin and I'll name you a hack.
But here is what is key: a hack that doesn't kill bitcoin makes it stronger. I know it this is hard to believe if you are looking to make short term profit.  However, a system that is under constant attack evolves. Just like forest fires clear the brush for seedlings to prosper, these attacks serve an important part of the ecosystem.

My biggest hang up with Ripple is this: when you receive value in the Ripple system, it is actually just debt that you received backed with someone's obligation to pay you. In bitcoin when you receive value, you actually receive it and all debts are extinguished. Bitcoin is not a bearer instrument, it is actual property being transferred.
Debt based systems work great while there is high levels of trust in the system.  They work horribly however when that trust evaporates (i.e. 2008). We haven't seen how Ripple operates in low counterparty-trust environments, but it is safe to assume that it would be similar to how our banking system operates (another debt based system).

We use ShipWire for international shipments. We don't ship anything less than Priority, or it will not have a tracking number. Here is a screenshot from our ShipWire interface for our Chicago warehouse to a random zip code in UK: 
We are actively working to get better prices, and that includes having distributors in individual countries.

You pretty much summed it up succinctly. I'd add we haven't refused to offer passphrases, but our priority since launch is the very newest of Bitcoin users, and that is obviously reflected in our UI.

You can use either 24, 18 or 12 words on KeepKey.  And since we support the exact same BIP39 mnemonic, you can bring your 24 words from Trezor and have it "just work" on KeepKey.  If you have a passphrase, it will "just work" as well but you will have to use Electrum to see it recognized until we add passphrase support to own extension.
@_date: 2016-03-25 21:07:01
We are trying get better pricing for international orders through distributors at the moment.  Unfortunately, for the time being these are the prices. There are cheaper ways to ship but if you have seen CryptoSteel's issues you will understand that cheap sometimes means non-delivery.
@_date: 2016-03-25 16:06:48
We ship internationally. Check our website for available countries.
We have the similar passphrase feature your asking about.  Right now, it can only be used on our device if your using it with Electrum as our Chrome extension doesn't support it yet.
@_date: 2016-03-25 22:39:02
We are actually working on integrating DHL, it does appear to be the best solution for international.  Unfortunately it requires us to do a few more steps with ShipWire.
I'll have to circle back and look at first class if they do allow tracking. Our hands our tied a little bit since fulfillment only exposes a limited amount of information from what carriers provide.  
Trust me though, there is no one here that thinks $50 for shipping is good value propisition.

Type "KeepKey.enablePassphrase(true)" and enter 
Press the button on your device to enable passphrase on your KeepKey 
Click on the extension icon (the pancakes). This will close the developer tools window and the extension itself 
Reopen the extension, it will ask to you create your passphrase. Do NOT forget your passphrase. There is absolutely no way to recover the word you have chosen. If you do forget it, your BTC are unaccesible. 
You are now in your passphase protected account. To go to your old accounts, simply do not enter your passphrase (leave it blank) when prompted and press "Send Passphrase". Remember the passphrase account is completely separate from the account/s which are not passphrase protected.

This is Darin from KeepKey. Your also actually able to use KeepKey with MultiBit and Electrum.  If you do use an alternative client, make sure you disable the KeepKey App in Chrome so there is no interaction.
@_date: 2017-01-01 15:20:00
The KeepKey device does not trust KeepKey chrome extension because the extension resides on a connected machine.  This is why each and every transaction must be manually reviewed and approved on KeepKey's display. There is no special permission that our extension receives...  The working assumption is that KeepKey is plugged into a compromised computer. KeepKey only signs transactions that are manually approved by button, and signs only what is displayed to the user on it's display.

Any attempt to upload firmware to KeepKey not signed by us and KeepKey will wipe your private keys.  It will also prompt you at boot that the firmware is not official.  
Our firmware signing keys (5 of them in which at least 3 are required to sign) remain offline and offsite at all times.  This was a compromise of our email service, not the KeepKey device or it's code.
@_date: 2016-12-26 18:41:07
So "our servers" actually refer to our website / other misc servers we run.  We use third parties for providing blockchain data.  There is also no KeepKey device identifying information seen or collected by us.  So this hack doesn't effect your KeepKey or the balance information of the device.

We actually don't do a "are you sure" step. We might add this though if we see problems with a simple 1-step.


It should be very easy to get our device working with anything that supports Trezor.  We actually unit test using a modified version of the Trezor python client.  We are working with both MultiBit and Electrum teams (they both have devices or they will shortly), and so far integration has been painless.


Yes.  We had a brief conversation with Coinkite already, and we see a lot of value for customers being able to multisig in these arrangements.  We also have some really cool multisig things we are playing with, but for that you will have to stay tuned.


So, essentially you must first install our Chrome extension.  When you go to use it the first time, it will prompt you to install a Chrome App.  The App does the actual device communication, and then relays it to the extension.  We don't have any servers for blockchain data.  We currently are using chain.com but are migrating to blockcypher.  In the end, we will probably have multiple backend providers in case one is down.  I can promise you this: we will not be running a self hosted BoP server ;)  Also, we don't maintain any servers for the extension/app to work, so we will not see any transactions.  The client only communicates with chain.com or blockcypher. Both App and Extension are open source, so you can verify this.  You can also watch outgoing connections to make sure we didn't sneak anything in.  I would add though, we take Privacy very seriously.  If there is ever a feature that requires us hosting it on a server, we will rethink the feature.


Only bugs, and changes in the common code they would benefit from.  For example, our recovery process would be difficult to do on the Trezor because of screen real estate.  We did find a minor bug earlier this year, and we did a pull request on it.
@_date: 2015-08-12 21:04:37
At this point, no it does not do that.  That sort of step does make sense though.
@_date: 2015-08-13 01:07:14
I am worried more about the wrench attack vector.
@_date: 2015-08-13 02:17:30


In the extension, you can change this setting.  And if there are 18 or 24 words, it will just show a page for each set of 12 words (if they fit).


No, standard initialization does not display this.  This is how myTrezor does it as well.


On the KeepKey, it is very clear when it receives a "Cancel" message.  You do not need to trust the extension.
@_date: 2015-08-12 20:37:33
USB ID is a number that needs to be added/changed. Not that complicated. ;)
@_date: 2015-08-12 17:32:38


We were both running low on sleep, and not particularly articulate.  
So, the biggest difference is the display which is much larger than Trezor's.  This allows for details to be shown large (for example recovery sentence and transactions) so mistakes are not made.  It also let's us do the recovery process highlighted in the video (we also did a screencast on it  This recovery process is more secure than Trezor's. You don't even need to store your private keys on KeepKey.  Simply wipe after each use, then do recovery when you want to spend. 
@_date: 2015-08-12 21:32:57
Very shortly we will announce that and that we are shipping, I promise!
@_date: 2015-08-13 00:20:30
I agree.  I would add though that in the future (if you have considerable bitcoin wealth) it will not be wise to carry all of it around with you on your smart phone.
@_date: 2015-08-13 00:10:49
Great questions!


First, KeepKey can use 12, 18 or 24 words.  We just default to 12 in our client.  12 words is actually quite secure.  Trezor originally defaulted to 12 words, but changed to 24 because their recovery method wasn't quite secure with 12.  We believe that more words means more opportunities to write down the incorrect mnemonic, and so this is why we default to 12. (and by the way, sometimes 12 words runs onto a second page on KeepKey)


Ours is exactly the same, but just like Trezor, entropy is only shown when requested by the client.


You hold down the one button while pluging in your device.  It is difficult to do by mistake. Our extension detects firmware update mode and walks you through update.


First, the Trezor protocol supports a "Cancel" message.  So, for example, clicking out of our extension automatically cancels what KeepKey was doing.  Also, every confirmation prompt in our extension has a cancel option.  Having an additional mechanical button on the device for something that is used less than %5 of the time is bad design we feel.
@_date: 2015-07-22 16:34:32
It get's displayed on the device, not the computer.
@_date: 2015-07-20 23:08:21
So, under the hood on both KeepKey and Trezor, every time during PIN entry, flash is erased and written. This is because PIN failures are pre-incremented before an entry attempt to make sure failures are counted and timeouts are enforced. Your private keys are on the same sector as this failure count. :)
@_date: 2015-07-20 22:30:35
BIP39 and BIP44 structure
@_date: 2015-07-20 18:16:14
You can import your own private key, but we don't support that feature in our extension only because doing so defeats the purpose of KeepKey. But the Python client and Node client will let you do that via command line if you so wish.
@_date: 2015-07-20 19:55:26
Actually, flash memory on a device like KeepKey is measured in program/erase cycles. Our MCU has 10,000 PE cycles at room temp.  One way we differ from Trezor is we use a technique called wear leveling to increase that up to 30,000 cycles.
@_date: 2015-07-20 23:38:48
level 2
@_date: 2015-07-22 15:20:20


This is the very reason that KeepKey has a large display.  The goal was to show the recipient address as large as possible and never line break it.  On your computer, addresses are rarely line broken. And big, you know, because we hate eye strain.
@_date: 2015-07-21 16:58:47

@_date: 2015-08-18 17:30:44
Sorry For the Delayed Response.


Initially we will only support simple wallet functionality.  But all of the things you listed are things we want to fully support.  Fee selection will be done at transaction time with a dropdown (slow, medium, fast).


I have our device working great with MultiBit and we are currently working on integration with their team.


We have discussed doing this, as well as some other penetration detection.  You will probably see this added fairly shortly.


We chose Chrome because it allows for USB communication without requiring a user to install any extra software.  That said, we plane on complete integration with all the browsers but it will not be as seamless as Chrome (it will require extra software).


Trezor and KeepKey have different boards / displays.  Getting Trezor code to run would require a lot of modifications unfortunately.


Thank you very much!

@_date: 2015-07-22 22:49:23
Trezor asks you to enter your recovery words in a random order. A connected computer can see those words, just not the correct order. At 24 words, the strength of its method is 79 bits of entropy.

@_date: 2015-07-22 19:11:22
from our FAQ: First, KeepKey displays a cipher to be used for entry. The cipher reshuffles for every character entered. After three or four characters, KeepKey can autocomplete the word being entered. When you see the word you are trying to enter autocompleted on KeepKey, you can continue on to the next word. The only information you leak to the computer KeepKey is connected to is if the word was finished being entered on either three or four characters. At a minimum, entering a twelve word recovery sentence using KeepKey’s recovery process has a strength of 111 bits of entropy.
@_date: 2015-07-21 16:59:28
It's up: 
@_date: 2015-07-20 19:31:54
We use BIP 39, so you can use the recovery sentence anywhere.
@_date: 2015-07-20 19:56:56
KeepKey is magnet proof :)
@_date: 2015-07-21 06:30:39
111 bits of entropy entering twelve words.  That means you don't need to store your private keys on the device if you are super paranoid.  Just wipe the device after each use, then recover off your paper backup when you need to transact.  It is actually a pretty quick process since you only have to enter 3 or 4 letters of each word.
@_date: 2015-07-22 20:58:34

We do not, we do not run any servers.  Our extension does use chain.com for a backend though, so they will see transactions.
That said, it will be very easy to get Electrum or Multibit working with our device.  We will be exhibiting at Digital Currencies + the BLOCKCHAIN in NY next tuesday, and will be demoing KeepKey with our Chrome extension as well as a modified version of Electrum.

No secure chip element.  Our board is not based on theirs though.  The part that was forked was crypto (which they actually forked) and bitcoin specific libraries.
@_date: 2015-07-22 21:09:24
Yes.  Recovery sentence words become unique at either 3 or 4 characters, so KeepKey doesn't let you type in the whole thing.  Actually, if KeepKey made you type in the whole word, you would be leaking word length which makes the recovery process less secure.
@_date: 2015-07-22 15:23:59
On KeepKey, you don't even need to store your private key on the device.  The recovery process is secure enough, that you can use it only as a transactional device for your paper (recovery sentence) wallet. Then just wipe the device after each use.
@_date: 2015-07-20 22:07:46
Software is similar: KeepKey's protocol us a superset of Trezor's.  That said, the KeepKey experience is different. Come by our booth at a conference so you can see what I am talking about. :) We will be at Digital Currencies + the BLOCKCHAIN in NY next tuesday.

Hey, this is Darin from KeepKey. The specific threat of a manipulated random number generator on device is somewhat alleviated as KeepKey doesn't rely on it's own entropy for private key generation but also uses entropy provided by the computer. Bad entropy from either independant source won't give you a less secure private key. Both sources would need to be comprimised.
But we take seriously what the OP is talking about.  Our goal at KeepKey was not to replace the "Trust this service" with "trust this hardware".  That is why we open source our code. We aren't trying to change who or what you trust, but eliminate the need for trust altogether. 
In general, with us and our competitors, there is a much lower level of trust you must place in these products than online and or closed solutions.
@_date: 2015-07-21 06:38:05


You don't actually need a button to cancel, since the protocol has a "Cancel" message. 99% of interaction on a device like this is confirming intent: why have an additional mechanical button that is rarely needed?  So in our Chrome extension, if you need to cancel an operation, simply click out of the popup box or the tiny red cancel link.

You won't be able to get it from the extension.  You'll need to use a client which lets you get at it.  Electrum might do this, although I am not 100% sure.
You can also install our python command line client.  It will let you get the xpub.

I actually read your page.  I should charge you a bitcoin or two for the time you stole from me, because it was time well wasted.
Here is basically what I read: Soon it will be a lot cheaper to mine 
Bitcoin, so Bitcoins are going to become cheaper.  Your theory proves either of two things: you do not understand how Bitcoin difficulty works, or you don't understand supply and demand.  Let me explain...  
In a normal market, cheaper production is usually captured in the price of an item.  A farmer learns a new way to grow corn cheaply, corn gets cheaper.  Why does this happen?  Well the farmer doesn't feel generous and pass the savings on to his customers.  What happens is the farmer produces more corn than he normally would, and the increase of supply of corn meets an unchanged demand for corn.  Boom!  Lower prices.
Now lets try this scenario for Bitcoin.  Bitcoin has something that corn doesn't, and it's called difficulty.  Simply put, difficulty ensures that any efficiencies in mining are absorbed during production.  Supply is fixed at a steady rate.  The law of supply and demand dictate market prices, and because of Bitcoin difficulty, supply cannot change.  Therefore, demand alone is what determines price in the Bitcoin market.

You can store multiple different kinds of assets at the same time on KeepKey, and all can be recovered with the same 12 word recovery sentence. A branch in the BIP32 tree is chosen for each asset (described in BIP44), so assets don't co-mingle with the same private keys.

Whoa, hold on there a second. Do you think you might be giving this guy a little more credit than he deserves.  When you say someone has caused signifiant damage to Bitcoin, you really need to qualify that with some evidence.  Instead to me it just sounds like hyperbole.
They say any publicity is good publicity, and I think that is the case here. I for one welcome Chris Duane and his videos. And you do realize that by posting his videos here, and making a grand claim that he is causing significant damage to Bitcoin, your giving him some publicity. 
Bitcoin will stand or fall on it's own merits.  If you think some videos on youtube can bring it down, well then, I don't think you really understand Bitcoin.

It is unfortunate that the media is unwilling to invest more than 5 minutes of research into something before doing a segment on it. Mike Pento even admitted that he did not do his own research, but resourced it out to his crack IT department.

@_date: 2013-12-09 16:56:35
So I am assuming you have experienced your first bitcoin transaction. I'd like to point out a few non-obvious, but important things.
First, somebody directly sent you value from somewhere else on the Internet. There was no third-party ever involved in this transaction, just you and the person sending you that value. Before bitcoin, this was impossible. This has a lot of ramifications, one big one being that transaction can never be reversed.
Secondly, because there was no third party involved, you now have a store of value with zero counter-party risk. No central authority can go bankrupt on you, bail-in your account, or freeze your bitcoin assets. Essentially, bitcoin is the first digital currency that truly belongs to you.
And finally, because of the P2P network that is bitcoin, no one can ever shut it down. So whenever you hear the question, "Won't governments shut this down?": it is impossible without completely shutting down the internet. We might never see governments ban it outright because such laws would be unenforceable.

I have thought this very thing before. By the time that the establishment actually takes bitcoin seriously, it will be too late to stop its takeover of the financial system.
@_date: 2013-03-06 05:09:58


People underestimate first mover advantage when there is network effect. Bitcoin won't be overtaken by a similar type of currency for the same reason there is only one Internet.  The value is in the network. Every user Bitcoin adds, it becomes more difficult to unseat it by the competition. At this point, for another type of digital currency to beat Bitcoin, it has to be considerably better and maintain all the features of Bitcoin. It can't just be marginally better, or a different flavor.
Secondly, there is enormous incentive for Bitcoin miners to use their rigs to attack newer competing currencies that use the same provable work method if there is even a slight hint it could be competitive to Bitcoin.

I believe I am the one that called you weak-handed.  I don't think you understood my comment's intention.  I was not insulting you for selling, just because your selling doesn't necessarily make you weak-handed. It is that you had made a post on reddit telling people your plans to sell, as if to seek validation. This need for validation is what makes you a weak hand, looking for approval from the herd if you will.  If your post was about your intentions to purchase, well that that would make you a weak hand as well.

As someone who listens to Peter's show regularly, I always cringe when I hear him talk about bitcoin. His knowledge about bitcoin does not go beyond it's price, so it is easy to see why he thinks it is a bubble.
Bitcoin requires effort and research to actually understand it, and that is why it is so easily dismissed. I wish Peter had actually put in the effort to understand it; looking at the price and calling it a bubble is sloppy and lazy. Using his analysis we could as easily say gold was in a bubble (which Peter is very fond of.)

Yes, bitcoin is technically inflationary, but demand is outstripping supply and the effects are deflationary. Prices for goods denominated in bitcoin are decreasing.

Your scenario you described is Walmart trying to corner the bitcoin market. They could also try to buy up all the coins on the exchanges to the same effect.  But what incentive does Walmart have to do this.  They would essentially be taking their USD profits to corner the bitcoin currency which when cornered would become worthless (see Hunt brothers and silver).  They would basically be throwing away their USD, and they have no incentive to do that.

If your investment horizon is measured in days, then yes, the April crash was devastating. But we are now reaching a point where most people who bought during the last run up have seen return on their investment, and we are only 6 months out from the crash.
@_date: 2013-12-04 00:53:42


Gold production has actually increased over time, due to technology in mining:
The classical gold standard was deflationary, and prices reflected this. On average, prices decreased during that time period.


This statement lacks any historical or data backing. Gold has always had a deflationary effect on prices, this is something most schools of economics agree on including Keynesians and Austrians.

First, you have to decide if you think Bitcoin will be successful. This is because it's value will be binary, either $100000+ or $0.  It's that simple.
I believe Bitcoin will be successful, thus I put a future value at at least $100,000.  Next, in order to reach this value in the future, say maybe 10 years, at some point there will be a tipping point where bitcoin starts dramatically increasing in price, and it will probably feel like a bubble. When I purchased my coins a few years ago (yes I got them before the crash in 2011) I made the decision no matter price fluctuation, they were not being sold, and I've been able to say I've kept that promise to myself.  I have bought stuff with them but that doesn't count :)
I do not think this 'bubble' will burst, but if it does, I will probably buy more on big a drop.  I think this is just the tip of the iceburg.  What scares me the most, what I worry about, is that when it really starts speeding up in value I get cold feet and sell my stash.

I purchased a majority of my coins at $2-$3 right before the big run up in 2011. Here is the thing, I never considered myself an early adopter as there were those at the time that had bought in at $0.25 or less. Those I thought were the real pilgrims.
I think now though, that anyone buying in before full monetization of bitcoin will be an early adopter.

For starters, Satoshi had no choice but to choose deflation over inflation. Inflation would have discouraged early adopters (or hoarders), and it would have only been a matter of time before a deflationary altcoin came along to unseat it.


This requires a little imagination and vision to see how this will take place. Let's pretend bitcoin stabilizes in price and continues to appreciate in value, being very deflationary. As a merchant, you have every incentive to accept bitcoin in this scenario, and in fact encourage your customers to pay this way. Customers however will be encouraged to spend their fiat first and hoard bitcoin. Yes, a deflationary feedback loop.  But, this doesn't mean doom for bitcoin, this means doom for fiat. Good money chases out bad. In all of history, there has never been a single instance of a deflationary death spiral, however, there have been many cases of hyperinflation. So fiat will die to hyperinflation while a great transfer of wealth takes place into bitcoin.

Fiat, by it's definition, gets it's value by authority decree.  Bitcoin does not, it gets it's value from scarcity and cryptographic proof. It is more like gold than you think.


Bitcoin is the most transportable money that ever existed.  There is no cheaper way to transfer wealth between two points. As for needing an Internet connection: You realize most cell phones, even in third world countries, have an Internet connection.


It is easier to turn lead into gold than to create a fake bitcoin.  The more you write, the more it is obvious you haven't actually researched bitcoin.


I understand the risks.  I also own a lot of gold: I consider them both similar stores of wealth. It is obvious to me that you have a very cursory understanding of Bitcoin, yet you feel you can pontificate whether it is a reasonable investment strategy or not. I would have actually respected your position if you had actually spent some time researching the subject.

I heard him talk about this on the radio, and it was making my head spin. His argument against bitcoin really boils down to the premise that bitcoin doesn't have intrinsic value.
I really believe that if Peter actually spent the time to understand the bitcoin protocol, its rules and how they are enforced, it would be something he would get behind. Unfortunately, he seems to be unwilling to do this because of his "gut reaction" that bitcoin has no intrinsic value. I say "gut reaction" because it is apparent when listening to him speak about bitcoin that is knowledge of it is cursory.

The common reason that is floated around why bitcoin is in a bubble is that it's price has increased too fast. The mistake in this assertion might be that bitcoin's value should not be compared to time (which will always be linear), but instead to user base growth.

I believe  (stabilizing at a predictable deflationary rate), and this is why:
Bitcoin is a very very small illiquid market. A $100k buy or sell moves the market. So the question about prices stabilizing is a chicken and egg question. Will bitcoin's volatility scare off capital, capital that is needed to make bitcoin less volatile. Or will volatility merely slow the inflow of capital.  I think it's the latter.

Every time we go through these panics, coins are basically spreading into more and more hands, while larger stashes get diminished.  Just like a forest needs a wildfire to clear brush for the seedlings to prosper, the same is for bitcoin. While these panics are rough sometimes, at the end of the day bitcoin is healthier for it, and we can get ready for the next leg in its journey to 1M.

Congratulations! You were able to lose money in a bull market that has gone up over 4000% this year alone. It takes a special kind of person to be able to do this.
@_date: 2013-04-12 17:30:42


Your exactly the person that bubble corrections weed out. It does suck if you or someone you know lost money, but don't blame it on bitcoin.  Blame it on following the herd.
BTW, that same herd is in selling mode now.  Same people making the same mistakes.  This is why bitcoin will be volatile until we have real liquidity.

"Having reservations" is the first step, the second step is "obsession."  At least that is how the process worked for me.

You could certainly design this altcoin. 
But that said, how you convince early adopters to invest or "save" in this altcoin, that almost guarantees by definition that any at-risk investment will only maintain it's value or shrink.

It does not matter where the site is operated, and if it is legal in that jurisdiction. What matters is where the site is used and marketed (in this case the US), at least to federal prosecutors. I am looking at an ad for SD right now on Reddit, submitted by Erik.
I suggest looking at Gary Kaplan, for a similar situation:

When it comes to protocols, winner takes all. I hate to break the bad news, but bitcoin will be the winner unless there is a flaw, and I assume that if there is a flaw, it will probably exist in most of the altcoins.

There have been many deflationary currencies in history though, for example the classical gold standard in the US, where money actually appreciated in value ~3% each year.  We are not in uncharted waters, although no one alive today has really experienced a deflationary currency.

No way, litecoin is just a pump and dump.  The real star is heavycoin which just came out today. It's too late to make any money on bitcoin, and litecoin now too. The key is to keep exchanging into the newest crypto currency. /s

This is the concept of "good money chasing out bad," bitcoin will be hoarded and dollars spent.  But in return, you will see merchants only accepting bitcoin, as they have the same preference towards hoarding.  Like I said, this spells doom for the dollar, not bitcoin.

@_date: 2013-04-10 00:53:52
I get that.  It is a valid concern.  One thing to look at though is bitcoin's history to see how this has played out so far.  It started at a nickel and has climbed it's way over $200 in four years, all the while transactions have increased, legitimate purchases with bitcoins.  Bitcoins are still being traded and increasingly so, they have not gone into hiding. If we can increase like we have and not had it effect trade in the economy, at what point should it?

When a business chooses to save in bitcoin, the wealth used to purchase those coins are not destroyed. You have to look at the other side of the equation, someone sold those bitcoins to the business, and is now putting that wealth to work (and probably better than the original business could for the return). All this coordination is done automatically, allocating capital to where it is best utilized.
Everything you've theorized is not based on history or fact. For example, the industrial revolution took place during the classical gold standard, and it marked a period of great investment.

Big claims need big evidence, that is all I am saying.  All he needs to do is sign the statement. The guy made a throwaway account, and you have to ask yourself what would motivate someone to announce their intention to sell 1 mil worth of bitcoins. No jealously here, just not a big fan of FUD.

Stopped right there. Greed is a human trait, and it's not more prevalent today than it was in the past. Your comment brings to mind this gem from Milton Friedman:
Rampant greed is not our problem. Our problem is rampant greed without the equally powerful human trait: fear.

You sir are thinking in terms of USD since you have no bitcoin holdings. Let me share my perspective. Everytime I take one of your USD profits, I lose valuable bitcoin.  So yes, taking a USD profit today is the same thing to me as taking a loss.
@_date: 2013-12-02 18:30:52
In game theory, there is a concept called focal point, and it deals with how participants in a coordination game, without the ability to communicate with each other, will choose the same solution because it seems inherent or natural to them. This is why when it comes to protocols, winner takes all. What you are commenting about is actually a real phenomenon, and will be the reason why bitcoin eventual wins the crypto currency race.

Side question. I didn't realize Erik operated SD. I've listened to him speak, he carries the torch well for bitcoin.
Does he realize how big of a target he has placed on his back for a federal prosecutor? He is an American citizen living in the states, operating a gambling website. He also advertises the service here on Reddit. He needs to decide if SD profits are worth it, and if they are move offshore immediately.  The way federal prosecutors work, they don't call first.  They usually just show up at the door with handcuffs.
Am I missing something?
@_date: 2013-12-04 01:52:28
I think the problem of people converting their bitcoin to other currencies to buy things is an infrastructure problem, and not something inherent to bitcoin. I think this is the stop gap until we see big merchants accepting bitcoin payments. This is the big question though, and who knows how things will play out.  So far it's promising, and the incentives are there.
@_date: 2013-12-04 01:27:08
What I meant is, during the classical gold standard, prices in general declined.  For example, a suit would generally be cheaper in the future if you chose to put off purchasing it immediately.  This is hard to imagine in the inflationary world we now find ourselves in.


You implied that because gold became deflationary it became an "investment vehicle." I am merely saying gold was always deflationary, and I am not sure what you mean by a "investment vehicle." Gold has been hoarded (or saved) for centuries. This "investment vehicle" is not a modern phenomenon.

You need leave emotions at the door.  I'm speaking as someone who purchased at $2 prior to the 2011 crash, and never has been tempted to sell once.  The reason: I know if bitcoin is successful, it is wildly underpriced.  Thats the nugget of info I keep tucked under my pillow at night so I can sleep.
