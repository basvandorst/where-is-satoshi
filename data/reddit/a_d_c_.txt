Technically it's not multisig. You need 1 device to prepare the transaction and 1 offline device to sign the transaction, the secret for that signature is stored in the mobile device's secure enclave and only unlockable with biometrics. This ensures that your secret cannot leak. Using USB devices can be a slippery slope because if your "hot" device is infected it could theoretically try to bypass the air gap by shipping executable code on that USB without you knowing it. QR's on the other hand are easier to verify and won't allow for bigger data transfers. (I'm an AirGap Dev)

well done

this is actually very good, they are scared and try to fight it. But its superiority will win long term, you can’t stop this revolution.

This is seriously an issue, real-world adoption of crypto is still far from optimal. People keep their coins on exchanges and just speculate with them without really understanding what technology changes and how this is a paradigm shift for humanity. I really hope that the more media coverage it gets, the more people try to understand it educate themselves, that's when it will really add value.

Bitadrress is a nice tool and also was used as reference while implementing this. However the video/audio feed gives the tool the power to have a lot of additional entropy without the need for the user to do much...


The numbers show the average diff between 1 frame and the other. You will find that this numbers grow if you move or produce some audio.

The thing is this depends on your requirements. I consider this to be secure if you reach a level of +-2000 for video an audio and +400000 for the mouse.

what does real mean?
@_date: 2017-11-25 17:30:43
don’t let emotions guide you...

many people in the Philippines don’t have a bank account, but do have smartphones. Even though there are a couple of security issues on the way, using BTC to store wealth can be a great opportunity for this country.

don’t get me wrong, I love BTC. But having to pay 7$+ for a transaction or waiting a day for it to go through was definitely not on purpose...
@_date: 2017-11-25 17:41:02
sadly BTC is not usable as a cheap cross border/international form of payment anymore... Doomed by its own success...

there are a couple of papers discussing the blocksize, the main issue is propagation delay and thus risk of segregation, he spam story I hear now for the first time. I’m not saying the limit of 1MB isn’t on purpose, my point is only that it’s not an ideal system you can use for transactions anymore, which in the beginning was its main purpose.
@_date: 2017-11-25 23:01:26
not saying you can’t use it to transact, however I’m saying it’s not so cheap anymore...
@_date: 2017-11-25 22:59:50
phaha niice :)
@_date: 2017-11-27 08:14:13
larger blocks are useless and will only solve the problem short term. Thus it’s not a real solution...

Bitcoin Address Watcher on the Android play store does exactly that. I created this app to be able to monitor my balance without putting my private key on the phone. -
