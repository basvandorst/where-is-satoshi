Had similar story with mobile wallet where I put some spare change ~$25 worth of btc at that time. Then forgot about the wallet cause started using different platform. Recently recovered the wallet - $1k+ on it. Merged with the main cold storage. HODL

It's like Bitcoin - it's awesome technology (like human are all awesome by design/creation), but some times has very high volatility to be used as it was intended to (like people being assholes sometimes). The question is do you trust/believe in Bitcoin/humanity?

It was suppose to be 1 click process. After pressing "sell" bitcoins I've got the message that on Monday I'll get my FIAT funds on my bank account &lt;- exactly the procedure as it was years ago. Back on Monday got my bitcoins back on my account and the account was locked before I've input my name into the system and provide my government ID. My account was already verified during $1000+ bitcoin ages. 
Coinbase is just a FIAT&lt;-&gt;Bitcoin whole, so take necessary precautions 
@_date: 2016-06-23 16:48:13
But I already had put my real info when I signed up for the service when only bank accounts were possible. During that time there were no other options to do so, hence why bank holder name doesn't match empty spaces. Anyway, if they couldn't process the sale last week then why not ask for more details and verified ID on the spot, there is like 3 business days before money shows up at your bank account. When I was checking coinbase account up till Monday everything was fine. Then when the huge price drop happens suddenly transaction is reversed and I can't buy and sell anymore before I verify my ID - this is not the first time I'm hearing coinbase is doing shady shit like that during roller coaster times and it's always at the expense of the customer.

@_date: 2016-06-22 22:41:06
Yes. Coinbase is a compliance government bitch. 
My recent story: just last week with 750$ price bump I wanted to cash out a few coins. They reversed the transaction on Monday cause my account name didn't match the bank account name. Plot twist, I had coinbase account from back in the day and never input my info their except the bank account to begin with. Their technical incompetence cost me a few hundreds.

This. Having understanding of how finance optimization (interest, tax rates, lease terms etc, ) work is great but risk of collapsing under debt burden is still there. Aren’t we all here waiting for FIAT money collapse under debt weight - it make sense for government to borrow more finance wise ��

Do you mean that every other browser uses the same safari engine? Yes. But there are some significant security benefits of that. Otherwise In free to use any browser and there plenty out there. 
YouTube is a 3rd party app and even if it's installed you can access YouTube via html in any app. So your statement is wrong. 
Play services is integral part of Android experience that is comparable to what you get with iOS. Android Wear doesn't work without it f.e. Pure AOSP is great for enthusiasts but compromises a lot of useful apps that rely on play services to function. Aka "closed source creep". There is a reason there projects like microG to try mitigate that, but the microG framework is still in alpha state. 
In the end, there is no difference what platform you choose, they all stuck tentacles in your pockets. Apple is guarding their customers better and doing it with less intrusion to privacy, Google on the other hand...

If the government decided to build a freeway through your backyard there are some legitimate cases where it could do so even if you against it (monopoly on violence). Since you don't support those actions you decided that you can cross the freeway anyway since you have all the right to do so (but you are not on paper). 1) Will the government be responsible for your death in the event of you got hit by a car? 2) Will the driver be blamed?
For both question answer is not. It was your decision to cross the freeway. The state is inherently "wrong" and building freeway on your property is just an example, but it can't be blamed for your own actions.

If you seen these discussions millions of times than it's time to realize that initial statement is definitely not true. 
And your example is showing an example where not the system that imposed the red light rules is to blame but rather the executioner. Unless you mean that the law is actually - if you cross the street on the red light then you and your family is executed. In this case it's a police state (history knows examples of societies like that), and in case you agreed to live in such society you are to blame for your and your family execution.
My bottom line is. If you know the rules of the game before hand and decide to play it voluntarily - nobody can blame the game for outcome specifically written in the rules anymore. And you can't blame the game at all if the player makes a choice to quit entirely.

Dude, you have trouble in comprehension. Before segregation laws exists this is what was the reality. Both blacks and whites passively agreed to what was happening (oppression of minorities). This was the System at that time. Of course there were people who made their own decision to oppose it to change it and were ready to deal with the consequences and many were "crushed". Eventually people like MLK got successful. But you seemed to not realize that they were risking everything to do the change and that's why MLK is forever will be in history.  
Currently society lives in a system without open information. Everybody passively agreeing to it. Some (wikileaks, piratebay) actively opposing status quo. This is their own decision and they should be ready to deal with the consequences, especially if they break the current law. Aaron was in this situation too.
