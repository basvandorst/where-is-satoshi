Dude i never fucking knew about overdraft fees. I always assume that if I cant cover it, tx doesnt fucking go through! This should be the standard!. I always keep like &lt; 100$ in my checking account and all my money in a savings account. At one point, i made an ebay purchase but they couldnt clear my cc, so they used my debit card instead. It went over the amount I had. The bank first refused it then covered it. The ebay purchase first got rejected so they tried to do the tx 3 times. I woke up to a 275$ fee. 
Ive never not had money but that was fucking insane. The bank would absolutely do nothing about it. Thats when I decided fuck fiat, fuck banks, and went all into crypto.

[The Lightning Network Whitepaper](
Page 55


micropayment  channels,  to  enable  7  billion  people  to  make  two  channels
per  year  with  unlimited  transactions  inside  the  channel,  it  would  require
133 MB blocks (presuming 500 bytes per transaction and 52560 blocks per
year).  Current generation desktop computers will be able to run a full node
with old blocks pruned out on 2TB of storage.
@_date: 2018-01-09 00:06:35
So tabs?
@_date: 2018-01-27 03:47:06
I wonder if you went through my history before writing that...
@_date: 2018-01-26 15:36:22
Sorry, I can't reliably get it out, at any point in time, with subcent fees.
@_date: 2018-01-29 11:26:02


How is this relevant?
@_date: 2018-01-28 21:59:13
Cause if only 1 hub, aka bank, can control the fees. LN turns into the very thing it tried to defy, visa.
@_date: 2018-01-29 22:53:20
Why don't you just buy a miner? Seems less expensive than a btc transaction  block during congestion.
@_date: 2018-01-27 01:11:58
what's bcash? better go check it out.
@_date: 2018-01-29 22:17:03

@_date: 2018-01-26 04:06:15
It's linear.
I'm sure you can fit an inverse parabola curve in there and it'd be 0.9968, doesn't make it so. 
Hell, you can make a function of 8th order, and it'd be even closer, but it's still linear.

Get rich quik skeme
@_date: 2018-01-23 22:39:20
Ok sure, lets fork bitcoin, limit the blocksize to 3 bytes. It technically doesnt NEED a blocksize increase to 1mb.

@_date: 2018-01-10 16:59:26
Well when you're trying to promote something, you dont make the other side seem better...
- Long text of complicated procedures that I didnt bother reading...
- 1 on-chain transaction.
I was sure the infograph was made by altcoins.
@_date: 2018-01-26 18:45:09
I mean, sure, treat 90% of btc userbase like this... lost 400$ cause of shit blocks, 'fuck you bye'... that's how you're going to see btc adoption.
@_date: 2018-01-11 01:24:03
Yeah but why not increase to 133MB first? Before building performance car, rent the right garage space.

@_date: 2018-01-23 14:27:32
- If higher difficulty, miners see less $$. 
- Miners see less $$, miners switch to a more profitable fork. 
- Miners switch forks, hash rate for bitcoin goes down. 
- Hash rate goes down, less tx are processed.
- Less tx/time unit = mempool clogs. 
- Mempool clogs, fees go up. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 14:39:05


Currently gigabit connection and 330TB tape drives are extremely affordable. What exactly are you waiting for?
@_date: 2018-01-22 23:22:18
Well i wasnt planning on doing any tx out of debit card... I do all my tx by cc, then when i get paid i pay cc, rest go in savings.

Lightning network is a joke and a disgrace to the community. You should be ashamed. Bitcoin was supposed to challenge banks, not join them.
@_date: 2017-12-26 02:58:20
Ofc not, what alternative is there?
@_date: 2017-12-25 22:19:19
1gb block is enough for the world population conducting 50tx/day in a single block...(imo this is already overkill, but in any case, a node that lasts several years would cost as much as 10 average btc tx fees for 330TB tape drive.) I dont know why they wanna try 1TB blocks but hey, research sometimes leads to unexpected places.
@_date: 2017-12-26 02:41:03
Thats fine with me. No fees. Insta tx. High fees = centralization because no one can tx except the ultra rich.
@_date: 2018-09-19 04:19:55
Uh, what does that have to do with anything? You know people live in other countries more than in the united states of america, yes?
@_date: 2017-12-26 04:50:40
There's already a ledger, its called opening a bank account. Second layer are a disgrace to the community.

Fair eniugh, thanks.
@_date: 2018-03-20 00:19:29


I've been extremely neutral in my comments... It just bothers me that people in this sub consider other currencies as shitcoins. It makes me think that they have a financial incentive for bitcoin to succeed. 
Personally, I don't care who succeeds, as long as currency validated by proof of work takes over. It could be bitcoin, it could be any other currency. 
Whoever has the best functionality wins.

Hate to break it to ya, but BTC is the new version of McDonald that didn't like the direction of bitcoin...
@_date: 2018-03-20 00:03:54
No no, you misunderstand me. When something forks, there is a problem with the initial code. Why did a large portion of people decide they had enough of the original code? Especially influential people that pushed bitcoin forward and that had insanely high holdings in bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-03-12 20:37:38
Lol what a shit analogy. Internet explorer is the software you use to download firefox. 
@_date: 2018-03-20 03:58:49
Thanks for your opinion! I disagree with it but I respect it. I feel like you're putting some far-in-the-future security issue above today's usage. People (well me) want something cheap and fast.


Well... yes, a hardfork is planned every few months...


I don't really understand what a node does, from my understanding, it doesn't do anything?
@_date: 2018-03-20 13:23:28
The original bitcoin, because it's the original code, minus two lines of code.
Just a year old, because it's a hardfork, so it's new, with less hashpower and awareness and support.
BTC is absolutely batshit insane to me. Segwit, segwit 2x debate, lightning network debate. Full blown out solutions with staff, money, time, energy VS 2 lines of code BCH.
It's absolutely MENTAL!
All because "moore's law might break down in the future"... I feel like this is a bad kafka novel.
@_date: 2018-03-20 11:01:50
Uh, what? What's asicboost?
@_date: 2018-03-20 04:00:01
But it is the same code... There are like 2 lines changed... Do a side by side comparison between a-&gt;b and a-&gt;a , and find out who has 2 lines changed and who has nearly all the code changed...
@_date: 2018-03-19 23:28:42
Why did bitcoin fork?
@_date: 2018-02-10 15:19:34
Yep, if blocksize &gt;115000, increase blocksize.
Bch did just that.
@_date: 2018-03-20 13:07:03
well specifically for antbleed, what do you want to do about it? I want to mine, and I haven't found plausible proof that there's anything wrong with my gear...


Dude its like less than a year old... Give it time...
@_date: 2018-03-21 21:45:40
Well it was programmed that way to defend against a 51% attack. You can fork bitcoin, change the line of code to make it mineable on your potato raspberry pi, and super inflate it. See how far that gets you!
@_date: 2018-03-19 21:19:47
I'm impressed at how good you sound while conveying no actual information.
Do you know why the bitcoin fork happened? Because bitcoin is literally a company with a marketing arm.
@_date: 2018-03-20 00:10:42
Honestly man, if I was rich AF, all I'd want would be a status quo. If anything, roger is a fanatic. Like him or not, he truly believes in what he pushes. He risked his insanely large holdings on ideology. That's nothing if not worthy of respect, whether you agree with his ideology or not.

Dude blocksyream can literally do a developper 51% attack and kill bitcoin. Its dangerous af.
@_date: 2018-03-20 13:59:31


From what I understand, a node is just a witness to the network, with no actual power. Only miners have power. You need like 3 independent nodes worldwide to make the network secure. Right now, there are 5000+. We could cut down on 4997 nodes and it would still be just as secure.
@_date: 2018-02-12 20:44:56
Well the graph proves his point... 
@_date: 2018-02-07 22:44:57
Bitcoin IS roger ver. It wouldn't be worth more than sub cents without ver/wu.
@_date: 2018-03-20 11:44:23
I mean... If bitmain goes offline, btc is dead. Not like slow, just dead. Nothing can come close to keeping up the hashpower.
Antbleed is most likely fake. Looked into it before mining, the fix is some shady .exe that im not touching with a 10foot pole...
@_date: 2018-02-10 15:08:29
Nope, its called bch.
@_date: 2018-02-07 18:36:29
Exactly. Its a clone of btc before segwit...
@_date: 2018-02-10 14:44:43
What? Newton is dead. Physics and calculus still alive.
@_date: 2018-03-19 23:30:57
Dude bitcoin is forked every month. You're just pissed at bch cause it's worth something and all the other shit isn't worth anything. And you know the only reason they say it's bitcoin is because it's the original code they forked off before btc made changes to the code. 
@_date: 2018-02-07 13:53:50
Except its not the first? Bitcoin without segwit is the first... By that definition, bch's code, being more authentic than btc, should just be called bitcoin, because its the original/first code.
@_date: 2018-03-20 02:23:14
Here's how I see it.
This is signaled:
A (btc) -&gt;B (segwit)
Some people go: Oh shit, what the fuck?
Some people hardfork A, to keep it intact:
A (btc) -&gt; A (bch)
Now the original A goes:
A (btc) -&gt; B (segwit)
Which chain is now most compatible with genesis? I kept A-&gt;A because it's the same code.
@_date: 2018-02-07 13:24:21
Isnt the only reason bitcoin is successful is because it has bitcoin in the name?
@_date: 2018-03-12 20:38:33
@_date: 2018-02-07 13:29:59
Lol no one is tricked... Traded in my btc for bch on day 1.
@_date: 2018-02-26 21:31:00
Ya ok im gonna sue myself for 1 gazillion toys. -.- this is retarded

We'll also never be able to achieve 1mb ram if you ask microsoft.
@_date: 2018-02-07 13:52:29
Well say I have 1btc, I therefore also have 1 bch. Then I traded my 1 btc for 13 bch. So I would then have 0btc and 14 bch.
@_date: 2018-03-19 23:32:39

@_date: 2018-02-10 04:45:09
There is only one bitcoin developer, satoshi nakamoto. There is no blocksize issue with him.

    maxblocksize = largerlimit

@_date: 2018-03-20 02:52:21
ugh i never talked about bch until you brought it up. All I said initially was that op was disingenuous because he is putting his financial interests on a pedestal when representing all the people of his region. I had a bad day man, why make it worse?
