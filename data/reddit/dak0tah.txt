yes, if the system were changed things would change.
but in the current system, it's simple to behave in a manner that makes browsing better for everyone, as long as you're informed.
this is true for many avenues of life. if congress would just get along, if corporations would quit being greedy, if religious nutjobs have sudden epiphanies as to the errors of their ways, but the ***fact*** is that here we are.
and for an educated person, there's usually a way to act that works within the current paradigm. it's often less than ideal, but, again, here we are.

Then they're not making any extra money from Bitcoin inflation. If they're saving a small percentage in fees, then, like I said in my first comment, their attitude is to make 1% more profits instead of encouraging more people to use BTC.
In this situation, BTC is good for the business, not necessarily the consumer.

OP seems to think that Overstock is accepting BTC as a means of furthering the goals of BTC. However, I believe that Overstock is trying to further its own goals. They don't give a shit if customers have a reason to use BTC, but if someone wants to pay using it, hey, what they hell.

Because this isn't just a one-day website, these posts will be here pretty much for a long time. If anyone wants to look up examples of banking corruption in relation to BTC in the future, they will not find this post, pure and simple, because OP is a tool. Including relevant keywords in the Title allows for the Reddit search to properly index it and makes the long-term user experience that much better.
A good analogy is reaction gifs, while not as serious a topic. If you're looking for a specific GIF of a character from a certain show doing something, it's almost impossible to find because any post linking to it is titled something random like "GRW I learned all froot loops are the same flavor and just different colors again". And that's not really a problem because GIFs are srs bsns.
But with something that actually matters in a grander scheme of things, such as current global economic factors and events, it would be nice if posts were archived and orginized and not posted by 12 year olds with MS paint trying to get on the front page of Reddit for the first time.
Sorry for the rant, but *the more you know*...

Or have another source of income that uses a different currency and pays your real world bills. BTC would be more like disposable income that lets you afford drugs.

Yeah. But it makes you wonder how often this happens, that not only would it go to an actual "in-use" address, but that it would be a Redditor who wanted to post it. Many unnoticed or unreported incidents of this could have happened. Or, you know, coincidence.

If I had more BTC, I would give you RedditGold for this comment.

Welcome to the discussion. We're all newbs.
I was being half sarcastic, yeah a big part of BTC is independence from banks but a security deposit box is still probably one of the safest storage places accessible to the general public.
What you described is a solid plan, it's just, who is really doin that right now? Until more people get robbed, I think people are generally going to be pretty lax about their wallet security.

You need to lead with a meme and then get to the dry and boring. Or put the dry and boring bits on image macros themselves.

Thanks to Reddit tips, I had *almost* 8 entire US dollars. Now it has degraded to less than 5. It's as if my life were a sham...
@_date: 2013-04-12 19:47:23
Well, that's why I put it in parenthesis. But, for certain people, if BTC was stable to a degree, even dealing with unreliable prices could just be chalked up as the cost of doing business.
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:48:51
I love memes. I think they can often convey a complicated message simply and eloquently. Of course, this isn't always true but that's why there's a downvote arrow.
Their most important role is to promote discussion and inclusivity by sharing easy-to-digest information with the masses, ***NOT*** to replace conversation altogether.
@_date: 2013-12-01 21:06:07
I thought memes got banned.

A picture of a bank statement with account numbers/names/physical address blacked out showing the transfer from MtGox would be awesome.

My small business uses the Paypal smartphone adapter to process credit cards. It's awesome, gets great reception even on bad networks, runs quickly, has no minimum purchase requirement, accepts Visa, MasterCard, Discover, and American Express, and puts the money directly in our Paypal account after taking the 2.something % fees.
However, as long as we put company purchases directly on our Paypal debit card, we collect 5% cash back, thus negating ALL fees. If BitCoin can do all of this, we would consider the switch, but Paypal has been invaluable in taking our business to the next level.

I can't say this point enough. Just because the original post is a meme, doesn't mean it's lolbad. Image macros are excellent for conveying an idea on numerous levels and instigating the conversation.

Haha, as someone determined to build a small-fortune in BTC without ever depositing other currency, I am now fantasizing about creating like, a dozen wallets and just spamming the shit out of all these sites all day every day. I wonder what kind of return-on-time I would see.
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:24:46
Okay, yes, if that is the only flaw, utilizing ''1337 text sp33k" keeps it simple enough to remember IMO.
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:08:32
It's an attack? I thought..but..deflation..
Is that what took MtRed down?
@_date: 2013-11-11 18:48:16
Oh yes, I see the novelty advantage. And I never meant to seem against it, but OP seemed to think BTC could completely replace Paypal and that just currently is not true.
Due to industry regulation, our products are currently sold exclusively at farmers markets. When we are dealing in online orders soon, I very much plan to accept BTC.

What I've always wondered about that strip, perhaps you could clarify, is wouldn't it be safer to still replace some letters with numbers or something?
Isnt "Runn1ngW1thSc1ss0rs" just a better password than "RunningWithScissors"? Something to do with compound dictionaries or whatnot?

IMO if a buyer/seller relationship exists in BTC with both parties owning and retaining their currency, any "volatile" fluctuations shouldn't be observed as impeding. Over the long term, both parties realize that any real, stable, growth in the value of a BTC would be akin to inflation/deflation.
Of course, this only really works in ideal circumstances, ie the buyer is a miner or BTC merchant themselves, not even concerned with its "FOREX" value (am I using that term properly?) because they are involved in an effectively closed circuit economy, and the seller also keeps their assets tied up in BTC, choosing to buy other products and services at fixed (or variable, really) BTC prices from BTC merchants.
In that situation, no matter what speculation driven USD conversions occur, their little barter system runs smoothly.
Edit: I accidentally a word.
@_date: 2013-12-08 01:50:37
That's interesting actually, do they take credit cards through their mobile app with the same 1% fee or flat fee?

If our Bitcoin sales are hugely successful, we may adopt that model, but at first it will be primarily a publicity &amp; experimental thing. Part of the novelty is that people can public ally view how much money we have.

Interesting point about the starting price. If it stabilizes anywhere below $100USD, any newcomer looking at the history of BTC from the perspective of CNBC will think it is losing value, not understanding what occurred over the month before record keeping began.
