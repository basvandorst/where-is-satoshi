@_date: 2016-04-26 20:46:03
BtcTrade.com might have some answers on how this happened!

This is a visualization of real time bitcoin transactions. you can see the live version here: 
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:59:43
Yeah it's mining Monero using coinhive API. I'm doing a research on the browser mining epidemic. If anyone has more evidence of such use cases please let me know. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 02:33:10
The service would be your browser process. Depending on the API that website is using you can search for that script, these days most commonly coinhive is being used so you can search for `coinhive.min.js` or just `coinhive` on the website's source code to see if that code exist. unfortunately some websites are using obfuscation methods to make it harder to identify such scripts. 
Although if you opened up a webpage and your cpu usage went up for the period of time you are visiting that website, there's the possibility that a miner script exists. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:00:08
When you load dailyblockchain webpage, it starts to load the transactions as they happen. So if there are multiple lines from what you already have in the screen with the transactions that just appear (yellow) that means they are related transactions.
as for the second time, I manually followed a bunch of unconfirmed transactions and noticed those chains. will send txhash if I can find them now  
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:57:57
yeah that I believe is this transaction: 
It looks like a massive coinjoin. not sure exactly. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 11:49:42
It's a bit tricky though. Sometimes it's just high traffic on the network. One reason I assumed this could be spam attack was that a lot of outputs are being spent as soon as the previous transaction is broadcasted. Also looking at the mempool and recent unconfirmed transactions there are more chained transactions than normal. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:16:54
Interesting, it seems like they are using segwit addresses (on the screenshot) so if that is the case no that is not it.
But I can't deny that the whole thing could be a massive coin join with more than 2000 BTC. which in characteristics is the same as most common spam attacks

There are for sure lots of automated transactions going on! if you check the new transactions like this one:  for sure you can see that the fee amount and the value of the transaction is within a "for-loop".

I've been following the Stress test block by block today and also monitoring our BTM network transactions, so far there has been no issues, maybe some long confirmations time on some transactions with couple of inputs but that is not a problem from the BTM side as there are 5K+ unconfirmed transactions in the mempool as of now (I saw the peak of 11.5K not sure if it went higher than that)
oh btw, I'm the Blockchain engineer at BitAccess :)
@_date: 2015-06-19 01:36:46
BitAccess offers better solution (at least cost-wise) also the support is one of the best in Bitcoin ATM companies.
@_date: 2015-06-30 21:44:57
this is not normal transactions, it's a DoS attack on blockchain. not sure if it's a planned stress test though, I haven't seen anything for one today.
@_date: 2015-06-30 21:47:02
what happens to those transactions then? double spend attempts would have more chances to succeed.

it's mostly wallet management issue or how the wallet does the indexing of the transactions
@_date: 2015-06-23 03:53:08
I assume something went wrong before broadcasting, that being said, if you were using blockchain.info, today they weren't really synced, there was the updated block details on the homepage but if you searched a recent tx hash you couldn't find it, however it was indexed as unconfirmed in chain.com or blockr.io

@_date: 2014-12-19 22:36:37
I think the best approach would be to have a Bitcoin ATM in a cafe or some other place rather than the airport. It would be less problematic and probably less contacts are needed. also as you might need to check on the ATM once in a while (cash dispensary  or ...), airport would be far out of reach.
I've been doing BTC/IRR exchange for a while now and I guess having an ongoing exchange that has representatives in Iran might be a better approach.

@_date: 2015-01-25 02:40:15
I'm not sure if I was the first one or not, but as I was watching the transactions, I couldn't find any patterns or signs of a automated play before mine. I'm the guy who made this: 
I ran the script for 1 night and got (0.2 BTC) and donated back half of them to the Sarutobi pot.
I guess the developer should work on another method of checking the unique requests from within the game. I'm developing one and might as well go open source with the whole project. In case anyone's interested shoot me a message.

@_date: 2015-01-26 18:15:29
These same rules that should have limited the government are the ones that make normal people lives much harder in these times, having no access to international credit cards, or paypal or the ability to receive or send money, would not make anything harder for the government that has his own oil reserve but the people living their normal life.
My plan to is to introduce Bitcoin to the average people that could really use it to have a better quality of life.

I'm not really up for the idea for the bitcoin to go anywhere near mainstream now because of the same reason that you said! it's so fragile for now, but it's working for some purposes so far.
So meanwhile instead of doing all these stress tests for god knows why, make something good out of your coding skills, or at least prove the point and let others fix the things that "you", as in the spammer, highlighted in your "stress test report" if any. and test other stuff on testnet, that is why it's there!
and also it's possible to crash lots of industries (maybe local) with that kind of money, but should you? 
and no one begged, I could run multiple instances of 24/7 spamming bots on blockchain for months, but should I?
@_date: 2015-08-27 00:48:02

@_date: 2015-07-07 04:04:10
it just makes the transactions confirm really late, if normally it would take around 10 minutes now make it 3 hours and that's a maybe depends on your luck.
the big difference is the ratio, transactions per seconds. on this stress test we peaked 147 transactions/second, bitcoin network is still young for this many users.

C'mon guys mine! mine! mine!
@_date: 2015-07-07 01:43:27
I had 3000 bits splitted in 3000 0.0001 BTC inputs that needed to send to another address and multibit crashed all the time, sometimes the app itself didn't crash but it would not broadcast the transaction to the network and I had to resync the whole database that is a PITA!
@_date: 2015-07-26 17:14:39
I Agree. But for one join it still possible to find some of the inputs belonging to the entity that entered the coinjoin,
like for the transaction mentioned in this thread, one example would be this: 
that you can say the inputs belong to the same entity who holds the private key of these two addresses:
1PY7aLsHTeWM3LJzhVHvWv5ogX7Ts2o7pK 
@_date: 2015-07-07 02:04:08
just a few wallets let the user manage the fees, and even if you did I bet you wouldn't go higher than 0.0002 or 0.0003 that still made not that much difference, at least for me didn't! took around 2 hours to get confirmation on some of the transactions
@_date: 2015-07-28 03:48:47
you can use all other insight instances (e.g chain.localbitcoins.com) to load balance your queries.
specially because when I tried to get closure of a bitcoin address that had more than 10 addresses, it kinda failed due to API issues.
Request URL:
Request Method:GET
Status Code:504 Gateway Time-out
Nice work though! take a look at Bitiodine.net too!
@_date: 2015-07-26 16:35:57
yes this would be the exception of this rule because there are multiple layers of coinjoin on each input. but still if you go back any transaction you might end up in some transaction that still follow this rule and that is where coinjoin will fail.
e.g if you back follow: 1Lfb7kSwrQe8Q76kBedZwdmSoZxCiz4tAZ (1.1 BTC - Output)
you'd see that the previous transaction reveals some other addresses belonging to one entity: 
but some other inputs have used multiple coinjoins in a row so it would be much harder to follow

I think there are enough proof now, there's no need for ongoing stress tests 
@_date: 2015-07-06 19:53:18
depending on which block your transactions were included in. If on both, nothing would change, but if your transaction is included in the orphaned blocks and not on the longest valid chain (after the fork is resolved) , you can reuse those coins!
@_date: 2015-07-26 19:34:11
yes I meant 1PY and 14U are the same, 1Lf would be the input address for the coinjoin.
I'm starting this blockchain forensic 101 to just talk about some random and basic things that might be interesting to people who are interested in blockchain analysis.

@_date: 2015-07-28 03:54:01
what these tools do is get all the transactions of each address and follow this rule to find closure addresses : 
after this step it might help to use some machine learning algorithms to maybe learn some more details about cluster of addresses or ....

If this is not April fools shenanigans, I wish I was closer to Berlin... :) 
@_date: 2015-07-26 16:20:35
coinjoin uses this rule to confuscate the path bitcoins are moving so that's why they could succeed in some extent.
Still the reason I used "Entity" and not a person or software is that at the time being for that transaction the "Entity" would be the group of people that are using an instance of coinjoin

@_date: 2015-07-07 03:56:21
from the view of services and infrastructures that run on the bitcoin protocol it does, there are tons of edge cases that no one thought of, just because of the stress test, the fact that there was 7 orphaned blocks for the first time is also a variable here (
@_date: 2015-07-26 16:37:29
multisig is another story in the sense that there are multiple inputs (addresses) involved in each input. these would be for later on bitcoin forensics 101 tips :)
@_date: 2015-07-06 20:10:42
one thing is there's not a few transactions, I have more than 10 transactions that needs to get confirmed for the last 1.5 hours for me to be able to continue my work, but haven't yet.
also if you check out  3,4 posts in each page are people complaining about their unconfirmed transactions from 3,4 hours ago.
but agreed on the fact that there are too much bureaucracy on bitcoin dev now and not that much action.
@_date: 2016-09-29 22:33:29
if you check any bitcoin testnet explorer(e.g   you'd see that there are blocks after blocks coming in within seconds. This could be due to difficulty reset on testnet, however as you see on the chart above the hashing rate on testnet had a boost today so that means some entity is running some hardcore ASICS on testnet for some reason.
And basically this acts like a DDoS on all testnet-enabled nodes. for example blockcypher API shows that it crashed 2 hours ago and there hasn't been any new blocks on their node ( 
@_date: 2016-09-30 17:57:04
Interesting that we noticed that almost at the same time : 
The difficulty reset is one thing, the peaked hashrate is another. "block storm" is a good word to describe it ;)
@_date: 2015-04-22 13:34:41
can you send me a screenshot of that?
@_date: 2015-04-22 14:13:22
is it happening all the time? I can't replicate the problem even on 3G it always loads the amounts from the server:
but even if you don't see the amount, it does not matter as everything would happen on the server side, you can send your reward request anyhow.

game development is not my thing so maybe you're right....! anyways wish a happy promising life
@_date: 2015-04-22 13:31:01
I can check on the logs, are you sure you did all the 50 levels?
cause on android what some people did were that they played till level 49, backup their application folder and played the last level got the reward, restore the saved folder and played it again.
that error that you saw was a result of some checks that flagged your request as an Invalid one.
do you when about it was? and to what bitcoin address you requested the reward?
@_date: 2015-04-27 14:04:49
we don't have anything as reset diff, if no block has been found in 20 minutes, the difficulty automatically resets back to the minimum for a single block, after which it returns to its previous value.
@_date: 2015-04-13 19:56:08
blocktrail explorer was probably broken because of this fork, I tweeted(  them about this and they just fixed it, check out their explorer now it's adding 2 blocks a second lol it's actually looking cool with their notifications

It's resolved! they've already paid most of the withdrawals e.g.

@_date: 2015-04-13 19:56:57
it will fix itself soon, probably lots of block explorers are broken till someone resyncs the indexes, but all the miners will come to a consensus on the longest block soon

no, probably you checked the unconfirmed input's low mining fee that made the whole chain of unconfirmed transaction.
if you check  with the fee of 27 sat/byte it should be confirmed in average of 12 minutes.
@_date: 2015-04-13 19:10:05
yes cause it kind of breaks all kind of transactions... it all depends on which fork end up to be the main one!

lol yeah of course there could be issue, when you do indie game development you need the test users to figure out the bugs and report. there is no scam in this, the game is free and was being downloaded even before the bitcoin tipping was added. this is a feature, I'm not getting anything from you that could make the whole thing as a scam.
Thanks for those who reported the bugs in a respectful manner and sent screenshots for me to be able to come up with the solutions.

the mempool is flooded with transactions with low fees and the mining pools chose the ones with higher fees first, so although this transaction is not in nature a dust transaction, fee was it queues in the same group as the dust transactions going on now on the stress test. mempool is at its lowest number of transactions today at around 23K transactions

@_date: 2015-09-02 13:31:48
it takes some time, let the mempool get to have 50K+ transaction, with the fees included so far I know it will be felt (already on 25K transactions there are 16 BTC in fees)

there's nothing wrong with the outgoing transaction from the BTM, when the transaction was sent out there was not that much confirmed inputs summing up to 6.4121095 BTC requested. 
The transaction was broadcasted at 2015-09-16 19:02:07, let's see how much input was available before that time:
(there are some after 19:03:49 that I won't list as they are after the time of the requested transaction)
2015-09-16 14:14:33  0.56437674 BTC
2015-09-16 14:14:33  0.28218837 BTC
2015-09-16 14:14:33  0.14109418 BTC
2015-09-16 14:14:33  0.14109418 BTC
2015-09-16 14:14:33  1.12875349 BTC
2015-09-15 15:05:11  0.90713919 BTC
2015-09-15 14:44:05  0.09725527 BTC
2015-09-12 20:00:23  0.17633574 BTC
2015-09-12 19:40:52  0.09037053 BTC
total: 2.52860769 BTC
If you have a solution for that situation, I would really like to know.

(~27 sat/byte) mining fee that is higher than the average mining fees
@_date: 2015-04-22 18:57:33
have you ever done any production level programming in a team? 
there's no blame to pass, you just have to find the guy who is responsible to fix the bug, we're trying to do something here and believe me with the tips we already gave (and also some "hackers" that got more than 1 round of tipping in the beginning) we're negative on the profit... 
@_date: 2015-09-17 04:29:56
The way proper bitcoin atms work is that they use an (often more than one) exchange to refill their hotwallet for the bitcoins they sell. and [this transaction]( used an [input]( that was sent out of a 3rd party exchange to the btm that used really low mining fee (0.00008617 BTC, [~3sat/byte]( and with the current stress test it might take a while to confirm.
It seems like it did what a BTM is suppose to do

you're money is safe, but keep the receipt just in case, I'm sure it will be resolved someway or another:)
@_date: 2015-04-27 03:43:00
it should be average of 10 mins, but testnet has this magic thing that could restart the difficulty to 1 sometimes. not sure if this is the case this time, but 2 weeks ago that happened and someone started mining with an ASIC and mined ~8000 blocks in 1 day.
the thing is most of the block explorers would break when they get to something like this... and this is where the issue is and not the attack on the testnet.
@_date: 2015-04-22 15:23:15

There would be a path from the address you sent the coins from (here would be A) and the coins in the last address (D). however what most of the bitcoin tumblers do, is that they mix lots of inputs with lots of transactions so it would be impossible to figure out the connection between those two coins

I guess this might ruin the chips so the recovery might be impossible after that. I guess my last resort is to give it to some data recovery company, they need to get the chips out of the board and get a image dump from them

@_date: 2015-10-02 03:46:21
I totally agree. however, if you add more keys meaning hierarchical (sequence) signing order, there are some edge cases that cannot generate valid signatures, so basically would fail depending on the design of the application. The reason is the script involved in the transaction is just a stack, best explained in [bitcoin.org]( :




    OP_0 &lt;A sig&gt; &lt;B sig&gt; OP_2 &lt;A pubkey&gt; &lt;B pubkey&gt; &lt;C pubkey&gt; OP_3


    Sig Stack       Pubkey Stack  (Actually a single stack)
    ---------       ------------
    B sig           C pubkey
    A sig           B pubkey
    OP_0            A pubkey










    OP_0 &lt;B sig&gt; &lt;A sig&gt; OP_2 &lt;A pubkey&gt; &lt;B pubkey&gt; &lt;C pubkey&gt; OP_3
    Sig Stack       Pubkey Stack  (Actually a single stack)
    ---------       ------------
    A sig           C pubkey
    B sig           B pubkey
    OP_0            A pubkey

@_date: 2016-05-13 00:48:59
it's basically impossible, but the fact that this guy is spamming all  with the same message is unknown...
@_date: 2015-11-05 19:00:43
thanks, yeah I thought you might have some information on the address
@_date: 2015-10-08 18:02:07
last spam attack in mid-september was almost identical to this one, in the sense that coinwallet.eu leaked the private key to these addresses that each had hundreds of dust inputs (~ 0.00001) and everyone was trying to make transactions to get them, so there were multiple double spend attempts. at the end what solved the issue was burning the inputs in miner's fee and using OP_return to have to outputs, this way miner's tend to mine these transactions rather than 100input-1output transactions with the same inputs as the other one.

It's a free game that tips a portion of the pot when the player finishes the game (50 levels). 1 in-app purchase to remove ads, and that's all, nothing really complicated :)
I found this a funny fact that you have to mention "Apple is not involved(sponsored) Bitcoin tips".
@_date: 2015-10-20 05:03:02
add it to blockchain and carry on ... :)
@_date: 2015-10-18 19:03:12
not really suitable for big scale, it needs a custom node to handle tons of simultaneous requests that I think is the block explorer API job. we should not all redo everything, it should be possible to build on top of other services and be sure they are reliable.

I've donated $80 worth of bitcoin for starter, will hope there'd be some donations but I doubt it. will try to chip in when the ad revenue reaches a threshold.
The tipping model is different than Sarutobi so I have to wait and see what will happen when people start finishing the game and getting the rewards, so far I had about 4 or 5 winners.
I find it really hard to get downloads on Google Play. it's much easier to get first round of downloads on AppStore and wait for the network effect :)

I finally gave this to a data-recovery company. But I received another SSD with almost the same problem, this is what I did.
1. I used a 3.5" HDD Hard Drive SATA IDE Converter Adapter + Power Cable OTB ( and a mSATA to SATA convertor (
This way I could disconnect the power or data cable as I wish.
the thing that finally worked was connecting the power first and the data cable last, it was recognized by the computer.
2. the drives were not mountable even on linux so I used ddrescue to image the drive. It was failing in  random places so I had to repeat this for some time till I could get a complete image.
3. the image was corrupted so I had to run fsck to scan the image and fix the orphaned inodes (fsck.ext3 -y ./image.dd)
4. now I was able to mount the drive but lots of files were corrupted, but this is the closest you can get to recover the data.
@_date: 2015-03-09 20:30:33
I've tried  nothing in BIOS regarding the drive

I'm doing lots of Blockchain analytics/analysis with different set of tools, mostly for fun. However visualizing the transactions shows some interesting characteristics of each site or let's say wallet management.
Mostly these might be meaningless in short run, it needs further analysis and maybe somehow applying machine learning clusterings to see if it's possible to figure out what is the backend algorithm for a wallet management.
As you mentioned "predetermined transactions", these patterns are the things that distinguish automated transactions with normal ones.

I've worked on a game that rewards user with Bitcoins (about 3 USD or so for the first winners) when you finish the game, It has been rejected by Apple 4 times now, every time a different reason. I'm going to submit the latest update by tonight and hope it gets approved.
the Android version is out though, check it out and let me know what you think:

some of the issues Bitcoin ATMs have are related to the lack of a reliable block explorer API: 
@_date: 2015-10-18 18:35:35
yeah blocktrail seems to be working fine recently
@_date: 2015-10-18 18:47:43
maybe the wording for "legit" blockexplorers was not the best, but the fact is we need reliable and stable blockchain explorer APIs for bitcoin applications to work.
and so far I haven't seen any that i could say it has 100% uptime.
blocktrail is doing good after their last updates so far, blockcypher is also good, but they are still not quite perfect yet
and for those who say run a node, yeah it's ok to run a node for everyday use of a single person or a really simple app, but for bigger scale it's not possible to handle all the requests with one single node and having a cluster of nodes is too much hassle for a small team to handle other stuff too, that is were blockchain explorer APIs come in and should work fine
@_date: 2015-03-09 20:27:22
the boot up process is ok with a USB stick, the problem is that I don't have access to this SSD that holds the keys
@_date: 2015-02-10 00:42:47
The paper was written around 4 months ago and the focus was more on the available tools for users. Most of these techniques would be more usable if new technologies such as BIP32 is added to them but might have security issues.
This is just the first look at the usability of Bitcoin clients in academic, hope that it motivates people to start working on these issues and have great proposals in the near future
@_date: 2015-03-29 22:30:12

lol, ok wait and see the game in less than a week. don't want to spoil the idea.
@_date: 2017-07-26 17:52:50
I doubt there's a full connection between inputs and outputs there. it seems unlikely, mostly because outputs from the coldstorage mostly seems to be regular addresses, but inputs for the address you posted are all multisig. Do you have a way to backup this?
@_date: 2015-02-21 08:46:00
how did you calculate 0.20?
@_date: 2015-02-25 20:03:43
No it's a one time reward when player finishes the game. If this goes well I have plans to offer this as a service for other game developers.
I don't like the idea to keep the players busy with never ending levels and give them small amount of rewards for that. Personally I like games that have endings, and would be pretty happy if I get a real reward when the game finishes :) so basically I'm trying to build my ideal game model.
@_date: 2015-11-27 21:54:09
I'm pretty sure it is.

The Bitcoin reward distribution versus the number of winners is shown in this graph.
with the assumption that there would be no donations while there are 100 winners. of course the rewards would increase if the available funds in the pot increases.

@_date: 2015-10-18 18:59:21
I forgot to mention, the ones that offer APIs. from your list only blockcypher offers API that works fine now but it is not perfect.
blockexplorer.com is just an instance of insight that is far from perfect API:

@_date: 2015-02-02 00:42:07
Just for some insights here is the distribution of the rewards depending on when you win the game:
I will put around 100$ worth of bitcoin in the pot when the game is released.
@_date: 2015-02-25 19:18:47
Thanks, hope you like it.

This is in case no one donates to the pot while 100 first people win the game. of course if someone donates the reward is going to be higher .

Bitcoin ATMs may offer a more convenient way to convert your money as you go. 
@_date: 2015-10-19 05:35:32
with all due respect to chain.com guys, their API is acting super weird lately, their notification endpoint sends confirmed (100+ confirmations) transactions as a new transaction with 0 confirmation and new blocks keep getting stuck and some more
@_date: 2015-10-20 01:55:45
the best way to see is to email their support and wait for a reply... 
@_date: 2015-02-16 06:03:52
- Lots of developers using real bitcoin network for testing purposes with micro transactions
- more and more places accept bitcoin and they generate a new address for each transaction
- just more users everyday

It sure is a great day!
@_date: 2015-03-26 02:12:38
lol, that wouldn't be a bet then. 
I just like to see it confirmed because it is the first multi-sig transaction I did from ground up, I coded every part of it, from address generation to multisig address, signing and all the rest, just used blockr.io push tx api to broadcast it.
@_date: 2015-02-20 22:57:06
@_date: 2015-02-10 00:45:09
I got some interesting questions after the presentation, One asked what is my suggestion for the metaphors in the future, to be more close to traditional currencies or words such as signing (for send). My reply was that we don't know what would suit best, either we have to educate users to be more familiar with these words (that might take too much time) or try to use the metaphors in better contexts to suit the use. 
anyhow this is an open usability problem 
@_date: 2015-02-25 19:49:54
I donated 80$ worth of bitcoin to start the pot, any donations is welcome and it will increase the reward amount for everyone.
Also if I see the pot is draining, I'd try to boost it with some ad revenue.
The main point is to have a fun Bitcoin faucet that gives out some good amount of bitcoins, so if there are donations it would help more people to have some bitcoins to play with.
So far we had 1 winner that he got 0.01320642 BTC, that is a good amount for starter :)
@_date: 2015-02-20 22:57:59
I started with 80$ worth of bitcoin and donation as always are welcome.
I'd add more funds to the pot when the ad revenue reaches 50$ or so.
@_date: 2015-02-03 19:30:32

Everyone's overwhelmed by the amount of support request these days. It kind of make sense as non-crypto people have rushed to invest in DA BLOCKCHAIN and they have no clue how things work, so they end up sending support tickets if their transaction is not confirmed and such.
Even though I haven't got any response from their support in the last month, they finally did work on my request. I'm just giving them another chance. 
@_date: 2015-02-10 00:46:59
it's really hard to describe GPG to normal users, these are real usability issues that has not been solved with public key cryptography for almost a decade.
Bitcoin now introduced new usage for PKC, but still needs more study and work on the usability.
