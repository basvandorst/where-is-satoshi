Did you upload ID information? I remember having an issue with that part of it when I tried to set mine up...

I will kick him dead ass in the shin (hard) for .05 
On the real, though... I’m with you.  Seems like some shady shit is going on behind the scenes.

How about this... You HODL until 20K, at which point you send me 5%of what you earned since this post had you have sold. If it drops below 10k before it reaches 20K I will send you 10% of my entire holdings. Pinky swear.

In coinbase it gives the opton to copy address under the QR code. When you paste it should appear as the text adress

How much you bought at whatever price you bought it at has nothing to do with the price it sells for. The current market value at the point of selling at that moment is what you would receive.

I've purchased from coinbase with credit / debit card and received instantly. I've also bought (before I knew there was a difference) with my linked bank account and it took over a week. While that does suck, the price / amount of Bitcoin IS locked in at time of purchase and does not fluctuate at all.

Today was more sad for you than when you got scammed out of an entire Bitcoin last year?

Yes..  saw that above and am going to check it out tonight. Even having as little as I do it’s forcing me to educate myself more and more.  Trying not to get overwhelmed by all the available info and ins and outs of crypto, but this community is helping tons... thanks for the heads up and taking the time, it’s appreciated..

I agree, it doesn’t take much to get interested.
My $15 investment has soooared to $18 lol... got in last week before the fun stuff happened. Plan on a few Uber rides a week going straight into my Coinbase account!
