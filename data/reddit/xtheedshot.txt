He somehow received a delivery  for that address with this info.

You’re right. I’ll try that tomorrow. That’s what I’m trying to do too with this. And most importante I think alert people not to fall like I did.

So, long story short. This guy was selling a gpu on OLX ( Portuguese sales website) and I contacted him to talk about details. He send me the purchase invoice with their name and address to prove that was real. He said that would only accepted bitcoin as a payment method ( at the time I though that would not be a problem. Later we agreed that I would pay half now and half after, when I receive it. Since then I’ve made the payment and it’s been 2 days and no sign of him.  RIP

It happen in Portugal for an amount of ~250€. The only information that I have that I can connect with him is his phone number (currently turn off) Name and address.

Luckily it was not hundreds of thousands of dollares ( in my case euro). But it was a significant amount of money for me.. Yes I know that would not happen.

Not yet. I don’t think that they will care about this and if they do it will take moths ( or even years!).

I do. And an address too. ( at this point I don’t know if their legit or fake but my bet is that they are real. )
