Reddit is completely useless and buggy af i‘m sorry can‘t even delete 
@_date: 2017-12-16 17:12:45
Yes however the technology isn´t really working ATM.
That´s why it is a bubble. You can´t really do transactions with Bitcoin like it was planned, only store money using it like for example Gold.
People don´t buy Bitcoin for the technology and that´s a big issue.

@_date: 2017-12-21 14:57:06
Even when doing Segwit transactions the fees are way to high
@_date: 2017-12-19 17:23:13
Fuck the miners ? In the End the users control the system. Just fork it and create a different chain.
@_date: 2017-12-21 14:43:50
What you probably don‘t get: we can switch to a working (maybe slightly more centralized system but still ok) System and when lightning works (if it will ever work) we can then implement it.
It is absolutely ok to use a system with bigger blocks for the time lightning is still a research project. We can at any time switch to the better system if we get the technology.
@_date: 2017-12-21 13:15:54
Everyone is trying to sell their Bitcoin at the moment. With a fee that small if will probably not confirm the next months. Transactions reach to a couple of hundred dollars
@_date: 2017-12-21 14:56:07
Not enough IMO
@_date: 2017-12-16 18:00:34
Thanks for the great discussion. Idiot. You are just like that fucking Trump retard
@_date: 2017-12-24 09:13:50
No it‘s about the transaction not the coin/ wallet 
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:59:54
Maybe it‘s better in the long run. But it makes Bitcoin completely unusable for the time being.
Why not include short term solutions and undo them once lightning is ready ?
@_date: 2017-12-19 17:03:29
At the end it states there is hope, what about that ?
@_date: 2017-12-21 14:40:47
Bitcoin can not possibly grow or reach mainstream adoption at the moment. Either you are rich (in BTC or Dollar) or you can‘t use it. I‘m not, so I‘m out of it (since I actually want to use it and not speculate)
@_date: 2017-12-21 13:32:45
No they are not taking profit, it is pretty clear that the money is flowing into the altcoins. Nobody knows what will happen. I like to actually use my coins so I sold all my Bitcoin. Maybe they will soon implement Lightning, maybe not. Altcoins are working, Bitcoin not. I will switch back once Lightning works. I think this is becoming quite a popular opinion.
@_date: 2017-12-19 17:21:56
Do you think they´ll maybe change their opinion ?
You mean Bitcoin Cash ? Why do you think it´s shitty ?
I like Ethereum the most at the moment but I would think solving Bitcoins issues would be great for the overall development (since it´s most recognized)
@_date: 2017-12-19 17:25:24
The miners shouldn‘t control the system, that‘s what I‘m about
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:57:21
Because governments could make Bitcoin illegal + I need money to invest in Altocins because the Bitcoins Devs don‘t push innovation that much
@_date: 2017-12-19 17:26:31
Could you explain why you prefer them ? (Over Ethereum or Bcash )
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:00:01
Why would the price go down if more people would use it ?
@_date: 2017-12-23 16:03:23
The value is that you can do a non censorable transaction. I can do one because I own Bitcoin. Can you do one ?
And since I own more Bitcoin than you, my transaction is more worth than your (possible) transaction, so I can get more out of it.
@_date: 2017-12-02 16:36:33
Quite the opposite I would say. When everyone switches fees will be very small
@_date: 2017-12-21 13:24:37
Because Bitcoin is not able to scale while Altcoins can.
The pool of unconfirmed transactions it growing at a rate of 100.000 per day. Bitcoin is dying from a technical standpoint. Maybe it will be something like Gold, but for doing transaction there are better systems.
@_date: 2017-12-02 20:16:23
Why ? Because the blockchains gets too big ?
@_date: 2017-12-21 14:50:15
You are misinformed
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:50:55
Ethereum will probably overtake it so yes
@_date: 2017-12-02 20:16:01
@_date: 2017-12-21 14:32:03
I‘m in this space because of technology not because I believe in the name of „Bitcoin“ to be hyped to moon. 
Bitcoin is broken, Altcoins work, so I switch to Altcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-21 14:55:17
Look at the technology and try to understand it.
There is a source of truth and it‘s called open source code. You can take a look at how everything works to the smallest detail. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:02:38
I am using the latest Bitcoin Core Client and generated a new Waller a couple of days ago, should use Segwit right ?
@_date: 2017-12-19 09:24:48
You pretty much don‘t have transaction fees and transaction are way quicker
@_date: 2017-12-25 11:15:48
Dodgecoim really ? How about you send them Ethereum instead
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:02:03
You are one single person, you may like the world how you would like but the people don‘t need to agree with you, so you don‘t know what will happen.
And I don‘t invest in Shitcoins, I‘m talking about Ethereum + IOTA (I hope you don‘t consider them Shitcoins or you are a moron)
@_date: 2017-12-21 14:19:41
Send and store value on a dezentralized system.
@_date: 2017-12-23 13:08:30
Yes it‘s quite popular. Backup the wallet.
@_date: 2017-12-16 17:29:33
I wish I would be wrong, but it‘s the truth, you can‘t deny it.
@_date: 2017-12-19 09:51:24
No bigger blocksize = more transactions can fit in each block
@_date: 2017-08-13 06:54:06
You should delete that post, we can see your name + transactions
@_date: 2017-11-17 19:44:53
It will work the same as before, just the ability to track transactions is gone, is this a important feature for you ?
I am pro anonymous Transactions anyway so I didn´t see a problem in this
@_date: 2017-11-17 19:56:12
Why shouldn´t my idea work ?
Or do you mean because Bitcoin should have a history ?
@_date: 2017-11-17 20:20:33
Sign a transaction Using a private key. The transaction contains an Amount + receiver. No transaction to the same receiver could have the same amount.
How should you replay that ?
@_date: 2017-11-28 07:19:54
Search for a .dat file, if you find none you can delete it
@_date: 2017-11-17 19:41:44
I mean keep the algorithm that confirms the transaction but why not reduce the data stored afterwards ?
Shouldn´t be a problem
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:44:10
You don‘t get it.
It‘s like taking a Dollar bill and cutting it into 2 pieces. You don’t necessarily make them worth 2 dollars 
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:50:04
I didn´t thought people would buy Bitcoin bc of the free segwit2x Coin...
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:50:55
But it is great News

I would actually consider an iOS Wallet to be more safe.
iOS hacks are very rare due to the way Apple designed it. 
A hardware Wallet (if Stolen) is lost money (if not backed up) or is it secured using a key ?
@_date: 2017-11-19 10:54:35
You mean like 1234 ? That would not ne very secure.
Think you should be easily able to reverse engineer it or take it apart. Doing that on an iPhone is impossible. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:26:35
You don‘t open it.
You use it in combination with a Programm. Don‘t share it. Try Bitcoin Core Wallet.
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:46:55
On the other side: sell your Bitcoin guys I´ll buy them all HAHAHA
@_date: 2017-11-17 19:57:27
Why is this so important for you ?
It is still dezentralized, that´s the important part IMO
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:03:27
Well why not fork Bitcoin over an over and become rich then. Glad I‘m a programmer and know how to do that.
@_date: 2017-11-22 11:43:44
Wow that‘s sick !

same for me
@_date: 2017-09-02 11:47:20
Stock Market is doing quite bad atm
@_date: 2017-09-03 16:32:48
Bitcoin transactions are too expensive
@_date: 2017-09-03 12:58:00
Do you even mine bro
@_date: 2017-09-03 16:36:24
It´s also $0.37 for a 1 dollar transaction that´s the problem
@_date: 2017-09-02 11:47:49
Same with Ethereum and the IT-industry
@_date: 2017-09-02 11:42:08
Is there an App using Coinmarketcap ?
@_date: 2017-09-03 16:30:20
First you need to fix the technology, then you can think about making it user friendly imo
@_date: 2017-09-02 11:49:05
Hope we´ll get this soon
@_date: 2017-09-10 17:50:45
@_date: 2017-09-03 15:24:39
Hope we´ll get them soon in germany. Seems like they are not allowed so far
@_date: 2017-09-03 15:55:44
First we need the fee situation resolved then we can talk about mainstream adoption
@_date: 2017-09-13 22:08:30
They probably don't care about 5$, 50$ or 500$ ��
@_date: 2017-09-03 13:04:21
You seem to forget that every transaction has the same fee meaning every transaction would cost .37$ which is quite much when bitcoin should become digital cash
@_date: 2017-10-02 11:32:01
Is it already active ?
@_date: 2017-09-03 15:39:59
share the meme pls
@_date: 2017-09-02 11:48:39
Of course we are early adopters. Especially when not only talking about Bitcoin but Ethereum, Steemit,...
@_date: 2017-09-02 11:46:12
It dipped a bit 
@_date: 2017-09-03 15:29:22
@_date: 2017-09-03 17:08:04
Transactions fees don´t depend on how much you send that´s what I wanted to tell you
@_date: 2017-10-15 17:47:51
wtf Ethereum will also succeed imo
@_date: 2017-10-15 18:21:43
You get that Bitcoin is a Cryptocurrency while Ethereum is a Plattform for Smart Contracts ?
