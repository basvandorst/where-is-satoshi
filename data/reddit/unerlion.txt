Or else you'll spam him with various amounts of bitcoins with the text "jerk" attached to it? Or maybe meet him in a dark Walmart parking lot for a fist fight?

Read their Bitcoin help page. They use Bitpay to get USD. They don't care about BTC, just about the USD they can get for it.

Oh you should have been watching during the shutdown. There were hours, **HOURS** where people were just going up and and saying "I would like to bring house resolution blah blah to a vote" and being answered "Pursuant to rule blah blah only the current majority leader can bring a resolution to vote. Next!" 
 
Just that and nothing else. It was actually hilarious since the speaker would get visibly angry towards the end.

Considering that the rules committee, who can add new rules and suspend others at almost any time, was the one who created the situation (at Cantor's request) and they're probably going to keep their seats, and it's a 9-3 majority in the GOP's favor...Yes it can and probably will happen again.

This happens from time to time on Cspan. Try clicking on the closed captioning button. Sometimes that makes it work.

With things like that both sides are playing rules lawyers. In the real world if a million people were in line and they were all asking you the exact same thing you'd humor them maybe a few time then just announce to everyone to fuck off if they're asking that question. 
  
But the rules in the senate/house say that they are allowed to make that proposition and the speaker has to let them. Problems would come in when the speaker would start just calling contempt as soon as they said "HR: or "call for vote". Which he can do, but tradition was that you let people finish before cutting them off. Then the speaker would do things like waiting for congressmen/senators to pause for even a second and then move on "since they were done". Which again was a letter of the law vs spirit. 
  
Both sides were just getting so mad at each other. Everyone was just bringing out so much rule minutia to argue with since the GOP locked up the house and made it so no one could call bills to vote but the House Majority leader. Not even GOP members could call a vote to keep business going. It's was such bullshit.

There was a full on government shut down barely a whole month ago. I doubt this will out pace that viewship.
