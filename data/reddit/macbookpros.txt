Well yea, but central banks loan the money to normal banks, then normal banks loan the money to people

Can someone edit this gif to show different crypto logos on the shields are they rotate in the air, then as the final guy bounces forward put a bitcoin symbol on his chest

Does anyone know how I can purchase from the US using a VPN and maybe a prepaid European debit card?
@_date: 2015-12-24 17:57:20
So that's only if you withdraw the Bitcoin for USD right. What if you sold your Bitcoin for cash on localbitcoin. Or spent your Bitcoin on gift cards and sold the gift cards for cash/ something related to that nature

I agree, but I make small btc transaction, 2 btc was probably my max. But I keep hearing on this subreddit of coinbase doing shady stuff for people making transactions of $10,000+. So for that reason I will not be using coinbase anymore, I refuse to support them for that reason. Nor do I feel safe if I ever ever wanted to make a big btc purchase

Man fuck financial times, because of them I had a completely unnecessary large financial loss. I was short the eur/usd and they tweeted totally incorrect information regarding interest rates and I got stopped out of my position because the markets reacted to the false info. They will forever be on my shit list.

Nothing to worry about, the other 57 percent bought their coins for the low low and never need to work a day in their lives again.

I always thought that way too, I don't think any human really has the balls to hold their position for when btc was worth tens of dollars until btc was worth thousands. It's human instinct to protect profits and start selling once you see your position begin to double, triple, quadruple.... the only people who caught the entire wave up are those that totally forgot about their coins stored in old hard drives, or a very select few people that had so many coins they were able to gradually sell off and take some profits while still holding on to some coins.

Why are you guys arguing? The issue is not Bernie, Hilary , Chavez, trump... None of them. The issue is the ENTIRE GOVERNMENT SYSYEM. Doesn't fucking matter who becomes president, still the same fucked up corrupt system. So whoever you are voting for president, if you think they are going to solve this countries problems, your a joke. In fact your part of the problem. Supporting any of these fools.

You know, everyone complains about Coinbase and sometimes I really wonder what is so bad about them. I have been using them for like a year now and have never had a bad experience. My btc purchases have always been instantly deposited into my wallet (as long as I stay within my $200 instant limit) and have never had an issue converting btc into usd. But I recently have been thinking of using circle because of the awesome looking iMessage app they have. You can instantly send bitcoin through text messages with the new ios10 on iPhone!

I'm just curious why people want to use paypal and not their debt card / bank account? There is literally nothing illegal or wrong about buying bitcoin... 
@_date: 2017-09-01 17:31:43
A lot of us were hoping for a drop either to buy more or to buy in for the first time, but bitcoin just keeps climbing! :p
@_date: 2017-09-01 13:09:46
I was having problems too, I ended up buying my bitcoin at a nearby bitcoin ATM and sending my coins to my hard drive wallet. The Buying from an ATM was a pretty neat experience too! And super simple, didn't need to give all my personal info either.

Cause I missed out on buying at $100 a coin :(

Think I can put this post on my resume?  ��
@_date: 2017-09-01 12:59:13
�� luckily I bought 2 coins at $1,900 was looking to buy another 0.5 btc at around $3,700 but looks like I'm not getting that chance ever again :( 
@_date: 2017-09-01 14:01:24
@_date: 2017-09-01 19:28:44
Yes it really is. When I bought in at $1,900 I was nervous because I thought $1,900 was high.... but I'm so glad I did. 
@_date: 2017-09-01 13:06:18
That's when I bought my only 2 coins! I'm glad I caught that one
@_date: 2017-09-01 17:30:33
Don't hate yourself bro. Chances are if you would have bought $500 worth of bitcoin at $2 each there's no way you would of held that purchase until it reached 1 million. Chances are you would of took profit when your $500 turned into $1,000 or $5,000, or definitely at $10,000. It's just human instinct that forces you to take profit at some point. Also there's always opportunities on the market, right now there companies trading on the exchange for $1-$2 a share that could possibly be worth $1,000 a share in 2035! Gotta just keep hunting down opportunities and go with your gut when you feel something has tremendous potential. Also never invest what you can't afford to lose!

People should realize just because they saw it doesn't mean the rest of the world did too.

I was hoping for a sub 4K pullback in hopes of buying some more and then breaking 5K+ but looks like I've missed out on the re entry so I'm just going to hold what I've got until my gut tells me the right time to buy more!

Word of advice, if you value a friendship don't ever recommend anyone to invest in anything. 
@_date: 2016-10-18 16:36:15
I agree. I love bitcoin, I support it wholeheartedly. But with our crooked government and banks you never know what type of major regulations could be put into effect knocking down or making acquiring btc very difficult. If you want to push people into using it and get into the habit of making transactions with bitcoin to get the feel for it, that is great! But the fact that you have already gotten people to invest in something because of your "enthusiasm" puts you in a really bad position as a friend.

I don't need anything, I just need the cash! Actually looking to use it to pay off my paypal credit statement :p
@_date: 2016-05-02 02:00:47
Consider this: That's a terrible example
@_date: 2017-05-18 19:54:08
I live in NYC, supposedly its regulated here or something. I had my coinbase account closed because of this, so now im stuck with this btc and no way to cash out. Everything used to be perfect with coinbase, but now I am in a bit of a pickle :(
