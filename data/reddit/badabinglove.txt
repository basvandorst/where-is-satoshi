I don't know....I don't think the dollar is going anywhere and bitcoin can always be priced against the dollar. If its going to be used that way then people can just think of it as spending dollars. I think Bitcoin will be used as more of a savings account. somewhere to put money so that it won't inflate or deflate. its a neutral account since there is a finite amount.

It's a feeling of superiority. It's subtle . They've done what others want. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:42:27
in my estimation either two things are happening. Either a) the world is catching on and the demand for bitcoin is becoming insane. b) we are in a serious bubble that might burst......I think A is more of what is going on than B but its a little of both.

What makes you think it doesn't have utility. In my opinion Bitcoin is a response to the central banking system which seems to believe in Keynesian economics. People who save money must constantly invest it or they will loose the value. This means that the dollar is a terrible store of value. Bitcoin in theory is a much greater store of value because it cannot be printed out of thin air. It must be mined and its programmed to have a finite amount. This means it's price should stabilize once it is adopted. All of this is speculative but from I can tell I don't really see too many holes in the theory for why it could work as a store of value. I see crypto currency as the only legitimate response to central banking in the last century. Or I could be wrong and it's beanie babies....But I like to hope that others see its potential the way I do.

True

thats not how rich people work. they actually don't care about money the way poor people do. its the power, the game, like real life sims with a twist...

But that's exactly what they've done with QE in theory. They dish out free money(or money with insanely low interest rates) to financial institutions and the financial institutions in turn give money to public for extremely cheap rates(credit card terms are insane, stated income loans, etc) and this essentially acts as a sort of welfare where cheap money is available.

I don't think bitcoins role will be for everyday transaction. Other coins are better for that but I do think it's a potential good store of value. If you put 100k in the bank you will reliably lose + 3% every year. Bitcoin can theoretically avoid his once it is fully integrated in society and the price has settled.

I'm basically a sales rep for Bitcoin.... And I agree with you

Youve never noticed that wealthy people have common characteristics? I'm not I am any better or that I wouldnt be the same way with some of the privileges you gain when you are wealthy. Money affects our behavior and perspective.

100% agree with you. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:13:53
@_date: 2017-12-10 11:22:09
Me too. I guess my point is, Bitcoin serves a purpose that is not merely the fate of beanie babies. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:27:52
The technology is fine. It's a completely inelastic store of value. It's a place that is truly independent of inflation manipulation. If we all agree it is a store of value and it is independent of The QE the fed has been pumping for a decade then it does have real value. I don't lose money while saving. Bitcoin has a finite amount. That to me is value enough. Not having someone use policies to rob my value through inflation is a very encouraging concept. Bitcoin embodies that I believe. Sure small transactions might come from a different coin but Bitcoin seems to have a very solid idea driving it even if other coins have worked out some kinks. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 10:57:52
I'm not sure why it's so difficult to understand. It's going to take time for Bitcoin to be accepted and fully integrated into society. It's happening. But it takes time. In that time the value will for sure go up due to how many more people will be using it. Therefore we can make the connection that time is a variable of the value function. The more time that passes(at least right now) the higher the value should be. This is only true on a trend line since the ups and downs are inevitable but it should trend upwards significantly as it becomes adopted and demanded.

Gold is rare and difficult to mine but Bitcoin is literally finite. there is a literally cutoff on how much bitcoin is in circulation. this fixes it. Also bitcoin is easier to maneuver than gold. I can pay someone a million dollars worth of bitcoin much easier than I can with gold.(thats a serious statement, I might buy a house with bitcoin one day). overall it is very similar to gold. Bitcoin has been described as gold 2.0 by some people. I tend to agree with this analogy. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:52:09
I understand what you are saying but let me play devils advocate(you know more than me I just want to basically ask a question) What if this recent rise is the world catching on. Bitcoin has been in the shadows for awhile and just recently has hit more of a mainstream. what if this sharp rise is just a giant increase in demand. Would that not change the analysis? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:25:39
its such horseshit. our government is like a drunk special needs child that is just functional enough to feed itself yet some people have the idea that giving it more money and power is a good idea....I just can't wrap my head around how grown adults don't see that is a bad idea....

Thank you kind sir

wait really? even if I'm self employed? I make like 15k a year self employed(I'm a full time student) and they rape me on taxes.

Honestly can someone make it ELI5. Hardware wallets are scary. I understand the concept but I don't really understand how this little USB stick is holding a bunch of Bitcoin. What if I lose the USB or there is a house fire or I get burglarized. I completely agree with your comment but it'd be nice if someone did a step by step for people that are not tech savvy at all. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:15:58
Bitcoin is starting to be accepted around the world. It's becoming established. At this point it would take a very serious turn of events to reverse this momentum. I think we will at the very very least see 25k Bitcoin in 2018.

is anything really regulated? isn't the sec basically a post office with a fancy title and some people that are supposed to be doing something but have no power? I'm partly joking and partly not....

100% agree with that. I didnt get in until it was at 2k. Im still stoked but Im not in the position other are where they literally turned pennies into retirement. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:00:01
that would be great. that means I can retire in a year. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:05:00
its not backed by nothing. Its backed by the  consistency of the relationship between the company and the public. Bitcoin has been a consistent concept that has not done any wrong to anyone and has consistently given what it has promised. It may not be backed by a tangible but it is backed.

Is it common knowledge among people in the know that "got hacked" means the owner of the exchange stole everyone's coins?

I can duplicate everything microsoft and apple does but I won't replace them or even register in the market place.

less people mining but more people using. if 500 million people use bitcoin then transaction fees could be reduced significantly since more transactions would be happening. if it costs a 200k a month to support quick transaction and there are a million transactions a month then fees could be low. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:33:06
why wouldnt the new volume of transactions be supported? wouldnt the platform just grow to account for increased use.
@_date: 2017-12-10 11:02:06
The mere fact that it is a decentralized network is value enough(people can't track what you do with your money) Also there's the fact that there is a finite amount of Bitcoin and there is not a central bank to print more of it with no oversight. Bitcoin might be one of the greatest inventions of our time. It saddens me when people see it as a valueless get rich quick scheme, I feel like you've missed the point of the technology and what it is responding too. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:44:34
there are people that have 7 figures in their wallet. they probably got there with only a few grand. Think about investing a few grand, seeing it rise to over a million, and then watching it go to essentially zero......the gun doesnt seem so far away when you think about it. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:23:04
why would it take months to transfer bitcoin.

No but I know very wealthy people.

Dang. Sounds like a business opportunity. Why wouldn't another bank come along and offer better rates and take all the customers?

Do you have any predictions on the bubble pop? The world seems to still be in the beginning phase of all these. New countries adding hype. News outlets reporting on it.....what is your prediction, I'm interested in opinions outside the HODL thought process.

Im thinking we may hit 10k in the next couple of weeks due to the recent publicity and people talking about it at thanksgiving. I just want to time the correction and buy back in after it drops.

They are speculative but I personally think it's much more likely that the base of Bitcoin holders will grow. I truly believe most millennials will own some Bitcoin before the price settles down and I don't think we are anywhere near that.

I don't think 4000 is anywhere near its ceiling.

 I think bitcoin is finding a new level of support before it rockets. The general public is becoming well aware of what bitcoin is and major companies and even countries are starting to really buy in. I think we have only experienced a small part of the bull. I remember stocks in 2012 and thinking no way it was going to continue to go up and here I am sitting out while its at 21k.....I have no idea how high bitcoin will get but I don't think we are anywhere near its ceiling until I hear about either a major scandal or my grandma owning it. I really think almost all millennials will own some bitcoin before this bull is over and WE ARENT ANYWHERE NEAR THAT!
