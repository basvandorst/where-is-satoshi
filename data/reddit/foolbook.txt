This is not about lambos, it's about fighting the governments with intelligence and strategy.
I don't even know why you brought up the lambo talk since it's obvious that those taking advantage of the lack of regulation to create pump and dump ICO scams are the ones worried about lambos.
There will be no use for Bitcoin if governments ban it and you are really naive if you think otherwise. And if crypto is being used to pump and dump scams, that's exactly what the governments will do, they will not waste time differentiating one from the other, they will ban the whole thing. This is not Mr. Robot, it's real life.

I don't think fighting censorship should be a priority. We need to work on preventing governments from banning Bitcoin in the first place. This includes some self-regulation but what is happening is that, given freedom, people are using it to scam others.

I dont see how those companies you mention can be better than banks. They will probably be the same or worse. They are not the good guys, they are actually willing to destroy and monopolize the market if they have a chance. They are the opposite of bitcoin, their goal is centralization to the fullest.

I find this "us against them" rhetoric so beat up and inaccurate. I also find blockchain overhyped. It's very good for payments but nothing much else.

lol, the thing is no one will use crypto if the governments all start banning bitcoin now. Not at this stage. We first need to keep following the rules, then when bitcoin becomes too big to ban, that's the end game and that's how you fight censorship, by becoming too big to ban.

I'm surprised so many people are butthurt just because some dude exposed his opinions.

Hey OP, do you get your water and electricity from the government?

Stop calling it "bitcoin cash" it's not bitcoin.

Everytime there is a fork, there is a new coin created. So this completely destroys the argument that bitcoin is against money printing.

Bitcoin is about disintermediation so obviously we don't need companies as intermediaries.
