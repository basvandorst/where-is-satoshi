Interesting. What's the difference between the coinbase platform and GDAX? Just wondering why anyone would pay coinbase fees if they have another platform that does the same thing but low/no fees.

Would it go to two separate accounts or would it all still go into my coinbase wallet?

Definitely not as straightforward but I'm trying to understand what I'm doing before I use GDAX To make a purchase. I read that to have 0% fees while buying bitcoin I just have to go under the limit tab and make sure post only is check marked, then put in the amount I wanna buy. Then I will have the amount after a few days. Which is essentially what coinbase does but without the fees. Is this true?

That's awesome! I'm kicking myself so hard because I knew about it maybe 2 years ago but didn't fully understand it/was paying off loans at the time and didn't have much cash. Ah well. Fast forward I bough about 7k worth a few days ago through coinbase. Anyone making purchases using another website? Their fees are ridiculous. Wanted to buy more but also had a 7k weekly limit. Also ridiculous. Is it still worth it to buy these days? Or did I miss the curve? Just wondering what y'all think bitcoin could jump to value wise in the next few months/years

Ah ok. So I have to put usd first? Coinbase allows you to pull from your bank directly so thought i could do that if I wanted to lock in the price. Let's say instead of asking for 1 btc I ask for a dollar amount. Let's say right market price is 6500. I put $6500, would I get 1 btc?
