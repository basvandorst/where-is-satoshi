Finally, this is a really good write-up and I'm glad you referenced Hull. I fully agree with your final statement.

Changing the coinbase schedule + reducing the difficulty adjustment target (currently 10min over 2016 blocks) would require a hardfork. 
But even you did that, halving the reward now would not be enough to maintain the original schedule.

Wasn't it crucified by the authority in control? Aren't thread like that just the mob lynching him during his walk through Jerusalem? This is pretty ironic.
