Article says no. They say bet on gold and silver instead if you want to diversify. 
Bitcoin is like gambling on ponies.
Saved y’all a click.  Now we can go mark that article as fake news

So SHA256 is not an optimal algorithm? Could you maybe clarify why it is a thread that miners are incentivized to keep this algorithm and why it will get “messy”?
And it is a good point on the 51% attack. I guess you are right that going down that route would immensely damage the confidence in the network and would ultimately make prices tumble.

How do you report if you bought BTC but haven’t sold any?
@_date: 2019-08-28 22:08:21
Yeah, I use that which is awesome, but I do most everyday purchases with CC still.

What is the biggest thread to Bitcoins security? And how likely is a 51% attack (hearing a lot of the hashing power is originated out of China for example).
Thanks for your time!

Sounds exciting!  
I recently set up a wallet and trying out lightning as well. Still really new to this, but have tried to hand out some tips on [tippin.me]( etc.  
Never received Sats though, would be happy if you could try my address as test!

Just did!  
Did you get it?
@_date: 2019-04-24 16:25:19
Haha, awesome!  
It deducted -3 sats, so guess im paying 2 sats in fee (USD 0.00018)?  
Tech is amazing, man.
@_date: 2019-04-24 16:12:56
I did!!! Haha, guess that was my aha-moment. Fast and smooth!
Cool, thanks man!
@_date: 2019-01-25 20:00:35
Amazing!  
Was it via LN or on-chain?  
Any fees/discount to pay via crypto?

I am so freaking bullish on BTC, it is actually insane.  
Later in life, we are all going to look back at this time with "Central Banks" printing money under fancy names like "financial stimulus" and "quantitative easing" and realize that they tricked everyone and that the magic trick of creating money out of thin air is no different than the Romans de-basing their gold coins with cheaper metals back in the day. You cannot create fake money.  If that was the case, Venezuela would be the richest country on Earth. Soon, we will all realize what a global Currency Circus is going on here.

Think a collapse of the dollar due to hyperinflation would be extremely bullish to Bitcoin.People want to find secure and sound assets in times of uncertainties.Gold will soar and even though we havent had a recession during  "Bitcoin times" I believe this asset class will work similair to gold - maybe not as powerful as precious metals, but still bullish.

Sorry for the loss there, OP.

I was looking to find answers to this exact question..HOW is deflation not a problem for BTC? Do you have more info from Andreas where he talks about this?Will it not slow down economic growth and cease spending if people's BTC holding gets more valuable and you "earn" better value to hold than invest in business/companies/start ups/tech/real estate etc etc?
There is a reason why 2% inflation is the goal as it "motivates" investments as otherwise your holding will decrease in value.

Same, unfortunately was away and only back now, so didn’t get the exact fire sale...
