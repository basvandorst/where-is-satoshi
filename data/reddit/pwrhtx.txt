Just go listen to the WCN on YouTube or on iTunes, Thomas hunt, tone vays , jimmy song and Chris derose are my go to for crypto and bitcoin information, I used to believe people that were into bitcoin were just biased but as I found out more on bitcoin I too now believe it to be the second coming of Christ in the form of 1s and 0s

Dude does coin base or any vendor even allow you to do that this time around? I bet it cost like half ur bitcoin to move them ugh

Ignore bitcoin altogether bc bitcoin is real and too primitive which means too complicated for the normal folk which means loosing your money quick and easy if you don’t store that shit the right way, so ignore bitcoin altogether or study it and take advantage of it

Got it, I took a screenshot of your comment need all the info I can find from experienced bitcoineers, so since we’re schooling a newbie what can you or anyone tell me about litecoin and ethereum? Are those going to take off at some point as well?
@_date: 2018-02-07 23:09:29
This was beautiful thanks
@_date: 2017-10-15 02:45:54
It’s surreal to me when I see bitcoin pop up randomly on some stores, still got none :/
@_date: 2017-10-15 02:40:39
Ah like sell it to another human for the amount the bitcoin is worth in USD and have them deposit the money to my bank account
