You gotta send that in a message to the bot

Hope you've got enough proof now ;)

If you want friendliness, you know where to go. +100 doge 
@_date: 2014-01-11 00:10:03
Look up that definition, it doesn't mean what you think it means.

+5 doge
Joke's on you

I like the way you think, it's clear and lacking distraction. 
I think, however, that you are ignoring the context Satoshi set with his actions. I also think you're thinking too far into the word "libertarianism."
What is fact is that both Satoshi and Lib'ns value decentralization. A tool is whatever you make it to be. Hence the Silk Road, et al.

Again, how is that relevant? You're comparing doge to bitcoin. There's a trillion trillion cells in your body, they're so useless.

Everyone has a hard time wrapping their head around it, those people that are giving you definitive answers are stubborn thinkers that have it "figured out." Anything can happen to the dogecoin, it's just that the odds are against it. 
I'll be on my way to the moon, however.

It's probably a matter of principle, but a trillionth of a doge (or whatever that is, I'm not gonna count) is insignificant. The doge deposit problem is more significant, however. What's the problem with the former? And have they games you with BTC trades?
@_date: 2013-12-31 15:18:35
Yes. It may be worthless, but there are people out there with tens of millions of dogecoins. That's already $5,000, if you can get those orders through.

One altcoin will exit the fray as the "one altcoin." While not being a great comparison, we do know that multiple currencies can coexist.
