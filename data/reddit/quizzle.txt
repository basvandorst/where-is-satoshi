No, I confirmed what I said before about network effect. Similar but not identical.

BCH has just as much first mover advantage as BTC

Why are we even still using this analogy? 
Anyways, my argument is that no that’s not how it is. Both facebooks exist in parallel exactly how they were at the split, although most users continue to just use fork A instead of B.

That’s a nonsense analogy. It’s more like if different contingents within Facebook split it up into two different nearly identical facebooks with slightly different philosophies.

They’re branches of the same fork. One branch isn’t older than the other.
BTC has a bigger and more popular network, sure, but proponents of BCH will (correctly) argue that it’s just as much of a first mover as BTC.

Don't forget fees hidden in their exchange rate.

Treat it like opening a tab and paying at the end (holding a license as surety), only your check has a QR code on it.

If bitgo is compromised, a hacker has access to your password whenever you type it in and send it to bitgo.

It's not a conflict of interest, because their financial interests align with their professional ones.
It is a strong and obvious bias though.

I wonder how many people (like myself) are subscribed to both

I forget which graffiti artist this is, but IIRC he doesn't have anything to do with cryptos

How the heck does segwit enable that?
@_date: 2017-10-26 14:48:08
That’s the lightning network, not segwit.

Actually the vast vast majority of addresses have nothing. Hitting "create wallet" and immediately losing the address doesn't actually do anything.

All investments carry risk, bitcoin included. Research the risk/reward curve. If you look at it simply as an investment vehicle, it's simply an investment with (very) high-risk and very high potential reward.

You can generate the private key from scratch using this method.

Agreed. Dollars are also technically digital, in that they can't be denominated to arbitrary precision.

Apparently not even:

Haha they quoted the wrong Tim B. Lee.

Will be?
Over three years it has already gone from a penny stock to Google.
