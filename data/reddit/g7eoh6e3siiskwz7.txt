Self fulfilling prophesy argument sounds sensible for those living in a TA bubble, but truth is nobody cares about some lines aligning with a zodiac. There is no real money behind this bs. Just a bunch of people on YouTube convincing their 14yo audience that the drawing they've made on a historical data somehow predicts the future. If it doesn't there's always a caveat - cuz it's a decisive moment-according to the chart - and price will definitely move one way or another.

Do you have to ask them before you can buy? If not, go ahead and buy. The sooner you invest, the sooner you lose money trying to outsmart the market, the sooner you become a successful HODLer. 
It's good to start investing in your early 20s, before that even better. As you are closing on your 30s you become more anxious and more conservative with your risk taking (as you should be). Your twenties is the best time in your life to take huge financial risks, because you can still afford going broke.

BUSINESS IDEA: you are sending nlocktime transaction to a third party business that, for a fee, will turn it into cash and send it to your family member. The nature of nlocktime transaction is that it will only be executed if (1) Blockchain reaches block number "n", which can be easily translated into e.g. 3 years in the future; (2) if, say in a year, you're still alive, you just remove coins from that address with a normal transaction, which means the n-delayed transaction will be invalid (no funds). Then you setup a new 3 year nlocktime from the new address. Repeat every year until you inevitably die.
No doubt there will be a way to do this smoothly in the future. Today I would just leave a letter with instructions for my family or a tech-savvy friend.

+Fiat that was earned from selling some of the bitcoins by the trustee.
Now what's unclear to me is what would be the distribution ratio in terms of % of the remaining assets. Clearly the share in total bankruptcy mass of former bitcoin creditors has increased and for fiat creditors decreased. Is bitcoin going to be re-valued again at 6k? Or are they paying fiat creditors in full (they can do this from the fiat they  already own from the sell off) and distributing whatever is left, in bitcoin and fiat, to bitcoin creditors?

Duh, obviously no serious company would take the volatility risk on itself. And it's 100% true adoption - it allows people to buy goods and services using bitcoin that they hold, without exchanging  their holdings to fiat first which means increased utility and therefore increased value.

It's inelegant because it's unsustainable in the long term and promotes ad-hoc solutions for a system that should be a gold standard in the industry. Double-layer system is one solution to resolve the limitations of block size. You get a slow layer that allows secure settlement of your transactions, and a fast layer which can support a million transactions per second in your day-to-day dealing. It means your second layer transactions cost you close to nothing, and your second layer settlement transactions cost you less thanks to the lower volume on the main chain. Your transactions are instantaneous since you don't have to wait for the next block to be mined, and you also benefit from increased anonymity thanks to the second layer transaction routing. This solution is much better suited for everyday commerce. 
@_date: 2018-07-24 06:20:50
Then you can pay me in lambos and hookers.
But for real, transparency is the key to the cryptocurrency lending process. You'll have to prove that you can accumulate more bitcoins that you borrowed. A company would create a current account address, so that everybody sees its earnings are on point and that bitcoins will be moved from people who spend it, to the business.
I think it is much more risky business to borrow bitcoin, as it is hard for any business to outperform bitcoin gains. Maybe borrowing wouldn't be necessary and we'll just accumulate value by holding.
@_date: 2018-07-25 14:14:48
LN is still in development, which I'm sure you know, and it's not ready for mass adoption at this point. Although current progress is very promising. Transaction fees are certainly not the most pressing issue for the community right now, otherwise people would use any other altcoin which has plenty of room in their blocks. What people value in bitcoin is its ability to find innovative solutions to complex problems, which can be achieved with best devs in the industry working on the problem, who prove their expertise by coming up with LN for example. A block size increase doesn't require a lot of sophistication and always remains a low effort solution. Does this second layer make BTC more robust? Yes, in terms of anonymity and everyday utility. No, because transactions are taken off chain, which is a risk every user will have to bear. Less centralised? Yes, although indirectly -more utility means more users and potentially more people to run full nodes (contrary to big block chains, which increase hardware requirements promoting centralisation).

It's not big in terms of adoption mainly due to lack of clear regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies in Poland - both in terms of trading and commerce. This, however, should improve within a year, with government planning to put in place clear tax regulation by July 2019.
