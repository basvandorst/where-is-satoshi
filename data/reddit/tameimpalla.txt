I think this speculation is a good thing. I don't feel that Bitcoin is all that useful as a currency. It has some interesting applications:
The international transfer of wealth.
Illegal trading
And a few places allow trade with it
As a normal law abiding person, I have little real use for it as it stands now. Im intrigued by it's economic possibilities. And its nice too see some economic theories being tested, but for me it's pretty worthless except for an investment right now. I'm hoping all the attention well help make it more common place so it might function like a normal, but decentralized currency. With more places that accept it and trade it easily, securely and fairly. To be more useful it need more exposure and more people to figure out how to make it more useful.

If you own stock in the united states (most) it can only be traded when the market is open. 9AM to 4PM closed on weekends and holidays.  Not sure about currency exchanges.

Was it a bank transfer? Is this what you are referring to? 
They make it seem like it's the price you committed to when you clicked buy. But it seems like this would put them at considerable risk when the price fluctuates. If a bank transfer didn't go through.

Same shit with me. It says today at 4:48 for me. Im not really expecting to see it there. The whole thing is so f'ed up. Im just glad I didn't put much in it. The process to get $ to bitcoin is just so slow and cumbersome. I'm expecting I'll get it at some point, but I'm not holding my breath.

Depends on how much you are putting in. I wouldn't put a lot in right now. Its way too risky. If you are just wanting to play around a bit, go ahead now, if not...let the dust settle. Don't speculate for investment purposes unless you are willing to loose it.
