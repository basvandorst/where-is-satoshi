I don't know any of these terms lmao I wasn't serious. I like the term "snake in the tunnel" without knowing it's meaning :)

So will we say "you had to have a credit card and wait for 2 minutes to pay your pizza" in the near future then?

I don't think any bank or company tried to crash bitcoin yet but they will for sure. This cryptocurrency thing is big. Oil companies started war for oil. I can't imagine what companies and governments do if cryptocurrency takes their money from their hands.

Yes It is a bubble, can confirm.

Bitcoin would crash so rapidly. It's effect would be so huge in my opinion. It recovers in a long term because I don't think cryptocurrency is stoppable but it definitely would crash bitcoin for a week or for a month or even for a year.

I am not expert or some sh*t but it has to be something minor like Christmas or manipulation from market itself. I just don't think any banks or companies involved in this massive "correction" or whatever. This market is still not stable. People can panic and sell their coins just because of a tweet for example. Wait for the big crashes as the money starts to be used more in real life. "The war" hasn't started yet.
