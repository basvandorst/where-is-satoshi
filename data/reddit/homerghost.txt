I can't agree with this advice. They're only following similar trends because nobody knows what has real world value and what doesn't.
The idea is that blockchain technology will graduate from speculation to useful and people look back in 20 years time saying "Jeez, I wish I'd bought shares in Altcoin X" in the same way they say "Jeez, I wish I'd bought shares in Apple" now.

People don't buy and sell gold bullion because of its industrial applications. This is actually a great example of a logical fallacy. 
"Bitcoin is worthless as a store of value, unlike gold which has excellent conductive properties" 
The important factor in the relevant use case - and where the Egypt example came in - is scarcity and uptake. Both Gold and Bitcoin are scarce and are being utilised for a passive purpose. Bitcoin has huge advantages as an arbitrary store of value, because of its fungible, easily stored, easily transferred **digital** nature. Comparing apples with oranges (Facebook? Really?) doesn't change or undermine this. 
Good luck solving climate change, anyway.

This shouldn't be getting downvoted. Downvoting isn't "I disagree" or "I don't like this". This is an important question that we shouldn't be hiding from. 
Gold standard doesn't exist anymore. The worth of money is related to multiple things, including supply/demand, how much people are willing to pay in other currencies for it, and various governmental trust factors related to reserves and economy.
Even if money received its value from gold, what makes gold valuable? Its not its industrial applications. Its the fact that it's desirable and scarce.

If you owned 100% of the world's gold reserves, what makes you think that the world would be beating down your door to buy it from you at any price? That's not quite how economics works.
Iron used to be far more valuable than Gold. In Ancient Egypt for example, they attached insane value to meteorite iron especially.
Historically, there has never been any single value relationship that withstood the test of time and circumstance. And we very much now live in a digital age.

Most people don't care about decentralisation. They also don't care about the compression methods on streamed video, what type of disc their media comes on, whether their screen is OLED or LCD, etc.
They will "care" about these things by proxy when big movers make their choices, and then the consumer sees it as smart to buy a Blu Ray player instead of an HD DVD Player (very broad example there) even when it made absolutely zero practical difference to the vast majority of users.
The small percentage of people who are earning, moving and storing vast sums of money on an international basis have a lot to care about when it comes to decentralisation. That's a good reason why decentralisation is important, not because the masses are crying out for it.

I wish people weren't being so rude to you, you're hardly being unreasonable.
But it's wrong to call December a crash. The lowest the price fell was an all-time high less than a month ago. Prices fluctuate. You have to look at 3 or even 6 month periods. 
There will be times when you see your altcoins all crawling down in value and you'll be tempted to sell them all for bitcoin. Sometimes the reverse will be true. That's why the market tends to move the way it does. But a diversified portfolio is never a bad thing.

You're entirely missing the point if you call decentralisation a "weakness", it's not even a caveat. It's part of the design. This comes with pros and cons depending on your requirements. But listing them as flaws is pure editorialism.

It speaks volumes that their goal is not to promote their altcoin on its own merits, it's to push the "we're better than Bitcoin!" agenda, an insecure approach which is clearly an effort to obfuscate their own significant issues.
Also, the fact that this person is privately messaging dissenters of their favourite "brand" says a lot. Quite an inferiority complex, and it's irritating that so much discourse is being wasted on this bickering.

This was a humorous meme, not info.
The point wasn't that Ripple was a bad short term investment (clearly!), it's that it is a centralised corporately owned digital currency that doesn't actually fit the criteria or philosophy of a cryptocurrency. 
Where to look for info? When it comes to finance, there is nothing but speculation. There is no fountain of knowledge, because if there  was some hallowed website that had said "buy ripple, it's about to explode!" that website would be very popular indeed right now.

Bitcoin hasn't yet solidified its place in the world beyond novelty and speculation, which means rumours are the wind beneath its sails. Even news items still just fall under the category of "more substantial rumours" until Bitcoin has tangible, real world, *realised* utility. 
The same wind that blew it up to its ATH can just as easily bring it crashing back down to a fraction of that. Because it's all speculation. 
But it doesn't change the fact that IF Bitcoin has viable real world utility, then none of this will matter, because the price will organically gravitate towards that point in due course and we'll look back on this month as the time when Bitcoin was insanely undervalued.
Note the emphasis on "IF". We need to be realistic, but above all, the community and developers need to be smart and innovative.

The more it grows, the more we will see an influx of people who have no interest in anything other than telling us how wrong we are.
I'm not saying it should be immune from criticism, but I don't feel like I'm seeing people who care about the tech, more so people who don't want to feel stupid for not being invested. So their end goal is the dream of being able to point, laugh and say "I told you so".

Your wallet actually exists on the blockchain, you access your funds (prove ownership) with a complex password key like X2f6MNF&amp;Z&amp;sc$!86...
Your seed word phrase (shark mother house full angle...) is nothing more than a clever way of recreating that garbled private key. This works well for backup purposes.
The ONLY difference between a hardware wallet or paper/app/etc wallet is that a hardware wallet generates a seed/key for you entirely offline, ensuring it is never exposed to the Internet. Even when connected to something and you're authorising a withdrawal, your hardware wallet just provides an authorisation code, with no exposure of your actual key to anything external. 
You can and should write down the backup seed on paper (or punch it into metal, etc) so if your Ledger breaks or you lose it, you can regain access to your wallet. Make your backup as non-digital as possible. Don't take a photo that gets backed up to the cloud etc.

(Jeez. Disclaimer: "It's always a good time to buy" doesn't mean the price is guaranteed to rise, it means that we can't predict the future, so just buy. Or you could hold out for an entry point that is lower than right now, but there's a *chance* this could actually not happen. Ask someone who didn't buy at $2000 because they were waiting for $1800.)
It's always a good time to buy if you're holding for more than a week or two, but that's assuming the price doesn't irreparably plummet, which nobody knows either way.
People buy, and then a week later they see a 20% dip in price, so they feel regret that they should have waited. But then a year later it's up 1000% from the dip price anyway. Above all, nobody can predict when the dips will happen, no matter how confident they sound. 
Unless you're psychic or a master market analyst, always assume it's a good time to buy if you believe in the tech, and only invest what you can afford to lose.

I'm not sure what alternative uses for energy there are, this sounds like wishful thinking. How do you propose that overproduction of electricity could feasibly be harnessed to "improve living conditions"? Can you give an example? 


That's not the argument. It's only cheap because nobody else is currently using it. Supply and demand. So it's being utilised to do something highly profitable.
The point is that critics are trying to portray bitcoin mining as something that destroys rainforests and wastes electricity that people erroneously perceive could somehow be used to end hunger or something. Andreas' point is that this is disingenuous when you look at the reality - it's otherwise wasted.


Of course they will. If they're willing to buy expensive specialised computers for the purpose of maximising mining profits, they'll relocate these computers to further maximise profits.

I have to say, the reasons people give for the Trezor being "better" than the Ledger are pretty tenuous. They're basically the same and I'd be happy with either. I chose the Ledger Nano S for two reasons.

It seems logical to me that a technology that is less established, less congested, and with fewer vested interests is going to have more room to breathe.
Kinda like how kickstarter companies are able to throw out all kinds of interesting bleeding edge progressive tech while the big companies have bigger things to get right first.

Tl;dw: People will always mine where energy is cheapest. Energy is always cheapest where supply most exceeds demand.
This occurs where facilities are built to meet anticipated future growth, rather than current actual demand.

Yes, you can! The seed word system is called BIP39. The system predictably translates word combinations into complex strings of letters, and your unique set of words relates to the string that is your wallet's private and public keys.

Why did VHS win the format war when there was also Betamax? Why wasn't it deemed impossible for any consensus to be reached there? 
Bitcoin is or course not the same as the art trade or format war, but it is a new system and it fills a gap.

Nobody who has invested in Bitcoin is going to be annoyed about the fact that it has consistently appreciated in value, but conversely, it was never supposed to be a "get rich quick" scheme with no limitations or upper limit. Critics are fixating on this narrative for obvious reasons.

When was the last time someone paid for goods/services using gold? Gold is hoarded, but its transfer into something of value requires liquidation. Bitcoin absolutely bridges that gap, but what's so bad about being a commodity? 
I'm playing devil's advocate here, because I agree that spending is a critical part of the "bitcoin manifesto", but I'm not convinced that hodling culture is going to kill bitcoin. If there are buyers and sellers, there is value.

Nobody is telling you that you can't treat Bitcoin as an investment, but it only became an investment thanks to the ideology and the hype train. If it has a future as a currency rather than purely a commodity, people need to trade with it, that's all OP is saying. And I also suspect this is the key to its longevity as an asset. 
Again with the Apple analogy, people happily buy shiny $1,500 Facebook machines because of the accompanying feeling of status and the mythical tales of invulnerability to all malware and nuclear blasts.

Take a look at Jun 24th-July 24th and tell me that your analysis isn't short sighted.

Excellent comment. If you told the guy who spent 10k BTC on pizza that one day a single coin could be worth thousands, he'd probably laugh in your face. 
Bitcoin is and will always be the first of its kind. It's the item of scarcity that has always been missing from the realm of data. It's fair to presume that it won't be worth millions per coin, but only a fool would say it's impossible.  
@_date: 2017-08-07 00:34:05
I think we're getting too fixated on the "money" aspect of bitcoin. Right now, it's just a transferable store of value with a trustless ecosystem. It could be the new dollar, the new gold bullion, or something in between. 
You're making the assumption that nobody ever dips into their savings or cashes out due to necessity or sheer impatience. Some people have the iron will to hodl indefinitely, but many of us won't/can't just let a couple of grand sit in the bank. Everyone wishes they could go back to when a Bitcoin was $10, but many of us probably would have buckled and sold when it got to $100 anyway.
People will always hesitate and let emotion take over, people will always sell, and as long as someone will buy, it has value. 
@_date: 2017-08-03 12:02:35
You're confused. Bitcoin is fundamentally designed to be a trustless currency ecosystem. Sending goods is not a part of Bitcoin's mechanics, that's just trade.

Bitcoin IS an ideology though. It's not just a utilitarian tool - it's a movement, a statement and a revolution. Why not romanticise it? This isn't something banal like contactless card payments, this is a complete paradigm shift, and unless people are passionate and outspoken about Bitcoin, why would anyone care or take interest when we already have a system that works? 
People were probably more fanatical about Apple a few years ago. When Steve Jobs - a cruel businessman - died, his customer base were on suicide watch, and they made about 10 movies about him. He sold overpriced laptops and a walkman that looked like a fridge.

You can set Low/Economic/Normal/High on Mycelium but I don't think you can set custom fees which could be a downside for some!

Yes. The hardware wallet is only as secure as your 12/24 seed words. The seed words ARE your bitcoin. 
Your hardware wallet will generate the words for you on its own secure screen. You can enter these seed words into as many other hardware wallets as you like no problem. Hardware wallet level security.
If you save the seed words onto an Android wallet, or keep them on Evernote, or enter them into wallet software on your PC - the protection of the hardware wallet is gone, because your words have been exposed to a compromisable machine that is connected to the internet.

I agree care should be taken when choosing and safeguarding this word, but generally speaking I think it's wise to keep it a verbal secret.

Hardware Wallets are worth considering if you're dealing with large sums of money. Apps like Mycelium are still infinitely better than an exchange, but your private keys are stored on a USB flash drive like device that never communicates with the internet. You also have to physically press a hardware button to transfer coins out of your account! Ledger Nano S and Trezor are two popular ones.

Actually the devs are in this thread confirming that the issue is real. The only thing that's unsubstantiated is that the software patch doesn't fix it. 
But see, if you're using the Trezor as cold storage (like many people are), it's going to be on old firmware anyway. Therefore, a lot of Trezors are still going to be hackable anyway.

The important thing with paper wallets is that if you try to withdraw anything less than the full amount, your "change" goes to a different location. Being a paper wallet, it can't tell you where! 
I'm not 100% sure if anything has changed, but as far as I know this is still the case. "Sweep" means to withdraw the full balance of your paper wallet into say a mobile app wallet. Some apps have an actual "Sweep" menu option

Running a Bitcoin exchange is a very risky operation, requiring extreme security, fraud prevention and reliability. Handling the coins themselves, the cash you're exchanging it for, ensuring you've got enough at all times for trade, and dealing with the associated disputes. 
Would you offer that service for free? The truth is it's still something of a niche and there's not a lot of surviving competition. Bitcoin's own infrastructure is phenomenal, especially when you're sending and receiving bitcoin payments, but exchanging for fiat is a very different matter.  
@_date: 2017-08-03 12:24:11
No, no, no. Adopting Bitcoin and owning your private keys IS the alternative to burying your fiat in the backyard because you don't trust banks. 
@_date: 2017-08-07 14:24:12
I know you're getting flamed, but I think this needs to be taken more seriously. It's a shame people are too vitriolic to have discussions, but I guess you could have worded your sentiments less dramatically too. 
If I bought a computer with Bitcoin during the last month, there could have been a (fiat equivalent) grand of difference depending upon which day I chose to make the purchase. That means no stability for either me or the retailer, unless I automatically convert fiat to btc and then they convert btc to fiat - which isn't exactly the Bitcoin dream.
But "no longer functional" is a misnomer because we're still in Bitcoin's infancy. While it establishes value and hedges out inflationary banking, hodling will inevitably be more desirable while transactions will always be something of a novelty/experiment.
But Facebook posts used to all be a novelty, and now people coordinate their whole lives and careers through it. When the price starts to stabilise, Bitcoin can come into its own as a currency.

Your idea is great, that's exactly what I do! Mycelium for my loose change but I use a Ledger Nano S for my "savings", it's a hardware wallet so it's very secure. Your wallet codes never touch an Internet connected device and you have to touch a hardware button to authorise any transfers out of the account! 
Another option is a paper wallet but to do that properly you need to make sure the computer and printer avoid all contact with the internet. The website explains all about how to do that and why.

Sure it is used in electronics/jewellery, but people don't buy and sell bullion for that. They buy it because it holds value.

Basically the 12 or 24 word seed phrase (English words) is a backup of your public key and private key (random letters and numbers). The memorable words and their order are used to recreate the code. The hardware wallet randomly creates a key and gives you a seed phrase to write down as a backup. 
A hardware wallet keeps the private key secure and it never leaves the device. If you want to send coins, the device has to allow it to happen. It has this power because it has the private key. If you enter the memorable words into another wallet, it can recreate your private key too. 
The important thing to remember is that coins are never stored "on" the wallet, they're linked to your keys. The wallet is just an interface that lets you manipulate your coins, which are stored online. (very simplistically) 
Hope that helps!

Try Dollar Cost Averaging if you're worried. Buy a small amount every month so you lower your risk, but at the expense of getting a smaller return than if you'd gambled and it paid off.
Or gamble. Buy now with the assumption that it'll keep moving up. You could wait for a drop, but if you were good at that you'd be a millionaire.
But aways buy only what you're prepared to lose, because nobody knows the future and literally anything could happen. Tons of people were convinced that the price would plummet at the end of July but it did the opposite. The fearful dip happened in the middle of the month.

Adding to my comment earlier, hardware wallets can indeed attach to a PC, phone or tablet.
Theoretically, there is no difference in security and you can safely use a hardware wallet even on a malware-riddled device.
You need to connect the hardware wallet to your device, enter a pin, and press a hardware button to authorise any transfer out. You can check your balance and receive coin without connecting though.
Bitcoin isn't "stored" on your hardware wallet, your private keys are. This sounds pedantic, but bitcoins are something you access online using your keys to prove ownership. So if someone gets your backup words, they can get full access to your bitcoins. 
The answer to this is be very careful when storing your backup words :) Only do this with pen and paper. If you do this, your wallet is super safe. 
@_date: 2017-08-19 13:13:28
They're almost identical. 
Trezor is open source, Ledger is closed source. That doesn't matter to me, but it does to others. I went for the Ledger because of the price and form factor.
Very noob friendly. 
All a hardware wallet does is hoard your private keys safely, in a way that your keys and your multiple word seed never touch the Internet. Your keys grant you access to the coins on the blockchain. If there's a forked split of the chain, and you own your keys like this, you can always claim access to the coins on both branches of the split.

The major problem is that China is beyond essential when it comes to trade and commerce. Most westerners will never want/need to socialise with people in China via Facebook, but you'll be hard pressed to find a westerner who doesn't have an array of Chinese products in their home. 
There has been a lot of "we don't need you" bravado, but if Bitcoin is ever going to survive as a viable borderless currency, we can't just cut off the manufacturing powerhouse of the world, let alone 1 in 5 of the world population.
It will survive, but it will never reach its full potential without China. The damage will be worse than 20%.

Because it is not as simple as open = good, closed = bad.
Trezor is open source and it got hacked. There are no reports of Ledger getting hacked. Windows and mac OS are both closed source, but would you recommend Linux to everyone because the others aren't secure enough?

Facebook is a social networking site. People talk to other people who are mostly in the same town. 
China makes everything. Why would businesses choose to operate primarily in Bitcoin if their major suppliers all require fiat? Bitcoin is supposed to connect everyone, borderlessly. China can't kill bitcoin, but they can cripple it.
Again, I'm not saying bitcoin is doomed, but I think we're underestimating how significant China is to have on board.

Public ledger that is pseudo anonymous though. Not really an issue unless you can link it to the owner.

If Bitcoin is soaring, wouldn't you drop a little cash on an altcoin just in case it's the "next bitcoin"? And if the high profile and established Bitcoin is plummeting, what hope do the ambiguous altcoins have?
I've been following Bitcoin for years but I'm going to be the first to admit that I know next to nothing about Doge, Ether, Lite, etc. Until/if one becomes a runaway success, my entire opinion of the market is based around Bitcoin.

Ledger Nano S. They're effectively​ both the same, but the Ledger has a better form factor and it's about half the price. 
@_date: 2017-07-21 21:01:57
Are you looking to sell in the short term? Then now = uncertainty = assume bad. (But now is good *if* the price rockets to the moon next month)
Are you looking to sell months or years down the road? Then buy buy buy. (Or sell sell sell if the dream ends and Bitcoin plummets)
Do you love the idea of Bitcoin and intend to buy things with it and transfer coin to people? Then absolutely 100% now (and always). 
@_date: 2017-07-21 11:44:26
For many, cryptocurrency is a vision for the future, a completely new and exciting way of doing things. That's what is debating here. 
The fact that you consider Bitcoin as nothing more than an asset like one of your properties is fine, by all means ride it to the moon with the rest of us.
But perhaps you shouldn't hijack productive conversation just so you can talk about yourself. This sub clearly isn't for you, head over to perhaps.

Aren't hardware wallets/USB drives/SD cards all ultimately relying on the same flash technology though? 
@_date: 2017-07-24 14:51:47
One thing that I rarely see mentioned is just the sheer brand factor of Bitcoin. It's not only well known, but it's accepted in a lot of places. While not impossible, I don't see any altcoin getting the same traction any time soon. 
Bitcoin may have its shortcomings, but anyone who remembers Betamax, HD-DVD and MiniDisc knows that this isn't important.

The passphrase is like a translation of your private key code which is a long, secure jumble of letters and numbers. It's universal among all wallets because it's like a "passport" that declares you as the owner of your transactions on the bitcoin network.
So instead of a secret code like A=Z, B=Y etc, think "concern elephant" = "1jfh65456g", "elephant concern" = "hgh253op35" etc. The choice of words and their order determine the code in a predictable way. This works because there are a mind boggling number of ways in which 24 or even 12 words can be ordered.
The key and phrase can be 'translated' both ways using this system, and of course it's easier to make a note of a list of words than to write down a long strip of nonsense.

Mycelium and Coinomi are software wallets, there is absolutely no comparison.
Phone hacking is a very real risk, just look at how many celebrities have had their nudes leaked. Hacking a hardware wallet requires physically handling the device. 
Will you *probably* be safe with a software wallet? Yes. But you'd probably be safe if you etched your pin number onto your credit card too. 
@_date: 2017-07-19 22:59:08
Good call! Personally I use a hardware wallet, partly because I feel like a secret agent plugging a device into my other device. Similarly I "watch" on a wallet app that lets me receive but not send.

"Why I will never buy bitcoin again" 
Please, don't post nonsense like this on the Internet. **You** made a number of mistakes, and a PayPal scam is what stung you in the end.
I'm sorry to hear of your experience, but Bitcoin has nothing to do with it, so don't try to scare people.

A wise man could "restore" both of those half-seeds and perform a few transactions with them in order to make them seem like legitimate accounts.
Combine that with a passphrase for your 24 word seed and you're about as obfuscated as you can get
@_date: 2017-07-22 14:15:09
All these delays happen completely behind the scenes and most people don't even know or care about them. When you use a credit card it's effortless, instant and anxiety-free. Bitcoin has not quite reached that point yet. 
One of the founders of the internet spoke recently about how he dreams of the internet being as transparent as electricity. There are power stations, relays, fuseboxes, mains rings, voltages, surges, risks, etc - but in the real world, you just plug it in and it's there. 
@_date: 2017-07-25 13:27:27
No, they're saved on a device that is permanently connected to the internet and is now the world's number one target for malware. 
Hardware Wallet keys are stored only on a piece of secure offline equipment that requires you to physically enter a pin number then press a button to make a transfer.
@_date: 2017-07-23 12:48:49
That's why I said effectively. There is no difference in terms of functionality and security to the end user. 
@_date: 2017-07-26 19:16:59
Ledger are so confident in their security measures that they don't even put a tamper evident seal on the Nano S anymore. When you use their software it verifies that the product hasn't been tampered with, and they even provide you with instructions on how to disassemble the device and check for tampering. 
@_date: 2017-07-22 15:05:51
I know that, you know that, but confirmations and handling private keys is completely alien and scary to 99% of people. All credit card users need to worry about is remembering  their pin number. And if anything goes wrong there's a 24/7 hotline to call.

This is where is gets a bit complex, but essentially you've got it!
I've heard some wallets store your key on their servers, but heavily encrypted. Ideally you want one that puts you in full control of your key (ie. You need the passphrase to restore your wallet on your app if you wipe because your keys never touch the server), and a paper wallet is the pinnacle of that. 
If you're extremely paranoid, you can generate a paper wallet on a machine that has never touched the internet so you can almost guarantee nobody is snooping.
If you're reasonably paranoid, you can get a hardware wallet like the Ledger Nano S or the Trezor. These generate and store your keys on an encrypted offline device, so the only way you can send coins is to plug it in to your device and press a button to authorise the transaction.
On these hardware wallets, you can take their own backup passphrase (displayed only on the wallet's own screen) and enter it into something like Breadwallet, and it will immediately generate your full wallet on there. Of course this defeats the object, because a hacker could observe you entering the phrase or hack your phone and steal your key from the app (in theory). 
The tldr is: your keys declare ownership of a series of transactions on the bitcoin network. Whoever controls the keys controls your coins, so it's best to have as much control over them as possible. Apps are convenient but less secure, hardware/paper is the reverse, but the core principle is always the same. Wallet apps are just convenient ways of handling your keys. 
@_date: 2017-07-26 09:00:59
You can do whatever works for you by all means, but burning CDs and maintaining old hardware seems a lot more effort to me than writing down 12 words. It's also a lot easier to hide three pieces of ziplock-bagged paper.
ALL electronic storage has a potential shelf life. I'd never assume a written CD was reliable for more than 5-10 years. In contrast, I've got pristine pieces of paper that I handwrote nearly 30 years ago. 
@_date: 2017-07-23 09:49:39
I use the Ledger Nano S and it's superior in my opinion - nicer form factor, half the price, same security, does literally everything the Trezor does. Absolute no-brainer when I chose it.      
@_date: 2017-07-23 11:11:14
 If I had to keep my key in only one place, I'd buy one of these. Fireproof, waterproof etc - just make sure you stash it somewhere like under your floorboards if you're worried about theft! 
Best option? And I'm very serious here - put aside 20 minutes a day to memorise your seed. You'll be surprised how achievable this is!

You'd get similar impressions about fiat if you hung out on People love to discuss saving/profit, but they're less likely to announce "I paid for a VPN with bitcoin this morning". 
Check out - people are using it! But I fully agree with your sentiment. It's like the 10,000BTC for two pizzas story - sure those coins would be an immense fortune now, but stuff like those pizza purchases needed to happen for the coin to become valuable anyway.

To oversimplify, Bitcoin infrastructure is comparable to a torrent. Every node is a "seed" that hosts a regularly updated 100GB+ file. Hosting a node is something anyone can theoretically do, but it means processing 1MB blocks, which uses multiple GB of your internet bandwidth every month. 
The current issue is that the system gets clogged up too easily. One "solution" is doubling the 1MB block size to 2MB, but this increases the bandwidth cost to people running nodes.
The nightmare scenario from increasing block size to match demand is that ultimately only large "bank" servers will be able to run as nodes, which kinda defeats the point.
