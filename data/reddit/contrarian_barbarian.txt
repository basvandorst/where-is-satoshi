Exchange Traded Fund. It's kind of like a hybrid of a stock and a mutual or index fund.

You say that as a joke, but there was a story a couple weeks back about a student being suspended for mentioning Bitcoin in class, and the teachers claimed that they must be talking about drugs since that was all it was used for.

My day job is in DOD Information Assurance. *It is my job* to be worried about security vulnerabilities in VMs, and all of our guidance documentation calls for treating VMs with the same security posture as full physical systems. Linux is much better than Windows (we use RHEL whenever possible), but there are vulnerabilities, like Heartblead and Shellshock.

[Unlike Taco Bell]( The double cheeseburger at McDonalds is really one of the better deals in fast food - it's priced barely above the ingredients, and the ingredients are fairly decent.

And cooling. Keep it cool (less than 70c under full load), and it shouldn't degrade it that much.

It's still a separate OS to maintain. Yes, you need to maintain a VM just as much as a full installation - it's just as vulnerable to security threats as any physical machine.

They wouldn't necessarily lose the lawsuits due to the ToS, but there's nothing to stop people from actually bringing suit no matter what the terms are. Even if it ends up getting thrown out in the end, lawsuits are expensive.

Unless is shot back up after the article was posted, I saw something saying it had been down 12% for the day.

Most dice are cheaply made. Casinos spend a lot more per dice than most people. You can usually tell something of the quality of a set of dice by the edges - typically sharper edged dice are better quality because they are harder to produce. OP's dice have very soft edges, kind of like standard D&amp;D dice, which do not tend to be even remotely balanced.
