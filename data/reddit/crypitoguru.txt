 Time to bust out my old radeon and add to this mining craziness)) And to do it, I search for interesting projects, first of all I look at partners, also, official website, team, advisors, token, whitepaper, availability of escrow and much more. Visually, sometimes you can understand where a good project, and where not very much! An important factor is the availability of the product or MVP. As an example, you can see the Socratus project [

 Coffee and a cigarette, works better than laxatives it seems. I feel pretty optimistic about Bitcoin currently . Yes things look bad again all currencies have experienced the same. Let's not panic people. Bitcoin is going to pick up.   I aslo want to share with you my inside - Socratus,  a platform for insurance companies that was created in order to make the communication between customer and insurance company more convenient and simple. Having studied the project I can say that it is reliable, has a transparent team . They seem really interesting but would love to hear your opinion

 LOL: "Novelist at Self-Employed." I'd better share with you a really cool Socratus project! They have a really fascinating concept - a platform for insurance companies that was created in order to make the communication between customer and insurance company more convenient and simple. Interesting, is not it? So, I studied this project and besides an interesting idea I can also say that it is very promising for investments.
