This is an extremely poor analogy to be honest. Most people have no access to getting into the NFL or ever playing football even.
Games are readily available for you to play. Of course not everyone is good at games, and there is some kind of similarity in certain contexts here, but completely different things for the most part.
I don't understand why so many people watch random streamers, but it is evident most of these people are kids aka millenials.

Stop acting like this is some art lol. It's mostly kids swearing at random shit. You all think this stuff is so amazing. Most people think it is stupid as shit and a clear waste of someone's priorities and time. Deal with it.
Most of these fucking watchers are kids. Kids that don't even play games half the time. They ain't getting better at games.

Retards generally.

Okay you had a point before how people watch too much streaming, but it's apparent you jumped off the deep end here. Shit costs money fool.

Yeah the spread the word OMG a person who is good at gaming! LIKE OMG.

Haha it's funny seeing the downvotes, but in general this is how millenials function. I will never understand the watching people game type thing, but it is what it is.

In effect people addicted to reddit are probably some of the same types of people that watch streamers all day. It really is a weird thing to me anyway, but I know it is what it is. No use in fighting it really. I do tend to think watching people play random games is a kiddie thing unless you are watching to get better yourself.

I'm not against streaming at all. Why would I logically be against something so harmless for the most part? I am against people just watching streams and doing nothing else though. That isn't a good lifestyle.

No shit this is like tween central here folks. The average age of people watching others play videogames is super low. This is strictly a young millenial thing for the vast majority of people.

You sound like a whiny bitch with problems, princess.
Judging by your name you are also a fucking idiot.

These threads are hilarious. PROUD GUYS! SO PROUD!

Indoctrinate your kids lol. Maybe let them decide themselves?

You people honestly think the banking cartel is going to let this flourish. That is your first mistake.
