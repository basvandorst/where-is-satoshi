Easily one of the best mastering studios in the game for glitch hop, bass music...and ANY electronic music for that matter.  This is huge.

Google depends on consumer trust more than you realize.  If they have to share anything with the government I imagine they only do so when mandated.

I suppose that is the extent of your rebuttal?

Not at all.  Nor does anyone have to respect him.  It's really not a big deal.  
@_date: 2017-05-27 16:48:30
It's not a bad comparison.  Both seem to be spoiled rich kids.

Meaning he didn't earn any of it.

That's awesome.  Though, anyone who wants to keep less than 2500 in their account might see advantages to bitcoin.  
Many poor people cannot even afford to have bank accounts because work is unsteady/a variety of other reasons, and often end up taking any paychecks to a Money Mart...paying huge fees to cash them.
Bitcoin wasn't just made for people wealthy enough to have more than 2500 in their account.  It was made for everyone.

Except that banks are allowed to sell MUCH more gold than they have/could ever pay out.

Most economists agree there is another global crash coming.  Or at least a hefty amount of inflation.

And yet certain things would cost money I imagine.  Wire transfers to other accounts at other banks, email money transfers, etc.

"You cannot use PayPal in a way that violates their Terms of Service."
My point exactly.  I think it is pretty obvious that donating to wikileaks is neither illegal nor immoral.

What if I told you that donating to charities isn't as selfish and low as you seem to think?
It's a forward thinking idea and a good demonstration of the merits of bitcoin.

Living up to your username I see.
@_date: 2013-12-18 18:13:00
Have you forgotten about the time they froze accounts for donating to wikileaks?

Oh come on.  It was designed as a deflationary currency, and it was designed to have an incentive for people to jump in before it was widely adopted.  It's a completely valid, and clever, solution to a chicken vs egg problem.  As if 'for prophet' banks are ever going to be cheaper than bitcoins...ever....not likely.

You are building a straw man.  I haven't even remotely insinuated that.  I am fully aware of the tendencies of self interested banks.  Which is why I think bitcoin is so important.

My local credit unions definitely have fees, especially for debit card use.
@_date: 2013-12-09 09:41:33
Are most banks like this?  Because I live in Canada and no banks near me are free for debit card use, low account amounts etc...
