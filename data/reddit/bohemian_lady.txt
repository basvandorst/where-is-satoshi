Still no invites, I think they are catching up. Last I checked they accidentally gave out more invites than they had phones for. Also haven't been able to check the last day or two... I live in Hawaii so you know hurricane and all.
In other news... my Phone should be here tomorrrow!

No its not the same, unless you have a money tree growing in your back yard. I can't justify buying a bitcoin for $300, which is more than all of my bill combined. Where as in 2011 I could easily justify spending that weeks beer money on some bitcoin.

Right, on sale. $99.99 is the crossed out number next to that am I wrong? If they were always priced at $35 plus shipping for two 750ml bottles that would be great. This may simply be poor site design, you may have intended for that to represent the price that other people sell it for. In which case put that in the description and get rid of the giant red SALE spot that pops up when you scroll over.
@_date: 2014-08-04 16:51:06
I can has color coins? And how do they work?

... because $100.00 for 2 500ml bottles of mead is insane! Mead is a quick fermenting drink, it doesn't take long to make and its not hard. I could contact friends of mine and have them ship out 2 750ml bottles for $50. Hell for [$100 worth of equipment I could make my own.](
This is really sad because I wanted to buy from you and become a regular customer but I can't because its too expensive...

The Higher-ups in the banking industry are only interested in cash monies. They see bitcoin as a way to make massive profits, weather they hold or pump &amp; dump is irrelevant at this point. 
We all know this, the key is to bitcoin being a Trojan horse is adoption. We want the banks to start using bitcoin, if banks use it then the general public will be more comfortable with it. Proliferation becomes the word of the day. Once the general public sees how much better a decentralized currency is the hope is that a good number of them, how many I can't guess, will decide not to use the bank controlled system. Making the banks obsolete.
If the banks are obsolete everyone will be better off... I'm sure someone has a more eloquent way to explain it but thats the long and short.

As soon as they start giving out invites again, I don't have any on my account as of yet. Depending on availability I should have access to invites in a couple days.
@_date: 2015-09-07 03:49:50
I offer it as a payment option when available. Often sites that use tokens and such frown on out side payment methods because they don't get a cut.
[Strip Arcade]( however accepts bitcoin as a payment option for clients and offers to pay out to models in bitcoin as well.
@_date: 2013-04-14 03:35:54
As good a reason as any in my opinion!
@_date: 2013-04-06 18:56:23
If you have any suggestions for hosting that can be bought with bitcoins we would be open to such suggestions. Right now we are starting with a Wordpress, we ended up buying the domain with fiat due to the urgency of having possession of the name. That being said we are going to publish our process as a sort of how to so any suggestions on domain companies that accept bitcoins would also be appreciated.
@_date: 2013-04-11 01:53:17
We are currently operating with BTC as the majority of our expenses. See [this post]( for a more in-depth explanation.

Bagsforbitcoins is [part business part pet project]( We aren't just selling really awesome dice bags, using the recently open sourced Dragon Chow design, for bitcoins.
Whats different about our bags? Well we print the designs on them ourselves, in fact we are willing to print anything you like on the bags. Barring anything illegal of coarse. We will also be doing our best to run this project on just Bitcoins, at this point the only Fiat spent on this project has been for the start up materials. 
We will be documenting all the services that make this possible via blog, so that others in our position can feel empowered to start their own bitcoin ventures. So feel free to pop over and take a look. We are open to suggestions about features and functionality, which my partner will be implementing as we get them. If you know any other places that we should announce this please drop me a line. We are already announcing in multiple subreddits but any suggestions are welcome.

I've made a tidy sum in BTC through In fact most of my bitcoins were made through tips.
@_date: 2013-04-13 19:32:01
Thats what I do, blockchain.info that address and make sure it holds the amount of BTC that it should. Although I was not aware that moving a portion of BTC out of my paper wallets wasn't a thing. My question is if I wanted to use the QR code to spend say 0.05 BTC, is that possible? Or should I just plan on trasfering the whole amount into my spending wallet then moving the portion I don't want to spend onto a new paper wallet. The later was my initial plan, though the constant flow of new information changes my mind for me every few minutes!
@_date: 2013-04-13 21:09:30
Mmm I only keep small amounts of BTC in any one paper wallet so I think I'll stick to importing the whole amount then sending the remaining BTC to a new paper wallet. Just do I don't have to deal with finding the change wallet! 
@_date: 2013-04-11 00:41:23
Theres a ticker that shows at the bottom of your browser window... The one I use is a [firefox addon](

Those aren't "bad" they are hideous!  and  are barley passable but they are still bad. Some one should have posted this contest to that way we had some half decent choices!
@_date: 2013-04-06 19:16:59
I believe Forlarren already sent you a PM about the bags. We will definitely be making posts **everywhere** once we are online, we're just waiting for a little breathing space. Theres a lot of BTC news out there right now and we would just get lost in the noise.
@_date: 2013-04-11 00:05:37
Saw a couple like that this morning. The two back o back 24,000 BTC transactions were crazy!
@_date: 2013-04-13 19:03:12
I had the same questions and in short blockchain.info is where you can view the wallets content. Paper wallets are storage wallets, you would use the private key or the QR code that goes with it to spend your BTC. Since I haven't moved BTC from my paper wallets I'm a little hazy on this, but I'm guessing that when I'm ready I'll just use blockchain.infos QR code reader to move my BTC into a spending wallet.
Edit: Read [this]( 
@_date: 2013-04-13 22:50:11
Lol I know right!
@_date: 2013-04-11 00:33:24
Nah, what I want is for Max to implement a way to tell the difference between sell and buy transactions. You can know the price with an API ticker in your browser window, but can you Imagen the potential symphony if Max changed the sell transactions to a flute or something! Now **that** would be cool!
Yes, I already emailed him.

Honestly I don't know either, I'm not a voyeur. Maybe its a combination of their own anonymity with my apparent vulnerability. Maybe they are agoraphobes and this is the only way they get to have the striper experience. Who knows, it's their sexuality not mine.

Haha, you didn't look at my account history did you? Well all that aside this is just to distract those that would like it. Theres a lot of newbies about and I know as a new redditor I didn't check the side bar, so this is more of a PSA. If you like it, cool. If you don't cool. I don't care.
@_date: 2013-04-05 23:16:59

@_date: 2013-04-06 19:12:12
Yeah everyone is kind of stuck in the Fiat limbo right now, but we'll get to a point where you can buy anything with bitcoin. Just got a persevere. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 01:04:40
I wouldn't, after having seen unauthorized sales happen during yesterdays fiasco I transfered the remainder of my BTC out of my Mt Gox account. I'm not going to use them anymore.
@_date: 2013-04-11 19:42:47
Seriously bitaddress.org I know lots of people are saying that but its true. and its really easy. This is the recommended way to do it.
1. Go to [bitaddress.org]( 
2. Save the whole page in your documents folder.
3.Close your browser and turn off your Wifi or unplug your internet cable.
4. Restart your computer, this is a must if you are using windows. It is also recommended that you restart your printer, some of them have wifi access.
5. Once your computer has booted back up open the saved [bitaddress.org]( (Make sure you are **not** connected to the internet) Create as many new wallet addresses as you would like then print them out. Print at least two copies and keep one with your records and one in a safe place.
Congratulations you now have a secure off line wallet. Any time you want to transfer your bitcoins from your on line wallet just type in your paper wallets public address and send the coins there. If you don't want to have to type them out you can always keep the public address in a password storage program like Keypass. Make sure its the public keys only!! You do not want the privet keys to be stored digitally this will compromise them.
@_date: 2013-03-18 18:37:55
Thank you I'll bookmark that.
@_date: 2013-04-12 18:41:50
I really can't wait for [Materia]( to launch their bitcoin cam site. I love [cam4btc]( but its so glitchie and the back end company for strip 4 bit doesn't pay out in BTC.

Thats why we started supporting bitcoins, well its why I started accepting bitocins. Porn has a history of leading the way in adopting new technologies. I want to be one of the few, because trust me most "professional girls" are leery of accepting bitcoins, on the ground level accepting bitcoins for my services. If I accept them and show the girls that are leery that bitcoins can work then they will be more likely to accept them.

@_date: 2013-03-18 18:49:30


We may have to do that.


We bought the e-book "A laywers take on bitcoins and taxes" which recommends keeping as accurate a record as possible since there are a couple of ways that Bitcoins can figure into our taxes. SO for accurate record keeping we need to know what the value of the transaction was at the time that it happened. If we have to go with the value of the transaction at market closing time we will, but if we can have more accurate records we probably should.


Our records for the business will be two fold, bitcoin and a USD translation. So yes we will be keeping track of our profitability in USD as well as bitcoins. Sorry if this is all jumbled... I'm still on my first cup of coffee. 
@_date: 2013-05-13 20:40:07
Awesome, thanks for the suggestion.
