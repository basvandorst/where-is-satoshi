To add to that, this issue was discussed in the NY dept of finance hearings. ONLY when the state was contemplating requiring identifiers to be attached to wallets (to keep in compliance with standing KYC and AML laws). That would then create the issue you've proposed. However, that regulation isn't on the table yet.

Also, little secret, I'm launching a moderately sized company in a matter of weeks. 10% of my profits are going to go to this organization. I don't just talk the talk, I walk the walk.

1 Tactic I would use is making all of their information public. I'd do it to Mark Karpeles. But, a, I don't think he has ran off with anyones coins (yet at least). And, b, I wasn't silly enough to keep my btc on mtgox, or any exchange for an extended period of time for that matter.

Thanks :) 
Weird reality, I find it much easier to make cash than to garner help for a noteworthy cause. I'd say that I'm just gonna make a boatload and donate myself, but I was already planning on it.

Lol, I'm mining in windows 7.

Have you tried mining a cpu based alt coin?
@_date: 2014-02-01 01:35:05
They can cash out from multiple addresses. You trolling, or do you seriously not get this?
@_date: 2014-02-15 01:23:14
Try these, they're limited to cpu mining so you should be able to remain competitive. The difference in hash rates between cpus isn't much. I'm sure most of them at the least, should be profitable (outweigh power cost). Worth a shot :)

Too much negative energy around bitcoin now, between the FUD, porn, manipulation, etc. 
It's really not a good look. So I present to you my multifaceted bitcoin mood flipping opportunity! Please read:
One night, I was enjoying a slice of pizza with some friends in downtown Orlando. The night of the superbowl actually. 
As I was leaving I the women next to me, asked if I could donate to the charitable organization she worked with. Unfortunately donation amounts exceeded the cash I had in my pocket at the time. But the flyer she handed me caught my eye for 2 reasons. 1, it was a not for profit set up to give underprivileged kids the opportunity to learn computer programming. 2, It had a qr code. 
Unfortunately, that qr code wasn't for a btc wallet. In fact they weren't acccepting btc donations at all at the time. I took about 10 minutes to give the ELI5 version to the woman, before I realized that my friends had left me a long time ago and I was in danger of losing my ride, lol. I decided to end off with letting her know that she should tell the owner of the organization to accept bitcoin donations, as I was sure it would receive huge support from the bitcoin community. She said 'well you can tell him yourself' and gestured over to the man sitting the table over, whom I earlier noticed was intrigued by the discussion. 
That's when I met Troy. He spearheads the operation. On top of his job as a college professor. He told me he was familiar with bitcoin, but unaware of the recent systems that have come about, making them more user friendly (primarily coinbase). 
Troy told me he was going to implement a way to accept bitcoin donations, asap. I told him if he did, I would surely be the first to donate.
I looked into his organization, they are as legit as they come. And the vibe I got from Troy was that he was a truly great person, looking to help others. Even better, they already receive support from Microsoft. Microsoft not only let's them work in one of their nicest locations (mall at millenia, orlando), but they also aid with hardware donations. I discovered this at the time the whole apple debacle was going on. I thought it was fitting considering Microsoft has an unspoken affinity for bitcoin.
Anyway, a couple days later, Troy had implemented the bitcoin code into his site. I followed through on my word, and promptly made their first bitcoin donation.
Cool thing is btc started dropping right after. Not that I haven't shorted bitcoin before, but this way of cashing out at top, just felt good :)
Anyways, If you guys would like to help Troy and the kids he works with out, and trust me this guy has his boots on the ground and is making a real difference, their website is:
I like the organization not only for the Microsoft irony, and the coincidence. But I believe this helps communities around me in two-fold, the location based community I call Orlando, and the web based community I call bitcoin (who knows he may be teaching our next btc developer!). I also like that this is a well established not for profit, and not some pop up charity attempt to get bitcoin. Go to their site, take a look, show support in anyway you want.
I'm hoping the donations make enough of an impact to the point where Troy integrates bitcoin into his curriculum. Maybe, just maybe. I'll be sure to come back and let you know the level of support that is shown. Thanks for listening to my story.

If an exchange ran off with my money, I'd find the owners. Skiptracing is a helluva thing. Coming from a family of debt collectors, I'd make sure operators wouldn't sleep well at night.

Mining doge nah nah nah :P

First off... this is why overstock.com's stock is plummeting:  (4th quarter numbers)
Not btc related at all.
Also, what's to stop overstock.com from generating multiple addresses? Have you ever used bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-02-15 00:42:12
As to what, my business? It's cryptocurrency related. 
The real secret is that I don't want Troy to know, at least not yet, until I've had a chance to talk to him about it.

Been mining since close to it's inception. Was nice getting 150k a day. Also, dogecoin is in the only altcoin, imo, in a long term uptrend. Any time I've switched miners just to see doge jump the next week I've found myself in regret. Long term sticking with doge is what has worked best so far. When that changes, I'll adjust. 
Even after halving it is still one of (and at times) the most profitable coin to mine.
