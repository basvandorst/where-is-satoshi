Never said it was a guarantee but this is not the end of it. This is not "the crash" as this has happened the last 4 years in the beginning of January.
@_date: 2018-01-21 23:54:51
It is approximately a 50% correction which is pretty standard and it could go all the way down to 61% still being standard. Not to mention if you look at the charts this happens every single year in the first two weeks of January. Literally, look it up
@_date: 2018-01-21 23:59:09
Well then I have no idea why you're "gambling" on it if you think it will fail. I'm betting on the fact that crypto (btc) will give the US dollar a run for its money as the Global Currency. Which is a much longer game then just a few Corrections
@_date: 2018-01-21 23:32:05
Crypto is not crashing and if you can't handle this mild correction then you should cash out now and save yourself

A unused phone in a safe has always been a good alternative to a hardware wallet. There's no way that it will be as secure as a hardware wallet but it still keeps your fun safe as long as it's not connected to the internet all the time

I think it actually references the ark line(logarithmaric regression) that Bitcoin has been following since its Inception. Because I believe that's what McAfee based his prediction off of

@_date: 2018-10-14 18:49:43
Depends on way too many different variables for you to make blanket statements like this.
@_date: 2018-06-28 16:17:37
So I looked it up and apparently they were using coinbase Merchant  payment system  which stopped working for them. Nothing to do with fees or bs that you suggest. In fact it looks like you can still pay with Bitcoin just some customers are having trouble with it. 
You're still talking because you're trying to justify lies and propaganda that you're trying to spread. That's why lol. By the way you have failed to come up with one example of a merchant that stopped using Bitcoin ��
@_date: 2018-06-28 00:54:05
You have over 12 million dollars in Bitcoin and don't know how to cash it out? I find that very hard to believe
@_date: 2018-06-28 16:21:33
"Some community members suggested that they cancelled accepting Bitcoin due to Coinbase’s decisionto suspend custodial solutions for merchants"
Because we all know how cheap Bitcoin is to use if you're not a complete moron. Had nothing to do with that and had everything to do with their partner coinbase changing the rules
@_date: 2018-06-28 10:08:25
Zoom out on those charts big guy lol
@_date: 2018-06-28 18:17:00
Certainly not because of fees you fuking idiot. Stop spreading false information. If I had to speculate it would be because of taxes and different internet laws that are changing. Just because your trashy coin sucks, that doesn't mean you have to try to bring down Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-06-28 01:20:01
WTF are you talking about? Fees are low especially on segwit wallets
@_date: 2018-06-24 16:52:24
Loving optimism but it's too early to be like that. Let's actually build a support
@_date: 2018-06-28 13:25:12
Doesn't sound like it. Last year there were issues with fees but the last six months there has been none. Perhaps you need to upgrade to a segwit wallet and save yourself some fees. Don't be so sure that you've done anything more than me( other than spread propaganda I'm sure you do that a lot) cuz you sound like a moron.
@_date: 2018-06-28 13:52:51
Why don't you name some then? Jackass, keep showing you have no idea what you're talking about LOL 
@_date: 2018-06-28 01:12:13
Does this not happen once per year?
@_date: 2018-06-28 10:17:51
Bear markets react more too bad news then they do good news. It goes the other way also as you saw in December. No bad news could hold the bitcoin down during that last bull run.
@_date: 2018-06-28 18:53:13
You are so full of shit. Try actually using Bitcoin before spouting nonsense. It's very cheap. Little to No fees. The more you spout nonsense, the more I don't think you've ever used BTC in your life. Fuk off already
@_date: 2018-06-28 14:33:17
Are you? At what point did any of those people except Bitcoin?
Edit: I looked and still accept them as payment lol oops
Those are very bad examples of people who are no longer accepting btc as they still do apparently.
@_date: 2018-06-28 10:06:31
So I take it you haven't even used Bitcoin? The fees are extremely low and that is a fact. What merchants have been abandoning Bitcoin? Go back to the btrash sub..
@_date: 2018-06-17 01:44:31
Yes Bitcoin is very fast and cheap. Give us some specifics on how much you paid and how long it took with a transaction hash or get the hell out of here
@_date: 2018-03-15 00:26:49
You shouldn't hate coinbase. They have horrible customer service but other than that they have any good Exchange and everything works for me so I can't complain
@_date: 2018-03-11 02:39:50
They claim there is a 1.6% Network fee associated with Bitcoin when that's actually their fee. At the same time they claim that there is a 0% Network fee associated with Bitcoin cash which again is there fee. It's extremely misleading and makes it sound like Bitcoin cash is free to use whereas Bitcoin cost a percentage of transaction
@_date: 2018-03-04 16:27:19
I missed the part where they said they were going to suspend anything. Suspend what by the way?
@_date: 2018-03-11 13:45:32
This  says it's between 0.20- $0.70 to send Bitcoin with no mention of percentage( because that is complete BS). Are you actually looking at the information you sending links to?
@_date: 2018-03-11 13:23:29
As the previous person said it has nothing to do with percentage. You're skewing things like Roger would. You can send as little as one Satoshi per bite.
@_date: 2018-03-11 13:19:56
Current transaction fees are nowhere near this high. Try again
@_date: 2018-02-22 02:05:43
The last two withdrawals I had from gdax took about 24 hours. Not instant though unless you have a card attached to your coinbase account
@_date: 2018-02-27 01:25:25
I remember when they were paying a 50% premium on that side of the world just a few months back. 5% is looking pretty good
@_date: 2018-02-27 00:46:26
Wait... you can't withdraw the crypto you purchase from there? What is the point?
@_date: 2018-02-22 02:25:41
No I was saying the pay card that lets you use your crypto as a debit card. There's one you can attach to your coinbase account.
Unless you have the crypto debit then you have to withdraw to your bank. Only took me 24 hours the last two times though. Maybe I'm lucky
@_date: 2018-02-19 17:20:58
They haven't done anything while they've been in office so what makes you think that they are going to regulate blockchain or crypto? Trump literally hasn't even hired half of his staff and three-quarters of the people working at the White House don't have permanent security clearance...

ulcers? Lol
@_date: 2018-07-22 17:06:24
I find it amusing how very little you know about anything.
@_date: 2018-07-22 03:33:01
That was very big of fox to recognize Trump as a traitor during his meeting with Putin. But they feed so much false information to ignorant folk such as yourself on a daily basis that recognizing when Trump does something that bad doesn't really make up for it.
Your dumb ass can't even follow a story much less fact check something so you have no right to call anything fake news.
@_date: 2018-07-22 17:00:55
They've actually proven that Obamacare helps reduce the inflation of the insurance costs. The fact that they still went up every year does it mean that they would not have done it three times as much without the Affordable Care Act which I'm sure your underwear is the same thing as Obamacare and ��. You're a liar in Chief said that he was going to give everybody insurance that was cheaper and covered more but he hasn't fact destroyed Healthcare even worse than anyone could have dreamed. They have not repealed or replaced because they have their head so far up their ass they have no idea what's going on just like you
@_date: 2018-07-15 23:47:27
Some of those fees are from exchanges not using segwit or batched transactions. I send and receive Bitcoin the time and it takes me about $0.50 per transaction with a segwit wallet. Try sending some and see for yourself instead of crying about the fees that don't even exist.
@_date: 2018-07-22 02:44:59
So did you buy $2.50 worth? Lol
@_date: 2018-07-22 03:29:57
In fact you were probably not even old enough to vote in that election. I was around for Bush senior and neither of them are shit compared to Trump. I never once saw either one of them undermine the freedom of speech or try to stifle the media and lie to Americans on a daily basis. If you knew anything you know Cheney was the real problem anyway, Bush jr was just a puppet and truly nothing to worry about. Trump is a puppet as well but for a foreign power that hates us
@_date: 2018-07-16 01:10:20
Are you referring to segwit adoption? What do you mean with no lightning Network? Lightning network has been working successfully for quite some time and transactions are practically free once a line has been created. If people haven't upgraded to a segwit wallet then they are wasting money. I do not believe we will see high Bitcoin prices until we add a few zeros to the price.
@_date: 2018-07-22 03:31:24
I actually listened to what that guy said and have read up on it, no one ever said anything along those lines.
Only a moronic trumptard would get this out of it. He's probably quoting Rush Limbaugh or that ass hat from Infowars

That's how he gets you isn't it? You guys believe the stupidest conspiracies and are therefore the most gullible sheep on the planet. I bet you one of those people who believed in pizzagate ����
Though you can somehow justify the actual conspiracy that's right in your face. Trump is a Putin's puppet
@_date: 2018-07-22 16:44:04
You can go all day about pedophilia apparently. That's the only thing that you're talking about... He did not cut taxes for you or anybody I know. He cut taxes for corporations in the extremely wealthy look it up. Google is your friend. He does not have the most women his cabinet perhaps you should look that up as well. He has one woman in his cabinet after the office slut left( Hope Hicks) now he has Sarah Huckabee Sanders who is a vial liar and a traitor to our country as well. And Nikki Haley goes horribly ignorant and under qualify to be at the UN. If you count Obama had many more women in his service, just look at a picture of their cabinet meetings��. You guys make up some of the silliest lies and then scream fake news every time you don't like the truth
So basically you think that he is stopping  child sex traffickers and that he cut taxes? And that makes him the best president in modern history? Name one thing that he has actually done to stop sex trafficking or increase the number of arrests. Just one, he does not get credit four problems that exist and that are being dealt with by agencies that he is reducing funding or discrediting like the FBI
@_date: 2018-07-16 02:18:21
If one person paid $50 to send Bitcoin that does not mean there was $50 fees. You choose your fee and they chose to high of a fee. Stop trying to spread misinformation and fear where there is none. Are you trying to shill for another coin? Because you don't seem to be accepting the answers that are given to you or the reality of the situation. You seem to have a one-track mind and that track is to spread misinformation and uncertainty
@_date: 2018-07-16 03:42:51
I don't pay nearly that much and I just sent some to my ledger yesterday so your "numbers" are off. Perhaps your source is biase 
@_date: 2018-07-22 02:40:35
Let me guess you would prefer Infowars or Fox? Just because you don't want to believe it does not make it untrue you idiot. You are a straight-up traitor to our country if you buy in and repeat this garbage like our treasonous president.
@_date: 2018-07-18 10:55:10
Thanks buddy!
Same thing happened to me the last time Litecoin went up to 400. I sold half of what I had and the very next day it's shot up about 100%. I bought back my previous positions once it went under 100 so I'm good to go. Hopefully you get back in before the prices get too crazy.
@_date: 2018-07-22 16:53:04
So now you're justifying him fucking up our country and claiming he's taking care of the corruption that he is in fact creating? You sure do have to play some mental Olympics to come up with that garbage. You should seriously go get your tinfoil hat and your magic ball so you can make up some more garbage ����
You are completely delusional and treasonous. Look at all of the corruption in his current cabinet from Pruitt who is literally being indicted for corruption and illegal spending and Accepting bribes from lobbyists.
And then there's also Ben Carson he was also being investigated for spending $30,000 of taxpayers money on a freaking table amongst other things. He literally took somebody from oil companies and put them in charge of our EPA. He took somebody in charge of private and charter schools and put them in charge of our education system. Why are you too stupid to see that he is literally working for Putin to try to destroy our country. He is no stable genius and neither are you��
Trump spends just as much time golfing as he does working and he has spent millions of dollars of taxpayers money for Secret Service Air Force One trips when traveling to his own resorts to spend taxpayer money. This is by far the most corrupt Administration that our country has ever seen. Ticket from Trump even called himself a regime during the Helsinki news conference
@_date: 2018-07-22 20:13:28

Name one good thing that he's done
@_date: 2018-07-22 16:37:07
Name one good thing he's done for the American people.
 His trade Wars are devastating farmers and costing us tons of jobs, his tax plan only helps rich people and gives a very small amount to the semi wealthy for a fixed amount of time. He literally helped China's Telecom company out over our own companies and has sided with Putin over our own intelligence communities which are basically our Armed Forces. He is a traitor and anyone who still thinks that he's a good president is also treasonous. Stop drinking the Kool-Aid and try paying attention to what's actually going on you might find it a little scary comrade.

@_date: 2018-07-22 16:59:24
Yeah good for you  but I bet it has nothing to do with Trump or his tax plan.  If you have a kid you be getting a lot less because the tax credit was cut in half  for starters amongst other things.  They actually cut most of the services that his own constituents use the most. And if you weren't so stupid you'd see that that only lasts for a few years but the tax cuts to the corporations and the rich people are permanent.
@_date: 2018-07-22 16:57:47
And that amongst many other reason is why you are a traitor to your own country. The main reason Russia is attacking the Democrats and Clinton is because they devastate is economy so bad during the administration.  Look it up
 Putin is former CIA and has been working to destroy our country is entire adult life. Listen to McCain and the other people inside your own broken party that are trying to warn you. The fact you think Putin would be a better leader than Obama was just shows your level of not only ignorance but treason.
@_date: 2018-07-22 17:05:07
FBI is not my idol just because I believe them. This stupid president sold 1 billion dollars of military equipment the Saudi Arabia who has been proven to be responsible at least in part for 9-11. What did you say about guns to Mexico again?

Okay Litecoin from January at around $8 all the way up to $400 at its all-time high is 50x. But at the beginning of 2017 Litecoin had not established itself. Even though it's one of the oldest coins it had been slipping away for quite some time.
For a coin that already has billions in market cap it's a lot harder to 50X

I think you are retarded and living in an alternate reality... whoever told you that taxes are slavery was a complete moron. 
Do you like to drive on roads? do you like to feel safe because of the military? Do you like schools? Do you like firefighters? Do you like the welfare that you're probably on because you're a complete moron? That's all paid with taxes
Taxes actually help everybody to achieve a decent life. How ironic that taxes probably pay for the Wi-Fi you're communicating with me on right now. Public infrastructure is very important to moving forward as a society. I can tell I'm probably speaking to a 14 year old or at least somebody with the life experience of one so I should probably stop wasting my time

Trump is the only one I see causing fights between Americans. He literally calls people Liars he says that his own party members were involved in the JFK assassination, he promotes falsehoods like what is portrayed on Infowars. He has done absolutely nothing to bring Americans together unlike Obama who actually put Republicans in his cabinet. He has made absolutely no deals with anybody in this entire planet since he has been in office when he was supposed to be the grand dealmaker. All he does is cry like a baby and point his fingers at other people while trying to insult them in the most vile way he can think of to try to rile up his ignorant angry base

You don't have to set it up since you owed the Bitcoin private keys. As soon as they make the fork available on the Nano you just download the app and open up the wallet it should work
