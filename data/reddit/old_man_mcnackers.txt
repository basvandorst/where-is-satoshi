That's basically the explanation I gave my dad when he asked me what bitcoin is.

Perfect. Thanks!

I guess its all in the perspective. IF 1 BTC = $10,000 in the near future, $4,000 will look cheap.

When I first got started, I was using Coinbase but the fees are just too high, so I began transferring USD to GDAX and buying there. .25% Fees at GDAX. You have to plan ahead more by keeping some USD on the exchange if you want to buy the dips, but otherwise, its been great.

Nice job. So far I've converted about 5 people (family and friends). Next week, I'm having lunch with 5 people from my wife's office that want to talk to me about Bitcoin and ask questions and have me show them how it works. I'm hoping to have 5 more conversions.

Yeah, my money didn't hit GDAX until the day after. Luckily my wife bought .125 at 3,800 and another .125 at 3,600. I'm buying another .25 next big dip (skeleton.jpg).

I've finally gotten my wife interested. She's even learning how to read a candle chart. Last night me, my wife, and daughter were watching the run up to $4,000 and cheering like it was some kind of sporting event. She said, "We need to buy as much as we can now while it's still cheap."

Newb here, so my apologies if this is a dumb question, but where can I observer the logarithmic graphs?

I started a bitcoin 'savings' account for my kids a month or so ago and my oldest two (12 and 14) have asked that they get their allowance in 75% Bitcoin and 25% USD. My daughter is almost as obsessed with watching the charts as I am. I almost feel guilty about doing that to her.

And a new meme was born. Someone make it happen.

Maybe to save on transaction/exchange fees and agent fees. If he converts £17M into bitcoin, he's going to potentially pay £40,000 or more in exchange fees when he converts. Then if he converts back to fiat, he will pay fees again.
Also, I don't know what the agent fees are in the UK, but here in the US, they're about 5-7%. With the publicity he's getting, he could possibly avoid paying that (although I doubt it on a property of that value).

I knew it was fake as soon as he got in on the wrong side.
