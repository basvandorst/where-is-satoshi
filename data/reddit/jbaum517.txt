You might be right in short term scenarios, but I disagree because I believe Bitcoin is about the technology. It's truly about entities being able to transact in a completely new, trustless way. No matter how anyone feels on any given day, the novelty and utility of the innovation of btc can only grow in the long term. The technology is sound.

The flawed assumption here is that BTC is attempting to be an 100% replica of VISA or Paypal.
The truth is that BTC acts as *more* than just a payment system and there are things that it does better than *all* of the coins you listed like being decentralized and trustless.
If BTC was just intended to be a payment system then it would be worth $0 right now since that's completely different than what the developers originally intended to create.

When you have control over the money supply (something countries can do but no one can for BTC) then they can just pay off debt with printed money and continue to take on more debt while attempting to control the inflation as best as possible as to not completely fuck the country. This requires a lot of trust in the central banking authority (or the Fed in the USA's case).
That being said, if done correctly it is actually very very healthy for a country's economic success and growth to run a deficit as long as they don't over-inflate the currency. 
@_date: 2018-01-09 14:04:46
what's even the concern though? that people are getting a 12.5 BTC reward for not actually funneling through any transactions? Not really a big deal to me.
At least there's no transaction competition in this case. Whenever an empty block is mined it doesn't require an existing miner to re-evaluate the transactions they are trying to hash.

You can request an increased limit and it will likely be granted as long as it's not too ridiculously high.
@_date: 2018-01-08 14:41:41
You have to remember that the whole mining system is based on game theory, not laws and regulations, which means that every now and then things like this can happen. It's probability and statistics based, not regulation based. The theory is that in the long run it's not economically viable or in the best interest of the miners to mine empty blocks. One day when there is no more block reward and only fees, it will be pointless to mine empty blocks. I wouldn't worry about it.
@_date: 2018-01-09 14:32:37
I get that those miners could be spending time hashing blocks with transactions... But, your lack of understanding of the technology is causing you to see problems where there aren't any. it's not a real issue. Have fun with your BCH and chronic delusion...
@_date: 2018-01-13 12:06:11
If coinbase was easy then whyd you need support?
@_date: 2018-01-09 01:10:54
My point is that there is no need. Once there is no more BTC being added from mining new blocks then mining empty blocks will not produce any income and therefore no one will do it.
In the meantime, miners have to decide whether or not it is economically feasible for them to look for empty transaction blocks given the smaller reward and costs of mining.
@_date: 2018-01-02 16:56:49
True decentralization and trustlessness.
I haven't seen these underlying principles be stood by for *any* other alt-coin. BCH and many others? Centralizated. ETH, monero and many many others? Requires a layer of trust.

Hmmmm... no. Open source != Trustless. I'm not even sure what made you think that.
Attempt to run an ETH node and then a full verification of the ETH chain. It's a much more difficult task and not even really possible whereas BTC is completely verifiable.

This comment is filled with so much stupidity.. and yet you call others dumb...


No there is a very small minority of investors that day trade. The vast majority of people that try will and do fail. No one should ever recommend that someone else day trade.


Hodling is equivalent to going long on a traditional investment. You're making a bet that in the long run the price will go up. That's not 2 weeks, 1 month, or even 6 months. It's a bet that if I check back in multiple years the price will have increased and I can make a sell decision at that point. It literally doesn't matter if the price drops for 6 months consecutively as long as after 5 years it has still gone up since the start.
When you sell, rebuy at a lower rate, and it keeps falling is bad gambling behavior. When it keeps falling do you think that retarded, noob day trader is going to hodl? No they are going to sell again and take their losses. Then when it starts going back up they are going to buy in again because they think it's going to rise and then it drops on them again and they sell because they are idiots trying to day trade and they lose again. Then another time it goes up, they buy, it continues going up, they sell because they are predicting the downfall, then it keeps going up, they buy again, then it crashes, then they sell. Oh look, they got fucked again!
You want to lessen your risk? Grow a pair of balls and learn to dollar cost average and hodl

I thought that moving funds to a channel/hub was still an 'on-chain' transaction such that it's 100% known by everyone that there's X amount in that channel/hub. Then whenever that hub settles its ledger it creates another on-chain transaction.
I think that there is still some level of trust when using a layer 2 solution like LN right? Who knows what the lightning node is going to do with those local transactions before they are settled officially on the chain? That's why the code is open source and running on a protocol that all lightening nodes must agree with, so the trust can be reduced.

Diversification means having your investments spread out among different industries and products.
If you have all of your money in crypto, but diversified which coins you are in, then you are still taking a massive gamble on the crypto market as a whole.

I mean yes and no... at *some point* there has to be a transaction that is posted to a node in the decentralized BTC network. In that respect there's only 1 medium to post a transaction.

Asymmetric key cryptography works with a private key and public key combo. When a message is encrypted with the public key, only the associated private key can decrypt it. When a message is encrypted with the private key (this is considered a signature), then it can be verified by decrypting it with the public key. They work as inverse operations of each other in a way.
Transactions on the BTC network are signed by encrypting with the sender's private key. This makes it so only the valid owner of the wallet can send funds and it's verified by nodes in the network decrypting the transaction with the sender's public key. If the private key is stolen, then a bad actor can create transactions and send funds to a different wallet thereby "stealing" the coins. There's no way to get these coins back unless you have the private key associated with the wallet that received coins in said transaction

-A bitcoin can't be hacked. A hacker can hack an exchange and send everyone's coins to their personal wallets. This is no different than a hacker hacking any other website.
-BCH took all of BTC's code (hard fork) and made some controversial modifications without polling the community. Now they spread misinformation and try to trick noobies into thinking that BTC is legacy/old/worthless and BCH is the new bitcoin. It's a scam because in the long run BCH's changes didn't actually fix anything and really just made it less secure and more centralized
-BTC is working on *actual* scalability solutions and improvements instead of just increasing the block size and allowing for emergency difficulty adjustments like BCH did which are not in line with security and decentralization.
-BTC is *truly* trustless and decentralized. That's not to say that other coins don't have value. There are many coins made for very specific purposes and dont' necessarily have the same intent as BTC, but BTC is the real deal when it comes to taking down traditional banks and centralized govt banking authorities because of its adherence to those principles.

Bitcoin is 100% trustless and decentralized which is more than can be said for *any* other alt coin. Any alt-coin that claims the same is either lying or a copy of the BTC protocol that will have no demand since we already have BTC. As other posts in this subreddit have said in the past: "Decentralization, Consensus, and Scale. Pick 2 per protocol layer." BTC picked decentralization and consensus for its base layer. With lightning helping cover scale in its layer, there is no need for alt-coins honestly.

Technically mining is a game. There is a current state (unconfirmed transactions in the mempool), and a limited next move set (using some combination of transactions in the mempool appended together, find the cryptographic nonce that makes the block hash to a specific value).
This "game" could potentially be playable by some futuristic/advanced AI.
Although, at the same time the whole point of cryptographic hashing is that there is no pattern to help you find the answer and it's just raw number crunching and brute forcing.
Maybe some super computer could find patterns though?

Money definitely 100% *cannot* be printed from LN. Ultimately, it's still a layer 2 solution that doesn't affect the underlying BTC protocol. BTC is still limited to 21 million coins and the lightning nodes cannot transact more coins than they have

The next reason that you're wrong and it's clear you're trying to misguide people is because you presume that the only possible usefulness of btc comes from whether or not it has practical daily use.

I think that you are misinterpreting how futures work..
The future is settled against the future price, however, you must buy or sell the future btc at the amount stated in the original contract.
I think what you're trying to describe is a way to hedge your investment in BTC and that's what futures are intended to be used for.
There's no such thing as "risk free" gains. You have no idea the price of BTC is *actually* going to be +$1200 in January.

Show me where in the whitepaper satoshi talks about:
1. Increasing the block size
2. Using a completely centralized network and a cryptocurrency with a board that's run like a business
Hint.. he doesn't. bcash as closer to the whitepaper is just fraudulent/misleading information.
bcash is a scam. It's scary how many people buy into the tx fee propaganda at the cost of all the integrity of a truly decentralized, trustless network that BTC provides.

@_date: 2017-12-21 14:50:48


Wrong. There is no guarantee that fees will stay low. The exact same thing can happen with BCH too, it just allows for double the transactions (difficulty aside) before the same issue happens. That's why *BCH is not a real longterm solution at all.*


Shameless Ver shilling, pointing to bitcoin.com... Arguing that bcash is closer to the original concept laid out by Satoshi is laughable propaganda. [Here is the whitepaper]( Nowhere in it does it talk about blocksize increases which is essentially the technical difference between btc/bch. The biggest issue with BCH is that it's not *decentralized* and there-in lies why it will 100% fail in the long run.
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:01:49
Those alt coins don't have the same scale of BTC which used to also perform like said alt coins when no one was using it.
Other shitcoins, like bcash for example, don't solve the problem and have just increased one factor associated with linear scaling of the network which means the same problems exist just at a higher volume. It's not a real solution. This also came with the cost of centralization which is completely counter to the purpose and nature of btc and which is why bcash is a scam.
I'd like to see a *real* solution to the scaling issue. LN is ok, but I have pretty strong doubts it solves the problem.

I only really, barely knew what to do from the instructions in this reddit post. If I was just given the links and nothing else, I would not understand how to complete a transaction without playing around and failing a few times. 
There is definitely something to be said here in terms of poor usability and/or lingo around this payment system. It doesn't make sense to an average person and I wouldn't even consider myself average as I have a CS degree, work in programming, and understand bitcoin. If a simple payment concept isn't immediately apparent to me then it's not going to work on your average coffee buyer.
Needs improvement.

If youre an everyday person and put in $65k laying around to get 10 btc, then if btc goes and hits 100k, youre at $1M... i dont see that as lambo gains at all.

So the point is that LN will make so that unless you want to pay a higher fee to get your transaction through, you should split the transaction over the other people that share the LN channel?
So.. it's *still possible* to flood the network with high-fee transactions even after LN, it's just not smart economically and the people using LN will be splitting those fees.

The writer did a bad job reporting on the actual contents of the study itself. There are so many questions I have about it including how 'crypto investor' is defined. Are these people with at least 1 crypto buy greater than $0? $10,000? $1M?
Should it be *concerning* that the result of this study is also saying 33% of crypto investors *don't* want to be paid in any amount of bitcoin? That seems pretty high or yet another indicator of the crypto market being pure gambling and speculation rather than understanding of the technology.
Of the 66% who voted one way vs the other, who has the more experienced and knowledgeable base? or most invested already?
What *should* we expect the breakdown to be and is this study showing a difference from that hypothesis that is statistically significant?
The writer should have taken more statistics classes in college to really flesh out that the depth of her mass media and journalism degree. I think it'd help her ask the right questions.

Myspace and facebook aren't at the same level of safety critical systems as the first ever decentralized, trustless monetary network system. Things don't have to be perfect for social media. The developments in this field need to be thought out extremely thoroughly and be much more robust. High fees in the meantime are a small price to pay for the *integrity* of the most robust btc network that we need.
@_date: 2018-09-17 17:09:18
I imagine that the decentralized exchange would be similar to the BTC blockchain network except instead of any one address holding BTC alone, addresses would hold BTC and USD balances side by side. Then you could have address that banks/coinbase/etc own that you could trade your BTC for USD through a transaction on the network, just like a BTC-only network..
That's how *I'd* implement it at least.
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:56:47

This is client software meant to run a node so that for validating the blockchain and hashing.. There is a big difference between the software running a node and bitcoin itself.
As an example.. what if instead of twitter it was called "tweet core" and tweets were still the same thing as they are now? "Tweet core" and "tweets" aren't the same thing. Now, what if someone makes a different site, "Tweet core cash" and they post "tweet cashes" instead of "tweets". They start claiming that their tweets are actually the real tweets and do a massive PR/online media campaign to try to convince people that their tweets are better and the *real* tweet. In all of their arguments they refer to "tweets" as "tweet core" in order to trick people into thinking that "tweets" are actually just "tweet cores". Anything can be the real "tweet" right?

It's not completely unrelated.
I've been in crypto for years and own over 7 different types of crypto. This isn't about tribality.
This is about single coin owners spreading massive hate against one part of btc while completely ignoring the other aspects of it that make it great because they have a monetary incentive to try to help their own coin. Not only that.. they take offense to hearing negatives about the other options.. ^
The /new section of this subreddit has been incessant "tx fees", "tx fees", "tx fees". It's similar to the PR plays in the political subs. The people who've been using btc for a long time know it's a way different feeling.
And yes, we experience the tx fees too and we remember them from when they were practically 0 (and that was just a few short months ago).

It works mostly because the once MSM is writing about it, it's already been doing *some* trend whether that's up or down. It could continue to go in that same trend or it could change. BTC is volatile so the probability of it changing is higher and thus the probability of a coincidence that you're seeing here is much more probably.

There's nothing that different between BTC and a stock when you're just thinking about the price and investing. Both are based on supply and demand calculated through willingness to buy and sell the underlying asset.
You can't just say "stocks aren't random, but bitcoin is"
People's decision making can be reduced to random variables in terms of buying and selling based on whatever information is available, however, just because it can be reduced to randomness doesn't mean there aren't patterns worth analyzing in both.

You're so lost it's hard to take you seriously.
Are you operating under the assumption that lending is only possible with an inflating currency?
Do you honestly think that loans are impossible with BTC?
Do you fail to see how just because BTC is deflationary and borderless doesn't mean that loans are now borderless/anonymous?
I imagine in this hypothetical banks crashing and burning to the fucking ground if they take on more loan risk than they can handle (as they should now but dont). No more govt handouts because inflationary money can just be printed forever.
Would love to hear why you think credit is impossible in a deflationary currency world. It's not.

If anyone's wondering (since this pic is very misleading), 0.268 BTC does *not* equal $1 million.
What this picture is *trying to show* is that the same percentage of the population with more than $1 million is the same as the percentage of people with more than 0.268 BTC in terms of raw quantity of people.
Where things get weird and make this a not very good diagram is that it has a total population of 4.9B, but the world population is 7.6B so that means that 2.7B people aren't being accounted for. Then as a followup question... if this is somehow just looking at 4.9B people with *any* money (USD?) then it really changes the meaning of this because there are MUCH fewer people with BTC, so comparing like this doesn't really make that much sense. There *should* be a 2nd line showing the BTC population number that is different than the non-BTC number.

The current state of crypto is based off of the cryptography that we know and love today that pretty much all of the banks and other institutions use. It all pretty much makes an assumption on computing power and what it would take to do things like factor primes and do other math involving primes. If quantum computing vastly changes how fast algorithms can factor primes and do the techniques used in cracking our current encryption algorithms, then yes, all of the existing coins will be gutted but so will all banks and pretty much everything.
