I have many Chinese friends and they know it happened, they just don't talk about it in China.

That's why I could never understand the whole star wars thing, it was really badly written with plot holes everywhere.
@_date: 2017-08-29 11:51:12
In star wars everyone seemed to have forgotten the Jedi in just 20 years.

Luke was born at the end of the Jedi's power and was only about 20 when he joined the rebels.

We now define stable as sharp peaks with massive drops, if you average it out over a century or two, it's almost a flat line.

I sold my stock options just before the bubble burst and was lucky enough to get my strike price on black Wednesday in 2000 (the tech market dropped 25 to 50% in a day and bounced back over the next couple of weeks, so, not filthy rich but I'm a happy man. 
I also bought bitcoins when they were 100 or 200 for 10 bucks, cost me a few hundred for a bit of a laugh back then.

On a serious note, what is the "real" value of bitcoins?  Many companies are no longer accepting them as payment of real goods and services, Dell dropped them through "lack of interest", nobody spent them.
Most goods like cars have the dealer/wholesaler priced pegged to a certain value and currency, Mercedes will say to all US dealers that this year a car will cost X US dollars at the value on January 1st, this stops price fluctuations throughout the year.
It's hard as a business to accept bitcoins when the value may fluctuate 20% per day or week and go up or down while waiting for them to clear.
They don't have a value tied to a business with cash flow and assets, you can't use them like real estate or gold, they have gone from a currency to an imagined object with no real value other than what people will pay for your imaginary object, basically text book [greater fool theory](
Because of the meteoric rise in value they are useless as currency and are not real in anyway to use other than the buy and sell.
The most telling point is the creator of them is now worth 7 billion, if he/they start selling it can crash the value over night, exactly what bitcoin was supposed to solve, one person or group having massive control of the value.

Your last sentence says it all, We don't know who Satoshis is or anything about him/them other than they currently own around 7 billion in bitcoins, that's a lot of reasons to hype the value.
Bitcoin was intended to be a universal currency used daily to buy and sell goods and services, it was never, ever intended to be an investment vehicle.  Bitcoins themselves have no value other than  what people agree they are worth, businesses that issue shares, bonds that guarantee a return or physical objects like real estate, gold or diamonds have a fairly fixed value and can be held or used for a purpose even cash has a value because it is backed by a country and it's assets.
Bitcoins have none of these things, people are simply following the [Greater Fool theory]( in fact they are the text book example of the theory.  I had great hopes for bitcoin as a currency but it has now turned into an investment vehicle so no one is spending them, companies like Dell are no longer accepting them and the value and fluctuation has made them unsuitable for a currency anyway.  Do you buy a Mercedes today with them or wait a week and get a Ferrari or possibly a Hyundai in 2 weeks?  If a company accepts them they may loose 10 or 20% before they can clear them and sell them, the dealer sells a car for a hundred bitcoins and the manufacturer want either 80 or 120 to replace the stock 2 days later.
The vision of a stable currency with a realistic value was brilliant, it was never intended to be kept as an investment.

I'm 51, been in IT for 30 years and gone through two tech bubbles plus smaller ones, this is exactly what happened at the end of the last tech bubble, learn from history young man.

The problem is junior, you are only listening to fan boys and research that supports your desire, just try looking and listening to other advice and form a balanced opinion or you will go broke early.
@_date: 2017-11-02 10:47:08
See, you keep saying the same thing with no valid argument, when people start screaming "It's all good, you don't know what your talking about"...it's a bubble.
Why do you think the value is escalating so fast with no real increase in spending patterns, people are not spending bitcoins, they are hording them and as people buy them, the price goes up but at some point they need to turn into a currency instead of an investment vehicle or the bottom falls out.
@_date: 2017-11-01 14:39:02
Growing awareness doesn't cause growth on this time scale, it's too fast.  What you need is a slow, steady growth inline with retail acceptance, there has been no major change in vendors of good and services accepting bitcoins in the last month or two but the value of bitcoin has doubled, not good. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 14:37:15
There is a thing called "the fool theory", it's when people buy something only because they expect someone to buy it from them at a higher price.
The rise in value of bitcoin has made them useless as a currency, imagine accepting bitcoins as payment for anything at the moment, buy a car for $40,000 in coins today and next week you could have used the same coin for a $80,000 car...or a $15,000 one depending on the price.
If you accept the coins today, they may be worth 10% less when you sell them tomorrow.  Currency needs to be a fairly linear, predicable thing that retains similar values over months or years.
If coins are useless as currency (Dell and others have stopped accepting them) and they don't have any real value as an investment (there is no bricks and mortar company  or physical thing like gold or diamonds behind them).  What are they exactly, they are not a currency or a share.

this has every sign of a bubble about to burst
@_date: 2017-11-01 20:17:53
I agree but public awareness and growth in measured in years, not months.  This is way to fast an expansion, there is no way major institutions and the public are buying crypto to support this growth, it's fans buying more coins.  There are plenty of [sources]( on this.
@_date: 2017-11-12 14:09:39
This is something new, the values have changed the playing field dramatically, it's called dilution.  When you have an investment worth a hundred dollars and drop 20% it's probably spread over thousands of individual shares or coins you own so you can regain value quickly, when you have only a few shares or coins worth $7000 and drop 20% it impacts confidence and can cause a run, shattering the value.
bitcoins have never dropped in value terms before even if it has lost similar percentages, in the past we have seen drops of a couple of hundred, never $1000 or more per coin.

What is interesting is that I have used real examples of investment vehicles, I have explained the purpose of crypto, I have given examples of why high levels of fluctuation is unsettling and companies that no longer accept bitcoin.
You have done nothing but put your fingers in you ear yelling "I can't hear you"  at no point have you offered of explanation of why you don't think it's a bad thing even though you are arguing with opinions of [every investment experts](
You attitude and arguments are the very definition of bubble mentality. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 20:22:42
look at a 7 year graph of it's value and it looks a lot like a straight line to the top.
@_date: 2017-11-01 14:26:56
No major changes in spending patterns or public acceptance of bitcoin has taken place, the value is running with expectation rather than the market....this is the very definition of a bubble.

As I said elsewhere, 51 years old with 30 years in IT and experience from two major tech bubbles, I may know far more than you think.

You are just so wrong on so many counts, gold, copper, diamonds real estate etc all have value because they can be used, gold goes into electronics and jewelry, diamonds go into industrial and domestic use and paper money is backed by the assets owned by the government, it has a guaranteed value.
Crypto on the other hand has no real value other than what people are willing to pay for it, it is too volatile and valuable to be used a true currency and as it doesn't physically exist in any form it has not value as an investment vehicle (it was never designed to be an investment vehicle).
I think the biggest problem is the relatively low amount available, there is simply never going to be enough of them to be a serious currency, who wants to pay 0.0001 coin for anything  it's like having a paper currency with the lowest denomination of $1000.00

This sub is full of fan boys hoping to hype the value of bitcoin and make the value rise, the problem is when this happens in the share market people eventually realize they have over valued the share and sell it off causing a crash.  The problem is shares are linked to real world business that have a real value, bitcoins have turned into investment vehicle that don't actually have any real value other than a price not attached to anything substantial.
As not many people are actually spending bitcoins companies like Dell have stopped accepting them as payment.  At some point people will understand they are buying and selling something that has no real value unless they start actually using them to buy things and turn them back into a currency.
@_date: 2017-11-12 13:58:26
Still think I have no idea about crypto, down a $1000.00 in a few days...
@_date: 2017-11-12 14:41:50
that's why a lot of companies will not accept it as payment anymore  imagine selling a hundred thousand dollar car last week and finding you just gave the customer a 20% discount before it cleared.
