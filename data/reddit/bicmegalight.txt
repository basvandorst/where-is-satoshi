How long does it take for transactions to confirm?I haven't even got 1 confirmation.
I sent my bitcoin to to the correct address. 
I paid an appropriate fee. 
Ive been waiting like 10hours and tbh Im getting a bit worried. 
What can I do? I know I can't reverse transactions, but what happens if it doesn't get picked up by a miner? How do I get it out of limbo?

The main problem with bitcoin is sponsorship. Any and all powerful countries will have a strong currency, and only one currency per country. A currency's strength is reflective of it's country's political power. At this time, the USA is very powerful, and has the healthiest economy of any western country, which is why the US Dollar has been strengthening recently. As a result, the market has spoken, and has voted FOR the US Dollar and AGAINST bitcoin. Translation: There is no room , and no need, for a domestic "competing currency", especially as US Dollars can be transmitted electronically. Bitcoin offers no advantage to the US Dollar, ad therefore it loses to it. History tells us that bitcoin is destined to become worthless.

One of the main problems with Bitcoin is that there is a lot of complicated terms that are difficult for the average person to understand. Once people have a better knowledge of it they will be more likely to become advocates and spread the word. 
This I think is vital to any Bitcoin Marketing Campaign. So about 6 months ago when I and a friend had a bit of free time we created Bitcoin Bites. The idea being to simplify difficult terms in bitcoin, into short concise vids. You can check them out [here]( They didn't get any traction &amp; tbh I was quite busy &amp; just didn't have the time. Im on the fence about creating more. What do you guys think?
