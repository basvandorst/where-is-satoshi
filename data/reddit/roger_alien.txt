Also, the car in the photo appears to be or have once been a taxi, which uses a driver who is paid a fee to drive to a particular location.

Because asking for a word definition on a comment forum is way quicker than Google or dictionary.com.

The symbology in the photo is definitely ripe for interpretation. A Fiat car crashing into an monetary establishment that poses a threat to the fiat monetary system. The black and white tiled symbol that is universally associated with freemasonry, which has its roots in the Knights Templar, who were known to exploit monetary systems until they were ordered to be killed by the Catholic church that historically used the belief in God to maintain an empire and its associated monetary riches. 
The license plate is LAA-4785. Laa is the transliteration of the arabic word for "no", and takes the imperative form, used as a negation when preceding a statement. In this case, it would translate to "don't".  4785 corresponds to the English alphabet letters EHGD. In Arabic, which is a semitic language similar to Hebrew, "eh" is a colloquial term signifying agreement. GD is commonly used as a representative term for "God" by devout Jews, who believe that it is disrespectful to even spell out the word God or his formal name. 
So the meaning of the license plate is "Don't agree God". So it is possible that this was an act of God, whose ardent followers derive their livelihood from the fiat currency system. So either God has a problem with bitcoin, which provides an alternative and hence opposition to the holy fiat system, or the followers of God are making a statement on his behalf.
