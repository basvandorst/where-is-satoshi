Thank you. I completed the dump and am doing the console rescanblockchain which is indeed taking hours. I will look into electrum in the meantime, but no rush so I may just wait it out overnight. CHEERS!

It's not a virus. Notice how they were sent at the exact same time from the same tx? Well a hacker couldn't make them send in the same tx, with my friend as a recipient in real time could he?  This is how change addresses work.

Bitcoin core says "HD key generation is enabled", and I ran the application with -rescan but it didn't find any new addresses. Here's a screenshot of my Transactions

I try man, I try. Gonna adapt to this event and make it stronger. Peace!

Thank you, I will run that command and lookup wiki for it as soon as my client finishes rescan.

Opsec aside, because it's just anecdotal at best. Let's just argue the technical information on the transaction. Why does the change address return "isscript: true" in getaddressinfo? 
I argue it's true because it was generated as a change address. I argue a hacker's receiving address would return false even if malware rerouted my transaction destination in real time.

Affordable never looked so good!

I did a rescan before posting. The backup does not keys to the change address generated after the backup. What do you mean by "it's not a backup"?

BRO it's not malware. [Look at the bitcoin wiki!]( [Look at the sample transaction!]( Compare it to mine!
