It would also reduce variance in time to first confirmation.
The thing that annoys me most about Bitcoin is waiting 45 minutes for a first confirmation.

It's not really a "war" though. It's just progress.
Edit: In light of downvotes, I'll explain. Physical cash is an anachronism. Getting rid of it is highly desirable. There is no "war". There's war in Syria, but there is no "war" on cash. Rather, there is just the trend for people to prefer not using it. All around the world cash is being used less and less. The only benefit cash still offers over digital money is that it's anonymous. But Bitcoin solves that problem. Bitcoin can be as transparent or anonymous as you like. So I think physical cash will continue to disappear, whether by regulation or simply by consumer preferences. And digital fiat money and Bitcoin will continue to see increased adoption. And that's progress. I wasn't implying that banning anonymous currency is a good thing.

If you hold government-issued currency for any significant period of time the government/banks are robbing you as they make those holdings less valuable over time. Doesn't matter if you have the money in a bank or in cash, it still gets less valuable. Only way around it is to spend that money as soon as you earn it, which is of course exactly what they want you to do... so they can rob you further with taxes.

If they make a decentralised currency, then they can't control it, so there'd be no point them making it in the first place, might just as well use Bitcoin instead.

In debt to our descendants for the natural resources that Earth provides.
Things are cheap now because we live beyond our means. We take out of the environment faster than it is replenished. We burn all the oil, destroy all the forests, pollute all the seas, and eat all the fish.
Money is just a way of measuring how much value things have. Fresh fish are something of value. But the oceans are nearly out of bluefin tuna. Global debt is a result of unsustainable consumption.

Unless all the miners switch off leaving the difficulty sky high without enough hash power to reach the next difficulty change. Blocks would no longer be solved, or they'd take days each instead of the usual 10 minutes. This happened with Terracoin in 2013.

I was very drunk at the time, so my memory is hazy, sorry. I do clearly remember thinking, however, that this wasn't as easy as it should be.
Maybe do some user testing with complete noobs and see where the sticking points are. Maybe you've done this, but there are various services online where you can crowd source testing very cheaply. You offer $x for, say, five different people to spend 10 minutes with your app and to video the process and send it to you for review.
Drop the need for a PIN. At least for empty wallets. He couldn't remember his PIN and for dealing with a test amount of 50 cents it seemed overkill. After all, Bitcoin is supposed to be digital cash, and there's no PIN on physical cash wallets. Maybe this is already a setting, I don't have an iPhone to check though.
The use of bits rather than whole bitcoins threw me. I know there was a campaign 18 months ago to switch to bits, but that was when Bitcoin was &gt;$1000 and everyone thought it would imminently rise further. It almost made sense at the time. I know this is a whole other debate, but I'm just reporting how we felt using it.

That is not true at all.
Greeks have been able to access their bank accounts just fine. They can make transfers to pay their rent, use their debit cards to go shopping, make business transfers.
The only restrictions have been on INTERNATIONAL transfers, and on withdrawing cash. Most ordinary people don't need international transfers. Agreed the cash withdrawal is a bit of a problem. But still, the assertion in that article is flat out wrong.

Interesting that the "attack" is not completely crippling. I mean, the mempool is being kept at ~50k to 100k tx. If it were a genuine attack, by someone with serious funds and malicious intent, then why not a million transactions, or even a billion? Paying $1m in transaction fees would be a drop in the ocean to a big bank if they thought it would destroy Bitcoin or at least set it back a decade. This suggests that it's by someone who doesn't actually want to destroy Bitcoin.
An alternative conspiracy theory is that the stress test, or attack, or whatever, is actually being done by a bank, or even a government. They are testing the system before deciding whether to invest.

Maybe you've never used Bitcoin before. Because I can assure you, scanning a QR code and clicking send is much easier, and feels less intrusive on your privacy.

BTCGreece allows purchases of up to €250 of Bitcoin per day.

Actually, he was incredibly protective of his coins. He only ever spent, I think 20 BTC, which he gave to Hal Finney, and that was it. He may have spent more in secret, but never publicly. And none of the coins thought to have been mined by him have ever moved. Plus, he often made comments in the Bitcoin forum about how losing keys is "careless" and "a shame". I think he's sitting on them, undecided what to do, waiting for the right time when they can be safely spent and put to humanitarian use. That time may never come, which is OK too.

They're not banned, exactly. It's just that to run one you need a banking license. To get a banking license costs upwards of €100,000 and so far no Bitcoin enthusiasts have been able to put up the funds and time required to go through the process. A few people have made attempts. There were experimental ATMs in Munich and, I think, Bochum. But they only had permission to run a short-term limited trial, around three months, maximum of €100 per day.
One of the existing banks could decide to use their existing license to open an ATM, but so far none of them are interested. The only bank in Germany which is interested in cryptocurrency is Fidor, who are based in Munich. But they're an online only bank. They don't have any physical branches, and are not currently interested in physical ATMs either.

Machines will eventually become as intelligent and self-aware as humans. And once that happens, they'll very quickly be able to make themselves more intelligent and more capable in every way. It's inevitable.

Only question is, which comes first, economic collapse or sentient machines. The machines are 15+ years away.

I tried to figure out who they are. Clicked the "About us" link and found myself looking at the "about us" page for Instagram.  Umm, no thank you, not going to be sending money through them.

Bitcoin Wallet for Android makes users jump through the fewest hoops. Install the app and off you go. The others require PIN numbers and all that crap.

It took Hotmail to make email accessible to most people. We think of Hotmail as being around since forever, but it actually only first came along a few years after I'd been using email. And even then it took another couple of years to get really popular. I think Bitcoin has yet to have its Hotmail moment.

By 2050 there will be far bigger changes then merely the currency in use. By then self-aware robots will have taken over. It's arguable whether humanity will even exist in its current form, let alone our financial system.

That's no secret, is it? Governments are quite open about how "hoarding" cash is supposedly bad for the economy. Yes, they want everyone to either spend their money or invest it.

More laws. Just what we need.

And what have you done?
@_date: 2015-10-27 13:19:35
Nuclear fusion would be very disruptive, for sure, but society would still need a way to store wealth and to measure value.
Government-issued money is not very future proof, so Bitcoin is still the best option we have.
@_date: 2015-02-16 20:54:50
Go on then. You build it. Or are you hoping someone else will do the work?

Any business, and particularly money services businesses, should inspire trust by being open about who they are, where they are, and what their personal background are. Any website that is shy about admitting who runs that website is immediately suspected of having something to hide.

TL/DR Willy and Markus were robots, probably controlled by someone inside MtGox, which bought lots of Bitcoin late 2013 and pumped the price. They then reversed and sold lots to crash the price in early 2014. Article describes the pattern of buying and selling in great detail, but exactly who controlled the bots and what their purpose was is still not known.

You need to find someone local with whom there is trust. Like a friend of a friend. If you live in a big city maybe there is a Bitcoin meetup group. You can post to the group and ask if anyone is interested. Search on Facebook for "Bitcoin near  entering your city. Key thing is to find a Bitcoiner nearby. You should at least put your city in your post at the top of this thread, preferably in the title (although it's too late to edit that now).
