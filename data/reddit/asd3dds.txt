You are dumb and look like a fat turd. It must suck to be you.

I never thought Andreas could get any dumber... But he keeps proving me wrong at every opportunity!

$10 meal - they either refund the customer 25%, or pay the CC provider 3%. They choose option one. They are idiots... so they might be bitcoiners already!

No no, the major impediment to adoption is the fact that Bitcoin is useless for the common Joe, because the common Joe has no interest in becoming the greater fool in your pyramid of idiocy, no matter how much you try to pump it. So you bitcoiners can keep trading virtual tokens among yourselves until the price finally gets flushed down the toilet, and you all have to move on to the next get-poor-quick scheme.

That's great, but what are Kim Kardashian's thoughts on this issue?
PS. Bitcoiners are a bunch of retards.

The problem those clueless geeks will face is trying to make Bitcoin useful. But that's impossible, because every person with half a brain knows it's a crappy and inefficient technology. Sorry for ruining your pump attempt! You can always get a job, you know?
