Totally see your point brother. Yes freezing people's money when they wish it's gonna lead to them getting fucked by authorities like the guy in the upper comment said. I understand they overloaded. I get it. But hey BTC been on the news every single day the last year. They had time, they know they playing with people's money. That's anyone's (or almost) tender spot

I WILL NEVER EVER SELL MY BITCOIN EVEN IF IT GOES TO 1€!!! And you know why??? �� because of what BITCOIN MEANS! Not speculation. Take the speculation away and what you have left? Some people say nothing it has no value bla bla. NO! IT DOES HAVE VALUE it's a revolution and  IM NEVER SELLING ITTTTT -HAVING ONE MEANS BEING PART OF THE REVOLUTION AND THATS THE ONLY THING THAT MATTERS! EVEN IF IT GOES TO 1€ it's still worth 50K to me. And to many others. RISEEEEEEEE &amp;
