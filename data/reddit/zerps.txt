Interesting idea!
As an aside, I wonder how a billing process could work involving a very cheap fee per session (way below normal costs) and then an additional donation wallet for patients/clients who have great recoveries and wish to support the service. 
I'm sure if the therapy helps a lot of clients would have no problem donating if their fee was much lower than traditional means.
Therapist feedback would also be another great thing to ease client's minds. There are many quack therapists out there who I'm sure can do more harm than good, a piece of paper from a university does not make you instantly able to socialize in such a sensitive way. Feedback would be anon and categorized by issue, as I'm sure some areas will be prone to bad feedback solely just due to their clients conditions. It would be an even stronger indicator of a good therapist if they have good feedback in those areas.
Having a feedback system with the low fee + donation system I think would be an encouraging way for both clients to have trust in their therapist and for their therapist to do the best they can.
You could also get around malpractice and regulations with good disclaimers, terms of conditions, and even the wording of the service.
