Craig was factually correct in amongst the swearing, the "professor" was a douche and Gavin's own remarks about Satoshi having a prickly personality.. all seems to fit.

Absolutely, if you want freedom, you need to exercise some personal responsibility to avoid doing something silly like installing dodgy software.
If you don't want to do that, because it is a little harder and time consuming then stay in the safe/cosy App store world and live by their rules.
I've run a jailbroken iphone with blockchain and other apps with bitcoins stored for years.. never had a problem.

Obvious pump and dump.. funny how its market cap seems to rally to just beat NXT by just a few hundred dollars then stop.  Hopefully they will blow all the pre-mine eventually and it goes away.

Evad3rs have a wonderful tool called a Jailbreak.. it allows you to install &amp; run any app, even opensource apps you compile and install yourself.
Even Google block some apps from their app store.. in which case you compile yourself and install manually. Same deal with Apple.

So don't install any untrustworthy Jailbroken apps..

If you don't have a developer license you'll have to change the keychain set and get calls to something else.
Check the issues on GitHub.
The dev has some ideas on how to fix this.

I'm looking forward to the day when I can use this to log into all my favourite websites using a Trezor.. Goodbye massive list of passwords!
