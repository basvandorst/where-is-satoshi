I have a similar problem, but my max amount to receive says 0
@_date: 2017-12-18 20:01:16
So what will come first, block  or $1,000,000/bitcoin? ��
@_date: 2017-12-18 20:23:05
Yep, me too 
@_date: 2017-02-14 09:16:03
10% bitcoin  
10% cash  
20% bonds  
60% index funds
@_date: 2017-02-13 05:36:46
So not considered safe then :P

Stop thinking in dollars and start to look at % and suddenly it's not so bad anymore ☺️
@_date: 2017-02-12 14:07:12
That was fast, thanks :)  
So I can have they same wallet on multiple devices if I want, didn't now that 
@_date: 2017-02-13 05:35:40
Good point 
@_date: 2017-02-12 14:15:05
Thanks, might look into a hardware wallet in the future

I bought 2 btc in January.  
After listening to The Internet of Money I realized that this is going to be huge so I started to screenshot everytime the price went up 1000 SEK.  
Going to by fun to have in 5 years ��
@_date: 2017-11-12 14:52:20
Nope, just send it to a segwit address :)

Watching that video now, it's really good, big thanks for that one ��
@_date: 2019-12-21 18:11:11
Aha, thanks 
No, all funds is on my side.
How do I balance channels?
@_date: 2019-12-30 22:13:13
Yes! Figured it out yesterday ��
Go to settings in MyNode and then Linux Terminal, paste the command there
@_date: 2019-12-21 18:07:56
Of course
@_date: 2019-12-21 20:29:47
Thanks, will take a look ��
@_date: 2019-12-30 22:20:16
Hmm, I think it started after a couple of minutes for me.
Maybe ask in the Telegram group
@_date: 2019-12-21 20:40:07
That's a really unhelpful answer..
I have followed the guide for Tor setup.
But there are no guides on how to connect to the gui or zap remotely through Tor
@_date: 2019-12-21 21:24:34
Wtf is your problem?

We can't be sure it will be approved, but if it is ����
