Bitcoin is about different things to different people. It is about getting rich to some. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 10:09:36
Posting you don’t care screams indifference. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:53:23
Wow. That’s quite a stretch.
@_date: 2017-12-26 17:56:21
Count me in please 
@_date: 2017-12-27 22:28:48
What affects the price is whatever the last price a bitcoin was bought/sold for. If the last coin was bought at slightly above market rate the price goes up, if it was bought at s slightly below rate the price goes down. The only thing that directly affects the price is whatever the last price a coin was sold at. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 16:59:57
How come the forked etherium is now called Etherium, and the original is Etherium classic. Why don’t the same rules apply to bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-09-04 12:52:13
@_date: 2017-12-16 09:19:02
Those people are wrong. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 21:06:32
who's in charge of bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-19 03:14:38
It’s actually the opposite for me. Now that accept Bitcoin Cash I will use my bitpay card again. I can’t spend $20+ everytime i load my goddamn card. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:32:19
yeah it goes up and down. that's what happens now. we haven't seen sideways movement in months. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 10:11:39
I know 
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:40:46
It's both, but it's not the end of bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-09-12 23:06:25
Allegedly 
@_date: 2017-12-30 22:31:28
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:51:05
I don’t understand. Who are the people that want bitcoin to be a store of value and internet gold?
@_date: 2017-12-04 22:59:09
So what exactly do you want people to do? Only talk about the points you want to talk about? 
@_date: 2017-12-01 12:16:44
O YEAH!!!!!!
Maybe by “made” he meant “added a shitty watermark.”
@_date: 2017-12-16 16:44:05
IMO that is not what is happening. 
@_date: 2018-09-13 07:29:08
You were there? Or are you a Belizian prostitute?
@_date: 2017-12-18 05:54:01
who cares?
@_date: 2017-12-16 06:17:04
i would like him to give me 1 billion dollars and cure cancer, and also revive my deceased mother. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:44:52
I am 14 years old and I find this to be edgy. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 11:14:41
Those two situations are not comparable. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:52:13
Twins said it will be trillions. 
@_date: 2018-09-12 23:07:27
This is bitcoin

Tell him no
@_date: 2018-09-13 09:30:59
@_date: 2017-12-16 10:08:28
Why do you care?
@_date: 2018-09-11 05:08:24
Anonymous advice. Don’t give financial advice to friends, family, or people you work with. You risk ruining your relationship and there is very little upside. Understand?
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:56:32
Wow. This sub totally sucks. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 08:49:40
Why is the forked etherium called etherium and the original etherium called etherium classic and why doesn’t anyone bitch about that? 
@_date: 2017-12-18 04:18:39
What the fuck are you talking about?
@_date: 2018-09-12 23:20:08
If a Belizian prostitute said it, it must be true right?
@_date: 2018-09-12 23:33:45
Yeah right. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 11:09:21
Just shut up
@_date: 2017-12-28 12:40:39
Like he didn’t try that. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 00:53:01
As soon as you prove they committed fraud in a court of law then I will agree they committed fraud. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 23:29:11
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:50:32
we'll see
@_date: 2017-12-30 11:06:03
We beat them
@_date: 2018-09-12 23:11:47
Unsubscribed 
@_date: 2017-12-16 16:55:46
Ok. Looks like you know everything, good for you. 
How come when etherium forked we call the forked coin etherium and the original coin Etherium Classic?
@_date: 2017-12-24 17:33:38
Because people are dumb and easily excitable. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:53:55
So you are agreeing with him. 
@_date: 2018-09-16 01:24:35
John McAfee hasn’t done anything to me but provide entertainment via the one documentary and the silly shit he does in the news. If three Belizian prostitutes said they shit in his mouth that is hardly proof of anything. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 03:04:21
I do.
@_date: 2017-12-16 06:15:13
Your wife sucks other dudes dicks?
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:35:05
@_date: 2018-09-13 09:24:08
You were there?
@_date: 2018-09-10 22:10:52
This is why you don’t give financial advice. 
@_date: 2018-08-03 19:50:27
Yeah well I didn’t go to stock college I’m
Sorry. 
@_date: 2018-08-28 05:45:55
That has nothing to do with this. 
@_date: 2018-08-01 20:22:19
Is this true?
@_date: 2018-08-03 19:50:49
That is what I’m going with from now on. 
@_date: 2018-05-23 13:42:22
Shut up about it
@_date: 2018-08-02 19:54:14

@_date: 2018-06-10 19:43:23
@_date: 2018-06-18 21:17:45
I understand what you mean. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 21:15:53
right on.l
@_date: 2018-06-11 00:48:19
Me too 
@_date: 2018-06-25 17:44:10
I also care about money. I use it to eat, which is imperative to my survival. 
@_date: 2018-06-18 21:09:28
Yeah, that would explain it.  There was a guy who lost his laptop and was offering congratulations and $2000 for its return. I thought it was a Stockholm syndrome thing but it isn’t. 
@_date: 2018-06-16 22:35:54
I know 
@_date: 2018-06-24 15:22:09
A lawyer would be able to answer your questions as to how to serve them. That’s why you need a lawyer. A lawyer will also be able to tell you how to submit information from the blockchain as evidence. You can’t just print it out and go to court and say “see look at this!!” That’s is you even make it to a trial, which will be years from now. 
@_date: 2018-06-19 15:20:49
I get why he is offering the money. I don’t get why he was congratulating the the thief  like in this post. 
@_date: 2018-06-16 22:35:17
Interesting 
@_date: 2018-06-16 14:30:07
How is it safer?

Damn. I’ve never seen someone with their head so far up their own ass. 
@_date: 2018-06-18 20:22:12
Why do people give props to people that scam them? 
@_date: 2018-06-13 07:33:47
No it’s not

Don’t you ever tell me how to live my life 
@_date: 2017-11-12 20:07:50
Does this mean anything yet?

If you live in the US why use an international exchange?
@_date: 2017-11-14 17:00:44
this sub is becoming useless. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 16:51:31
so what? He's still rich. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 01:56:12
your buddy is an idiot. who cares what he thinks. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 16:27:11
Who cares?
@_date: 2017-11-17 14:43:36
I've seen 3 teslas in this sub in the last day. I haven't seen any Lambos. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 14:57:53
Why would you use the silk road for pot? You can get weed very easily from me or anywhere really. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 15:07:26
Yeah i understand. But since seattle is legal now you can just do it without using silk road right? Don't the dispensaries there deliver?
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:33:37
I’ll do it for 90
@_date: 2017-11-02 07:04:28
I bought $300 worth this morning and made $30 bucks. I am i doing something wrong??
@_date: 2017-11-13 01:34:24
I did not read the letter. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 14:47:21
Grand theft is $750 or more. What op is doing is called “fraud.”
@_date: 2017-11-02 07:24:27
why don't you just sell it for money and then buy bitcoin. Are you talking about like a plastic tarp?
@_date: 2017-11-08 15:02:04
I will deliver to anywhere in the us via usps. Being doing it for years without a single hiccup. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 16:50:06
Straw man 
@_date: 2017-11-02 07:26:59
So were talking like $10??? Just sell it on craigslist. Whatever concerns you have regarding craigslist are only going to be magnified by using bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 15:49:46
Isn’t he a billionaire? I don’t think he’s pissed. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 15:23:01
that makes sense. I forget that there are still some places that it's hard to get high grade chronic. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 15:13:44
yes of course. my bad, i misunderstood you. We are agreeing :)
@_date: 2017-11-07 20:29:17
I keep reading this story. Since he’s a Saudi royal this is all just for show right? Nothings actually going to happen to him. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 16:10:34
cool, you're sexist too. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 00:58:17
It's just completely irrelevant. I don't know anything about the personal lives of the bitcoin core people and I don't care to. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 16:20:44
Are you referring to America or this sub?
@_date: 2017-11-02 19:19:34
Yeah well I want those damn pennies!
@_date: 2017-11-02 09:01:26


could you please explain this part. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 02:40:34
It’s jeff Bezos. Owner of amazon. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:44:16
He wrote an entire article on why what he is doing is the right move. I highly doubt he understood the error of his ways. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 17:22:44
That user is an idiot and doesn't deserve help. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 02:42:19
They won’t. Is a conspiracy theorist thing. It’s all speculation. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 14:48:17
It’s also my understanding that “the moon” is $10,000. 
@_date: 2018-03-05 07:25:16
Nah, would be much cheaper/easier to have her killed. She’s just lying, like prostitutes are known to do. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 13:10:16
Easier if you just leave. 
@_date: 2017-09-30 17:31:32
Is having my coins on exodus better than coinbase?
@_date: 2017-10-21 07:25:25
Does Goldman Sachs even have $200 billion?
@_date: 2017-10-08 06:29:37
Okay. 
@_date: 2017-10-31 13:42:41
Thank you 
@_date: 2017-10-20 16:51:14
I'm not bitter. I take great joy in denying you what you want. I don't have a soul.
@_date: 2017-10-02 16:24:32
At or near all time high is very rarely the right time to get in. 
@_date: 2017-10-08 07:45:27
Yeah and as soon as this guy hits 30 years of age maybe he'll have enough experience to listen to. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 11:18:18
Nobody is wronging him. He made the mistake himself 
@_date: 2017-09-29 05:05:29
I own an extremely valuable bridge I'd like to sell him. 
@_date: 2017-10-21 15:34:00
Tell me how rocks need maintenance. 
@_date: 2017-10-31 13:17:08

I didn’t realize Irish people were so concerned with US taxes. 
@_date: 2017-10-21 08:16:52
Do not kill yourself over $2000. Just tell your parents, it's an accident and it doesn't sound like you did anything wrong. If my daughter was in trouble over $2000 I'd give it to her no questions asked. 
@_date: 2017-10-21 18:49:25
Nobody. Including you can understand the concept of infinite. 
@_date: 2017-10-21 18:59:20
You don't understand infinity. You can use it as a symbol but you cannot fully understand what infinity means. Nobody can. This rock will last forever. Every time I look at it I will be reminded of you being wrong. 
@_date: 2017-10-31 11:58:25
Damn you are thick 
@_date: 2017-10-16 17:29:59

@_date: 2017-10-31 11:24:21
Can’t see something that doesn’t exist. 
@_date: 2017-10-12 11:36:06
No. It can take up to four days to receive your btc on coinbase. 
@_date: 2017-10-19 19:11:54
I did the same thing except I used exodus. Am I also cool? The "private key" everyone talks about is the 12 word password code thing right?
@_date: 2017-10-27 19:36:12
IT was your own fucking analogy. Just shut up.
@_date: 2017-10-21 18:47:27
The amount of time it would take to do that makes the original analogy that we are arguing over pointless. 
@_date: 2017-10-29 07:08:49
Buy cryptos and hold them. 
@_date: 2017-10-18 21:08:15
Why you gotta be a dick about it?
@_date: 2017-10-27 19:35:46
We are not going to agree here. be well. 
@_date: 2017-10-03 03:10:33
Why do you want to change her mind? Just buy coin, once she figures out what she missed you will have made money. 
@_date: 2018-07-08 10:31:01
The state. Trying to keep bitcoin down. Fuck theirs 
@_date: 2017-10-23 16:33:31
I thought it was oct 25 with a nov 1 reveal. 
@_date: 2017-10-21 19:18:57
Thousands of scientist would agree that this rock will last forever without maintenance when compared to the blockchain and the maintenance it requires. The rock is still here. When it erodes away I will message you to tell you are right, but until then I win. 
@_date: 2017-10-21 08:44:09
John Lennon was not in limo when he was shot. 
@_date: 2017-10-21 18:40:47
Erosion is not going to affect this rock sitting on the table. It will far outlast the block chain with 0 maintenance. No dots needing connection. 
@_date: 2017-10-31 18:04:30
Yeah yeah yeah. Good cop out. 
@_date: 2017-10-21 18:53:35
Again, trying to insult me doesn't make your right. For all intents and purposes this rock will last forever and will be a symbol of me being right and you being wrong. Erosion will not affect it. 
@_date: 2018-07-08 11:02:03
I’m willing to bet crypto this place doesn’t accept crypto 
@_date: 2017-10-27 17:25:12

@_date: 2017-10-19 00:06:14
If you don't like it, leave. 
@_date: 2017-10-11 20:26:54
You'd rather they just take around ~35% and give you nothing? 
@_date: 2017-10-16 03:19:49
That will not be happening 
@_date: 2017-10-31 11:19:56
Religion is bullshit and a lie. 
@_date: 2017-10-30 16:50:39
I think a more simplistic answer is; whatever the last person paid for a bitcoin is what affects the market price of bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 11:19:19
The second sentence is a lie to yourself. 
@_date: 2018-07-17 09:36:54
No I don’t 
@_date: 2018-07-08 02:26:25
Fuck theirs?
@_date: 2017-10-21 18:29:58
I'm familiar with what erosion is. That has nothing to do with maintenance on a rock. Trying to insult me doesn't make you right. 
@_date: 2017-10-31 11:59:06
What do you mean? You can see every bitcoin ever made. 
@_date: 2017-10-31 12:28:44
It’s a bad joke. 
@_date: 2017-10-29 06:42:30
@_date: 2017-10-21 08:46:43
Rocks 
@_date: 2017-10-14 16:18:46
You can, but they will still audit you. 
@_date: 2017-10-29 09:36:15
Cool but when?!?
@_date: 2017-10-20 16:09:47
No you may not 
@_date: 2018-07-28 14:05:18
There’s no internet police?
@_date: 2017-10-31 14:59:20
There is definitely a virtual bitcoin that you can see on the blockchain. There is no tangible asset but that’s not what we were talking about which is why your joke doesn’t make sense. I personally think bitcoin has no tangible asset and it has not intrinsic value but that is a minority belief in this sub. 
@_date: 2017-10-03 03:08:42
At or near it's all time high is very rarely the right time to buy. 
@_date: 2017-10-21 06:54:53

Berkeleylaw calling out liberals. Nice. 
@_date: 2017-10-31 13:24:22
So should I take my btc out of my bitpay wallet? Is the exodus wallet okay to use?
@_date: 2018-04-24 08:57:57
Like sexually?
