Best I recall, Revolut, like Robinhood, doesn’t let you withdraw your coins, it’s just a promise to grant you “exposure” to bitcoin riding on their reputation.  5% may not be the best rate, but if you’re just starting with smaller amounts, maybe OK.

First off, understand your wallet.  Your wallet generates a public address at which bitcoins can be sent.  More importantly, you'll have a private key.  The private key allows you (or anyone that gets a hold of it), to initiate outbound payments from your wallet.
When you receive bitcoin, a validated transaction is recorded in the public ledger (aka bitcoin blockchain) that credits a certain amount of bitcoin to your public address.  You, and everyone else, can consult the current balance, as well as all historical transactions in/out of your public address.
If you have kept control of your private key, only you can authorize spending bitcoins credited to your public address.
When you buy bitcoin at an exchange, you'll see a balance credited to your exchange account.  You don't own that balance...the exchange is just showing a balance you may be entitled to withdraw...a promise subject to withdrawal limits, bankruptcy, and hacking.  When you withdraw that balance to a wallet address where you control the private key, that's when you actually own bitcoin.

I'm not sure if being a holder of airdropped BCH makes me a "user", but I agree with your sentiment.
At the 1st release of any minor improvement on BTC transaction capacity...in any "layer"...BCH's status is prone to undergo an ugly reset, likely joining LTC, Dash, etc, etc, etc.
And even though I don't own LTC, I wouldn't rule out LTC growing its adoption as a small-transaction-favored coin ahead of BCH and many other wanna-be-currency coins.

It sure does in the topic of asset valuation.    
Hot hand relates to the probability of independent random events happening sequentially...like die rolls and coin flips.
But the price at which a specific liquid asset is purchased is highly correlated through time.     
If someone decided once to buy BTC at 15K recently, it sure does make it more likely others will buy at that price later.

I’m quite ambivalent about your worries, and the whole spend &amp; replace thing, I find quite pointless if you’re forcing yourself to do it, or have a small position.
I think the best strategy is to accumulate via periodic buys and spend when it’s convenient.
Adoption is going perhaps slower than many hope, but that’s no reason to do anything that goes against anyone’s economic interest.
If you want to help adoption, why not learn a bit about setting up a Lightning node...stake a safe portion of that HODL stash...spend some if it makes sense!
Once you have a a large-enough position, spending becomes much more natural, and I bet there will be more options to pick from.
@_date: 2018-05-29 17:42:20
Depends on how you frame it.
Cash is less portable and less secure than crypto, so some value this as greater freedom to travel with your assets with less risk of loss or confiscation.
Others see freedom in the ability to conduct global transactions without 3rd-party intervention or censorship.
If you frame it for local spending, with crypto still very low adoption in retail, you wouldn't feel freer compared to cash in local currency.

Not for the purpose of getting returns.
Crypto in general is hardly “safe” as an investment and coins allowing staking much less so.    
To get a meager return, you need to place a large position at risk, and the downside risk will always be orders of magnitude greater than what the staking returns could ever offset.
That being said, if you *have* to hodl a particular coin, then by all means, stake.

This may be so, but this case makes no sense as stated.
I’d thought you requested withdrawal for the amount you got, and what you think is missing should still be in ur coinbase acct.
Coinbase would not direct funds to an address you didn’t provide to them and to my knowledge, they support a single address per withdrawal request, so the best interpretation is that the bech32 address is coinbase change address, where these coins are just returning back to coinbase.

That’s the aggregate amount of coins committed to public channels.

@_date: 2019-03-16 19:53:48
When a node opens a payment channel with another node, a certain amount of coins is committed into the channel.  While the channel is open, the share of ownership of the commited coins can be re-assigned by the channel nodes, but the coins remain committed in the channel until the channel is closed.  Upon closure, a transaction is posted to the main bitcoin chain to each of the nodes according to the last agreed-upon share.

Given your scenario, I recommend dollar-cost averaging: buy same amount at same intervals.
Twice/month is a good one, or monthly for smaller amounts.
If you already expect to have to sell BTC, this tells me you’re over-exposed already.
Lower your holdings to where you won’t feel this pressure, and build from there as earnings come in from other sources.
You should only hold what you won’t need in the forseeable future.
Buying coins you know you may need to sell in next 6 mo or yr is a long-proven way to lose in this market.

Bitcoin is an asset designed to have a specific type of utility value.  Homes also have another type of utilitarian value.
For both, the value is not “inherent”, but subject to externalities like demand, regulations, ancilliary technology, many other factors.
When you say majority of people don’t see inherent value in BTC, you’re pointing out the utility to them is negative or marginal relative to FIAT, other established financial products, the still low BTC adoption levels, regulatory impairments, etc.

DCA is for the salaried folks with periodic income and limited "play" money, to set aside predictable amount.
DCA is not a good entry strategy if you have a set waddle of cash to buy.  Having $ in an exchange isn't great practice, parked cash just tickles your worst trading impulses and pretty soon, you're trading based on bogus hourly moves.
If you intend to HODL, just buy in and HODL.  Do DCA to accumulate as more play $ becomes available.  In 5-10 years, stories from HODL'ers that began accumulating in last 2 yrs or so, will likely sound very similar.
If you're nervous about entry price, this is probably not play money, or you're still training your HODL muscles.  Just buy what you won't need in next 3 yrs, or and amount that won't trigger you to panic sell if the coin drops 30-50% in next 6 months.

Crypto exchanges are quite fragmented, and as you point out, suffer from liquidity issues during high-volume periods.  Look at "market depth" charts on Bitstamp's Tradeview to see this in action.  So-called "market makers" make their coin holdings available for sale at set price points (or agree to buy coins at set prices).  However, currently they assume 100% of the risk for whatever they hold or agree to buy.
With futures contracts, they'll be able to hedge the downside risk of their holdings or liabilities.  Less risk per coin held means they will likely increase the amount of coins they make available for buy/sell.  This builds taller walls of bid/sale closer to the current price, as market makers profit on the volume of trades, and higher volume happens closer to the price point. 
 Bigger walls close to the price point means the exchange can fill larger orders without depleting the sellers/buyers beyond a price point....thus less tendency for the price to climb/dip...these mechanics naturally result in higher liquidity.  Liquidity being the likelihood of being able to complete a buy or sell trade at any time, for increasingly larger amount of coins at or very close to the current price.

Here's an idea:
1. Buy some "painless" fixed amount at equal time intervals (every week or every month). Painless means you've convinced yourself this is for entertainment and are OK if you lose everything. Fixed amount and fixed interval avoids the greedy buy/sell impulses that make so many lose their money trying to time bitcoin. Don't sell, don't time, don't buy more than what you would on personal entertainment.  Focus on your % gains instead of the total amount, after all, this is play money right?
2. When/if you're fortunate enough to have doubled what you put in, you'll likely already have the experience of the btc roller-coaster.  Decide if you want to increase your periodic buys at that point, again only with $ you and your cared ones can do without, and while keeping the total investment less than your gains.  Never sell....HODL.  Get yourself a hardware wallet, secure it, keep your coins yourself.
3. Once you're up &gt;100%, you can take the 50% dip in price and still be in the green....HODL!
Things to avoid at all costs:
-Buying btc with a credit card, or while carrying credit debt
-Selling btc
-Getting swayed to buy more/less based on price swings, what others have achieved, or stupid goals (i.e. "wanna have X btc by X date")
-Keeping btc in an exchange wallet.

Someday maybe, but to call today’s situation as already risky?!  Pleazzze.
Perhaps you mean there’s an opportunity to be missed by not getting some at 3k or 5k...just like there was an even better opportunity to get bitcoin back in 2013.
But to turn opportunity into risk is overselling it.
Less than 1% of world population actually owns any gold, silver, or bitcoin.
Bitcoin could overtake gold as a SoV in 10yrs maybe and it still would not be objectively risky to “not hold” it.

It's the responsibility of the trader to keep records of trades. Crypto is treated as property, where you need to track the acquisition cost (basis) and the value at time of sale or trade, for every sale or trade. "The site is down now" or "I used shapeshift" counts for nothing.

These basic talking points first came out on 8-track tapes in the mid 70’s, just in time for the re-introduction of bullion gold coins.
I agree there’s a better than average chance many will find non-inflationary assets superior to fiat...but bitcoin still has a lot of track record yet to be established.    
Buy now (better), or get next year at 16k, there’s still time to accumulate.

In US, cryptocurreny is consided property.    
Buying and moving property is not a taxable event.    
Your only tax-related responsibility when you acquire and move around is to keep track of the date acquired, amount, and initial cost.    
When you sell or otherwise pass on crypto, then you’ll have a tax event.    
@_date: 2019-01-14 08:55:14
While the coins are on the 20 addresses unspent, you are correct.    If later on you make a big purchase/transfer that requires spending from many of your addresses, someone could guess the spent accounts likely belong to same wallet if they look at transactions consolidating to a single receiving address were broadcast at same time and from same IP address.

Spending coins at a huge loss is not irrational per se.  You should read about sunk cost fallacy in decision making before cataloguing others as fools for considering this.
    
Whatever happened in the past should not impact a future decision.  Present decisions should be based purely on your expactation for the future and your current needs.     
Some should consider if spending the lossy coins allows one to offset tax liability on current fiat income.
Life events happen, and if one has cashflow needs, one should model the full impacts of a potential crypto sale.  Coins are just bits irrespective of when you got them and exchanges are there to repurchase.

IMO, the more coins ppl hodl, the more likely they are to spend or gift some of their stash, so I don’t see this as a mutually-exclusive proposition, but perhaps a delayed one.    
Thus, I seriously doubt hodling is doing more damage than good, plus it helps get bitcoin recognized as an alternative asset.    
If the hodler is keeping their exposure manageable, how would I argue against what is an essentially (albeit risky) savings strategy?    
Lastly, knowing there’s a sizeable hodler population might tip some (pricier merch) establishments to add bitcoin in order to cater to this crowd.

Functionally, a big improvement over physical bitcoins. Having the private keys unknown to anyone is awesome, and the self-contained, small form factor has a lot of potential.
If I ever need to introduce family/friend to bitcoin, this would be a nice way to get them a started with some fractional coins.  They could track their own bitcoin value before plunging in with wallet installs or exchange accounts.
Great gadget for bitcoin seminars too.
These could also work as alternative to ATM's in certain locations, and assuming they will drop in cost with volume.
Without a good measure of their long-term failure rate, I agree it would be a bad idea to load these with any significant amount of BTC.

There’s several reasons:
Efficient ASICs can be quite inaccessible to everyday entrants and thus hurt decentralization.
Desire for ASIC-like performance coupled with its inaccesibility creates the opportunity for fraud via rental “contracts” that never deliver.
Legit ASIC rentals are often connected to pools which give the owners of the units the ability to shun improvements to the protocol, even while you’re renting the hardware.  This is akin to reselling your shares in a company yet retaining voting rights. There’s some work to fix this.
ASICs give its makers a technical competitive advantage they’re not compelled to share.  Again, not conducive to decentralization.
ASICs are subject to import/export restrictions, thus easier for governments to censor.  Much more difficult to censor GPUs/CPUs/RAM.
@_date: 2018-07-22 20:07:24
Especially in the early years of development, you’d like to keep as decentralized as possible, so network stakeholders can vote with only the coin in mind.
If you own an ASIC that mines several coins, you may vote against a hard fork proposal only to keep your chain-hopping ability, even if it would benefit the coin features.  This is rarely an issue with GPU’s.
Also in play...GPU miners are typically early hodlers of the coin and contributors to the community. They stand to lose profitability of their mining ability against ASICs and no doubt have a valid case to retain decentralization and a louder voice in development forums.

A secure enclosure will get costly and sadly always risky while unattended.
Think about an extra SW component allowing the biz to collect the cash at the regular cashier, perhaps include a small comission for themselves, and print a QR code voucher the ATM can read to validate the $’s are collected.    
The user can then complete the transfer at the ATM.

These need not be in contradiction since a happy middle happens naturally.
Many that succeed building a decent HODL stack are more likely to also carry a decently-funded mobile wallet and have the means to spend satoshis when the opportunity arises.

So, yeah, HODL on...the more you HODL, the less stressed you’ll be about spending some satoshis.

IMO, you need to understand Keynesian economics to contrast Austrian and bitcoin.    Without an understanding of how Keynesian economics “work” and why it’s so entrenched, you deny yourself an appreciation of what bitcoin is up against, and of how incredible it is to have current valuation and volume.
