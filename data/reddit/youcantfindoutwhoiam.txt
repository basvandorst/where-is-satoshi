What's DerpCoin9000 can I get in on that? /s

Coinbase existed and was very functional well before 2016. He said he was flat broke. It would have taken all of an hour to get $17,500 (Coinbase max) transfered to his account that would have shown up within 5 days. Now he could have just exagerated the flat broke part...

Seriously, I think a lot of news outlets have their "Bitcoin breaks $10,000 again!" articles ready and you can expect them to be all over within the hour it breaks. After that, history will echo itself.

"Do your own research"
I'd love to find the guy who coined that first because I have seen this becoming the mark of a scam or conspiracy theories.
My wife watched a YouTube channel of conspiracy theorists who are so full of shit it's hilarious. Complete nutjob crap, and they punctuate every sentence by "dont trust us though, do your own research", except it somehow legitimates what they say to viewers who won't do the research... They just think since they open that door it must be true.
P.s. their "research" is conspiracy blogs and articles...

And consider also the customer side. Cash is such a pain to handle. First, you need to withdraw the amount you'll need. Second, if you lose it, it's gone. Third, you get change back that clutters your pocket or wherever you put it.
If a shop says they're cash only I politely tell them to fuck off. I think I use less than $20 cash a year.

They would need to have substantial money to withdraw to have an impact. The gilets jaunes are mostly in the lower class and I would argue that with France having followed the American banking system in the past years and introducing Credit vs Debit, a lot of them might be in debt.

I just want it to hit $9,000 again, just for the it's over 9,000 memes. I'm a simple man.

Now, can you explain me like I'm 3?

You could get a 1080 for $600  right now. Or you could wait for the next gen to be released (if they ever release them...) and probably get it first steal price (or the same).

What do you call mid-range? The 1060 is the first of the 10x series to support it. In the 9x series there are 970s and 980s but they are the same price or more and not as performant anyway. If you want to spend more than $300 you can check the 1070s and 1080s but that's a big price jump. The cheapest 1070 will be $489 (which is almost a normal price, it's not because of mining).

Nope. There is a 6GB on EVGA.com. The one they had for $250 is gone but it will come back in stock. If you want a 3GB right now the ZOTAC is on Amazon. However, unless you have multiple screens in 1440p you don't really need 6gb.

3gb cards can no longer mine Ethereum and nobody is building new rigs because of the future POS update on the Ethereum network so GPUs are actually affordable again. You can get a 1060 for $250 right now (in stock salmon everywhere) which is the same price as before it went up.
