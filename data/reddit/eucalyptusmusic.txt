Looking at the limitations of Bitcoin i doubt that a 300trillion market cap is anywhere near a plausible value. Bitcoin will rule the near future. It is too weak for the long term however. It is a good introduction into the Crypto-world and needed to let people know theres better ways.

* Scalability Problem
* Transaction Cost
* Counterparty Risk
* Processing Times
* 51% Flaw
* Not Quantum Safe
* Politics (Forking etc.)
Just to name a few. Don't get me wrong tho, I own Bitcoin myself and support it. Just don't think it's here to stay.

I use Exodus. But remember that sending from your Coinbase account to your wallet will add fees.

Used both. Card transferred directly. Bank took a couple days.

For me card -&gt; coinbase took a couple minutes.
Coinbase -&gt; GDAX is always instant.

I get the option when buying BTC at Coinbase. May not have communicated that correctly.
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:17:12
Yep, here. I buy them using my Coinbase account and then transfer them over to my GDAX account.

If you plan on holding BTC, and not trading i would look into cold storage as these are by far the safest methods of storing anyway. Pretty sure you can use it offline.

Nope, no fees. I can't quite remember. But i think you use your Coinbase account to log into GDAX.
