It would be nice to have a poweradapter that can be switched on by paying to its address.
so everybody can make things shared by bitcoin. like e.g. a streetlight that you turn on by paying or any kind of machinery you can think of.
examples: heater in a busstation / airpressure / water / sklilift / stove / firework / ...

I would advise you to stay away from bitcoin mining. to many miners with free energy (or someone else pays for it). one personal usecase I know of: a friend of mine had to prove that he is living in a flat by showing the electric bill - the flat is empty but miners simulate the powerusage. he doesn't care about reward.
you might try an altcoin with less difficulty and more reward. 
I mined litecoin. I stopped because of to much work with the miners (maintenance)
In my opinion bitcoin mining for the average user has only use with ideas like 21inc ( in my understanding it is like providing computer power for mining to gain access for content you would have to pay for. a great idea to get around spam and value the author of content and secure the network.
if you get bored with bitcoin you'll have to take a look at ethereum and next.

I would make some new addresses for your own research. put a small amount of BTC into it. send some by email, and place one on all exposed places you think it might have been stolen. malware will take any amount, so you can find out with your traps where the stolen key leaked out.
I have a private keys unencrypted in different places - just to check if malware is sniffing around.

compare data with others in the measurement-mesh network. it's difficult to guess or fake measurement without repeating errors. you'll get an (automatic) quality-rating of your data you don't want to loose.
@_date: 2014-11-05 17:35:24
you better get some bitcoin then you'll know the answer.
it's still a risk, that you loose your money. if it wasn't everybody would spend all their money on bitcoin. so if bitcoin will succeed, it's kind a rewad for the risk.
but I think we should just use bitcoin. I hold some but I'm much more interested in using it.

I think to understand basics and not confuse beginners with all diffrent kinds of wallets, bitcoin.org should have a simple integrated function to send btc from an address to an other. just the basic function like blockchain.info does better. once a user understands how it works he can still choose any client/webservice/whatever he likes.

1. dont use an app big amounts. make a paperwallet. apps are ok for everyday cash to carry around. paperwallet: bitaddress.org
2. no regulation. the only place where you get an insurance for your funds is circle.com
3. mining is important to generate the new bitcoins. it's the reward for keeping the network running. it has to be difficult, so noone can fraud the transactions with to much power.
4. pseudonymos - when you know who is in control of some addresses involved in a chain of transactions, it's possible to ask them about their transactions. (some investigation has to be done.)
5. it's not because it's open-source. it's because a change of the rules have to be done in consensus. roules can only be changed if everybody agrees. the rules can be very simple and opensource.
6. sorry for my english

no wallet -  but making transactions. its simple: copy paste receiver address, amount, and private key. if there is more than lets say 50$ worth of bitcoin in the senders wallet it will refuse the transaction - so it stays for test and learning purposes only. nobody will use it to send a million $ where someone can steal your private key.
simple to figure out how it works. generate some addresses and send btc around.

Every Bitcoin transaction is subject to a fee paid by the sender.
1. will future transactions cost more btc, because of the amount of data needed over the whole system will increase  ?

close/dense location = less reward
payout with a timegap. if someone gets better data with better ranking he'll get more reward. little fraud will always be possible but you'll not be able with some noise to be better then accurate measurment. most sensors have a hard-coded unique id, like a mac address. making the data readable for everybody with its unique code will be difficult to fake.
@_date: 2014-12-06 11:03:18
It's not so scary as it sounds. I'm mailing private keys around without ssl in plain text for wallets worth max 5 dollar. I'm not scared of that. but it's very useful for somone new to bitcoin playing around. (
by the way you'll have to enter your private key in blockchain.info as well if you like to transact from your former offline wallet.)
for your information: i have a watchdog script for the emails checking all the addresses. so I know if something unusual is going on. it warns me if more than 2 addresses make transactions within a certain period. up to now it never warned me. but if I lose this dollars it doesn't bother me.

I think fading is a task for later improvement. there a lots of filters, they can unfade - and knowing how the entropy will be gained would make this task easier in the future. as first step it would be enough without caring about aging of the colors.
just thinking: the software taking the entropy out of the picture could pre-age the colors with a filter. or just using black and white.
but first task will be to prove to get nough entrophy - I'm shure certain pictures will not be suitable others will - but that's the same with a strong or weak passphrase...

its like surfing with gopher or mosaic - technically you're right and I don't want to see no-features. but to have an better overview, graphically: send / receive / pending / sorting / labeling / visualization ..... there's a lot to do. that's why graphic design is a profession - programmers don't take that serious enough. usually the next gui-invetntion will get worse when new features will be invented by the programmers. then graphic design makes it usable.
right now it's like DOS 3.2 with new smartphone graphics.

It doesn't seem to be deterministic. generating a new address generates a single new keypair. it shows even the private key in plain text! I don't think that's a secure choice....

I sent for fun some BTC to these addresses. BTC was gone before it was there...
@_date: 2015-05-25 21:38:32
Given an example of 1 billion users at 10 addresses each:
    There are 2^160 or about 1,460,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 possible addresses
    In our scenario, 1,000,000,000 people are using 10 addresses each for a total of 10,000,000,000 possible addresses
    10,000,000,000 / 2^160 should yield the probability of a collision occurring
    10,000,000,000 / 2^160 = 0.00000000000000000000000000000000000000684
So the chances of a collision occurring in this scenario are approximately 0.000000000000000000000000000000000000684%
collisions are not an issue.

I think this is very great progress and we need to work on that. lot of people love pictures and I like the Idea of storing value in a picture. 
actually I'm still thinking of a way to get enough entrophy out of a picture - without using the file - by recognizing and generating the same key even when rescanned. 
(recognizing color, lines, histogramm, .....) It should give enough entrophy - I think it could be done (a QR code can do it, can be rescanned and has very low resolution) - maybe not every picture will be good enough....
thanks! I could get your .0212 bitcoin out of your picture!

(for paranoids: use it on a computer that will never see the internet again)
3. choose between wallets - all are save, I prefer BIP38 wallets with passphrase
4. print it on paper and keep it in a save place. make copies and save them somewhere elese.
5. make a copy of the share key - it's safe to use thatone on a online computer
6. send funds to that share key. and watch the address online (blockchain.info)
this ist the most basic version and helps to understand how bitcoin works.

I would try to sell you modified sniffing keyboard and mouse. but a softwaresolution is far easyier, and I'll never have to show up at your place physically.
My answer was pointing out, that baninig your wireless keyboard will not solve the problem. (same as banning an usb charger - next time a spy places a wifi sniffer in your fire detector above you. combined with a camera, to watch the keystrokes)

worst case scenario something happends like with ethereum last year: a fork. you end up having your bitcoins on both chains. when this happens and you want to spend your bitcoin make shure to spend both - BTC and BTU.
or just use an exchange and trade all your BTU for BTC and end up with more BTC. (and less BTU)
EDIT: BTC and BTU will trade at different prices. one of them might eventually die.
BIAS: I'll bet BTC will win - a nice opportunity to sell all the BTU for BTC - but who knows for shure

if you have your btc on a exchange, you have to trust a 3rd party (the exchange).
to send btc from a paperwallet simply scan your private key with a wallet app (IOS "bread wallet" or "copay") and then send it to the exchange when there is no input field for a private key (for security reasons). you can also keep all your btc on the phone (write down the recovery seed!) but it's unsafe to walk around with all your btc in your pocket.
@_date: 2016-06-15 13:26:19
good to be careful. did you manage to buy bitcoin ?
circle.com (for creditcards) or an exchange like kraken or bitstamp is probably the better choice.
@_date: 2016-06-13 12:10:42
.exe ??? seems unsafe to me !
@_date: 2016-06-16 09:28:11
you're doing pretty good. I bought myself a mycelium entropy that generates the key without a PC. 
you should really care about the version of bitaddress you download. don't do it over public internet. the version might be compromised.
I have an old IBM-labtop with windows xp (!) - it doesn't even have a build-in wifi and will never be connected to the internet. bitaddress is fine in that environment.
If you store some keys on flashdrives you might consider to encrypt and hide your files with truecrypt (edward snowden uses this tool, the nsa doesn't like it). somehow their website was taken down but it's still living in switzerland:

welcome! youre doing very well and a lot of security. probably you don't need all of that but better more than to little secure.
I use an oldoffline labtop (windows xp) with a copy of bitcoinaddress.org on it to generate paperwallets. an other nice gadget for longtimestorage is mycelium entropy that creates wallets offline.
I created a couple honeypots to check if my system is somehow compromised. (open paperwallets on my desktopcomputer, my desk, in the office..... none where gone yet. only one in my personal mediawiki)

is fine. if you're paranoid, copy the html file to an offline computer that never sees the internet again and generate your wallets there in a browser.
extra safety:
make wallets with passphrase and make multiple copies and store them in different places. place honeypots with no passphrase and a small amount on your computer and elsewhere to check if they are  compromised.

stop loss sell is also a bad idea. slippage will hit your stop loss and you caught a falling knife!
if you analyze markets properly you'll have enough time for sending your coins to bitstamp. if you're daytrading then you'll have to trust the exchange, and you'll have to have all your tradingcoins on a exchange.

bitcoin does not have a physical form. on your hard drive, paperwallet or .... is only a "right" to spend bitcoin. this right (secret key) can have physical form if you write it on paper. but you could just remeber it in your brain...
for buying an selling bitcoin with creditcard (visa) I use circle.com.
with some wallet-software or online-wallets you can import private keys and you get control of the same wallets wherever you do that. 
but be carful - I do this only with small amounts, because it's unsecure to use a wallet with an exposed private key to the internet.

blockchain.info is fine for small amounts.
for big savings use a coldwallet. you can generate them with:

thanks, but:
 1. ...would be like a passphrase "12345" so don't take uniform piuctures. any pictures with a background (clouds, nature, not just blue sky...) would have way much more randomness as any brainwallet.
 2. camerasensor errors sould be excepted. I think to regenerate the key by scanning the same picture - there will be new errors when scanning that should not affect the key.
there is digital face-recognition so I think technology is not so far away from that. (how many faces can be recognized ? now we have trees, cars, buildings, whatever you could think of - and combinations of all that ...)

daily softwaresubscriptions - we would love to use professional software but it's to expensive if we just need it once in a while. e.g. autocad to fix some stuff and then export it to our licensed cad-software. when I could activate autocad with bitcoin and would only have to pay when I effectivly use it.

breadwallet is my wallet like my real wallet with about 100$ in it. cold storage's private key are offline, printed and hold your savings. to move bitcoin into coldstorage you can send them to your public key generated with bitaddress.org. generate as many addresses as you want. your clients, merchants and so on will have diffrent addresses.
use their withdraw function to send bitcoin to your cold storage.
to spend from cold storage you can use blockchain.info "import a wallet".
for huge amounts be shure to spend all of the cold sorage's bitcoin and put the unused change into a new cold storage.

the private key is not just a passwort.
generate a keypair with

other wallets generate the private key out of a 24-word seed.
this seed generates multiple private keys, so you only need to save your seed.

ok, if a website gave you y key it doesn't seem to be a private key. to unsecure to be sent ofer the internet. this sounds more like a propretary link of that specific website.
in case you used  it is indeed a private key - generated in a script on your computer and not sent across the net. use this service offline on a secure computer.
