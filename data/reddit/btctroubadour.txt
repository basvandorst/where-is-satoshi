Yeah. Won't that just ensure that people are "curating" likeable content, i.e. content that they expect lots of others to curate, while not curating good-but-niche content?
If this gets popular, people will set up sweat shops for posting likeable content (as a way to make money), and develop all kinds of pyramid-like schemes around it, just like you're eluding to.
Financial incentives are a delicate thing and one of the major innovations that Bitcoin got right (right enough). It distorts everything it touches.

I guess in this case Ethereum's "balance" model (as opposed to Bitcoin's UTXO model) makes more sense. It's mostly the number of (indivisible) tokens that matters, not the specific outputs that created them.
Not sure if that accounts for all of the discrepancy, though.
Perhaps the stated policy on - or expected outcome for - long-term fees also contributes to it? Being able to move such tokens are probably more important than long-term storage (of their value)?

If you sent your LTC to an address generated by your Ledger Nano S Bitcoin wallet, it should be completely recoverable (since the keys to that address can be derived from your seed/backup words).

Yes, should be possible to recover as long as you control the keys (which it seems like you do).
If you have the Bitcoin-encoded private key, you can convert it to a Litecoin-encoded key (so that it can be imported in LTC wallets) by doing only step 6 to 8 of this guide: 
(If you want to use Litecoin Core for the recovery, you can follow the rest of the steps of that guide as well.)

Sure, checking the [address prefix]( (also called the "version byte") wouldn't be hard to do. It isn't perfect, though.
The root cause is that Litecoin, when they copied Bitcoin's P2SH code, *didn't* change the version byte, thus both Litecoin-segwit and Bitcoin-segwit addresses ended up with the same `3`-prefix. (This is in contrast to regular, now often called "legacy", P2PKH addresses, where Bitcoin has a version byte that leads to a `1`-prefix whereas Litecoin has a version byte that leads to a `L`-prefix.)
After realizing the problems this caused, the Litecoin devs eventually got around to changing the version byte so that P2SH addresses (including the typical, P2SH-wrapped segwit addresses) got an `M`-prefix instead, but a lot of services haven't updated their code to reflect this change in Litecoin Core.
And either way, the `3`-prefixed addresses will probably need to be kept for *backwards compatibility* with other software that isn't being updated anyway - the end result being that it really is impossible for an exchange to know if an address with a `3`-prefix was meant, by the receiving wallet, to be used for receiving LTC or BTC. But the exchanges (like Coinbase) could, at the very least, have supported the new `M`-addresses.
(Incidentally, the same problem exists with BCH's `1`- and `3`-prefix addresses, since the Bitcoin Cash devs *also* didn't change the version byte before launch, leading to [an even worse problem]( This will, apparently, be fixed by a bech32-based addressing scheme to be launched in january... But then the question is the same as for Litecoin: How soon will the ecosystem update - and how long will they support the old-style addresses?)
@_date: 2017-12-13 06:22:59
If you sent it to Crypterium, they are probably the ones controlling the keys to the address you sent to? That means I can't help you and you'll have to ask their customer (investor?) support (if they have one?) for help. Their tech guys can fix it for you, if they're willing to. Good luck. :)

Of course I'm not saying that it isn't going to the miners. I'm saying that the subsidy has nothing to do with the transactions they choose (or not) to include in a block.
You're falling for the classical logical fallacy of equating correlation and causality. It's not a transaction subsidy just because the miners also "process" transactions, **just like your wage isn't a step subsidy just because you walk every day**.
The purpose of the coinbase transaction is money distribution and network security; nothing more, nothing less.
@_date: 2015-06-05 23:01:55


That's not obvious. In fact, it's wrong. I've pointed out the exact purpose of the subsidy several times now. If you just don't see it, and don't have any arguments besides asserting that your conclusion is obviously right, even when it isn't, then we're done here.


That's a good idea, but you've got it the wrong way around. I'll try one more time:
1. We can agree that the amount of bitcoins has nothing to do with the number of transactions, right? (The subsidy/inflation is known in advance, hard-wired into the Bitcoin protocol.)
2. Further, the "dollar value" of the subsidy depends on the market price of the subsidy. At the moment, the dollar value of a coinbase transaction is roughly $5,625. (Again, this isn't related to the number of transactions in the subsidized block.)
3. Miners will continue to mine as long as it's profitable, i.e. their equipment+electricity cost over time is roughly equal to the subsidy. Rational miners, i.e. most of them, will stop mining once it's more expensive to mine the bitcoins than it is to buy them directly. (Once more, this isn't related to the number of transactions in the subsidized block.)
4. Now, what is the "cost" of creating a block? Over time it will tend towards the point where [marginal revenue equals marginal cost]( right?
Still with me? We have now arrived at what you call "the cost of processing transactions" without involving transactions at all. It's because it's NOT actually the cost of processing transactions, but the cost of creating a block, you're just confusing the two (which is understandable, but still wrong).
The "cost" is ONLY derived from the market value and the monetary supply inflation formula.
The subsidy is fixed (in terms of bitcoins), it doesn't change to match the cost of miners. Miners THEN look at the value of the subsidy and throw more hashing power at it (as long as it's profitable), NOT the other way around.
The cost (aka electricity spent) is a function of market value, NOT the transactions that are being processed.
@_date: 2015-06-06 00:49:41


Fair enough.
We agree agree on the part that security is derived from the value of the coinbase subsidy. This is (one of the reasons) why the mining process (but not the transactions) is subsidized at all.
We disagree on whether you can view the subsidy/inflation as a transaction cost. In my opinion you can't, from any perspective, as the block subsidy is algorithmically pre-determined and is [unrelated to the number of transactions processed](
I guess it boils down to semantics of what transaction processing really means. But if you conflate network security and transaction processing, you end up with a confusing mental model - and not the one from which miners actually derive their processing decisions. Thus, it's both unhelpful and makes the two issues difficult to discuss separately.

The miners are being "subsidized", not the transactions.
"Processing" transactions (i.e. including them in a block) is optional and does not add to a miner's cost. Miners can produce blocks with 0 transactions (except the coinbase) and still get the same subsidy.
The "subsidy" is an arguably(?) fair way to distribute the initial money supply over time AND an incentive to secure the network (by adding more hashing power).

A user purchases something "from" Bitcoin address A. A single stack (input) of bitcoins is thus typically divided into two: Some goes to the merchant's address X, the rest (change) goes to the next address in the user's HD wallet account, address B. So far there's no way to tell, just from looking at the blockchain, which of the outputs (address X or address B) belong to the user.
Next up, someone who wants to track the user sends some dust to address A.
Because most mobile wallets treat any unspent money in any of the user's addresses (that belong to the same HD wallet account) as a single balance, the user will now see a single balance that includes both the dust (in address A) and the change from the last transaction (in address B).
Next time he spends (or at any other point in the future), the wallet **may** combine both address A and B in a single transaction, thus showing the observer that address X belonged to a merchant and address B belongs to the same user as address A.
(This can be done for longer chains of spends/transactions too, of course, linking (and thus deanonymizing) addresses long after their first use, invalidating CoinJoin obfuscation, etc.)

I don't think many advocate bitcoin as a solution for this (at least in a system with next to no bitcoin adoption).
What people are rooting for is more of a long-term educational process where people may realize that if they had bitcoins instead of IOUs from a bank, failing systems with capital controls wouldn't freeze their funds in the first place.
Of course, people shouldn't put all their money in bitcoin (for various reasons) just like that, but knowing that there exists an alternative is a good idea anyway.

It's a digital currency. In order to use it in a brick-and-mortar shop, the merchant would have to accept it (i.e. have it integrated in their payment system), which isn't common (yet).
It's mostly used online, where its properties render it superior to other forms of payment (you don't have to trust the merchant with your card info, transactions are irreversible, etc.), but the real hype is about what the technology will *become*, not what it is today.
If you want a primer on what it can become, start [here](
It's also historically been embraced by libertarians as a way to opt out of centrally controlled money (i.e. whoever doesn't like central banking - and that monetary policies are controlled by politicians). It's issued at a pre-determined and diminishing rate to whoever helps sustain the payment network, in a way that guarantees that there will only ever be ~21 million bitcoins.
It essentially turns money into digital information/content, so it's about as uncensorable as file sharing.

Yes, but once you've bought the bitcoins you can send them to an external wallet that only you control.
These bitcoins can be traced back to you and your identity (through Coinbase/Circle), though, so if your goal is being anonymous you'd need to buy bitcoins off someone in-person (e.g. localbitcoins / mycelium trader) - and a whole lot of other things to *stay* anonymous.

"Mining" (an unfortunately convoluted term) means: Devoting computing power to securely processing bitcoin transactions and getting a reward (i.e. bitcoins) for doing so.
I believe it's called mining because of the similarities to digging for gold (i.e. you turn effort into a reward; and bitcoin is often called "digital gold" due to its scarcity).
Years ago (2009-2011), people did this by downloading the Bitcoin-Qt program (at the time the only Bitcoin program) and dedicating their CPU to this purpose.
As bitcoins got valuable, more and more people got into it (meaning less rewards for each miner). Eventually people built chips specifically for this purpose (i.e. [ASIC]( which got so powerful that trying to mine using your home computer now is just a good way to run up your electricity bill with *nothing* to show for it.
Nowadays, Bitcoin mining has gravitated to large datacenters (due to economy of scale) in places with cheap electricity (Iceland, China, etc.). [Here]( a rare look into a mining facility in China.
TLDR: Don't bother mining unless it's just for fun (i.e. you'll lose money doing it) or for learning the inner technical details of Bitcoin (i.e. not for beginners).

@_date: 2015-06-06 00:19:10


True, but in order to achieve that you need a lot of cogs to work together as a whole. The subsidy takes care of two of the things you need:
1. Distributing the actual units that you're going to transact in a "fair" way (i.e. electricity spent = bitcoin earned). Bitcoins are just the units of account in the Bitcoin ledger, after all.
2. The transactions need to be secure and trustworthy/irreversible. (This part only works reliably after the subsidy has a sufficient market value, which is why most altcoin transactions aren't "secure enough".)


Ok, I'll concede this if you're thinking in a *very* indirect way. But not in the sense that you can assign the inflation cost to the kilobytes of processed transactions at any point in time.
In your model, what was the dollar cost per kilobyte in 2009/2010 (before bitcoins had any marketable value)?
And why is the cost of transacting now 225x more expensive than when bitcoins were worth $1?
I hope you see that there's two processes at work in parallel here: One is subsidizing miners (so that they'll throw enough computing power into the network to make it hard to attack). Another is bribing miners with a transaction fee (so that they'll include *your* transactions in their blocks).
Obviously, miners generally have an investment in bitcoin, so they won't want the network/currency to fail. That only means they'll accept less transaction fees, due to seeing the large picture, than they otherwise would.
Mining is a complex thing to wrap one's head about, which is why most people (including me) need months or years to fully appreciate the subtleties and economics of it. Your heading ("$5.625 per kilobyte to process transactions") is waaay too blunt - and imho very misleading. ;)

I understand his(?) mental model, but it's still wrong.

$25 per block, right? (Plus optional transaction fees.)

Yes, but not directly. Deterministic wallets use an algorithm which specifies how to generate a sequence of private keys (and thus, their associated public keys/addresses) from a seed/master key.
So while each private key only controls one particular address, you still only need the original seed/master key as the rest of the private keys can be re-generated on the fly when they're needed.

You're correct, but the part you may be missing is that his [steganography]( examples was in the context of someone trying to censor Bitcoin transactions, his point being that if you allow ANY kind of information exchange at all, Bitcoin transactions can be encoded/"hidden" inside that information. Thus, it would appear 
As long as both the sender and receiver agrees on a way to encode data insider other data, they can "hide in plain sight" whatever they want.
There's no standard way of doing this, though, so whatever scheme they used have to be a custom protocol agreed directly upon between the two parties. (If it was made into a standard, the censoring entity could decode and block it, as the information would then no longer be hidden.)
@_date: 2014-10-11 13:34:51


Yup, and this goes all the way back to the origins of Bitcoin. I'll let Satoshi do the talking:
"[The root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that’s required to make it work.

Banks must be trusted to hold our money and transfer it electronically, but they lend it out in waves of credit bubbles with barely a fraction in reserve.](

Either 1) by knowing/counting the number of used addresses before the one you sent to or 2) by just finding it in the list of addresses on the BIP39 page.
To do 1) on the Ledger Nano S, select the account, then click the "See All Operations" button in the upper right-hand corner, then count the number of addresses used for incoming transactions (i.e. the ones with "to" in front of them. Start counting chronologically (i.e. from the bottom), with the first address being 0, the second being 1, etc. If your address isn't listed, it's probably because it is the current receiving address. If that's the case, click the "Receive" button at the top, confirm that it actually matches the address your LTC were sent to. If you received, for example, 5 previous incoming txs to this account (i.e. you have 5 "to"-addresses in the "all operations" list), the current receiving address with be the 6th address, i.e. an index of 5 (not 6, since the index starts counting at 0).

It needs to decrease in order to have a finite supply. Of course you could have a linear "minting" algorithm, and then abruptly stop the flow. But, at least to me, a gradual change seems more reasonable. Remember, supply increases linearly for ~4 years at a time, which should give the economy around it ample time to adjust.
Unequal distribution is a non-issue at the current state of affairs. If the owners are ever going to see the value of their bitcoins, they'll have to use them - which means distributing them (to new owners).
Initial distribution of bitcoins doesn't really matter, just as initial stock distribution of a startup (100% owned by founders) doesn't really matter.

In theory, yes. But that's the same as saying "putting all your money in one account is less secure than putting everything in one".
Point being - if it would be possible to find the private key of even a single address that you only knew the address/contents of, Bitcoin would be bust.

Some caution is warranted, for sure, which is why everyone's saying you shouldn't put more into bitcoin(s) than you can afford to lose (i.e. there's a real change that everything will crash to near-$0).
But just for the sake of it, suppose a digital currency eventually got mass adoption. How do you think its path from zero to wide acceptance would look? Would it be dissimilar to Bitcoin's?
Remember, bootstrapping an extranational currency - with no backing - is obviously going to be a bumpy ride, and quite different from building a service on top of existing financial infrastructure (like PayPal). This is uncharted territory (unless you count historical commodity "currencies" like gold - but I'm pretty sure the timeline difference makes those hard to compare), but if you believe in [network effects]( isn't it given that it won't be a smooth linear, predictable growth?

They could commit to paying only a particular fixed amount each day/week/whatever and then let all the bitcoin participants share it. It'd work almost like mining  - i.e. a fixed reward that's spread out according to contribution. It would self-regulate in the sense that when the reward becomes too small for people to bother doing it, you'd have the network size you were looking for.

Well, gold supplies (obviously) don't magically expand along with the rate in which the governments print money. Check out this graph:
To me it looks like the printing of money wasn't done to cater to an organically growing economy, but to cover costs that couldn't otherwise be afforded (e.g. wars, foreign aid, etc.). What do you think?
This is why some people say that Bitcoin has the power to end (otherwise unaffordable) wars. Game theory may suggest that people wouldn't pay for (most) wars, if they had to pay from their own pockets (i.e. if they had a choice). With the hidden taxation of inflated money supply, governments can pay for anything, and people only feel the costs through indirect effects.


In a sense, this "democracy" is already ongoing. Some altcoins have inflationary policies -- and (some) altcoins are ultimately just a Bitcoin codebase patched with alternative policies. They aren't doing too well, popularity-wise, so far.
If you're talking about a controlled in-chain vote, as opposed to a straight-up fork, that already happened with the P2SH vs. OP_EVAL situation in the spring of 2012, where you could vote on the direction of development through computing power (mining).

For the analogy to be right, you'd have to sell the PS4 for $400 when you borrowed it and put up some collateral, too, e.g. $50. A third party would then hold the $400 you got from the sale and the $50 collateral, and if the price ever hit $450, you'd be forced to buy a PS4 at that time (short squeeze) as you couldn't afford buying back the PS4 at any higher price. Also, you'd have to account for the loan interest that makes this deal financially interesting for the original owner in the first place.

Irrelevant for the scenario we're discussing now. This thread is based on the assumption that normal people would use banks, i.e. they wouldn't need to handle Bitcoin security themselves. My list were suggestions why people would still favour Bitcoin, even if they used it through a bank, as a direct response to your question. I'm starting to doubt the sincerity of your question. Please convince me I'm wrong.


Since we're discussing Bitcoin banks, I'm not sure if you're trolling or just forgot what your wrote in your post. Banks will obviously have a lot more options for securing their bitcoins (given that they're programmable) than regular fiat-ledger-currencies. You have explored the scenarios they could set up simply by using e.g. multisig, right?


As in writing checks to pay for what you need? Uh, that sure sounds efficient. In my country we haven't seen checks since the last century. Also, my company is charged ~$1 for each bill it pays using its online bank account, plus ~$20 as a fixed monthly fee.


Then that point doesn't apply to you. That doesn't mean it won't count for millions of others. Remember, we're talking about a hypothetical situation here?


Check your privilege. Also, your arrogance.


Ok, mr. Isolationist. In my country, it's rare for people NOT to leave their country for vacation, at least once a year, but more commonly 2-3 times a year. Not having to worry about foreign currency is one of my primary convenience reasons for wishing Bitcoin to succeed.


Are you sure about that? Are we really at the end of the UI/UX road with banks and their "development"? I don't know how banks' online systems look in your country, but in mine they look downright awful compared to anything a $100k startup would create.
Also, I'm sure people thought snail mail and newspapers were convenient - at the time.
Any reason you didn't comment on the point about deterministic inflation, even just to say that you agreed on that one? That's a big one for Bitcoin, you know. ;)

[2 years ago, one bitcoin was worth $14]( so it's actually UP 2400% in that time frame.

It would have as many bits.
Entropy, however, is sort of like the opposite of predictability. If you do a perfectly random coin flip 256 times, you'd have no predictability (= 100% entropy), i.e. 256 bits of entropy.
If you know something about the situation, or algorithm, in which the numbers were generated that gives you an edge in predicting what those numbers would end up as, the generated number(s) would have less entropy.
Describing entropy is contextual and thus never precise. If you find a weakness in a (supposed) random number generator, you'd have to downgrade the assumed entropy of its numbers retroactively. The numbers themselves didn't change, but your knowledge of how they came to be was, thus affecting their entropy. See? :D

I didn't say finite supply was necessary for anything. I said that the "**rate of growing**" (from the post before mine) needs to decrease in order to have a finite monetary supply (if that's a goal, as it seems to be with Bitcoin).

The blockchain (ledger) is stored by the nodes in the p2p network that maintains it (i.e. anyone willing to contribute cpu/bandwidth).
Anyone can "see the balances on the ledger", either by connecting directly to the network (using a Bitcoin client) - or indirectly by using some website/API that provides access to the same data, for example 
Wallet software store one or more keys (similar to passwords, but with some important mathematical properties), each of which gives access to a Bitcoin address (similar to an account number, i.e. an "account" in the ledger), and also provides a user interface so that you can see the balances and create transactions.
(It can get more complicated than that, with multi-signature addresses, HD wallets and whatnot, but don't let's not focus on the advanced topics yet.)
So, the bitcoins themselves (i.e. the units of account of the blockchain/ledger) are stored "in the cloud", while the keys that gives you access to your accounts are stored locally.
To computers, a key is essentially just a large number, so in theory it can be stored wherever and however you'd like (but there's a few common encodings). Most wallet software provide a way to back up or export the key(s), some encrypt them so that passers-by cannot steal your bitcoin without also knowing the encryption passphrase, some advice you to write the keys down on a piece of paper (or print out) - typically known as "cold" or offline storage, etc.
It's really just like any digital file: If you lose/delete it without backup, it's gone.
Most wallets also provide a means for importing backups/exports from other wallets (or previous versions of itself).
Also, here's some vids that may help:

Oh, so we're talking annual percentage increase of the monetary supply. Tell me, then, how to bootstrap a currency without an "astronomical" (in fact infinite when going from zero to something) inflation at the start? Your advice makes sense in the fiat world, but not so much for a decentralized currency emerging from nothing.
What about analyzing it in terms of real value being "minted" into the economy daily? I think you'll find that for most of Bitcoin's lifetime, this figure has gradually (but not monotonically) increased. And it's regular market dynamics that control this. Is it really that bad?
How would *you* have bootstrapped a new kind of currency?

The value of one currency with regards to another is determined by the market, i.e. the [foreign exchange markets](
Currencies were historically pegged to a commodity, typically gold/silver, but through a range of events in the last century that finally stopped altogether. In 1971, Nixon was forced to "unpeg" USD from gold, thus ending its convertibility into a fixed amount of gold.
Since then, all currencies have been "floating" with regards to each other, all determined by your old market forces of demand and supply (which again are determined by a lot of factors, among them the nation's economy, as you mention, but also pure speculation - almost like stocks).
A lot of people make their living off selling and buying currencies, trying to predict their relative movements.
Bitcoin (BTC or XBT) is just another currency in this mix. It can be traded for other currencies on various Bitcoin exchanges (websites), the largest of which at the moment is [Bitstamp](
There's tons of websites where you can follow how BTC's value develops relative to USD/EUR/etc., e.g.  - or more "technical" sites like  and 
And yes, Bitcoin has introduced a lot of us to a whole new world of economic/financial/monetary knowledge and interest. Welcome to the rabbit hole. ;)
@_date: 2014-10-13 01:09:10
But USD/gold/whatever doesn't undermine their ability to exercise fiscal power in their own jurisdiction, while BTC does. If they prop up BTC's value by using it as a reserve, aren't they indirectly shooting themselves in the foot?

(Why doesn't the "read more" link under Decentralized on  work?)
Edit: Ok, posts in other parts of the thread makes this system clearer. It's not pegging (i.e. the "fixed value" that the OP asks for), it's a derivative market that ensures some stability. There's still systemic risk in that it cannot handle a large or persistent drop in price/interest of BTS.

@_date: 2014-12-13 20:01:24
No (well, not if it's supposed to be a decentralized currency). Pegging would mean that some party guarantees that you can always redeem a certain amount of whatever it's pegged to for each unit of Bitcoin.
Who would give this guarantee? If Bitcoin dropped in value, a lot of people would trade it in for whatever it was pegged to. If Bitcoin's value increased, the flow would be the other way.
Either way the entity that made the guarantee would lose money. And for that reason no one would trust the peg to last, rendering it worthless to begin with.
Pegging a digital currency to something would require the guarantor [is that a word? :P] to control the issuance of the digital currency, so that the currency units would equal the reserve of whatever it was pegged to.
@_date: 2014-10-12 00:27:44
Good thinking. The process still needs a way for the voters to know/trust that their vote isn't being tracked by (someone in) the government, though. :)
Edit: Didn't read  carefully enough. That point takes care of it if the voter can be certain that the pile he gets to choose from actually contains different keys and that there's enough simultaneous voters at the location (so that his vote can't just be determined based on the time it was placed).

It wouldn't be Bitcoin - and it wouldn't work.
"Proof-of-work" can be thought of as "working-is-voting". It's brilliant - and necessary, if you think about it.
Mining also has a purpose in currency issuance (minting new "coins"). Bitcoins are awarded according to work, which is a heck of a lot better than other solutions. It also doubles as an incentive, which made sure that the network could bootstrap itself in the first place, and sustain itself for years to come.
The electricity "wasted" is a function of bitcoin's price and the rate of issuance.

That depends on your exact definition of those terms. Our language and semantics change all the time, so with a new phenomenon like bitcoin it's not unnatural to expect the definitions to change over time.
If you at first accept the concept of *digital cash* (i.e. a digital commodity that has more or less all the traits of ordinary cash) it's not a stretch to call bitcoin "[money in the form of cash that is readily available]( (as opposed to a promise of future money, like a check).

Yup, you're racing against a signed nLockTime-transaction which is in your adversaries' possession.
You don't necessarily need to see the transaction itself in order to know its timing. This could be a part of the security mechanism of whoever you're attacking, e.g. the way Greenaddress is doing it.
If you can't get to the bitcoins before the deadline, they'll automatically be transferred to some other (safe) address where you can't get 'em.
@_date: 2014-11-20 02:56:09
Hashing still has nothing to do with what you defined mining as. Hashing is the 'work' part of proof-of-work, which in the context of the Bitcoin is used as an [arguably?] fair way of distributing bitcoin ("minting", i.e. coinbase transactions), which again serves as incentive for mining.
TLDR: If you want to define mining, you need to incorporate its role in bitcoin distribution.

I feel as though the latter part of your response implies that I said that the two are inseparable, which I did not.
I was merely trying to point out why it's relatively easy for (most) people to accept that the technology has value while having a hard time accepting that the currency does.
And it's not solely because they disagree with the particular monetary policy that's hard-wired into the Bitcoin protocol specifically. Most of them would have just as much trouble accepting cryptocurrencies with any policy or backing (inflationary altcoins, a currently theoretical, but possible, USD-backed coin, etc.).
So, to sum up: I agree with your point. Do you agree with mine? ;)

Neither have I - I'm too young to have experienced anything like it. ;)
But here's someone talking about why we shouldn't be scared:
I also like this comment, below the video:
"Deflation is often a response to a depression. A drop in demand results in a drop in prices. This is good for consumers because they have less money to spend. This puts downward pressure on wages so businesses can afford to hire more people. Deflation acts like a shock absorber. In an opposite manner inflation acts to prevent scarcity of goods. Both, IMO, are necessary to a well functioning economy."
Sounds reasonable to me (but what do I know?).

Good post! At the end you seem to jump to conclusions, though:


As OP said, we've never actually had a fixed-supply currency before (and technically we won't for another 100+ years, but you know what I mean). How can you *already* know how this will play out and what needs to be done to fix it?
What happened to the *discussion* part of your post:


How do you know we won't adapt to a deflationary currency? Human nature, as you call it, does include extreme adaptability, doesn't it?
Besides, you have to look at the incentives at an individual level too, not just the societal level -- i.e. game theory.
Implementing inflation is all nice and dandy when some super-entity (govt.) can decide what will be the best monetary policy for society as a whole (and have the means to enforce it as well), but Bitcoin puts monetary control in the hands of the individual - if they so choose. Bitcoin is a way to opt out of the centrally-controlled "monetary formulas".
How would you make the individuals choose the "monetary formula" that's best for the society even when it's worse for themselves? Violence?

Not if you're talking about full-fledged and properly decentralized two-way pegged sidechains or easily usable zero-conf-safe micropayment channels, but... I think he's referring to the kind of off-chain solutions we have today, like Changetip, Coinbase-to-Coinbase payments, exchange trading, etc.

For Android: Mycelium (for ease of use and portability) when you only have a small amount of bitcoins. Connect it to a Trezor (which can be imported as a hardware wallet in Mycelium) when you buy more. The Trezor keeps your keys offline ("cold"), i.e. very hard for a hacker to get access to.
This provides a reasonable learning curve and very good security (by the time you buy a Trezor) without sacrificing usability.
Good luck. :)

We're really starting to use "backing" very loosely here. :D And anyway, it's Bitcoin's lack of (real) backing that affords it its independence. Then, people can spin that as a negative or a positive, depending on their beliefs or agenda.


Sure, but that goes for anything that's based on supply/demand. If you just magically assume a black swan event, obviously it will affect value. But there's not much to learn from magic. Now give a good reason for that all exchanges suddenly laying down their business, and we can start having a real discussion about probabilities and effects.
All cryptocurrencies have been there already, though - rising in value from no adoption, no acceptance and (almost) no utility. Network effects are powerful stuff. ;)

It all comes down to whether you've wet your feet or not in the Bitcoin world before the transaction.
If you already have the bitcoins, and the recipient has an easy way to spend/convert them, WU will look very bad in comparison.
However, if you only have USD and need to go through the process of registering with exchanges on both ends, then exchanging in and out of bitcoin, it may just be more cumbersome or expensive (or both), depending on the situation.
In my mind what the WU vs. Bitcoin ads really show is how superior Bitcoin is IF you've embraced it already, and I don't think it's unfair to make that assumption when comparing two systems on their own merits.
Anything else would be like comparing snail-mail to email where "emailing" means scanning a physical letter, sending it as an attachment, and printing it out as a physical letter on the other end. Which just wouldn't make sense when trying to explain someone why email was a superior and up-and-coming technology.

And how do we do that? Create a system that doesn't tend to false dichotomies all the time.


...which is inherent to the problem at hand. In my mind it's a premise we have work with, not just "inform" people to get better at.


And what made the society change? My bet world be on opposition that borders on the criminal, not informing people to vote better.




I didn't read this one thoroughly, but it seems to me he's advocating for reasoning "correctly" (i.e. overcome our biases, as opposed to creating systems which accept them as part of being human), yet there's no reason to believe we'd ever come to an agreement on what's "correct"?

Fair enough. It'll be hard to tell who's right, then.
It's my impression that the decentralization (i.e. no way to control/regulate it at its core) and pure novelty, is what puts most people off - i.e. an instinctive reaction, which we've probably all had at some point, that "that can't work". Then it evolves to "can it work?" and finally "this could actually work", for those who look into it. Only then does the monetary policy embedded in a particular blockchain algorithm become interesting - and the debate will then revolve around which policy would be the better, as opposed to dismissing the currency aspect altogether.
(Un)fortunately, only one coin has enough adoption to be (semi)viable at the moment, so we're pretty much stuck with the policy Satoshi envisioned, whether we like it or not. :)

Yeah, and my two nodes have 12k and 15k, running default policies. I guess they may have tweaked the minimal allowable fee per kB, mempool memory size, or are simply connected to a different set of peers.
Either way, the ~40k backlog that got into their mempool is now cleared - and by all reasonable assumptions is now part of the block chain.

Somewhat, although they were a bit heavy on rhetoric and did more to describe the current situation than coming up with new insights or solutions. I guess I prefer less verbosity and more substance. ;)


It's not a swindle, it's the natural mechanics of human psychology (we really haven't evolved past tribal enmity yet) and game theory. It's the only logical outcome of *the current system*.
(As for the "cave experiment", there's other studies showing the same, e.g. the infamous [Stanford prison experiment]( upon which [The Experiment]( is based. You can also casually observe it in your everyday life.)


A good point about mislabeling things is made, but then he veers off into a not-so-good analysis of voters' power, imho. "Democracy" isn't well-defined and there's ways to upgrade to a (far) better system without leaving the democracy paradigm.


Yep, I agree that we shouldn't vote for "lizards". But why nag about voting patterns inside the system without trying to identify the root of the problem (e.g. the voting system)? (And what's up with using the sex-with-condoms example all the time? That's a lot more complicated issue than he gives it credit for.)


What if none of them represent me well?
Selecting for electability the natural state for first-past-the-post systems, cf. the "[Politics in the Animal Kingdom]( series.
As long as this is true, in what way is less ignorance going to fix this problem *within the system*?


Counter-intuitively, it turns out that public voting may actually help the elite, not the people, cf. D'Angelo's "[Crucial Flaw in Democracy &amp; $5 Solution](
As long as this is true, in what way is good data going to fix this problem *within the system*?


Let's say you were able to make a plan, with every step actually going exactly as planned, what would your plan look like? What's the steps that's needed for us to overcome all your ifs? I imagine your plan to be somewhat naive (unless it starts with making serious changes to the system), but feel free to amaze me. :P

1. So, who *are* your customers? Primarily individuals who temporarily may set up a hot spot here or there - or primarily companies who'd be more or less permanently setting up a metered hot spot at their location? I feel the distinction is important, both business plan wise and UI wise. E.g. if it's individuals, the first "welcome page" should include an estimate of how long the temporary hot spot will stay around, so you're not paying for 5 hours only to have it disappear 30 minutes hence.
2. How's the payment transaction sent when you aren't (fully) connected to the internet yet? Is there a specific exception for packets that look like Bitcoin transaction, either based on port number or known IP addresses (e.g. Mycelium's SPV-providing servers) - or is there a grace period in which you're fully connected? What if the tx is relayed through a web API making it more or less indistinguishable from other web traffic (which is redirected to the raspi's welcome page)?

A pool directs its users' hashing power, which the users voluntarily contribute to that pool. Once the pool misuses their trust, users can switch in a matter of minutes (seconds if they're already set up with another pool).
Pools don't threaten the consensus in the same way that a huge mining farm controlled by a single entity would.

Something P2Pool-ish, with a suitable pool share difficulty, share chain and block time (target)? There could be several "levels" for different devices (based on their chip's # of cores, i.e. hashing power).
Or perhaps that's too wasteful and they'll just run a regular centralized pool with (semi-)regular satoshi showers.
Either way, they'll need to find a way to distribute the satoshis to thousands, or millions, of devices/addresses. Perhaps that's where the side chains enters the picture and the devices really only operate on a coin which is backed by bitcoin, not actual satoshis.

Oh, they do.
There are TONS of individuals and companies that say they are choosing to build on top of Bitcoin because it's the most secure blockchain, an effect *directly* afforded by miners.
And there's TONS of end-users chosing Bitcoin because of its security, utility and ecosystem, which is if not directly, then at least very closely correlated to, the previous point about why people build things for Bitcoin in the first place.
And you've been here long enough to know that, so I really don't understand why you're trying to sell short the miners' contribution?


They do, or at least have done historically, but it's OTC. They enable whales to enter the market without making too large waves - and some of them are large-scale holders themselves (willingness to hodl one requirement for a currency getting and maintaining value, but I'm sure you know that).


True, we're thankfully(!) not dependent upon *individual* miners, but we are certainly dependent upon miners as a whole.


Ok, so that's a *reason*, I'll grant you that, but I don't think it's a good reason long-term. But that's a matter of opinion where I *could* be wrong, so I won't spend time arguing over that (as long as you acknowledge that it's possible to take my position as well ;)). I think the known risks of "firing the miners" are, at least currently, *much* higher than the benefits. And that's before even looking into the technical implementation details of a UASF.


True, but it seems to me that they are more empathetic with the frustrations of the users than the Core devs have been, lately. Case(s) in point:
\- AntPool just mined a BU block (that's the thread we're in, after all). Why would they do that if they didn't intend to support blocksize increases asasp?
\- Overall, miners have made sure to clear out tx backlogs in the 8 years leading up 'till today's congestion problems. Why would they do that if they *wanted* congestion and higher fees rather than good usability and increased adoption?
\- We've talked about the underlying long-term economic incentives of Bitcoin before. Why would miners, who have one of the largest capital investments of any of the Bitcoin actors, prefer short-term profits over long-term survivability and profits?

And parts of the first group vocally distrusts the majority of the second group and ridicules its own minority fractions, so there's some underlying intimidation potential which might prevent open approval for the minority groups, or at the very least push it off-channel. It's hard to judge, to be honest.
What is unclear is what the majority of the third group (economic actors like exchanges, etc.) thinks. Most of them seems to hedge their bets by waiting and seeing who wins, at which point they'll support the winner.
Besides, comparing relatively fresh development groups with the large incumbent isn't entirely fair. Compare to political parties:
Wannabe politicians who just don't want their efforts to go to waste usually join one of the powerful parties (not just in the west, but all over the world). But if the relative power would change, for whatever reason, a lot of people would also switch their "allegiances".
This happens all the time.
Thus, head count alone shouldn't be used as a proxy for what party has the *best* policies. It's a sign of power, more than anything else. Power begets power - or network effect as some would call it, and often simply because of a first-mover advantage.
I would not be surprised if the same were to happen in Bitcoin development too, if *somehow*, the balance of power were to shift. That's just common sense to expect, don't you think?

That applies for most soft forks (e.g. a theoretical SF that restricted max block size to 0.5 MB), but it doesn't hold for the SW SF.
SW SF introduces a new way of validating a transaction (HF-ish), wrapped in an anyone-can-spend script (while at the same time restricting (SF-ish) these txs to anyone-cannot-really-spend-anymore).

As far as I can tell, I only offered *you* a possible explanation to your question.

I came in from the sideline to suggest: "[was] probably [getting that idea from] the OP of this subthread mentioning [the vast majority of Core nodes], [which could] possibly [imply that the number of nodes had] significance?"
(I resolved references and added some text in brackets to make the context of my answer clearer.

True, but that only happens if the mempool limit was reached afterwards, so that some txs were evicted.
So when [Tradeblock]( shows that there were 40k transactions in their mempool 6 days ago and less than 5k in all likelyhood that means that there were enough memory for the transactions in the first place (and that they had enough fees to not be rejected outright), but that they've been accepted into blocks during the past 6 days.

29480 satoshis for a 2507 byte transaction = 11.76 sats/byte
According to [this]( page, the confirmation time for that kind of fee is currently in the 5 to 56 blocks range (yeah, quite wide range). If new transactions with 12 or more satoshis per byte keep pouring in, in theory it could go unconfirmed for ever.

In a regular SF, the minority's blocks will be orphaned whenever they produce blocks that fail to respect the new rules, right? How can they just continue doing their own thing then?

Good analogy, actually!
But considering that both subgroups of the original pack/troop have roadmaps for *changes* they'd like to do, and they both agree that things cannot go on as it is, I think it would be more genuinely described as an argument over which path to take at a crossroads. Neither will be going straight ahead anyway, so a discussion about who "breaks out" into their own pack is just semantics.
Considering their legacy, and how they would honor badges earned until the split, both have a legitimate claim to call themselves Troop 329. And until they've actually started walking down separate roads (i.e. before chains diverge), the analogy with packs of the same troop is apt.
Right now they're at the stage where they're walking towards the crossroads. They know it's there, but they don't know exactly how long it'll take to get there. It depends a great deal on how much each of the members drag their feet.
When they do part ways, though, it'll be hard to say who has the better claim to the troop's name/number. In most cases in the real world, it would be determined by a head count (unless resolved internally, like ETH/ETC, ofc) - and the minority would have to accept others calling them by a different name, even if they themselves felt it was unfair (this has happened to a LOT of organisations over the eons, particularly, but not restricted to, religious ones). In the digital world, head counts aren't that easy.
Approaching the head count problem by proof of work is one "techy" ways to go about it (i.e. whatever group does the most work is most likely to be the largest one), but ultimately the definition of a word like "Bitcoin" is a social process, just like for any other word.
Most likely, it'll be confusing for a short while until the dust clears, at least for outsiders. And eventually whoever has the majority of economic value/activity will most likely "win" the Bitcoin-naming debate in the eye of the masses.
If the ETF gets approved, it's tied itself to the highest hash rate, so that's at least one heavy-weight "opinion" in favor of the using the proof of work-resolution (aka Nakamoto consensus) described above.
@_date: 2017-03-07 00:41:44










Not if they implement some kind of merged mining which is backwards compatible with the minority chain - which could ironically be a soft fork. I hope they hold themselves above that, though.

Isn't this (that the minority cannot continue their own chain) literally the reason SFs are heralded as better/safer than HFs in the first place?
@_date: 2017-03-08 07:06:50


Nope, the block size (which is part of the block metadata) would make your node reject it and not even attempt to download it from others (besides you'd likely already have all the txs it consisted of due to being a full node listening for txs on the network anyway).


If a small miner cannot download all the txs, then he cannot possibly find the ones with highest fee (which he'd want to include in his blocks).
Besides, if a miner cannot afford the bandwidth cost, which is minimal - really minuscule - compared to his electricity costs, something is way off in his business model and the rest of the network shouldn't be designed around special circumstances like this, imho.
Also, it cannot be prevented. If the rest of the ecosystem coordinates to go to 4 MB, and for some reason some small miner cannot handle that, he won't be able to stop them regardless of what software he's running. He could be running Core or BU at 2 MB or original Classic, and it wouldn't matter either way.


Yes, but I don't see how it can be prevented.


Then a chain split happens. What you must consider is how likely this (in my opinion, contrived) scenario is. Who would gain anything by forcing a split if half the economic ecosystem (which is what I assume you mean - node count itself can't be used for anything) were signalling that they wouldn't go along with it? My take: Everyone would lose, which is why it won't happen in that scenario.
And as Johnson Lau [says on the bitcoin-dev mailing list]( "Split prevention is a social problem, not a technical one."
@_date: 2017-03-07 04:07:44
I know what you mean, but I wouldn't say people are the "problem". AI agents would have the same problems coordinating, given different incentives.
The "problem", as you allude to, is the inherent economic and social challenge of judging the future, what's best for oneself and the group, both short-term and long-term, what matters, who gets to decide, and so on and so forth.
Unless this is accepted as a premise and seen for the huge challenge it is, I don't see that we'll progress very far. As long as people pretend Bitcoin *development* is "unpolitical", "technical", "fundamentally X or Y or Z", we won't get anywhere.
Sure, Bitcoin-the-protocol doesn't care about the human world. But Bitcoin-the-development-process is deeply rooted in it.
@_date: 2017-03-07 01:44:03
Exactly, it's a symbiosis.
Similarly users have a large disincentive to say bye-bye to the miners too. If they did, they'd simultaneously be saying goodbye to a large portion of the security of their chain, along with a good chunch of the network effect (depending on how large the subset of users was) and arguably value of their commodity/currency (which has an opportunity cost even if you think it'll recover).
To sum up:
\- I see no good economic reason why users would be doing a UASF or why they should reject non-foundational changes to Bitcoin.
\- I see no good economic reason why miners would completely disregard the opinions, wishes and needs of the other actors in the ecosystem (both individuals and corporations).
@_date: 2017-03-07 03:04:30
I'd agree that it's worthwhile to discuss if we agree that it's a hypothetical scenario and mostly for exploring/testing the soundness of Bitcoin's incentives (which may or may not break as the subsidy goes down, I'll grant that).
But to bring it up as some kind of indirect argument for why we should not stick with the highest hash rate today? Well, that's just silly.
@_date: 2017-03-24 21:57:17

@_date: 2017-03-08 22:25:21


Right. And I agree with your examples.
So, given that validity changes over time: By what process does the meaning "Bitcoin" transition from one set of validity rules to another?


How can you say that there's only one set of consensus rules when there's clearly lots of BU nodes out there accepting larger blocks today?
@_date: 2017-03-08 23:43:28


You're describing a scenario where miners have started mining 3 MB blocks while you have chosen to "stay behind" at 2 MB. That's a fair choice, but it means either:
\- You're a loner (or part of a tiny economic minority), not caring about the rules of the rest of the network. The rest of the world will ignore you like nothing happened. This has nothing to do with the client software you're running, and the situation would be exactly the same if you were running a client with a hard-coded limit of 2 MB.
\- There's been a chain split and there's two different Bitcoins, both with legitimate economic activity and different currencies. Kinda like the ETH/ETC split, only in Bitcoin terms; let's call them BTC1 and BTC2. My estimate is that this is an unlikely scenario, but that's just my opinion. Either way, if you only accept value in BTC1, you should tell your payers about that so that they avoid sending you BTC2 txs. And a legitimate economic split of the ecosystem has nothing to do with what client software you run.


Nope. The hard (i.e. costly) part of validating a block is validating the txs, which in some cases can have quite complex [scripts]( After tx validation is done, making sure the block header is valid is done at next to no cost (as in *many* orders of magnitude simpler than tx validation).


Sup with the hostility? If you have other data or experience which shows that bandwidth cost is a factor for miners, please show me.
Either way, stop using what you think about me as an "argument", because it's not. I'm pretty sure that "argument from assumption of lack of authority" is a fallacy. ;)


You're saying this as if it was solvable by code. It's not. What you're describing is a social/economic challenge, not a bullet that can be dodged by running a certain client.


BU is all about signalling. It allows miners to signal PoW-based signals in the coinbase and it allows nodes to signal (and enforce!) block size and other acceptance parameters.
Contrast that with the complete lack of ways for a Core node to signal that it would prefer an upgrade to 2 MB even as it enforces a 1 MB limit along the way.
What BU doesn't have is hard-coded activation limits (like segwit's 95 %), due to the realization that consensus for new rules - particularly, but not restricted to, hard forks like blocksize increases - is fundamentally a human process.


Of course there would be a grace period. If you honestly want to learn how this would work, [here]( a suggested process straight from the horse's mouth.


I'm sure the process would take a lot longer than a week, so that seems like hyperbole to me. But even if we go with your contrived situation: If you couldn't find time during a full week to change the number "1" to "2" in your node's UI, then you probably wouldn't have a lot of economic activity going on. This is a complete non-issue for the network.

Which would be a so-called "evil SF"?
@_date: 2017-03-08 01:50:58

@_date: 2017-03-09 00:09:25
Right, I didn't catch the nuance of you saying "grown over time" instead of "changed over time" the first time I saw it.
But now I see that you think that SFs are allowable, but any HF would end up as... an alt-coin?
Thought experiment: What if the majority (of miners, economy, nodes and users) at some point in the future end up adopting a HF and go on calling it Bitcoin (because, why wouldn't they, if they were the majority)?
@_date: 2017-03-07 06:13:54


But not everyone has to run the same client, so that only leads us back to my question again. What's the difference between setting your own acceptable blocksize by running a hard-coded client or voting by running a configurable client? Would be nice if you could give a straight answer. :)


That's not answering my question and it sounds like you know the answer anyway. Are you saying that the algorithmic migration from 1 to 2 MB is the real reason why you'd chose original Classic over BU?

No, I don't, but I don't believe technical-ness is what we're talking about here. It's about familiarity with terms.
I do believe a higher fraction of smartphone buyers would be familiar with "gigabyte", and thus understand the marketing message, than miners would understand "subsidy" to mean "the non-fee part of the coinbase value" as opposed to "subsidy in addition to the coinbase value".
Your case isn't helped by Bitcoin ecosystem developers also using the term "Block Reward" (case in point: [blockchain(.info?)]( and I'm sure I could find others, but somehow I don't think that's going to change your stance.
Besides, marketing for a lot of products should really be selling gibibytes, not gigabytes, if technical correctness was important. But I don't expect that to happen anytime soon. Do you?

It's not a fact, so please stop saying that. "Are you disputing this?" would've done, while adding "fact" at the end just shows that you're not open to being wrong. It does not paint you in a good light.
Yes, I'm disputing it.
I'm saying Core would've generated different hashes, which would have resulted in 0 or more blocks found, but we cannot know what that number would've been.
The reason different hashes would've been generated is because Core wouldn't have stuffed so many transactions into the block that it went over the 1 MB limit. And the value of the solution hash depends (among other things) on what txs are included in the block.
Swap a single tx out or in of a candidate block, and the block's hash would be something completely different. Swap a single bit in one of the txs, and the same would happen. That's a fundamental property of SHA-256 - or any cryptographically secure hashing algorithm for that matter.
Are we getting somewhere, now? :)

So the onus is on the minority to fork away from the "majority bullies"? Sounds like a UASF.


Sounds like that line of reasoning could be applied to the BU situation and the would-be orphaned minority as well.


Good to hear. It's not black and white and I'm struggling with finding my own position, to be honest. Which is why I like challenging people who've put a lot of thought into it. :)
I think the central question is the one you didn't answer from my previous post: At what point does the goal (not splitting the chain) not justify the means (SF-orphaning) any more?
...and I believe different people will have different answers to that one, currently heavily influenced by the concrete situation we have at hand and what "party" they support. I'm not so sure the answers will be generalizable, though. :(

Good point. They seem very risk averse, though. "If it works, don't fix it"-style. If the fees continue rising, the economic incentive will get to them eventually, though. Just as Bitcoin is supposed to work. ;)

Very well put. What determines validity?
@_date: 2017-03-08 05:56:59


Really? This is all kinds of curious. Honestly not sure if I should laugh or cry.
The question was clearly stated 1) in my first post of this conversation and 2) then re-quoted in the post you were now answering.
I'll now try quoting it once more, with some [additional text] to explain the context which has surely been lost by now:
"Is there any reason not to [move the witness commitment], if at first [segwit] was going to be bundled with a 2 MB MAX_BLOCKSIZE hardfork? [which is what I believe the poster you replied to meant to suggest]"


No, that wasn't the question.


I mean, thanks for the effort of those paragraphs, but that's a road I explicitly asked you not go down in the first post:
"(I'm not looking for an argument over hard fork risks here, I'm just trying to read his comment in the spirit I believe it was meant.)"
@_date: 2017-03-07 09:16:02
Thanks a lot! &lt;3
@_date: 2017-03-08 02:29:26


They sure did, yet that has no effect on what they lost.


Myself, thank you. From understanding the code.


They didn't lose that reward due to the fact that they wouldn't have constructed that block in the first place if they ran non-buggy software. As a simple lay-man explanation, it works pretty well, though. And you need to understand how hashing works to see that it's not true.


Other miners? Not even the *node* that found the block considered it valid. :D (Yet, some other miners did try to build upon it for a few seconds due to the headers-first approach they use.)


BU's fault, true. Invalid block, true. Correct solution... Uh, that depends what you mean. This solution (i.e. hash) were below the target, so as a pure proof-of-work token, it would've been enough. I guess that's what you're getting at?
My point is that if they ran non-bugged software, it would never have created this hash in the first place (we know that due to the fact that SHA256 collisions doesn't happen just like that).
We can, however, reason about what would've happened in an alternative reality where BU didn't have the bug: It would've been working at a different tx set, producing entirely different hashes (i.e. attempts at finding solutions).
There's a chance it would've found a solution (albeit a different one) even when working at this different tx set. If so, if would've happened at a different point in time and with a different block/tx set. Heck, it may even have found several blocks. Does that mean they lost several block rewards? It's basically about chance/randomness, and we'll never know.


Whoa, man, hold your horses. I'm giving you facts here, but you sure don't seem willing to do consider what I'm saying.


Where have I demonstrated that I don't understand mining?


No, I was only trying to match your hostile attitude from the previous post. Let's try a different approach this time and see if that changes anything. :)


I don't. I suggest you calm down and re-read my previous post when you're in a more positive mood. Perhaps we'll find some common ground, eventually. :)
@_date: 2016-01-28 23:29:20
Hi Jonas, and thanks for the follow-up. :)


Sure, that's basic math, but that only gives us the answer for a given point in time. If block size was doubled tomorrow, that would instantly halve the kWh per transaction figure, right?
This leads to the part I don't understand: What's the point of calculating this figure (i.e. kWh-cost per tx) in the first place when it is really the properties of the blocks (difficulty, size, propagation speed/orphan rate, etc.) that matter?

That's a really contrived scenario, at least in the current climate. And likely forever. Why would holders, and I mean all of them, ever accept their bitcoins being devalued when one of the foundational principles behind Bitcoin is that the monetary supply has a fixed cap?
And there's an endless number of these scenarios you can come up with... Like - what if the highest hashrate decided to adjust the difficulty targeting so that blocks are found every second? "Like, are we just gonna accept that?" Well, no, of course not. And the miners know that. So there's no incentive for them to even consider it. Just as messing with the 21 mill coin cap.
@_date: 2017-03-07 02:28:28


Not sure if he's aware of the technical details he's asking for, but it *could* be moving the witness commitment from coinbase to block header?
Is there any reason not to, if at first it was going to be bundled with a 2 MB MAX_BLOCKSIZE hardfork (which is the context is which his segwit comment was written)?
(I'm not looking for an argument over hard fork risks here, I'm just trying to read his comment in the spirit I believe it was meant.)
@_date: 2017-03-08 22:53:27


No, it's not semantics, it has real world implications, both for judging who lost and how much was lost - and for the future.
One of the implications that I haven't mentioned yet is that all the other BU 1.0 miners *also* lost opportunities of finding real blocks in exactly the same way that the one that found an invalid block did.
If they had been mining with Core, for example, they could've found blocks during the time they were actually working on invalid blocks. This is the opportunity cost I talked about earlier.
What is lost, apparently, on you, is the complex nature of mining.
If you continue calling people morons for trying to teach you things, instead of admitting that your learned something, and possibly even thanking them for the effort, you won't get far. This does really not reflect well on you and even if you're too proud to admit it in this conversation, you should take a look at what we've both been writing since the start and reevaluate how you approach these things next time.
May life treat you as pleasantly as you are. Good evening.

Glad to hear!


Good question(s)! My "answer" to both is that it depends on your definition of an apple. That's one of the reasons definitions are so hard to get right - and mostly morph or break down over time anyway (mind you, I'm not saying they're futile). ;)
I think there's a meaningful difference between evolutionary and destructive changes, though. So, what do I mean by that?
Evolutionary changes are gradual changes (i.e. changes that take time and may be hard to notice at smaller time-scales) and leave the subject mostly intact, yet changed - for better or worse (sometimes it's hard to tell without hindsight).
Destructive changes are comparatively quick and consist of changes that the subject isn't fit to incorporate/handle/adapt to (exactly what this means depends on what the subject is and would be quite different from inanimate objects to living organisms to immaterial concepts, etc.).
When you're eating the apple, you're making destructive changes to it and if you keep it up until it's gone, at some point it will cease to be an apple. Exactly where the line is drawn is subjective and depends on what apple definition you would subscribe to, as mentioned above.
The Ship of Theseus story describes an evolutionary change and in my opinion this is a clear *indication* (not *conclusion*, as that would require greater consensus) that it's still Theseus at the end of the journey, but I accept that it's possible to take a different stance on this.


Yeah, it was too long for me to read in full at the time, and the way you introduced it seemed like you had extracted the important part already (the definition) - so I decided to submit my post, before leaving for another commitment. I have now read the second link too and see that some of my previous questions were already answered there.
Additionally, it seems that you subscribe to exactly the same "gray-scale" evaluation approach (or whatever it should be called) that I do. I often tend to describe evolutionary changes in the semantics of words as a social process, at which many "purists" laugh... 'because words have definitions and if you use them incorrectly, you're simply wrong'. Yeah, right.
In fact, I think you might recognize some of the same ideas expressed in [this]( post that I wrote yesterday? (I included the two parent posts to get the context right.)
If I knew you in real life, I'm pretty sure we'd be philosophy bros. :D Keep up the good and thoughtful explanations. The world should have a lot more exposure to people who are able to express ideas on other scales than the black-and-white. Again, wheelbarrows of kudos-stuff to you!

@_date: 2017-03-08 05:48:37


I'm pretty sure that's exactly the control BU was designed to give. Remember, "Unlimited" stands for unlimited choice (a break away from centrally planned block sizes), not unlimited blocksize.
You can set the size you want to accept at 2 MB and leave it at that forever - or change it when you feel it's time.
In case of a chain split and you want to give your node the ability to "go with the flow", so to speak, even if it breaks your limit, you can tell it to accept an even larger size in if the larger chain gets X blocks ahead.
(If you don't want this, just set the number of blocks to 9999999999 and that would mirror the behavior of hard-coded clients like Core and original Classic.)


I agree, but that has nothing to do with us running BU or Core.


Miners can control the size of the block they produce themselves, but they can't force anyone else to accept them, neither smaller miners, nor nodes.




BU relies on all parts of the ecosystem coordinating in the real word before activating changes, just as they are doing today. Through all kinds of conferences, consensus meetings with devs and whatnot.
Miners have good economic reasons not to force bigger blocks on the rest of the ecosystem. If fact, many seem to be worried that today's small blocksizes are exactly what miners want (to push fees up). (I don't believe so, but that's another story.)
Hope I've managed to clear up a few things. ;)
@_date: 2017-03-07 19:27:54


Thanks for the clarification. That's a consistent position to take, at least so far. I believe I did wrongly assume that you subscribed to the "purist" approach that some folks around these parts do, where any non-backwards compatible change is automatically deemed an altcoin regardless of the outcome of the social and economic process of forming consensus around modifications. Mea culpa.
Follow-up questions: How many people would there need to be to fulfill the "people use" clause (either as a number or a fraction of the whole)? Is it possible that two systems could simultaneously fall under your definition at the same time (cf. ETH/ETC, which both are "in use" by "people" and have the same ancestry)?


Sure. The "work" of a single block is determined by the difficulty which was in effect at the block height at which it was found. Two candidate blocks at the same height of the same chain is always deemed to have same amount of work, regardless of the actual integer value of the hash/solution that was found.
Sounds like you're familiar enough with the system to understand what I'm saying, but if you prefer a less "techy" explanation, just ask. :)
Btw, that's why the whitepaper talks about attacking *chains*, not *blocks*.
(Pre-post "edit": Doh, in the first link you provided explained exactly this, so you learned it already 2 hrs ago and already updated your thought experiment. Seems like I have nothing of value to add to your discussion, at least not in this subthread, so let's stick to the questions regarding your Bitcoin definition. ;))
@_date: 2017-03-08 04:35:21
Nope. Although some of the rules are alluded to, there's nowhere near a full set of consensus rules in there. For example, it doesn't conclude what hashing algorithm should be used, it doesn't define the scripting language and tx format, it says nothing about block size, bitcoin issuance rate (which leads to the ~21 mill cap), etc.
Have you read it, btw? It's brilliant! :)

I have. And I *was* trying to be clever. I do believe I succeeded. Or perhaps it's just humor that's bad. :P


Yeah, and my point was that not everything is at it seems. At least not always. Pretty simple point, no? And fully laid out in my very first sentence in the first post to you.
Besides, I've not seen much blocksize increase enthusiasm from Core either, although there are some exceptions. There are also exceptions the other way - who seem very enthusiastic about decreasing the blocksize.


I'm glad to hear that that was your intent, but I'm used to judging three consecutive question marks, combined with strong assertions like "Miners are the only small blockers left." as signs of immaturity.
Yes, it was somewhat prejudicial of me, but there's years of heuristics discovery behind it. I also did take a look at your post history and seemed to find the same attitude there. If you show that I was mistaken, I will apologize.


True dat, but it wasn't *that* bad, was it? Saying "I'm not sure you're worth my time" isn't as hostile as concluding "You're not worth my time". It was my honest first impression of you, fwiw.
People obviously don't always like to hear that stuff up front and I fully understand if you think I'm a prick by now, but after the aggressive attitude you showed in the first post, I simply didn't care much about having a conversation with you.
Sometimes, assertive people need to hear from someone who doesn't respect their brutish strategies. I think it's good for both parties, actually.
I'll admit I was brushing you off, but only because of the way you opened your post, not because that's how I generally treat people (and I think you'll find that to be true if you look at my history).


I wouldn't call it nothing, but I agree my reply wasn't exactly warranted. And I really think you should be more humble about concluding what your style provokes at the other end. (I honestly mean that as a tip, but I can't force you not to judge it as another ad-hominem. ;))


We all are, trust me. Some of us try to stay civil regardless, but sometimes it slips. Like when we are confronted with short, shouting posts ("What???") and posters who are seemingly unwilling to consider more than one position. Like your first post.
As humans I think we need these outbursts now and then, to feel that we don't drown in crap without doing anything about it - and this time the bubble burst at your post. Mea culpa.


See, now you're jumping to conclusions again. Please stop that.
How can you say that my [first post]( in this thread isn't about having a productive conversation? Or [this]( thread?
I *am* here to have productive conversations, but good interlocutors are hard to find. Your post bore literally none of the signs of a productive conversation, so I was very happy to end it then and there.


Uh, wtf? See, this is what I'm talking about. Someone slights you and you go *full* ad-hominem. That's pretty much what I expected from the question marks in your first post. Please don't prove my gut instinct to be right.


I don't need your mercy. Probably, no-one does.


Are you saying that that is what I'm doing, or are you talking in general now. It's really hard to tell, but if it's the former, you just went full retard.


No offense taken. No arguments destroyed (what does that even mean... are you sure you're... like... a grown-up... or something?).


Nope, but I'm getting quite perplexed. What's up with the need to project your own emotions to me? And if you really thought all this that you're writing about my character, why would you spend all that time writing this rage post?


Premature conclusion. Also concluding about other people's intents, which you cannot possibly know. If I were you I'd go for "you don't seem to want to have a real discussion", which would be entirely fair to say as it only expresses your own thoughts about the idiot you're conversing with.


That's demonstrably false, from pretty much every conversation I've ever had on reddit (with a few exceptions, this one probably counting as one, but I'm not entirely sure if I should be blamed for the level you're escalating it to), so you're apparently relying your own emotions over doing any real background checking, even if it's only a click away.


Nope, I told you straight to your face what my first impression of your post was. What's sullen about that?
I think the problem here is that you didn't like what I wrote. Perhaps I should have been more diplomatic or gentle, but I'm pretty sure I couldn't have been more active (as opposed to passive) without getting even more flak from you for it.


I never said you started any hostility, but accusations of passive-aggressive ad-hominem hostility (if that's even possible) sure seems to be your shtick. Sup with that?
What I will say, however, is that you've got a lot of explaining to do. Mostly to yourself, though, because the world generally ignores bigotry. Enjoy your evening, if you can. :)
@_date: 2017-03-07 01:37:58
Are you saying it wouldn't *work* or that they wouldn't dare to do it because it would affect SPV wallets?
I agree with you it's not likely that they'll do it, and I hope they don't, but I'm pretty sure the highest hashrate chain *could* implement changes to give a "difficulty rebate" to those who mine empty blocks in the minority chain. Perhaps merged mining isn't the right term.

I understand he's eager to lift the blocksize restriction, but I don't think 60 % is safe.
I do think there's a difference between saying "need to get to 60 or 70 percent" (which basically shows that he's not certain exactly what the threshold should be) and "we're going for a fork at 60%", which is what said.
I strongly doubt that he'll try to overrule miners anyway (how could he?) and I'm pretty sure they won't do anything until ~75 % majority.

This is a fallacy. It's pretty much like the Bitcoin detractors saying "Name a single government that accepts tax payments in bitcoins. I'm expecting only crickets.". Which is also a really bad argument, btw.

@_date: 2017-03-07 18:47:05
Let's do a thought experiment to see if you are really committed to your definition. Suppose someone ran a Bitcoin client continuously since january 2009 and at some point the majority took a different path than your own client (i.e. created a chain that was invalid to your client). You're still running and possibly trying to mine on your own chain, but eventually you find yourself completely adandoned. According to your definition this single-user legacy client/chain is the real Bitcoin, and the rest of the world is using an alt coin. Do you think that is correct?


Yeah, that's not possible. Why does your thought experiment include contradictions like this? Please update to something that makes sense.
@_date: 2017-03-14 21:51:28

Nope, it's a really bad argument. Bitcoin really is a "highest [honest] hashrate decides everything" system, but it's not MERELY that. Far from it.
It also has social and (perhaps most importantly) economic incentives in place ensuring that the hashrate doesn't do silly stuff that the community wouldn't accept, which includes messing with the 21 mill limit among a whole lot of other things. The *combination* of the technology and the underpinning economic incentives IS Bitcoin's innovation.
Have you read the white paper, btw? It explained how these things fit together to produce a working *system* out of parts that by themselves do nothing (like hashpower in itself - that's pretty much worthless). ;)

Then you don't understand how mining works, or haven't thought the situation through. Pick one. That's a fact.
They did not lose that particular 13.2 BTC block reward because there's no way they could've used that "solution" for a valid block. (Finding an *actually* valid solution would imply working at a different tx set, which would have turned out completely different hashes all the way).
They only lost the opportunity cost of not hashing towards a valid block whenever they were working with a tx set that would result in a block of above 1 MB size (of which there must've been many permutations - all the way back from the day they installed BU 1.0 and until the day it was fixed), which can only be calculated probabilistically.
Just because "they lost a block reward" is a simple way to make sense of the situation for non-technical people, doesn't make it fact.


...and everyone who seriously works with security would laugh their asses off at such a claim.


I'm aware that there were a quite a few. May even have been more, tbh, but I was never a segwit developer so the exact number has never been important to me. Are you saying that the number of testnets is a good security metric? This is a bit cringeworthy, tbh. ;)


Now, that's a blanket statement which I believe few "pros" would make. Security is always subject to a cost-benefit analysis. There's no such thing as 100 % secure, etc. Any security pro will tell you this.
Now, I'll grant you that code review and trying to prevent bugs in production code is *much* more important in Bitcoin than in most other projects, but I don't see how you go from there to asserting that it couldn't happen to Core.


Well, that is an inherent challenge for the economic incentives underlying Bitcoin regardless of BU's existence. Any changes require that the ecosystem accepts them and BU is just *one* way to facilitate signalling willingness to accept certain changes.
I could agree that it makes certain attack vectors somewhat easier, by priming actors to expect changes to the consensus rules, but it's not like BU creates these vectors from thin air.
I'd rather say that protocol changes have a complex economic/social process around them regardless of whether the signalling happens in-channel, BU-style, or off-channel, IRC/forum/conference/agreements/meetings-style.

Two problems with websites:
\* If you get malware/viruses on your computer, they could take over control of your wallet (e.g. by logging your credentials, hijacking after you've logged in, etc.).
\* If the website/service/exchange goes out of business, decides to scam you or get infected with malware/virus on *their* end, the same could happen.
Of course, controlling the keys to your own software wallet is also hard security-wise, which is why the general recommendation for large values of coins is to get a hardware wallet (which takes care of the malware/virus/keylogging/hi-jacking situation while providing a generally user-friendly interface).
If you have tons of altcoins, finding a hardware wallet that supports all may not be easy. Then you'll just have to consider what the best risk/cost/work vs. security is. Making that tradeoff decision isn't always easy. ;)

My entry point was when someone said "[Satoshi] is describing a payment channel", directly referencing the OP's Satoshi quote, which I felt was misusing that quote.


True, I agree.


Thank you, I had forgotten exactly how that worked. So, the presigned tx that is part of setting up (the anti-fraud mechanism for) the channel will be invalid if the tx it references is malleated before it confirms on the chain. Makes perfect sense now. :)

Depends on what script the 3-address actually represents, but if it was a Segwit script then the answer is probably yes. I amended my answer, above.

@_date: 2017-08-09 04:11:38
Ok, I've done some more research and have a plan (hope I've not overlooked anything... finding good Litecoin documentation is bloody hard).
Gotta sleep a bit now, but I'll be back with a guide asap, hopefully tomorrow. It won't be possible to fully resolve this until Segwit is activated anyway, in like 2 weeks' time, so you'll have to be patient for a while. ;)


I haven't used Electrum, but I tried it now and couldn't find a way to get it to deal with Segwit addresses.
It seems like most BTC wallets don't expose Segwit functionality to users yet (can't blame them since Segwit isn't active, so generating Segwit addresses in BTC wallets would just have been an invitation for people to send their money down a black hole).


Yes, but that should be handled automatically by the wallet. We're basically counting on Bitcoin and Litecoin having the same default redeemscript for P2SH (pay to script hash, i.e. the addresses starting with '3' or 'M') wrapped P2WPKH (pay to witness pubkeyhash) addresses, which is what would make them use the exact same address (and thus make the BTC spendable even if they were sent to an address generated for LTC).
I'll get back to you with some steps you can take ahead of Segwit activation to make sure you have retrieved the correct private key. See you around. :)

Their histories won't be different, only their futures (after the fork). And in practice there would only be a real chain fork if miners stayed behind and worked on the "old" 5 % (or lower) chain after they diverged.
That's the same as for any fork, by the way, soft forks included. But why would they do that if there's 95 % (or more) support for the new one? There's huge economic and social disincentives for doing this, which is one of the reasons why previous forks haven't really created two separate and enduring ledgers.
In order to end up with two different ledgers in practice (both for soft and hard forks), the split must be willfully pursued by both parties, e.g. like with the ETH/ETC split in Ethereum.

Yes, if the BTC was in the "segwit" address at the time of the split (~Aug 1st), the BCH that popped into existence at the same address won't be spendable (since the redeem script that corresponds to that address isn't valid on chains that doesn't support segwit). :(

There's 5 different answers in the few posts I've read in this thread alone:
1) Latency of blocks will go up linearly (which clearly is bogus, btw).
2) The 2x proposal isn't bad by itself, but it hasn't followed the right process.
3) We should wait and see what base block demand there is after SW and LN has been deployed and is running at full speed (i.e. full adoption) - and no, we don't know when that will be.
4) 2x base block size will also double SW's max weight so that attackers can create 8 MB blocks while the network can only handle 4 MB blocks (presumably suffixed by: and we don't want to keep max weight at 4 MB while increasing base block size because reasons).
5) Contentious™ changes just *can not* be allowed to happen.
I'm pretty sure you won't get the various respondents to agree on which of the above points are important, though. It's almost like the conclusion has been drawn first, and then the rationale is being created afterwards, with [various results]( But what do I know...

Why not gauge its contentiousness the same way that recent soft forks are being rolled out, i.e. stage 1 of [this post](


Do you think a so-called "soft-hardfork" (a hard fork wrapped in a soft fork), instead of a straight up hard fork, would ease their minds?

[Here]( But don't do it on a computer that touches the internet. And why would you need to fiddle with your key directly anyway? That's what wallets do for you.
@_date: 2017-01-15 23:34:13


Then why not wrap the hard fork in a soft fork (aka "soft-hardfork", "firm fork" or whatever)?
Stage 1 - the soft fork: Use a soft-fork activation mechanism (BIP9?) which says that after X % support the fork, the fork is "locked in" and a transitional period starts. After that period, all non-supporting blocks are rejected (thus forcing everyone into "consensus", soft fork style).
Stage 2 - the hard fork: A certain time after the soft fork activates (in practice estimated by a number of blocks, Y), the hard fork goes into effect, in practice setting the max blocksize at some algorithmic or fixed size Z, e.g. 2 MB or whatever.
Wouldn't this essentially give a similar upgrade trajectory as that of a soft fork? If so, we could perhaps advance beyond the soft vs. hard fork discussion and get back to the actual blocksize/scaling discussion which has been smothered "lately"?

So, this is the jump I don't follow/agree with. You seem to say that any temporary prevention of spending is a payment channel. I think that's too broad for a definition, as [explained in the other fork of this thread](
Thank you also for the references to Yours and LN. I see, and agree, that the nlocktime (or the newer relative locktime) is a building block of payment channels, and as such a necessary, but not by itself sufficient, part of them.
It all comes down to definitions/semantics, I guess.
@_date: 2017-08-08 12:03:11
For example BCH's soft fork which adds a new rule/restiction (i.e. a soft fork) which prevents miners from including regular Bitcoin txs on the BCH chain.
Also, BCH txs have to adhere to a new rule/restriction (i.e. another soft fork) requiring a new flag (in the tx headers?) to be set, which the "old" clients simply don't know how to make. This is how it's being described on BCH's home page (although I haven't researched the details):

Assumption 1: One chain will always have better profitability than the other due to market movements, regardless of diff. adjustment algorithm.
Assumption 2: (Some portion of) miners will always follow the money.
Question: How could such oscillations be prevented, even theoretically? (Peg the currencies to each other? /s)
@_date: 2017-08-03 12:59:33
BCH block  *was* found within 45 mins of my post, so now there doesn't seem to be any more likely difficulty drops in the near future.
And as long as miners keep "charity mining" (i.e. mining BCH even if it's less profitable than BTC) at the level they do now, 6 blocks won't take 12 hrs to find and we won't see any more drops.
Yeah, it's interesting to see how this all plays out. I'm a bit disappointed that we didn't get to see the market dynamics of a situation where BCH was more profitable than BTC, because that would've been really interesting to watch. :D

The Powers That Be?
@_date: 2017-08-10 03:43:40
Ok, so the overall plan is to a) find and verify that you've got the right key, b) convert it to Bitcoin format and import it into a segwit-supporting Bitcoin wallet and c) wait for the funds to be spendable. Sounds easy, right? Well, perhaps not.
a) and b) can be done right away, so let's get started:
[Find the right address]( in your Trezor Litecoin wallet:
\- Choose Litecoin ( chose account ( click "Receive" (
\- Find and copy the M-address ( Example: `MWdtJrjsfeyGBuCVxAx7N4gKsmFShViS1M`
\- Note down the BIP32 derivation path ( Example: `m/49'/2'/0'/0/5` (the apostrophes are important!)
\- Go to the [address converter]( (
\- [Convert the M-address to a 3-address]( and copy it. Example: `3QRjzyKuiY7qPPvbrHxmYRRvZ4eznfF3Jb`. This *must* match the 3-address that your money were sent to, or you've got the wrong one.
\- Go to some Bitcoin blockchain explorer and check the 3-address. [Verify that it has the money you expect]( If not, repeat the steps above until you've found the right one. ;)
By the way, the reason Litecoin has [converted from using 3-addresses to using M-addresses]( is to avoid exactly the problem you're having right now.
Get the private key for the 3/M-address (both have the same private key, it's just a different encoding of the same data):
\- Go to your *offline* version of the [BIP39]( page
\- Type in the BIP39 mnemonic - aka "Trezor recovery seed" ( your passphrase - if you have one ( choose "LTC - Litecoin" ( and BIP32 derivation path ( as [shown here](
\- Now, for the part that requires preciseness: Type in the first four segments of the BIP32 derivation path ( [from the Trezor Litecoin wallet], but not the fifth one (we'll find that further down on the page). Example: `m/49'/2'/0'/0`.
Note that it starts with `49'`, not `44'` (which I used as an example in my first post yesterday) due to the fact that the BIP32 derivation path for segwit addresses are somewhat different than ordinary addresses, cf. [BIP49](
\- Scroll down 'till you find the address index that matches the last segment in the BIP32 derivation path such that the path shown on the left ( is *exactly* the same as the one you noted down from the Trezor Litecoin wallet.
\- Record (and keep safe!) the corresponding Litecoin private key (
Now, without changing anything else, change the Coin selection to Bitcoin, [as shown in ( here](
\- Scroll down to the correct address path again ( and record (and keep safe!) the corresponding Bitcoin private key (
Note that the Litecoin and Bitcoin private keys you've now found really represent the same private key (i.e. the same large number that *is* the private key), they're just *encoded* with a different [base58check]( prefix so that software can easily see what kind of coin this key is *intended* for.
Obviously, in your case, a key intended for Litecoin has been used on the Bitcoin network, which can be a bit of a hassle after-the-fact - but in normal circumstances this is supposed to *help* users prevent unintentional crossovers between currencies/chains.
Now that you have the private Bitcoin key, you could in theory lean back and wait 2 weeks for segwit activation on the Bitcoin network, but I figured we might as well use the time for something productive: Walking you through the process of importing the key, but using Litecoin Core (which runs on a network where segwit has activated) instead of Bitcoin Core.
This will ensure that you get some dry-run training on how to actually do it - as well as verifying that you've managed to all the steps above. So if you're still with me, here's a few more bullet points:
\- Install Litecoin Core and let it [sync up with the network]( This may take a while, depending on the beefyness of your internet connection and computer. (Mine took between 3 and 4 hours.)
\- When it's done syncing, [open the "Debug window"](
\- [Import the Litecoin private key]( like this: `importprivkey &lt;your-privkey-here&gt; "From Trezor" false`. The `false` at the end prevents it from scanning through the full Litecoin transaction history to see if you've received any funds (we already know you haven't - on the Litecoin network, anyway)
\- Now open the ["Receiving addresses" window]( and copy the L-address of the key we just imported (which you will recognize by the "From Trezor" label we gave it, above).
\- [Activate the corresponding segwit address]( like this: `addwitnessaddress &lt;your-L-address-here&gt;`. The wallet should respond with an M-address, which is the [P2SH-P2WPKH address]( representation of the redeemScript that we talked about yesterday (but that you don't really need to know anything about as long as the wallet handles it for you).
If the wallet responds with an error message saying `Segregated witness not enabled on network (code -4)`, it only means that it isn't done syncing (downloading/verifying) the blockchain all the way to the point were segwit was activated. Just wait until it's full synced and this should resolve itself. Incidentally, this is also what Bitcoin Core would tell you - and why you cannot really see your BTC in a wallet yet.
\- The final step is to make sure the M-address that was added (you'll find it in the ["Receiving addresses" window]( even after you've cleared/closed the "Debug window") [matches the M-address that we started with]( in the Trezor Litecoin wallet. If it does, it means the circle is complete and you've levelled up your crypto skills. Congratulations! :D
(Eventually, when you do the same steps in Bitcoin Core, it should give you a 3-address instead of M-address [remember M-addresses are just 3-addresses encoded with a Litecoin-specific prefix]. And this 3-address should be the one where your money resides.)
Epilogue: To prepare for doing the same steps in Bitcoin (but with the Bitcoin private key and Bitcoin Core instead), you may as well start early by installing Bitcoin Core and letting it sync up (it probably takes quite a bit longer than Litecoin!). Also, you *may* be able to do the same things in a lighter-weight wallet like Electrum, but I've really only used Core and Trezor, so I can't be of much help then. (I did try to find documentation for how to do this with Electrum, but couldn't find anything.)
Good luck! :)

Can you elaborate instead of just asserting it? I thought a payment channel required you to lock some funds into it.
@_date: 2017-08-03 02:24:13
In theory, rational miners should not mine at BCH chain at all until diff becomes so low that it gives more reward than BTC. Then a lot of hashing power should switch over, and there'll be a lot of fast blocks (unless price drops low enough to make reward too low again) until the next ordinary difficulty change. And then diff may go even further down, due to the last 2016 blocks (probably?) taking longer than 2 weeks to complete.

Doesn't mention exactly what is unethical, but it sounds like a variant of 2), above. Doesn't give a technical explanation of "why 2MB is bad".


Doesn't say what's lacking specification. This probably touches on aspects of 2), but is most likely a 6)'th item: "This particular implementation is badly coded / lacking documentation / has bugs / etc.". It doesn't really give a technical explanation of "why 2MB is bad" *as an idea*, though. It is more like nitpicking on the implementation, communication, etc. Which is why it's similar to number 2).


Depending on exactly what's absurd... no, *extremely absurd*... it could go under 2) or 3). It doesn't give a technical explanation of "why 2MB is bad", though.


Certainly number 2) again. And it doesn't give a technical explanation of "why 2MB is bad".


This lacks elaboration on *exactly what* negative impact it has on the viability of the system. This eludes to there being a clear technical reason, but it doesn't really mention or explain it. That's a pity, because this one showed such promise.


This is over in the philosophical/psychological/economic arguments related to number 5). It doesn't give a *technical* explanation of "why 2MB is bad", though.


This is simply a bit perplexing to me. They *would* have the moral authority to make the changes that they felt were needed to shield against attacks, regardless of compatibility, wouldn't they? Cf. BIP148 (rejecting miners' otherwise valid blocks), talks of changing PoW, etc. Either this is a personal belief of nullc's, which isn't shared by the Core devs as a whole, or it simply isn't consistent with the actions that some of them have taken - or advised. Anyway, I guess we can categorize it as a new number 7), and it still doesn't give a technical explanation of "why 2MB is bad".


Ignoring the hyperbole of "not even the slightest indication", which seems way overblown, this mostly falls into the category of number 2) and doesn't give a technical explanation of "why 2MB is bad".
Note that not one of nullc's arguments are in the style of technical explanations (like number 1) and number 4), above... can we then jump to the assumption that he doesn't agree with 1) and 4) being good arguments against S2X?). It's all about not going about it in the right way, not understanding what nullc has understood, and similar. Why?
Does any of his other posts elaborate on "the negative impact of increased capacity on the viability of the system" (which is what I believe LarsPensjo is asking for)?

[6, not 8]( ;)

How did you manage to send BTC to a Litecoin address? (Don't they usually start with L? Or was this a P2SH address starting with 3, which could also be considered a valid BTC address?)
Yes, should be able to recover it, but it'll be a hazzle unless someone (e.g. SatoshiLabs themselves) creates software specifically for it (like they did for retrieving BCH from BTC addresses - this'll be the same, except you'd be retrieving BTC from LTC addresses).
If you want to do it manually, you'll likely have to use the recovery seed (i.e. BIP39 Mnemonic) and possibly passphrase (if you've enabled that) at a site like this: 
(Note: This should ideally be done offline and/or on a computer that you trust hasn't been compromised in any way and/or a computer you can completely wipe afterwards, typically done by booting up from a live CD or something.)
Then, you'll have to find out the [BIP32 derivation path]( which in Trezor's case is modelled after [BIP44]( but with Litecoin's "coin number" (i.e. 2) istead of Bitcoin's (i.e. 0). Finally, the account number and address number depends on what Litecoin account/address you used - you should be able to find this info in the Litecoin wallet.
Eventually, you'll end up with a derivation path somewhat like this: m / 44' / 2' / 3' / 0 / 5
...which means:
44' = hardened key derivation according to BIP44
2' = hardened key derivation for Litecoin (i.e. [coin index 2](
3' = hardened key derivation for account# 4 (0-indexed)... you need to change this to the *actual* account number that you sent the BTC to, remembering to start counting from 0
0 = normal key derivation for external-facing address series (as opposed to internal "change" addresses, which would've been represented by a 1)
5 = normal key derivation for address# 6 (0-indexed)... you need to change this to the *actual* address number that you sent the BTC to, remembering to start counting from 0
Plot all of this info into the BIP39 site, above (again, do it offline, after saving that site locally - it doesn't need to be online to work), and you'll end up with a single private key that represents the Litecoin address in question.
Then, import this key into a Bitcoin (not Litecoin) wallet and you should be able to see and spend the BTC that were (incorrectly) sent to this "Litecoin" address.


This may be correct (if the address it was sent to was a Segwit address), but I'm not familiar with Trezor's Litecoin support and what kind of scripts/addresses it generates. If it was a premature Segwit-targetted transaction, you'll probably have to import the private key mentioned above in a Segwit-supporting BTC wallet (but that should be most of them, now that Segwit is about to get activated).

I agree it's certainly a building block, but I wouldn't call a timelocked tx a payment channel by itself, at least not in the "modern" understanding of the term. But feel free to define it otherwise for your purposes, of course. :)


And at that point, you'd have my support for calling it a payment channel. I understand that one can argue for either one being a channel, but a single timelocked tx falls outside my definition. :)


Why is that, again? Because txid + version is what you'd use to "track" the channel's progress (and txid can be malleated)?


I agree the technical details (and shortcomings) doesn't matter for the vision, but I see nothing in Satoshi's post indicating that he's talking about how to enable payment channels. What Satoshi describes sounds more like the presigned "dead man's switch" txs that  use, which I again wouldn't deem a payment channel just because it uses nlocktime.
@_date: 2017-08-10 23:22:34


That would be true, though. I think this is what you're trying to say: "This is like saying your left hand wouldn't be bound by the agreement because it was your right hand that signed it."

Will probably take some months before the number of real-usage segwit txs have any noticeable impact. The question is what happens with adoption in the mean time. (Adoption will likely have a bigger effect on block saturation than segwit, regardless of what *direction* adoption takes.)

I see what you're getting at, but I'm not sure I entirely agree.

Isn't he describing a tx that cannot be confirmed - but can be replaced - until a given time in the future? If so, that's not a payment channel, at least not by itself.
@_date: 2017-08-08 17:12:19


It doesn't and I never said that.
Let's say you start with 100.
A 30 % increase will, as you say, lead to 130.
But that's not what said. He said "Schnorr would save 30 %", which means transactions take only 70 % of the space they used to. So the question is: How many txs can you fit in same space that previously only had room for 100.
The equation then becomes 100/0.7 (which is ~142.86), not 100*1.3.
In other words, "saving 30 % of the space" is *not* the same as "having room for 30 % more".
You already know this intuitively by observing that if you save 50 % on something, you can afford 100 % more (twice as much or 200 %), *not* just 50 % more. It's the same concept with 30 % savings leading to 43 % more, just with less familiar/intuitive numbers. :)

The `importprivkey` command added the private key to Bitcoin Core (as well as the default 1-address which it corresponds to).
The `addwitnessaddress` command told Bitcoin Core to use *the same* private key for Segwit, which means it starts monitoring a second address (a 3-address) for the same private key.
It's the private key that you added that will enable Bitcoin Core to spend from both of these addresses. Segwit encodes that access in a different way (a different redeemscript), though, which means it will *appear* as a different address on the block chain.
Basically, you have a single private key which controls two different addresses (strictly speaking you can get an endless amount of addresses from a single private key, but it's typically better to stick to established ways of using Bitcoin scripts, rather than trying to create your own standards... right now, however, we're in the transition between two standards, which means that money can be sent to the same private key in two different ways, i.e. to two different addresses).
The wallet only keeps track of incoming txs though. To find historic txs for addresses in the wallet, it needs to rescan the block chain. This is one of the reasons why most people don't use full node software like Bitcoin Core as a wallet, but rather a more lightweight wallet (which gets its information from a server with a better database/index over txs and a good/quick way to query for them).


Yeah - which is why I warned you it would be slow. :(

@_date: 2017-08-24 19:53:38


Yep! :D


M-addresses are only used for Litecoin.
Now that it's activated on the Bitcoin network, you need to do the procedure above in Bitcoin Core instead of Litecoin Core, which means you'll be ending up with 1-addresses (Bitcoin) instead of L-addresses (Litecoin) and 3-addresses (Bitcoin-Segwit) instead of M-addresses (Litecoin-Segwit).
So... Just to understand your situation, here's some questions:
1) Have you downloaded Bitcoin Core and let it download/sync the block chain all the way up to today?
2) Were you able to type the `addwitnessaddress &lt;your-1-address-here&gt;` command in Bitcoin Core?
3) Did Bitcoin Core respond with the same 3-address that contains your money?
If you answer yes to all of the above, perhaps Bitcoin Core still needs to re-scan the block chain to detect that there's any money in the newly added (segwit) address.
You can do that by starting Bitcoin Core with the `-rescan` option:
a) Shut down Bitcoin Core.
b) Start it again from a "Run" window (which you get to by pressing Windows+R), like this:
[Image 1](
[Image 2](
[Image 3]( (Remember to manually type in `-rescan` at the end of the line, before pressing the `OK` button.)
You'll end up looking at a splash screen which *slowly* counts up from 0 to 100 %.
If even that doesn't work, I need more info about what's failing. ;)

If it saves 30 %, it should allow for ~1430 txs every 10 minutes - just like saving 50 % would allow for 2000 txs (i.e. double the amount).
If it really only allows 1300 txs (30 % more than before), that implies a saving of only 23 %.

It's possible, and you'd need to try to replicate the conditions that made the password incorrect in the first place, e.g. caps lock was pressed (meaning you'll have to inverse every small/capital letter in the password), or you placed one hand "one key off" to the right or left (happens sometimes even with good/fast typers, but perhaps not possible if you actually look at the keys as you click them), etc. Use your imagination. ;)

@_date: 2017-11-22 06:17:38


It would, but it [actually happened]( due to segwit activating on Litecoin(!) even earlier, and Litecoin initially using the same P2SH prefix/version (so-called `3`-addresses) as Bitcoin.


They were trying to send BCH to themselves, typically from an exchange to their hardware wallets (Trezor/Ledger). And since Trezor/Ledger changed to making BTC-segwit accounts the default pretty much right away after segwit activated, lots of people made the mistake of sending their BCH to a BTC-segwit address (since they copied the receiving address from the default account/currency instead of switching to BCH first... easy mistake to do for newbies).
The reason that this is possible at all is that A) BCH (for now) uses the same address prefixes as BTC (`1` for regular P2PKH and `3` for P2SH addresses), B) that segwit was implemented as a soft fork (template-based repurposing of already valid data structure) instead of a hard fork and C) that P2SH-wrapped BTC-segwit addresses are indistinguishable from any other kind of P2SH address since the address is derived from the hash of the redeemscript.
The hash obviously doesn't reveal anything about the script itself, so the sending wallet cannot verify if it's actually a valid script (e.g. multisig P2SH address) or an invalid one (e.g. segwit P2SH address... or whatever else that doesn't resolve correctly).
You can probably guess where the different subreddits put the blame (hint: they don't agree on whether A or B is the most egregious flaw). :P
If you're interested in the details, I did a writeup some months ago [here](


It requires that the public key (or its hash) is revealed, which will happen when spending from the same address on (and whose redeemscript is actually valid on) the BTC chain.


Probably didn't realize it. Most people just use the interface that their (hardware) wallet gives them. They have no chance of understanding - nor even being aware of - security gotchas like shared address prefixes across currencies or segwit redeemscripts being seen as so-called "anyone can spend" to the old rules (i.e. the BCH rules).

Technically correct - the best kind of correct? :P
The reason I added that was to make clear that using Bitcoin through a VISA card isn't the same as using Bitcoin directly. Perhaps there's better ways to explain that distinction, but I felt I needed to include the difference, somehow, without going into a long discussion about the details (like you are doing now, btw).
If people are curious about why this distinction exists, that's a starting point for a decent conversation. If people are alienated from a technology simply because it isn't regulated out of the box, however, that's on them - and I won't be humoring that outrage.

You're pointing out the difference between a full node and a SPV node, both of which are peers in the "p2p currency" context. If you can't explain it better than that, I think we'll have to stop at disagreeing about what a peer is then.
@_date: 2015-08-05 20:58:38
We can also assume that the combined expense of mining bitcoins will, over time, trend towards their market price.
Edit: So in a sense, mining could actually be construed as "buying bitcoins". ;)
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:40:08
In my understanding, SPV nodes/wallets/peers validate the headers of the all blocks (e.g. the Proof of Work) in the block chain, but they don't download all the txs in the block and compute the merkle tree root hash of them.
So, unless 1) miners waste huge amounts of money creating PoW for dishonest blocks or 2) you cannot connect to honest nodes - both of which are basic assumptions even for full nodes - an SPV node should be fine trusting txs with a handful of confirmations?
Still, my question started with SPV nodes presumably being peers (nodes) in the network and being able to send and receive txs to/from other peers without going through a third-party service, and I still don't see how that understanding could be wrong.

Wrong. When talking about peerness(?), we first need to establish the context (or, as you ninja-edited in: the abilities or qualifications in question). Otherwise there are no peers at all, as all nodes are *somewhat* different. You are talking about equality in validation behaviour when that is clearly, *clearly* not what my question was about (we're talking about *simplified* payment verification, after all).
So - I assumed you were answering my question about peers as in the "peer to peer cash" context of the whitepaper, i.e. peers in (the ability of) sending and receiving tokens of the currency (aka p2p electronic cash) with a certain amount of confidence in the tx's irreversibility, but apparently not.
Either way, this isn't productive any more (if it ever was). Peace out, bro.

Hey, sorry for the late reply. Were you able to solve this or do you still have this problem?


I'm not familiar with the Ledger wallet's interface (I've just used Trezor), but the root path that you mentioned is a very good starting point (i.e. it has the first three numbers, of the five you need).
The fourth number is pretty much always `0` and the fifth number is the address' index within the account. If you don't know the address' index number, you should be able to use the BIP32 page to find out the number matching the 3-address that you sent your money to with a 3-address from the BIP32 page, but of course it's somewhat difficult to get all the details right. Just say if you're stuck. ;)
@_date: 2015-08-11 11:39:42


Yup, that's what I tried to suggest two posts up. ;)
But if you have 12 seed words + a 13th *passphrase* (not password), the passphrase is actually an integral to the wallet derivation... which would explain why you don't see your funds if it's left out. But it doesn't explain why you *still* don't get access to your funds when you include it.
I suggest you ask someone more knowledgeable about Electrum about this, because at the face of it it doesn't make sense to me. ;)

If you use special chars as part of your password and have several keyboard layouts installed (in Windows), pressing alt+shift toggles between them - and thus affects what characters you type.
Or if you use one or more chars with high code points (i.e. higher than the ascii/iso-8859-x ranges) and the charset has changed between you typed it the first and later times. Either due to settings changes or due to Electrum not handling it consistently.
I haven't used the Electrum wallet myself, but... would it be possible to restore the wallet from the seed words using some other wallet, skipping the password altogether - or is it a passphrase that's part of the seed/wallet derivation function itself?

It *is* different because the participants' stakes are different than in your altcoin example.
Disregarding network effects within a single network, just because there exists other networks too (in the same sector), is intellectually, or at the very least economically, disingenious.
You can see this in the world at large too. Just because there's network effects and economies of scale doesn't mean that alternative networks won't form. Would you rather have a small stake in a huge network or a dominating position in a smaller network? Different people will answer that question differently and that's just one of the reasons we have altcoins.

This is silly. There's disagreement about the way forward, noone's going for a split, but if there *is* a split Core is splitting from Classic just as much as Classic is splitting from Core.
You don't seem to hold Core to the same standards regarding the policy changes that *they've* been introducing this last year. The roadmap, for example, was waay overdue, and there was much obfuscation (or perhaps, deliberation - which comes down to the same if you feel that any change should be announced from the get-go with a "we're splitting, who's with us?" announcement) and time lost before that.

Ok, but that's pretty obvious and not what I meant to ask and eventually kinda uninteresting. ;) IMHO, we're discussing the rules for what governance *should* look like, not what's technically possible.
I meant to ask what you think is a valid reason for condemning a change, i.e. what should constitute a de facto vetoing power.
That other post's "demands" are unreasonable because:
  just gets bogged down into a discussion about who are experts and who we can trust. After all, there's a genuine philosophical/political disagreement at the root of this divide, not merely a technical one, so each side will also have a different opinion about who the experts are. Pre-anointing experts preempts the discussion by elevating certain opinions in the first place. Yep, we're back to the technocracy that I commented on in some other posts. :(
  misconstrues the other party's motives and holds the sides to different standards. Why should one side be allowed to demand that "whoever disagrees with our path forward must clearly announce so, renounce any relation to our project, tie their own goals to a new project and new name and, finally, retroactively have declared all of this before they even knew there would be a fundamental disagreement". That unjustifiably elevates one side and is just not morally or socially right.
If those points ( and  are what is needed to be "responsible", you're effectively saying anyone who doesn't agree with your view is irresponsible, because no one will in practice do what you're suggesting.

What, how? What does block sizes have to do with controlling Bitcoin? You must be talking about some subset, not Bitcoin in its entirety. Can you clarify what they would gain control over?


Ok, I read that and it seems somewhat outdated to say the least.


Why is he talking about 1 MiB when the block limit is 1 MB? Sure, "only 5 % difference" - and perhaps he doesn't know it. But fair enough, not everyone cares about details.


He's concerned about bandwidth? Isn't that a moot point by now, with the new protocols for only sending block headers/metadata plus some rare unpooled txs here and there?


He said it.


Shouldn't be a problem as long as the block size doesn't increase more rapidly than miner bandwidth then?


If at first you're going to assume malice on the part of the miners, isn't the empty block problem (which could effectively shut down Bitcoin) a much larger issue?
I thought trusting the (majority of the) miners was an underlying assumption in Bitcoin?
And I still don't understand how block size gives the miners control of Bitcoin:
They can already censor txs, but we've seen next to nothing of the sort so far. They can already shut down Bitcoin, but we've seen nothing of the sort so far. They've already been able to pad blocks with additional data for years, but we've seen next to nothing of the sort.
What am I not understanding here?

Fair enough. I believe the second layer is less important than the second one. A problem in the second layer can always be "solved" (i.e. forked away from) in the first layer.

I meant that they didn't matter when it comes to consensus/activation of a change, not that they didn't matter to Bitcoin at all any more. I thought that was apparent from the context of this thread (and also from the part that you're quoting, for that matter). ;)


Perhaps "ignored" would be a better word, but I assume you mean that they're ignored only for consensus/activation of a change (as opposed to being ignored for everything), so I'm not sure the term change really gives us any further clarity?

My question was meant to be about the consensus mechanisms themselves, not about any particular issue. There's enough threads about the block size issue already. ;)


That's not my understanding of it. Emergent consensus also relies on the software/settings that users/nodes are running, doesn't it (i.e. both parties rely on each other)?


Good point. I think this must be the main distinction. Basically, miners doesn't matter in user-activated changes.
@_date: 2015-07-09 09:29:29
Wtf? What kind of information are you talking about?
@_date: 2016-02-15 02:39:17


Ok, that's a good clarification to have so I understand what position you're coming from.
Classic's position, as far as I've understood, is that *they're* the ones that are upholding the original vision (by some called the 'social contract' underlying Bitcoin). That is, not letting maxblocksize be a policy tool, but let the miners and users participate in a free market and make their own choices regarding these things. In other words, let maxblocksize continue to be an anti-DoS feature, not a market-policy tool.
From that position, the Core team are the ones "splitting" from Bitcoin. Hence the "Classic" name, I guess.
While I don't necessarily agree with Classic's stance, I accept that it's a coherent position to have - just as yours is too - so it all comes down to how we work with different opinions about what Bitcoin is, was and should be. Why would we elevate one position? I just don't get that.


Fully agree. That's not how I've come to understand their position, though. They're making an alternative client and letting people decide what future they want. I do not see why this is inherently bad.
As your OP's title eludes to: Anyone should have the right to express their own opinion, in words as well as in code. If people just don't support them, no harm's done, right?




Good summary. I'm just not as assertive as you are about how dissenters should and shouldn't act. Thanks for the discussion anyway. :)

When you said "What you're describing is like a proof of stake coin, where miners don't matter only users.", it sounded like you thought I was suggesting something that extreme. ;)


So, you're saying that miners matter, but they're being ignored? Is this a flaw of user activated changes ("UACs")? If so, is it a problem in general, or just of this particular UAC implementation that's floating around nowadays (BIP148)?
In what way do miners matter for UACs? Most other posters seem to imply that the whole point of UACs are to remove miners from the picture.


They'd still be on the majority chain too, right? (So the coins isn't the main problem, here.)


Not sure I still follow you. It sounds like you are arguing against UACs in general, now. Are we still talking about why "ignore" is (or isn't) a better term than "doesn't matter"?

Is this the old technocracy vs. democracy debate?
I thought it was widely accepted that network effects are what gives currencies their value? Doesn't that have implications for this discussion?
Wasn't one of the criticisms against Hearn that he wanted each project to have a maintainer/ruler with final authority to keep everything in line with his vision?
When there's a genuine difference of philosophy, like you describe in the posts above (a situation analysis that I agree with, btw), what's the difference between the minority disregarding the wants of the majority and having a small group of maintainers/rulers/technocrats with final authority to keep everything in line with their vision?

Thanks for the question and sorry for not being clear enough. In this context I meant that the users of a currency forms a network, whether it's the USD network, the BTC network or the LTC network.
(And when I say "user", I mean any kind of stake holder, both the holders of the currency, the merchants, the developers/politicians, the miners/banks, the payment processors, the VCs, etc. - basically any kind of organisational unit with a stake in the network.)

As points out, the LTC doesn't really affect the BTC at all, as they're completely separate blockchains/coins.
In this case, you just happen to have a *private key* that "controls" money on both chains, so if you're worried that the private key is getting compromised/exposed to others during this process, you *may* want to move the LTC away from the address controlled by this key as well. It's not really needed, but may help you sleep better. ;)

Ok, you're off to a good start, but I guess the 3 vs. M stuff is a bit confusing as it's Litecoin specific. If you sent LTC to a Bitcoin address, you only need to find the 3-address that you send money to and verify that it's actually got the money when viewing it on the Litecoin blockchain (for example by looking it up at

It doesn't matter (at a technical level, at least). The BTC and LTC would have nothing to do with each other as they're on different block chains.
The only "issue" would be privacy-wise (i.e. if people know you control litecoins at that address, they would know that you also have the key for the bitcoins at the same address), but that's arguably a minor issue - and a subjective one at that.

If I understand what you're saying and the [P2SH-P2WPKH docs]( correctly, you'd need to know the public key (or more precisely the [SHA256-RIPEMD160] hash of the public key) in order to create the correct redeemScript?
But what you really know is only the address, which is a hash of the redeemScript.
Thus you're left with a hash-reversal problem, for which the best known attack is brute force (i.e. trying all possible public keys and see what addresses they encode to), which isn't very appealing.
So as long as didn't reveal the public key (which he didn't) until segwit activated, his money wasn't really at risk.
(But yeah, that you only needed the public key, not the private key, is certainly a serious degradation of security, just not a "fatal" one by itself, at least in this particular instance.)
@_date: 2017-09-03 13:16:09


Some addresses can burn/eat/destroy coins due to the address itself being valid, but that there's no way to spend them from there (i.e. no one has the private key corresponding to the address).
An example of this is 1BitcoinEaterAddressDontSendf59kuE, which was made to demonstrate exactly this and which currently contains ~13 BTC (~$60k), still getting more every month.
In your case, your wallet *has* the private key, so it's "just" a matter of (manually) using it in a way that the wallet doesn't normallyfacilitate (e.g. using a key intended for BTC on the LTC chain or vice versa).

No, you don't need to do this. If you lost LTC, you only need Litecoin Core, not Bitcoin Core.
The reason the original guide mentioned Litecoin Core despite losing BTC was that segwit hadn't activated on the BTC chain yet, so I suggested he would do some "training" using Litcoin Core.
You, however, don't need this "training" step, so you should just go straight for you own currency's Core... which is Litecoin Core. :)

You are correct and should obviously be careful with where you enter your seed. Ideally, it should never touch an online device at all.


You can be excused for missing it, since the guide post itself doesn't expand on it, but it says "Go to your ***offline*** version of the [BIP39]( page".
You can read more about using it offline at the bottom of that page itself, under the section called "Offline Usage" (it's designed for offline usage, after all, and it's open source, so if you do it properly the site itself won't be a risk - but malware on your computer *may*).
The guide post's own mention of "offline usage" is a reference to my [first post]( further up in the same thread, where I point out the following: "(Note: This should ideally be done offline and/or on a computer that you trust hasn't been compromised in any way and/or a computer you can completely wipe afterwards, typically done by booting up from a [live OS DVD] or something.)"
I've also mentioned it a couple of other times, from different angles, but when linking directly to a solution it sometimes goes unnoticed.
From [here]( "However, remember that your Trezor recovery seed is the "master key" for all the Trezor wallet's private keys, including all Bitcoin and Litecoin (and other currencies') keys. So if the seed is compromised (e.g. due to malware on your computer), all your money could theoretically be stolen. This is why I stressed (in the guide-thread) that one should use the BIP39 page in offline mode and ideally restart the machine to avoid the seed lingering in memory."
From [here]( "PS: Protect your Trezor seed by keeping it offline, if possible. This means that you ideally should save the [BIP39]( page to a USB stick, or something, and only open it on a computer that isn't online. Preferably also on a computer that can be wiped after you've used it, for example by booting from a live DVD/USB stick of [Tails](
From [here]( "...but beware that you do it in a safe way (offline, clean computer, etc.). After all, the purpose of the Trezor is keeping the keys (including the seed that they're generated from) offline. Typing the seed into a PC with malware could lead to losing all one's money. ;)"

The M- and 3-addresses can be used interchangeably (in wallets that support that)... Basically, they *are* the same address, just encoded in different ways.
To convert between them, use this page: 
If you enter your M-address (returned by the `addwitnessaddress` command), you'll get a 3-address back, which should be the same as the address you sent your Litecoin to (if you've done the other steps correctly).
Another way to do it is to look up the address using  the  explorer, as it will show both the 3- and the M-address for any P2SH address you view.
In other words, you don't need to do anything to add the 3-address to Litecoin Core. It's already being monitored, it's just being displayed as an M-address.


You don't need to do anything in Bitcoin Core. The only reason I told to install both Litecoin Core and Bitcoin Core was that segwit hadn't activated on the Bitcoin chain yet, so he'd "train" using Litecoin Core while later using Bitcoin Core for the real recovery of his BTC.
Now that segwit's activated on both chains, people will just need the software that corresponds to their currency (i.e. Litecoin Core for LTC and Bitcoin Core for BTC, obviously :)).
(I guess the lack of clarity regarding this makes the guide above somewhat hard to follow at the end.)


If the key you've added actually corresponds to the 3-address that your money were sent to, the last step you may be missing is to do a resync? I explained how to do that in [this post]( further down in the original thread.
Good luck! :)

Sorry, I should've said "passphrase", or what people often refer to as the "extra word" in the BIP39 mnemonic. [Technically]( it's a salt which is used when deriving a seed from the mnemonic, which means any passphrase is accepted, but you'll get a different seed (and thus wallet) depending on which passphrase you enter.
This is also what gives you so-called plausible deniability if you use two different passphrases to arrive at two different wallets: use one passphrase to arrive at your primary wallet, where you put your long-term holdings, and another passphrase to arrive at a secondary wallet - which you could use for small amounts, daily spending and as a decoy if you're ever forced to give up your passphrase or someone tries to force you to "show" how many bitcoins you own.
You can read about it it Trezor's manual [here](
1. You initialize your Trezor, chosing to add a PIN and a passphrase (then write down the mnemonic, typically 24 words). The mnemonic will be stored in the device while the PIN and passphrase won't.
2. The PIN is only needed for [some operations]( and will typically not be asked until you want to sign a transaction or message. The PIN is a device setting, meaning you'll be asked the *same* PIN regardless of which HD wallet/account you're trying to use. It's not important to write down, as you can reset/recover your wallet without it.
3. A passphrase, however, is integral to deriving the wallet seed - and seeing as it's forgotten once you unplug the Trezor, it means the Trezor doesn't actually store your full wallet seed (unless you chose not to use a passphrase, of course), it only stores the mnemonic (24 words) which would otherwise be quite tedious to enter every time.
 When you connect your Trezor (e.g. to myTrezor or Mycelium) you'll be asked to supply a passphrase so it can complete the seed generation and derive your wallet from it.
4. Finally, for additional security, you decide on (or ideally: randomly generate) and write down two different passphrases, one for your main wallet and one for your secondary.
 You should memorize at least the secondary wallet's passphrase so that you can spend small amounts on-the-go, but you should store both passwords safely and tell some trusted party how to retrieve them (in case you have a memory loss or die), just like the mnemonic words themselves.
 If you lose or damage the Trezor or for whatever other reason need to recover the wallet elsewhere, you can use the mnemonic + passphrase to set it up from scratch (either in a second Trezor device or some other BIP44-supporting software - like Mycelium).
If you follow this procedure, it should give you protection against software attacks (which can't get at the keys in the Trezor) as well as theft (they won't have the PIN or the passphrase) and possibly even physical threats (you can try to only give up the passphrase for the secondary wallet and see if that throws them off).

Yes, all Trezor keys/addresses are derived from the same master/recovery seed. So it's possible to find the LTC key - which is really just a number - and reuse that same key (i.e. number) on the BTC chain.

I said that Bitcoin isn't an application because you mentioned you're able to understand/use Adobe Illustrator (which *is* just an application) and wondered why you couldn't figure out Bitcoin. :)
Sure, there's ways to apply Bitcoin, but unless you're a developer (which I assume you're not), you're going to have to interface with the technology through applications (mostly web applications/services, but possibly also mobile apps or even desktop apps) that others make on top of the tech itself.
I advised you to contact a Bitcoin payment processor because you mentioned the specific use case of accepting international payments, and they offer exactly the services you need for that (provided your customer is also able to get ahold of bitcoins to pay you with, of course).
If you want to understand the technology, you're up for a much longer ride as it's built "on the shoulders of giants" (i.e. lots of other techs that came before it) and there's a lot of prerequisite knowledge you need to understand the details (e.g. digital signatures, message digests, shortcomings of the incumbent payment systems, an understanding of what *money* really is, etc.).
Some people "get" it because they have all the prerequisites, that is the "mental hooks" on which to hang the new knowledge. Others start at the practical side and "get" it once they just start using it.
I see others have advised you to get your feet wet by using it and I think that's a good idea. Here's one way to do it:
* Make an account at [ChangeTip]( and buy $5 worth of bitcoins from them (I think you can but that amount instantly and without any identification).
* Send a tip via a reddit comment and ask someone to send some of it back to you.
* Transfer $2 to a mobile Bitcoin wallet (e.g. Mycelium if you're using Android, or Breadwallet if you're using iOS), then donate $1 of it to [Wikipedia]( (scroll down to the "Donate Bitcoin" button) or [Mozilla]( or one of the other charities that have listed [here](
Realize that your transaction could theoretically have transferred value equal to $1 million at the same speed and near-zero cost as your $1 transaction. Look up your charity donation on [blockchain.info]( and start pondering what this kind of open ledger could mean for transparency and accountability in NGOs and governments.
After this, you'll have the required "hooks" to attach the sidebar info onto and it will all start making sense. You can then begin digging into the technology that makes it all work, if you feel like, or just think about the high-level applications this system could have in all kinds of financial services in general.
Good luck. :)

1. What we typically call off-blockchain transactions are equivalent to the internal adjustments to accounts within a single bank, i.e. crediting one account and debiting another. Examples of this are ChangeTip tips and Coinbase-to-Coinbase transactions.
2. What we typically call on-blockchain transactions are equivalent to RTGS, where the blockchain takes the role of the central bank, any bitcoin address (and its key pair) is equivalent to an account with the central bank and transactions are final because the transfers of bitcoins (the unit of account for this particular central bank) are irreversible.
 On-blockchain transactions are better than RTGS, though, because they cost less than the £25 of CHAPS (and the probably similar costs for using FedWire and Target2)?
3. Micropayment channels are somewhat equivalent to correspondent banking agreements, where you have bilateral (two-party) agreements, one or both parties agrees to tie up a certain amount with the other party and transactions can be instantly confirmed/accepted by adjusting the balances of the parties within the channel, while actual settlement is deferred.
 Micropayment channels are better than correspondent banking, though, because the credited party can, at **any** point in time, choose to end/settle the channel by transmitting the latest agreed-upon transaction to the network for inclusion in the blockchain. There's also no counterparty risk and the cost is negligible (apart from the opportunity cost of the tied up value).
4. Hub-and-spoke networks, with a mesh of channels, are equivalent to correspondent banking routes with two or more "hops", and with the same improvements upon traditional banking systems as outlined in point 3, above. or Standardized networks with known "superhubs" could evolve into something DNS-like (DNS = deferred net settlement) for the cryptocurrency world, e.g. a 'switch'-based scheme, like VISA/MasterCard? Is that what we're seeing the start of with PayPal's baby steps into the Bitcoin world?
5. While we don't have a well-established equivalent to SWIFT (that is, a secure network for inter-party communication), this will surely emerge over time, and there's several contestants already. [Subspace]( is one example.
Looking at it from this perspective, it's quite easy to see how bright bankers are saying this could disrupt the "payment rails" of inter-bank settlements. All the legacy systems can be implemented on top of Bitcoin, which comes with a native and programmable currency, world-wide presence and is open-for-all.

I think that's true, but that's a couple of orders of magnitude more difficult and probably not something you'd do unless you knew a lot about the target. It's also not possible to do remotely, i.e. proof against pure software attacks.
Further, I don't think the password is stored on the Trezor, so they'd still need to force *you* to cooperate, and I don't think it's reasonable to expect a $100 dongle to solve that kind of problem. ;)

It's plaintext, afaik, but they'd need to root the phone to get it. Probably not something you should rely on for storing large amounts.

Next time you could show how one would add the Trezor account permanently to Mycelium (i.e. importing the xpubkey, as opposed to just fire-and-forget cold wallet spending).
That way you can use Mycelium to monitor your Trezor account(s) and plug it in only when it needs to sign a transaction.

You're a maker when you place a limit order, regardless of whether it's a bid or an ask.

Correct; using a passphrase is not the default, while a PIN is required. You can see the initial setup process in the first images of [this album]( You don't get to decide whether you want a passphrase or not initially, i.e. the same design choice Mycelium has made.
Why? My guess would be that people normally expect a "password" like this to be restorable or overwritable if they forget it, while here it would mean that you'd lose access to your wallet with no recourse. Thus, it's a good idea that you do your research and understand the implications of a BIP39 passphrase before you enable it.
You can enable passphrases under [advanced settings]( (meaning that myTrezor/Mycelium will start asking you for a phrase as part of its startup flow).


It is. The compromised computer will never learn the wallet seed words (BIP39 mnemonic) or private keys even if it learns the passphrase.
The main point of using passphrases is protecting your seed words backup (i.e. they're useless without the passphrase - as long as the passphrase isn't stored along with them, of course) and possibly to create the plausible deniability setup as explained above.


You'd have to ask the developers about this, but primarily because it was possible. When thinking of security, you normally want several layers of security. With PINs, it was possible to make a way to hide this from the computer - so why not do it? With passphrases, displaying a full keyboard on the Trezor is impractical.
Keep in mind that the *main* purpose of the PIN is to prevent people from stealing your money just because they have physical access to your Trezor. Entering the PIN in the way it's done makes it a lot harder to casually observe it "over the shoulder" of someone - i.e. the same kind of security that ATMs and PoS terminals asks you to apply when covering your PIN code.

There's a lot of services that allow downloading transactions for tax purposes, so perhaps you can persuade people to contribute for research purposes?
Maybe first make an anonymizer script which substitutes the addresses for surrogate keys? The training wouldn't need them to be actual bitcoin addresses, it'd just need to learn the transaction patterns.
Or perhaps you could talk to existing companies' compliance officers and see if they're willing to provide you with anonymized data in exchange for them being able to use the result, if it's any good.

Taint analysis? Train on sets of:

2. internal movement transactions - where all outputs are controlled by the same user
3. tumbler transactions where you know how the input eventually got distributed into outputs
Afterwards, run it with a specific input and output as parameters and have it tell you the chance (confidence level) for them being the same user.

Satoshi's ahead of you: Already in the original whitepaper, in chapter 7, "Reclaiming Disk Space", he describes pruning of old blocks: "Once the latest transaction in a coin is buried under enough blocks, the spent transactions before
it can be discarded to save disk space."
All that's needed to validate the blockchain are the block headers. "Transactions" that are used to store illegal material often won't be spendable anyway and can be pruned at will without doing much harm, particularly in the small subset of nodes that for whatever reason need to.
The node software (e.g. Bitcoin Core) would have to facilitate this, which it doesn't right now, but this is nowhere near an elephant-size task and if Bitcoin's future was at stake it could be done without forks and probably quickly and without controversy too.
(And [it will be done anyway]( at some point, in the name of scalability.)

1. I'm not in the UK, but perhaps  which seem to have their banking relationships in order now: 
2. Technically, multi-sig paper wallets, which you generate offline, and store the keys for in separate locations (banks' safety deposit boxes, for example). However, that just *might* be too much work - and overkill for £ 1000. ;)
 If you want to have access to spending your coins on the go while still keeping the keys offline, I'd suggest a different approach: Buy a [Trezor]( write down its recovery seed and store it in two separate locations, while using the Trezor + a mobile app that supports it for spending (like the newly released [Mycelium v2.3](
 The latter setup should give you a good balance between convenience (easy app access) and security (keys never leave the Trezor and as far as I know there's no confirmed reports of it being remotely compromised ever).
Good luck! :)

Correct. Unless he pays someone else to transfer bitcoins to you, he needs a way to aquire bitcoins himself before he can send any to you.

Bitcoin is a technology, not an application, so it's not like there's a single way to *apply* it to your life. Your question is equivalent to asking how to apply e-commerce to your life if all your experience so far has been with cash. There's more than one way to do it.
There's lots of different payment processors for bitcoin transactions (just like there are for dollars), of which the most known are BitPay and Coinbase.
There's lots of different ways to store your bitcoins, each of which have their own pros and cons. You can even ask the processors to convert their value into USD right away, so you don't even have to think about handling the bitcoins.
There's vendors with point of sale terminals that support Bitcoin, although most still don't.

Security-wise it doesn't matter, as the private keys are never sent over the network.
Privacy-wise you can hide what you're doing by using encrypted connections (e.g. https) to whatever service you're using to broadcast the transaction. Most services/wallets should have this set up by default.
And if you're technically inclined and want to go the extra mile, tunnel the traffic through to somewhere else using VPN, TOR or SSH.

Also, in the first example, the "server" should hold the cake both before and after the transaction. He should just've transferred it from one hand to the other - that way, the cake is really gone when the server blows up.

If so, perhaps there's a problem with the IP address that your node announces.

It means "extended public key", and you can read more about it in the [HD wallet ('BIP-0032') specification](
Basically, it's a "parent" public key with some added data (entropy), which is used to derive "child" public keys in wallets that follow the HD (hierarchical deterministic) scheme.
I believe the reason people typically abbreviate it as "xpub" (or "xprv" for extended private key) is that the specification's [serialization format]( lays out an encoding scheme which means they'll start with "xpub" when displayed as text, i.e. somewhat similar to regular Bitcoin addresses starting with "1", Litecoin addresses starting with "L", etc.
As they include more data than a regular key, they're quite a bit longer than you're used to, e.g. xpub661MyMwAqRbcFtXgS5sYJABqqG9YLmC4Q1Rdap9gSE8NqtwybGhePY2gZ29ESFjqJoCu1Rupje8YtGqsefD265TMg7usUDFdp6W1EGMcet8.
[Trezor's API]( includes a method for reading xpubkeys from the device so that external wallet software (like Mycelium or myTrezor) can "see" (and generate) addresses that belong to a particular trezor, make transactions for it to sign, etc.

Less security and privacy? :P


In your scenario banks get something for nothing. That's partly true (i.e. they *do* get whatever interest was paid), but it's not the whole picture. When the individual used the debt-money to pay for the house, and the money thus got transferred into another bank, the first bank would have to settle this transaction with the second bank. (You can read more about the deferred net settlement system system [here](
So, the bank will have lost some of their reserves (depending on how much the individual paid back before going bankrupt) in exchange for the house. This settlement responsibility is what keeps banks from creating too much money out of thin air; too many rotten loans would eventually drain the bank itself.


Not necessarily, as with each transaction all inputs are "melted" together. This mechanism is what makes it possible to "mix" coins to (try to) remove their "taint" (i.e. the trace of where they've previously been). If this keeps happening, you'll eventually end up with each coin being able to trace their ancestry back to hundreds, possibly thousands, of different coinbases (i.e. "moment[s] it was mined").
Add to that the fact that several proposals for how to make the transaction amounts private and it's not given that Bitcoin will always be as traceable as it is today.

Michael, who answered you above, is a representative of Coinbase, a payment processor that allows you to accept Bitcoin but get paid in dollars or bitcoins (your choise).
If you chose the former, everything works as before (you'd have to ask them what commerce/accounting plugins they provide if you want to automate the process, though).
If you chose the latter, you may want to take a look at the writings of [This]( is a good starting point (he links to his previous posts).

The coinbase transaction is hashed and put on the tree, like all other transaction, right? The output of the coinbase transaction, i.e. the ledger entry that what we call "bitcoins", gradually increases (grows) as it's updated to account for the transaction fees of the other transactions as they're added to the tree.
So the bitcoins themselves grow on the tree. The fact that the trees are chained together (and frozen in time as they become part of a valid block) doesn't change that.

Decentralization provides two central benefits: Censorship resistance and double-spending protection.
MasterCard is already censoring transactions while Bitcoin isn't. As long as a non-negligible part of Bitcoin mining isn't centrally controlled, it will probably remain so.
Double-spending protection is harder. MasterCard ensures that with complex fraud protection systems (which aren't perfect, nor cheap). Bitcoin is probably currently vulnerable to collusion from Chinese miners - or takeover from the Chinese government. And the US could probably gain a dominating portion of mining power if they wanted to (and when they do, they'll keep it secret until they want/need to use it).

This. If it magically jumped to 10k, sure, everyone would sell, but that's not how markets move - even bitcoin. People with a non-hodling mindset would sell long before 10k; and if they bought back in, how would they know it wouldn't go even higher?
This line of thought would be valid at any point during its ascent and basic market psychology shows that most people are more likely to buy, not sell, during price spikes.

Storage of value isn't a boolean property, i.e. something you either have or don't. Instead, it's something an asset can be better or worse at - thus you'll have to evaluate the risk before trying to use any medium as a storage. That goes for physical as well as virtual assets, so there's no point making that distinction in this scenario.
Is this sense, the concept of "storage of value" is very different from storage of data. The former exists as a diffuse spectrum from "good" (or even "perfect"?) to "bad" storage, while the latter has an absolute 1-to-1 requirement (whatever you put in must be equal to whatever you take out, or it is by definition corrupted).
With modern economy inherently dealing in soft, often behavioral analyses, rather than absolute truths and entirely rational actors, I'm sure you understand and recognize this concept in many other areas of your field as well.
If you're down to nitpicking on the meaning of "storage" in an absolute sense, I'm not interested.

Only for provable decentralization. Emergent (yet unprovable) decentralization, on the other hand, is more of a game theoretic scenario and requires "only" the right incentives. Satoshi's vision seems (to me) to have focused on economic incentives, not provable decentralization.

Sex is a very bad unit of account because you can't compare two "sexes" (it's doesn't even have a plural form - in the sense that I'm trying to use it here) objectively. It's not divisible, it's not fungible, it's not storable, etc. It's ephemeral and highly subjective. How can that be a unit of account?
Similarly, a horse isn't a good unit of account because no two horses are alike. They have all kinds of other properties besides being a horse (beauty, health, weight, ownership, history, and so on and so forth). They can't be divided in order to represent any value, you can't pay 5 % of your horse in taxes, they'll get hungry and eventually die, my horse can be worth 10 of yours, etc.
Bitcoin, on the other hand, is a good unit of account because it's highly divisible (can represent any value), there's (in theory) no difference between different bitcoins - they're all objectively alike, fungible (although that property *may* be threatened). They also don't crumble or deteriorate over time, which makes them good candidates for long-term storage - but that's beside the point, I guess.

I just bought Trezor (with the opensourcematters code, like a lot of others) and I don't want to give my master xpub to the "third party" mytrezor website, so I haven't initialized it yet and was waiting for the rumoured Mycelium integration. ;)
It's also too hard for newbies (and even non-technical vets) to use the python scripts to initialize it - just take a loot at the Trezor sub and you'll see this is a problem for a lot of people.
The community needs a newbie-friendly way to set up and use their Trezor, all the way from the start, which also respects the users' privacy (i.e. not having to give up their master xpub to some third party).
My choice of one-stop-shop would be Mycelium (+ Tor), and I'd certainly push a few of my less-techie friends to do this as well, but unfortunately it's not possible (yet). :(
(I was hoping you could reuse at least some of the ui/ux for setting up/restoring "regular" Mycelium HD accounts for this too, but I haven't really read up on how much work it would be (i.e. how much it would differ).)

Nope. Bitcoin was the first block chain under my definition. I did not agree, I only asked you to give examples of previous block chains (i.e. I gave you the benefit of doubt). You've not given any examples of block chains, just of a block cipher algorithm, which isn't the same.

Yet, here we are, two months from the post, and the ETA has barely changed (i.e. by one day).
Have you forgotten that Bitcoin retargets its difficulty (based on the perceived hash rate of the longest chain)? This means that regardless of the technology breakthroughs "in a hundred years", difficulty is tuned so that blocks are found every 10 minutes anyway.
And since this retargetting is done every two weeks there will most likely only be small fluctuations in the ETA as new hashing power is added/removed - and then the network difficulty "catches up" and adjusts for it within weeks. (And that was the context in which the OP was made.)

Most *full* nodes do. It seems you've forgotten to include SPV wallets and other software in your analysis, though.
These clients are a part of the network too, in the sense that they connect to the full nodes and use their "services"/bandwidth, but they don't accept connections themselves. And why would they? They're just the users' wallets, scanning for incoming transactions and whatnot, and they don't store the block chain anyway, so they wouldn't be able to contribute much even if they were to advertise themselves.
But that's the point of having an open/permissionless network, isn't it? Anyone can connect and build services (of which wallets are arguably the simplest kind) on top of the Bitcoin network without being *required* to give anything back - at least not up front.

Every hop in the chain needs to "lock" it, but in a fully developed LN payments will flow both ways between the central LN nodes so that the streams will pretty much cancel each other out and only a much smaller *net* sum needs to be locked up at any point in time.
In this way, LN will operate similarly to a "[deferred net settlements]( system, rather than the "real-time gross settlements" system of the block chain.
In short: The locked up funds will not be as large as one might think from naively looking at the system.
@_date: 2015-10-22 14:07:20


Nah, a wheel is fundamental to a car. CBC is only similar, but Bitcoin's block chain structure was built as a time stamping mechanism (and probably gets its inspiration from there), not as a block cipher.
I'd say CBC is to Blockchain like a house is to a car (they're similar in the sense that both have seats/chairs, but neither their origin nor their purpose are the same).

Mycelium would get the xpubkey from the Trezor so that it knows what outputs are available (i.e. the "balance" on the Trezor).
Mycelium would then create transactions like normal - except that it only has the xpubkey, so it can't sign them. It sends a request for signing the transaction to the Trezor, which it would do only after the user accepts it by pressing the physical button on the device.
What do you mean by "opposite direction"? (The answer is probably 'no'. ;))

No, it's the other way around. A private key deterministically translates into a single public key, but a lot of different private keys will translate into that same public key.

I think the problem is that some of us see these fundamental properties as qualification for being good money or not, while others evaluate the current situation and discuss if they're actually being used as money *today* - so we're basically talking about different issues.
The latter analysis basically sums up to "it's not money, because it's not money *yet*", which doesn't make much sense to me. It's also self-evident, so why would one even discuss it?
So, perhaps we already agree? 1. Bitcoin has all the properties it needs to be good money (well, far better than sex and horses, anyway), and 2. Bitcoin isn't widely (for most definitions of "wide") *used* today.
Is that a fair conclusion?

I'm not sure if you're reading what I'm writing or just ignoring it.
It's not about BIP101, it's about *how* we resolve differences in views. Due to different backgrounds, personalities, goals, incentives, etc. there's *bound* to be irreconcilable differences, both now (BIP10x) and in the future.
The main fight is over how we approach these situations.
Do we allow people to express, and promote, different views/solutions or do we (try to) force everyone into consensus? Are alternative views tolerated or is the very notion of not confirming a "crime" by itself?
Do we allow the community to vote with whatever means they have access to (i.e. mining power, public talks, voting and discussing, writing code, etc. - I'm not talking about shit like DDoS-ing nodes, attacking the network as a whole and centralized censorship, ofc) or do we force the community to split in order to freely express themselves?
As far as I've seen, the views of the two "camps" vary widely in how we approach the problem of governance/resolution.

As long as you file your reports and pay your taxes, you're cooperating (the extent of which can be argued, of course).
There never was, and never will be, an explicit agreement, but you'll find a lot people saying you're implicitly agreeing - although under threat of fines and/or imprisonment. Which is (at least one of the reasons) why I said that it's not a morally valid agreement. It's not like people have a practical alternative.
You're still cooperating, though - unless you've found a way to evade taxes without getting caught (which I wouldn't advice).

He's talking about the properties (which should be obvious from the "scale has nothing to do with it" comment), while you're talking about the additional function(s) it gets with more use/trust/demand. The former is more or less a binary/digital (true or false) analysis and doesn't depend on use, the latter is emergent/analog and depends heavily on actual use.
He says it's money because it has all the properties it needs. You say it isn't because it's still a caterpillar. Basically, you have different opinions on what the definition of "money" should be. Both are right within their own definition/perspective, but you'll never agree unless you start talking about the same thing.

The idea is sound. The downside is that payment channels for instant payments must be set up in advance. If they manage to get a hub network set up and users adopt it (e.g. by it being integrated in major wallets) we'll have instant, near fee-less transactions and enough scalability to cater to everyone converting to bitcoin. Depending on how the hubs operate, we could also get increased anonymity. :)

A regular hard fork (i.e. one without wipeout protection) only goes its own way if it has *more than* 50 % long-term support from miners, while a regular soft fork only goes its own way if it has *less than* 50 % long-term mining support.
Segwit2x, if it includes wipeout protection due to an above-1MB block requirement at the forking point, will be both a hard and soft fork at the same time, which would ensure it goes its own way regardless of support - and it's exactly this property that gives it its wipeout protection.

Exactly! It is less restrictive in that it *allows* above-1-MB-size blocks, while at the same time it is more restrictive in that it *doesn't allow* below-1-MB-size blocks (even if the latter rule only applies for a single block - the one that ensures a permanent chain split - aka wipeout protection). :)


It would also be more "aggressive", and for now it seems Garzik's fork is all about catering to all sides for as long as possible. There's probably a lot that can be said about strategies either way, but that's more of a political, rather than technical, debate.

There was a thread on a week or two back linking directly to one of Luke's posts - and that proved it by his own words. I don't remember the exact wording any more, and I can't find it atm (I'll try later, when I have more time; Luke posts so much that it'll take forever to load a post that was years back from scrolling down in his profile), but in the post Luke either said something like "... after I co-founded Blockstream" or something quite similar.
For now, this is the closest thing I found, but it's not proof as Luke doesn't confirm the OP's claim - he doesn't deny it and expands on it, though: 
[His answer]( still implies that he was heavily involved at the start, but didn't like it - more or less on principle alone - and preferred being listed as a "contractor" instead.
The other post I read, which I'll try to dig up somehow, was much more to the point about him actually being a co-founder.

Bitcoin is an exiting journey of sci-fi money and services, a mind-bogglingly deep world-wide social and economic experiment and a beacon of light for both the poor and the rich everywhere in the world - all rolled into one slow-motion feed of heroes and anti-heroes, of drama, betrayal and opportunity.
I love Bitcoin because it re-ignites the sparks of hope and faith in the world of tomorrow - that we've all somehow lost along the way.

Thanks for stating your point more succinctly.
My point is that ETAs are *inherently* changing over time (it's not a fixed TA, after all) - they obviously do so when the circumstances change. So the naive calculation has a value, even if it requires a deeper understanding of what situations can cause it to change in order to properly appreciate what it tells and doesn't tell us.
Apart from that, I think we're beating a dead horse here. You think the changes can be so large as to make the naive ETA so far off as to be pointless in the first place; I think it has a value despite its (known) shortcomings, even if it's weeks off. Your mining profitability perspective doesn't matter to me at all, but if that's what your grievance is, at least I can see where you're coming from.
Good evening and thanks for the discussion. You may have the last word, if you want. :)

Most western governments, including legislative and regulating bodies, are thoroughly captured by capital forces and corporations, c.f. [Gilens' flatline]( and [vote buying]( in Congress.
This means that governments will do whatever benefits capital forces. If that turns out to be letting Bitcoin flourish, so it will be.
Thus, if we're really up for talking about elephants in the room, what would really ensure Bitcoin's long-term success is, perhaps unfortunately, that we make sure that already rich people profit more from its success than its demise (or at least think that they will).
The first step of which is bringing them on board - which may be why there's so much effort being invested into putting lipstick on the pig for Wall Street.

Indeed, any soft forking software makes the "old" rules a hard fork from its own perspective.
This is where PoW makes the difference:
If the old software (hard fork) *doesn't keep* hash-power majority, its blocks will be overturned by the new software's.
If the old software (hard fork) *keeps* its hash-power majority, a split will happen, BIP148-style.
In this way, a soft fork with a minority of hash-power has the same forking/splitting properties as a hard fork with a majority (i.e. risks a chain split) - and vice versa: a hard fork with a minority of hash-power has the same forking/splitting properties as a soft fork with a majority (i.e. doesn't risk a chain split).
This explains why SFs have traditionally been described as a safer way to do upgrades (under the assumption that a PoW majority *for* the change exists, an assumption that have often gone unstated [but have still been implied by various hard-coded activation thresholds]). But it also asserts that a PoW-minority SF is just as unsafe/risky as a PoW-majority HF.
Is anything wrong with this logic?

Did you see the [lightning network]( thread? There's a decent summary there.
What hubs can do depends on how they're implemented.
In the "[standard]( way, they can steal one micropayment (and then you wouldn't trust them).
If you add the requirement that you need to know a secret that the payee chooses (i.e the HTLC, hashed time-lock contracts that the Lightning Network slides mention) a hub can only delay the payment (and if it kept doing this, people would stop using it).
@_date: 2015-02-17 23:19:51
Fair enough, I guess it differs from person to person. Thanks. :)
@_date: 2015-02-28 04:55:07
It probably wouldn't be an open peer-to-peer network, it would consist of (semi)trusted point-to-point channels (agreements) all the way from payor to payee. If both were using the same service (e.g. coinbase's hub), it could be just two channels (two "hops" in the network).
I'm not sure what you mean by DDoS in this context. I'm sure the agreements between hubs would include a rate of transactions per second and breaches of the agreement would lead to that payment channel being taken down (i.e. reconciliated with the blockchain).
I wouldn't know what "armies of bots" cost. :D

@_date: 2016-07-09 05:52:13


Yes, most likely.


After you've made a transaction, the BTC from that paper wallet aren't "on paper" any more. All the bitcoins are transferred to new addresses, not just the part that you spend. Read about 'change addresses' and make sure you understand how your wallet handles it before you delete anything, or your funds will be at risk!


Yes, but once they're "swept", they're not on paper any more (depends slightly on the wallet implementation, but that's how you should treat it until you *know* how the wallet handles your bitcoins).
@_date: 2015-02-28 05:09:05
It's not an open network, so spamming hubs wouldn't have any effect. That's like saying you could take down the web by sending out an army of web servers.
Think of payment channels like a customer relationship. You'd sign up with a hub (or several), e.g. Mycelium's hub (which would be integrated into their app) and they wouldn't have any reason to serve you badly. You'd just ignore the army of other hubs that were out there.
In the Lightning Network slides they talk about channels lasting e.g. 30 days (which in the case of a misbehaving hub would lock up the initial payment you put down for that channel for a month), so it isn't something you'd be establishing with random hubs here and there.
