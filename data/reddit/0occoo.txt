Yeah seems to be the case.

Damn...so say the Chinese government decided they want to control all the mines and seize them all for themselves by force (I know this is probably against their own interests, but say it hypothetically happens due to unforeseen circumstances). Then they could control over 51% of hashing power in the network and basically confirm or deny whichever transactions they want, no?

Oh ok cool. So in my hypothetical example of the Chinese gov cntrolling all mines, the nodes can just say "nope! We dont agree with those mines blocks anymore!" That's reassuring

I see what you mean. But I figured nodes would still be widely distributed even if mining power was usurped by a government

Besides hard fork like you just mentioned... i guess that is a can of worms tho
