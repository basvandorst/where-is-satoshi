Verification can be quick but you will have a 50 dollar limit for a while.  I got my friend to sign up at around 250 he's been trying to get 1 btc.  Really frustrated as the price keeps rising and can only buy chunks of $50

You make it seem like Noone is crossing the borders illegally.  In Arizona alone over 1000 people cross the border a day of course no one really knows..  Drug runners, and also just the poorest of the poor.  
Wants open borders then complains about income inequality etc.  Liberal logic.  Which non diverse enclave do you live in? I've noticed the people pushing for open borders make sure they live far from this diversity.  I could go through your history but too lazy.

Lol did go back in your history.  Appears you live in New Hampshire.  Never fails. People scolding others on race relations always seem to live in the least "diverse" places in the country.   I'm so not racist!  But I'll just live in my super majority white area! Not that it matters! Lol
@_date: 2015-07-11 22:45:37
Well my change usually just gets lost into the abyss anyways.  I guess I'd be more alert to collect it if I knew I could turn it to bits even if a chunk was taken out.  Good points though.

It's the job of the federal government to secure the borders dumbass.  Accept open borders and diversity you racist republican! (Sent from my iPhone in my all white neighborhood)  Funny thing is that when "diversity" does come to places like yours, the liberals are the first ones to get the hell out.  Lol.

Strange because when society is given the choice at least when it comes to cryptos, they choose the deflationary one.
@_date: 2015-07-10 10:37:04
Can you give me a link explaining.  Because everything I've read about etns is they do not need to hold the asset.  This is a main difference between etf and etn
@_date: 2015-07-13 00:26:23
Sometimes it's fun to confirm.  Whenever someone is calling for diversity or open borders, see where they live.  Whether it's bernie sanders, or Hillary Clinton, or Tim wise, or SiberianShibe.  Diversity and open borders are awesome.  For everyone else that is!  
@_date: 2015-07-19 22:21:15
5 bucks!  Big spender
@_date: 2015-07-10 10:15:23
No, from what I understand ETNs aren't even required to hold the asset, so I don't see what's good about them in regards to the market.

They don't place an order you wait for someone to buy it for you at the discount you want.  Greater the discount longer it takes.

@_date: 2015-07-10 10:58:06
That's what I figured, but some are making the case that it is backed so don't believe me.  I'm just going by what I've read about etns.  Maybe these are different.

Securing the borders is something all countries do.  Try going into Mexico illegally.  I find it funny that keeping the borders secure from anyone coming in is considered evil and racist.  I don't watch fox but it's obvious you've drank the Marxist Kool aid.  Then again even Marxists weren't dumb enough to leave the borders wide open.
@_date: 2015-07-17 15:04:21
Maybe they make a little on the spread?
@_date: 2015-07-08 15:53:00
Do these etns have any effect on moving the market?  Does money invested eventually lead to buying btc off the exchanges?  If not then how is this good?
@_date: 2015-07-18 12:41:27
Shhh.  Don't tell them

Everyone on the bitcoin space should download the get gems app.  Its a messaging app like whatsapp or telegram but comes with a bitcoin wallet built in.  You are rewarded for referring friends and advertisers will pay users to see messages from them.  Gems is the in app currency, which runs on counterparty, which runs on bitcoin.  Makes sending btc or gems as easy as clicking their name.

So when immigrants are found with expired visas should they be deported?  What would Mexico do?  What would your hero's homeland of Israel do? Fun questions.  We''ll just ignore the fact that you as an expert on racism and diversity chose to live as far away as possible from it.  Lol
