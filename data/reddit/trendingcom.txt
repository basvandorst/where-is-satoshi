Thanks I'll put this on an old tablet and hang it on my wall. Much easier than rigging something up with Raspberry Pi

This time was not manipulation imo. There were a lot of traders who were looking to enter if the 9100 low held. As soon as there were signs that it was going to hold, shorts started covering and bulls started buying. Since bulls and bears were both buying, and no one was selling at this point, the price rose rapidly.

I've been trading domain names for over 17 years and based on the name alone this does not seem like a spoof. ZB.com is worth around a million or more.

We use it to pay affiliate marketers for their traffic. It's crushing Western Union.

Flat top and higher lows = ascending triangle. The dips are becoming shallower as buyers lose patience when looking for an entry.

Yesterday we sent payments and the average fee was 64 cents. The fee really is a non-issue for us, but I can see it being an issue for any business that does micro transactions. For now, Bitcoin is the language all affiliate marketers speak that want to be paid by crypto. Maybe some of them take the Bitcoin and buy other alt coins with it, but the requests to be paid by another coin is very low / non-existent right now. However if we start seeing requests for Litecoin, it'll be a no brainer for us to offer that too.

Google can only send money to those with a bank account which leaves out billions of people. I believe it would be in their own best interest to offer Bitcoin as a payment method.

Affiliate marketing is a $4B a year industry. We use it to pay clients for their web and mobile traffic no matter where they live.  Next best is western union with high fees and a 15 minute process to send or a wire transfer that costs $20 to send and takes days to reach their bank. Doesn't matter to us if BTC is worth $1 USD or $20,000 USD, clients don't care either, it's the best way to transfer wealth whatever the value may be at any time.

This is certainly true in the affiliate marketing space. More and more of our Indian publishers (clients) are changing their payment preference from PayPal to Bitcoin. Main reason is that PayPal has been known to ban Indian clients for very strange reasons and there is little recourse.

For our affiliate marketing business, we accept Bitcoin for payment to buy ad space and we also pay Bitcoin to websites who serve those same ads.
We have never had an issue where someone sent Bitcoin to the wrong address or paid under the amount owed. 
In all cases, those paying with Bitcoin understand Bitcoin.

For our affiliate ad network, we’re seeing an increase of website publishers who are requesting Bitcoin as a payment method for their web traffic. When it was at $500 we had 0 requests for Bitcoin.

1st idea: Buy Bitcoin stickers and create a sticky that anyone can receive free stickers upon request. We can have a contest to see who can create the best sticker designs then another contest for the best placed stickers in public places.
2nd idea: Host a contest to find the best idea to educate India on the benefits of Bitcoin then use the funds to support that initiative.

Daily chart is an ascending triangle pattern. This basically means the dips are becoming less and less until the price hits the apex of the triangle and has nowhere to move, that is when it breaks out of the pattern. DYOR Google ascending triangle to learn more about it and then look at the pattern on the daily chart.
