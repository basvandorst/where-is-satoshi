Hey - I've updated the app to allow for choosing between a few different price sources (GDAX, Blockchain.info, Coinbase, Coindesk and the aggregator CryptoCompare)
If you have others you'd like added (which offer free APIs) shoot them my way

Well spotted, it doesn't. Xamarin decided to add it by default.
It'll be gone in the next release ��

Updated the app with additional currencies, including Ringgit :)

Cheers :)

Glad you like it!

Cheers :) There's a toggle at the top of the "add transaction" page, which will switch between adding and removing bitcoin in exchange for fiat (or at least estimated value in fiat). Is that what you mean?
@_date: 2017-10-14 12:38:22
I guess you could either enter 0 fiat, or an approximate value of the purchase?
@_date: 2017-10-14 19:46:09
Fixed! Update is live
@_date: 2017-10-14 12:23:28
I'll look into it - doesn't look like Bitcoin.org's API supports it, but I could set up a conversion when I have time. Cheers

Oops, looks like there's a bug in the scroll view, I'll put a patch out tonight ��

Ah yeah I wrote it haphazardly yesterday, that'll be a casting issue. I'll get it fixed :)
Not sure what you meant by sources?  Edit: brain farted, ignore me
@_date: 2017-10-14 07:38:31
Source is on GitHub: 
@_date: 2017-10-14 12:21:33
Nothing in there yet, but I can look into adding it when I get some time :)
