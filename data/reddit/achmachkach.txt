So how much do you try keep in ur wallet 
@_date: 2017-10-16 15:24:29
The fees are too high for me I might just get my broski to set up a coinbase

You're right but I'm wondering if there is anything smarter I could do with this. Should i just save fiat or dump it all in crypto which is risky as fuck.  I pride myself on being able to save my money and make it as many ways a day I can so I'm trying to make the best decision for my future

I have like $300 cash atm and have no idea how to get it into bitcoin. I'll try as many ways as possible but it's either I spend a third of the money on crypto or make a little bitcoin fund and save up a little bit but I'm worried it's pointless if it goes up I'd be spending a bunch of money pointlessly do u think it will dip again? And any ways to turn cash to bitcoin?

Seems reasonable I guess thanks man I'll try save up a little bitcoin fund 
@_date: 2017-10-16 15:50:48
Thanks I'll give it a look

Doesn't coinbase need  verification? I'm underage lol oh and do you think one of those prepaid visas or Mastercards would work?
@_date: 2017-10-13 17:21:52
Yeah this sort of reminded me why I haven't invested in a while, I surpassed the no verification limit on coincorner and have no idea what else to do

I don't know in 5 years i was expecting maybe $500?

Can just tell you got a silver spoon nevertheless it's a smart decision good luck bro

I said I invested 200 but my prediction would be it growing to 500
