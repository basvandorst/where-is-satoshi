I disagree. Most people think of capitulation as one giant, red candle on a chart. In reality, capitulation is a process. Everyone gets ground down by the grueling bear market. Judging by all the recent polls, in which the vast majority of respondents think new lows are coming, I'd say we're already bottomed out.
It looks even more promising that we've risen after a spate of bad news.

I started GPU mining in 2011. I ended up selling everything during a double digit ATH later on. It's easy to look back and say that was stupid, but no one really had any idea then. At this point it looks inevitable that bitcoin will triumph, but prior to 2014 or so, it was basically an obscure economics/computer science experiment. I also know tons of people who lost hundreds or thousands of bitcoins through various scams, hacks, etc. 
I've accumulated since then. I don't have as many as I used to, but at least I'm a true hodler now. After seeing, first hand, all the ups and downs, scams and hacks, FUD and crashes, I have an iron hand and am not flustered.
