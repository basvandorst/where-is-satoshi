I used to live in Venezuela, where we got free electricity, after realizing how bad bitmain manufacture these boards, of 20 antminers after warranty was over half of the miners were broken/partial functional.. what a waste of money. after year and half i finally ROI.. and thats with free electricity!!
@_date: 2017-12-23 19:17:43
Exactly! Bitcoin != Blockchain... People need to accept that bitcoin tech is staying behind.. Compared to other cryptos.. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 18:03:14
Unpopular opinion here... Bitcoin is bad for the enviroment

Bittrex charge you 0.001 which is 19 usd Today. 
@_date: 2016-01-28 05:50:23

What if, they gout out of business and then my ledger breaks down, is there a way to recover with the seed?
@_date: 2017-08-30 23:26:02
I agree... 
@_date: 2019-08-14 15:53:41
Im pretty sure merchants are in BitPay because it automatically transfer the funds to FIAT in your bank account and they do not need to worry if the price of BTC goes DOWN or UP.
People keep recommending BTCPayServer but that is a different solution.
I'm againts BitPay, but like it or not they provide a service no-one else is providing.

Whatever redditor for 7 weeks....
@_date: 2017-11-08 08:03:43
Haha shit man, relax, do some yoga. Calm yourself. We get it you defend 100% BTC, but he has the right to post his opinion.. When did your opinion become the real truth of the world? 
@_date: 2019-06-21 11:47:25
oh man.. that comment made my day.
@_date: 2019-02-10 00:29:52

@_date: 2017-11-19 10:00:50

The problem is that when mempool starts getting filled (100k+ tx) the miners will have preference on higher fees... If the mempool was like one week ago you would still be waiting 
@_date: 2017-11-19 11:14:29
Whatever you say redditor for 6 weeks
@_date: 2019-02-22 11:47:15
I think you are the only one laughing at this lame meme hahaha
@_date: 2017-11-19 09:28:14
Is it posible to make bitcoin less vulnerable to these kind of attack? 
@_date: 2019-04-05 18:17:07
This is the childest comment i have ever read in my life. 
@_date: 2019-04-05 19:53:19
Loving it so far. 
@_date: 2019-04-12 14:27:44
I mined in a country where electricity is free (Venezuela)
After breaking even.. 40% of my miners had hardware issues.. (Bitmain)
Thats lame.
@_date: 2018-11-08 11:12:50
It is not about how good the platform is, is about that it allows venezuelans to exchange money there.. every exchange that has been opened in Venezuela has to close because legal issues.
@_date: 2018-11-19 09:00:54
You typed the address manually, looked up where the exchange is located, did the math. so funny that you didn't look the price 4 days ago because lazyness
@_date: 2018-02-10 07:54:26
Holy shit, that was my thinking... People Who loved BTC in december were hating it last week.. Its like everybody do it to create a massive FUD.. So they can buy lower..

- Yahoo was first... Then Google 
- Apple was first... Then Microsoft 
- MySpace was first.. Then Facebook 
- MSN was first... Then whatsapp
Thats does not mean anything 
@_date: 2019-01-27 17:32:53
I tried to do that but i don't see an "instructions" place. You left an email or what. 
@_date: 2017-09-13 15:43:02
Hehe... Right? Tech is not important at all.. The world does not evolve.. If we all think like you we should all use Iphones because it was the first smartphone and all the Samsungs, HTC, Pixels, Sony are just smartphone clones..
Again.. Im not against BTC.. I hold BTC..... But im not blindfolded to think is the only possible coin able to succed
@_date: 2017-09-20 07:19:27
Well goverment spend millions on wars don't they? 
@_date: 2017-09-15 12:06:21
Hahaha lol
@_date: 2017-09-13 14:05:18
Nahh.. I hold BTC.. im just not a die hard fan.. Im not blindfolded
@_date: 2017-09-13 16:45:55
I agree with your comment. What i don't agree is people calling other altcoins fake, like if the developers of bitcoins are the only ones capable of developing a coin.. 
@_date: 2017-09-13 13:21:23
So you are telling me bitcoin devs are the only ones in the world that are able to bring updates and bug fixes to a platform..
Sorry.. But thats not an good point..
The POW of bitcoin makes the world spend millions in electricty while other coins save energía with POS..
So many flaws.. You can be a die hard fan of BTC all you want, that does not change the fact that other coins can perform better than btc.. Btc is huge because it was the first... Thats it.. 
@_date: 2017-09-13 15:18:16
Well man.. I asked what feature btc has over other coin.. The fact that a lot people use it doesnt mean that...
Everybody uses USD as a reference all over the world.. Does it mean USD is the winner of the world? Ehmmm no. 
@_date: 2017-10-18 07:07:36
When you mean adopted? You mean it as a mean of investment or as a payment system? Because the core team hasn't solved how to compete with visa or mastercard when we talk about tx / s... How can we expect to get it adopted if it takes 40 minutes to make a tx
@_date: 2017-10-17 09:13:36
I am a Venezuelan.... My main concern is that using crypto is not as easy.. it took 6 months to my mom to learn how to use the banking website.. imagine if i have to explain her that she has to go into localbitcoin.. 2fa... bitcoin address.. confirmations.. fees.. rates.. thats not for the common user....
The other concern is CRIME.. people already kill you for stealing your wallet in Venezuela.. imagine if they know you have magical bitcoins in your phone... they just put a gun to your head and say transfer it to this wallet or i kill you... and yes... they will kill you...
this is not going to work as a payment system for venezuela
@_date: 2017-09-13 12:23:00
Bitcoin does not have anything special.. If you look at the tech behind it.. Others coin offer better things.. Just name me one thing bitcoin does that other coin cant do..? 
@_date: 2017-10-17 14:55:43
Venezuela is in another level man... All my family and friends have been robbed at least once, i don't know anyone who hasn't been robbed (with a gun ofc)
@_date: 2017-09-15 12:06:21
Hahaha lol
@_date: 2016-05-09 23:46:31
I wonder why they havent tried this. 
@_date: 2019-05-07 10:14:49


Isn't laundering money the other way around? he does not have clean money, having BTC is like having cash, you still need to launder it. isn't to launder money to have it on your bank account and goverment knows is clean money of yours?
