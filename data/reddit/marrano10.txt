The main factor is need. Let me explain it in fiat terms, lets say you have a super volatile fiat coin like the venezuelan bolivar, and one that is not as volatile like the USD. If you are living in Venezuela but your savings are in USD, you dont want to spend them as much because every day you can get more Bolivars per USD but the ammount of stuff that you ca actually buy remains the same but at higher price. In this situation of course you can live out of USD but as everything is priced on regards to the bolivar you would want to spend only as much as you need.       I know this example is refering to inflation and Forex markets but I believe my point is still valid.

That always happen I was furious when I bought at $1300 and went dow to $900 and same when I bought again at 3k....   It is always a part of the rollercoaster. When there is a hype there usalluy is a small correction for about 2 days and then back up again

Prices are determined by demand and offer (bid and ask) prices, these of course depend in at what price point is people willing to buy/sell diferent people have different tollerances to risk and different price objectives. that is why prices differ on different exchanges.  You can capitalize on this by use of arbirage(buying where it is cheap and selling where it is expensive. This ussualy requires either transporting your coins from one place to another or to have accounts in two different exchanges. check r/BitcoinMarkets
