you think the article is lying about him having investments in Greyscale?

it doesn't actually give its users that Bitcoin. It sells its users paper bitcoin. Basically GBTC buys Bitcoin, then allows its users to by paper shares of their total pool. 
That is why GBTC sells for a premium over regular bitcoin. Otherwise people would be arbitraging it.

the biggest problem with GBTC is that its a closed garden selling paper Bitcoin and prevents the price of Bitcoin from going up. 
If only the investors here bought actual Bitcoin instead of a Bitcoin derivative...

WRONG! This is a better explanation:

your post history says otherwise.

they have a much smaller pool than the total pool. They dont have to divide 21 Million bitcoins. 
They divide 1% of bitcoin among their super wealthy clients. 
imagine having 1 bitcoin and selling 100 Million shares of paper bitcoin. The price of that Bitcoin would be a lot higher.
When GBTC launched, it launched at the same price as regular Bitcoin. They launched years ago, so they have tons of clients that are able to sell at any time.
Trump is one of those clients.

Hex offers Trustless interest. Just you and an Ethereum Smart Contract. No worrying about an exit scam.

Hex has built in inflation. So the ROI is in hex coin itself. But the inflation only goes to people who stake their coins and take them off the market, which drives up the price. But if the price goes up a lot and you want to stop staking and start selling, if you end your stake early, you get hit with penalties like in a bank Time Deposit.
