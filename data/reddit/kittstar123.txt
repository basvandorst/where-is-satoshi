He already did. It was disgusting

I don’t doubt that Bitcoin will go back up, but I feel bad for him paying double as much as he could right now
@_date: 2017-12-02 01:40:50
Warning NSFL, I was legitimately scarred. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 20:51:22
Yes, he replied to this post
@_date: 2017-11-18 12:20:28
Whew that got dark real fast... can we go back to talking about how you will season your left ball
@_date: 2017-11-18 10:48:22
If Bitcoin falls to $1 in the next week I will cut off my finger and eat the flesh. No bambozzles. All the truths

Hey guys! We did it, Bitcoin is now $10,000! Who cares about the money though, this guy is going to eat his left ball. When I posted this 10 days ago, I was honestly doubtful, but I’m not a fucking idiot so I didn’t bet my left ball against it. u/Calaber24p has responded and you can read his response here:
He seems like he might not come through, but at the very least he will do something. Let’s hope he responds now that it was hit $10000. And I will be trying to contact him to arrange the ceremonial ball eating

That’s not bad...
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:53:50
We did it guys! Somebody give this man gold!

It’s official guys. RumpleForeskin699 reported Bitcoin will fail. We’re doomed 
@_date: 2017-11-18 10:32:27
Haha. I’m surprised that many people saw that ONE comment. Well everyone should make sure to buy so we can see a guy eat his own ball. But....
u/calaber24p I agree with the statement “no spikes” that’s fair. However we want to still see some ball eating. Would you agree to eating a BULL TESTICAL (I hear they are a delicacy) if it hits say... 9000? I will help pitch in to buy the Bull Testical if that is a problem.
@_date: 2017-11-18 19:31:17
@_date: 2017-11-18 03:53:21
that’s exactly what u/calaber24p would say
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:56:59
Haha. No.
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:57:41
Mods! Can we please ban anybody who tries to convince him not too. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 09:08:41
Why stop there? Have it hit $400,000 so you can buy **2** Tesla Roadsters
@_date: 2017-11-18 03:04:35
Oh boy...
@_date: 2017-11-18 08:03:19
In most countries, however some like China have banned trade on it. Bitcoin can be spent on a good amount of things, such as Reddit Gold, gift cards, reeds, overstock, Expedia, and Newegg.
@_date: 2017-11-18 07:14:37
I really can’t wait. I will give him gold if he actually eats it in a video. I will probably also cut out my eyes afterwards from how gross it is
@_date: 2017-11-18 04:52:35
I love this reply. Everyone else is getting silverware and then there’s this comment
@_date: 2017-11-18 20:03:14
Oh lol. I didn’t see that at first, thanks for explaining
@_date: 2017-11-18 08:03:53
I don’t think that’s how it works...
@_date: 2017-11-09 03:44:13
Both sound good. Do you think I would find a hard time finding books about the first topic? Only asking because I’ve never heard of the  Segwit2x
@_date: 2017-11-18 10:56:12
Yes he is.
@_date: 2017-11-18 08:17:07
This is Bitcoin not lite coin, give me gold. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:15:17
@_date: 2017-11-18 02:42:10
I’m very curious to see if he first cuts the ball off and then eats it, or if he has the flexibility to bite it off... ahh what a time to be alive
