Need a price index that's accurate and derives it's price from over 50 exchanges instead of just 4? 
As for LakeBTC - they might be working on their API. Last bid is showing $1000 USD so something is off. Lake btc makes up less than 9% of BTC-CNY trading volumes.
@_date: 2014-10-15 12:40:51
Pretty much the exact same thing with lamassu except delivery took 6 months. Still sitting in origional crates now almost 10 months later. 
@_date: 2014-10-08 20:23:37
Here's some interesting metrics we published about this: 
@_date: 2014-12-31 00:52:16
You will find that 86 difference exchanges will result in 98% of them not giving you what your after. 
What are you trying to achieve here?
If you are after a global average bitcoin price, you need to ping every single exchange otherwise you end up with 'regional' prices.
This is what we do and the API we offer. It took months of work and we roll mountains more data into our Price-Index than the next guys (bitcoin average). 
We have created 'market specific' API's for those that wanted just an average for say USD trading, or CNY only markets average. 
We can also have a global consolidated orderbook but this would be about 50% of the market as not all exchanges offer orderbook info. This API would cost a small fortune to compile and maintain. 
If you haven't noticed already, half the exchanges out there have their API's powered by a potato. And the other half don't know how to make a decent API. 
So we had to spend a lot of time writing software that basically takes 86 API's and turns them into a standardized format before we feed it back into our other software which churns out a global weighted average. 
As for streaming type TCP socket API's - unless there is a clear need for it, it's not on our roadmap as most people are fine with getting data in a json format. 
@_date: 2014-10-26 11:31:42
They gather API data from 4 exchanges to show you an 'average' price of bitcoin. These exchanges often spit out bad data and it seems their charting doesn't pick it up so hence the spike.
If you want a bitcoin price index that not only, never goes down, but also includes 50+ exchanges not just 4....
 
@_date: 2014-02-23 09:12:17
+100 reddcoins
@_date: 2014-04-08 03:36:42
Our vision is to collect and display ALL of the data in a true form and outline methodology transparently - we have the staff and resources to 'keep on top of it' as coins are added and removed from exchanges + other factors. We want to be THE index for all Crypto. Hence "home of Crypto"
This is why our Bitcoin Price represents the market more accuratly than other indexes - because 4 exchanges don't represent 99.9 % of traded BTC in ALL fiat currencies.
+ we will offer a price index and rich data in such fine details for ALL reputable or notable Alts coins! - Boom!
This is is all Phase 1 - Much much more coming under phase 2 &amp; 3:
- The IOS &amp; Android versions are also already in-development.
- Personal Portfolio Manager
- Accountancy Software plug-ins
- Embeddable price tickers
- EPIC EPIC EPIC data-visualization ideas
- Research (We will have all the data - think about it)

Lake BTC last bid: $1000.00	Last Ask: $351.78
Lake BTC only made up 8.38% of the BTC-CNY market today. 
Looks like a small volume traded for $1000 USD.

This story from Tone Vays (coin Telegraph) shows how obscure the Bit License would be if tried in 1994 when the Internet started booming.
Here's the BraveNewCoin.com Summary:
**If BitLicense was IntLicense (20 years ago)**
*Who it effects:*
  *  Department Commerce &amp; Telecommunications to have oversight and act as regulator.
  * Bloggers, journalists, website owners, posters of comments - or anybody writing anything online requires to have a IntLicense
  *  Requires the Establishment of a 'central repository' for all content - for government review and approval.
  *  The Authority can give License Exemption to anybody,... like WSJ or TIME if they feel like it. 
*Applying for the license*
* Requires Full list of names in the company, and full background checks on all Company Benefactors, including, ID, finger-print, CV, a personal financial summary on each person, 2 pints of blood, your dignity &amp; a piece of your soul submitted directly to the FBI.
*  Explanation of how you will use the Internet
*  Demonstration that you can comply with the lengthy regulatory requirements around using the Internet. 
*   90 Days to decide to approve a license, 10 days to revoke if they feel your bad 'at internet'.
*Using the internet*
*   You must maintain a minimum amount of content to use the Internet.
*   Any unused internet can only be spent on government issued internet at end of financial year.
*   You must have a back-up supply of government approved internet. 
*   You must submit a written plan every-time you stop posting on reddit and start posting on facebook.
*   You must go through the whole license application if you want your grandma to use your internets.
*   You must store all your internet history and activity for 10 years
*   You must send all your Internets to the Nintendo 45 days prior to close of each quarter for review. 
*   You must know your reader's readers, re-posters and re-tweeters like you know your Spouse or children. 
*   You must chisel in stone the photo IDs of anybody who uses your Internets 
*   You must maintain a Chief Internets Office on your payroll at all times. 
*   You must have a Troll plan, in-case somebody posts naked pictures of Ben Lawsky, surrounded by naked clowns, through your interwebs. - maybe this one's gone too far? But you get the ridicioulus nature of the Proposed Bit License don't you!

Guys.... This is costing me over 175k to put together.
$350 - $450 per ticket to a two day conference, where you get fed a buffet lunch each day, and get to hear the best economists, VC's, Entrepreneurs in Bitcoin, Regulators from NZ government, Pro-Bitcoin Lobbyists, Writers &amp; Singers releasing works over blockchain tech, Accountants familiar with NZ/AUS/US Tax laws, The best Financial Compliance Lawer in NZ + 450 other Business owners or senior managers to network with......
Its a bargain.
A speciality conference of this calibre is typically 750-1000 NZD.
The Inside Bitcoin series events are $450 - $800+
European Bitcoin Confs are $500 - $2000 NZD each. 
Its a bargain... I priced it low to make it affordable. 
Write it off on tax, Ask your boss to pay for it to upskill yourself, mine some altcoins, do what you need to do. But don't compare it to a 20-dude meetup in somebody's dunedin basement.
Not trying to sound like a smart arse but I'm putting alot of effort and money into this conference and stand to make a decent loss.
The project is being run to drive adoption in NZ. 
I've personally written to over 75 CEO's and sent them a copy of the latest yBitcoin Magazine with a letter explaining why BlockChain Technology is something they will regret not learning about early on - and to send a senior rep. 
We need the innovators &amp; doers of NZ to understand how powerful this trustless system is.
Imagine the guys behind flybuys attending and going 'wow - we could put our entire reward program on a blockchain' and safe a trillion dollars in admin and maintenance fees &amp; headaches = 6 months later FlybuysCoin. 
This is the innovation that NZers are known for and should drive in the Bitcoin Space.

Hey guys
We are deep in development around this one.
At Bravenewcoin.com we have the best market data anywhere for bitcoin and many Altcoins.
All we need to know is your transaction amount and date - this then gets matched up against the price of BTC in whatever your local currency is from our data - to reconcile into your accounting.
Products we are rushing to get out:
1) Accounting plug-ins: Allowing you to send invoices out in BTC or import Bitcoin transactions into your existing accounting package. 
2) Portfolio Manager: Plug in your public keys and our software will match it against the values on the transaction dates to profit/loss + dozens of detailed reports like you would with traditional portfolio management tools. 
3) Invoicing Service (which can sync with  or  
This is a page we are contemplating setting up which offers 2 items:
 A) - put in your TransX ID and email address + receipt info - the system will generate a TAX receipt displaying what was paid by who &amp; to who, the values in BTC and any Fiat you choose, date stamped etc -
B) Again a page but in reverse to the above- where you request payment- put in details, invoice is generated, once paid auto-receipt is issued.
Like a Crypto specific mini invoicing system which can reconcile via plug-ins to other accounting software. 
These services will probably live on bitcoin.info and there will be a secure, universal log-in between bravenewcoin and bitcoin.info
We are looking for extra developers to finish off certain items. 
We are also looking for people to help us get this right by joining user-focus groups (as much as I hate corporate babble, these are useful to get products right).
PM if you wish to get more info in the future.
