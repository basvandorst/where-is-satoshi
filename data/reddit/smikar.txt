In my opinion, this approach has two major drawbacks:
i) The pre-generated transactions won't be able to transfer bitcoins that credited the wallet after they were generated, so it seriously limits the use cases.
ii) You need to secure the pre-generated transaction + the key of the emergency address, which adds a potential security breach.

i) The public key associated to an address is only exposed if the address was used for an outgoing transaction. If the NSA were able to break ECC, they would still not be able to attack unused addresses. Best case, they could attempt to double spend your legitimate transaction when you move the funds to another address but this is another story. This is one reason why you shouldn't use the same address for change.
ii) The Bitcoin protocol is flexible enough to change the signature scheme if required. One possibility would be to move to a quantum-proof algorithm (but old and used addresses would still be vulnerable).
iii) They are probably (dozen of) years away from building any useful quantum computer. If they manage to do it secretly, I think Bitcoin will be the last of our concern.

Please give me an invite, I'm looking forward to trying your services. Thank you!

It is still very weak unless you perform a lot of iterations and your pass phrase has sufficient entropy.
Hashing iteratively does not add entropy, it only makes it a little bit slower (linearly) for the attacker to attack your key.
What you suggest is actually the poor version of what is called a Key Derivation Algorithm, and the one you propose is close to PBKDF2. If the number of iterations is very high, it becomes an effective way of fighting against brute-force and other-of-the-kind attacks. However, it is not very resilient as it gets weaker and weaker as chips get more powerful; also, such an algorithm is highly parallelizable, which makes it extremely vulnerable if the pass phrase lacks entropy.
Better designs can be achieved using memory-hard key derivation functions such as Scrypt but there is no magic here: you still need a high-entropy pass phrase, which is kind of hard to achieve for human brain.

I did, at $800.

IMHO, it is not possible unfortunately.
edit: they seem to provide the whole source code though:

You can intercept the block, and in fact, you do. But the 25BTC block reward points to the address of the actual miner of the block so if you wanted to benefit from this interception, you would have to change the address -- and thus start the proof of work from scratch.

Great news! Have you heard about NBitcoin? It is a full implementation in .NET too and is pretty impressive.
@_date: 2013-11-23 21:56:05
Thank you for the link. I am in Switzerland. I did not attend Bitcoin meetups myself yet but friends of mine do.
@_date: 2013-11-23 20:04:09
Good idea, a law-compliant mixing service + storage. Your second point is interesting too, but as you say, I think it is too early as they aren't enough trustworthy exchanges around the world. Any other idea?
@_date: 2013-11-23 20:33:03
I did not say heavyweights, I cannot confirm neither deny your guess :-)
I share your opinion concerning an exchange run by a bank, that is why I mentioned the idea here. Are there many people that would consider quitting bitstamp if such an exchange got real?
Excellent point for the ATMs.

Thank you for your advices. Yes, I have personal interests in the matter and they'll probably hire me as an consultant if they go further in this direction.
I have been working for them in the past while developing some bitcoin-related project, which got me this "bitcoin-expert" nickname. I had the chance to get closer to the management recently as they are getting requests from their clients and need to know more about the tech. I'll introduce the technology to them and share my views on the multiple opportunities there is in this market segment. I think I have good chances to convince them that it is worth taking the risk now.

Depending on your needs, there are multiple definitions of the volatility:
i) either use a rolling window and compute the vol on each subsample
ii) or estimate some conditional volatility model such as a GARCH and consider the contemporaneous volatilities
iii) when option market gets more liquid, use forward-looking estimates such as implied volatility or the VIX (from a cross section of options).
Then you could for instance regress some parametric function and test the sign of the slope. I doubt you find anything interesting at this stage though.
@_date: 2013-11-23 18:31:24
I understand you are skeptical. I wouldn't have any interest in writing here if that weren't true, though.
@_date: 2013-11-23 17:05:49
Can you please elaborate?
@_date: 2013-11-23 16:55:35
Early December.
@_date: 2013-11-23 21:08:32
Thank you for the references, looks very interesting I'll investigate tomorrow.
@_date: 2013-11-23 16:53:51
Unfortunately, I cannot reveal this information.
@_date: 2013-11-23 17:22:00
It is a wild guess, but I think they would rather invest in an in-house project. I know they are considering the technology seriously, my job will be to convince them there is money to make in this market segment. I think it would be great for the Bitcoin community if a bank gets its hands dirty and jumps into the technology -- this is why I'm willing to come with as many arguments as possible :-)
@_date: 2013-11-23 19:01:51
Well, this one is true. I'd be happy to reveal my identity if it did not disclose the name of the bank at the same time.
To answer your first remark: I do not need random comments or suggestions. My initial post is indeed too vague.
I have been giving multiple talks about bitcoin already (in part. at university). I have no doubt I'll convince the management that bitcoin is great and that there are some huge opportunities now. What I need is your advices about the best direction they should take, both for their own interest and the bitcoin community.
For instance, I am wondering whether I should argue in favor of building a bank-grade bitcoin exchange - or if there is already too much competition coming.

I did not know about neobee, excellent point, thank you.
@_date: 2013-11-23 20:18:26
To be honest, I am no expert about colored coins and did not follow the recent advances. I read that implementing colored coins on top of the btc specification is quite hard; are there promising implementations today? Please elaborate :-) 
@_date: 2013-11-23 21:03:11
I agree with you and this is part of the suggestions I already planned. I already have all I need for the growth / potential talk, with all kinds of parabolic figures and 3-digit growth numbers :-)

I agree that an insured wallet would be very useful. However, I guess the premium would be very high as it would be hard for the insurer to know if the insured really lost the funds or just sent them to a new address. If it is only a matter of protecting the funds against loss, I think there are more efficient ways of doing it: the bank could just store some kind of backup copy of the wallet. What do you think?
@_date: 2013-11-23 21:00:31
Well, I used to arbitrage myself with a home-made bot. Made some money, until bitcoin24 shut down with my funds, mtgox failed to send me the cash back on time, bitcoin-central closed, etc. I think the risk of such a strategy is too high.
@_date: 2013-11-23 20:39:10
Investing in bitcoin is a risky in itself for a bank (just think about the reputation risk, for inst.), I prefer not arguing in favor of even more risk.
