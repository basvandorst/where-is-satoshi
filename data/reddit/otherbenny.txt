Yes the non-2FA wallet is less secure. However if you would like, you can easily create a new Segwit 2FA-enabled wallet using Electrum and move your money there where it will be safe and transactions will be cheaper!

That was my thought too.  I know it's not the popular opinion around here but it seems like BitcoinCash is the way to go after doing more reading but just can't get the hash power behind it.  Do you believe there is anyway that it overtakes BTC?  I know segwit is a little while off but it's not a guarantee that it will be activated like everyone says. Even then 2MB doesn't seem like a lot though.  
I do agree that it is the way of the future but which version is the way of the future?  That's what I'm trying to discern.  What makes you think that BTC is going to be the dominant coin over BCC/BCH moving forward?  I am genuinely curious!
Thank you for your input mate.

I've got an apple watch, how is this possible?

I actually created a spreadsheet for this specific purpose.  Can confirm comment above is accurate for figuring that out. 
The sheet calculates your PnL and % made.  It definitely comes in handy in a day to day basis for knowing where you stand. 
I may be able to send you it on Google drive if you want, just DM me.

Interesting because my security system (ESET) and it hasn't alerted me of that. It warns me of mining applications/scripts but hasn't warned me of Coinpot. I couldn't find anything online about it either.

I'm genuinely interested in why you say that. I've been using them on my computer for probably 8 months now for moon faucets and haven't experienced any problems but if thats true I will stop using it.
