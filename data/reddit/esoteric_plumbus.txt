It's a tiny bit different, I could get $20 on the spot at 2:00 am in the morning with circle but with the banks you have to physically go to them and fill out a form and are restricted to when they are open

Also I wonder how that will play into evil morty, cuz morty was ready to kill Rick (accidentally) in the standoff and now Rick is getting dark and ruining his family and forcing morty to go on adventures? Will morty rebel?

Well you see the title said he was doing a bit of reading, and the picture was in a library so I was like oh good for him, it's great to read. It wasn't till pointed out the book he was holding did I notice it was a book about bitcoin. Fancy that!

Haha I'm really curious why I'm banned, I truly have no idea, I never really post here q:
@_date: 2016-10-09 18:47:00
It was a euphemism, but yeah you already basically conveyed that point. But you act as if that immediately removes the possibility of all other outcomes. Yeah maybe that's happened but it doesn't detract from the fact that violence in general has been reduced.
@_date: 2017-05-26 18:28:59
It's sound advice really
I was gonna post this on my oldest account as a joke but I found out I'm banned here on that one for some reason lol
@_date: 2016-10-08 22:23:24
Yeah that's what the op was talking about but you were talking how markets today aren't cutting down on violence and to use sr as a example just shows how far removed you are from the entire thing, which gives no validity to your argument 
@_date: 2016-10-09 19:23:14

That is the actual case notes with the logs that I linked. My whole point was the chat logs were faked by bad actors who were clearly corrupt (proven by theft of the btc). I couldn't find anywhere that referenced a journal that he kept, unless you meant to say ~~planted~~ chat logs that happened to be saved on his PC
@_date: 2018-12-20 21:26:05
Fair enough
@_date: 2018-12-20 21:50:49
I think you're missing the bigger picture. Yes that's true as long as you believe the investigators are acting in good faith (which is hard to do given the corruption and theft of the btc). What's stopping them from shuffling around btc and proclaiming that it originated from him or the site while fabricating this story? Can you link undeniable proof that the btc originated from him? Or are you trusting that what the FBI is saying is true? 
And if you are saying this was true, why drop the charges altogether? 
@_date: 2018-12-20 21:27:47
Ppl mail him letters and he responds with what he wants to tweet and they do it for him, crazy huh? 
@_date: 2018-12-20 21:18:17
You wanna show exactly where this journal is you are referring to? 
@_date: 2018-12-20 21:20:06


- &gt;None of those murders, it's important to note, seem to have ever taken place. Instead, the five attempted murders-for-hire following the DEA's sting all appear to have been undertaken by a con artist who merely bilked Roberts out of hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-12-21 14:15:04
Just because you anecdotally know good cops doesn't mean the government want trying to cut off the hydra's head and make an example of him. How do you know it was his wallet? Because they told you it was? 
How do you feel about this?  
Almost everything they present as proof is something digital that can be planted or altered to their advantage. The CIA has been known to do political assassinations and other behind the scenes stuff. The government knows they can't stop DNM's so their best course of action is spreading FUD by making an example of him. His sentence is unfair compared to other comparable cases. The murder for hire plot contributed to that but was dropped? That's complete character assassination.

I feel you dude, I've been in it since it was $4 but I've never been much more than a small time trader. Only recently have I made the effort to just put aside 20$ here and there as a secondary savings. Never too late to start! Imo it's really still quite young
@_date: 2018-12-20 20:21:27
Allegedly according to the FBI (who two members of the investigation team just so happened to steal BTC from the site and where later found out) but the charges were dropped all together. 
The proof for the accusation was equivalent to this:
