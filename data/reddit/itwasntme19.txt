bitcoin is no different from fiat currencies. is backed by nothing, value created out of thin air and value grows on sentiment and speculation. we already have cryptos. they're called credit cards
@_date: 2014-06-19 22:08:45
how will this be different than ebay? can someone explain?
@_date: 2014-02-27 02:54:42
but they will
@_date: 2014-02-28 23:17:45
no because they can print all the money they want. can't do that with Bitcoin
@_date: 2014-08-15 04:09:49
lots of us are. ebay is just plain greedy.we should not pay that much to a middle man
@_date: 2014-08-15 02:00:11
too late for eBay really. I refuse to pay their ridiculously high fees and terrible service. don't care if they take any crypto,I refuse to use them

people are coming around bitcoin now. I'm one of them. people will look to diversify and protect their money. and expect many more to get into bitcoin as economies and financial markets go through their overdue "corrections" hard assets and bitcoin will soar in the next couple of years.

I see people treating Bitcoin as a commodity like gold. is mainly used for speculation. it isn't stable enough to be used broadly in businesses and saying "to the moon!" certainly makes people stay away from it. once the period of speculation ends I do see it as being a dominant currency but Bitcoin is in its infancy and as a long way to go(5-7) before it's anything people want it to be

yes. it seems it's nothing more than a ponzi scheme. and it's quickly unraveling as one
@_date: 2014-03-30 03:00:09
so it justifies their horrible business practices? huge profits? profits over costumer satisfaction/service?
@_date: 2014-02-25 17:50:47
it's over fellas. stick with r/gaming. money isn't your thing
@_date: 2014-02-19 06:20:55
careful fellas. that's sleeping with the enemy. I would not trust my bitcoins  on their wallet
@_date: 2014-03-04 22:01:23
what are they going to charge per trade?
@_date: 2014-02-26 18:45:13
MtGox=Service, Bitcoin=Protocol,Government= regulator. you guys made a fine mess of this. not the end of bitcoin, but boy did you give the bankers the ammunition they needed to take over your bits

paypal wasn't the safest when it started
@_date: 2014-03-14 00:00:17
 Well They sure learned fast.
@_date: 2016-01-24 03:42:47
I want my bitcoin on plastic,just like my debit card. that way I can absolutely use it everywhere.
@_date: 2019-08-07 15:35:40
signs of a recession. people fleeing to safe assets.

Bitcoin is going through that "scary" phase that the Pc went through during the late 70's and early 80's. people are still working on things that are too high tech and complex for the average person. they need to work on making it simple for everyone else to use it. once that is achieved,toss that technology to the porn industry and watch what happens.

My bank just hit me again with a $35 overdraft fee. haven't worked in a while and they are just piling up on top of me with more financial burden. well I'm done,closing my bank account  as we speak. Bitcoin is no longer just a payment option. it's the standard for me now.
@_date: 2015-02-28 03:20:17
I'm forced to pay it regardless. When it's sorted, I'll have to fight my bank because they will play dumb and not reverse the overdraft. Haven't used paypal in months and my debit card comes out only to deposit and pay the bills. People agree because they have no other/better choice.
@_date: 2015-02-28 02:12:37
There's a dispute over this charge. Came from paypal for something I didn't order. I still have to pay the fee regardless of what happens. Asshole

the authorities are looking for an individual called "4chan". he's not a suspect,but he's wanted for questioning.
