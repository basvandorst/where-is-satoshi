"AFAIK there will be a reputation system for arbiters in bitsquare in the future."
So I'm still reliant on trusting a third party to trade between someone else? The whole point of bitcoin is to not rely on a third party to transact with someone else.[ That's the point, it's even in the abstract.](


benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending

You either A are covering ass after you made a terrible suggestion or B expected people to not take your statement at face value. While it was a good thought experiment, maybe the best time for something like that isn't directly messaging that to someone who is in full damage control as their exchange burns down around them?

True, I still rely on a third party, but at least the third party I rely on in a centralized exchange also has thousands of other customers; what are the chances that they would run off with my money when they also have the deposits of so many others?

The largest ever single day drop was about 20% IIRC. thats the difference between paying $1.20 for a coke in a vending machine versus $1. Not ideal, but hardly as life changing as you're describing.
There have been currency shocks in the US economic system before as well. As the ecosystem matures the price swings should happen less and less as larger and larger amounts of capital are required to move markets.
EDIT: I double checked. The worst ever intraday drop was Aug 18, 2015 when it fell nearly 30%&lt; 29.15%.
The most large drop in a single day within the last year was Jan 16, 2018 at 18.44%.
Not great, but not as world changing as you make it seem.

If you're living in a situation where a weeks worth of groceries is bank breaking you shouldn't be investing that much in crypto. Bitcoin is a speculative investment. If you're poor, you cannot afford to make speculative investments. It sucks but ultimately being poor is a trap that prevents you from digging out of it. 
My point is that you shouldn't be holding more in Crypto than you can afford to lose, but even in a seemingly worst case scenario you aren't completely blown out from a market downturn.

It is a big difference, I'm not saying it's not, but volatility has been steadily decreasing since Bitcoin was created. And besides, you're net worth should primary be in something other than the cash you use. 6 Month emergency fund, the rest should be invested making you money. If you treat Bitcoin like a speculative investment, you should already know the risks associated with the volatility. If not and you use it for day to day cash purchases, I would hope you don't have more in cash than you can afford to lose.
@_date: 2018-05-14 03:28:53
In terms of a speculative investment with the volatility of bitcoin? Yea not that big of a deal. It's called risk management.

The cost to mine a bitcoin is based on the price of electricity + cost of mining equipment * inverse rate of ASIC chip advancement essentially. You have to pay for the electricity, and the hardware, and since the hardware eventually goes obsolete, you have to calculate that into your cost of mining. Since mining is typically done for profit, the price of a coin can be expressed by the electricity cost + hardware cost * rate of obsolescence, since the price of a coin should never be lower than the cost to mine it.
@_date: 2017-01-27 18:28:04

Crippling is a stretch. The alternatives of sending money are more expensive: Paypal is typically 29 cents + 2.9% or something along those lines, credit cards are around the same.

A maximum of 6% goes to the banks who make up the FED.
@_date: 2018-04-19 14:45:47
It is true though. Banks arent held accountable to loan responsibly when in a downturn, they had their toxic assets bought up by the FED using TARP. The system is perverse in that the systemic risk posed by banks making bad loans is subsidized indirectly by the citizens who have their monetary supply expanded to save these banks. It's corporate welfare on a scale that made Satoshi include it in the genesis block, and to pretend that's not a problem anymore is pretty shortsighted. All it takes is one downturn when the FED balance sheet is still stuffed to the gills.
@_date: 2018-04-19 17:07:20
100% agree, I'm not defending people who can't afford loans, but they aren't the ones who lent out money that's not theirs because they knew if shit hits the fan they'll just get bailed out. The housing crisis wouldn't have happened if those people weren't offered the loans they couldn't afford, and I expect the bankers to be the ones making the smart financial decisions, not some Joe who just wants a nicer house than he can afford.
@_date: 2018-04-19 07:44:23
You do know you can open a bank account where the bank doesn't loan your money right? Go into almost any bank in America and open a safety deposit box. The reason people use Fractional reserve banking is because the depositor gets interest and a relatively safe place to store money, the borrower gets access to credit, and the banker collects premium for providing the service. How do you think loans work exactly if money deposited wasn't being lent out?
If you want to argue that perpetually low interest rates force people into over leveraging to get decent returns and expose themselves to unnecessary risks that's one thing, but saying "lol banking" makes you sound uninformed.

How do you intend to negotiate with someone who's not operating in good faith? Why would anyone believe BU is out to negotiate when they are proposing emergent consensus which is directly at odds with the HK agreement? 


There's no negotiation here. BU is holding Bitcoin hostage by refusing to HF (which they are "super duper serious about guys!" and refusing to uphold their end of the bargain. I've come to terms that this ends in a hard fork, UASF, or a BU concession. There is no negotiating anymore. They are parasites who refuse to do anything but stagnate Bitcoin. 
Maybe I'm wrong, but the balls in their court, even though they enjoy pretending somehow this is core's fault. 
@_date: 2017-05-09 08:42:23
They aren't mining with BU. Look at discovered blocks, there are still BU blocks being mined even though apparently all BU nodes are getting "attacked". How exactly could that work?

You don't think Litecoin has use cases that bitcoin doesn't cover? For small Tx amounts I think it's superior due to the quicker confirm times. I know it's a meme at this point, but a coffee shop would probably prefer LTC over BTC assuming both networks were equal just due to the quicker confirm times. Bitcoin is still king, but for small Tx (under 5$) I don't see how you could argue it's a bad thing. And if/when Segwit is adopted on BTC you can have instant chain swaps between LTC and BTC. 
[Give this a read, maybe it'll change your mind.](

Dude what? You still need to open/close a Lightning Channel with a Tx that has to be confirmed. What exactly do you think LN is, or are you advocating moving Tx to a third party processor using Lightning? If that's the case, why use a crypto to begin with if it still requires a trusted third party?


Once a channel is open, value can be transferred instantly between counterparties, who are exchanging real bitcoin transactions, but without broadcasting them to the bitcoin network.
So if I want a coffee, I have to have opened a channel before hand with the company is what you're saying, on the off chance I want a coffee? That doesn't seem inconvenient to you? LN will not solve small Tx problems. 
@_date: 2017-05-19 02:08:39
Moving Tx off chain = less fees.
Segwit fixes ASIC boost. 
@_date: 2017-05-21 00:27:51
How though? Lightning requires you to have opened a channel before hand to transact instantly. Do I have to open channels with anyone I think I might have to send BTC to in the future on the off chance I might need it? LN use case is heavy use P2P transfers; think exchange volume moved off chain. It's not going to help small one time transfers at all.
@_date: 2017-05-13 16:39:30


That's the crux of it. Why would they exactly? The have an advantage currently over anyone else trying to mine. Why would they give up monopolistic control willingly?

@_date: 2017-05-06 07:19:04


Oh fuck off. Miners want their cake and to be able to eat it to. They want increased network centralization (BU) and they want to be the only ones to be able to mine competitively (ASIC Boost), while preventing users from performing a UASF. The deck is already stacked in their favor, and now they want to push it even further.


What compromise? Core already proposes 2mb hard fork after segwit addresses transaction malleability. What exactly have miners compromised on at all exactly? They've been advocating for a HF while pushing faulty code that only incentives themselves.

Holy shit you can't actually be this dense can you? You do know people pay for sand, right? It's primary limiting cost is transportation, not cost of acquisition.

What does supply have anything to do with it other than you not understanding ratios?
