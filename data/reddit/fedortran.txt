It would be ironic to impose "rules" and "regulations" since the whole POINT of bitcoin is that it's decentralized, free of regulations.
Advertising bitcoin brings new business to bitcoin! I tell people on other sites such as youtube, "purchase your next item with bitcoin!"
Edit: You can hate all you want but you just make it obvious you're jealous you didn't think to make the subreddit first. Not making you a mod, sorry bud.

it's just a new way to talk about bitcoin! smaller community, better discussion since it's intended for smart individuals, not just average people :)

What do you think it could be? Can you guess from how the word sounds what it might mean? If you sound it out, one letter at a time, how does it sound? What does the sound mean to you?
