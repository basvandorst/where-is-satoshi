This times 1000. Journalists by default aren’t that smart, yet people believe everything they write (edit), in garbage, poorly sources and researched articles.

That’s like saying amazon was behind the curve compared to Ebay. 
There is no curve in this situation. A cryptocurrency better than bitcoin can be created. It probably won’t be created by a government, but acting as if anything after bitcoin is useless because it’s behind the curve is silly

This is one of my favorite fallacies. The idea that in a shtf scenario it would be so bad that there is no trading or stability at all. It ignores much of world history. 
It’s an easy way to not think about something

Gotcha, if something like that happens, I don’t see anything really making a difference.

I misread your post then. I thought you meant “behind the curve” compared to bitcoin, but it seems you meant compared to other countries

The problem here is the world you envision doesn’t need Bitcoin. Any crypto-currency and likely a future, currently uncreated coin will be used.

Over 50% of the replies to me are this exact comment. I always knew most people were unoriginal, but it still consistently amuses me.

Thanks but that didn’t answer my question

This isn’t true. Demand doesn’t work like that. If I go to a party and there are 50 girls. Say 48 are really attractive and two are really unattractive. I won’t demand unattractive girls because they are scarce. They have little value to me in the sense I’d want to date them (harsh, but a good example, don’t repeat in public). 
Bitcoin has no intrinsic value. The people who have already considered and dismissed Bitcoin won’t change their mind because it becomes scarce. They don’t care.

I wonder if bitcoiners will receive the same backlash the NBA did.

Not bad
