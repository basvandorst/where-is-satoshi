But you are still doing exactly that trying to time the bottom range it's not going to work. Why not then wait for some stabilization and if it actually starts trending up then buy. Yeah you won't hit the bottom but you are buying when it's going up not down.

Yeah I get that if you are super confident itll go back up past this point sometime soon then sure keep buying. I for one don't know and if it happens to drop to $500 and start climbing back up I'd rather start buying it then even if I still only pull the trigger at one or 2k. and can always accumulate dips as it rides. 
The point is instead of having the dead money sitting you can accumulate interest at least in anything else while you wait for things to stop going downhill, but I get it if you believe it will suddenly reverse and skyrocket. I guess I just dont see that happening anytime soon.

Sure when line stops trending down it means selling is slowing down or the market is evening our. When the line starts sloping up that's when you buy its basic investing dont catch a falling knife cause you will never catch the bottom. If you really think it's going to suddenly turn around and you're gonna catch the bottom yeah go for it but it wont happen. But yeah I didnt realize waiting for more buyers than sellers is TA yeah I'm obviously just dumb lol. I guess everyone telling me to buy since 10k was clearly correct and I'm stupid for opening the most obvious short of our lifetime. Yeah better to have dead money sitting in something that decreases value month over month for a year+ already.

All shorting is is taking it into debt and buying it back later hopefully for less and returning the loan. I'm sure there are ways
