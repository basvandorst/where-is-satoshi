Exactly ;)

Yes, thanks! I am super paranoid right now as you can imagine...

No, I did not, I only sold a portion, plus I have a number of other crypto currencies. I panic sold when bitcoin fell under $4000 to secure the cash as I needed it for a family matter.

I'm a EU citizen living in the United Kingdom, my plan is to travel throughout the year, hence the question on how best to keep the money untouched
@_date: 2017-08-26 14:24:19
Yep... I am inquiring about an account in Jersey, but I have also considered Andorra or Switzerland, since I live in Europe
@_date: 2017-08-26 16:26:58
haha, I doubt those machines hold that amount of cash!
@_date: 2017-08-26 21:56:55
Just in an electrum wallet
@_date: 2017-08-26 13:24:49
Ha ha that's the idea... I was wondering if I am better off keeping the money offshore and just use use the cash through a foreign credit card linked to that offshore account....

No, I sold a portion of my bitcoins to get around $4M, as I need the money to resolve a family matter involving a purchase of land.

I wished it was that simple! I feel like I'm in an episode of Ozark

I never meant for the question to be about the morality of paying your taxes. More about the practicalities of how to access the cash. 
I would love to hear practical advice from other bitcoin miners that have found themselves in a similar sitiuation 
@_date: 2017-08-26 13:21:47
And what if I want to avoid that altogether? Maybe keep the money offshore?
