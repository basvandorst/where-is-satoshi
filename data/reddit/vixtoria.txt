No, not make, just transact in or out of 20k
@_date: 2019-07-31 19:34:17
No, not really, it is total in transactions. Example: If you moved $4,000 into or out of Coinbase 5 times, exchanged it to other coins on Coinbase, etc it will count as $20k in transactions. Lets say you sold &amp; then bough back in, repeat, it'll add up total transaction wise.

 It isn't like they will send you a bill with what you owed &amp; that's that. What will happen is they will audit you and/or at the very least hit you with penalties &amp; interest (which are very high) along with what you owe.

Good luck with that lol

Maybe we are talking about different things. I thought you were saying you didn’t report any of your gains, and were just going to wait until the IRS came  after you and then pay.

Just don’t burn your cookies.

You do understand when you purchase goods and/or services with bitcoin that counts as a reportable taxable event in the US right?

I was taking the upvote %

Well a lot of places instantly convert the price to fiat. I am talking about using bitcoin with no fiat involved. Still results in having to file that transaction with the IRS.
@_date: 2018-03-29 20:29:51
It is a property of USING bitcoin though.

This literally is not what I am saying at all. You obviously didn't read anything I wrote. That's ok, most don't read articles or posts anymore, just the title, its the new norm. :/

Of course. I bought 90% of my holdings in 2013. I said price has nothing to do with it. See, this is the problem with this community. Any negative talk about bitcoin (I am not talking negative about bitcoin, by the way) = assuming “aww cry cuz you bought high”.
@_date: 2018-03-29 21:02:13
So back to my original question, why then would anyone in the US want to use bitcoin as a currency? That is all I was saying. Now you see my point! ... Yes, fuck the USA and all its taxes... it is ridiculous
@_date: 2018-03-29 20:31:59
Right. It is an investment vehicle almost 100% now. That’s all it is now and what the community has voted for with their “hodl” mentality, not “spedn”.
@_date: 2018-03-29 21:08:47
I guess this conversation is for the 300,000,000 or so people that live in the US, not you.
@_date: 2018-03-29 21:10:20
Well right now about 70% of the people reading this disagree with you.
@_date: 2018-03-29 23:56:28
Of course, but in this instance I’m only talking about the US. Sigh.
@_date: 2018-03-29 23:11:43
My question was specific for just USA. I was not referring to Bitcoin as a whole... I really need to make better titles to posts, as that is pretty much the only thing people will read.

So you are promoting illegal activity.... I see. I hope you get audited as the IRS would love for you to tell them you didn't pay your capital gains tax because you were 'smart enough' to not link your real ID. =)
