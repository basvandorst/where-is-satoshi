See, my background is in finance, specifically investments, and in your position it's usually viewed best to cut your losses, take the tax break and move on.
@_date: 2014-11-26 01:24:18
Well, this is nice. I'll be sure to use your site in the future, if I ever move that is haha!

I love that analogy, saving that for future usage!
@_date: 2014-12-18 13:25:17
I understand long term investing, I've studied finance and have my BA in the field. My issue with it is that using it to pay for goods and services can add risk because if I agree to pay $100 for an item and transfer the funds via Bitcoin, since Bitcoin is so volatile I may end up paying $110 or maybe $90.
@_date: 2014-12-18 19:53:12
Or just buy index funds and own all of this with more convenience. I own index funds in US stocks, US bonds, non-US stocks, commodities, REITs, and now BTC. I usually stay away from non-US bonds because I feel they involve more research than I am willing to put in for a return that I can get elsewhere. But you're point is 100% valid!
@_date: 2014-12-03 02:00:52
I know coinbase has all the features I want, it's what I currently use. But it keeps logging me out and not letting me back in about once every 2-3 days. It's pissing me off. I'm going to give Circle a try.
@_date: 2014-11-23 03:29:41
Ok, will report back later when I am home. I did create an account though.

If you're only investing what you can afford to lose you're not investing. True investing involves picking what will provide you the maximum return for the least amount of risk available to you. You're thinking of speculating.
@_date: 2014-12-30 02:32:49
Not a "Treky" sorry.

I found an app "Circle for Bitcoin" I assume that is correct. Does it work with Mint?
@_date: 2014-12-18 13:22:51
But Bitcoin isn't an investment, it's purpose it countered by its volatility in price. 
@_date: 2014-11-26 01:34:56
I'll definitely be telling my friends about your site. Where I live most landlords are decent people, but it never hurts to check.
@_date: 2014-12-18 13:29:14
I'm losing interest because of the volatility negating the instant payment fundamentals. 
@_date: 2014-12-28 22:48:49
Thanks, was on my phone and the FAQs are weird to read. I'll look at it tonight!
@_date: 2014-12-18 19:40:36
If enthusiasts are so hard set on Bitcoin though, why not leverage their position?
@_date: 2014-12-18 19:56:58
If you owe me $1000 and you're going to send it to me via Bitcoin, fine. But by the time you send me the Bitcoin and I cash out to actually receive me money, that $1000 could be worth only $950. Yes, it could be worth $1050 instead, but the point is that there is added risk involved simply with sending the payment via Bitcoin rather than waiting a bitc and sending it via Paypal or Bank2Bank of some kind.
@_date: 2014-12-30 19:28:15
This guys gets it... 200 bits

I'm only a week late :D
@_date: 2014-11-24 01:04:24
I agree, I don't understand why people feel that tipping of any size is dumb. It spreads the word. If you tipped 100 people 1 bit that now shows 100 people that it is that east to transfer money and it only cost you, what, $0.04? If you can afford to tip more, then by all means do so, but for those who are just getting started and learning as well, tipping 1/5/10/25 bits maybe all a person can do and it still spreads the word. Especially when you start tipping on Twitter to new people - which is my personal favorite thing. Most people on Reddit are already aware of Bitcoin, but on other websites where you can tip - that is where the news needs to be spread.
Tip on.

Does this only work from a computer? It's not working on my phone.
@_date: 2014-12-18 19:46:12
Yeah, and I can look at *the right time frame* for oil and show you when it was nothing but up. I understand that investments have their ups and their downs. Bitcoin (since it grew in popularity) looks like an IPO of Twitter or something. I huge BOOM and then it fizzled down to something more realistic. Just because something is growing doesn't mean that people should be losing a lot of money in it (read 1000+/BTC investments now worth about 300/BTC). I understand where Bitcoin fits in society, I agree it is incredibly useful, hell I even agree it is a currency and not just a commodity or service. My point is that the usage I see available with Bitcoin (instant payment from P2P) is not as useful if the value of the underlying coin is constantly moving in such a volatile way.
If you owe me $1000 and you're going to send it to me via Bitcoin, fine. But by the time you send me the Bitcoin and I cash out to actually receive me money, that $1000 could be worth only $950. Yes, it could be worth $1050 instead, but the point is that there is added risk involved simply with sending the payment via Bitcoin rather than waiting a bitc and sending it via Paypal or Bank2Bank of some kind.

If it on falls to $1, I will have $0.16381 worth of Bitcoin.

I don't view Bitcoin as an investment, but it's people like you that will get it noticed as a currency. Good luck.

But I have a wallet address? I thought at least... Is the wallet address I got when I joined not a *real* wallet? I've heard of people storing the BTC on their computer. I have a Mac, what is the most user friendly way for me to do this? Also is this the safest?

Why not Bitcoin within an IRA?

@_date: 2015-01-26 06:52:03
No, you're speculating that the price will rise. Bitcoin isn't an investment. S/He is right. 
@_date: 2015-01-04 02:29:37
You can if you roll over the 401K into an IRA that can be self-directed. Use the funds to invest in an LLC that you create within the IRA. The LLC is setup to make money by purchasing Bitcoin, then purchases the Bitcoins as the business plan.
@_date: 2015-01-14 09:11:45

Xapo is requiring ID to move them.

@_date: 2015-07-19 15:36:18
As the supply shrinks even if the demand stays equal the price will rise. Coins are being pumped out, but there is a cap of how many will exist. 
@_date: 2015-07-27 02:37:15
I like Coinbase. Xapo is requiring ID to move them. 
@_date: 2015-07-19 15:48:36
It can, but overtime it should grow due to demand. Look at Greece for instance. I'm not saying put 100% of your income into it. I'm saying try to hold to what you can.

I've owned Bitcoin for as long as changetip has been around (that's how I was introduced) but started buying in small amounts here and there for about 6 months. I work a job that's commission based and it's been slow. I had to cash out.

Brokerage companies issue a 1099 for your taxable accounts to show your profits and losses as well as dividends. If coinbase doesn't, oh well.

Thats a great return in all honesty.

I would suggest discounts when customers pay via Bitcoin. You definitely need to brand yourself along with Bitcoin as well. Put signs up on your store that say "Bitcoin accepted here" possibly add a "ask me how" as well and be prepared to explain it to an 80 year old. 
I know someone else suggested rebates, but that could lead to wasted coin. Maybe do rebates via changetip through Twitter? Uncollected bits would be returned to you if they truly do not have an interest.
