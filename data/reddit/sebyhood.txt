You were wrong. Up 15%
@_date: 2018-01-02 16:19:59
I was gonna suggest that. Nice hash is noob friendly but for sure mine in a pool if you are serious about it
@_date: 2018-01-06 18:05:49
Hoping I'm a genuis. Im not investing with sub hundred million dollar market caps. That's what idiots do
@_date: 2018-01-06 18:17:24
There is little money to be made in Bitcoin. I see it more as a safe bet and that's fine for people who have millions or hundreds of thousands of dollars in Bitcoin but for normal people with as little as a grand to invest we should be looking at the coins that are bull flagging and set to grow 25% a day. 
@_date: 2018-01-06 16:05:35
Interesting.  I don't want to get emotionally invested in something that isn't real so I'm not gonna bother checking the prices. 
@_date: 2018-01-02 16:20:23
Remind me in one day
@_date: 2018-01-06 18:23:10
My top pick is colossus coin xt. 
@_date: 2018-01-02 08:24:23
Mining Bitcoin it's self is not worth it unless you have the newest Asics model and even then it's a gamble. If you are interested in mining id suggest buying some gpus and installing nice hash
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:52:41
Time to sell
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:26:56
It's going up or down or staying flat
@_date: 2017-12-29 17:22:40
I suppose but wouldn't a temp knock out all electrical devices on the planet
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:05:48
Yeah for sure is fun to watch. I watched Bitcoin double before I got a chance to buy at $1600   planning on buying today though
@_date: 2017-12-29 17:20:31
Rn I'm nervous about the price just bombing cause of the way the curve looks but really we are just in a bear market rn and I anticipate a rally in the new year. I wouldn't short Bitcoin tho I'm only gonna hold for a few more months tho
@_date: 2017-12-30 03:05:00
Its dropping pretty steep rn and I'm all freaking out n shit
@_date: 2017-12-31 01:13:16
You're just upset because the market is down right now. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 17:46:22
Depends. That thing probably only goes up 200feet tops. If we want to get to the moon we must work together with Elon musk to shoot Bitcoin to the moon. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:57:14
You enjoy life
@_date: 2017-12-31 14:20:52
Anything is possible. Not looking great rn
@_date: 2017-12-29 12:19:10
Id personality use an ATM. The fees are a wanker but everyone deals with that. You could use gdax tho I hear that has way less fees
@_date: 2017-12-15 01:33:00
Apple was a bubble on the moon
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:04:43
I have my btc in a wallet so I can't do stop loss. I'm planning on buying at the bottom not sure yet
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:21:58
Yeah gonna be hodling. I already held through this deep we just had 
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:39:21
I have my Bitcoin on my phone rn also interested in moving it into wallet. I'm guessing you mean a paper one
@_date: 2017-12-28 17:23:41
No idea bro
@_date: 2017-12-29 12:12:41
Go to the pub and get liquored
@_date: 2017-12-31 22:39:24
Thank u
@_date: 2017-12-31 01:19:59
As a Weezer fan I approve
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:30:57
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:26:38
This is a big blip
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:28:21
I just hope it stays at $1400 so I can get my paycheck tomorrow and buy:/
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:20:45
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:14:54
What's phase 2? Lambos on the moon?
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:45:49
Fuck you she's gonna scan my QR code
@_date: 2017-12-31 22:39:08
He did. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:01:03
That's a lot. I only got .03  lol
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:23:58
It's ok man
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:06:35
I hope I'll get a decent deal
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:02:29
I mean it could go up down or sideways for hours or years. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 17:17:03
Any ATM should be fine. Idk what you are looking for. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 09:52:58
Sounds like wishful thinking or gambling. Personality I see bitcoins ability to double and I'm just trying to double my money
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:15:55
Really? So who told you this
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:13:23
Needed this
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:02:40
Get a fucking job buy some fucking bitcoins. (exactly what I'm doing) I'm 17 
@_date: 2017-12-31 22:40:30
Fuck it
@_date: 2017-12-31 17:47:43
I'm gonna sell my Bitcoins before I turn 18 so no taxes
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:49:27
You can give a man a fish feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish feed him for life. Buy low sell high hodl
@_date: 2017-12-29 13:54:30
But there is the minimum Bitcoin network fee tho. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:03:09
Lol ik
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:46:19
At this point I'm getting worried. Holding
@_date: 2017-12-28 20:01:49
My fee way $50 I put $400 into the machine. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:09:30
Bought Bitcoin cause I believed. This is my first scary ride
@_date: 2017-12-29 17:16:10
Interesting let me know. That's really cool if it ears the fees. You gotta jump through a lot of hoops to use gdax tho like sending pictures of your face and Id and proof of electrical bills and shit
@_date: 2017-12-14 11:33:52
Literally me. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 01:23:06
I bought at 14500 I feel stupid
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:20:25
I have a clue? What big correction are you talking about. So I'm a rookie cause I bought in the dip. Idk I now think I paid 3% ATM fee plus Bitcoin transaction fee. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:43:53
I bought from an ATM for the first time today was really easy. You just put in your bills scan your code. There's the stupid fees but it works
@_date: 2017-12-31 22:38:50
Idk about you but here in Canada minors don't pay taxes. That's like shooting somebody when they are down
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:46:55
My plan exactly
@_date: 2017-12-31 14:21:35
My dad has 12 Asus 1080 TI's he says that they are the best
@_date: 2017-12-30 23:59:55
Stressing out mate
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:11:33
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:55:34
35% sale
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:17:52
Nah I'm getting my profits back at %100 profit and letting it sit so no lambos for me. Gonna mine vert coin tho
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:01:46
Yep. It's aight
@_date: 2017-12-30 04:48:27
Yeah I have no doubt the market is healthy and it's not crashing. Past few days have been boring tho and I've been watching like a hawk. I should stop. I hope for the run up with you man. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:30:41
Good point. I'm buying more today. I really don't think Bitcoin can double that many more times tho
@_date: 2017-12-31 06:06:35
Dude you chill. Hindsight is 20/20 I definitely understand it takes time
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:53:32
What aboot the beaver eh
@_date: 2017-12-29 18:42:57
@_date: 2017-12-31 00:26:59
Maybe. Just trying to double my money one time.  
@_date: 2017-12-31 14:44:50
Thx man. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:41:15
Yeah this guy seems weird. What does the karma mean?
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:15:43
Maybe but us canoe is still afloat. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:57:29
Quality market analysis. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 17:24:09
You mumble alot. I can't understand you. I know this is 2017 and everyone wants to be a mumble rapper but don't when talking about Bitcoin. And I don't know what udders are. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:37:27
Fugazy fugazie it's a wazzy it's woozy it's *chirp chirp chirp* fairy dust it's nothing it's not landed it's not on the elemental table. 
@_date: 2018-10-13 04:30:57
How do you do that with transaction feed
@_date: 2017-12-31 14:25:41
Why is there squiggly lines all over the thumb nail?
@_date: 2018-06-05 22:04:52
This is what simple minded people can't understand. When I say I bought a house for 450 I don't mean $450 huer dur
@_date: 2018-06-30 06:05:34
So when do I buy wtf
@_date: 2017-11-26 10:11:25

@_date: 2017-11-26 09:46:46
good point. i want to buy stocks too. what would you recommend to diversify into? 
@_date: 2017-11-26 10:48:40
is it really that early in the game? how much higher could the price of one coin go? 
@_date: 2017-11-26 10:56:02
ALL IN. this shit is crayz
@_date: 2017-11-26 09:45:33

@_date: 2017-11-26 09:56:40
im hyped asf
@_date: 2017-11-26 10:36:36
my mind has been blown tonight. 20mins ago i was dancing with my cat and telling him to buy bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 09:55:57
my dad has like $6000 worth of light coins
@_date: 2017-11-26 09:54:51
yes i am aware that the value does dips. im in it for the long haul tho! it would be so awesome if i made my first million before im 20
@_date: 2017-11-26 09:48:35
yes man. im gunna sell some things too so i can invest the money. not sure what hodl is
@_date: 2017-11-26 09:52:25
ahh yes this is what i was thinking about. if i invest all year and lets say the value of my bitcoin wallet reaches $10,000 by this time next year and i cash it in and next month it reaches $20,000 ill be really sad. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 11:59:37
i hope you are right. id like to be rich in a few years
@_date: 2018-03-19 15:50:56
What about the transaction fee? Haven't moved btc in a few months but it was $40 last time. 
@_date: 2018-07-30 14:58:58
Money is baked by oil &amp; gas industry. Good luck running your miner without gasoline or your lambo or mansion. Bitcoin popped anyway. Watch this get down voted and denied
