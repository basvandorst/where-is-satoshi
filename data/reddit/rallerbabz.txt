I'm sorry for being negative, but I find this very misleading. Hopefully the guy won't get the expression that people are actually willing to use the service, because I'm very surprised if anyone else than OP (maybe 1 at most) will go purchase.

Exactly my thought. Kinda cheat that he didnt put a zero in front - 0.1
@_date: 2013-11-18 17:00:38
It's just the total amount he has mined from Deepbit.net. As you can see above the total, he has cashed out several times to the wallet address stated there.

I like this idea, but I think the better solution is to moderate this subreddit heavily instead. The is really a lot of bullshit threads

3.30 what? PM/AM or/and what timezone?
@_date: 2013-11-19 22:12:22
Stop beggin..
@_date: 2013-11-17 13:20:49
I've formatted my computer plenty of time since then. I'm not entirely sure that I've downloaded some kind of wallet software tho
@_date: 2013-11-17 13:26:19
I have nothing on my MtGox account so I dont believe so. I'm afraid I can't quite remember what I did with my wallet. What was popular back then? :P
@_date: 2013-11-18 11:53:48
Should I buy bitcoins right now or wait??
@_date: 2013-11-22 22:10:43
It's much more secure. They need your phone with the app before they can get in. The only danger when 2FA is activated is if Blockchain gets hacked. 
@_date: 2013-11-29 23:50:40
Really? Lol
@_date: 2013-11-20 21:10:07
I guess. I just wish the bitcoin would stabilize, I mean totally as we've seen in the past where it went steadily but surely up. At that point I might want to buy some more, but I feel like it's such a risk to do since there's a huge possibility of bitcoin dropping down to 2-300 dollars atm with the bubble taking off.. The good news might be covering up for it, but I still believe we're going down.
@_date: 2013-11-18 17:51:59
After signing up and downloading it there is no offer about bitcoins? It didnt even ask for my bitcoin address, so I'm wondering how it can give any BTCs :p
@_date: 2013-11-17 23:36:50
Yeah, on the backside I can see that 4d is my CPR number as I suggested and 5 is my "Driver License number". Pretty sure it's that ;) Thanks!
@_date: 2013-11-17 19:01:17
Tak! Tjekker det ud med det samme ;) Hvordan er det at komme af med dem igen, når man nu engang synes man vil have fortjenesten udbetalt?
@_date: 2013-11-17 23:28:08
Yeah it looks exactly like that. But the number outside 4d is my CPR number. Is that what they are looking for? I also have a 5, which is just 8 random numbers
@_date: 2013-11-20 01:25:36
I'd be willing to help with anything if you go for this. But my bet is it would be hard. I might also know a good developer who can help.
@_date: 2013-11-20 19:38:09
Got in 2 days ago, bought at 600. Disappointed :P I wont ever buy more before it becomes stable. I can't take this no more - gives me heartattacks.
@_date: 2013-11-17 12:35:51
I wish I knew how to purchase :-\ 
@_date: 2013-11-17 13:30:32
Haha, no worries, glad you want to help me at least..
The address is 
@_date: 2013-11-17 13:18:05
Okay, it seems like there is 533 dollars on the account. Is it possible to get back?
EDIT: It seems like the total 533 has been then withdrawed to another wallet I have no clue who is...When I click this wallet, all its money has then been transferred to yet another wallet with even more money...Does this mean someone has stolen the money? :-(
@_date: 2013-11-17 15:14:35
I'm in Europe(Denmark) :-/
@_date: 2013-04-12 21:20:20
Wouldnt Paypal be a good choice? It's pretty simple compared to the current methods.
@_date: 2013-11-19 00:54:07
Yeah, indeed. And they eat 4,9% in fees. But they're fast at least :)
But is 777 dollars that bad? It's at 792 dollars as I write this on 
@_date: 2013-11-17 14:18:17
I followed the address as well and got the same outcome. ~~Is it because someone took the bitcoins from me or what happened exactly?~~
I remember I installed some stuff, but I'm not sure if it was just the mining client or a wallet as well. I dont remember any wallet tho, but it's a long time ago, I could easily be wrong. 
I've checked my email account and I can't find any mention of wallet or bitcoin. The only email regarding that is from Mtgox and Deepbit.
EDIT: Currently I'm running a deep scan with Recuva in hope to find the wallet.dat, but I dont think it'll be possible, especially because I've formatted several times and not just once. None of the Ewallets seems familiar, it might have been some kind of client that I've installed back then..
@_date: 2013-11-17 13:25:18
Unfortunately I've formatted my computers several time since 4 years ago :-( But yeah, I was using Win7 back then
@_date: 2013-11-17 13:49:45
I kind of fear, that someone stole my bitcoins since most of it has been withdrawed to another wallet I have no clue of...Is it correct? :-(
@_date: 2013-11-22 13:49:17
Activate 2FA, 
so much more secure 
@_date: 2013-11-18 18:02:22
Haha, no worries - I was just wondering :)
And thanks, always nice with some free BTCs after I lost my wallet with my single BTC :D
@_date: 2013-11-17 22:41:11
Hej igen! :)
Jeg har lige et spørgsmål ang de bitcoins fra bitcoinnordic - der står de tager 4,9% af prisen, det var da  helt absurd meget!? O.o Kan det passe og er det sådan alle steder?
@_date: 2013-11-19 00:32:39
 is the fastest I know in europe. 
@_date: 2013-11-18 16:28:51
I know your loss is way more, but I also recentl lost 1,17 bitcoins :-(
@_date: 2013-11-17 13:24:06
Sorry, I was sure I read all you wrote, somehow missed the last sentence..
Anyway, I'm afraid I dont know. I've formatted my computer plenty of times since then, so any wallet.dat would probably be gone :-(
@_date: 2013-11-19 23:46:20
I'm no expert on Bitcoins, just recently bought my first 0,5 bitcoin, but I'd consider to speak with a lawyer or something. Cashing out 3 million dollars suddenly out of no where might get you in trouble. Therefore I'd also suggest you to sell over time. Use localbitcoins to set up deals with private persons, cash a little out at different exchanges like Mtgox, Bitstamp, coinbase etc. Cashing out over time might cause some losses if Bitcoin drop in price but at this point you shouldnt let greed control you. The losses will be minimal compared to the amount of money you've made :)
@_date: 2013-11-18 10:37:06
Well it takes at least a few days before I can buy :-\ i don't know any place to buy instant 
@_date: 2013-11-19 00:13:31
I've just downloaded the wallet and then installed truecrypt. Crypted the file and uploaded it to Dropbox.
@_date: 2013-11-17 15:01:25
I'm not sure if this is what you want 
I can't see any transaction on my account and even tho I have an Mtgox account, I never really used it to buy/sell.
And thanks..The HDD is 1 TB so the scan takes a while..It says 2 hours left, and started it after I made the thread. I will cross my fingers, heh.
@_date: 2013-11-17 23:17:49
The thing is you need to verify your Mtgox account and in order to do that, you need some kind of american license it seems like..For example it requires an ID number when you select Driver's License, but I can't find anything on my Driver License..:/
