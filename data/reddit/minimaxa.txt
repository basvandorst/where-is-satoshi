Thought I would join you! 
A big thank you to the Stellar org and hodlers over this year. 
Decided to give some of my profits to a worth while organisation and provide 10 bicycles to the third world - 
They are  on Barrons’ Top 25 Most Effective Philanthropies and 77% of funds go towards providing bikes. 
All the best for another awesome 2018!

Stay away from coinbase, keep your transactions spread out on many exchanges and transfers out into different sources under $10K.
@_date: 2017-12-24 10:06:18
Profits well spent
@_date: 2017-12-24 02:41:38
Keep your finger on the sell button could go either way at the moment
@_date: 2017-12-24 02:48:33
Because we are in a correction and it might go lower? 
Unless you are into roller coaster dips of pain. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:29:14
Looks like we are going back up to test the resistance points. 
Hold tight��

Fomo is one hella of drug, it got us from $8k to $20k in one month and $20k to $12k in 1 week. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 01:10:01
Did Ok yesterday �� 
Missed the third wave down to the bottom as I bought at 13k and fell asleep and sold out a bit too early but still made some minor profits 
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:58:16
Looks like we got ourselves a pre Xmas fire sale boys!
How low will it go $14K or $12K?
@_date: 2017-12-24 12:48:46
You have to admit though balls of steel if you are buying right now. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 06:11:51
Nice pump without much pull back, someone just doubled down hard. 
Thought it was a typical fake out to lure some chumps out and then dump.
@_date: 2017-12-19 04:41:31
So are they happy to provide a tax credit for all of the fees and losses for my past currency transactions over the last 40 + years? 
You never see them offering to do that in public forums. 
I think we are Even Stevens. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 00:11:03
Well if 12k does not hold we will test 8k which means 1 month of gains wiped out. 
The volume is so low I doubt we will do this and there are so many sharks sitting on the sidelines waiting to buy back in it is all smoke and mirrors shaking out weak hands.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:46:31
Once we double bottom out I’m going to load up the truck btc and Stellar Lumens baby! 
This ain’t over yet.
@_date: 2017-12-24 14:10:31
Forget this I’m going to get some sleep, Big day of food and fun tomorrow, the kids love it. 
Try not to stress too much holders, have a great day with your family, they are far more important then any silly volatile currency. 
Have a great Christmas everyone, it has been another very exciting year in crypto.
@_date: 2017-12-23 02:56:24
Unfortunately the old world ways are all we have until the crypto community is mature enough to create new terminology relating specifically to trading for what we do.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:00:08
At least wait for the double bottom support confirmation before diving in...
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:16:39
Back down they go to test support
@_date: 2017-12-24 13:05:59
The spirits are talking through me now and they say bitcoin will go down but then it will go up again then maybe down then maybe back up. That is all
@_date: 2017-12-30 03:07:44
Just get your fake controlled dump over with so everyone sitting on the sidelines can buy some bargains and start going back up again.
@_date: 2017-12-24 12:40:15
Oh dear this is where it might get a little ugly

Use the force Luke, just like bulls eying womp rats in the T-16 back home.
Their are allot of us on the sidelines waiting for a cheaper point to buy back in. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 10:09:42
Wow that was like a massive back hand bitch slap from out of nowhere.
@_date: 2017-12-30 09:17:01
Just get the suspense over with already drop to $10K then start the pump back up.
@_date: 2017-12-23 23:49:54
The question is how low will it go? 
Looks like the last chance to load up.
@_date: 2017-12-21 09:37:59
Tricky market short term, can’t decide if it’s going up or down this week.

Yeah it is just like Amway, would he like to have a dinner party at my place to explain? 
@_date: 2017-12-29 14:19:30
It could go either way, lost all my nerve to dive tonight if it corrects again will wait till tomorrow. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 03:29:48
They are heavily entrenched in mining ASICS so they will keep them running to maximise roi as a long as they can, plus electricity prices are cheap because of hydro power investment which is why China is number 1 in mining,

One thing most people are failing to recognise is the majority of us have already paid taxes on the money earned some pay 40% or more via direct payroll and indirect taxes - stamp duty, Sales tax, gst tax, petrol tax, car registration and road improvement taxes. 
Currency conversions happen all across the world everyday and most of us loose millions via spreads and greedy currency conversion fees. I don’t ever see the govts of the world stepping up and advising all of these fees are a tax deductible credit even though they are? 
Also this is not a business for most of us it is a hobby so we are not registered the same and not claiming the same costs and expenses as corporations who have plant and employee expenses. 
Also majority of the exchanges can’t even answer emails currently from users so I seriously doubt they will keep records of all transactions for every trader, plus many are located overseas, if your transactions are on an overseas exchange I seriously doubt they are going to hand over records of trades to another country. Some say this is your responsibility to keep records, good luck calculating these profits and losses accurately. 
Look at Mt Gox and Crypsty exchanges which went under and stole
Millions, none of those funds were ever returned or claimable for a tax deduction as no records were kept. 
I am not against paying my fair share of tax but a double dip seems excessive, And because the fiat currencies values are eroding for the last 100 years does not mean the govts are welcome to recoup their losses. 
Most larger corporations pay minimal to no tax due to “smart” avoidance of the system via offshore countries.
The government gets more than their fair share from the middle class tax revenue and they are not that great at managing our money.
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:44:48
That is exactly what Big money groups do! 
Look at the threads palm beach confidential they send out alerts to buy/sell. 
The problem with the 28k of followers on this reddit channel is half of them already bought and are holding and the other 30-40% are 15 year olds all with $100 of their pocket money.��
Which leaves us 10% to swing trade in different time zones and there is no hive mind any negative trade analysis is seen as fud here. 
Plus we are Competing against financial institutions whales. You look at the buy and sell walls they are very thin as they are waiting on the sidelines to buy and or dump. 
I think the futures trading has added an extra element of manipulation as they want to see there shorts get filled so if the have to loose a few $100K dumping on the exchanges it is not much compared to the futures contract gains. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 00:38:11
So is this a baby dump or one of those long 3 wave eye watering flush another $100 billion down the toilet dumps?

It is going to retrace and test support after that should be another good buying opp.

If $12K does not hold we test $8K and that pretty much wipes out a months worth of bull run gains. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 07:51:34
Yes we should help them and our govts should stop funding rogue factions with weapons and money to prop up the petro dollar.
They have been fighting for multiple generations and it is about time they read the Koran and learn to get along and share their land and tolerate everyone just like we have to. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:24:10
Wow what a buying opp, just waiting for the double bottom confirmation before diving in.

I miss the good old days when bitcoin just went up everyday..,,,.,,
@_date: 2017-12-24 04:42:41
Same strategy as when I went on holidays and had to exchange money all around the world and none of the governments gave a tax credit for all of the fees I lost exchanging currencies at different rates. 
The govt can call crypto what they like an asset, commodity or digital currency it does not entitle them to rape us any longer they get enough of our money through direct payroll taxes and indirect taxes currently.
