We ship anywhere!

We can't use PayPal anymore even if we wanted to. They dropped us. We also accept credit cards, so we aren't exclusively Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-11-28 20:07:22
Aww, you're making me blush. :P
@_date: 2013-11-29 09:52:30
Our ratio varies based on the flavor and strength, but they stay around 60/40. 
@_date: 2013-11-28 14:18:22
I'm extremely biased because I think they're all awesome, but lately, I can't put the Butterscotch down!
@_date: 2013-11-28 15:17:57
Our BitPay account is restricted to $100/day until it's verified (see pic below,) which we are $3 shy of, so your order may not go through. If not, you can try again tomorrow. Hopefully they're quick with the verification. If for some reason they can't get it taken care of before our sale ends on Monday, shoot us a message, and we'll get you (and anyone else encountering the same issue) a coupon code so you can still get the Thanksgiving sale price. 
I requested the "Basic" option and will work on Verified or Trusted when I'm back in the office.

You have a valid point. However, unfortunately when it comes to PayPal and credit card processing, they do lump ecigs in with tobacco. It's silly that they do this as there's NO tobacco. We encountered the same issues with credit card processors before that FAQ page was even written. :/ If there's a demand for PayPal from our customers, I may appeal. At this point though, good riddance. 
@_date: 2013-11-28 07:28:06
We just got our first Bitcoin order!! 
@_date: 2013-11-28 17:08:00
I hope you enjoy it! We put a lot of thought into what our kit would consist of. We're really happy with the performance, and I actually prefer the tank over the Protank 2 I had been using! Plus, we were able to offer the glass with a replaceable coil for about the same price as other sites sell CE4 kits for, even though it meant making very little profit. Despite being a business and the goal being making money, we want to make quality products available to people with lower budgets. Happy, smoke-free customers are our goal
@_date: 2013-11-28 16:50:02
Thanks! Any way you can expedite upping the $100 limit? 
@_date: 2013-11-28 14:23:07
Apparently "tobacco products" are against PayPal's terms, and unfortunately eLiquid has been lumped into that category. We also had a very hard time finding a credit card processor for this reason. 
No more 404, and you're right, the image is a tad big. We'll get that taken care of. Thanks!
@_date: 2013-11-29 09:52:48
And thanks! :)
@_date: 2013-11-28 14:55:04
Fifth, actually. :)
@_date: 2013-11-28 20:14:26
The notice consisted of "your account is frozen until you fix it"
@_date: 2013-11-28 14:45:39
Oh yes, we are working on new flavors constantly. We only make for sale the flavors that we think are perfect. Quality over quantity! Our site has been up and running for about a month now. All of our eLiquids are 50% off for our Thanksgiving sale, so our prices aren't always this good. We do always have a coupon code for at least 10% off at any time though. 
@_date: 2013-11-28 17:14:00
We'll consider appealing to PayPal if there's a demand as a significant portion of sales were via PayPal. We still accept credit cards though, so hopefully our PayPal customers have a PayPal debit card if they don't use Bitcoin! I'll post a follow-up in a few weeks for all of you curious cats. :)
@_date: 2013-11-28 14:58:17
I added our Thanksgiving sale that's going on to the Bitcoin Black Friday site. We are already doing 50% off all eLiquids and have a coupon code (THANKS) for an extra 10% off of orders over $20, so we can't do anything more. :/
@_date: 2013-11-28 07:26:25
Haha, well, they gave us the boot before we could quit them. However, we had been using PayPal to pay for all of our shipping, but now, I think I'll just use a credit card on the USPS site. (Until USPS starts accepting Bitcoin anyway!) 
@_date: 2013-11-28 14:51:08
Some people get caught faster than others, I guess. 
@_date: 2013-11-28 17:10:22
$25 outside of the US. 
@_date: 2013-11-28 15:36:09
@_date: 2013-11-28 14:53:47
We already accept credit cards. Thanks for the suggestion of stripe.com though. We'll look into them because we are considered a "high-risk merchant" (because of the whole "tobacco product" thing) and pay somewhat high rates and fees because of it. 
@_date: 2013-11-28 14:18:40
Definitely! 
@_date: 2013-11-28 17:24:04
Ah, well, there's always 0mg. ;)
@_date: 2013-11-28 14:37:16
We don't currently offer any PG-free liquids, but all of our flavors are available without nicotine. Black River Blend is a sweeter tobacco blend that's very smooth if you like tobacco flavors. I'm currently obsessed with Butterscotch. It's flavorful, but not overpowering, and very smooth!
Edit: Feel free to visit our site (shopmastervape.com) to check out the whole lineup. We're working on new flavors constantly, so check back periodically for new things. 
@_date: 2013-11-28 17:42:30
Money. 
@_date: 2013-11-28 14:42:06
Well, Bitcoin integration with Shopify was just introduced yesterday, and yesterday morning is when we got the nice little email from PayPal. As a Bitcoin proponent, I am very excited about accepting Bitcoin. As a business person, I understand that we may be hurt by it. PayPal dropping us is something we can't change. We still accept credit cards, and now we are still able to offer an alternative method with Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-11-28 07:24:37
We sure do! :)
@_date: 2013-12-02 08:11:55
Exactly what strength are you wanting? Check your email-I'll send you an invoice through BitPay. 
@_date: 2013-11-28 17:09:09
Thanks! We think you'll like them!

PayPal's decision to restrict our account was made before we set up Bitcoin on the site, so (at least in our case) there doesn't seem to be any correlation. 
Here's the email that we received:

Buy her a starter kit and tell her you got the eLiquid for you two to share! :P 
@_date: 2013-11-28 20:16:28
All of our eLiquids are 50% off right now for our Thanksgiving sale, but out regular prices are generally comparable to or less than other places. We pretty much always have at least 10% off coupons floating around too! 
@_date: 2013-11-28 16:48:56
7, actually. ;) 
Really though, our website is purposely minimal. Our focus is on our products, and we felt that a bunch of clutter can make things confusing and/or distracting. I admit that some of our graphics could use improvement, and we're in the process of getting better descriptions written. We are a new company with a limited budget, so we do what we can. Thanks for your input though! 
@_date: 2013-11-28 14:28:46
We accept credit cards, so we still have a payment option that most people can use. About 30% of our orders were PayPal though, so it's possible that we see a decline. 
@_date: 2013-11-28 07:24:26
The only hardware that we currently have is our Starter Kit, but we are hoping to be able to expand our selection in the future. We definitely won't be carrying any and everything though. We will only carry what we have tested and personally enjoy. Both of my parents actually have an eroll, and we all think they're pretty awesome, so that's definitely something we are planning on offering! 
And yes, we do ship internationally!
