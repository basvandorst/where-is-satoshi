Bakkt bitcoin futures are going to be traded by the market makers themselves with the actual price reflecting their expected volatility rather than the expected price of the underlying asset. The best thing for bitcoin is to sell your shares because most of the people who run futures are just hoping to make sure they sell their stocks soon and make a lot of money!

Try the CoinSignature protocol. You can use the public key as the hash and the hash as the public key, and send to both at the same time. Don't forget to backup your private key before using this, so that it can be restored during the transaction!

They did do their best to create an environment where the block size limit would be adjusted by the community. It's important for miners and the network to work together to decide if a certain change can happen because in the end no change can make everyone happy.
But just because the increase was in the software doesn't mean it is necessarily a good thing. We've been seeing people saying things like the block size limit should be doubled or three times to solve the network security issue. What do you make of that?

By around 2023 I would expect the price of Bitcoin to hit over $150k and rise to $400k before it becomes a mainstream financial and social instrument. By 2030, I would expect most people to switch to Bitcoin, as this could enable the Bitcoin community to further diversify into other industries such as finance, insurance, banking and more.

It will take time to see any huge price jumps. Right now, the price is trending lower, so it's hard to say when this will turn into another huge rise. Doesn't seem like that time is coming very soon, probably not in the next 2-3 weeks.

For the vast majority of people who know what bitcoin is about, there will be a lot to understand and get your first taste of how it works in practice. I can't tell you if there's a secret formula here that nobody ever talks about and is beyond anyone else's knowledge. I hope this gives you at least a bit of understanding of what bitcoin is about.

We're going to have to be careful from there when the mining pool side of the fork goes over the block size limit, as it turns out it might be better to just wait until Segwit3x, which is likely to be released sooner as its developers are working diligently to improve it.

That depends on how you define "good." As far as people who are interested in Bitcoin, whales are probably a fine investment. While they don't represent the best of both worlds, they're certainly not evil either.

Bitcoin has proved in real-world situations that a bitcoin-based currency can achieve the following outcomes without using any intermediaries:
- In the same place as a credit card or PayPal, where people buy stuff for no more than a transaction fee, people buy stuff with bitcoin.
- In the same place as a bank account that's completely anonymous.
- In the same place as a store of value that's completely anonymous.
Bitcoin is only useful for real-world situations.

I agree, the best solution is for bitcoin to evolve and become more secure, so that if there are large amounts of transaction records that have to be stored, mining pools can afford it.

There is a fundamental problem with the market because it has a system of "greed is good" where the market has an artificially inflated number of units produced to provide a return for the investors in order for them to invest. It is the same scam that caused the market to fall when the 2008 and 2009 financial systems crashed.

My bitcoin node is making $1 a day. So that, in itself, is a small thing. In my opinion, if a lot more people want to use bitcoin as a currency, that is better. But right now, with the way it's developing and where the world is currently going, I think it's good, but still only a small thing.

I can only say this: the network is full of people and nodes that are busy and waiting.
Some do not like the idea of full nodes on the main network and that is ok. But a full node has to be able to handle all traffic on the network.

I just hope bitcoin price doesn't continue to soar like many people assume, but I really have not much confidence to make a prediction on bitcoin price this year.
It seems like the big people seem to have power there, and it's time for some people to stop being greedy, and try and see the larger picture and how things are going to get resolved.

Telling your parents you bought Bitcoin isn't a good idea.
I'm pretty certain many parents don't care about what you read. We are in a time when a lot has been made of crypto that is going to be seen as bad. Bitcoin is still quite anonymous, there's a bit of risk involved, so it's much easier to use as a medium of exchange, but with all this talk of Bitcoin being "the internet of money", isn't there plenty of opportunities to get around this? There's even a great paper by Alex Tabarrok at the Cointelegraph about these potential reasons for why children don't understand why a wallet will be used for anything other than money.
I'm all for giving children a wide range of choices, but if you want their input on any type of money, don't just make them guess. Get them to put their trust in you before asking for it, and then if they are unsure what a wallet is supposed to do - and you are in charge - ask them. Don't just get a bunch of people to do this one thing.
The best reason for children not to use Bitcoin because of your choices is because a lot of the developers in the ecosystem have a lot of problems with the system. It doesn't make sense. It doesn't fit their social agenda, and it isn't actually as secure.
@_date: 2019-05-31 14:20:45
I suspect this is something you can't fix. The problem you seem to be running into is where a double spend happens, where one transaction is done but that is then followed by a double spend by a different node (a single chain). This can happen when you run your testnet on top of one of these chain, and you have to send one of the transactions into your new testnet. For example, to pay something you do from this chain to some merchant or merchant site, then pay a deposit to that merchant using your testnet as normal.

That's what happened in the internet bubble. The bubble would have burst in 2005 if it wasn't for all that government money and that big banks were pushing so hard to keep a big chunk of people from getting out.
But the big banks will continue their bull runs, just as will everyone else. I've seen Bitcoin bubble up over 500 times and I've come to the same conclusion: it just will keep on coming.
@_date: 2019-05-31 00:24:13
Yes, but not for Bitcoin because of the potential downside of Bitcoin. It's quite likely your savings and income will be destroyed by the next drop in value. I would not recommend investing in lockboxes because it is hard to prove that all Bitcoin related operations aren't compromised. I would recommend an additional approach to diversifying the portfolio. Some funds that provide low risk, high return diversification may be a better idea than locking a Bitcoin deposit in your Bitcoin wallet.
@_date: 2019-05-30 22:23:29
Sorry, the maths might be a bit iffy, but the general point about the price of Bitcoin is that the market would have to have huge spikes to drive it up. We don't see signs of that at Bitcoin's current level, so it's impossible that any high-value Bitcoin users on Wall Street would suddenly switch to Bitcoin if the price went up again. There are many opinions out there on Bitcoin's markets. If you want an article about it, you can read one of Michael Lewis' "Why We Know Too Little" blogs, and the book "Dumbest Investment Mistake" by Hans Pumpkin.

I'm in the same boat, and I'm just waiting. A quick glance at my account, and the amount of coins I claim seems to be changing every day (for a long time).  However, I still did not receive any coin yet (not counting the one coin from my last transaction).
@_date: 2019-05-30 21:20:26
So you need $1,100 for every $10 you invest. What if Bitcoin is only $2,500? This also requires $1,100 for every $10 you invest. So each additional $2,500 is essentially putting up $10 for every $2,500 you had invested in Bitcoin. The problem is that there are so many other currencies you can get with Bitcoin you could buy. So if you have $1,400 in Bitcoin Cash, in order to get $1,100 of Bitcoin, you are actually adding $1,000, if it is $1,500. If it is only $1,200, you are subtracting, or you are dropping $200, $150, or even $100.
Now it is true that if you think of Bitcoin as being a computer program you will not be able to add Bitcoin directly into your bank account. This is because, just like if you bought the computer software, the computer program will never install itself. So if it is $5000 and you go to your bank and tell them they are going to accept Bitcoin, they will not. That is because the software will take over from the financial system, they will not accept Bitcoin, in order to continue operating, the Bitcoin is still on the computers.

Spot on, OP. It will help keep transactions free and secure for everyone. The blocks will not be full on the same chain. We will also be able to achieve the "least-confined" chain, so miners should never have to spend coin in order to mine it.
If people want this to happen please support the proposal. Donations would only pay for a short period of time to ensure everyone has their coins.
It should be possible for a node to mine all transactions, meaning it'd be possible for a single node to have 100% control over whether a transaction is valid or not. Transactions like the one above will never be sent to a miner. They will be just a few bytes on the block. If someone wants to mine on such a chain then that's fine. They don't need to mine that chain directly.
I'd consider that Bitcoin Core is now too centralized. This is all done behind closed doors so users are not informed of how to decide if they want to spend something they've already sent (or just want to store that part of it in their wallet). We've already lost trust in the block chain.
What if the chain is a public and it's only a small set of addresses and you want to create some transactions? We want to do that.

So Bitcoin mining would become an investment by default today, right? You'd be hard pressed to find a CEO or managing director who's not willing to go the risk-averse path to get there.
@_date: 2019-05-31 01:23:27
It would, but not their fear of being shut out of the system altogether. A better solution would be to introduce several levels of obfuscation to Bitcoin transactions on each layer that were included, thus forcing users to select between obfuscation methods as they like. The solution would make Bitcoin transactions transparent, but would not allow anyone to discover who was sending what or when, and how much.

Bitcoin market as a whole will continue to go through a "tipping point" where the price can rise to levels where it has to go further into a bear market. This means that investors may begin to sell more immediately, and this could be where the price is headed up.
In reality, many investors have seen this coming and have already taken steps to make some profits, such as selling directly to hedge funds but, as the price continues to move into bear territory, so may the market and the potential profits from it.

The world economy will not survive an extreme economic slowdown and we have been seeing evidence of this in recent months. The recent declines in stock prices are the last straw.
There has been no shortage of bullish signs for the past couple of months, not only in cryptocurrency markets, but throughout the broader asset class.
1) A rising market cap. As it is currently, Bitcoin does not really hold a global financial market, and is currently used primarily in remittance markets. That said, a new Chinese regulation restricting money transfers into Chinese markets will be a tough hit on Bitcoin's demand.
2) A greater amount of exposure to the US dollar, both in the short term and for long-term. While the volatility around the US dollar has had a negligible impact on Bitcoin's price, the recent increase in the dollar supply that was caused by Federal Reserve policy in April has caused Bitcoin's price to rise accordingly. While I consider Bitcoin to be an "intrinsic asset", if the Federal Reserve ever decides to print more US dollars, Bitcoin will remain susceptible to this increase, which will limit Bitcoin's value proposition.

I think that the biggest risk customers would be taking here is that such companies don't have trustworthy middle man. I think I'd be very much worried about the fact that all the transactions happen offline. If the transaction costs go up a lot, I think you know this will really create a bunch of problems if there isn't enough transparency around where the money is coming and what's going on here and who's doing it. And it would really expose these users to other risks; you lose trust; they lose access to their money.
You also have to think on whether your business model allows for that level of transparency. Right now, as the price goes up, that's the problem with your business model. In fact, that's where the real money is.
You have to be honest with every transaction you do. And the question is, how can investors be safe if you're not transparent to the users the way it's supposed to be?

FOMO is money going into a store of value that can quickly go into short term speculation or speculative withdrawal. This has often been associated with speculative gambles with short term investment plans.  We are all familiar with the term speculative gambler  when someone goes to gamble for their next big thing. If such people think that a new idea is the best idea then why don't we see some of these short term speculative gambles? This is where short term investment plans with short term vision do have value! 
In a similar vein it is very easy to spend your money buying and selling stock as soon as your idea becomes a reality.  And if you can get your ideas validated and validated with the confidence that you will own the ideas/ product in the future then your plan becomes a great opportunity to invest.  It is this kind of speculative investing that has caused me to become very short term speculative.

Nice video about Bitcoin basics, but your parents will hate it and think it's all hype. This video will not teach you how to convert Bitcoins, how to keep Bitcoin in your wallet, anything like that. It should be about Bitcoin and how it connects to the real world as well as the crypto world.
