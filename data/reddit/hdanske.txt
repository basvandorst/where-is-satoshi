In Europe, chip+pin got introduced decades ago (1986) and widely deployed in early 90es, like 1992 ? I can barely remember not having a chip card. Contactless is now the norm since 2 years ago, in UK, nordics, germany etc..
I know for a fact its like that in many parts of asia too, like S Korea and Japan.
The US is just lagging lightyears behind the rest of the world. I heard they still use cheques, haven't seen one of those in 30 years.

Block chain is just a Merkle tree - it's a practically ancient data structure in computer science. What it is, is a slow database using a tragically large amount of energy to "secure". Honestly, spending a country worth of electricity to "mine" is literally mindbogglingly irresponsible in a time of climate change.
There is nothing disruptive about block chain - it literally solves no problems for anyone - that can't better be solved by redundant databases, for a fraction if a fraction of a fraction of the energy cost of "distributed ledger" crap. So all these ICOs will die out. Literally, all of them.

Propped up with *what* ? Miners need money to pay bills, they don't have money to "prop it up". Tether has been revealed, and if Tether is wise, they should start packing and going to Panama or Mexico before they get escorted by US Marshals, from wherever they're hiding. 
This is the Exit Phase for Tether. They're running for the hills - and they clearly turned off their trading bots.

Which experts ? Only 6bn real USD has moved into all crypto. How would bitcoin go to 30k when the general public either think its a scam or dont give a damn. 30k is delusional.
The difference in mcap vs real money inflow shows the price should be dramatically lower. Sorry.

Until such blatant fraud is weeded out and cracked down on, crypto will never be taken seriously. There is a reason the stock, futures and commodity markets are heavily regulated and it is all for the benefit of the market and the participants.
Soon, these exchanges will find themselves in serious legal issues and that's not going to go well for the price of any of the coins they trade or the customers who will have funds frozen during investigations and trials. Potentially making the Mt.Gox incident look insignificant in comparison. 
I don't even know if there is an exchange that isn't shady, atleast to the point where it could pass a review and live up to increased oversight, as of today.

You're delusional. You are surrounded by people who validates your view. The fact is, BTC has almost 0 value - blockchain, can be forked. And if it actually turns out to have value, it will be forked, and any and all coins in alts or btc will be worthless and not the future. That is, a fact.

You do know what exponential functions are, and how, its not possible to go on for too many periods of doubling before theres less atoms in the visible universe than the USD price of a single coin? 
So, the question is not how much it grew, but how much room there is left - and if any asset class can out do it in the coming 10 years.

Doesn't matter if BTC has no real value. Remember:
HODL - Warren Buffettt HODLs and he is very rich - doesn't matter that he hodls tangible assets which produces value YOY, Bitcoin is a new paradigm that produces value out of internet magic! HODL HODL!
