Still waiting to collect my free garlic meme  :/

.... I think it’s time I read all those posts about mining GRLC
@_date: 2017-08-30 12:00:52
Definitely. Thank you, I'll be sure to educate myself better

I see that 1btc is a few thousand. I want to invest, do people typically start out with just 1 or 2?  
@_date: 2017-08-30 11:05:22
I just read that and felt kind of silly for not realizing it haha. What is the best way to go about it? I've done some quick research this morning and it seems like many websites and apps may be trying to prey on those getting into BTC and I'm not sure the best way to go about it. 
@_date: 2017-08-30 10:50:31
Sounds dumb, but what's the recommended way of buying? Just did a quick search, and I felt like websites are trying to rip people off. 
@_date: 2017-08-30 10:56:24
How does one get into crypto. Hate to sound ignorant, but I am very interested and don't want to make an easily avoidable mistake.

Wait a second, did you see that? Zoom in! Enhance!

That’s what I’m thinking too. So is there a general consensus that b2x will be worthless?  I don’t know the future of it and would hate to sell it off and it become something. 
@_date: 2017-10-24 17:51:27
Ok, that’s what I thought was going on. Thanks!
@_date: 2017-10-16 14:44:00
Cool thanks man. Do you know if gdax charges fees to withdraw BTC?
@_date: 2017-10-16 15:09:37
Awesome. Thanks for your help, brother! 
@_date: 2017-09-27 23:13:51
Out of curiosity, are you guys excited bc you are raking in so much from this rise or are we excited for the rise in general.  
I recently jumped on the train and at $4199.50 I’m at about $22 profit. I’m definitely in it for the long haul, but I want to know exactly why I should be excited haha
@_date: 2017-10-14 14:47:26
What does this mean? Haha I’m sorry man
@_date: 2017-10-24 17:05:54
I forgot to put my BTC in a wallet before Monday, and it’s been sitting in GDAX. Did I miss out on the bitcoin gold fork?  
@_date: 2017-10-14 15:36:26
Oh ok. Makes perfect sense. Thanks!
@_date: 2017-09-01 18:14:03
Which exchange do you use?
@_date: 2017-10-24 17:04:46
I remember reading about investments a few years ago. Whatever I was reading stated that you should invest in something you are passionate about. Not because you like it, but because you will understand the nuances and trends of the investment. I think that’s the idea here.
You are correct in saying that knowing when to buy/sell is important if you want to make money, but you must understand before you can make true, educated decisions.  One may be incorrect, but there’s a level of knowledge you must have about bitcoin before you start buying and selling based on what our sub is saying. I think most people want a quick way to get rich, and it is totally possible, but it is safer and still profitable to learn about what’s going on here. I’m still learning at the moment.

So should I return my trezor I just bought from Amazon and buy the nano instead? I’m not attached to either, just want to buy the best one 
@_date: 2017-10-14 23:32:40
Dang it. I JUST bought a Trezor. I hope it will support them. 
@_date: 2017-10-24 19:53:58
Are you still trading in the Tech industry?  I recently have been making enough where I feel comfortable with entering trading. 
@_date: 2017-09-28 12:08:09
Cool. I like the way you put it. 
@_date: 2017-10-14 23:46:45
It’s crazy, but we’re early adopters of something groundbreaking. It’ll be fun to tell stories about it.  I’ve learned so much since buying. 
@_date: 2017-10-16 12:49:50
I don’t really care, but I got the trezor for $2 more than the nano s. I thought it might be a good deal. 
@_date: 2017-10-24 19:55:16
I educated my father in law about bitcoin last night. He’s retired now and from what he’s seen on tv he’s still intimidated. He also is very comfortable. So I don’t really care to make him feel pressured. 
@_date: 2017-10-16 12:49:08
I’ve heard something about fees. Does trezor charge you to put things in your wallet? 
@_date: 2017-10-14 14:24:03
Can you explain a sell wall for me?  I use gdax on mobile and idk what I’m supposed to be looking at to understand what a wall is and what it looks like.
