No, of course not. Obama was commonly known by Hispanic communities as "the deportation president" because he took such a hard line on immigration, even if focusing primarily on people with violent criminal history.
But the Obama administration did not implement a "zero-tolerance" policy that treats all first time offenders of crossing the border illegally, which is a misdemeanor, as a federal offense, only repeat crossers. They would also deport families as a unit rather than separating them, however separations under certain circumstances still took place.
Things in reality have nuance. Painting the two with a broad enough brush to call them the same is intellectually dishonest. And to be frank, I was outraged when Obama did it, but I'm *furious* about the infants and children being separated from their parents.

Run BOINC and associate it with your Gridcoin account and no one would be the wiser. BOINC is very innocuous and arguably contributes toward the advancement of the sciences, too. Might as well put the hash power to good use.
You wouldn't be able to mine Bitcoin because the hashpower would be a drop in the bucket, and I'm assuming work computers probably wouldn't have a slick gpu, either. If they're good GPU's that's different, but most work computers are ancient.

You don't have any logical problem with declaring something made up before it happens? I understand the cynicism, but grand jury indictments are serious business. At the very least you should be open to listening to the details when they are presented.
@_date: 2018-02-20 20:28:46
I'm not expecting to convince you to turn your life around right here, right now. But when that epiphany hits again, because the truth doesn't allow us to stay blind forever, just think long and hard, for your own sake. There are better outlets for your consternation. We all carry our own burdens, but dealing with the problems in our life directly is the best path toward contentment.

It means evidence is there and we'll all have to be a little more patient until it's made public.
So far the indictments do indicate cyber crimes by 13 Russian individuals but also the only guilty pleas include mere lying to the FBI. Until more comes out we can't say much for sure, but saying "zero evidence" is ludicrous. The guilty pleas and indictments *are* evidence, but we'll have to wait on their meaning.
@_date: 2018-02-13 18:06:39
As a public business, you can't discriminate against others based on several protected classes. The fact that some backwards states do not consider sexual orientation a protected class is only a matter of being behind the times.
You don't get to refuse service to a black customer for being born black. You don't get to refuse service to a gay customer for being born gay. The laws will catch up to this century when the neanderthals get voted out.

It's a public-facing business, not a private one. You're factually incorrect in the classification. It's owned by a private entity but operates publicly. That's a legal classification.

Here is why Bcash is not a good investment:
1. It's centralized between a very small group. [Here's a user that demonstrates how the mining hash power is coming from too few sources to claim decentralization
]( It's five months old, but if you double check the blocks the same way this user did then you'll see that BCash is still susceptible to a 51% attack. This is to be expected since Segwit renders Bitmain Antminer hardware obsolete, so all their hashpower has to go somewhere, so it's all going to Bcash now instead of Bitcoin.
2. It has no significant development on its 4 Githubs. It's unlikely they could implement Lightning Network even if they wanted to, and it's also unlikely they'll adopt future Bitcoin innovations, too. There's simply no progress being made. One of the four Githubs actually has activity in it, but that's because it's behind and is only coming into parity with the other accounts. Bitcoin has all the developers and all the innovation between the two. That's a *huge* issue.
3. Increasing blocksize to 8mb is quickly showing to be a short-term solution to scaling and a hardfork toward a 16mb blocksize is already on the horizon
4. They claim faster times and lower fees yet handles a mere fraction of the network traffic compared to bitcoin. Even Dogecoin has cheap transaction costs. That doesn't mean anything when your network is empty. I use Litecoin to transfer funds because at least it's not open to a 51% attack like Bcash, and transaction times are comparable.
5. They named their coin Bitcoin Cash to confuse market outsiders who buy Futures contracts or Cash of an item (Bitcoin Futures / Bitcoin Cash for btc, Bitcoin Cash Futures / Bitcoin Cash Cash for bcc/bch). The reason the name is an issue is because they did it with the intent to deceive. Whether or not they have the right to do so is irrelevant when you consider they did it for nefarious reasons. Anyone who values their investment should see it immediately as a red flag. Deceptive business practices are a non-starter for an investor looking to mitigate risk.
I'm not an engineer, however, so I can't say anything for certain. However, if I have to throw my hat in the ring with either team, the team I have faith in is the one who never tried to monopolize the network with manufactured ASIC's, smear tactics, and shady naming practices.
This is why everyone who knows what they're talking about is so aggressively against Bcash. There is no argument *for* Bcash.

It's an extreme-minority theory but it's possible. More likely is that cooking meat allowed for more free time, which led to the ability for creativity in general contexts (not just survival) to be advantageous and then was bred into us with sexual selection. This would have been closer to a couple million years ago, well before modern humans and closer to our split with chimpanzees.

Could be baseless from this spokesperson's position, but not a baseless statement from the OP since there's an official source. Sorry for not being specific.

Anatomically modern humans have only been around for 250,000 years by generous estimates, and since cannabis originates from Pakistan area (IIRC) it's unlikely that modern humans encountered them before leaving Africa 70,000 years ago (in the biggest wave, some of which did leave as early as 250,000 years ago and then again around 115,000 years ago). The cannabis would also be very different than what you would see today, as it's had tens of thousands of years of selective breeding since then, so it's hard to say that they encountered cannabis in the sense that would satisfy the premise.

Except we're talking about causation and the predominant variables. They aren't mutually exclusive but one is much, much more likely to be that predominant variable.
One theory has a large majority consensus and the other has a mere handful of academics who have ever written seriously about the theory and even then not all of them agree on it.
Additionally, the phenomenon caused by ingesting psilocybin mushrooms is an act that inhibits some neurological activity in the limbic system but *does not* affect the underlying genetic code, so any effects would be to a single generation. It's also not found in a lot of places in Africa that would place it in the same areas as Homo habilis or other pre-human ancestors. 
The theory is interesting but lacks sufficient evidence to make it credible.
@_date: 2018-04-07 21:11:56
Of course psychedelics affect your brain and cognition, no one would use it if they didn't. LSD has been shown in some studies to be beneficial at treating addiction, and psilocybin mushrooms have been shown in a preponderance of studies to be an effective instrument in treating depression and end-of-life anxieties. 
Your post did nothing to further your point about evolution, however. There is simply no evidence that psychedelics contributed to the cognitive evolution of humans or pre-humans. Full stop.
