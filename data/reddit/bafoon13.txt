is right, typically there are a few locations to place the bottles. The point is to transfer heat to your large arteries. As blood pumps through these locations, your entire body will begin to warm up. The most common locations are under the groin for their femoral artery (legs), under the armpits (like you mentioned) for their brachial artery (arms), and on the neck for their carotid artery (neck/head).

Typically body to body heat transfer only works for very mild cases. If the person is alive, then as long as no more heat is lost then they'll remain alive, so that should be the first strategy. As you mentioned, it's also important to remove wet clothing (especially if it's cotton since cotton literally sucks all the heat from your body when wet). In this situation where there is no hot water your first priority is preventing further heat loss (via the blankets) and then the next best thing to do is feed them simple sugars (chocolate, jello, etc.). This acts as the best short term fuel that your body will instantly turn into body heat. If none of those things work and the patient's symptoms continue to get worse, then that probably means they are still losing too much heat and it's time to give body to body heat transfer as a try as a last resort.

You are not supposed to "cuddle" with someone who has hypothermia. That is much more likely to make both people hypothermic than to warm the other up. Instead, you should put warm water bottles right below their crotch and then create a hypothermia wrap which is similar to wrapping them in a lot of blankets and sleeping bags.
