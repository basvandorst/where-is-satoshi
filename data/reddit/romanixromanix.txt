They want either invoice or bank payment slip with amount and currency.

It's about "insufficient information about the value". But down in the document there are some checkboxes. There they ask for invoice or bank payment slip.

The seller's email confirmation contains information similar to this:
We've received 0.5171 BTC to 1NdhFVrnbKkRbqxuuN2hCjZNTXLK5ZLrBc.
And blockchain.info lists only one Bitcoin transaction for the relevant date to this address.

Yes, I guess so as well. What makes it interesting is that the documents they ask for don't exist for this case or do only show BTC amounts.

Banking license acts as a competitive advantage for those companies that  have one.... and to avoid fierce competition. Is that the kind of bitcoin ecosystem we wanted?

I agree.
In addition to that I'd say that bitcoin lost traction and focus when some bitcoin people said nonsense like "bitcoin is all about the other 6 billions". 
Bitcoin is excellent to pay off-shore developers - at least as long as they are willing to be paid in bitcoin.
Be aware that the  traditional payments systems could speed up their transactions and lower their fees as well.

Adding BTC-e makes absolute sense. BTC-e has often the best ask price (sell orders). Also it often has vast amounts of small sell orders. 
During the last couple of days itBit has even better ask prices for order sizes over $1000.

Is there a better conference schedule than this one? I'd prefer a shared Google calendar with those entries...

hey Cab000se
What is your use case for seeing deeper into the orderbooks? Deeper in the books means further away from the market price. Until now we assumed that this is not so interesting. 
Our main use case is to filter for big order sizes - that would imply liquidity.
 
However, it often seems that btc-e has huge amounts of small sell orders.

What was the implication on the land titles registered in Bitcoin's blockchain if the company Factom did disappear?

As of today (Jan 10th) the bitstamp user interface has nothing regarding multisig or additional signing by the user or so. As user you don't see anything multisig related ... at least I couldn't find anything.

Kraken seems to have huge Bitcoin/USD spreads! The current bid - ask spead is incredible $28. Bitcoin/EUR spreads look better though (~1 EUR). Also it seems that their liquidity is poor, they have no big orders.

Does this protect against a Mt.Gox like fraud by a bitstamp employee? 
Do you expect that they have a time delay before Bitgo signs with their key? 
With such a delay bitstamp had a chance to call bitgo and tell them not to sign a  19,000 btc transaction....  or 19,000x 1 btc transactions. That would be the approach in today's banks.

The orderbook.info website shows the spread between major bitcoin exchanges. Currently the max. spread is between kraken and bitfinex. It's USD 7.87 for a volume of USD 3,989.

Hi gubatron,


Only some IT guys in banks and some investment bankers get it. But many of them are busy with regulatory topics in the non-blockchain world.

BIS.org is an organisation that produces good stuff. Also they are quite critical of ultra low interest rates, ZIRP and NIRP and derivatives. As an example:
Central banks and the global debt overhang

Bitcoin lacks focus. 
It seems that the community tries to solve too many different problems with Bitcoin.
In 2012 or so I was attracted to Bitcoin because it represented "digital scarce good" and seemed to be a digital store of value - similar to gold. The story was very compelling.
Then came Mr. Antonopoulos and proclaimed that Bitcoin was all about "the unbanked" and "the other 6 billions.", and also that the price of Bitcoin was not  important.

Yes, two important features as a start. 
In case Bitcoin users recognize fraud because of Bitcoin XT's double spend detection feature, it was worth the effort. Also it makes sense if decentralized blockchain applications like Lighthouse are only possible with some patches.
It seems to be a way to extend and patch thee Bitcoin network without waiting on slow Bitcoin Core improvements.
