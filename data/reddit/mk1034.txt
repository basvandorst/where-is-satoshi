I have a feeling that there are a lot of people out there with the same exact mindset. It makes me wonder what will happen should 1BTC eventually reach the value of $20k+ or even higher. As the potential for any one person owning a single coin gets harder and harder to achieve, will the newer adopters feel more discouraged from entering as well?  
I'd say we're already reaching that point and if it weren't for the looming fork coming up soon, the price would barely be half as much as it is now. It'll be really interesting to see the price fluctuations the weeks after the fork and the staying power of the 'moon' or if we'll all have to hitch a ride back down to Earth.

I mean, it already does look like a kid's playground squabble.

Here I was making a silly joke. Little did I know some parts of reddit take silly little jokes to an entirely new level. That result is pretty funny though.

I looked it up and it looks pretty good. Definitely out of my price range should I ever consider getting one. Which is also probably why is see &lt;10 minute flight times on anything I might consider a reasonable purchase. Everyone has hobbies and interests though.

If you plan on buying more in the future, look into GDAX. It's still coinbase, but the fees are nonexistent for limit orders. It's a tiny bit more work but saves you so much more in the long run.

1BTC doesn't need to equal hundreds of thousands of dollars. The point of it is to have an unregulated and free currency that one can use wherever they wish and be in complete control of. Yes, the constant rise of price is great, especially in terms of investment thinking, but that wasn't the initial role it was created for. People are just getting greedy because they want to become millionaires overnight and thinking this is a magic ticket to that.

I'll need a legal document for that statement of yours. This sub seems full of people offering to eat things based on outcomes, I think it's time we start holding them to those.

Can confirm, traded my girlfriend for .25BTC. She didn't believe in my investments. Now who's laughing?

Tell that to the large number of people subscribed to this sub that condescend anyone that purchases something with their bitcoin.  


Literally every post anyone is happy over something they were able to treat themselves to thanks to Bitcoin will have that comment.

Looks like someone just dumped a large chunk of coin and cashed out I'm guessing?

What kind did you get? I have a coworker that's really into them and he brought in some super cheap ones to work once to let us mess around with (he has much higher quality racing drones that obviously aren't noob friendly as well) and it was pretty fun to mess around with. The main thing stopping me from ever getting one right now is the horrid battery life vs flight time. Especially for ones with cameras and flight goggle setups.

If it's always inconvenient and no one wants to pay fees, then large scale adoption will never happen. Bitcoin needs to actually be used if it ever wants to be viewed as an actual currency and not just a transfer or currency exchange service.
