Your logic is sound until history and physical value comes into place. Gold has been a store of value for thousands of years because it has a purpose and is rare. Bitcoin outside of transaction verification has no real purpose. Its a purely speculative asset and is only worth x because people think it is. A stock has value because of the company under it. Gold has value because it is a rarish element and is used in many tasks.

Power outage, weather event, political event. There is a multitude of events that can cause 1 or 2 major mining hubs to stop for a few hours.

Have you ever looked at macroeconomic theory and why no bank has ever chased deflationary currency? It's not an advantage

So if the transaction isn't going on the chain and is run over the top. Why wouldnt you simply use a well established system like eft anyway.

Don't need to. Chinas mining hubs control a majority, major event there will increase tx cost to ridiculous levels if you can even get one. When has an eft cost ever changed?

Seriously? I've already given you reasons and a timeframe why I can't give evidence conclusively yet. But being as your acting like a small child and will soon degrade to dissecting my grammar to continue the argument, I have finished with your chirade of pointless, repetitive arguments for argument sake. Your lack of logic for someone with as high assumed knowledge as you portray with hylerlinks and jargon is astounding and so is the depth at which you reach to continue a pointless argument of which you are yet to reach a conclusive discussion outside of a childhood reminisce "Prove it, nah don't belive you".

Walkinshaw are a factory tuner for Holden. They are as for all purposes OEM. How have I moved the goal posts? My original statement and logic is coherent throughout our discussion. What Tesla has done is a regular and legal practice for vehicle manufacturers. The difference is that Tesla are an all electric highly computerised vehicle able to handle software changes on the fly. Most other manufacturers are 5 years behind that.  Regarding evidence I'm currently traveling but once I am on a desktop I will happily show you.
@_date: 2017-11-17 13:37:34
So you typed well over a hundred words and made no point outside of you don't know. Again whether you believe it or not, there are other companies that have done similar if not exactly the same thing. Any other line of thinking is out right rediculous. Your going around in circles attempting to display some output of valid reasoning without any deductive attempts to prove it.
 Simply saying I'm wrong when its logical to say that in over 3 decades of electronic operation in cars Tesla is not the first to use software to limit an options availabilty to the customer. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 09:17:22
Yes, but you are being facetious. You know full well the meaning of what I said because your 2nd point responds to it. Other manufacturers use the same engine with different hp outputs which are as simple as a remap to change which being as Tesla vehicles are all electric is relevant. Many others allow you to purchase options in-store after initial purchase so why is Teslas option any different?
@_date: 2017-11-17 11:34:58
No, the correct term is an OEM Options dealer. Once I am home I can happily scan to you the brochure of a factory commodore from Holden listing the options from Walkinshaw, a list in the same brochure as Holden's options. Also they don't purely rebuild vehicles they can do option packages coinciding with options from Holden. So unfortunately you're incorrect in that part.
Regarding my original statement, of course they do seperate sized Amp/hr packs for their range of vehicle classes. But for a single vehicle model, a single battery package is the most cost effective option. No car manufacturer installs 4 different types of fuel tanks for 4 different options levels on vehicles, so why being battery packs are fuel tanks for electric cars would Tesla do any different?
To continue with the discussion points I have brought in every single comment thus far. Show me another all electric vehicle that is semi autonomous and highly computerized? I know for a fact many Mercedes models, BMW models both have many options that a simple software install will allow use. Even most lower value cars have options that software will allow the upgrade to be used. Sat Nav is an obvious upgrade. Most vehicles have the facilities from the middle models up, some require a simple software update to access it. 
You speak of changing goal posts yet in your last paragraph you talk about going from a base package to a top of the line. Even in ICE powered cars this is clutching at straws. Nowhere have I spoken about going from a 30,000 base model car to a 70000 top of the line car. Tesla's upgrade option is not like going from a 2ltr 4cyl to a 7ltr 600hp v8. You seem to be creating strawmen to simply attack my valid point without ever countering the argument with your own. So i return the question, what is your issue in a free global market of a manufacturer with hundreds of millions of cost in RnD, creating a system of ease of install and a simple process for those willing to pay to be able to ascertain an upgrade? 
My personal favourite part of this whole discussion is yourself saying "Tesla would actually install a larger pack and software limit it to a lower capacity as Its cheaper to produce one battery pack and software lock it , than to produce and install a lower capacity pack.". So now we have proven your simply being argumentative for some petty reason beyond comprehension I think our discussion is done. So best of luck on your internet argument endeavours.
@_date: 2017-11-17 05:44:01
Doesn't change what I'm saying any more relevant or true. We live in a capitalist society and its a business. There would be costing reasons why and you pay for the lower model you get lower options.

Walkinshaw in Australia happily takes any commodore to upgrade. Most dealerships with special models are happy to upgrade components to upgraded components from a higher model dependant on difficulty. I have 2 friends which have sent in cars 1 and 1.5 years after purchase for additions from the oem dealer.
Your also comparing an all electric car with an ICE car. Of course the difference in upgrades are software dependant
 Again I will bring you back to simple economics of Business. They are a business to make profit, you design a car as simple as simple as possible irrelevant to the options levels which invariably can be different in different countries this simplifies manufacture and lowers compontry cost. You then make upgrades as easy and cost effective to do so that when a customer pays for an upgrade you make a significant amount of profit combating the RnD of the vehicle. 
You are also are incorrect as i know for a fact 2 major local manufacturers models have series that apart from cosmetic differences the hp change is a tune and the drivetrain is the same and again because of my above point - Cost.
@_date: 2017-11-17 05:07:29
They make 1 battery bank type and when you pay extra you get more kwh unlocked. Its logical to manufacture only minimum differences in components, all car manufacturers do similar things.

Its not supply and demand. Its speculation of growth of an asset 80% of people have no idea about. Don't get me wrong its great. But its only a matter of time before it peaks and falls. Btc has seen 90% falls, can you say a fall like that now wouldn't destroy its long term perspective.
@_date: 2017-11-17 12:49:05
Again, your being argumentative for arguments sake while in other posts agreeing with every point outside of similar manufacturer's doing the same. A simple point you have taken great steps to avoid is the fact that there isn't another all electric manufacturer like Tesla. You also used a definition that dependant on your opinion I am correct - having characteristics in common. There without a doubt whether you believe it or not are vehicles ICE powered that a software upgrade is the difference between power levels. Aftermarker tuners literally make money from this fact without differing anything like you say are reasons behind GM lowering hp output.

Exactly, blockchain has its place but people are delusional thinking BTC is going to become as well used as Fiat. It doesn't make sense economically or practically. 
@_date: 2017-10-29 10:52:53
How so? BTC has no backing and is free from the risk of failing. That makes no sense. If a company with a hundred years of stable earnings has a chance of failing a currency dependant on software has just as much or more. The first time someone manages to hack the network the price will plummit like never before seen.
