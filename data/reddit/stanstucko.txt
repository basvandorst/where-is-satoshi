You can't dispute any item you purchased with BTC 30 days ago, with or without full-RBF.


They know they're getting chargebacks from fraudsters, but average people also do chargebacks. Some out of buyer's remorse, embarrassment. Maybe you just didn't like the product, or felt ripped off. None of these causes for doing a chargeback is likely to happen in the 10 minute time window immediately following a purchase.
Only hackers, and serial online payment fraudsters, are an issue with RBF as it relates to 0-conf. B&amp;M payments 0-conf is still secure with the usual cameras and know-your-customer. And of course [LN solves instant 0-conf payment security](
@_date: 2015-06-30 15:41:51
Do you own a B&amp;M business accepting Bitcoin? What are you selling? If in the future, everyone kept a 12-month rolling multisig balance on the [Lightning Network]( wouldn't that definitively solve instant 0-conf security for you?
@_date: 2015-06-30 16:36:56
For non-English speakers: B&amp;M = Brick &amp; Mortar, Brick &amp; Mortar = gas station, Walmart, etc. B&amp;M businesses almost all have customers on camera to prevent fraud and theft. How is RBF *any* different?
Online services like Streamium that deliver items instantly upon payment, are already relying on payment channels to work with instant 0-conf security. For bigger ticket online purchases, and exchange deposits, the business is going to require 1 confirmation minimum, usually 3 minimum for exchanges.
And yeah, I want UNDO SEND in my wallet. It's clearly more user friendly than "Click a mouse, lose a house".
@_date: 2015-06-30 17:49:59


When's the last time you walked into a convenience store with no cameras?
B&amp;M merchants almost universally have video based security systems deployed. It's the *present reality*.


I've provided example after example ITT of real world use cases that may *at first* seem to be disrupted by RBF, but which actually aren't disrupted by it at all in reality. Care to give some counter examples?

@_date: 2015-06-29 14:59:16
Cameras and knowing your customer. That's how you protect against 0-conf fraud blockchain payments in B&amp;M retail settings. Online, it seems streaming payments would be easier to double-spend 0-conf, but [Streamium]( has found payment channels a much better fit for their usage. Payment channels make instant 0-conf payments secure.
With this in mind, wouldn't it be a benefit for your wallet to have an emergency UNDO PAYMENT button? Have you ever sent BTC to the wrong address accidentally? It's heart-pounding, OMFG I just lost $100s of dollars, type of excitement. People have lost tens of thousands of dollars this way. Full RBF allows you to do Edit-&gt;Undo in your wallet after you send a payment, which can make a very big impact on Bitcoin's user friendliness.
In summary, if you're only trusting 0 conf for face-to-face transactions anyway, you can presumably guard against double-spending the same way you guard against petty theft. Know the person you're transacting with, or get them on camera. You can get [finality and security of 0-conf with Lightning]( Only 500 views, despite it being a world changing video about how LN is the way forward for Bitcoin.
Am I leaving out any use cases that are destroyed by RBF? Certainly streaming payments, but that's a moot point since micropayments are tiny and better served through payment channels, as are merchants needing instant 0-conf.
@_date: 2015-06-30 15:52:03
You'd keep a 6 or 12 month rolling balance in multisig for LN, and use that to make payments to any address. [As described by the LN authors](

@_date: 2015-06-30 18:28:04


It was a highly spurious claim the first time you made it.
Quoting Coinbase docs:


TLDR: Coinbase has "systems" for *estimating the likelihood of double-spends*. That likelihood, according to their systems, may be 1%. Their systems may fail. So if you claim to need 100% certainty of instant payments, which is impossible even with credit cards, you shouldn't be in business at all. No system is perfect.
And certainly no company who demands perfect certainty should be accepting bitcoin payments. Except in Greece. Or except when they want to save on processing fees. Or except when they want exposure to BTC currency. Etc etc. Which is why your premise is so flawed, quote:


All merchants deal with chargebacks. Let's compare apples to apples. Fraudulent RBF double-spends are equivalent to chargebacks. No merchant is 100% sure a customer's payment is "cleared" until after the refund and chargeback windows have expired. They may be 99% sure they're getting the customer's money, but not 100% sure until those windows have passed. In the case of credit card payments, that's a 30-90 day window of uncertainty. In Bitcoin RBF's case, it's a 10 minute window, at worst!
And if you need 100% certainty in instant 0-conf payments, you shouldn't be trusting 0-conf Bitcoin payments at all, because it's impossible to deliver that guarantee without payment channels like [Lightning](

@_date: 2015-06-30 15:31:39
What about going to jail for fraud or theft? Especially when you're on camera making the payment, just seems silly to think people would risk it in droves.
Today you can go out and bounce 100 checks at every cash/check only merchant in your city, and you could also go to jail. Just because a double spend is equally as feasible doesn't mean people will do it.

1. Lightning [already exists]( in pre-alpha form

Watch the presentation the authors gave to SF Bitcoin Devs, it's unquestionably the future of daily Bitcoin payments: 
@_date: 2015-06-30 20:57:36
I misunderstood the context of the word "client" here:


If the merchant's *wallet* sees your attempt to double spend away, the merchant's wallet can automatically submit another tx with an even higher fee spending the unconfirmed inputs? Yes, I agree that makes sense.
How viable is it to broadcast transactions spending unconfirmed inputs? Either way, it puts a dent in full-RBF.

Your ERP company could just integrate Bitcoin into its user interface. It's certainly not going to become a $5M expense for every individual merchant.


Can fiat currency be *instantly* deposited into your bank account after you receive a 0-conf BTC payment through Coinbase or BitPay? How sure are you that Coinbase works like that in practice?
Conversely, Streamium.io is a clear example of an online merchant needing instant 0-conf security, and they're achieving this with payment channels. With the Lightning Network, you'd keep a 6 or 12 month rolling balance in multisig, and use that to make payments to any address. [As described by the LN authors](
@_date: 2015-06-30 20:23:19


Having never heard this claim before, can you explain further? I'm under the impression only the user *signing and broadcasting* the original transaction could undo the transaction with a higher fee. So who is this "someone" you speak of, if not for the customer?


If cryptocurrencies are popularly adopted, I don't see this playing itself out in reality. It comes down to is your net worth in Bitcoin, or something else. There may be room for "indifference" today with the wide discrepancy in userbase between cryptocurrency and fiat, but perhaps not in the future.
@_date: 2015-06-30 20:35:47
I don't get it. How could an unrelated third party "steal" the unconfirmed coins? Are you suggesting any unconfirmed BTC payment could be hijacked by anyone?
I'm very confident that only the customer could re-spend his unconfirmed coins by re-signing and re-broadcasting the tx with a higher fee, which makes sense because you need the private keys to sign the tx with the higher fee included.

The authors of Lightning spoke at SF Bitcoin Devs: 
If you can come away from watching [this video]( not believing LN or something similar will play a dominant role in daily Bitcoin payments in a couple years, you are clearly in denial over what is the most credible and scalable expansion plan Bitcoin has seen to date.
You could even be issued a credit card like instrument on top of LN. Credit + Bitcoin = free money for people = mass adoption. With instant confirmations set on top of the most secure and decentralized ledger there is, this global currency becomes a roaring success.

@_date: 2015-06-30 16:52:28
No, not if the userbase is growing it can't. What happens when 20MB blocks are jammed full, and Bitcoin's userbase is 20X the size of today? We'd be in the same situation, except with 20X the pressure on Electrum server.
@_date: 2015-06-30 14:46:20
Have you ever sent BTC to the wrong address? It's a show stopper. With RBF, your wallet could have an UNDO SEND button in case of emergency. And it's not like RBF makes B&amp;M 0-conf any harder. You do the payment in front of a camera, like you do already. What's the BFD?
@_date: 2015-07-02 00:08:31
Since we're on the topic of conflict of interest:
1. Chain.com, BlockCypher.com, Gem.com and other hosted full node API services profit by gaining more customers the harder it is for their customers to deploy full nodes
2. All "Bitcoin 2.0" companies live or die based on how viable it is to stuff data into the blockchain, the cheaper the better, the bigger the better
3. All commercially driven BitcoinJ projects, the most notable example being MultiBit, profit the easier it is to make on-chain transactions and the harder it is to run a full node - MultiBit now charges 1000 Satoshis per transaction.
SPV wallets in general benefit from bigger blocks, because it makes it as hard as possible on their users to switch to more private and secure full node alternatives.
You will also dully note how common it is for investors in Bitcoin 2.0 projects to shill like crazy on Reddit. You will also dully note the tremendous amount of animosity that exists between Blockstream and the current batch of Bitcoin 2.0 companies that are almost universally going to be upended by sidechains if they become popularly useful.
Many Bitcoin 2.0 companies, and companies like BlockCypher and Gem have raised millions upon millions of dollars, and they are on the hook to their investors if the block size isn't increased to make way for their business models.
Remember at one time horse drawn carriage companies represented "the economic majority". That doesn't mean we should prop them up in the face of clearly superior technologies.
@_date: 2015-07-02 20:28:43


Things no sane person ever says:
- "I'm so happy your software is a giant resource hog."
- "Thankfully your software is as costly to run as possible - the costlier the better!"
OTOH, if you were Gem.com, Chain.com, or BlockCypher.com maybe you *would* want it to be as costly as possible for people to run full nodes. The harder it is for everyone else to run a full node, the more people are forced into choosing your paid, centralized and proprietary services.
And if you designed an SPV wallet you would *also* want it to be as costly as possible for people to run full nodes. The higher the cost of running a full node, the more unrealistic it is for people to escape SPV for more secure and private full node alternatives.
@_date: 2015-07-02 00:21:24
Look, there are two ways to deal with additional resources
1. run a leaner and more optimal performance profile with what you have
2. max out what you have to add additional capacity.
Yes, LN remains to be seen, but it's theoretically possible to provide the entire world with access to BTC proper with ~200MB blocks. At 200MB blocks in the year 2040, everyone, from average users to miners, could be running full nodes instead of SPV wallets. This clearly makes for a more robust and resilient network.
It's like if you get a new, 10X more powerful toilet is your first thought to eat 10X more steak to excrete 10X the shit into that toilet, or do you not doing anything, and function with a more reliable toilet. The majority of core developers have been arguing relentlessly that our toilet is already in dilapidated condition, and that we need performance upgrades just to keep using it. If you disagree, argue it on the ML or STFU.
What if instead of flushing every increase in bandwidth and processing power, we slow it down to allow full nodes to catch up with SPV wallets in terms of speed and ease of use? Short term pain, long term benefit.

I'm more concerned about blacklisting addresses substituting for civil asset forfeiture. Theft by the state is worse than having no privacy, because then you have no control over your wealth. Lifting the 21,000,000 limit as some megablockers advocate for is equally as terrible, it still leads to government theft and you having no control over your wealth. Both completely defeat the purpose of having Bitcoin.

@_date: 2015-07-01 23:33:03
Great analogy.
Interestingly, debasing the 21M supply cap, and blacklisting are huge threats to this image of Bitcoin. BTC can act as a better gold with a very minimal block size, and it would preserve its intrinsic value much better that way.
Minimizing blockchain size for fluourishing number of full nodes is the single most important factor in preventing debasement of the supply cap and blacklisting funds.
@_date: 2015-07-01 19:10:16
I'm glad you had the balls to post this.
The key to Bitcoin is its unseizability and the government's inability to debase it.
Sure, your privacy could be screwed if you're not careful, but that's not what's important. Global money outside the clutches of political whim is still the ultimate safe haven investment.
But importantly, if Bitcoin's 21,000,000 supply cap can be lifted by political whim no matter how politically appealing the circumstances, one wonders how Bitcoin is any different from sheer tyranny: politicians could steal your BTC from you without your consent by debasing the supply cap. Politicians could also enforce redlisting or blacklisting through political whim, so that if you sin against the State, your money is frozen permanently and you have no recourse.
You want to know why full nodes are important to use on home desktop PCs? It's because it prevents tyranny more effectively than any other means. **This above all else is why full nodes preserve the intrinsic value of BTC**.
@_date: 2015-07-02 21:12:17


Really? You don't think 21M is untouchable? Color me shocked that you want megablocks.
I know there are some like you who would rather debase my savings. Reach into my wallet and steal everything you possibly can get away with based solely on political whim.
That's why I want as many people running full nodes as possible: to prevent tyranny of the masses. People don't realize that newcomers with very few if any BTC held in savings are going to be **all aboard** on stripping you of your BTC savings. They'll use the same exact playbook Mike Hearn is using right now to force his will upon the entire network. This has to be defended against at all costs, and I'm 100% willing to permanently fork the network over it. We will use the nuclear option. It's that important.


As I and countless core devs have been saying, endlessly, relentlessly - the situation with Bitcoin full nodes today is looking extremely bleak. Devs have been working tirelessly just to keep Bitcoin afloat at 1MB blocks. Ironically, *their* efforts at keeping Bitcoin afloat have given their political opponents the ammunition to increase the block size even further.

1. Presumably you lack written contracts from ISPs explicitly guaranteeing service levels exponentially higher than today's service levels.
2. Presumably you lack any proof that these upgrades are being rolled out to hundreds of millions, or billions of people today, or next year or in five years even.

1. With LN, you'd open a 6-12 month payment channel and use your balance from LN. 3-4 channels per year per person is plenty. Billions of people may never need to withdraw any BTC funds from LN into cold storage, ever. That's only necessary if you have savings. Most people do not have any savings at all, and live paycheck to paycheck.
2. You mean *affordably* open 3-4 per year. If you pay the fees, you can open and close as many channels as you want as frequently as you want. And why would you need to do this? You keep the bulk of your BTC in cold storage, do you not? Just keep $2000 in LN for 12 months at a time. It costs you not more than a miner's fee if you don't spend any of it, and you're guaranteed to get time locked funds refunded back; or you could just roll-over to a new LN plan.
3. At worst, give people 300MB blocks in 2040. It's still several orders of magnitude lighter weight than 8GB blocks.


If you're against central planning, you should want everyone running full nodes instead of SPV wallets, which is an absolute certainty in the year 2040 if the main blockchain is kept lightweight and usable, and we in fact do see Moore's Law take effect. Moore's Law is by no means guaranteed, and we could just as easily look back at our conservatism with a sense of immense relief for having averted total disaster.
We can *centrally decide* that Moore's Law and Nielsen's Law are laws of nature, and to dive head first into 8GB blocks in 2040, right now. How is that not centrally planned?

I'm aware it's more important to BTC's value, as far as families in Venezuela who desperately need to escape capital controls are concerned, to be 100% certain their BTC cannot be debased or frozen by political whim. That is the case only when there are millions or billions of people running full nodes. At that point, no controversial changes to Bitcoin can be forced upon the network. Removing the 21M coin supply cap by political whim, or freezing certain coins with blacklists, would completely defeat the purpose of having Bitcoin.
I'm also aware 80+% of all BTC never moves from cold storage. It's your savings that matter, not your ability to send a nickel for a penny.
I'm also aware people want their nickels sent for pennies to confirm instantly. Those people have what are called "First World Problems".


MultiBit charges 1000 Satoshis per transaction. And surely having a popular open source wallet or library framework used by millions of people is valuable?

You can't force any even *remotely* controversial changes into the Bitcoin protocol when the people at large have adopted full nodes, which decide what is a valid BTC transaction.


Sounds like a problem with marketable tech solutions. Why bet against financially incentivized technical innovation?


Soft fork limits are not network policy, but are default `bitcoind` configuration settings that can be changed at a whim. Miner's can trivially override the "soft fork" settings, and they would, if it were profitable. Configuration settings are a very messy way to run a distributed consensus system. At best it gives only an illusion of "consensus".
