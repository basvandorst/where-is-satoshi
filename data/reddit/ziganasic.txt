Dude you can follow the transaction of funds. Learn some
facts( even if you send it to exchange, you can see if those were sold) . They WITHELD the funds on the account and notify me about soing this via email, then the procesure run for 30
days and after the other party hasnt done what was required and i should have received funds back, they informed me that something they WITHELD does not exist from
the beginning... How do you think that is possible?

Hi [nasicmari  
Thank you for contacting us regarding your dispute regarding funds stored on Bittrex. We understand that you claim ownership of funds held in the account of another user on Bittrex.  
Txid for the reported transaction:  
[   
Bittrex does not resolve disputes regarding ownership of funds. Instead, Bittrex offers to put the parties to the dispute in contact with one another so that they can resolve the dispute themselves, and communicate to Bittrex how to proceed. Bittrex will release funds only in the following circumstances: (1) the parties jointly communicate settlement agreement that is jointly signed and notarized by all interested parties, (2) receipt of a valid and final court order or order from law enforcement demanding release of the funds, (3) if you fail to respond to this notice within 30 days, or (4) if the funds remain unclaimed or the dispute remains unresolved for a time longer than the limit imposed by state escheat laws, whereupon funds will be transferred to the state associated with your account.   
We are prepared to share your contact information with owner of the account where you claim ownership of funds, but are seeking your consent to do so. These funds will remain suspended until the dispute is resolved. If you would rather that we share alternative contact information (i.e., your lawyer or a generic contact email), please provide it instead.   
**If you refuse to consent to sharing contact information with the account owner, or if we do not receive a response to this notice within 30 days from the date of this email, we will release the disputed funds to the account owner.**  
Please reply to this email and provide the name, email address, phone number, and physical address that you would like us to share with the account owner. We trust that you will work to resolve this matter in one of the ways described above, whereupon we will release the funds.  
Please contact us with any questions.  
Best Regards,
Joseph @ Bittrex

Hi [nasicmari  
Please accept my apologies for the delayed response.   
I can confirm that I have not received any additional contact information from the other party to this dispute. Should the other party resume communication and provide valid contact information in the future, we can re-initiate this process.   
With regard to the funds in question, they were no longer held on the other party's account at the time you initially reported them as stolen, so they cannot be recovered at this time.  
Best Regards,
Joseph @ Bittrex
