How would you get away with licensing?
@_date: 2015-06-06 19:57:08
I thought they were creating their own blockchain no?
@_date: 2015-06-19 20:26:30
I think we'll see a drop back to 220-230 range. I believe that when the fork for the 8bm blocks happens, a minor panic pre-sell will occur. This of course will apply mostly to the less tech savvy folk imo that hear all the FUD.

Thanks geymos
@_date: 2015-06-22 14:30:15
I used it before, the greedy bastard still charge you a fee when you pay with bitcoin. They are either oblivious to how bitcoin works or just plain greedy. I wouldn't recommend using btc for their service as they actually make more money off you. Might as well pay with a cc or paypal.
@_date: 2014-10-12 19:28:12
Its on must be right.

Marc Andreessen interview at [Stanford](
Mentions Bitcoin later in the interview, though the entire interview is definitely worth a watch. So is the [PandoMonthly](

-_- Virustotal.com is differenn than TOTALvirus.com that is the website I scanned and accidetally visited. and its showing me malware detected on it.
I downloaded the microsoft malware detector after I visited the wrong website and not worried.

Do I have to do this on windows 7? I also have a Mac that I use for exchanges and going on coinbase but I do not hold any wallets on the Mac, should I be worried?
@_date: 2014-09-29 23:14:37
your account is brand new, so technically you were never here.
@_date: 2016-03-16 00:03:33
Some one ELI5 please - can you be affected just by visiting the sites and not clicking any ads?
@_date: 2016-01-15 19:54:49
Don't do it! Telling you its a scam!
Edit: Being down voted by these trolls/scammers. You've been warned!!!!
@_date: 2016-01-06 13:12:31
Not for 2016
@_date: 2016-03-29 00:30:35
They just cant do auto recurring payments, so they just say broken.
@_date: 2016-01-15 19:51:25

@_date: 2016-01-21 17:27:57
Once again, being down voted by these shills/scum. DO NOT WASTE YOUR BITS!!!! These noobs always crawl out of their sewers when there's volitility in bitcoin.
BE CAUTIOUS FRIENDS!!!
@_date: 2016-06-30 19:35:31
Well, I agree with you and I do think bitcoin will be adopted quicker than the internet due to the information highway already here. But we're talking total disruption here :)!
@_date: 2016-01-21 17:12:58
Scam alaert, you been warned!!!!!!!
@_date: 2016-06-30 18:18:55
"next three years"
As a bitoin believer, I too, believe not much disruption will happen over a course of 3 years. Now, 10-15 years is different story...

Whoever setup this atm has no idea on how to monetize it.

The terminology slide(25) needs editing, Bitcoin is the infrastructure and lower case bitcoin is the currency.
@_date: 2015-07-07 18:25:22
Satoshi accepts your challenge!
@_date: 2015-07-27 22:17:13

Smooth, I'm liking it a lot!
Is there any release date for openbazaar yet? I thought I remembered seeing that the release would happen in December or am I wrong?
@_date: 2016-02-08 03:28:35
I've used them before and believe it or not, turned 30$ into 170$ playing blackjack. I was worried that the withdrawal wouldn't go through but everything went smoothly. You should try contacting them.
@_date: 2015-07-27 18:01:34
What can we do about this?
Edit: could someone ELI5? How are they able to hack our phones with a text?
@_date: 2016-09-08 01:23:35
I was thinking the same, not touching it.
@_date: 2018-03-18 04:44:15
For the better! Maybe somebody could put it to good use!

@_date: 2015-04-27 21:59:12
Could somebody please explain how they are able to get that kind of discount?
@_date: 2015-09-15 14:44:19
Could someone elaborate how it's an investment?
@_date: 2015-11-05 03:51:36
Price dropped on the second auction. Theory then was "Price manipulation for cheaper bulk coins"
Yes it happened.

Sad part is, people will actually think that was Satoshi.
@_date: 2015-11-05 22:43:51
yeah, he use to promote it as Daves wallet recovery services but changed it I guess.
