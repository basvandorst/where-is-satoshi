That one hub would need to have enough Bitcoin to match every single person who opened a channel with them's input into that channel - in other words, they'd need to have as much Bitcoin as every other user of the network combined.

People don't like not knowing what stuff is and learning about stuff is harder than not liking stuff.

If a company wants to pay it's workers a shitty wage and give them no benefits, that's their right.
Just because it's their right doesn't mean workers shouldn't strike.

The entire point of the network is that the channel you open is not "controlled by a third party". It's a multisig address where the two parties each have one of the keys. You could argue the network is technically a third party I guess - but it's a trustless third party so it doesn't really matter.
Increasing the block size may help in the short term, but it would mega fuck us in the long term. Lightning is the only solution I've seen to scaling that gets more effective as more people use it instead of falling apart.

I have a question about segwit. If a large majority of transactions were segwit transactions, blocks would end up being around 2MB for non-legacy nodes, right? A lot of the arguments I've seen against block size increases talk about how larger blocks make it harder for individuals to run a node.
Is there something about segwit that makes this size increases different, or are the node running difficulty concerns more about if increasing the block size becomes a habit and we get 8 or 16MB blocks?

Are there any concerns about anonymity in the Lightning Network if we end up connected to a few large hubs? I know onion routing is supposed to prevent intermediate nodes from knowing too much about the transaction, but from what I understand it doesn't really work if there's only one hop.
For instance, if LNHub Inc is my connection to Amazon and I send a payment through them that routes to their channel that connects to Amazon, wouldn't they be able to determine some aspects of what I'm doing since they'll be able to assume that the transaction's next stop is probably the endpoint?
Not trying to badmouth lightning or anything - I'm super excited for it. Just want to see if this is something that's been talked about and more generally what your Lightning neighbors will know about you.

Two things from what I understand
1) Most news stories that influence the price of crypto tend to be general and not only forecasting positive / negative effects for a single cryptocurrency.
2) One of them going down could be seen as a sign that the rest will go down because they are perceived to be closely tied. Basically, it's a self-fulfilling prophecy.

It's hard to say. The blockchain is one of those things that feels like it should be really useful even if we haven't figured something out yet. I feel like it's probably overrated now, but that's mostly just because it's currently valued at an absurd rate. I'm not high on today's altcoins that claim to have special utility, but I wouldn't be surprised if some novel use for it comes up some time in the future.
This is all still pretty new technology. If Bitcoin were TCP/IP and the genesis block was the equivalent of when IBM adopted that standard, we'd only be in 1993 right now.

I don't really care whether a technology is centralized around hubs. The important part is that it's trustless. The worst a hub could do is inconvenience it's users.

The most important part of lightning isn't that it's cheaper now - it's that it's the only proposed scaling option I've seen that gets more effective as adoption increases as opposed to falling apart.

Brainstorm would be a great name for a Lightning wallet

One of two things. If it has the utility to support the price, it will never be "too expensive" because as its price increases, the value of the things you can buy with it also increase.
If it doesn't and it's overvalued, that's pretty much the definition of a bubble and it'll pop.
@_date: 2018-01-22 12:45:48
To me, the most important thing to remember is that while large nodes may lead to centralization of a sort, it's still a trustless system no matter how large they get. They could inconvenience the network if they go down, but they can't take control of your funds.

From what I've seen, they're like the anti vaxxers of crypto.

I'm very curious what you think the Lighting Network is.

So in this use case we probably won't see much immediate change in fees when it's turned on - it won't be until infrastructure to support it is created?

"We store billions of dollars worth of bitcoin on behalf of customers and any change to our infrastructure is done with significant planning and consideration for the security and stability of our platform."
Hard to argue when they put it like that.

I'm still confused by how channels will work for use cases like this. Would I usually have to open a channel every time I want to buy a coffee or is it expected that channels will persist until the money held in them is needed elsewhere in which case after my first time at the coffee shop I'm likely to have a channel already open / one of my other persistent channels will have a path there?
