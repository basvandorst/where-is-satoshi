Bitstamp does that too.... depending on your credit card there may be a +5% fee (maybe on both ends) and daily interest charge

you need to take the pool of people that you trust 100% and put this in the hands of the smartest one.
because there are so many tricks
a ledger nano can have hidden accounts
there can be 20+ different kinds of coins but the nano only holds 4 or so apps at a time... so you need to use their software to swap on each app and look
and then there are fork coins.... you might have fork coin of a kind that nano has not yet programmed an app for....
coinbase might be easy but they might also charge a higher fee if you don't use the right tricks... use their sister site GDAX to pay no fees (but harder to use)
computer security, sending wrong kind of coin to wrong kind of address, segwit vs legacy fees, meltdown/spectre bugs, 2FA
do not enter the secret codes on the paper into an email or word document on a computer for safe keeping. Dont take a photo of them with your phone for convenience.
etc etc etc

I use it to get tips. And it has worked 4 or 6 times.
addresses are not single transaction

if the payment never went thru then u have the btc in your wallet
if the payment went thru then the the btc is in the receiver's wallet
if the receiver has it and you say please refund, they will send you $50 of btc I bet

I put a QR code on my banner on my youtube channel and mention my tip jar in my video descriptions. Then once in a while someone surprises me with a tip!
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:50:48
you are safe... I put my QR image right on my youtube banner to encourage tips
@_date: 2017-08-25 19:04:55
nice explanation
@_date: 2017-08-26 03:17:19
yes very convenient, only 11 keystrokes and no mental gymnastics
@_date: 2017-08-24 18:28:41
that reminds me... the btc tip was before the fork so I got bcc too!
@_date: 2017-08-26 21:14:45
more memes plz
@_date: 2017-08-26 22:17:09
...while you find another btc noob and accuse them of conspiracy for using the p-word. Almost makes me wonder if you have some ulterior motive... 
@_date: 2017-08-27 19:16:52
you don't pay until you realize a profit (convert to $) - right?
@_date: 2017-08-24 15:48:02
not as many as I think I should get!
I get between 1000 and 15000 views these days. (If someone steals and reposts on facebook I get millions of views)
@_date: 2017-08-24 20:22:10
does it? that would be awesome
I mean can someone with BCC scan my BTC QRcode and send a tip?
@_date: 2017-08-26 17:49:03
I really don't know enough to be guilty of the conspiracy you are imagining.
@_date: 2017-08-24 14:55:06
Thanks for taking an interest.    
My channel is about the "thug life" meme - funny videos with rap music added.     
I have a ton of humorous political videos too.     
 Offensive Political Content - not for sensitive viewers    
@_date: 2017-08-26 22:19:00
quick, I need 496k new subs

the problem being "why should I pay via bitcoin when I can pay some other method and not have to pay a fee?" plus "why should I pay a high fee for a fast transaction when I can pay some other fast method and not have to pay any fee at all?"
@_date: 2017-08-25 23:50:46
my other idea is I want my bitcoin ira to be worth zillions
@_date: 2017-08-26 18:05:56
ok, sorry I didn't use you preferred words in the title
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:47:20
This is an awesome thing you are doing, and I hope you find 25 worthy charities (watch out for the ones that pocket 99% and give 1%).
God Bless
If you have any trouble finding 25 worthy charities, and you are a fan of Trump, and a fan of shitty videos, you can consider yours truly as a possible unworthy recipient. I make zero money from youtube and only get about $3/month from patreon donors. 
@_date: 2017-08-24 18:14:26
I could convert it before the value drops to 0
@_date: 2017-08-24 18:13:41
oh wow, good idea
@_date: 2017-09-07 20:18:57
what did they do (scam promotion)?
@_date: 2017-10-03 15:00:12
bit coin tips have been better than patreon for my youtube channel
@_date: 2017-10-11 22:06:11
its definitely about getting free money for 99.99% of people
@_date: 2017-10-11 19:03:21
I put in my junk email too, not sure how legit the contest is but worth a shot
@_date: 2017-10-11 16:58:57
because people don't like having their coin stolen
@_date: 2017-10-06 20:12:25
Thanks for watching, hope you enjoyed it
