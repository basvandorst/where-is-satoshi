OK, calm down Disney

Yeah, quite a bit of those threads. If you spend all of the compute cycles to get the vanity address I guess you might as well spam with it!
I am not worried as I won't consolidate any of the receiving wallets, even if the transactions do confirm.

0 Transactions just in case anyone is wondering :)

Anyone care to comment on how difficult it is to generate a 5 letter vanity address? (Starts with 5 predetermined characters, case-sensitive)
I assume this kind of spam will go away when miners stop handling 0 fee transactions. Interesting that they did not even drop a comment on the transaction.

Double check your account statement. My credit card company just did the same with my card but still allowed charges on the old card for 60-days so I would have time to receive my new one and update vendors. Both card numbers draw on the same account.

I think what he is saying is that they can be spent with 2-of-2 before 90-days and 1-of-2 after 90 days. (or whatever block timeline you choose) Maybe for holding in escrow or like GreenAddress a marker address can make a transaction immediate by putting the responsibility for ensuring the transaction, if it doesn't occur then GreenAddress can return the funds.

Hey upvote for a guy that knows what is going on. This is currently very attractive to merchants that want to take Bitcoin payments but do not want to worry about the volatility in value. Many are finding (with the current up trend though) that speculating is earning them additional profit.
