Bitcoin can live on without the US and EU... it will take a hit value wise but then bounce back. They can’t impose their rules on the test of the world. Do you really think the rest of the world will give a fuck?? “Ok masters we’ll stop using it because you find it not beneficial” Fuck off!! With the shit hitting the fan in Iran, HK, Argentina, Venezuela, or weather its implementations happening in Japan, S. Korea, Australia, and large emerging markets like India and Africa, crypto is about people using it. It can survive with just China and India. What the US and EU are battling with is that the crypto train has left the station and is picking up speed. If they don’t jump off now they won’t be able to later.
