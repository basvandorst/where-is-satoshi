Regret spending $1000 to preorder a BFL in March 2013 rather than buying $1000 worth of BTC (then ~$30 each)...

You literally can't create Turing-complete smart contracts on Bitcoin. You can't issue tokenized assets. You can't do completely private transactions. BTC can't do it all. If you think a single blockchain is going to satisfy all the needs of all the world's population, and all the thousands (of current dapps) and millions of dapps yet to be released... you're kidding yourself. BTC will do fine. So will many other currencies (crypto and non-crypto alike).

It's not about address creation. It's about the core features of the blockchain itself. The op codes and account abstraction that Ethereum has does not exist on UTXO. BTC is too simple (a strength in one sense, a weakness in others)
The only way to achieve ETH-like programming on Bitcoin would be to 1) fork it and then 2) change the core code so much that you might as well launch your own chain...because you're not on the core chain, you're vulnerable to 51% attacks, you don't have alternative consensus mechanisms, etc. 
And so, thanks to the simple &amp; secure vs. complex &amp; capable, we'll always have multiple chains that are successful, have niches that BTC can't fill, etc. 
People need to understand there's tradeoffs. BTC has made wise trade-offs but alt chains need to make different trade-offs to thrive. And ETH is good example

I think they will... Eventually. I mean right now, it's early days. But the tech will evolve. People will compete and iterate and eventually every existing banking service you can think of will be encoded into a block chain smart contract or set of contracts. I look to the long view. I think what it can do now is amazing but imagine what that looks like once it matures and people build more secure and user friendly interfaces for it.

This is by no means comprehensive but does cover some of the dapps out there: 
Etheremon and CryptoKitties are popular games...but there's other app types out there like Augur, Bancor, 0x, MakerDAO, OmiseGo, Basic Attention Token (Brave browser), Minds social network, etc.
@_date: 2018-08-14 05:25:38
Ethereum has some of the most interesting use cases. Decentralized lending (DAI), decentralized exchanges (0x), tokenized assets, prediction markets (Augur), games like Etheremon,  etc. There's a lot there. And I don't think Ethereum and Bitcoin are trying to be the same things. BTC for store of value and payments... ETH for dapps and decentralized platforms.
@_date: 2018-08-14 05:41:46
You can't build a decentralized loan-issuing smart contract on an app. You need a blockchain for that. You can't build a predictions market on there...these are things you can't build any other way. 
@_date: 2018-08-14 05:12:29
I agree that BTC has a better protective "moat" than any other crypto...buuuut...I don't agree that Bitcoin is the end all be all of blockchain tech. There's lots of interesting use cases that are not even currently possible on Bitcoins blockchain. And that's ok. Bitcoin has made specific security-minded trade offs. However, there are classes of applications that need Turing completeness or alternative consensus to be feasible.

Why does everyone say that? Vitalik and other Ethereum co-founders are walking around in broad daylight, giving speeches, and they're fine.

That sort of thing takes care of itself when you have a market economy that runs autonomously. No one was willing to invest in basic industries in Venezuela, because you didn't know if the government was going to swoop in and take it from you. Way too risky.
@_date: 2019-03-14 01:55:38
What part did the US play in destabilizing Venezuela? The only way we played a part is by giving richer Venezuelans a place to flee to.

The CIA didn't need to do a damn thing to wreck Venezuela's economy. That was Chavez and his corrupt, socialist policies. Plain and simple. 
They got a nice ride for a while on high oil prices throughout the early 00's. Meanwhile they nationalized industries (from agriculture to oil to finance to tourism), confiscated property, left crime unchecked to the point that Venezuela became one of the murder capitals of the world, spooked foreign investment entirely out of the country, cozied up with Cuba, debased their currency to the brink, violated human rights, and jailed and intimidated political opponents. 
Venezuela has some of the world's largest oil reserves and they're out of fucking electricity. Venezuela has some of the world's largest freshwater supplies and they're out of fucking water. Fuck socialism.

I went to Venezuela in 2011. Plastered all over the country were billboards that said "Hecho en Socialismo".   
That country allowed tenants to seize control of property that was rightfully owned by others. It subsidized gas at ridiculously low rates (10 cents a gallon or less in most places). Gave free electricity to win votes. Chavez preached the gospel of socialism every chance it could.
The problem with Communism / State Capitalism / Socialism whatever you want to call it, is that besides violating basic human rights (including the right to property), nobody can compete with the government on anything. And nobody is left with enough power to win over the government once things go bad (they always do). So they always slide into dictatorships or oligarchies.

No it didn't. It decreased dramatically many years along the way and then bounced back up to new record highs.

I had to pay by the hour (or at least my parents did) to access AOL back in the day, as a 10 year old. I tried using it as a kid every day until my parents got hit with a $300 bill.
At any rate, Bitcoin does have to compete with entrenched financial services built up around USD. Not only is it non-trivial to disrupt a financial system, it's going to take several decades to do because this is real money we're talking about here and people are going to be cautious to move everything over to crypto. I believe it will happen. I believe the BTC blockchain will probably outlive the Federal Reserve...but I don't believe it'll happen overnight.

Except BTC isn't a stock and in a good way. BTC can't go bankrupt.  BTC will carry on as long as there's people willing to run CPU cycles to keep the network going...which is pretty much forever.

Tether's market cap is like $2B. It can't have created $800B of demand. And really, Tether is just a cheap way of converting to "cash equivalent" holding. It's easier for the exchanges to offer a BTC/USDT base pair than to offer a BTC/USD base pair...because once you're trading BTC for USD, it's a slower and more expensive process, and the exchange itself has to keep and manage cash on hand to settle funds. USDT was a convenience, not a demand-generation tool. Fact is that in crypto, only a small % of supply is ever on the market. And in the run-up last year, buyers were hopping into the crypto markets while holders were withdrawing their supply from the market. The ICO craze led to the bubble, with people buying many brand-new coins that had very little chance of succeeding. All we're doing now is riding out the hype cycle curve, where inflated expectations have met the reality of what's actually achievable with crypto tech.

BTC still has usage. It's internationally traded at this point. Maybe you would have had an argument in 2010 but at this point it's too liquid and too known to go to zero. I have no idea how far the price will go down or up but I can guarantee you it won't go to zero. The only thing that would cause that is a systemic and irreparable, unforkable failure in the protocol. Which is way less than 1% likely to happen.

Sure, there's pros and cons. The USD is a solid currency, it's the king of currencies and has been for quite some time. But it wasn't always so. The U.S. originally issued "Continentals" which became a failed currency. The Confederate government also issued its own currency which became worthless (except for modern collector value). It took hundreds of years for the U.S. dollar to arrive at its current dominant, relatively stable position. Even throughout most of the 20th century, its value was eroded sometimes quite rapidly (as recently as the 70s, inflation reached double digits for several years). 
Do we know if USD will maintain its low-inflation forever? Do we know if it will be dominant forever? Nope.

This guy likes Facebook and Google owning their digital identity and dishing it out to the highest bidder. Don't expect free speech on the internet if only a handful of tech companies control the flow of money. This is literally one of the original and best damn use cases for Bitcoin so really struggling to follow anyone's logic who supports crypto but happens to disagree with Rubin or Peterson.

We are still at the point of inevitability. BTC already has many superior qualities to cash or other currencies. With or without mass adoption, it certainly has some adoption. People aren't going to stop wanting to move money around on the internet, are they? BTC certainly solves for this problem, in a very elegant way. And it does so without regulatory bodies maintaining its credibility. That's impressive. At any rate...BTC has been around almost 10 years and it will still be here in 10 years.

Bear/bull dynamics apply to markets of all kinds. Stocks, bonds, currencies, industries within the stock market, etc. There's also no doubting that crypto is a new asset class. It has rarity, demand, liquidity, fungibility, etc.

Loans aren't income. But as others pointed out if you have to liquidate crypto to pay your loan off, that's a taxable event. Also, I am not an accountant. So take that for what it's worth.

Dollar cost averaging, great long term strategy. I set up Coinbase to auto-debit $250 a month (can't quite afford $1K) and have been doing so since late 2016. I don't worry about the swings and I'll look at it in 5 years.
TBH, one thought I had not too long ago, was that for crypto to hit new all-time highs again...it will have to hit mass adoption and once it gets there, you won't want to sell anyways, because at that point it will be an established asset class with increasing utility. It would be like Jeff Bezos selling all his Amazon stock once he became a billionaire.
