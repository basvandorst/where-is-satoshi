To keep perspective Id like to that just 2 years ago, many of us would have seen this as a great move in the right direction, even if it was the smallest bank in Argentina.
With the massive problems the Argentine Peso has been facing especially in the last few months, (tragic as it is, I mean that) this will provide a lot of data on how Bitcoin adapts to the most recent economic crisis.
Let me be clear that I dont wish poverty on anyone. We learned a lot from past economic crisis like the ongoing Venezuela hyper inflation.
Argentinas govt and banks are likely to take a  more open stance to Bitcoin, for several reasons. A big reason being in the last year gloabal awareness and education about Bitcoin has surged, (obviously still has a long  way to go, but public perception of Bitcoin has gotten far more positive.)
Maybe innovators and entrepreneurs will find a way to use Bitcoin in this crisis in new ways or just use Bitcoin more than previous economic crisis of similar scale.
Desperation is the mother of change and innovation.

It shows a lack of transparency and a pattern of intentional misdirection from BCH leadershio to keep this and other examples going for so long. 
Nobody appreciates being misled especially when its about wealth.
Investors and regulators do look for integrity.
The tragedy is these arent difficult things to change, people and regulators are much more educated today than even 90 days ago and they are catching on. 
We need accountability, and investors have a right to accurate investment information and the odds of serious consequences for intentionally misleading investors grows as the space matures. 
Regulatory groups like the SEC look for fiduciary duty, transparency, self regulation efforts and trustworthiness especially with so money involved....
Its important investors and regulators know this is not at all an isolated incident and is an ongoing pattern with clear intent. Any sincere investigation or review will easily verify this is an ongoing pattern that continues to cause society harm. 
Furthermore the reasons Ver went to prison, are earily similar to his actions regarding Bitcoin and Bitcoin cash. Ver was convicted and went to prison for intentionally mislabeling a product and sold this mislabeled product on the internet. Ironically, in essence this is the same thing Ver is doing today, by mislabeling and misleading BCH as BTC....Except in this case its on a much much larger scale, involving more people, more money and more harm. 
This subreddit example is just one of many and part of a larger ongoing pattern to mislead people at various of the community.

For us Android users Eclair is the ons to watch.
And its gotten a lot more user-friendly.
Mind you until recently I was focusing my attention on lightning labs, not realizing its Eclair that will likely be used most often for small transactions from our phones.
Removing the smaller transactions from the blockchain from mobile wallets is amazing. Then as it gets tested more and more increase the size.
All just opinion.... But man LN is amazing.
I think LN growth will add more pressure for wallets to add segwit or get left behind.

 I really appreciate anyone who puts together metrics like this for us.
I'd love to see  the correlations between price \(or time\) and \(various components of the Bitcoin ecosystem\) New capital being invested into mining is an obvious one and can be examined in all kinds of ways.  The R&amp;D spending by new ASIC producers, how much Samsung is spending on developing even faster versions of the  Halong miner. 10 NM chips are state of the art and were not cheap to develop and Samsung does not invest  into something to lose money. How much is Intels R&amp;D spending? Nvidia? 
Or another metric that would be invaluable is new employment created in the ecosystem, including all the secondary and tertiary jobs.....
New peer reviewed research articles, correlated to price or time.
I know getting that data would be really difficult right now but I'd bet that they are all increasing exponentially as a correlation to both time and price.

To use Segwit you just need to pick a wallet that supports it.... By using Segwit, you save fees and help everyone save fees and make a faster network for everyone.
And Id say it supports stronger network for everyone as Segwit fixes transaction maleability and makes goodies like Lightning Network much easier.

Recently bought some using Samurai wallet from a seller in person using a ledger nano. Both are segwit ready, BUT the reciever using Samurai wallet had to uncheck the box for BECH32.
It wouldnt work with the BECH32 box checked on Samurai.
We assumed that Ledger nano isnt BECH32 ready yet... But the transaction was still a segwit transaction...
I still am in awe that Bitcoiners won segwit after 2 years.... Gratitude to the UASF.
@_date: 2018-05-21 22:07:56
Made the switch from Mycelium to Samurai and I'm very very happy.
Samurai is simple and clean, but if you want to do more you can, and even what Ive tried is set up easily.
Segwit transactions and a checkbox to add BECH32.
All kinds of security extras.....but none of that needs to be used, you can use it nice and easy and just get Segwit transactions.
I cant believe mycelium isnt segwit, I waited for them to switch because I was used to mycelium. It took me minutes to realize samurai is as easy to use.

This is the Exchange Montreal and they buy and sell Bitcoin in person. Just scan your QR code and done.
They are excellent and its nice to have a face to face encounter, and their fees are cheaper than the ATMS which are all over Montreal now. 
All those screens are price charts or data about the mempool and just general info.
They use Segwit but my BECH 32 address didnt work with them last time I tried....I bet they get BECH 32 ready soon.
This place and the Bitcoin Embassy sort of changed my life, even just the people I meet there helped me learn so much. Im not rich or anything, but I think if it wasnt for the Bitcoin Embassy where you can walk in and ask questions comfortably I wouldnt have gotten my first Satoshi.
They opened right around the same time that the Bitcoin Embassy closed in Montreal, so I suspect its similar management or something. I recognize one staff member from the Bitcoin Embassy. 
Its set up really well. Here is the link, which is useful because you can see what the going rate is to buy or sell.

Yes price and time are a regular price chart.
To be more clear, corrleating transactions or hash power to price is one metric, but substitute price for time and running the data would be positive non linear curves too. 
With time on the Y axis it would be really interesting to see the results after putting pretty much anything we can measure in the Bitcoin ecosystem on the X axis.... 
I just wasnt clear in my post. 
I actually made a video about this topic maybe month ago... Heres a link

On your phone Samurai wallet for Android and Bread for Iphone. There are other good ones but those are good. Hard to say which is the best. 
Then at home or  wherever you keep your Bitcoin use a hardware wallet like Trezor or Ledger....
IMO Just use the wallet on your phone for small stuff, like using a Bitcoin ATM and then put it on your personal safe, which is your hardware wallet. 
Leave your main stash on the hardware wallet, hardware wallets are probably the best investments you can make. They never expose your keys to the internet, and are very usrr friendly. They are now made with the newcomer in mind. 
Just 18 months ago lots of people were  walking around with all thier BTC on thier phone... Times have changed.

I’ll be accumulating as long as the prices stay here or go down. Many people I know who did really well accumulated Bitcoin all the way down and sideways in 2016 and the first half of 2017.....Now those same people are starting to accumulate again, slowly.
So if the price goes above $20k next week, great. But the longer we get to accumulate the better. Personally Id love a chance to keep nibbling until then fall or even longer.
There are metrics to watch....lightning adoption, Segwit adoption, and things like ETFs and how financial crisis in nations implement Bitcon. New companies investing millions in state of the are ASICs is big. Samsung doesnt spend 30 million researching cutting edge Halong miners to lose money for share holders. The list goes on.
Accumulate $200 here and there, and if it drops further keep buying it all the way down....IMO by the halving your life will be financially improved in a meaningful life changing way,

This latest Segwit &amp; increase is really nice to see. Its happening fast now.
The &amp; of segwit transactions has never really gone down, since it began last August. That means theres never been a major wallet or exchange that started using it and had to stop using it....At this point the data speaks for itself, Segwit is here to stay.
IMO if we had agreed to Segwit 2X, I suspect the urgency to implement Segwit would not have had nearly the  same impetus to get done. \(since the mempool would be fine\) But it would have  continued to delay lightning network. In a sense the big blockers, did slow Lightning down by delaying a fix for transaction malleability....
In the end  Bitcoin came out stronger than ever.
@_date: 2019-03-11 19:16:51
Some people here seem to be getting confused by the 2 versions of Segwit....they are both drastically better than no Segwit at all, but Bech 32 is the most advanced form of Segwit currently available. You can tell it’s Bech32 if the address begins with bc1....older Segwit addresses will start with the number 3.
Both types are Segwit, Bech32 is newer and better but not all wallets have upgraded to it yet.
If your address that starts with the number 1 then it’s not Segwit at all....it’s still the old legacy address.
The BC1 or just 1 will be noticeable when receiving or sending Bitcoin at the very start of the address. If both the sender and receiver aren’t using a Segwit wallet yet, it will be sent as an old legacy address.
There are some other details but that is the basic way to tell,  BC1 = best, but still not common, 3 = Segwit but the older P2SH version, 1 = the old legacy format with no Segwit.

Descending triangle for 6 months to one persons eyes.
Another person sees 4 months of price stability. Never going below the Feb 6th low.
The bull run isn't around the corner, but the argument that this is an accumulation stage is getting stronger with each week of price stability.... Next thing you know and this was something akin to our 2016 buying opportunity.

This reminded me how the 2014 price spike made charts in late 2016 make a giant “U” shape from $1k and back to $1k....it looked like a giant smile or “U” shape when we looked at the chart.
That probably happened before with lower price spikes, like $10 and back to $10.
I look forward to when the Bitcoin price chart starts to resemble a giant $20k smile...
@_date: 2018-06-13 19:44:51
This is basically exactly how I feel. Heck I hope the price increases sooner, but at the same time the longer I get to accumulate the better.
This could become an opportunity like 2016 all over again... And if it trends lower, I'll happily buy chunks all the way down... Then keep buying as it reverses and if it trends up gently like 2016 then I'll make larger buys (with whatever I can manage to save, luckily Bitcoin makea saving enjoyable.

If you are thinking thoughts like... 
"It was easy for him to hold, he was rich"
"must be nice not needing to sell when your rich" 
Those are dangerous ways of thinking, and can keep you bound to a life of poverty. Nobody said it would be easy. Many Bitcoiners have held through this before, and know how your mind will rationalize and justify selling low. 
It's not easy, and it's just as difficult to be up over 100%,and not sell because Bitcoin has always gone way way above previous all time highs.

I'm happy to see each of the 3 lows since Feb has been a higher low than the previous low.
If this occured over 2 weeks or 1 month it would be less relevant to me... But this is now a 4 month trend of increasingly higher lows. That is a bullish indicator, and the longer we keep that trend the better, as long as the next low is higher than the previous... It feels more and more like an accumulation phase. 
 
On the bearish side o(to be fair) the highs have been getting lower to over the last 4 months....
To me, sure I'd be happy if it went up fast, but I'm also very happy to accumulate for awhile. 
Im looking at Bitcoin like a type of savings account.

Im pretty happy to Lear  there's a mainnet Eclair wallet.
And for The Anton K LN wallet I just got it last night and its easy to use.
I love that both Eclair and Anton K LN are easy to use, and we don't need to set up a node or anything like that.
Also nice to see is the wallets are being updated often. Making them better and better.
I honestly thought I'd  send my first lightning transaction later this year, by fall. But I sent money to my LN wallet last night on mainnet and it happened on a mobile phone....not even on a desktop...It made my day to learn Eclair had a mainnet wallet too, as I really like that wallet on the testnet version. 
Anyway thanks for the reply. 
I still am euphoric, that I am now using LN and on my phone at that.

It would be something that is intentionally not discussed (yet) but is there any examples or plans of using Bitcoin to help avoid the trade tarrifs?
Even if it were just discussed as an option to facilitate the continuation of existing trade between EU, Canadian or Chinese companies and US companies.
Emphasizing that Bitcoin use to facilitate trade and jobs in both countries where tarrifs are put in place...including the US, showing how Bitcoin kept US jobs going would IMO be helpful. 
Its a matter of time until nations with trade sanctions begin using Bitcoin in a thoughtful, private enough way to sell some oil. Has this happened already? I bet it's hard to prove
but I'm OK with Russia keeping some emergency reserve bitcoin on hand. Same with  countries that don't have sanctions on them now but might have sanctions in a few months  from now, Iran had this happen. 
Maybe stocking up on some BTC is a viable backup option now. 
Myself as a Canadian, I can say people here aren't upset with American people at all. But it's the leadership throwing sanctions on us after being ultra close allies, and to be called a threat to our neighbors security after sending troops to Afghanistan and supporting essentially everything the white house asked, people are talking about it all over. 
Nobody knows who is next in line, for tarrifs or sanctions. So wouldn't it be prudent to have some BTC? 
I feel this trade war is getting people thinking of backup plans... 
Sorry for talking politics. I have family in the US, and great US friends who spend summers in Montreal. The question  is, isnt this exactly one of the reasons Bitcoin exists? Monetary sovereignty

More and more new ASIC manufacturers get up and selling, and they are large companies all the world (for exaple Samsung has sharebolders to answer to, they didn't develop and build the Halong to lower EPS. )
Its almost certain Bitmain is holding massive amounts of BCH to keep the price up, a few months it made more sense in game theory do Bitmain to do this. But as times change, we may see Bitmain abondon hedging with BCH and sell into BTC..... At that point hash power will come with it, and when it's clear Bitmain is letting BCH go.... Then maybe the 51% attack, but I think it would not be a good move to attack BCH after they have begun to fall.
That is all wild speculation by the way:) 
Have a great day!

OK hypothetically, 
Would today's Bitcoin (with 39% segwit txns, exchanges using batching and some BECH32 and LN and other changes to the ecosystem)
How would Bitcoin hold up if we saw volume like we did in mid December? 
I recall reading that just by the exchanges implementing batching, we could have avoided those very high fees and mem pool congestion. 
The big exchanges have added batching and segwit now, and Bitcoin has improved a lot in other ways too. 
Has Bitcoin evolved enough to handle something like December 2017 again? 
Thoughts?

Ya I'm so impressed with Samurai wallet. With Samurai you are the person who can do Bech 32, and  other good segwit ready wallets like Ledger Nano for example cant scan your QR code...Then I get to say "oh your wallet doesn't support Bech 32 yet?"(then smile as I uncheck the Bech 32 box)
At that point they can scan my QR code and send me the BTC.... Its still going through as a segwit transaction but not a BECH32 segwit transaction. But I'm sure other wallets will upgrade soon.
Trezor has already I believe... Maybe Ledger Nano has Bech 32 support but the Bitcoin vendor I go to hasn't upgraded firmware yet or something.
Samurai let's us do all kinds of interesting things, like a lot. They released an update recently. I never had a problem but I've never used thier TOR feature or anything like that yet
@_date: 2018-06-02 06:10:09
Its worth repeating, the benefits of putting Eclair on your Android are really useful. In just 2 weeks, I have a better idea of where LN is and get to see updates as they are released and watch the wallet get better and better.
Im not a developer and in 2 weeks just playing with Eclair for a bit has moved me along the learning curve in a major way.
I really recommend having the wallet to check out, and suddenly its easier to visualize how the LN works and how incredible it can get. I look forward to the next update,,,,I love when LN wallets get updates. I agree LN and Bitcoin are never done, and will keep improving. 
Really try using the wallet, even without BTC on it. Just see how it works. And you can watch LN grow and improve and become more user friendly.....Its happening faster than anyone really knows.
@_date: 2018-06-14 23:23:42
Yes, it's impressive to notice how much has changed in just 6 months. Heck we even have  mainnet LN wallet on our phones now. 
IMHO the mem pool congestion and  resulting fees if December 2017 are sign of Bitcoins success.
Like you said "we will know during the next bull run".... In the meantime we can enjoy watching  Bitcoin grow and continue evolving.

There are 3 other Bitcoin ATMs within a 5 minute walk of this new one. Thats 4 within a block from each other, 2 are within 100 meters of this new one.
The rates still are higher than using the in person exchange Montreal which is in the old Port (also surrounded by Bitcoin ATMs) but the rate is reasonable especially if you value privacy.
I like the in person location
They sell hardware wallets and cryptos books and are a hub for meetups and seminars.... A great place to meet people.
These in person locations are what opened the door to meeting real people in the space and Im pretty sure its those in person  relationships that made the difference in getting into Bitcoin. The value of talking to someone you know and trust about what is fud or hype is invaluable. 
Thank you to the Bitcoin Embassy and meetups in general for creating that space for me and so many others.

What I like is we have been "relatively" stable for price for the last 4 months... During the last 4 months Bitcoin has had 3,significant price lows, the first low was on Feb 6th.
Heres the good news each low has been higher than the previous low. This wouldn't be so relevant if it was over 21 days, but its been 4 months of a stable price with higher and higher bottoms.
To be fair I need to add that BTC price highs have been getting lower too over the last 4 months...so higher lows and lower highs...and generally a much more stable price.
At 4 months the evidence and psychologically around BTC reaching having reached its price bottom is getting stronger by the day.
People are feeling more comfortable beginning to accumulate BTC again... Every month in this  price range that passes, looks more and more like 2016....where many people accumulated the entire time.
Its nice to see real signs that we may have bottomed or at least real signs of support getting stronger by the day. 
I want the price to moon tomorrow, BUT if I can accumulate for the next few months or even next year will likely be the best scenario that could happen to many of us, who decide to accumulate again.

Nothing wrong with buying $100 in Bitcoin. I've  even  bought $40 worth.
Personally I see Bitcoin as type of savings account.... To store some value (and other uses) why not add $100 here and there?
Everyone I know who owns Bitcoin and has stuck with it started small, its great way to get comfortable using a wallet and playing around with transactions without worrying about some  mistake that  we make more often when we're new. (although everything is so much user friendly than just 1 year ago, it's still a good idea)
Then keep dollar cost averaging... BTC has been stable for the last 4 months... Accumulate all summer if you can

We could see many many many times more transactions in a single block, or other things being secured by the blockchain say paying a fee for the security. Side chains with smart contracts will pay fees or commissions or autonomous organizations will pay a commission to run on top of the block chain.
market forces will create demand for miners in some way

Ive never gone to a meetup and met someone running a node for BCH, only Bitcoin and I intentionally ask, since finding out hundreds of Bitcoin cash nodes were registered to a single entity in China, but creating the impression they were being run by individual enthusiasts.
Thats more centralized, but also misleading the community.

Is this different than the Recksplorer many of us having been watching grow for the last 10 weeks? I noticed the recksplorer reached 1008 nodes a day or 2 ago and hasn’t grown since.
It usually adds 10 to 50 nodes per day...so no new growth has me asking if we should be watching the new mainnet grow somewhere, where?

Remembering Bitcoins epic return from the $6k bottom!
The deep "V shaped" bottom BTC price made on Feb 6th has proven to be an epic support level, and on that February day, blood ran in the streets of crypto, and fear gripped the hearts of many. The weak hands were gripped by fear and sold in a panic at any price, and those who bought, that same day, are people who saw value for half price, those are the ones not controlled by emotions, and they profited the very next next day, within 14 days those people who bought when the streets were red with blood and panic were way up, and had the pleasure of choosing to sell at nearly 100% gains or keep holding for the longer term. A perfect example of the kind of choice we want to be faced with....Especially compared to selling out of fear based emotions, us humans and our emotions, when will we finally learn not to feel?

Can anyone confirm if the Lightning Network is considered anonymous to transact on?
Technically almost nothing can be truly anonymous, but compared to the Bitcoin main block-chain, would I correct to say that transactions on LN are anonymous? I think the answer is yes, I've never heard of LN channel analysis being done before.

Last year Twitter banned me for reporting one of these scams.
@_date: 2018-03-19 06:24:18
This was the first video I made about Lightning Network, or crypto at all.
After 2 years of learning all I could think about was Bitcoin and the Bitcoin protocol I was so inspired by getting to see how fast nodes were going up and I still use this link below to check.
 
Later I made a few more videos tracking Lightning Network growth, basically I was just really excited to see this happening.
As I progressed the production quality of videos has gotten better, this was my first video, so I learned all I could about Bitcoin but very little about making a video and editing a vid (they are getting better). Within weeks of this 1st video I was steadily moving along the learning curve and the video quality eventually began getting better, about Feb 25th I invested in a decent mic, and that helped. “Why I like Red Pulse token”:is my final video with no mic, and it made things a lot easier. I’m slowly getting better at the quality of video,production, but even in the 1st video I made the message was always understood and the point got across,
I’m grateful for how much I’ve learned about Bitcoin, the Bitcoin ecosystem and 2nd layer implementations like Lightning Network. Since I started the channel just 6 weeks ago, I’m learning so much faster, I always loved digging for research, then reflecting on the data to take action or not. I love to dig and research a lot,from how many new Bitcoin ATMs are going up each month in different cities and tracking that volume the Bitcoin ATMs are getting,,and what kind of people use them. (I’ve seen lineups at Bitcoin ATMs early Sunday mornings and the line is female and adult dancers...I assume they work a d dance all night Making cash and then stop at a Bitcoin ATM to buy BTC (I was surprised at how many people use BTC, it’s enjoyable, and possibly most important is just how friendly the people are at a Bitcoin meet-up. Making new friendships will in time result in friends walking you through claiming things like Bitcoin private or Super Bitcoin or Bitcoin Diamond and there will be more hard forked coins from Bitcoin, it pays. But always get to know the person a bit, and always empty the Trezor or Ledger Nano-wallet of Bitcoin and other coins before you give it to them, just to be safe. (Them BTC isn’t needed to get a new hard fork coin, even if you spend your Bitcoin as long as you help the BTC at the fork date, you,can get the new coin even months later, so no rush.
And it’s ok to ask people for directions to do it yourself or for them to claim it with you together. Finally make sure the meet up member is well known and respected. Many people will ask for a percentage of around 20-25% of the free bitcoin they will get you, remember there’s no rush, so make sure you give them an empty wallet to work with, especially if fees are cheap like they are now. $0.65 in fees to keep your coins safe.
The purpose of this post is to illustrate that going to meet ups is one of the best decisions I’ve made and most others agree. Going to meet-ups is a changer for the better. And it’s at meet-ups, where I began learning about Lightning Network in a meaningful way

There are a lot of answers.
One is the fees are even lower on Lightning than the main Bitcoin block chain. And Lightning will handle far more transactions than the main blockchain without those fees increasing.
So saving money is one reason.
Also it’s faster to send money to someone with lightning than with major alternatives like western union or SWIFT.
Sending money to someone in another country can really take awhile....and cost a lot.
They need all kinds of ID info to send wire transfers or Western Union or SWIFT payment, Lightning doesn’t need Any ID or permission, and it takes  seconds....dare I say it’s Lightning fast.
Merchants lose a lot each month to credit card charge backs, this won’t happen with LN. in fact all those terminals and accepting credit cards and debit cards cost merchants money. This removes all that cost, that’s a big incentive. 
The average Joe is often the person who gets credit card fraud or debit card skimmed....
The list goes on...and on.
The average Joe is many parts of the world don’t have a bank account (several billion people), many average joes don’t have the ID for a bank account. Lightning and Bitcoin give the under banked the power to be a part of the economy. Dare I say Lightning and Bitcoin can Bank the unbanked and under banked people of the world.
Lots of people in the USA and developed nations use those check cashing stores to get paid right away because of holds on their bank accounts or they don’t have a bank account....Lightning helps resolve that need.
The most creative entrepreneurs are the ones who will profit from all the creative ways to use this new technology.

I agree it can’t grow forever, but we aren’t even close to the point. In 2018 will we break our ATH maybe, but we will smash through our ATH within the next few years almost with 100% certainty.
Every month Bitcoin stays at these current prices it becomes the new norm, and the idea of $1k BTC from last year seems farther and farther away, and the downside risk gets further and further away.
I don’t mind the market getting boring in BTC we made enough gains to last the next few months...just create new support and I’m happy. But I said this at $3k and it just kept going up...so it could happen anytime, I prefer a slow controlled rise.
Crazy I know.

Becoming totally hooked on the Lightning network, when I saw how many nodes there were today my hands were shaky with joy, remember when Lightning was discussed but the LN project couldn't move forward because we didnt have segwit (Thank you UASF people)...Patience paid off but seeing it become real on mainnet was a surreal experience for me. 
I was ecstatic with joy when I saw how many new nodes we had gained in just a few days. 
Thanks to everyone who has liked the video, commented and subscribed.

To be clear I mentioned the coinbase implementation of Segwit because it's one of the big organizations to implement recently, I think Coinbase could have done it months ago and in NO way at all do I endorse Coinbase.
Regardless of the type of site or application, I'm curious about who needs to adopt segwit for us to reach milestones like 50%. And if they dont adopt Segwit they get left behind.
Samurai seems like the natural fit switch from Mycelium, and if Mycelium doesnt upgrade they will probably get left behind.
Maybe we just need enough patience for people to upgrade to Bitcoin 0.16.0.

Some things I didn’t see on the list, that I think are relevant to Bitcoin over the next year-
Growth in the Bitcoin ATMs economy (within this topic is: ATMs in new countries for the first time, competition and innovation resulting in lower fees and more 2 way Bitcoin ATMs) these have been a wonderful advertising campaign for Bitcoin awareness in countries where many people never heard of Bitcoin before,
Growth in other on ramps to Bitcoin, specifically the Tobacco shops of France, where several thousand are expected to open, and less than 100 have opened in the last 2 months.
Segwit adoption, this is a metric we can monitor more easily and is very relevant to Bitcoin. To see &gt;70% of Bitcoin on chain transactions implement Segwit by the end of 2019 would be very good. Since Segwit began to be  implemented 16 months ago the % has trended upwards and is currently sitting at about 45% of on chain transactions are using Segwit,
Gemini and Binance are 2 examples of  services that process many transactions that still need to implement Segwit. Remember that Coinbase implementing Segwit resulted in roughly an 8% increase alone,

It really seems like Bitcoin has real support in the $7500 area. Each day the market memory factors in these prices as the new normal and Bitcoin has always come back from every a major % drop in over 9 years to rise above the previous all time high and set a new all time high the beats most bullish predictions.
With Bitcoin this has happened every single time with 100% accuracy, this will be no different.

Extremely excited to see that Milestone Bitcoin 0.16.0 is 100% completed. (It was 98% complete the day this video was made) 
This will be a major factor for increasing the rate of Segwit adoption. This means Bech 32 segwit addresses as specified in BIP 0173 which essentially allow Bitcoin to keep evolving further and become faster and better for everyone, allowing all kinds of goodies like the Lightning Network which is extremely exciting.

Still feels good to see a solid bottom formed. And the alts have broken the lows established on that day but Bitcoin didnt, and the BTC market dominance reflects it nicely.
I think if we keep going sideways, we can expect the delisting rate for scammy coins to really sky rocket, and that add to the flight to quality in BTC. I wouldnt mind that.

I want to contribute in a meaningful way to the Bitcoin ecosystem and community. For now I tell people about Bitcoin and attend meetups, and make videos like these. But I do want to do more....I asked to join the Bitcoin Core Slack channel and there was a small paragraph to write explaining why you want to join. I was honest saying my work experience is in the traditional markets and 8 years ago I focused on my high openness, leadership and emotional intelligence to go back to university and get a degree allowing me to be an organizational change agent. I said I have almost no coding skills but really want to contribute to the Bitcoin ecosystem, do you have a place for someone like me? THE RESPONSE I GOT WAS INCREDIBLY SUPPORTIVE and welcoming. People helping me learn the norms of the Bitcoin slack channel, and how it works. Then we found about 9 different tasks I could help with, and since then I've thought of several more tasks (important ones) that most people who don't know how to code can contribute.
That experience with Bitcoin Core and the Bitcoin community as a whole spoke volumes, and I've re told that story at least 10 times now.

We implemented a transaction malleability fix (after a 2+ year debate, finally won and demonstrating anti-fragility in an entire new way for Bitcoin.
My question is regarding all the coins that use Bitcoins open source code, but didn't implement Segwit. The further we go down the road with Segwit releases of software like Bitcoin 0.16.0, am I correct in it becomes more and more difficult to "copy and paste" Bitcoins code? And coins will be forced to some developer work themselves or find another way to keep up?
Is there another malleability fix being used for the coins that were just using Bitcoins code? I know many coins are now Segwit compatible but many haven't....
@_date: 2018-04-12 17:01:02
The volume is epic regardless. 
This will change the trading algorithms to a more bullish tune, and Bitcoin gets some media coverage out if this, and most of all for traders and even long term HODLRS are reminded of the potential for Bitcoin to move up in a very short time. ( I prefer a modest increase over months like last summer) 
Sentiment became more positive and market psychology got a dose of optimism as a result of today's move. 
I personally am excited to see more and more reinforced evidence that the Feb 6th  price low was indeed the bottom.

I rarely comment on short term price but I want to agree the bullish indicators are getting stronger.
We have been consolidating in the low 8K range.. .while very  gently trending upwards since that big pop up on April 12th.
Even if we just stay at these levels and gain 1% per week, as time passes the price low set on Feb 6th becomes more ingrained as a belief that the price did indeed bottom on Feb 6th. And market psychology shifts, as it is already.  We will see more TA charts showing ascending channels using the Feb 6th bottom as a start point and the law permanence sets in.

I got involved with Bitcoin Core (Its anyone can join) and I made it clear that Im not skilled in coding but did list why Im interested and asked is there a place for me here? Is there a way I can contribute? 
That day I got a lot of really plostive replies from people welcoming me and explaining what I can do to add value. Things from translation to using the the latest wallet and(throuh the lens of a non-coder) describing what I thought could be improved on in the software....All kinds of ideas brought up about how someone can contribute who isnt a coder. 
Most of all that experience validated that anyone can join and contribute. It's amazing to realize how many people volunteer and contribute in someway Bitcoin.
That specific experience was with Bitcoin Core, but when I attend a Bitcoin meetup and discuss ideas and the state of Bitcoin, that is not related to Core and I contribute value in diffent ways, one of the bigger ones is by adding to the network effect. Bitcoin doesnt have an advertising budget so simply by learning about Bitcoin and discussing it critically and sharing what works and making contacts to help me see through FUD, helps the network effect. The proof is that we have seen totally new people come to our meetup in Montreal. People who dont fit the demographic at all, females over 40 have come and now they have met people who they can ask for guidance and they have told others about Bitcoin. The list of gifts from meetups keeps growing, everyone who didnt know how safely claim more obscure hard forks, is one of the big gifts (once you build some trust) also people meet members who have a larger amount of Bitcoin who are willing to sell it at a price that beats Local Bitcoins. I personally always want to meet anyone running a node, because Im learning that online bots or trolls create the false impression of community depth. So in person Ive only met people running a Bitcoin node never once a node for a fork of Bitcoin node. We also track other metrics like the amount of new Bitcoin ATMS in town and other leading and coincidental indicators
Anyone getting involved with the community is so worth it, both personally and for the entire ecosystem. 
Hope that didn't digress off topic too badly.

Wallets like exodus and Mycelium are all running “on top” the Bitcoin Core wallet. Does that question make sense? 
I’m considering making a tutorial on the core wallet and a teacher of mine said this, but I’m not certain. (Maybe the tutorial will stay really simple)
Are all the Light wallets running bitcoin core wallets behind the scenes, with the core wallet doing the work and exodus just being a nice user interface on top of it?

Feels a bit tense in here...no, lol.
I’m a long term holder too so I don’t really care the next 48hrs.
But I am watching to see if we stay above that Feb 6th low....why would a long term holder care, because even if those of us who bought over a year are still way up I absolutely do want to see that Feb 6th support level hold, and as we all know, it’s likely that “if” we break below our Feb 6th low, the odds are it will be within the next few weeks. Every week we stay above that support level the law of permanence creeps into investors minds.
For many of us, we still have a hard time buying because we remember buying at cheaper prices. Every week this price becomes more part of what is consider the normal price and the memory of buying $2000 Bitcoin becomes  farther and farther into our memories and replaced with the new norm.
Respecting the support level of Feb 6th is a pretty big deal for me. Because if it doesn’t hold then we need to rebuild the permanence of value at the new price.
Gratitude for the people who haven’t sold. It’s a sign of solidarity that I admire.

Lots of people made life changing money in 2017, many sold half into fiat and despite the price drop are still up 10x .
Assume some big vendor like Amazon gave us a good incentive to spend our bitcoin we would....And they know it.

Gratitude for Bitcoin, 
It is beginning to feel la bit like late last summer again. After the UASF won a 2 year+ very heated debate and Bitcoin finally got a malleability fix implemented. 
IMO that changed everything and demonstrated a whole new level of anti-fragility, within Bitcoin.
Just thank you to everyone in the community. Changed a lot of lives already.

It’s amazing that it’s down so much since the ATH and so many of us are still way up....thank you to everyone who mad this happen, especially the people who kept up the push for Segwit and finally the USAF.
Changed my life, I’m no millionaire and I’m paying my taxes but I got a head start in life and still have some.
Gratitude seriously thank you.

I was just wondering about the same thing, and not just the tariff but on Mar 26 China started trading oil for gold back Chinese Yuan (futures contracts) that was in the the works by China for over 20 years and kept getting delayed and now it’s happening, this is big news.
I want bitcoin to rise but not at the expense of the North American economy....Hope everyone can win, said the eternal optimist

After reflecting on this, there is real merit to the idea, In some ways this is a way for the users to signal, reminding me of just how powerful the UASF and NO2X signaling was. And supply and demand suggest we could all increase our wealth if we just did a little work and put our Bitcoin on a Wallet you control.
Coinbase and Binance dont need to buy new Bitcoin if you never take ownership of it. 
And of course the price would benefit all of us if even a few percent of people decided to hold their coins off exchanges,

Love this movie. I’m surprised we haven’t had a Bitcoin version sooner.

I can see his point, Im not as knowledgeable as he is, but I know Bitcoin success includes a world where it becomes easier to have a real time, open source copy of the ledger. It’s our ledger, it’s the main thing and we need it to become easier to verify not harder.
That’s a key pillar of Bitcoin. The average citizen MUST be able to verify without trusting a third party. 
We need to make it easier and cheaper to have a real copy of the blockchain, not longer and more expensive. 
It’s our ledger....the goddam ledger that everyone can see update in real time. That is critical to keep.
Blocks will get more efficient without getting bigger.  I want  to strive for a world where it’s easy to have na open source gossiping node updating in real time to be on my average laptop all running in an afternoon, and then one day (eventually) in under an hour  on a mobile phone. That would change the world....let’s make it easier to run a node not harder.

Well there are lots of groups working on Lightning Network now. BOLT standard 1.0 was agreed on over a year ago, but earlier this fall BOLT standard 1.1 was agreed on and that let everyone know the same rule set to work with making things much more secure. Within weeks of BOLT 1.1 the amount of Bitcoin in the Lightning Network increased massively, probably because it became much more secure with a new agreed rule set.
Eventually they will update BOLT again and again and again.
But also wallets for lightning like Zap wallet or getting updated and updated. And another metric of Lightning’s growth is Segwit adoption, which makes Lightning much more realistic, and the 2-3;years that Segwit  was effectively delayed slowed down Lightning’s development considerably. (It was still being worked on in testnet though, so research and testing it was never halted.
It’s growing, but Lightning, like Bitcoin and like the Internet will never really be done improving,
