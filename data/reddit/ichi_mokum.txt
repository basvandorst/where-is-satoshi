I believe that's based on wisdom of the crowd, not AI, right?

I could use some HODL energy rn...

Why is this such a stupid sentence? Pls elaborate
@_date: 2019-07-04 09:56:17
I think you just described the difference

Who cares though, more time for me to buy

How come the halving will be before Bitcoin's halving?

Not sure what you're getting at, but in December 2017, average transaction fee peaked at $40 per transaction. Everyone was underpaying.

I think this has always been quite similar tbh. Very often, there are early adopters who have to convince the 'mainstream' of new technologies. People are naturally fearful towards new technologies, it's the classic argument of people thinking trains were devil's work when they first saw them. 
The problem with crypto is the fact that for many people it's a bit more difficult to understand why it's useful. The benefits of a train are very straightforward, whereas many people who hear of blockchain for the first time get dizzy in the head. 
As long as we understand the benefits and further development unfolds, people will start using it without having any clue about how it works. That's when real adoption starts, no one knows how the internet works and as long as the applications work, there's no need to. 
I'm very convinced we're not in an echo chamber as pretty much every major multinational company is currently working on implementing Blockchain technology.

Make sure you really know what you're doing before starting to short. It takes very hard work and a lot of failures before you'll be successful as a trader. This is not an easy game and if you're not 100% committed, it's probably better to just dollar cost average and hold for the long run.

Thanks, I just sprayed coffee all over my laptop

Are you collecting old private keys? That's kinda hilarious, how much for a private key from 2013?
@_date: 2019-06-13 10:57:09
Why would you waste so much money on killing competitors if you can just buy more crypto? Remember that a 51% attack is very expensive and the results are limited, a lot of people seem to think you can just do anything with the network once you 51% attacked it. This is NOT TRUE, the only thing that it allows you to do is to double spend. If you would start 51% attacking random altcoins without buying a big portion of it first, it would be useless. It would make much more sense to just buy a very big chunk of a low cap altcoin and start controlling the price.

Still, you could compare it to a bicycle race where you're only focused on trying to give your opponents a flat tire. You would have to waste so many resources, it would work against you.

What are you talking about? Bitcoin and the wider infrastructure is constantly evolving.

I've been trading Bitcoin since 2013 and I'd say it's probably best to sell about 75% now, set some sell orders at 9,6k and a little bit at 11k.
Set the 75% you sell now as buy orders between 6 and 7,5k. This bull run will definitely not make it till the end of June. There's a good chance we'll see a blow-off top soon.
@_date: 2019-05-28 17:12:54
This a completely different point tbh...

This is a Bitcoin subreddit, so I want the connection to be clear. I love Bitcoin and I'm not blaming anything.
