Good point, but don't you think there could be something along the lines of a Bitpay system for transferring funds? If it works for merchant transactions than it could surely work for personal ones.

If you can ship them out of country I'm sure some people in Reddit would buy them. I'd buy them myself but I can't pay you as much as they are probably worth.

Unless I'm mistaken you have 30 days to repurchase and investment after you sell it before you are liable for capital gains.

I don't think you have any clue how about what you're talking about.

As someone who lost all their BTC on mtgox I can't recommend strongly enough that everyone take this advice to heart. I just migrated my BTC to a hardware wallet and it was VERY easy. I'm confident anyone, with minimal computer literacy, can use a hardware wallet like Ledger.

Do you want to sell the miners?

I don't see much of a reason to be bearish on the price right now. I added 1.7 Btc pre crash and Im not worried in the slightest.

That depends entirely on each individuals reason for buying btc to begin with.

They are never going to stop

Bitcoins can be lost forever though. So at some point the available coins will be decreasing...

I was under the impression that the new amd voltas were poor cards for mining. The power draw is huge and they aren't any more powerful than the 1080s. Have I got it wrong?

That's a pretty absurd conclusion to reach from what he wrote. Honestly you are the one who sounds ignorant of other crypto protocols when you are so quick to dismiss al the other coins and their unique techs that have and will continue to erode btc' market share. Btc is very likely going to remain the dominant coin for the foreseeable future but you shouldn't dismiss other technologies so swiftly.

He pulled them out of his ass.

I did the same thing with my daughter! Bought it for 1100. I hope when she's 25 it can be a nice surprise to help her start her adult life.

Didn't India just elect a president from the bottom caste or something similar.
@_date: 2017-08-31 19:04:30
Even an overpriced 1080 might be better in the long run due to the lower power draw of the card.

Gold is the best conductor of electricity at room temperature. That's why it's in a lot of electronics. It has other useful properties as well such as being non reactive. I believe he is wrong because he assumed that crypto currencies have no intrinsic value. However we know that software can have intrinsic value. Windows is immensely valuable for example. The bitcoin protocol has value the network has value.

That's awesome! I always chuckle about how my 19 month old daughter has more money in her savings account than I do. For what financial / parenting advice from a total stranger over the internet is worth. I suggest waiting longer than 18 to give a kid a large sum of money. I know when I was younger I wouldn't have used the money wisely to build my future. That takes maturity that I didn't have at the time!

I believe he is referring to the stupidity of the customers for having kept their coins on an exchange rather than in a wallet.

The initial fees were pants on head retarded. 1% interest PER MONTH. These guys lost my business the moment I read that.

I don't really feel comfortable trading for a few hundred dollars in person. Seems risky.
@_date: 2013-04-09 20:02:32
I was unclear. I mean the BTC was headed towards cents having more value. Not that BTC was headed in the direction of the dollar.

I thought we all agreed the ddoser was a fag. And thus nobody needed to day it.
@_date: 2013-12-31 23:43:50
I don't follow how it would reduce liquidity for people who are using it as a currency. Could you elaborate?
@_date: 2013-04-09 15:07:52
This could be because cents have very little value today. They buy almost nothing and hardly anyone looks at them these day. Many years ago you paid for many things with only cents. It made more sense to have a symbol for cents back then. And this is the direction btc is headed.

So... you can buy babies with btc now?
