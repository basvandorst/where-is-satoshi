honestly, i dont like this. its a shame. i trusted this company to hold my coins since 2013, and they've done a pretty damn good job. Better than I can ask from any other exchange.
But...I don't like this. The hubris...the out of touchness.....he's begging, BEGGING, to be replaced by something superior.
Coinbase was the Myspace of exchanges. It's obvious now. What will replace it is the question? (Hint: I don't see its replacement anywhere.)

You need death. Because..you need life  after death. You need a legacy. You need something to show that you remain, and the quality of your remains is what will dictate “how long” after death you get to live. Actual immortality makes life meaningless. “Oh..I only have an infinite number of years to accomplish it, so I’ll just chill for now.”
When “life” was first designed, the first line of code was to include “death”. It is the most fundamental part of life. That you are finite. That you will disappear, and the only thing that will remain is your “legacy”, however you define it.

I agree with every one of your points, OP. Great post.
The security issue will be the biggest obstacle to widespread adoption. People need something they can trust or at least be insured in.

Turns out bitcoins don't actually exist.
Except in our hearts.

tfw in the future each coin is like owning a real estate property today   
tfw in the past a real estate property was as cheap as a  bitcoin today

in summary:
1. They did almost no work. An obvious and simple fork of BTC
2. They try to profit off the Bitcoin name
3. They try to steal the Bitcoin name
4. If they didn't to  and  it would just be another Megacoin or other bullshit altcoin that nobody cares about

If things go as this article predicts, BTC will literally be taking me to the moon. Paid for by bitcoin of course :)

It's actaully not that hard. Every trade  I've made so far have been profitable. In the past two weeks, it's not hard to tell that buying coins at over $1,000 is not a good idea, and selling it under $1,000 is not a good idea..
45/35 for lite coins, respectively.

I'm surprised by this; although Korea is quick to adopt new technologies, I feel like bitcoins wouldn't be there thing.
Hopefully this starts a trend in Korea

Sadly I don't think there is much we can do about this. If Eobot refunds the commission expenses, there's not much more you can ask for.
All I will say is:
Just see this as one stepback in an ovreall trend towarsd making money off this stuff. I lost 4k profit on this, but made 2k profit from coinbase. I am viewing this as a one month setback, of what should be a very profitable year if coins keep growing the way I think they will.
Keep fighting bros
