Great, more of the reverse psychology "is an idiot" marketing in order to boost name recognition. Why do the mods let this person advertise on @_date: 2017-02-22 05:06:13
This is the only thing going to the moon: 
Over 70,000 unconfirmed transactions, and fees higher than credit cards and bank transfers.
Adam Back doesn't get to take credit for the Bitcoin price. He's done nothing but hurt Bitcoin. The price increases are from rumors around the Winklevoss ETF, and other ETFs that are less public.
The 1MB blocksize is keeping Bitcoin's price down, and lightning networks aren't proven or used by actual Bitcoin users.
Wonder how long before this post is censored?

Bitcoin isn't just about software. It's about network effect and technical investment of the industry using the protocol. Most of us want to see Bitcoin scale past 1MB, but the current team is tap dancing and stalling around this for years. 


Using this logic the BU developers are more competent than core, as BU now receives more zotes than SF Segwit.
BU's team is not more technically competent than core, but they get more zotes. That's because it's ridiculous to think that technical competence is the only factor in play.
It's about releasing software that will benefit those casting zotes. BU's software is much closer to giving people what they want, which will help adoption, increase the price, and bring a more fortuitous future.
It's about listening to users, trust, and leadership as much as it is about competence. Core is epically failing in every category above *except* competence. That's why SFSW doesn't activate. They troll competing developers, act in a toxic manner, assassinate peoples' character, fail as leaders, and break their word. 
Who wants to run software that manages our electronic cash coded by  we don't trust? Not me. No way.

That is a lie. Read their SEC filings.

3 tps and constant backlogs are the only staggering thing about it. Epic fail and stagnation ever since Gavin left.

No, no it's not. It's risky, complicated, changes fee economics, and isn't the simplest solution to our immediate problems.
SegWit should have been released as a hard fork in combination with a 2MB blocksize increase, as promised and discussed.
Soft fork SegWit is a hack, jacks up the coinbase transaction, and alters the transaction fee weight of signature data, altering Bitcoin's fee economics.
I don't want a bunch of C++ monkey's who don't understand business or economics, divide the community, and clearly are influenced by outside money changing Bitcoin's fees without any deliberation with users or the community.
Soft fork SegWit is not "better/safer". It's a freaking trojan horse for toxic people who have coopted Bitcoin from Gavin, Marti Malmi, and the early developers who had their hearts in the right place.

If you've been here since 2009, then you know exactly what's up.
Yes, we should be prioritizing a scaling solution for Bitcoin first, and well ahead of RBF, SegWit, and other development efforts. 
Yes, the price of Bitcoin is very much based on its utility as a currency and a store of value, and those two things are inseparable, as incredibly expensive fees and unpredictable confirmation times erode and eventually destroy its ability to function as a peer to peer electronic cash.
Yes, the people promoting FUD and brinksmanship about larger blocks in any capacity are sometimes paid by special interests, and there is a concerted psyops campaign attacking Bitcoin.
BIP101 was a reasonable way to scale, tracking well under Moore's law. With short term fixes to O(n)2 quadratic hashing issues found in the XT code, we could easily be at 8MB right now, and still be growing our user base.
Longer term, I think a flexcap solution where coinbase reward degradation is tied to transaction fees and a target reward is the way to manage block size, but I digress.
What we needed two years ago was another hard fork to address the backlog. The people promoting Bitcoin Limited are not cut from the same cloth as you from 2009, or me from 2010. They are, well, agents for banksters.

Why are you bringing up Roger out of left field, exactly?
Perhaps you don't realize SM was toxic because you are toxic?

So go ahead and run your AXA software - most other rational people will not.
You aren't a Bitcoin old timer. [Your first post is two years ago about sidechains.](
Bitcoin old timers know sidechains don't work. 
Asymmetricly pegged chains hurt Bitcoin by draining value out, so no rational user would ever consider changing the Bitcoin network to support them, because they are parasitic (not at all unlike your company blockstream). 
Symmetric pegged sidechains are no better than merged mining, and are vulnerable to reorg attacks and all sorts of other issues because they have only SPV level security. Ask Onename about how merged mined Namecoin worked out for them...

Are you saying that we did not have a h4rd f0rk on Aug 16 13?
I've provided evidence that's irrefutable. Do you have an actual argument?
Please stay on topic, thanks.
@_date: 2017-02-15 03:34:22
I never said it doesn't increase capacity.
We need to hard fork in order to increase capacity and scale bitcoin's ability to process more transactions per second long term. 
Bitcoin's natural throughput can and should easily map 1:1 with increases in computing speed and efficiency. The o(n)2 scaling issue FUD has already been addressed.
The more this event is delayed, the harder it becomes to do.
People who endlessly procrastinate and delay Bitcoin's hard fork, pretend that payment channels are the only answer, and mislead others about its history (pretending it never hard forked before, when it did in August 2013), are acting in bad faith.

Not Roger. Hint: you are outnumbered.

I think the challenge with Bitcoin is the reason that some are doing the work.
The white elephant in the room is that there are different types of "people doing the work".
There are some that have no financial conflicts, and are doing it because they want to see Bitcoin succeed / the price go up.
There are others that market the fact that they have no financial conflicts, but consistently and systematically push the development of Bitcoin in a direction that is wildly unpopular with the user base.
Linus is assuming good intent. Unfortunately, Bitcoin carries much higher risks of bad actors than Linux ever has or will, because it's not just software. It's a payment system and currency as well. That attracts a lot of bad people and a lot of money that may have other interests. We don't talk about that enough around here...

You are incorrect and the sources listed in the link above offer no proof. They are deceiving us and spreading misinformation.
FYI, my reply to you was c3ns0red. You also did not continue the conversation when I pinged your username from another forum.
Bitcoin has had a h4rd f0rk, regardless of how you define the events from Aug '10 and Mar '13. 
There was a planned h4rd f0rk in Aug '13. It was even called a "flag day" event. Go run client version 0 .7 .2 and let it sync. You will not be on today's blockchain when you hit height 25 2 45 1 . The evidence is irrefutable.

I would zote for Segwit, but it has to be in software coded by a team that is not funded by Blockstream.
I'm mystified why would encourage us to zote for Segwit when doing so would only further cement the current defacto monopoly centralization of Bitcoin development.

So much time and energy spent assassinating Gavin's character, and now you put words in his mouth too?
@_date: 2017-02-22 15:57:41
What? I've been here since late 2010, understand finance, economics, and have read the C++ more than I know. I understand Bitcoin. It's peer to peer electronic cash. It was meant to be in the hands of more people when its ready. The white paper did not have a a clause about a bank funded startup deciding when it's ready as an autocratic function.
@_date: 2017-02-15 02:20:34


Oh come on... payment channels are a great idea, but the bottom line is, we don't have a widely used, functional payment channel in use today. That means that there is a very high risk that either these technologies simply won't be adopted widely by users, or won't function with the same attributes that today's bitcoin users find valuable. 
I do not believe or agree that we should put all of our eggs in one basket, especially when the eggs are still imaginary.
We need to scale Bitcoin with a hard fork. A year ago. Focusing on payment channels and completely ignoring Bitcoin's backlog is blatant negligence on the part of core developers.
@_date: 2017-02-22 20:39:03
Nailed it. What's more?
We hard forked in August 2013 with two months of planning. 
Go sync the blockchain using a pre August 2013 Bitcoin-QT client. You will not be on today's blockchain. 
So what happened when we hard forked on two months' notice? 
Absolutely nothing. People upgraded or backported, and Bitcoin ran just fine, just like it does today.
What makes any change risky is the extent and complexity of the change, not whether we think it's backwards compatible when its released and call it a soft fork.
In fact, the most dangerous and destructive releases in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies were almost universally soft forks, until they were released, and they blew everything up and ended up being hard forks.
Don't fall for their tricks or participate in that false narrative. The hard fork vs. soft fork debate is a huge con-game and a lie.
