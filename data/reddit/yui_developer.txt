Krugman needs to bend the knee to Bitcoin like Dimon did. Is Krugman the new Dimon for this sub?

But, someone never receives Bitcoin in the case of futures. However, they may receive a barrel of oil. That's the heart of this. 
If Bitcoin isn't exchanged, only dollars are exchanged, then its no different than gambling. If Bitcoin was delivered, then I could see a difference. I'm simply saying when only cash is exchanged, it's no different than gambling.

Those other commodities and currencies are often delivered physically to the investor though if their bet falls through right? For example, if you place a future bet on a barrel of oil, you could end up with a barrel of oil.

Are they the cause, or is it just coincidence, that Bitcoin continues to slide since the intro of futures? 
I’ve never understood how Bitcoin futures are any different than gambling. Especially since Bitcoin is never delivered if the gambler, I mean investor, is wrong. Is there a difference?

That's my entire point. Saying "that's the market" doesn't differentiate from what's actually happening. In a *market*, a good or service is *exchanged*. The only thing getting *exchanged* with Bitcoin futures are dollars, not the good or service itself.
If an asset (i.e. Bitcoin) is never exchanged (i.e. delivered), it's not a market. It's just gambling. That's fine if that's what it is. But, let's call a spade a spade. Giving something an official sounding name is just misleading. 
I would really like to see a court differentiate between futures and gambling. If an asset/good/service actually gets exchanged, then you have a market. Without an actual exchange of an asset/good/service, I really don't see how its any different than gambling.

You should be able to transfer fiat to Coinbase and purchase from there.

Pretty cool! Is this open sourced? If so, is there a repo address?

If the financial economists knew so much, why did the 2007-2008 credit crisis happen? Why did Equifax happen?

Same domain, but two different answers. One says he's on pace to avoid this scenario. The other says, he'll be eating his ... words.
