@_date: 2017-12-27 02:38:05
Should i risk it? 
@_date: 2017-12-24 05:49:26
Well its about changing fiat money to crypto. Just keep on buying! 
@_date: 2017-12-27 02:12:34
Say you buy at 16k. Using Coinbase there is a 4% fee when buying. So you'll have a value of a little under $1000. You wait until that value is $2000 and sell. When selling there is the fee again. So its your value of $2000 minus the fee and then minus your initial investment of $1000 to get your net profit. 
In theory.
@_date: 2017-12-25 23:34:57
Where can i get one?
@_date: 2017-12-29 19:29:11
