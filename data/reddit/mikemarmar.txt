The bitfinex hack drained multi-sig addresses, which start with a 3. The outputs that spend to 1BfxSuxJqXuizBbTcP238JZY9DT4eqvzJG (and the outputs that spend to those inputs on 7/30) aren't multi-sig.

Yes, assuming you have enough other income that you have to pay taxes.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:19:38
I am not a tax professional but this is my understanding:
In addition to paying taxes on a sale of BTC to USD (or exchange of bitcoin for goods or services), you also need to pay taxes on any exchange between different coins. For example, selling BTC for ETH is a taxable event, unless you intend to treat it as a like-kind exchange, which from my understanding will very likely not pass muster with the IRS.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:20:17
Unfortunately it's not up to you. You should do your own research, but if you still decide to treat coin to coin exchange as a like kind exchange, you have to file form 8824 for each such exchange. So, the administrative burden is no less. If you don't file that form, the exchange is not like kind and will be taxed as capital gains (along with penalties if you are caught avoiding it).

The daily volume of BTC (across all markets) is $10B - $20B. On gdax alone it is upwards of $100M or more. So $86M spread across a few weeks won't really impact the markets all that much.
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:49:13
The IRS treats that the same as a sale for cash. If I buy a $10,000 car for 1BTC, then I have to pay taxes as if I sold that bitcoin for $10,000 cash.

I would not recommend securing 0.25BTC with a device that costs $120...that just doesn't make sense. 
@_date: 2014-12-08 18:35:50
Yes. That user (johoe) runs a script that monitors transactions for weak keys. There are probably many others that do the same.

See 
First, 1FYMZEHnszCHKTBdFZ2DLrUuk3dGwYKQxh is an invalid address, and is the result of choosing a bad exponent (0) when generating the address. It is possible that you hit a bug in Multibit that caused change addresses to be generated in this way. That is speculation though.
Second, the coins that have been sent to 1FYMZEHnszCHKTBdFZ2DLrUuk3dGwYKQxh are stuck there. While it is actually possible for anyone to generate a mathematically "valid" signature for that address, the 0 exponent is not allowed, and that signature will be rejected by the network. So, there is no way to get your coins out of that address.
Edit: I would recommend contacting the developers of MultiBit directly. If you can prove that you own 1rzhWUU... and that the bad transactions were in fact generated by MultiBit they may be persuaded to compensate you. Also, if this is a bug in MultiBit it should be fixed ASAP

It seems quite risky for a miner to fill blocks with their own transactions in order to increase the max block size so that they can potentially mine more transactions in the future during peak periods.
By including their own transactions, a miner increases their own orphan risk without collecting any additional fees. This is clearly against their own short term economic interests. The density of transactions during peak periods is highly variable and difficult to predict. Thus, I doubt that a miner would potentially sacrifice block rewards now for the possibility of a few more transaction fees in the future.
@_date: 2016-03-21 21:14:24
Both good points. A pool would certainly have to broadcast the transactions, but put low enough fees on them so as not to risk losing a lot of coin. In that case, the pool would essentially be spamming the network with low fee transactions, then mining those transactions. Mining a large number of very low fee transactions would probably be detectible behavior.
@_date: 2016-03-21 20:56:27
Yeah that is definitely a possibility. It seems that it would take the collusion of at least 50% of the actual hashrate (not just hashrate representation) to pull this attack off.
@_date: 2016-03-21 20:39:29
That's a good point. So, assuming that orphan risk no longer provides downward pressure on block size, what other factors will come into play? Bandwidth? Validation time?
With IBLT and faster validation, it seems that a lot of the resource consumption on full nodes due to large blocks is alleviated. With those features in place, what factors make large blocks unsafe for full nodes?
@_date: 2016-03-21 20:29:39
Interesting. Since the new limit is calculated as the median of the previous 12960 blocks, this attack relies on at least 50% of the previous 12960 blocks being produced by miners that want large blocks. Of course with mining already fairly centralized, this is a real possibility. 
@_date: 2016-03-21 21:04:26
Yes, but I wonder how detectable this block stuffing attack would actually be. A malicious pool (or pools) could use proxies to generate the transactions, then include them in the block. It might not be possible for miners in the pool to determine which transactions were just generated by the pool operator and which are normal transaction.
@_date: 2016-03-21 22:38:15


Correlation != Causation. There are factors beyond block size that have contributed to the reduction of nodes. Lite/SPV wallets that use close to zero bandwidth (will never be the case for full nodes), and web wallets such as coinbase, etc are likely the primary factors. If those wallets and services did not exist, full node count would be much higher.
@_date: 2016-03-21 19:40:28
Can you expand on some of the potential explots?
@_date: 2016-03-21 20:09:53
The end game when the block reward is ~0 is definitely an interesting case. How does the adaptive block size play into it? Just like they do today, it seems that miners will want to balance the marginal cost of including a transaction (orphan risk) against the fee provided by that transaction. 
How does adding an additional "tail end emission" block reward change the incentives?
@_date: 2016-03-21 20:01:48
Yes, I understand that it might be possible for miners to game this algorithm. u/BashCo has indicated that the community has already discussed some such exploits. I am interested in what those exploits might be.
@_date: 2016-03-21 22:03:47
Of course 50% of the hash rate can attack bitcoin. What is important is that we don't open up attack vectors that 50% can exploit *without anyone noticing*.
I am not yet convinced that this proposal is exploitable in such a discreet way.

In the US at least, many utilities will buy excess solar energy back from homes that produce it at the market rate. So, depending on energy costs in your area it may be more profitable to sell that energy to the grid instead of mining with it.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:30:39
Well, good luck with that lawsuit I guess.
@_date: 2017-11-30 23:11:12
This is awesome.
You should always include at least a date, and probably your username in a message you are going to sign for proof of address ownership. With this signature, anyone can come by next year and "prove" ownership of that address with the same message.
@_date: 2016-02-18 19:11:11
Do you have a link to such a proposal? I am interested as it seems that the obvious ways to prevent such mining behavior are easily gamed.
@_date: 2016-02-18 14:37:51
Even if transactions came with 1BTC fees, miners would still mine empty blocks. They only do this during the period in which they are still validating the previous block and thus cannot determine which transactions are safe to include in the next block. It has nothing to do with fees.
@_date: 2016-02-18 14:30:36
~~It has close to zero effect on transactional capacity~~. Empty block hashing only occurs during the period in which a miner cannot determine what transactions are OK to include in the next block or not. If a miner does not hash empty blocks during validation, they have to simply wait.
The only marginal negative effect (as u/runekri3 out) is that on the occasion that an empty block is found, there is a slight delay in the network (really, a slight increase of orphan risk) as that empty block propagates and miners switch to hashing the next block. This delay is very small, as an empty block is very small and quick to propagate.

You are either being disingenuous, or you don't understand how Open Source software works. Given your long time devotion to Bitcoin and position in the community, I have a hard time believing it is the latter.
The whole point of Open Source is that by "copying vigorously", the end product is better. Having two competing implementations is a good thing. Try not to take it personally, most of the community values your contributions. Classic is not stealing your work, just as you are not stealing the work of those that worked on bitcoin before and alongside you.
@_date: 2016-02-18 15:53:57
Ok yes I understand your point now. Difficulty adjusts based on total hashpower (approximately). If some of that hashpower is mining empty blocks, then on average the network will produce fewer non-empty blocks than it could otherwise per unit time.
Empty blocks are very small and take almost no time to validate. So, they only barely consume real resources (bandwidth, CPU, storage costs). Therefore, a reduction in transactional capacity only happens if there are other forces keeping the non-empty blocks from including every available transaction. These forces are blocksize cap and orphan risk (which of course interact with each other as orphan risk increases with block size). 
Sort of a side note, but your point about miners suddenly not exhibiting this behavior is specious. Miners see real gain from this behavior with no downside for them, so they would never stop doing it.
@_date: 2016-02-10 20:01:54
Are you saying you would rather Bitcoin be closed source? That's a non starter

Quote from next message in the thread:


clear that this issue does not effect any released version of FreeBSD.
It only effects people who run -current.
