PS : Its a GOOD NEWS Guys. Not a Bad one.
@_date: 2013-12-07 19:08:53

@_date: 2013-12-06 12:32:10

@_date: 2013-12-07 19:40:08

@_date: 2013-12-07 19:48:33
Haha true that. It would be really awesome if we get it. 
@_date: 2013-11-26 22:14:14
Lucky indeed. Congrats to you.
@_date: 2013-11-26 22:01:51
I wish I would have done it like you. Atleast people who read this message wont fall into trap unless they know what they are doing.
@_date: 2013-11-19 11:11:09
Wow are people really so generous. Seriously Why is my luck so bad no one gives me o.0 
@_date: 2013-11-30 18:22:12
Thanks :)
@_date: 2013-12-07 19:10:28
Yea, but at times it gets cumbersome. Considering if you have 10+ Coins and 10+ Wallets. Could be irritating for sure.
@_date: 2013-12-07 19:05:06
Oh wow. Checking it out. Thanks
@_date: 2013-12-06 12:32:30
@_date: 2013-12-07 19:00:53
Yea, Whoever does it. Is surely gonna go big. 
@_date: 2013-11-26 21:55:48
Well, you can play. No issues with that. But don't believe people and Disable the Chatbox when you are in BTC-E.
@_date: 2013-11-26 22:14:59
Ya can be used for entertainment for sure. But who are new to the site don't understand that or rather dont know that.
@_date: 2013-12-07 18:51:54
You ugly cunt go mind your own business. Who the fuck is saying you something ? Are you so jobless that you are commenting on any post you get or are you Fontas trying to defend yourself. FUCK OFF. Don't Piss me ugly piece of shit.
@_date: 2013-11-26 22:02:50
Well, Weak hands ? I saw people loose thousands of dollars weak or strong that is a huge amount. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 19:41:00
I don't really think its impossible. But does require effort. 
@_date: 2013-11-26 22:12:42
But People did follow and this post is a warning to them so that they don't follow again. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 17:32:28
Speaking about FONTASS I belive ?
@_date: 2013-11-26 22:10:08
But the site becomes slow as shit when that happens and it will go to Sell/Buy Order instead. There were more thousands of people online at that moment. But Good point you got over here.
@_date: 2013-12-05 14:46:05
The news from China is* gud you morans.
@_date: 2013-11-19 18:09:24
Ah. I didnt signup for it. Damn. Could you resend it 
@_date: 2013-12-07 19:47:41
Haha lol. Well one wallet can have multiple Sections in it. Which does it for specific coins. Not sure. Lets just see in the future. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 13:15:52
Aww. Didn't get any yet. maybe Reddit hates me.
@_date: 2013-12-07 19:29:14
Haha. True. Should be available soon seeing the market now. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 19:07:23
I see. But the people who are using it. It would become easier for them to manage rather than holding them at multiple places.
@_date: 2013-11-26 21:54:51
Yea. I Saw the chatbox and people lost hundreds and thousands of money. That is sad.
@_date: 2013-11-23 19:09:53
ATM realised its better to HOLD it then sell it :D
@_date: 2013-11-27 20:21:24

@_date: 2013-12-06 14:34:28

@_date: 2013-11-28 13:16:13
BitCoins are going good. But some fellas take advantage of people being newbie and lure them into investing on something which they shouldn't. I hope this is reduced so more and more people can join Bitcoins and have fun.
@_date: 2013-11-26 22:00:35
I agree. But Don't you think there are rarely any honest man ? Everyone wants quick money and if they fall into this trap they loose quick money.
@_date: 2013-12-07 19:32:09
I can do it for you. I have verified paypal. Can show proof that I own it etc. 
@_date: 2013-11-26 22:07:50
Ya. Saw it later. Sorry about that.
@_date: 2013-11-19 11:30:19
Thank you. 
@_date: 2013-11-26 21:59:31
Yes, I agree. I just wanted for people who are new in all this and do not have hell lots of Bitcoins learn. Atleast dont repeat mistakes. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 19:23:07
Not really good solution though. As its tough to trade or something. And they do not support some coins which I use. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 19:27:43
Aww. That is sad bro. I hope you get it some how. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 14:28:27
Aww. Sorry to hear that.
@_date: 2013-11-26 22:06:35
I saw the comments on his Tweets and I found out people asking How to SIGN UP indeed.
@_date: 2013-12-05 15:45:53
Ya I saw it. 
@_date: 2013-11-26 21:57:54
I lost yes. But Shouldn't happen to others. I mean all of us aren't so good. Its really sad the people who lost. Atleast it shouldn't repeat. That is what I want.
