Well, just to clarify, if I sell off my .0705 BCH, it *will not* affect the BTC that I have still sitting in my wallet will it? Also, at this point, I would be recording it as a loss wouldn't I? Specifically the tax loss from 126-31 x whatever my tax rate is.

OOOOOH. Ok looking back through my transactions I see that I had .070492 btc (in coinbase) on august 1st when the fork happened, I subsequently sent that out to my offline wallet a few weeks later due to a general nervousness about holding any significant portion of my crypto in an online exchange. On Dec 14th, coinbase credited me .0705 BCH, so it looks like I've already got the corresponding BCH.

Yea, I should probably do that. I could transfer everything to gdax and withdraw if there's still no fee for personal wallet withdrawals

I'm a little confused because you say I "need" to split them, and the other person said I can leave it or not :/.

If I were to fork what I have, I would end up with less btc right, I'm assuming at whatever exchange rate the fork happened at?

So considering I held something like 69 mbtc pre-fork, I might as well figure out a way retrieve my BCH because otherwise I'm *effectively* throwing away free crypto

OH I'm sorry you're totally right, that's really dumb of me to think about it the other way, it's not like I paid for it

My BCH is sitting in my coinbase account right now because that's where my BTC *was* at the time of the fork

I suppose the time is now after the crash? Idk if I'm buying into the heresy thing though, I thought that logistically speaking, BCH is supposed to be an improvement. I know BTC is the big daddy of crypto and all, but considering how lazy I've been about getting any alt coins maybe I should at least have a slightly more diverse crypto portfolio?

Wait a sec. So if, for example, I bought my btc on coinbase back in early 2017, and then moved it to an offline wallet like ethereum, the corresponding bch *should* show up on coinbase
@_date: 2018-01-19 16:24:33
Oh, okay. I dunno why, but in my mind it was going to happen something like this:  Prefork: 1BTC, and then after the fork I would have .5 BTC and .5btc worth of bitcoin cash, but I guess that's not the case. So why were people freaking out about the fork then? Were they just worried that the fork would cause the value of the BTC to plummet?

Wait a sec. So if I, for example, sell off the BCH that I aquired in the fork, that *will* affect the btc I have in my offline wallet? The reason I ask this is that your comment makes it sound like the two are related.
