I doubt that. Nobody knows for sure what happens after we die. Maybe we are reborn in the future, maybe in the past. Maybe we vanish, we get erased. Have you considered that it is possible that we might ascend to a superior life form ? Who knows...

Why stress for it ? Part of human life, mate. Ride the wave and do not let the wave ride you. Blaze it sane. Good day.

You are already experiencing 4th dimension which is space time but you do not have the knowledge to comprehend it mentally nor see it. Think of 4th dimension as a psychical realm rather than a psyhical realm like 3rd dimension is.

Mycelium, man. Fuck, confirmation in 3 hours, most of the time less than that. I usually get a confirmation from othe wallet that the transaction it's received but needs transaction. At that point no one to piss a shit sonny cause papa has patience. For 200£, that's 1£ confirmation fee. Fuck, there are atm's that charge that much or more for a withdrawal. Sometimes we can't lower fees ( see purchases that have a fixed fee ), we suck it up because we chose to use bitcoin and not fiat. Fuck those times but that's it. Gotta go hard or gotta go home.

Bring the historian.

Well if you use an exchange that has transaction fees that high is probably because their comission is in terms of % not $$. Meaning that the higher the value of the bitcoin the higher the value of fees. If you transfer from a wallet to a wallet get one that can chose the tx fee. I sent 5000£ with a fee of 10£

You are a fooken Bitcoin millionaire, who cares about USA ? Retire to a country where Bitcoin is not banned. Think smart.
@_date: 2017-11-15 22:55:08
That is a bit of a exaggeration but not impossible. In our lifespan will be more like fiat but between consumers and stores that accept or function only on bitcoin. Something along these lines.

It's £250 but in a shared room ( me &amp;  someone else ) . Single rooms go from £400 in outer London, in central London...Let's stop there.

Prime example of why you shouldn t use exchanges to manage (receive, send and hold) your bitcoins.

Why do we care, we'll shot transactions via our blockchain satelite. We won't need internet for that, right, guys ?
