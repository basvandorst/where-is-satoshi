That's cause you're dumb.

1. Who cares, customers have zero reasons to use bitcoin.    
2. Never gonna happen, shitcoin is too volatile (due to being sustained by a pyramid of foolishness and greed).    
3. Bitcoin sucks for micro transactions, because the blockchain architecture is extremely inefficient (as any developer with half a brain will tell you).    
4. I'm sure regulators will see that and not ban bitcoin altogether...    
5. What adoption? No one uses this shitcoin for anything except hoarding and trying to convince other fools to "buy in" so they can "cash out".    
6. You know zero about politics, finance and technology.    
Conclusion: just like all your fellow bitcoiners, you are a dumb idiot.

Bitcoin is like a game of hot potato. It's burning your fingers now, so you need to find a greater fool to dump it to.

You are dumb.

I'm sure a couple of youtube videos of a few neckbeards paying with bitcoin will make shitcoin happen. Don't forget the fedoras, guys!    
PS. You are an idiot.

Oh I'm sure the dudes at the top of the pyramid exchanging their virtual tokens for real money to idiots like you are crying all the way to the bank. It's good to see you take pride in being the greater fool, maybe you won't jump off a building when this turd collapses.    
PS. In case no one told you before, you are a certified grade A retard.

You can't see it cause you're a blind fool.

European here. You are an idiot.

Stay off the pipe, you delusional fool.    
PS. You are a gullible broke idiot, and always will be.
