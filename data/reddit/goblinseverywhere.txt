Misappropriation of funds relies on the permanently depriving part.
So its possible that this is in response to other potential charges.
But hey, reddit is full of lawyers.
@_date: 2015-02-11 10:47:55
Thank you...
You only have to work with general public in tech support for a couple weeks to see that a LOT of people struggle to check email, download attachments, google for their own help and even turn the unit completely off, a lot of people sleep it or just close the lid and think its turned off completely.
People on reddit are alreadly pretty much automatically in the top 50% of technically literate people.
The fact OP said


Probably puts him in the top 25% without even trying. 
Yet he considers himself dumbest of the dumb... wtf...
How blind can OP be to think hes even an -average- user let alone the dumbest.
I had to show someone 4 times how to sign out and sign into a different account on 8.1. 4 times. I was going very slow and doing it step by step and its like 3 clicks.
Another guy came in with a complaint that when he put DVDs in it didn't auto play and he literally had no idea how to manually open the player or fix that problem. He had ZERO clue.
ANYONE who agrees with OP in this has clearly had zero reference with general public. 
@_date: 2015-02-11 10:50:07
Years of tech support work? 
I'd say 50%+ wouldn't know how to begin resolving any issue if something went wrong in any way.
People rely on their friends, kids, coworkers, IT etc etc for basic things constantly.
The fact you're on reddit puts you in the top 50% for tech literacy for sure. I've tried to introduce a parent to reddit before, it was an absolutely nightmare. 
Those are average users. The majority don't care to know how to fix computer issues and the majority don't even want to try.

I specifically recall being on a bitcoin minecraft server before that had a ton of games in it you could bet on.
It was over a year ago... 
I specifically remember a big arena with a glass floor looking down on a 4-5 lane track where they'd race... zombies I think.
Is this a new server or is it that one?
Because if its new, the idea definitely isn't new.
@_date: 2015-02-16 05:34:45
Your argument works if they had fuck all sales entirely but not given they did a ton of USD work.
@_date: 2015-02-11 12:04:25


Thats what I mean.
I also accepted it is improving, I think rapidly is more down to definition than anything else but it is definitely improving.

This is good for Bitcoin
@_date: 2015-02-11 11:19:21
Because, as you say,  the use of those devices have become easier over time.
This is the exact reason consoles were huge and still are pretty damn big, they're super easy to use. Its plug and play.
Windows 8 came out, do you have any idea how insane the influx of "WTF HOW DO I DO ANYTHING" to any branch of tech support was? It was massive.
People were paying for a brand new laptop/desktop and THEN a copy of windows 7 just to install over it because $100 was easier than learning how to use it.
So far bitcoin hasn't really become easier in a way a general user needs it to be.
Frequently storages suddenly go off the radar because of some huge fraud or shit and that removes any comparison to the stability that banks offer by comparison.
I can't swipe a card at the grocery store and then walk out the door for bitcoin. 
But this is now just getting into the whole problems people have adopting digital currencies. 
For the record, if it changes things, I -HAD- bitcoin/dogecoin/litecoin/feathercoin annnnnd one i'm forgetting but currently don't anymore as it was becoming a lot of work to just keep track of current prices by comparison of a currency that pays my rent.
It is all about simplicity and others adopting... its slow but I think it might get there.
But stating right now that its simple and easy and anyone can do it is just completely completely false. 
edit: Overall we pretty much agree?

How would I back up my wallet and/or keep it secure?
@_date: 2013-04-09 17:33:34
Yeah and if you saw the chart like a week before it you'd see it wasn't actually 50%. It was just a tiny timeframe where they solved a succession of blocks luckily in a way that, for that very short amount of time, you could say they had 50% share.
When in actual fact they probably haven't grown/shrunk in any significant way at all its just this is a chart for no and the one before was just lucky.
Which got explained in EVERY SINGLE THREAD ABOUT THIS.
@_date: 2013-03-31 16:32:23
I have a minor understanding of bitcoins so far but from what I know it looks like they're gone from where they were...
That really sucks... Can anyone here explain why that happened and how people should avoid it?
@_date: 2013-04-01 13:52:48
I might be wrong but can't you just pay from one to the other?
@_date: 2013-04-09 11:33:23


But thats what possible is... its not impossible so its possible.
I've always compared it to looking for a needle in a giant haystack. The more "power" you have the more people are looking. Theres always a needle in there but it takes ages. Sometimes you get super lucky with the pool or people and find the needle in just a minute or so.
But the concept is that with just a single person (or tiny amount of power) you could find the needle just lying ontop of the first haystack you look in.
While I understand its insanely lucky if it happened I don't think its comparable to what you're suggesting. You're suggesting impossible things but then contradicting yourself with "Its not possible, but it is" stuff.
It is possible, that was my question. I understand its insanely implausible but no matter how insanely implausible it is... unless its impossible its possible.
@_date: 2013-03-31 11:56:31
I can happily accept them making it a "safe" % above whatever it is right now. I'll pay a little extra if places accept it in exchange.
But jesus, thats just way too much... probably setup once and never changed
@_date: 2013-03-30 04:12:26
Thats great to hear, i'm not in specific rush at all i'm just looking to get my feet wet.
Thanks for your help! If I could tip you I would!
Congrats on your £1000 worth :)
I really am looking to buy in 0.1BTC sort of levels right now. I just don't have a real need for bitcoins apart from being interested right now.
@_date: 2015-02-11 14:39:21
I've worked as support within a small business, within a medium sized business and as a public facing walk-in style business.
I've also interacted with a ton of people WAY WAY WAY smarter than me in every single area when it comes to ANYTHING technical. Like, I was an ant to them.
I'm good friends with a variety of professional programmers as well as people who wouldn't know which way round to hold a laptop.
I'm speaking about the large amount of people that are NOT capable and i'm drawing on my experience in tech support specifically as thats the area where I've found it to be such a large amount.
Given i'm not drawing my opinion on JUST that selection of people then its perfectly acceptable to say i've come across them, they're PART of my conclusion.
I am completely aware that would be biased. You should be aware i'm not just thinking of those people otherwise i'd be saying 99% of people are wildly inept and questioning how the world even developed with tech.
@_date: 2013-03-31 16:36:42
You're right in the sense that its only a bad thing for a seller to do it. The buyer is protected pretty damn well from it.
@_date: 2013-03-31 17:13:04
It just takes time and research. Learn what common terms are and how X works or why Y happens the way it does etc.
Its definately no pick-up-and-go thing yet but neither is regular banking. Its just people are not using bitcoins and surrounded by BTC from the day you're born to today. If you had 20 years of everyone using bitcoins you'd know everything there is about them.
Personally I don't understand the vast majority of investment accounts and other banking shenanigans and I -have- had those all my life.
@_date: 2013-04-01 19:13:56
I can confirm the same. There is a fee setting for mine under the preferences. I've never seen it without one.
@_date: 2013-03-30 05:26:05

Thank you for your ideas. I will ponder on that.

12 dollars is at least 2 coffees too much.
I'd pay a buck or two over maybe. $3 coffee? I'd pay $5 in BTC if I could.
@_date: 2013-03-31 15:20:21
Thank you very much. I appreciate the answer. Lot to learn recently
@_date: 2013-03-31 17:09:40
You're lucky to find one giving out 0.001BTC now. I know i've seen 0.00001btc ones around. Tiny tiny amounts. 
Still, its something! Everything i've been earning i've been basically giving it out to other people to get them interested in it too.
I've heard lots of stories about people spending lots of bitcoins on basic things back when they were worth like... $2 each. 
People who are now kicking themselves over it. It happens.
Sorry you lost your wallet.
@_date: 2013-03-31 17:44:51


By the sender, not the guy who hasn't even received it.


Again, sender has broken the law so far. Recipient hasn't even received it yet so you can't say he has.
Please, whats your address, i'm going to send you 0.1g of weed and you're going to be arrested/computer seized. Right?
edit: Scratch that, i'm going to send it to the PM. Then he'll get arrested and his stuff seized! 
And the pope too, i'll send him some. I'll put his name on it too so they know its definitely his.
@_date: 2013-03-31 15:41:37
Wow, thank you very much for explaining it in that way. The "blockchain" makes a hell of a lot more sense since they're actually related to eachother via the hash of the previous.
I'd tip you if I had anything to spare right now. I'm almost completely out from handing out everything i've been given so far (plus a couple $ on satoshi dice). 
Thank you very much, if I get anything in the near future I will tip you. 
Your explanation is highly valued. 
@_date: 2013-03-30 03:36:38
Only 2 sellers active right now at £80/BTC and the minimum is 1BTC :P its a bit above what i'm looking for I suppose.
Thank you for the link.
@_date: 2013-03-28 13:09:38
Thank you! I will look into that.
@_date: 2013-04-08 20:21:30
Sure but it reads a lot more like "Why not just pay off the entire mortgage instead of holding onto them?"
Not that unbelieveable that someone might have 3,000BTC from way back when which would now be worth (at $170 lets say) $510,000 or something around there.
I've seen a bunch of people who have recently (past month) gone "Holy shit I have 500btc from -ages- ago" or something.
Its just how I read it I suppose, along with the big price explosion thats happened.
@_date: 2013-03-30 05:47:14
Not that you'd be interested but I have a m11x for sale (underpowered "netbook" from alienware) which would be much cheaper. I'd take bitcoins too. 
Reading in these comments however I see you're looking for a much more powerful machine and the only thing it fits is portability with a little umph for games.
Good luck!
@_date: 2013-03-30 03:15:13
Free bitcoins? Yeah, i've been doing those. Specifically the site visiting. Its a very very slow income though. "0.00442328 BTC" is my balance after playing with those for some good time. Barely anything. Pennies.
I'm looking to have like £5 before I can call myself a participant. Free little bits here and there are cool. Thank you for the blog. Just looking to flat out purchase though.
@_date: 2013-03-28 13:27:37
I always did it during times I was making $0/hour. Slap a movie on and just got to it. Didn't earn much but I wasn't earning 20c a day or something. It gave me enough to get a couple little extra for myself here and there.
Also, my GPU isn't exactly super powered BUT I do not pay for electricity at the moment. Also have a GPU about to be replaced. Just seems a bit of an ideal situation to do a bit of mining to earn some extra pennies here or there.
@_date: 2013-03-30 06:23:03
Yeah, it seems like the vast majority of websites that you can buy from are certainly USA only and the such. 
It certainly doesn't help i'm only looking for small amounts. Thats my main issue it seems. 
I use bitcoin-qr (I think thats its name) as my wallet right now. Seems very simple to use and it was on so many of the "get started" style blogs. I've got it "encrypted" too which I figure must help as I have to put in my long as hell password eachtime I do anything with it.
When buying small amounts the fees are killer for me. I think I might just have to save up a bit and buy a couple full BTC. 
@_date: 2013-04-02 09:59:25
Best case scenario is that he already has them anyway and doesn't pay electricity. In that case its a pretty good amount for a broke person :P
@_date: 2013-04-01 13:59:34
just keeps hitting that sell wall at 99.99. 
@_date: 2013-03-29 05:52:14
What a selfless way of getting others interested. I have to say its a little demotivational to look at my wallet and see its empty. Almost feels pointless using it like having an empty bank account.
If I have 1 BTC to give to you for your selfless deeds I would.
Good for you.
@_date: 2013-03-31 15:10:43
Open source = awesome. Thanks for that. It should stop the vast majority of people thinking you're going to rob them blind.
@_date: 2013-03-28 12:56:27
I certainly could! Theres a decent amount of places that accept them too.
@_date: 2013-03-31 06:35:45
I have very little anyway but is bitcoin-qr wallet with encryption enough? Should I be doing more? 
@_date: 2013-03-31 19:48:59
Show me an instance of it happening in the UK and i'll give -some- weight to it but as someone growing up with a heavy legal parental background I can say it really doesn't.
I can say that when it does they get the shit sued out of them and -hard-.
A package arriving for someone doesn't, in anyway, make someone arrestable OR give ANY cause for a warrant UNLESS you can prove they specifically ordered whatever is in there.
A package showing up DOES NOT give enough for a warrant OR arrest OR seizure of ANYTHING but the package.
You learn this 101 shit from border patrol programs. It just doesn't happen because its a huge waste of police AND court time.
Its not enough evidence and they KNOW that. 
They'd sieze the package, question the potential recipient, he'd deny any knowledge of it and it'd be left at that.
The only way they could get him is if he opened the door to them while -doing- drugs right there.
If he didn't answer the door they'd have zero right to enter the property and zero ability to get a warrant based upon a package arriving. 
@_date: 2013-03-31 19:51:14
I figured, sorry if I did but it wasn't intentional whatsoever.
Shit happens, I -can- see how it would but I guess I still view it as easier to read friendly but thats very biased as I wrote it so I might just be being blind.
I'm 100% for learning and asking as many questions as needed in this community. Its how i'm learning and its how people should learn. 
I've only been actively learning about bitcoins for like.. a month. I knew of them before but very little.
Oh well. Tone is a bitch sometimes.
@_date: 2013-04-09 00:33:13
Oh absolutely, I figured its like lottery style luck but its more a "Technically it works that way... so you could get super lucky"
Thank you for the answer. I'm learning :D I'd tip you something if I had anything left... I keep giving out what very little I get to people in order to get them interested. I figure if I get 1/5 people I give 0.01BTC to be interested then its a success.
Sincere thank you is all I can offer right now.
@_date: 2013-04-01 19:14:45
Is LTC basically just the same as BTC but seperate?
I don't get it... is it just a competitor trying to do the same thing?
@_date: 2013-04-09 00:35:06
But possible I hear. I have no intention of doing it whatsoever but thought about it the other day and its a "technically it could..." idea.
As I said to another answer here, thank you for your response.
I'd tip you if I could but I give out the very little I get to people who haven't heard of bitcoin at all. I figure 0.01btc amounts works well enough to entice people to at least look it up and see what its about and how it works.
Thank you.
@_date: 2013-03-30 05:42:46
Well again, thank you. I know my interest in obtaining them creates just a tiny bit more demand and thus, prices go up. So yeah thats a tiny win for all already invested.
It just seems like I need to do more research and find a couple reliable sites that sell the amounts i'd want.
Get all setup and everything.
Thank you again, genuinely made my day. Especially since i'm pretty poor most of the time. 
@_date: 2013-04-01 14:00:17
its hit 99.99 a good few times now... its just hitting a pile of sell orders
@_date: 2013-04-15 23:00:48
Yeah, the same as just adding recipients in bitcoin-qr wallet right? When you go to send money?
@_date: 2013-03-28 12:57:22
Also! What is a bitcoin worth? How much/frequently/crazily does it change? 
Where can I easily buy/sell them for actual money? Is there a method for that or is it purely person to person and once you have a coin its never reverted?
I have a network from my office that I could utilize for CPU farming. Is this, whatsoever, profitable if you ignore electricity/startup costs?
@_date: 2013-03-31 17:07:29


No they don't. Thats not legally proving anything. I don't believe its even probably cause in the UK because theres absolutely no proof whatsoever that your household is in on it.
Otherwise people would send tiny amounts of drugs to people they hate and tip off the police all the time.
They would have no legal reason to believe you paid with bitcoins either so no ability to check that. 
I can assure you that police on a small drug seizure need help logging into windows sometimes. Let alone the chance of one of them understanding bitcoins AND having a reason to check.
Also, even if they did check, how would they see what you used BTC for? Unless they specifically know the recipient of the transaction too.
Man, so many huge legal variables and gaps in that. It would never happen.
@_date: 2013-03-30 05:24:56
Holy crap, thank you so much. I didn't expect to be just given... well, free money... let alone so much. Thank you.
I will return the favour at some point. I promise that.
@_date: 2013-03-31 06:34:00
 I sent a handful of people $1~ amounts to get them interested and then spend $2~ on that satoshi dice thing.. I think thats the name. That was fun!
I was going to get gold but it would of stopped me gambling/handing them out.
@_date: 2013-03-31 16:04:15
Isn't that basically like saying "they can be traced if you tell people all the details".
If you try to be anon whatsoever its actually impossible to find out who you are I thought?
@_date: 2013-03-30 03:30:31
Interesting. Thats quite different from what i've been hearing. I've heard that 0.01BTC or upwards of that is possible but you pay the top rate. Buying more than 1BTC usually started yielding discounts.
Maybe i'm reading it wrong. Thanks for the link
@_date: 2013-03-30 03:13:28
I'm afraid I can't seem to understand this service, it lets me -receive- via paypal but not pay? I don't understand the vouchers either?

@_date: 2013-03-31 15:14:13
Thank you! I always figured 1 was enough. I've had 6/6 take ages before and didn't think people would wait for that.
I've actually enjoyed the idea of having a chat while waiting for confirmation. Nice to meet people and it kinda forces that.

20 random letters and numbers. Well, technically a combination of 3 words with  various numbers within. 
No key loggers, no viruses etc etc
If I had any significant amount ($100+ even, I don't have much so thats significant to me) then i'd look into other options but I figured i'd ask incase I was using a crappy program thinking I was secure when it was super easy to take.
@_date: 2013-03-31 19:41:09
well i'm saying I also don't understand but to not be put off by it.
That when you do understand it can seem daunting.
I was expanding on how it sucks to not understand something but how, with bitcoins, it seems to just take time.
I wasn't, in anyway, pushing him away. I was actually trying to make it seem less daunting.
@_date: 2013-04-09 00:08:38
Some of them might held onto a few maybe but I doubt its like they have just tons sitting around. A handful here or there just like everyone else.
@_date: 2013-03-31 15:09:13
I got tipped 0.1BTC from a very generous person here. I used the majority of that to hand out 0.01BTC portions to other people to get them interested!
@_date: 2013-03-31 17:27:54
Thats kinda just... begging, which is against the rules here.
Not like i'm rolling in it either, i'm in the same situation as you financially. I spent all mine gifting them to other people with little speeches to why they should at least look into it.
Don't beg, go do something for them. Draw pictures for people, offer any services you could offer, sell some shit you have laying around for BTC. Start mining even if you have the ability to and don't pay for electricity or something.
Beggings bad yo.

Why would you need to proxy the wallet software?
@_date: 2013-03-31 14:46:23
Thats an awesome story. 
Newbie question, sorryif i'm stupid for not knowing but how do you confirm the payment? In bitcoin-qr it has the "confirmations x out of 6" thing. Is 1 out of 6 confirming it or do you have to wait for 6 out of 6 to know its 100% your/their money now?
@_date: 2013-04-09 14:03:57
Please do explain how quantum mechanics would allow that if you can?

Post hoc is awesome, my favourite term to use too.
Completely post hoc here. Good use.
In actuality, in every thread about the "50%" people poited out they actually were just very lucky for a short amount of time and that a week or so before they were 35%~. All thats happened is that they haven't continued to be super lucky and its gone back to 35%.

but you keep using examples that are not possible to describe something that is... 
If its possible its possible. A frog jumping over the Sears Tower is not possible. Its not a cause of probability with that happening.
With solving a block it entirely is.
@_date: 2013-03-31 17:33:40
Can't get a warrant based upon that situation. 


Probably cause. They need probable cause.
You're jumping the gun with the warrant. They can't get a warrant from a package being sent to you. Otherwise i'll send packages to tons of people I hate and they'll get, according to you, arrested, computer siezed etc. For what? Having something sent to them?
@_date: 2013-03-29 06:03:33
