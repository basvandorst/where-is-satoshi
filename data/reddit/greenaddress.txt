@_date: 2014-03-03 00:28:53
I'm afraid jerseykx is at sleep but I can try to answer.
1)The advantage with our system is that we can guarantee things such as limits, doublespends and greenaddress instant confirmation as we are a useful and necessary step in freeing funds.
We also allow people to give out urls and receive funds each one in a different address of the user HD wallet.
In order to solve the issue of our company disappearing we intend to provide a transaction presigned by both GreenAddress.It and the user with [nLocktime]( such that eventually the user will be able to get back the funds in a user defined amount of time and address. This still allows us to offer the extra guarantees and every time the nlocktime transaction expire the funds will require to be moved in order to gain those guarantees again.
We believe Bitcoin is going to grow fast and large and that security is quite important and we love to give back to the community. 
2) We believe there is a category of premium services that we can provide and our aim is to provide as best as service as we can. In case we should ever shut down a group of people will release the keys but even if not the nlocktime presigned transaction should be enough to sleep safely.
This means that all our services are currently free and we intend to build more services, for instance around colored coins that are premium services.
EDIT: Any more question feel free!

I left a tech lead role in Finance to start a Bitcoin startup for a small Bitcoin multisig hybrid wallet because I wanted to provide a wallet available everywhere (both web and app) with stronger security while making it available to less expert people.
I now work with this great [developer](
@_date: 2014-03-04 20:58:42
You can check with wireshark or some other network analysis tool.
You can also write your own WebSocket client such that you never have to run any of our JS code.
You can also use our Android hybrid app, although at the moment we only have native crypto and nfc/qrcode scanner meaning that it still run a web app to control it.
The mnemonic is very important to keep safe but even if that is stolen you are still protected by the two factor.
Obviously this isn't true if it was us having your mnemonic so for your safety of mind we are  looking to open source our client and to built an electrum plugin.

We are actually adding it soon, just wanted the first implementation to be quite basic and explicit.
Thank you!
Have you tried Gentle?
@_date: 2014-03-03 10:08:06
Unlike other systems our implementation allows users to login in watch-only mode, meaning that their private keys are not in the browser at all.
 We also have an android app, which while hybrid at the moment, can be modified to run static code not allowing a server to steal your keys (minus blatant bugs) (i.e. don't run dynamic JS from the server).
We're also looking into an electrum plugin.
However we do agree that if someone comprimises our systems and injects some JS in user browsers which have loaded their mnemonic then that user could be attacked.
On the other hand, it is not enough to inject some JS on our page as two factor will prevent any spend attempt, you also have to comprimise our backend and vault.
What do you think?

Very interesting concept!!
We have been working on a different Multisig wallet here at [GreenAddress.it]( .
We still have some features we're working on but the wallet functionality is quite stable.
We have:
 * P2SH 2 of 2
 * BIP0032 Electrum like HD wallet
 * Payment URLS
 * Google two factor, sms two factor, email two factor
 * email, facebook, sms payments
 * Watch-Only mode
 * Android app with QRcode scanner and NFC support (so far just for login)
 * GreenAddress instant confirmation
 * to be implemented: limits that don't require 2 factor (i.e. for coffee), delays (like gmail, to make sure you can cancel an outgoing email if you get something wrong)
 * etc
Feel free to provide early feedback!
You can try our [Testnet]( if you like too :) and don't forget to send the coins back to a faucet when you are done!
@_date: 2014-03-16 04:11:24
We do plan to implement 2 of 3 for some features  :)
We think 2 of 3 wallets are *less* secure for the majority of users as they will inevitably leave the keys together and there won't be any two factor helping there.
Also 2 of 2 allows to provide some extra features with the payment protocol.
@_date: 2014-03-04 16:45:01
Instant confirmation can be useful.
The problem is about trust, but here the money comes from a party and the trust from another which has one interest and mission: having people trust them to provide said service.
This also is the only way that allows us to really protect users.
With our 2 of 2, even if we get hacked the hacker won't have access to funds, and on the other hand, if the user has his mnemonic stolen or keylogged nobody will be able to steal the funds because of our two factor authentication.
The network propagation can help but it is not the only tool :)
@_date: 2014-03-03 00:46:28
Unfortunately yes but it can be automated on login and notified via email/sms/android push.
The one most important thing is that we can't run away with customers funds or have offline wallet password cracking which makes the design all much more secure.
@_date: 2014-03-04 21:58:28
We don't hold at any point in time the customer funds.
We just help them protect them.
At no time we can move the funds without the user deciding so, not even if forced by legal enforcement.
We just can't.

At this time we have set a default of 90 days or 12960 and a transaction fee has to be paid each time the period expires.
You can set the period to anything between 144+ blocks to a large int as it makes you feel more comfortable.
We are working on some changes that should allow us to not require to redeposit funds at expiry to use the service and spend the coins.
Those outputs that have expired won't have our guarantee of instant confirmation / double spending attempt because are in your control alone if you want via the nlocktime transaction.
We are looking to migrate (automatically for users) from our current multisig with your per transaction key and our fixed key to also use a different key for each transaction on our side too from an HD wallet.
We should then improve privacy as the transaction wouldn't be identifiable as coming from our key unless explicitly provided out of band as a service.
We are also implementing the payment protocol.

We think nlocktime is important for easy of mind.
All the other features are interesting but ultimately not necessary in order for you to trust your funds in GreenAddress.it
Personally I wouldn't have problems putting under 50$ in GreenAddress.it but for more I'd wait for nlocktime transactions.
@_date: 2014-03-07 17:20:23
I'm not sure where to start but i'm going to assume you know bitcoin and know about bitcoin wallets even though you've been a redditor for a minute.
So, GreenAddress.it is one of the new bitcoin multisig wallet, it has some different features from the others (for example it is deterministic and 2 of 2).
The way it works is that we protect one key for the two factor, but should we disappear for any reason then this tool will help you recover your funds.
Is this the level of ELI5 you wanted? I'm assuming you are a 5  years old bitcoiner :)
@_date: 2014-03-04 22:22:31
Oh I've seen them, one of the 3-4 Multisig wallets.
I'm not convinced by the design, in general I'm not convinced by the design of any 2 of 3 wallet.
2 keys will be held by the user and the vast majority will  inevitably put the key in the same place or lose it altogether.
Their design provides delays and yet with the two keys an attacker doesn't care two bits about their delays or their two factor.
And of course the same address ? all the time ? I don't want everyone to know what I'm doing with my bitcoin wallet.
Thoughts on this?
@_date: 2014-03-04 22:07:33
The user will be able to define the nlocktime expire time in settings, we will have some reasonable default, still up for finalization (maybe 3 months expiry or anyway some reasonable tradeoff).
Users will get notification via email or sms or android push when they want to re-secure funds into the 2 of 2 in advance and they can move them manually earlier at any time.
Upon login the system will show the user which 2  of 2 are about to expire in an nlocktime and allow the user to move the funds and recreate a new nlocktime automatically, one button away.
The old nlocktime will then reference outputs that have since moved and as such the presigned transaction will be worthless.
Nlocktime transaction should be available in around 10/15 days.
@_date: 2014-03-04 22:03:03
This is how [GreenAddress.it]( works more or less.
It uses 2 of 2 and then nlocktime to free the transaction, and the user key (HD seed) is never exposed to the server, not even in encrypted form.
We are discussing this over [here](

nothing is 100% secure.
We say is one of the most secure web wallet if not the most secure.
It is also one of the few offering HD wallets meaning your privacy is preserved when people are presented with an address of yours, they can't find all your past and future transaction history (unlike other web wallets).

You can't login in facebook unless you have already created an account and linked it.
The facebook login is so that you can login in watch only mode or automatically receive funds in your wallet from facebook contacts: only your public master key is held at GreenAddress and you can see your balance and transactions or receive new payments to a freshly backed address off your HD wallet - nothing else.
You should be able from the link to either get the private key so you can sweep it in your wallet of choice or create a new wallet on our service and automatically the funds will be swept .
Let me know if you have any feedback on the process or if you think we could make it smoother.

You shouldn't trust a service until it is more established and it has proven its worth!
That being said, we think we offer one of the best *web* wallet security and privacy:
* nlocktime recovery of transaction even if we disappear, for whatever reason, see [gentle]( a tool we have developed for this purpose
* two factor authentication PER transaction
* watch only mode
* hd wallet, so people can't just follow you on the blockchain on one address
And you can use our Android app with qrcode support and NFC.
If you don't trust our web client you should wait for our local open client as we are working on it.

Yes all deposits needs to be in 2 of 2 to offer our two factor protection and other features like greenaddress.

@_date: 2014-03-05 01:55:36






Would you agree that one double spend attempt is enough to detect such behaviour?
No we are not insured nor have any bond against damage nor we are looking to be in the short term.
We believe that if we are ever caught doing a double spend that it will rightly be the end of our service and users won't have to wait 30k before stopping to trust us, one is enough.
There is key reuse but even if we use BIP0032 for the greenaddress key we still have to provide our master public key for people to trust it's greenaddressness, i'm don't think it has any improvement on privacy. 
I think we can improve privacy by providing double spend protection out of band, by either the payment protocol, or just providing a signature out of band. 


You are perfectly right about this, there has been a mismatch between what should have been written and what has been written..
What we said was supposed to be about web wallets, or at least, in comparison/contrast to the available web wallet.
We never intended to arrogantly state we are the most secure wallet ever, just one of the most secure web wallet (and I understand this too is open for discussion).
We have improved a few of these concerns and we are glad they have been brought to our attention


We also have an hybrid Android app but by virtue of being hybrid it has some control by a browser (even though the crypto is native it is controlled by the JS)
We are looking into developing an electrum plugin or anyway plugin for native clients to improve the situation - one step at the time.
Thank you a lot for your feedback!

Hi, limits and delays have not been activated in prod yet.
Limits disable two factor under certain amounts (like 5$ a day, user selectable) so you can pay quick with qrcode or NFC.
Delays is for dumb moment when you get something wrong or for when a user is scared of someone else spending his funds and wants a last opportunity to stop the transaction.
Settings auto save (besides the settings that have not been enabled yet, that is)

This is a question that has been answered many times.
Depending on the use you want to have of such wallet and the platform you want to use it on (windows, mac, linux desktop, android, webby) you have different choices.
If you don't need to use the coins in the wallet then a paper wallet with backup copies in safe places is a good bet.
If you want to have a wallet you can use then armory is one of the most secure apparently, bitcoin-qt is the "standard".
I like a lot electrum. Apparently coming on android.
If you really want a web one there's blockchain.info which is one of the best.

For instance, most of batch 2 and 3 avalon have yet to make back the btc the asics costed in first place and I'm not sure people buying BFL will ever make the money back in mining equivalent to the btc amount they would have been able to buy should they have chosen to get btc instead.
If you have money you can afford to lose, why not investing 80% in btc and 20% in some mining company (not in some mining rig itself) ?

Some part of the website like escrow or apis are still in beta or development but the wallet is pretty full-featured and stable and so are the instant payments.
Discaimer: I work for greenaddress.it.
Any feedback highly welcome.
p.s. 
You can fool around on testnet too if you want (or tor for that matter, see FAQ) on testnet.greenaddress.it

And the best part is that nobody would even notice and this will be considered a crazy conspiracy theory.
