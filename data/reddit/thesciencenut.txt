I'm not trying to be a douche. I'd rather give the dogecoin directly, as it would avoid losing any towards exchange fees. I'd rather see my doge given to someone who needs it, not cryptsy.

I'll throw 2k Doge your way if your still doing it.

I suppose, I assumed he would be exchanging to USD with Cryptsy, in which case, it would be doubling the fees. 
I'm just trying to help here. Most of my funds are in Doge, not BTC. It's not that I don't love BTC, because I do. I just make more profit from mining Doge.

Is there an address where I can send Dogecoin? That's where most of my funds are currently.

2 weeks worth of earnings. It's all I have stockpiled now. 
Plus, I could switch my miner over to use clever mining and send all my BTC over for the rest of the month.
Edit: I just put a sell order into Cryptsy, It might take a bit of time (Cryptsy is slow) but it'll be swapped to BTC.

You could probably configure something like that for android, but it would be next to impossible for iOS due to the weird restrictions that apple has.

It seems silly to double up on fees though.

Does anyone have this lady's email?

I used to have an Iphone, but then I switched to android. 
I couldn't live with all the restrictions that they have.
