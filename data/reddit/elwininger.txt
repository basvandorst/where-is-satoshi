I guess it depends how much you have invested and how much you'd care if it was suddenly gone.

But btc is a rocket, blaow 
@_date: 2017-11-26 05:49:33
I can answer that. Currently, bitcoin and its core developers are trying hard to push other places to accept it. There has been rumors/speculation about amazon for some time now. However, for now, I can go to a site like bittrex or Coinbase, invest my money and withdraw it at a later time. For example, if I invested $5000 dollars in Coinbase around July when it was $2500 per bitcoin, I could now withdraw it into my bank account for around $18000.

My wife and I tried faucets over the summer break. She's excited because she earned a dollar that's now worth 4 haha

In its current state I think that's accurate. But that's not why I invest. I'm a long term holder. I know the goal, not the current state.

Because it exists as a currency. Why did someone spend 10,000 bitcoins to buy pizzas? 
@_date: 2017-11-26 06:50:40
Currently trading on Coinbase costs me about 200 bucks if I trade my whole btc amount. So if btc lowers to more than 2-300 dollars I can make a small profit which happens about every single day. So wtf are you talking about?
@_date: 2017-11-26 06:49:01
Nope just read your posts you've made, pretty simple.
@_date: 2017-11-26 06:27:51
You're right. But it can't exist as a currency until more buy into it. It won't be a currency until more see its worth. But slowly and surely, small businesses all the way up to corporations are starting to accept it as as currency.

I'm drunk. If you hate it that much, go back to your crypto shill subreddits you seem to be advertising for. All I originally said is that amazon has been a rumor constantly thrown around and that they are one of the few who have the capital to circumvent the high fees. Amazon most recently started purchasing crypto domains. Was that a ploy? Maybe. But also, maybe not.
@_date: 2017-11-26 06:47:21
You seem to be heavy eth. Not saying it's bad, you just have no posts to bitcoin.
Amazon purchasing domains does not mean amazon accepts bitcoin. Again, never said that, just said that it's been heavily rumored and that it's a step forward.

Sorry no, I sell btc when it's down several hundred, buy slightly more, and repeat. It's not that hard to understand.
@_date: 2017-11-26 06:22:57
Anyone, especially amazon, who doesn't need money in physical form since they hold such a high amount of cash on hand, that believes in the higher price in the future. That's like asking why I would day trade on Coinbase. Sure, it might cost me capital up front, but that's assuming the price stays where it's currently at. I don't know anyone who invests in bitcoin saying "yep, this is as high as it will ever go".
@_date: 2017-11-26 07:00:46
Fuck I am too drunk. I sell when it's on a downtrend, wait until it's went several hundred lower and then buy more. Any ways, point is whatever I'm doing seems to be working well for me and my original intent was to explain to people new to the process how they can purchase the coins and use them.
Hope you're portfolio is up.

Just so you know, good for you. My wife made like $3 doing faucets and she's happy with it and it taught her. Although next summer we both agreed to get jobs instead of doing faucets for bitcoin lol (we are teachers)

Lmao bravo sir
@_date: 2017-07-20 21:32:39
I think it's a great investment. I started getting into it from knowing nothing a few months ago. But like any investment, do your research first. I read about and believe in the direction bitcoin and cryptos in general are heading in, and it's a good idea if you do too.
