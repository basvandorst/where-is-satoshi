It seems like she got the joke even though errantmoon didn't!!

Yes... IRI is a piece of shit! why do you think we left!?? 
But one thing you need to understand is that These united states of America were the only country to use Atomic weapons on people!!!! If you don't see the irony you're blind!

@_date: 2014-02-14 22:20:26
Okay.. but what does that have to do with my question?
@_date: 2014-02-14 23:08:34
i thought since the price dropped, some may have stopped their rigs from running since it's less profitable and hence more chances for my box to get some ... maybe not. 
@_date: 2014-05-03 16:43:06

I was six years old! I just followed my mother. she moved here because my sisters are here. Why did they come here??To study. Both got their Ph.D. Why Did they come here? Cuz my uncles came here back in the early 70s. Why? to study!! one got his MBA and the other one got 2 Ph.Ds !! see the pattern??  


You watch way too much Hollywood and main stream media! you poor sap! 
it's like some European asking  an america living in Europe: "why did you leave america?!?! that place with cowboys and rednecks! I mean.. thats all of america right!??! cowboys and rednecks!! "   
You're so dumb, I can't even get mad at you! You are a product of your environment. 
I know you hate us brownies but you might wanna watch this...
@_date: 2014-03-12 05:02:00

@_date: 2014-03-12 03:55:31

"after even 2 shaves, it begans to dull. i can only get about 12 - 15 shaves vs.
no name K-mart lasting 35 shaves. and i wipe any moisture off the blades for both,
the no-name brand and the merkur despite the latter reads no need.
remember, the major cause of poor lasting edge is the rust u don't c.
the merkur blades r too expensive to boot! i won't buy it again. Warning:
K-mart had other no-name blades that didn't last either but this last one bought
about 4 months ago is still bood, blade after blade.
sei nicht kaufen das merkur blade!!!"""
