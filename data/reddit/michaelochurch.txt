So, here's the thing: air travel is or should be nearing peak usage. Trains ought to be killing planes on mid-distance travel, and clean nuclear energy can make 300mph overland travel environmentally sound. (We'd still need planes to hop continents, for another 50 years, until we can build VacTrains.) We're unlikely ever to have 10 times as many planes in the air as we have now.
Also, plenty of that travel is useless business travel. Bitcoin is not going to remake the corporate world. Humans are status-seeking primates and big-company CEOs are going to keep flying jets to beat their chests, in-person, in their colonies. 
Transportation eats a lot of fuel, but I don't see it eating 10 times as much in the next year. 
On the other hand, if Bitcoin succeeds, its power consumption will go up-- way up.

If Bitcoin becomes a serious currency, then the same people who own everything else will own it, in a matter of time, and nothing will really change.

Good luck.

I doubt it's much compared to other industries, but what makes you think bitcoin wouldn't have similar problems if it became a serious currency? Every week, you hear about someone losing bitcoins or an exchange getting pwninated.
Bitcoin has merely turned ASICs into another means of production. Big whoop. It's not changing the world. It's another speculative bubble. There've been hundreds of these, going back to Dutch tulip mania if not farther, and there will be hundreds more.
