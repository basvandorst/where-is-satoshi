Correction: blockchain potentially solves problems. It's not at all clear that BTC does or ever will. As of right now, BTC is purely a speculation vehicle and should be treated as such.
By the way, you should think more critically. When somebody makes a facetious comment about being a baghodler, it's often to make a point. In this case, it went totally over your head.

And what is the argument you're making? Do you know what the percentages are for BTC?
The Pareto principle isn't a law of nature. 80% of the wealth of the stock market today is held by the top 10%, not the top 20%. You can find many such examples in the world of finance, including significant variations between ownership concentrations of individual stock issues.

So Ferrari recalls the California (and 458 Italia) for two model years and suddenly it's a bad car? Have you driven or owned one?
I've owned a Diablo, Murcielago and Aventador SV. I'll speak to the latter since it's the newer of those and the one I owned most recently. It's a great track car, but unless you're at the track every weekend, it's not really a great car to drive off-track. There are a bunch of things that wear on you, such as the fact it's not comfortable to sit in and the transmission sucks. To be fair, the tranny in the Aventador S is supposedly better but frankly, if you're not out to impress people, the Huracan is a better option.
