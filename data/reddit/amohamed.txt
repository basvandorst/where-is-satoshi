Wow some of these responses really do clearly show the downside of too much group think which is prevelant in our community, a lot of these answers reminds me of school yard clicques  pointing at the new kid in school and each group telling eachother some rumor they heard about this kid. Instead of saying i heard ethereum is _______  I suggest we give it a chance and try and get to know it better before easily condeming it from hearsay

This seems one of the most useful uses of bitcoin, though at this moment, the biggest problem i see in this  is the liquidity of the 'local' part of the transfer many startups are trying to use bitcoin in this way but so far it feels very fragmented , some kind of cooperation between different startups and organizations who would like to use bitcoin in this way would be ideal. not sure in what capacity maybe in a decentralized SWIFT type organization would be great.
