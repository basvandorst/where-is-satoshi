Oh I see, do you really think BTC can truly exist in only a niche market though?
Personally I don’t think it can for long, peer to peer is a wonderful thing I know and I wouldn’t argue this.
But if opennode can bring BTC payments to the masses surely that’s good for BTC, of certainly for its price.
@_date: 2018-12-18 07:02:20
It’s both clearly, not many people own BTC which is fact.
And governments can laden what ever tax they choose, I think if you used your head you’d realise you can’t beat regulation and you will pay taxes or you’ll end up in jail.
Both of my statements are correct.

@_date: 2018-12-22 13:50:36
I completely agree, I think BTC can only grow with devs working on real world use case.
I’m sick of hearing about institutional investors and their trillions, these people are in it for control, whereas development and real world use case makes people believe again.
I do like Peter tiels view, and I would as a BTC owner love his price predictions to be correct, but if he’s willing to invest and push BTC forward I have to give him a pat on the back, because he does it for faith and not for greed.
@_date: 2018-12-21 11:53:19
Exactly how the fuck are you working that out, I think someone needs maths lessons.
Seriously ��.
I don’t think you know how supply and demand works.
It’s not 50$  divided  into 21 million BTC, and then multiplied say by 5 Billion people.
No no no no no, once supply is outstripped, and demand is high the price goes higher and higher, as long as you have demand outstripping supply it’s limitless increases.
So as I said originally if 5 billion people owned $50 worth each, way way way before 5 billion you’d see supply issues.
@_date: 2018-12-18 12:26:05
Tax it as much as they can I think, I’ve already addressed a letter to Congress and the IRS to alert them for the need to tax crypto purchases at source.
That mean no one will avoid the added taxes, meaning less and less people will use it and it will die.
It’s not a currency and people should stop calling it so, you will pay your taxes.
@_date: 2018-12-17 08:01:24
Store of value has to be more stable, at the moment NO, in the future maybe, unless BTC is dethroned and that is easily possible.
Well I don’t really care, I’m here for the money, I don’t buy into all the banker hate ect, I just want profit, and unless BTCs major sticking points aren’t remedied, then it may as well move over for another.
@_date: 2018-12-18 07:13:18

Very informative, complicated for a layman to understand but it makes things clearer.
What’s your view on BAKKTS impact in 2019, do you think they’ll have a positive impact, or do you see their arrival as overly hyped.
I also understand that none of these trading desks  have had regulatory permission yet to settle contracts in physical BTC, and rumours abound that is is because it would no doubt increase the BTC price dramatically, and therefore the authorities would rather keep a tight lid on it for now.
What are your views?
Where do you see BTC price going in 2019?.
@_date: 2018-12-22 08:38:41
I have a dumb ass question.

Masses of liquidity would need to enter the market for this to happen, estimates of around $280 thousand per BTC before any stability would be seen.

Tom Lee has predicted the BTC price with numerous others to disastrous effect, since Bitcoins  birth.
You cannot predict a future price for Bitcoin and any real analyst wouldn’t place their reputation on the line by doing so.
BTC is a speculative asset firstly so it’s price could be anywhere off that, it doesn’t produce anything so real value isn’t existent in that respect.
Without speculation the only value must come from supply and demand and “TOM LEE” should know that only works one of three ways.
1) the demand for the product outstrips the known supply that then= price high.
2) the supply is higher than the known demand which would signal= price low.
3) “EQUILIBRIUM”, this is where supply is eaten up by the same amount of demand and this= a level price nor up or down.
All in all predicting BTCs price is a fool errand and LEEs a fool.
Like all these people who own crystal balls they make these predictions because they are pumping their product, remember supply and demand, “VESTED INTEREST”.
Since xmas 2017 the BTC demand has been steadily dropping as people clearly have sold out, the price hasn’t found “EQUILIBRIUM”, far from it, as it has had a mass sell off and plenty of manipulation along with those sales.
All the above mean adoption and demand is way down,down,down since those days prior and you can see this in the low price, remember HIGH DEMAND and A LOW SUPPLY= price high.
Also in markets people always believe a tanking market is a good time to buy, and in most cases it can be, but be careful with BTC because the price is showing public sentiment towards the product and as of now they are not buying it.
That could be a sign that it may lose confidence and fizzle out.
Believe only tradition methods of price prediction as they are the ones which can make or break you.
Oh and just by chance Tom Lee again predicting.
Using wallets as a guide is ridiculous as some people have many wallets, that can’t be individuals, the guys a fool.
@_date: 2018-12-13 20:43:13
Tom Lee, is probably the worst person ever to predict BTC prices, he’s predicted so many random prices no human being should listen to the waffling of a mad man.
Facts are all this price prediction stuff is pure fantasy.
The price is what it is, live one day at a time.

They are just links to Bitcoins scams, they’re not what I asked you to produce because there is no “set in stone law”, about bitcoin sales.
Finland hey, I can’t speak for Finland, I know most places it’s not recognised as a legitimate means of payment so I think like most others there is more backing with traditional cards and banks.

Lightening hasn’t and won’t work, for a glaringly obvious reason.
Technically it may, in a kind of centralised way.
But because Bitcoin isn’t classed as a currency, all transactions are liable to TAX, meaning it’s not worth using over real fiat currency that’s not taxable.
People are not going to pay tax on purchases or services.
So lightening won’t compete.

@_date: 2018-12-15 14:50:20
Pretty much true in every respect.
It’s certainly clear many people are and have been brainwashed by BTC, it’s not difficult to achieve really, even highly intelligent people are susceptible.
Ignoring Bitcoins blaring flaws is a classic symptom, and also denying that a low price doesn’t spell “SELL OFF”is another.
And the author is correct, people are getting tired of hearing what Bitcoin will be able to do in time, all this is and means is an admission that it has problems.
So as for price apart from what one another are willing to pay for it, it is hard to truly give it real value compared to more traditional forms of investments.
There is no doubt the price is going lower and the sell off isn’t over, i personally think BTC is probably worth around a $1000 dollars, and I expect it may end down there.
And will BTC reign, “NO WAY”, others are being worked on now from scratch with the aim of sorting all these problems from day one, BTC was the first, it will not be the winner, I think that is a sure certainty.
@_date: 2018-12-16 11:10:32
You’ve put over an interesting opinion and you are very close IMO to being correct.
But the biggest problem with your analogy is like this other guy has, said, where would they get the equipment without eyes being raised, and warning signs going out.
All though I agree completely that market confidence is tantamount for a successful system, and no doubt the price would crash to Zero, I think it would be hard to pull off.
Not impossible though, depending how hell bent they were.
My take on BTC is far more simplistic, they are already in control through financial institutions, who can manipulate prices at a whim.
Also regulation is a big hurdle for BTC, let’s face facts, for adoption to work it has to agree their terms and conditions.
So all in all a 51% attack isn’t needed, driving prices lower and making mining equipment and miners redundant is easier to deploy.
@_date: 2018-12-16 17:08:35
It’s irrelevant to the public though isn’t it, as they don’t understand.
Mission accomplished, as you’ve answered the penultimate question, that is they do effect confidence and adoption.

Why is it the best, there are many coins that do things better, even Litecoin confirms faster.
Yes I do know monetary policies in the real world, monetary isn’t a word I’d use for BTC as it’s not a currency, it’s an asset, if you don’t know the difference I can explain if you’d like.
What you should be saying is it’s the first so it ecosystem and mining capabilities, and therefore it’s hashing power is superior to other coins, there is a huge difference in your and my statements.
If you think BTC could never die or be over taken you are foolish, nothing in this world stays top forever and people are fickle, they soon move onto the next big thing.
The smart money moves with those changes as you’ll learn.

@_date: 2018-12-24 09:38:26
That’s not necessarily true what your thought pattern is, when you buy with BTC you pay the dollar price for that article.
Let’s say a plane ticket costing 1000 dollars, you the buyer only pay 1000 dollars at the point of sale.
Your confusing this issue but bringing in the old adage of what increases in value tomorrow you won’t spent today.
As with bitcoin you can gain and lose for sure, but with fiat currency you can’t gain, but for sure a year later you will have lost because of a set inflation rate, this inflation rate is set by the federal reserve.
Also the scenario of not spending today because it may be worth more tomorrow isn’t true either, if you take electrical goods after a period of 18 months they are nearly half the price they were when newly released. But we as consumers don’t wait 18 months to purchase the latest tech, no we buy because we deem the item more valuable that the currency in our pockets.
Spending bitcoin for me isn’t what I’d consider sensible yet, fiat is worth less in the long term so it should be spent before crypto, as crypto is always worth more because of its finite supply.
@_date: 2018-12-13 16:51:49
I have a question if bitcoin is decentralised, or truly so, how come the tech industry behind it and the money vehicles that are meant to make it spread, and also the exchanges that sell it or most of them, have to ask permission or get regulatory clearance.

Isn’t using Bitcoin for purchases a taxable event in the US, and probably elsewhere, so why would you use it over fiat.
I’ve just checked and it isn’t classed as currency, so all purchases are taxable and must go on your tax return.
Calling BTC a currency isn’t correct, and why would anyone pay more for a good or service than needed.
Fiat is a currency so no tax is due.
@_date: 2018-12-15 08:49:36

Firstly you pointed out that BTC is the best coin at doing the best stuff.
LTC was an example, that’s all.
No ones saying it’s better all round, just faster which is the point, just like zcash is more anonymous.
Your analogies are ridiculous “CARS and ROUND WHEELS, sorry but try and be an adult.
Look there are coins being worked up from the ground up, no one can say that anyone of these won’t dethrone BTC, your talking about layer solutions where some coins that are being worked upon don’t need those things, in other words they do it all on chain.
You’ll find this was satoshi’s original dream, not second and third layers.
And your here whys is pathetic, and shows you are brainwashed, I won’t even answer because anyone with any knowledge of markets and computer science know how would laugh as I am now��.

Limited supply ��, it used to have a limited supply just like gold, but just like gold paper owner contracts, BTC now has paper futures and many more coming.
Either way they inflate the BTC supply so this gold/BTC store of value, is pure bollocks now, no one expected fractional reserve Bitcoin, but it’s here now.
@_date: 2018-12-17 10:33:44
Best think like this, everyone thought because BTC was a limited supply that there were no ways it could be inflated.
Meaning who ever wanted in would have to by the asset and own it.
This isn’t true because a fractional reserve system can be lent to anything at all.
Clearly the authorities are not going to let the BTC price moon, for more reasons than you could poke a stick at so to speak.
And these are ways they can subdue or control prices.
Short selling put downwards pressure on BTC spot price, not long ago most were bragging that BTC can’t be shorted, now it’s constantly shorted.
If it goes anywhere near 10k again, sell and get out, it will go back down for sure, over and over.
@_date: 2018-12-17 05:39:53
Yes it would be cheaper, I think what a lot of people in BTC don’t realise is, if hash rate crumbles extremely low, the security will go.
At that point they could choose to mine any coin other than BTC which is better than BTC, they do exist except BTC was the one they choose, it has security but many short coming also.
@_date: 2018-12-21 07:21:57
I think it’s not a rival for any decentralised crypto token like BTC, and especially the security of the BTC open Blockchain.
It will be at best a form of digitalised payment token, basically for use on their platform, there are many questions.
1) what secures it?
2)how are the tokens created and are they limited, you can pretty much guarantee they won’t be.
3)You can definitely say it will be centralised because these companies are about control.
So I think it’s another way to enslave the already enslaved people who use its platform, just I think those kind of people can’t think for themselves.
Also I do not use “facecrook”, they harvest way to much data and I think their platform was never cool anyway.
@_date: 2018-12-14 09:46:44
More prediction ��‍♂️, can’t see institutional money making any difference if they’re not buying BTC direct and effecting supply.
As for the other statements about lighter regulation well, that’s not going to happen, because government want their control and won’t open the flood gates.

Be careful there, watch your butt.
@_date: 2018-12-15 09:06:40
Well there you go, you agree.
Well futures are bad for BTC holders because they give all traders the opportunity to short the fuck out of BTC, hedging those bets with futures contracts.
If you think the BTC price doesn’t matter
think again, if they suppress the price and there is no movement higher, people will leave, sell off, look for the next thing.
The lower the price goes, usually the faster they exit.
Price high is what spurs FOMO, not price low.
And bitcoin is in plenty of supply as this sell off has been huge, look at the price.
@_date: 2018-12-22 08:14:06
I’ve been telling people on reddit for weeks, that they won’t get approval, and I stand by it.
When they do get approval, it will only be for cash settlement not physical BTC.

@_date: 2018-12-21 12:37:16
I don’t think it does, Equilibrium is an effect of the supply and demand being equal.

@_date: 2018-12-23 11:56:15
I agree with this, just one issue is how do we know there is that much BTC kept on exchanges?
I thought most people were savvy enough to store in a dedicated hardware wallet?.
Surely if large wallet holders (whales) are keeping their investments on exchanges then they do it for some reason?.
If there isn’t a reason, shame on them.
@_date: 2018-12-20 16:20:23
They’re not really going to give you a discount though are they, all they would do is make it look like they were, probably by increasing prices in the first place.
All amazon crypto currency would be, is a form of digital gift tokens ��.
I mean what would secure it from hacks and what would stop inflation of the tokens if it isn’t decentralised.
All this exercise is about is enslavement, once they’ve sold you the tokens they now know you can’t really go elsewhere, same with Facecrook, exactly the same thing, 
@_date: 2018-12-15 18:53:19
I agree on your first points.
Apart from those derivatives do effect the price of the real asset, this is indisputable.
I don’t think comparing the property market or house deeds is pertinent in any instant, BTC and property are completely different, I’m not one of those people who jump on main stream assets to try and justify why bitcoin can or can’t do something.
My meaning was forks are a flaw, no matter if people think they are not, as confidence is eroded leaving investors on the sidelines at best, at worst they walk away.
And I don’t think calling BTC Coke or Nike is realistic either, both companies are producing companies, BTC produces nothing, I would say they are behemoth companies compared to a tiny niche market like BItcoin.
At any point in the future a better crypto could*or almost definitely will*, that will take the BTC crown, and when you look at BTCs flaws that’s not going to be that hard IMO

Let me tell you all, what one of the biggest travesties is with KYC, all these exchanges and others in the traditional financial world taking your identification, just so they can sell it over or in some respects get it hacked by bad players.
All this proving  your identity is a ticking time bomb, eventually bad players will be cloning our identities and using those identities for all of the things they believe KYC is meant to stop.
IRONY ��‍♂️.

And prey tell what did they use on dark markets to buy drugs with before bitcoin?
Do you know what forensic tracing is?
What my point is, usually who ever is using BTC bought it at some point, if they  bought it through normal channels, then they have a finger print of who they are.
And if drugs markets are the best bitcoin can conquer, it’s found its niche, but personally I don’t think that’s a good selling point, mention that to the general public and they’ll distance themselves from it totally.
Also your not correct in part, as research show many have moved away from BTC, which isn’t that private, they are using more privacy coins and addresses like zcash and monero.
So BTCs opaqueness puts everyone off, from legitimate business to crooks and druggies on the dark web.
That’s irony my friend.
@_date: 2018-12-20 05:42:55
Look at the BTC price.
Equilibrium = supply and demand are equal, meaning stable price.
Demand outstrips supply = price increase
The supply out strips demand = this means price drops.
Bit coins manipulation is the only aspect that cannot be factored in to this supply and demand metric.
But be sure that when price is low demand is not there, and at the moment with miners desperate to sell, just to cover costs, you can bet by the low price, adoption isn’t happening.
So your halvening without steeper demand will be cancelled out.
Don’t built your hopes up on the or this BAKKT and other EFF rubbish.
@_date: 2018-12-14 16:04:01
Why do transaction fees need to skyrocket?
The whole idea is mass adoption right, so if you’re talking about a world in which BTC is used worldwide those fees would be ample for mining costs and profit, even if they are low.

He’s probably correct, what does Bitcoin do exactly?
It’s a lousy currency, in fact in some places it’s not even classed as such.
It’s slow, really slow, and can’t scale.
Globally its failed as its banned in some of the largest countries.
It’s more hassle that traditions payment methods.
No one talks about it in the real world, only on sites like reddit, is it promoted.
Regulators haven’t finished with it yet, in fact they’re only just starting.
Mining is becoming inefficient, due to the low BTC price.
And it’s so manipulated in so many ways it’s anybody’s guess what the price will be from one day to another, hardly a good investment.
And it has serious competition from crypto’s that are being designed from scratch by teams of professionals.

I wish people wouldn’t use the word permission less, it’s so not correct at a higher level in the structure.
For bitcoin to work, bitcoin needs permission to operate in the financial world, you may be able to send a payment without permission, but regulatory pressures mean, it does have to  reign in a permission system.
Something that’s completely permission less is complete fantasy.

You’re correct, and one of the only ones who understands supply and demand and price correlation ����.
Clearly all people are selling, whales, general hodlers *even though they deny they do*, miners, start ups, in fact lots of people have sold, the main reason is always panic as to how low the price may go, there is also huge manipulation going on, whales buying OCT and selling to lower prices, and futures contracts inflating the supply and also putting down pressure on the price.
But for me personally I just don’t believe all the hype about adoption, the price shows supply is easily outstripping demand, and even with such low prices the bears are clearly in charge.
We will go lower yet, bottom isn’t in, another dump is coming.
@_date: 2018-12-18 06:17:12

@_date: 2018-12-21 07:37:03
I don’t get any of this talk, simply BTCs design is the genius part, everyone seems to miss.
No one needs to own 21, or one whole BTC, all you need is some of the divisible coin, the reason is BTC could be worth any amount and your tiny amount may be worth a lot of money.
Simply put if 5 billion people all own $50 dollars worth, it’s just mooned.
It’s not the amount, it’s how many own a small amount.
@_date: 2018-12-17 06:52:57
Completely  disagree, like your post says it has crashed by over 80% and many have been badly burned, even if it had gone to 80k there would have been a bust.
Problem BTC has now is the population of earth knows the bubble popped, so even if it goes back up they’ll think it’s another bubble, the exception this time is they’ll be less likely to put money in, because the fear of losing is greater.
Plus if BTC had gone to 80k no investor on earth would take safe investment money out and put it into a non safe investment,( when I say safe I mean calculated risk).
And also the authorities wouldn’t let BTC get to 80k because of its destabilising effects on real asset classes that are traded each day.
Wall Street and the government look after their own in a centralised system, there would be hell to pay if the regulators let BTC become a threat to those monied People’s investment port folios “for sure”.
What you’ve said sounds good, but the reality is just fantasy, as in time you will see.
@_date: 2018-12-18 06:36:54
Don’t get the Lightening network, I mean I get what it can do, and it sounds an ok solution to a scaling problem.
But surely it’s useless without people are willing to use it, and why would anyone spend BTC, each spend or purchase is liable for property tax, which has to be reported to the relevant tax authority.
What this does is make every purchase dearer that your counterparts who is paying with fiat or card.
Saying LN fees are minimal may be correct, but technically with purchase tax taken into consideration its dearer and less appealing than the fiat system.
The only way this will compete is if BTC becomes reclassified as currency, and than the governments won’t be able to tax it, that isn’t going to happen ever.
So IMO it’s pretty useless because no one will spend extra just for the joy of using LN.
@_date: 2018-12-15 08:55:00
There is already more than 21 million, paper futures increase supply, what don’t people get about this.
And it’s irrelevant how many forks there is, the point is all these coins are easily reproduced, it doesn’t send out the right message, or help people have faith in this system.
@_date: 2018-12-15 16:49:29
Yes I agree, and I wouldn’t argue with your other comments either, that’s pretty much how the market is.
My only issue is making them require real BTC, how s that done, as regulators seem fine passing laws or not giving go aheads, knowing full well what their regulations or indecisive decisions mean for the BTC price.
All in all I think people in BTC don’t realise if BTC actually has to be bought, rather than faked, it will probably moon.
@_date: 2018-12-21 06:53:41
I think it’s different to Bitmex, as I understand Bitmex futures contract traders have to show they have the holdings in BTC already to pay out on a contract.
BAKKT I believe means “physical”as not cash settled.
And BAKKT will have to buy of exchanges in order to pay out the won contacts, this heaps demand pressure on the supply as long as the demand becomes greater, we should see serious price rises.
I personally still doubt they’ll get approval.
@_date: 2018-12-16 08:24:56
Your exactly correct, and this is how they are controlling the game and still making money.
@_date: 2018-12-16 08:28:59
Yes they are inflating the 21 million supply, he’s correct in what he’s telling you, they are lowering demand for real bitcoins, which increased supply and hence lowers price.
God given theft and manipulation, and 2019 will see a whole new wave of these futures, not settled in BTC but more cash.
Until those institution have to hold the physical amount of BTC to sell in those contracts, and also to settle those contracts, BITCOIN is ruined.

I see, that was just something I presumed after talking with someone else I’m afraid, but I’m pleased you’ve cleared that up for me.
So is it only exchanges you buy from, I understood miners also sell directly to OTC counters?
Is it also a myth then about buying large sums OTC and then dumping back on exchanges?
As if you’re buying at a premium, surely dumping would hurt your investment too.
Not really sure how this rumoured manipulation does work?.
@_date: 2018-12-15 15:55:50
Well no actually, a thick order book, isn’t price “EQUILIBRIUM”.
A stable price is achieved only when, the current supply is bought at the same rate as it’s produced.
If you think hodling coins doesn’t support price I think you should read more. 
It holds up prices because if those people sold their coins, and that would increase supply, if the supply was increased but demand was also low at that time the price would fall.
If they sold and demand was greater that supply then the price would rise.
Order books are not Guaranteed sales BTW, they are just orders, it’s like trying to work out how many people own crypto via wallet downloads, it gives massively misleading figures.
If a large number of coins moves from one wallet to others, people on reddit panic, “why”, because they know a dump may come and increase supply massively taking down the price to new lows, if that wallet holds and doesn’t dump it supports the overall price, to a point I agree, but support it does.

Your believe what you like, but they’ve tamed BTC, and they have it right where they want it.
Of course gold futures don’t cause inflation in the gold market either do they, do you realise how much an ounce of gold would be worth if only physical gold existed ( COMEX ARE ALSO VERY CLEAVER), inflation lowers the price.
Maybe this link with teach you how and why futures contracts in all fields increase the total supply.
This is connected to gold but it’s the same idea.

Can’t see how anyone can call it not wasteful, it’s just an added burden on the poor as global warming effects them first.

Yeah POW is a smart move.

All purchases and services paid with BTC are liable for tax at a set rate.
If you do not add that tax on those purchases you are liable for court proceeding via the IRS for tax evasion.
Good luck with that one, because one of BTCs flaws is it total transparency, you will be traced and face the tax justice system.
So what does that have to do with “LN”?
So add on the tax for the purchase and you’ll realise now that “LN”is way more expensive than using VISA or MASTERCARD, because as I said it is not classed as a currency.
It isn’t classed as a currency for one reason, if it was allocated this title, it would mean no taxes would be due, as it’s classed as *property*, the subsequent taxes are charged at what ever rates apply in your country of residence.
LN is a complete waste of time as people will not use crypto over traditional means, as the later isn’t tax liable.
You do realise logging every purchase and sale is hassle over paying with a card or a dollar, where clearly you do not have to log every buy.
I’ve been pointing out BTCs flaws constantly and no one listens because they have been sold upon it without asking any questions, even then they go into self denial over any of those issues.
If I buy a coffee for 1dollar fast and free (fine).
If I buy a coffee for 1dollar and have 25% tax on top, now it’s not fine.
That’s the reality of using BTC as a currency, plus many other faults it has on top.
You decide if you think BTC will be used?.
You decide now whether you’ll use it or hoard it?.
You decide now whether you think shops will pay your tax for you?.
You decide it all shops will put up prices to cover your tax?.
You decide if speed through LN isn’t really that necessary now, because traditional payments work fine?.
Now ask yourself why peter tiel of Paypal hasn’t accepted BTC, Amazon, EBay, Alibaba ect.., because of the fact it’s not a currency.

I think your not reading the post correctly, it doesn’t say anything about who’s bought and what gains they’ve made, it’s talking about people who haven’t bought in, seeing the price as an obstacle because they don’t understand divisibility.
Meaning that they believe the price is a barrier when really it is not.
Sure I get what your saying, but basic realisation is, because this isn’t known by most they’re far less likely to buy.
@_date: 2018-12-16 10:54:47

Glaringly obvious that telling them you’ve lost your private key is a sure fire way out of paying any tax, what are they going to monitor each and every wallet that has funds in?

Great in a niche market like bitcoin is, but the general public can’t be bothered with all that hassle, they have fiat and debit and credit cards.
Nothing else does what BTC can do, what 7 transactions a second ����‍♂️.
@_date: 2018-12-20 05:58:55
I think when the price is low, there has either been a large sell off, or unknown manipulation.
Price surges can also be manipulated via one means or another.
So both of the above including everyday trading activity are impossible to gauge accurately.
But the best metric for use in any market is price correlation to supply.
Equilibrium = a stable price because buy orders match the amount of BTC produced.
Low demand and higher supply = this will mean price correction down, as there are that many buying and probably more sell orders than buys.
The golden goose, when demand constantly outstrips the supply = price increasing to what ever the demand is, but for sure the price goes sky high.
And the moment there is not demand and there is “for sure more supply “than people wanting to buy the price will go down.
OTC counter that are selling large amounts constantly would eventually run out or lower the known supply because mathematically the miners can only mine so many per annum.
So the maths and the supply and demand metric do tell a lot about the health of any market.
BTW how much are OTC, BTC sold for, are they discounted for a large buy?.
@_date: 2018-12-15 17:25:34
Didn’t I just say all that, if you read your repeating what I’ve already stated, just for you once again.
1) pay with BTC, no recourse what so ever, no legal expenses, no legal representation and certainly no refund.
2) pay with a credit card all of the above, it’s actually better than a bank transfer because the payment can be revoked.
3) I could pay via a form of bank transfer and I’d have more back up than BTC would ever give me.
Please don’t argue or try and claim BTC is a secure payment method, no one backs it.!!!
I could always ping you over my credit card cover and all the legal jargon.
Same with PayPal, full refund if the goods are faulty ect.
We have consumer law, and consumer protection.
BTC isn’t part of those rules of payment, are you getting it yet.
*Clue*, key word is regulated.

It’s a ridiculous excuse for money, no one spends it, as it may be worth more tomorrow, many shops have stopped accepting it because no one uses it, it’s slow and cumbersome compared with a debit card, that are accepted world wide with financial backing.
So no it’s not a currency.
As for the limited supply, apart from forking incidents and inflation of the 21 million supply via cash settled futures products, it can do the other things you’ve mentioned, but set supply is on shaky ground.
I also clearly understand price and correlation to supply and demand, waste your links on yourself.
Blinding yourself with market cap figures is nonsense as I’ve told you it produces nothing, it isn’t a productive asset, hence the reason it’s market cap drops like a stone periodically.
Investors aren’t interested in maybe’s.
Oh and BTC will be here in 10 years, well how many times has BTC been found with serious vulnerability, and has just been lucky those haven’t been found by rogue players?
BTC could have fallen on numerous occasions, so predicting its future shows you don’t understand anything.
Dividends give investors a certain security which BTC doesn’t was the point, clearly they are different, most investors prefer more security than not knowing whether the value will be high or “ZERO”.

Well actually we could argue the 21 million cap has been raised, via Bitcoin futures bringing inflation.
And we could argue that not many projects promised have been implemented or have made that much difference as of now.
And the mast sell off, isn’t IMO a sign of things being better now, than when demand was outstripping supply and large profits where being made.
Apart from those issues you’re correct.

The bottom line is these people have invested big in this space, I cannot see them being stupid enough to walk away without getting their initial investments back out.
And I don’t believe anyone that says they won’t sell, being a bag holder is not a smart move.
And lower the price goes, everyone’s brain is saying do I buy or do I sell, often buying gets put off because of the fear it may go lower.
Like now, it’s either going up or down, could stay stable but I think there’s lower prices coming.
@_date: 2018-12-18 18:41:27
Yes but that causes a taxable event as soon as you move that crypto out of your wallet onto that debit card.
And if that isn’t a taxable event, the purchases are, especially in the US.
Just can’t see what’s the point of it is, over using a debit card.
@_date: 2018-12-15 10:15:33
Yes you’re correct, except I wouldn’t pay in cash because I also know by paying in cash I have no come backs either.
BTC and cash are very similar in this respect.
Paying with a credit or debit, the former being more secure IMO, is the way to go, fees occur because of the backing you are receiving 24/7 from that card issuer.
Fees low with BTC, because no back up.

Once again because your not very sharp, I said.
1) government don’t care if you leave the country because BTC holders are wankers and there aren’t many of them.
2)governments can crush BTC with tax, just like this rule shows, personally I’d make it 80%! For the French as I don’t like em.

Weird question that was, but if you ever saw a financial crash as big as that, which may I add you won’t ever.
Firstly if you owed money on a mortgage, chances are you’d not have a job and no means to pay, because now you’ve defaulted on your payments the government would simply reposes your home.
The government would own streets and streets of homes of property payment defaulters.
You won’t ever get away with not paying your debt, simple.
@_date: 2018-12-18 07:58:48
That’s irrelevant Bitcoin is not classed as currency, and because the Blockchain is so opaque, not declaring those buys and sales is fraud.
You will be waiting for a knock on your door or a letter through the post, it doesn’t work as a currency, it is not as economical as fiat which may I add doesn’t incur tax.
Sorry to spoil the party but these are facts of law.

Yes, you can put it that way.
But solely as a peer to peer system, I’d agree, but for expansion and adoption there is no doubt BTC needs the right regulations to succeed, so I wouldn’t say it completely permission less, I think that’s more wishful thinking.
@_date: 2018-12-14 17:51:12
No of course it’s not wasteful ��.
All that energy to produce coins people hodl in wallets, where as most people don’t give a shit, as they have fiat and debit.
Plus POS maybe you can inflate the amount of  coins, but you can with BTC too.
@_date: 2018-12-19 19:35:23
Who’s told you this?
There is no information saying that, it is a complete and utter rumour, plus they only need hold BTC, if their futures contracts are to be paid out in said BTC.
For the record, no one has given them regulatory permission to settle contracts in physical BTC, it clearly states through what BAKKT have said, and that is (regulatory approval is still to be given).
The bottom line is they won’t get this approval, just like no ETFs have had approval, and the reason is, that the regulators don’t want the BTC price reaching heights they will deem dangerous to them and other things in the main stream financial system.
And as for the halvening, well they’ve happened before and no price rises have occurred, halvenings depend also on high demand and low supply, if they aren’t in play no price rise occurs.
@_date: 2018-12-14 19:05:40

No because it’s a set supply, irrelevant of how much hash power you have, you cannot mine BTC any faster or get more BTC from a block reward.
I think the block reward is 12 right now, if you had all the computers in the universe mining BTC the algorithm would adjust and make it harder for you to find the key for the block reward.
You would only get 12 BTC.
Same if the hashrate is lowered, the algorithm will adjust down, making it easier to find the key for the block reward.
Yet again only 12 for the reward.
This is why all BTC will be mined to the day in 2140, it is pure genius.
Really hashrate is only security of the network, it’s very hard if not impossible to implement a 51% attack, because you’d have to match or exceed that computational power.
The more hash power the more secure, NOT THE FASTER YOU MINE, and the reward is set, only when halvenings arrive is the Block reward lowered.
You can’t cheat this system ����.

@_date: 2018-12-15 10:00:25
I’d agree to what you’ve said partly, the word instantly with bitcoin always grinds a little though.
But I am no way going to agree that a decentralised justice system, could ever have the insurance and backing of a centralised system.
For instance if in spend 10k on a faulty car today, I can get my bank to issue proceeding on my behalf against that individual, if i had transferred 10k in BTC to their wallet address, no way will I see my money again.
It’s a hard process with insurance and legal backing, IMO an impossible one without that may i add, will definitely cost you more than the loses you’ve already incurred.
Be very careful transacting in crypto for these reasons.
@_date: 2018-12-17 20:30:05
Bit you don’t know what the price will be, so it’s pure conjecture IMO, a gain is a gain and a loss is a loss, the exception or point here is entry can be pretty low.
Not high like they see it without knowing the truth, and this stops adoption moving as fast as it could.
Do some fractional maths and you can see this.
@_date: 2018-12-16 06:52:39
Because, bitcoin doesn’t function very well without these promised add on’s, they wouldn’t be implementing them if they thought it did.
Secondly they’ve been banging on about most of them for over a year now, and the same old posts keep appearing saying the same old things (nothing new).
Thirdly BTC isn’t in a good place at the moment, no doubt those software updates may add a little value to the Blockchain and to the BTC tokens that people own.
And fourth, without implementation, no one truly knows whether they work or how efficient they are.
So yes they should get on with it, but this is what happens when a group like BLOCKSTREAM are the gate keepers and decision makers for everyone.
Oh and WHY was a fools question, if you just thought about things yourself, you wouldn’t need that word ever again.

 Nope, if I pay by credit card and you rip me off, I can contact my credit card company, report the incident and have the payment stopped, if the payment has gone through already, the credit car company will reimburse me, then they will take their own action against in this case the car seller.
They have a large legal team, very deep pockets and generally the law on their side, I live in a first world country and it’s common knowledge making a credit card payment gives you cover you wouldn’t have elsewhere.

Rubbish, I live in the U.K. and we have VAT (value added tax) everyone pays it on purchases.
If you don’t pay your crypto tax’s.
1)you end up in prison.
2) or the government will implement a crypto added tax at source.
I mean if I was in charge and I new crypto users were skirting the tax law, that’s what I’d do, make it law and add on the tax to all purchases.
Look if you think crypto can win your wrong, they can regulate it down to zero, it’s only here because they let it be.
Wake up soon.
If your online shopping is with BTC and you’ve not declared the tax, then yes they will catch up with you.
@_date: 2018-12-15 08:39:04
We weren’t talking about fiat currency with is completely different and works under a completely different mechanism, or is meant to.
As for gold and silver, their limited supply is inflated, you see if you take an Olympic size swimming pool, you probably fill one with all the gold that exists on earth.
Problem is more paper gold contracts exist than the amount of gold, this suppresses the price of gold, it’s legal but in many ways robbery from the people who own the physical stuff.
So the answer to your question is yes gold and silver are not fixed amounts and are manipulated to increase the supply.
Getting back to bitcoin, it’s supply is no doubt manipulated in the same respect through BTC futures contracts, this is fact don’t argue it please.
The forked coins just prove that even though algorithmically bitcoins supply is set, other clones are easily manufactured.
Any coin in the future that takes BTCs place I’ll bet eliminates forks.

That’s very true and very sensible, all people who have invested in Bitcoin are being stolen from IMO, and something needs to be done, before people become disillusioned with the current situation.
But I cannot see any future trading desks including BAKKT, having the permission to settle in BTC.
We all know this will increase demand, and lower supply depending on the institutional demand for the contracts, but best case scenario the price would rocket up.
It seems clear they don’t want the threat.
So where is BTC going.

Hi I have an off topic question and wondered whether you know, I have an iPhone with all my crypto wallets on, I have backed up my phone to iCloud.
When I get my new phone and I wipe the old one, my wallets and their info should come back via iCloud backup to my new iPhone.
Am I correct, or is there anything else I need do, as I don’t want to loose those wallets and their transaction history.
@_date: 2018-12-18 12:27:21
@_date: 2018-12-17 05:57:17
I think your first question depends on how many they sell, and what the expiry date of those contracts is, while they are live is where the inflation will be, that will cancel out when they expire.
But inflation non the less, and because all of these institutions want a piece of the action then it will only get worse.
I’d be surprised at the next part, I’ve not heard that, but surprised because of the security risk, as not holding in a hardware wallet is extremely silly.
Lastly I agree, but I’m not sure that campaign will reach enough people first time around, it may have to be re-run numerous times until they have got the msg.
@_date: 2018-12-15 16:19:15
That’s not really what I’m saying, I’m saying it’s the fact that forking can happen, people lose confidence in the product, as you’ve recently seen with the hash wars, hey I know people who were horrified that money invested could be effected by unknown quantities or people at any time.
Confidence = investor security, forking doesn’t give that.
I can answer your last part though about Bcash and BTC and the same amount for it, you know the bit you wrote.
How’s about I buy Bitcoin without buying bitcoin or needing a wallet or even interacting with a Blockchain, and still making money of it, now wouldn’t that be a really smart trick???!.

@_date: 2018-12-16 07:15:29
That may sound true, but in reality it isn’t, if you take into consideration Blockstream inc, then you realise actually they are the ones who make the decisions.
There are many people in BTC they do not all get a choice about what they’d like, that is a democracy and a democratic vote, these so called forks are not that kind of vote.
They are usually greedy people with a motive of creating more coins, with the sole purpose of selling those coins for profit, and at the same time attacking a rival coin or causing trouble in other ways.
They have a knock on effect, for investor confidence also.
And any arguments people put forward the 21 million debate, is always by the masses jumped upon, when they realise “hey you’ve just replicated more coin ��”.
So trying for mass adoption becomes harder as people become untrusting and confused, they lose belief.

May as well just use fiat.
@_date: 2018-12-15 15:28:31
You are correct in what you say, but they hodl because it supports the price, that’s why everyone encourages hodling.
Those Hodled holdings make up the grand total of sales, if all of a sudden those hodlers started selling the price would collapse.
If you don’t believe me, think of this, the vast majority of BTC are owned by 4% of hodlers, whale wallets, if they all dump their stock, the price would plummet.
Hence all hodling is doing is supporting the BTC price.
Because BTC doesn’t work well enough as a payment rail, without “LN”, and not many places accept it, I personally think it won’t make that much difference to adoption.
People either want it or they don’t, BTC best bet is gold like store of value yet its volatility is its Achilles heel here also.
@_date: 2018-12-13 20:00:25

The first line of that is crap,”can’t be faked”.
In the real world, they are constantly forked, and now inflated via paper cash settled futures, and may I add that will only get worse.
One of BTCs problems from day one was the fork events.
Plus it can’t instantly teleport, in fact it’s slow.
Yes no one can stop your payment, best make sure you never require a refund,
Immutability is a ridiculous attraction.
Never be more than 21 million bitcoins.
Bitcoin cash
Bitcoin Sv 
Bitcoin abc
Bitcoin diamond
Bitcoin yada yada coin.
Yeah no more than 21 million.

BTC isn’t money it doesn’t act as money because it’s not stable in any way,
It’s not used in real time, only for speculation.
And do I really have to send you information on how supply and demand works?
Oh and BTC doesn’t produce any value, it is not a value producing asset, would you like some links to understand this issue, also it doesn’t pay a dividend.
