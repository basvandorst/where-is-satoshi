There are only 2 ways to fix this. And it has nothing to do with miners or pools.
If you want this totally decentralized , open source , and free.
Then 1) the developers must implement a core protocol change to eliminate pooled mining.
2) bitcoin must fail, and we must start over.
If you believe in free market , and decentralization , then these are the only two outcomes.

You are a fool , zero fees is a new business model? Lol 
What business operates on zero income? How is that a business? 
How will they pay their operating costs ?

You do not understand free market.
Free markets dictate that people will try and probably succeed at centralizing mining , and the blockchain will die ... Fast and hard ... As soon as this happens. A new blockchain will be bootstrapped shortly thereafter that will in some way eliminate the possibility of centralized mining . Money will be lost but not all that much in the scene of things.
Free market must allow for failure, and it must allow for failure early in the game (which it still is).
What you are talking  about ( this is why the free market is bad) is an argument FOR centralization. You are completely wrong and don't have a clue as to what your talking about.
Free market is all about failure, it is a core tenant that the free market allows for failure , because failure is the very mechanism that drives innovation and highest use of resources , and rapid divestment from inefficient , unprofitable and flawed ventures.  It is the mechanism by which old wealth is destroyed to make way for new wealth. 
I suggest you take your centralized big government views elsewhere pal.
And I'll say it

IMO , they should just shift the decimal place as the price dictates, and rename the larger units.
I.e shift the decimal place 3 places right now so that 1 bitcoin is worth about 49 cents. 1000 bitcoins will be worth 490 bucks.
It's like a dollar , a dollar is not the largest unit of measurement , a million dollars is just a million dollars , it's not a mega dollar or some shit.
