With that much hashing power I think it would be more profitable to simply 51% the network :P
@_date: 2012-11-30 11:09:39
The main thing is that it changes 6-block verification from 1 hour to 15 minutes. For Internet transactions that's pretty significant.
And the overhead of generating a block is insignificant, won't the same number of transactions result in the same disk space?
@_date: 2012-10-18 11:59:30
I think if a few people leave and pump the market full of coins, the other 2.2 million people will happily snatch some of them up.
Edit: I think a worthless Bitcoin would be one that takes up more storage space than it is worth if redeemed.

@_date: 2012-09-07 09:14:00
You live in the US and you think it's difficult? :-P
Here in NZ we have a single local market with a miniscule volume for a 13%+ fee. Or I can buy them via SLL for a 15%+ fee. Or possibly via Buybitcoin.com for a 60% fee... I think those are the only three options I actually have.
@_date: 2012-06-16 21:41:58
Not surprised at all that it wasn't put together by Deepbit. That pool really seems to hate dealing with cheap transactions.
@_date: 2012-07-01 00:17:35
On a 7mbit connection from NZ, it took me about a days' solid downloading to update the blockchain from scratch.
I think you can download caches of the blockchain from torrents, but it's probably not worth it. You could get a temporary e-wallet for now while you download, and then transfer all your finds when it finally loads.
@_date: 2012-09-14 12:18:37
I think it has value for processing transactions faster - but it's never going to replace BTC or have nearly as much value.
(Waiting at least an hour for the network to confirm a single transaction... sigh.)
@_date: 2012-10-18 02:44:34
Hahaha, you'll need much more than 10 BTC for some of that right now.
@_date: 2012-12-03 02:25:26
Correct, but unless most blocks are completely empty, the majority of disk space will be taken up by transactions rather than block headers. I think at the moment most Bitcoin blocks have 30-60 transactions and that number is only going to increase, therefore an increased number of blocks will be insignificant compared to the disk space of the transactions.
Or put it in another way: The Bitcoin blockchain right now [is 2800 MB for 210k blocks]( Block overhead is therefore 40 MB. If Bitcoin had instead 840k blocks right now, the Bitcoin blockchain would grow 4% to 2920 MB.
I'd call that pretty insignificant.
@_date: 2012-09-03 03:17:24
Therefore not all nations are in debt :P

@_date: 2012-12-02 11:38:48
That's odd, I was of the understanding that a transaction takes up as much disk space as the header for a new block. Compare [an empty block]( (0.2 KB) with [one with ~35 transactions]( (11.7 KB).
@_date: 2012-08-08 04:53:31
I think it depends on your country, your state, your trading status (individual/business) and who you purchase Bitcoins from.
@_date: 2012-09-14 22:11:08
At six blocks an hour, and six blocks minimum to confirm a transaction, I don't think it can be done faster than an hour.

I did a quick study. From a sample of n=22 orphaned and accepted blocks:
* Accepted blocks: mean size 198.59 kb, st.dev 76.31 kb. Mean fees 0.433 btc, st.dev 0.229 btc.
* Orphaned blocks: mean size 194.22 kb, st.dev 113.47 kb. Mean fees 0.342 btc, st.dev 0.241 btc.
Therefore, if you can say anything (which you can't with such a small sample size, R^2 = 0.0005), it's that:
1. Smaller blocks are more likely to become orphaned.
2. Extremely large or extremely small blocks are more likely to become orphaned c.f. the mean block size.
3. Transactions in blocks with lower overall fees are more likely to become orphaned.

My passphrase-protected wallet (with an extremely strong phrase) is encrypted (with a different extremely strong phrase) and then backed up on this machine, backed up on my on-site server, which is then encrypted with GPG and backed up to Amazon.
I have a backup of my passphrase and my GPG keys in another encrypted file stored on the cloud. All software used is open source.
I think storing things in the cloud is fine as long as you hold _all_ the keys and they're strong.

It's not just bandwidth (which isn't just mining but also transmitting transactions to the entire network) but also storage. Right now the blockchain is increasing 7 GB/year; increasing block size to 10MB or 100MB could increase that to 70 GB/year (taking up most SSDs) or 700 GB/year (beyond most SSDs).
Right now one can run a Bitcoin client on a reasonable machine with a reasonable network connection, and it should remain like that for safety and security of the network.

But it's not like adding more transactions makes block solving more difficult. It's in the miners' best interest to include as many fees as possible.
@_date: 2013-03-07 21:01:13
That's a huge argument for not changing maximum block sizes at all.
But practically, lets say it takes the same amount of time to solve a block with 0 and with N transactions, and lets say each node has a standard latency - the only factor is the network bandwidth. Practically and statistically, the chance of two separate miners solving two separate blocks at the same time (or within the mean time to transmit a block within the network) is essentially zero, considering the network difficulty.
I'd love to see a study on whether larger block sizes _actually_ are more likely to become orphaned. I doubt it's the case.
@_date: 2013-05-29 02:06:30

It's also a massive cowboy/unethical alert.
If you're investing in any new product or service, you owe it to your employees to actually pay them like professionals. That's how you get good work, not rushed work. If I'm developing a game, I'm still going to pay the artists I need.
Alternatively, if all of the employees are under startup/ownership agreements, you should expect bankruptcy (because you are betting your entire startup on it). If I'm starting a startup, I want to fail quickly and cleanly so I can start again, not owing employees massive amounts of salary.

You can say that. The default client is just warning you that if you didn't, then your transaction might take a _long_ time to get included. In the order of weeks. (Look at the age of [some unconfirmed transactions](

I think the way the existing clients/miners generally handle it, is that transactions will be included based on f(age^n, size^n, fee^n ). If clients/miners stop processing things with 0 fee, what if people just increase their transaction fee to 1 satoshi? etc. 
0 fee transactions will probably always be supported (they just might take days to execute).

I've been using this site internally for about a year now and it's been _really_ useful, so this week I've cleaned it up, published it open source and made it public.
The site lets you anonymously add public addresses and read-only APIs for exchanges/mining pools/securities, regularly retrieves their balance, and compiles reports displaying e.g. your net USD/BTC/... worth, the composition of your currencies, historical exchange data, your total USD/BTC/... worth, etc.
So far it supports BTC, LTC, NMC / USD, NZD / Mt.Gox, BTC-e, Vircurex, BitNZ / Litecoin Global, Btct.co, Pool-x.eu and generic APIs.
I want to add more currencies, exchanges, pools and reports - what should I add? I've already been [asked twice]( to add Feathercoin support, which I'll try to add tonight.

That's fine for miners but not for users. It's also fine if all users are also miners, but I still can't buy a cost-effective BTC miner. Increasing the block size is a good way to limit network security and participation.

Miners aren't the one that hold all the wallets, I just run a client and I haven't upgraded yet because I don't want to redownload the blockchain.

GPUs are still sold in [100 million/year+]( If an LTC ASIC even requires 1% as many transistors as a GPU, the LTC ASIC market is probably _way_ too small to justify development.
Whereas SHA-256 is ridiculously trivial to ASICize.
That said I really do hope LTC ASICs come out one day, and that the BTC ASIC lessons will have been learnt and we won't have a monopoly of single-digit supply.

More like a ladder, with no trickle-down. It's pretty obvious what it is.
@_date: 2013-03-07 21:29:31
And now that I think about it, doesn't the default client prefer the blockchain that is larger? i.e. given two conflicting blocks, it will choose the larger one?
@_date: 2013-04-12 23:04:37
Agreed. From what I can tell even LMAX is designed to be single threaded. Introducing the resource and scalability problems of Javascript is going to seriously hinder the performance of the platform. I'd imagine PHP optimised later into Java optimised later into C as necessary.
I've thought of building an exchange too, and I still think that having a master trade processing server/thread is still probably the most correct option. You don't want to have multiple threads with incomplete information unless you want to reduce the precision of trades.

Yup - and once you interact with fiat, you need to comply with financial regulations (or rely on wire exchanges to an offshore country only).
As a software architect the technical side of running an exchange, while not trivial, isn't extremely difficult. It's the regulation side that has closed most exchanges, not the technical side; and attracting critical mass is the next hardest problem.

Within the default clients transactions are included based on their size (kb), size (btc), age and fee, so eventually yes. That's why the default client suggests high fees for large kb transactions, and no fees for large btc transactions.

That's 1000 executed trades per second, not 1000 bids/asks placed per second. Think of it as a batch file, but one that runs all the time. I can't imagine trading on an exchange that has a 24 hour trade delay (all the bids would come in at 23:59:59!).
If you made it truly instant, you would have the web UI executing trades, which is both horribly unscalable and a terrible security risk. At the very least you need to have a trade engine that near-instantly executes submitted bid/asks. My guess is Mt.Gox lag comes from poor architecture.
