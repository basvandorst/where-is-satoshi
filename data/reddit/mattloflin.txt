How many times did you click refresh?

Will do!

I have no basis to argue as I don't know the plethora of services available. From the basis of a user who is new to Bitcoin - Coinbase came across as one of the most popular and easiest to find/setup/use providers. 
Can you give me a glimpse inside your view?

Updated - thanks!

UPS My Choice just said it arrived - location: the abyss.

Coinbase has the option for the user to manage their own private keys - are you saying this is an issue?
I'm one of the &lt;insert small number&gt;% of Windows Phone users - any recommendation for us?

I've been watching this thread - looks like he had a local wallet and the private key was logged/stolen at some point and later stolen.
Note to self (again) Private key == bitcoin == cash AND start small.

What do you think it would take for the price to be "stabilized"? Mass adoption???


Is the basis of this statement to secure the large investments in bitcoin securely/offline so that if &lt;X&gt; service/exchange is hacked then those are safe? Inline with my statement of *"as Savings Accounts, Safety Deposit boxes, Safes at home - for the larger amounts that you want more secure"*

Great advice, this was my theory going into it. I like to streamline anything financial so I have an *'auto-buy'* setup monthly to purchase a small amount of Bitcoin. This allows me to learn while also increasing my investment.

Next prediction: the price on May 9th, 2016 will **not** be $242.76 :D

You know when you start math with counting then addition/subtraction then multiplication/division... these articles are the multiplication/division up to algebra/geometry view of the world.
Questions for you/others:
1) What is the importance of a change address if 'common user' is using a service that takes care of that for you? 
2) Some of these articles make it seem that *"you should only use bitcoin if your goal is to be anonymous"* - should that be the intent?
3) For the mass adoption of Bitcoin to occur, users need to be comfortable in using the system without knowing the 0's and 1's - Do you think it is critical for all users to comprehend the above?

Nope :( will research / find one and update
edit: Looks like [Bitcoin Can]( &amp; [Bitcoin] ( are the popular apps for windows phone to let you buy/sale on Blockchain or Coinbase.
There are other options too that allow research, trade, etc. [link] (

I agree - just like you wouldn't have your cash / stock all in one account / bank / location, the same holds true here.
@_date: 2015-05-09 21:49:32
Can you explain this a bit more? Connecting the dots I assume all addresses can be looked up on blockinfo, however you can make the lookup 2fa - right?

The prices were actuals on those dates - the predictions is more my comments regarding the prices :)
