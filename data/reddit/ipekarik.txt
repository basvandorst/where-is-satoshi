That seems like a fallacy to me. There'll always be enough BTC to support broader usage and millions of transactions, it will just have to be acquired at a higher price and spent at fractions of a BTC. 
There's no inherent shortage of BTC that results from holding. You can still buy 5 € worth of BTC and purchase 5 € worth of goods or services from vendors who accept BTC, no matter what the availability (meaning market value) of BTC is.

You don't seem to understand how tax systems work. VAT is one of many taxes. Wherever it was implemented it did not (fully) replace other taxes. It's an additional tax and it doesn't have nearly enough income capacity to fund societal needs. Look up the budgets of any VAT-using country (this is public information) and calculate the percentage of VAT income in the total budget income. It's a sizeable fraction, but a fraction none the less.
**Edit:** For example, in Croatia, VAT income is 57 billion HRK, while the taxation of our personal income (the difference between net and gross salary) pumps in 40 billion, and additional taxes add another 10 billion to the pool. VAT is close to 50% of our tax income stream. We have 25% VAT.

Can someone ELI5 why using Armory is better than printing an offline wallet via bitaddress.org, storing it in a safety deposit box (or any other physically secure location) and simply safeguarding your online identity (i.e. not giving anybody any reason to link the public address of the wallet to your personal identity and, by extension, the safe storing the private key)?

It's a chicken and egg issue, IMHO. One won't happen without the other, this speculation is what also drives adoption.
@_date: 2013-11-25 13:29:33
That is true, to some extent. However, there are realistic expenses not related to bureaucratic overhead. Continuing on the example of my country, if we were to simply stop paying everyone employed for the Croatian government (meaning, stop spending on inneficient goverment altogether), VAT alone would *still* not cover public spending. 
We spend only 20-30 billion of our budget on goverment functioning. The rest (under)pays our teachers, doctors, nurses, cops, firefighters...

Is reddit now a football match? We're rooting for preferred subreddits and labelling people based on their subscriptions? Take it easy, treat topics a comment at a time.

It means exactly what it means - an objectively measured information on past performance of the bitcoin economy. This is nothing to you, but to many people it's exciting. It's four years of exponential growth of an open source global currency based on cryptography and freedom of information. Even if it crashes tomorrow and never recovers, it will still have been a pretty damn exciting story to follow for many.


Probably, to people investing in USD at the time, yes. Excitement is quite a personal thing, really, you don't get to decide where and what people get their kicks from.

Over at my place we call that the *Home Theater PC* these days, and it's hooked to our TV pretty much like our old ZX Spectrum was back in the day. It's in the TV rack with the PS3 and is used for games, movies and music. The only reason it's even there is because it was too good of a gaming &amp; Photoshop machine to simply throw away when we were redecorating the living-room and wanted to get rid of the "PC corner".
Our everyday internetin' is done almost exclusively via laptop and mobile. I use both, while my wife is almost exclusively on mobile.
I haven't even thought about it as anything peculiar until I saw this thread. Damn, times are changing fast.

Oh, wow. You sure do get downvoted consistently. I'm no reddit doctor, but you should have that checked out.
In any case, I do agree with a level headed approach to bitcoin, you're completely right in pointing that out. I can imagine a lot of younger people being first-time investors with bitcoin, as it was targeted to that demographic. There's a lot of magic and awe in this magic internet money and it's easy to get enamoured with the concept. I'd hate to see people go all in and get really hurt.

How exactly would one "control" bitcoin exchanges, does anyone have any inputs on potential mechanisms for this?


And what exactly is the problem that needs solving?
Edit: Just in case it wasn't obvious - I wasn't being sarcastic, I'm actually interested in the clarification of the problems of a governmentally uncontrolled bitcoin. Anyone?

Without additional taxation you can't have functioning public spending. VAT alone is not nearly enough to fill up public budgets, not by a long shot.

Ah, yes, your horcrux analogy up there. Nice. :) 
Sure, this all makes perfect sense and really ups the security, but my question is more along the lines - is this additional security really necessary?
I mean, a basic paper wallet in a safe, if used properly, seems extremely safe to me. Someone would literally have to rob the safety deposit box to get to the BTC ballance, provided I never put the private key anywhere on any digital device. For this to happen they would have to know the physical location of that safety deposit box, meaning they would have to know my identity and the fact that I indeed own bitcoin. A lot of work. Considering I personally will never have more than a couple of BTC because I'm as poor as a church mouse, spending all that time in Armory seems... an overkill.
Am I wrong for some reason? I obviously am (Armory wouldn't otherwise exist), but I'm a complete BTC noob and am still trying to wrap my head around the way this works.
**Edit:** Also, that's the biggest bitcoin adoption hurdle right there. I feel like I'm studying for an exam just to buy and safely store 1 BTC.

You're going about that in an awfully calm fashion, I must say.
@_date: 2013-11-11 11:39:23
I see. 
What you're describing here basically transcends the usual way of thinking about money, into which I've become conditioned. What you're saying is, if I'm interpreting correctly, is that using these security features enables my bitcoin stash to be secured well *above* the level regular financial institutions offer (barring 100% insurance schemes)?
@_date: 2013-11-12 06:58:21


That's a lot of faith in what is still essentially a financial experiment. While I appreciate it as a fellow experimenter, I would also -- like a *fellow* experimenter -- caution you to diversify.

I'm curious - and feel free not to answer if it's TMI - how does the volatility of bitcoin affect your margins? Do you exchange bitcoin revenue immediately into a more stable currency or do you risk profits by keeping a portion of the company revenue in bitcoin reserve?

A startup is any company still in search and/or development of a long-term sustainable business model. Once it has that, it's just a company. But the tweaking process of getting there is called being a startup.
Gyft is still developing its network and my guess is that it will not be fully sustainable until that network is redundant enough and with a proven track record with retailers. However, as I'm talking out off my ass here, I should stop while I still have a chance at being remotely correct about any of this.
@_date: 2013-11-12 11:30:26


That's subject to opinion, I guess. 
The price is still very volatile and the market is largely speculative, which makes it quite difficult for businesses to rely on this currency for daily trade. (e.g. If I sell something to you for 100$ worth in bitcoin, and two hours later that bitcoin is worth 80-90$, I've just lost my margin... there are workarounds, but not all businesses are willing or even able to work at that mind-boggling bitcoin pace.)
The fact that the value is now arbitrarily perceived (doesn't stem *significantly* from usefulness in trading of goods, but is largely agreed upon on bitcoin math and demand, similar to the agreed/perceived value of gold) makes it harder for the average Joe to buy in. 260 € per BTC is well above the means of many. I can't afford more than a bitcoin or two. So when I do buy in, it's an investment buy-in, not currency exchange. The market is still tiny because of guys like me, and because of the mining math.
As more businesses grow balls to *do* take the risk of, essentially, trading in digital gold, bitcoin will start behaving less like gold (savings) and more like transaction currency, leading to gradual growth in adoption with the average Joe who's willing to spend his gold on goods and services. When and if this will occur is still a very unreliable variable and we're taking this on faith and optimism. And the percieved value of bitcoin is still likely to grow at that point, making it even harder for the average Joe to buy in. Or not. I haven't got a fucking clue. Which is my point.
Also, worldwide governments are still unsure how to regulate this financial transaction market, if at all. Some countries might even move to very strict regulation or outright outlawing (under pressure from the regular financial industry, with their business being hurt by the growing adoption of a low-to-no-fee currency such as bitcoin). Again, I haven't got a clue. I can only hope for the best, but history teaches us that countries and markets are run pretty much by complete idiots. I have no reason to expect an easy ride in the legal department. If the value does continue to grow and I start cashing out huge dollar or euro profits that raise eyebrows, I'll be really anxious to see how my government views those transactions legally and, not less important, how it decides to tax them. It's a legitimate concern that hasn't yet been addressed in many countries.
I'm very optimistic on the prospects of bitcoin based on the growth and development of this economy in the past, but the reality is - I simply don't know how even one of these variables might affect the bitcoin economy in the future. Nobody does, we just have different reasons to believe a certain prognosis.
So, yeah... I guess it's a matter of opinion, and my opinion is that it's still pretty much an experiment. Sorry for ranting on so much, just wanted to blurt out my thought process on bitcoin at the moment. :)

The circlejerk here is much too strong for sound comments to get through. The worst of the Bitcoin nerd community just came out to play with pitchforks and there's little that can be done by reasoning.
I also think that the price for a Live CD is much too steep (should be a tad above CD production costs, IMO, because it is essentially something you can do yourself for free after a few hours of googling). However, even with that caveat - this entire thread is unwarranted.

It can be used to buy reddit gold, for example. Although, I suppose, reddit could be classified as a drug too.
