Yep, so what your arguments now? Nothing, eh?
@_date: 2018-09-02 14:22:50
Haha yes, for sure.
So CSW wrote a paper about problems for electronic contracting aka smart contracts one year before Satoshi released his paper about bitcoin and you're saying, it has "absolutely no relation to bitcoin". kek

So in April 23 2011 Satoshi said: "I've moved on to other things." Three years later [2014]( CSW got "involved in bitcoin", despite the fact he knew about "bit coin" wayback in 2011.

So please tell me the difference.

7 years ago (2018 - 7 = 2011) Thank me later...


**He faked** *x* because he [really wants the world to think he isn’t Satoshi](


Same as above


False. 


False. "bloody" "03/Jan/2009" 


So what. He want to hide he's Satoshi. Best practice here.




So he can't be Satoshi? kek

He even wrote a paper about electronic contracting wayback in 2008.

So a smart contract is not a electronic contract? Hahahahahaha

He even wrote a paper about [electronic contracting]( wayback in 2008.
@_date: 2018-09-02 14:16:32
Wow you read that paper in 10 min?

So in April 23 2011 Satoshi said: "I've moved on to other things."
Two years later 2013 CSW got "involved in bitcoin", despite the fact he shilled "bit coin" wayback in [2011](
