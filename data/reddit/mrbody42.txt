There's things like Shift Card that make it really easy to do. I've got a card, but haven't made a purchase yet. I'm considering funneling my entertainment budget through it. If it goes down, don't go out and see a movie that month. If it goes up, take the extra and store it for later.

I had my accounts on GDAX and Coinbase locked for about a month, no response from tweets or any real answer from support emails. Just because I tried to add a bank account so I could buy coin easier! 
They better step up their customer support soon

Saw there was one in my area, got hyped. Friends and I went to try it a couple weeks ago when market was around $3.5 k, the ATM price was ~$4.2k. Plus, the UI was so unresponsive and non precise it was impossible for me to create a PIN code, couldn't type the same thing twice. 
Really great idea, but the poor execution really turned us all off the idea

Customer service is almost non existent so far. My account was disabled from trading for 4 weeks with the only reply being "we're looking at it." Never told me why it was disabled, never told me it was fixed.

It makes a super delicious bread/cake that my roommates eat so fast I barely get any myself :P

This one has to be BYOC (bake your own cake) because I'm stuck inside due to stupidly late CO winter weather. Happy Birthday!
