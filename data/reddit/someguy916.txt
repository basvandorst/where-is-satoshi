Ok, so you can believe me or not, PM me and I'll give you my number so we can talk in person, but, I'm telling you, if someone stole 70mil there are people who would give him up for less then that, that's life

So say in a hypothetical situation if someone stole coins and try to cash out what price would you put on them snitching on them? Everyone has a price in my opinion
@_date: 2016-08-10 03:31:14
You are good, lol, I deleted all my posts because I don't want anyone to know who I am
@_date: 2016-08-10 06:13:11
Wtf, I don't use okcupid, I'm on match, you are weird, lol, do what you want but don't freak me out

Ok so say someone knows who is the hacker is, what btc would you offer to give him up?
@_date: 2016-08-10 05:14:24
That sounds about right, I'll offer them that if bitfinex does not respond

If you knew your friend stole the coins what would you pay to snitch on him?
@_date: 2016-08-10 20:04:24
thank you
@_date: 2016-08-10 03:11:15
I have no idea who the hacker is but I know who to ask if they would snitch on him for a certain price
@_date: 2016-08-10 07:19:50
I sent you my number in PM and you didn't respond, let's talk, when you got time
@_date: 2016-08-10 06:26:59
Um, ok, if you want to check my history go ahead, no idea why but go ahead, your weird, lol, all I want to know is the btc amount they would pay for someone to snitch, I have no idea what you are doing but that all I'm asking

I am having the same issue, I submitted a support ticket, people are saying you have to wait about 3 days then the coins will just show up, hopefully.
@_date: 2018-01-07 00:12:53
what did you do to fix the problem? Did you open a support ticket and thats it? It showed up after 3 days from you opening the support ticket?
@_date: 2016-08-10 02:18:51
I would snitch if the price was right.
@_date: 2018-01-07 00:11:56
what did you do to fix the problem?
@_date: 2018-01-07 00:17:05
Did you open a support ticket and then 3 days later it showed up?
@_date: 2017-11-18 06:50:59
