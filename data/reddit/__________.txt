People can and will speculate over nothing, and there will always be someone to make money of off them. If you assume individuals are rational in financial markets, you're in for a shock. When you hear banks make money in the markets, it's not really because they are investing, it's because they are in the middle letting people do the weirdest things while cashing their fees.

The Fed issues just shy of $1 trillion of Treasuries each year. Within a few days the Fed would be forced into high yields issuances just to be able to settle on its existing obligations.
The value of the debt would also not change the way you are thinking about it. The price of treasury may only drop 15%, which *grossly over simplified* mean the Fed would need to borrow at 15% interest rate in the markets. It would make zero sense for the Fed to refinance 2% debt with 15% debt. Again, gross oversimplification but that's the gist of it.

I'll bite. What is the interest rate setting process for Bitcoin? No interest rate, then no forward price, then no spot price stability, then no store of value, then BTC is not a currency. I'll be waiting to be downvoted or banned.

I have just realized I wrote a very long wall of text, but please to read through it is really important people understand how and why these things matter. 
If I want to buy BTC with USD today, you will charge me the spot rate. Now if I want to buy BTC with USD in a year but agree on the price today, aka a forward price, we need to find a way to determine what is the discounted value of each currency. Usually we will make (broadly) the assumption that I will invest my USD at USD base rate for a year, and you will invest your BTC at BTC base rate for a year. The reason the baseline price is calculated this way is because failing any better option this is what each participant will do.
Let's arbitrarily say the spot price is 10,000 or 1 BTC = 10,000 USD and there are Central Bank issued Treasuries with US interest rate is 2% and BTC interest rate is 1%. By making this investment in 12 months, you will hold 1.01 BTC and I will hold 10,200 USD. The forward price is then 10,222 or 1.01 BTC = 10,200 USD. 
The problem with BTC not having a Central Bank is that there is no equivalent to Treasuries, therefore there is no minimum guaranteed interest rate amd no guarantee you will receive your funds back. And that's a significant problem, because unless you want to bear an unknown risk and potentially large losses, you will need to find a 12 month investment with a guaranteed return. From there, you have two options:
*  Invest within the BTC to not be exposed to BTC price movement. You may be able to lend your BTC to someone, but because there is no BTC Treasuries the price is 100% dependent on their credit risk and there is no guarantee you even receive you BTC back. The return will be highly unpredictable.
* Invest outside of BTC and expose yourself to spot price movement. Frankly with the volatility that should not even be considered an option.
In both cases, you will have to protect yourself against these risk by demanding very high returns to make up for the risk of losing your investment - really that's how any investment is priced.
What this means is that when I want to execute a 12 months forward BTCUSD, I will get unpredictable prices,  no way to evaluate if my counterparty will be able to survive until the settlement, and likely incredibly high hedging costs.
Granted it is an exercise in futility and shouldn't be taken at face value, but using available information Bloomberg estimated the BTCUSD implied rate at [57%]( What this means is that to hedge a $100 investment in BTC, I will pay $57 a year in implied rate. Within less than two year, the cost of hedging is greater than the value of my investment itself - which makes hedging completely pointless. To give you a feel for it, the highly troubled Argentinian pesos implied rate is hovering around 30%, while EURUSD is at around 2%. 
Without reasonable cost of hedging, it is impossible to take anything but very short term commitments on any currency. Without long term commitment to a currency, it's spot price will wildly swing up and down making it a horrible thing to hold onto as a store of value or a means to get paid or pay suppliers. BTC is facing a catch 22 problem, it cannot be widely used without stability and it cannot be stable without wide ussage - largely because there is no market wide base interest rate setting process.

Fixed supply without stable demand means nothing. Rarity does not make anything intrinsically valuable.

Gold is by far the easiest metal to work with as it occur in a naturally workable state and its malleability makes it far more technologically accessible than iron or copper which both came much later. Gold was widely used as a metal for millennia and it is that intrinsic value that led Egyptians to use it as a currency for international trade.

BTC will never be adopted as long as its price is volatile. The way currencies spot price volatility is controlled is by allowing for a healthy forward market. And that's a problem for BTC, because forward prices aren't some dude's guess of what the prices will be in x days/weeks/months, it is largely guided by the differential in interest rates. BTC has no official interest rate setting process. Oops.

The value of any currency is based in the whether there will be a demand for it in the future; i.e. it is widely accepted and largely retains its value. Historically people have used commodities as currency. Things that were intrinsically useful therefore valuable (gold, silver, copper, ...). 
It is tempting to think a fiat currency is backed by trust, but that's really not the case. You need to look at what aims to guarantee the future demand for a currency, in the case of the USD:
* A globally integrated economy with a $19 trillion GDP, the (2nd?) largest in the world
* A Federal Bank with $4.5 trillion in Assets
* Tens of billions in foreign currencies and foreign treasuries held and managed specifically to stabilize the USD and US economy
* The world's most powerful military and its allies to protect the above
The USD, US economy, US Fed and US military so deeply embedded with the rest of the world that any orderly dismount of the USD would take decades to not take the rest of the world with it.
This is M.A.D. 101. China could crash the USD tomorrow morning by dumping their US Treasuries and USD reserves; provided it is willing to annihilate its own economy in the process.
For good or bad, the above drives a stable demand for the US Dollar and guarantee its value will remain stable over very long periods of times.

And they are both intrinsically valuable through their industrial use. None of us would be typing any of thing without gold on circuit boards.

It has none of the properties of a currency or a commodity. It's a highly volatile asset.

Numbers are fuzzy but broadly China owns about $1 trillion in US Treasuries and $0.75 trillion in USD. The Fed's balance sheet cannot support that kind of price action on the USD or Treasuries. What you are suggesting implies the Fed issuing high interest debt to buy back low interest debt which makes no financial sense.

Banks market research teams have been writing on BTC for years. They recognize the money is in the technology and not Bitcoin itself, and they are... right.
@_date: 2018-02-18 03:54:46
What do you mean?
@_date: 2018-02-18 04:13:29
Bitcoin is not a currency for many reasons and not the least because it is not a store of value. Bitcoin is not a commodity because it is not an input to the production of goods or services. 
Thinking this is an opinion subject to debate is misunderstanding the properties of a currency/commodity which I why I will not entertain a conversation where you try to relate envelopes to Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-02-18 03:54:19
What do you have besides your opinion?
@_date: 2018-02-18 05:12:12
Distributed ledgers have a lot of application in banking, particularly for inter-bank transactions. Today you need issuer-paying agents, collateral agents, third-parties processing settlements etc. All these things are time consuming and expensive and could very conceivably be eliminated using blockchain technology. Bitcoin will do whatever it will do, but the billions in fees they are paying for these services are real, tangible cost-eliminations opportunities. And that's why many banks have already implemented it.
@_date: 2018-02-18 03:04:17
It's not even a currency, by any definition of it. Not that it will stop someone who misunderstands 'store of value' to jump on my comment.
@_date: 2018-02-18 04:02:52
I did not express an opinion, I stated facts that are independent from me. You hold the opinion that Bitcoin is a currency or a commodity by comparing it to an envelope. That's cool but I am not going to entertain it.
@_date: 2018-02-18 03:08:20
And you rightly say treated like a commodity, because commodities are useful in and off themselves and they have future prices that actually make sense. BTC has exactly none of this.
