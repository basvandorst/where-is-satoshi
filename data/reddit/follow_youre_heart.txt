When I first got into crypto I subbed to both r/bitcoin and r/btc, thinking they were both about actual bitcoin. Didn't take long to figure out r/btc is just a bunch of salty bchabc cultists wanting to trash bitcoin at every turn.

I've had both - and I would pick the Trezor over the ledger 10 out of 10 times. Trezor works perfectly. Ledger had a frustrating UX for me right out of the box. Support was lacking. I just wasn't comfortable with it. I bit the bullet and bought a Trezor and I've been very happy with it.

I know he's badmouthed crypto - say what you will - but Warren Buffet is one of the most successful investors of our time. And I know crypto isn't the stock market. But we have plenty of parallels. I love this quote of his.
"The stock market is a device for transferring wealth from the impatient to the patient."
Keep your hand steady. Don't panic. It's times like these that doing pretty much anything but staring at charts ends up being smart in the long run. Go outside. Hang out with a friend. Watch a movie. Anything but sit and stress and worry about the price of BTC which fluctuates constantly. Adopting a long term perspective makes crypto swings easier to stomach, and ultimately more profitable.
@_date: 2019-07-05 06:38:13
I did exactly what you recommended OP when the price of bitcoin was about 9100. 5 business days later, I was able to buy (the money was taken from my bank account in 1 day...the other 4 were just extra?) and by the time I was able to buy the price had cleared 12k. 
Reaaaally expensive way to avoid fees. Never again.

Winklevii used a series of safe deposit boxes to hide their keys. Apparently they would break each PK into 3, and deposit 1/3 of each into small bank safety deposit boxes. It's a slim chance, but if someone found out which banks they used and hit the right 3 simultaneously, that could be bad for the twins.

I have a Nano S. The bluetooth on the X made me a little nervous - call me paranoid but I just didn't want that to be a possible vulnerability. I'd say my main gripe with the Ledger was that it can only hold a couple apps at a time. So if you had, say, 5 or 7 different cryptos you wanted to keep on there, you'd have to install an app for one, add the coins, delete the app, add the app for the next coin, add the coins, delete the app, and so on. Just really didn't feel comfortable doing that.
The Trezor just worked perfectly from day one and I didn't have to mess with installing or deleting apps. Highly recommend.
@_date: 2019-07-14 13:09:59
I think his point is that the price has dropped quite a bit since the 12th. It sucks that your bank censored you, but at least it was when there was a downward movement, not a surge.

It varies by location, but they're out there. The non-kyc machines I've seen have a $1,000 daily limit *per machine*, not per person. So if someone comes early in the day and buys $1,000 worth, the machine will not vend any more BTC until the next day.

I bet a whole lot of people do exactly that though (leave it on the exchange). I'd like to think I'm a reasonably smart guy and I kept everything on exchanges for over a year.

@_date: 2019-03-26 21:40:11
