I only have Ledger Nano S and am very happy with it. It's a bit cheaper than Trezor and supports apps, which makes it a bit more future-proof (anyone can make an app).

I agree, possible hard forks are what is keeping proper checks and balances between users, developers and miners. We shouldn't be afraid of them.

They have and will keep that power as long as we're afraid of hard forks and controversy. No amount of PR can change that
@_date: 2017-02-04 21:42:29
I agree with the sentiment. I also believe attacking the minority fork can backfire spectacularly. They are playing with fire

I only suggested this would most likely be Finney's and not Satoshi's key. 
Finney said he left a nice stash of bitcoins for his children and that they are savvy enough to use them. I think they opened the safe recently; hack is possible but less likely IMO.

Is it possible you have multiple accounts and the wrong one is selected? What balance does it show on your balance tab? When you send, could you write down everything you see on the screen at the moment of "Insufficient funds"? Can you write your address with majority of funds (can send me PM if you want)?

I like silver too, but don't expect any sustained explosion of value. If there is more demand pushing the price up, there will be new mines developed and will result in more supply. I like silver as an inflation protected diversification only.

It seems to me they "just" misunderstood. By stating you have INR bank account, they assumed you wan't to withdraw to it, not send from it. Bad support!

Totally forgot about HW. If you use crome plugin wallet from manufacturer, you have to trust they won't leak private keys (backdoor in firmware + malicious wallet update); I'd suggest using independent wallet, like electrum or copay. They both support HW.
@_date: 2017-01-04 15:56:25
My own safety ranking goes like this:
exchange (least safe) &lt; web wallet (blockchain.info) &lt; pc wallet (electrum) &lt; phone wallet (mycelium, breadwallet) &lt; paper wallet &lt; air-gapped offline wallet (most safe).

Hardware wallet doesn't do anything by itself, it works together with software wallet. If you use both from same provider (Ledger or Satoshi Labs), you have a single point of failure - malicious employee. You can solve this somewhat by either vetting the firmware or changing the software for third party software wallet (Electrum, Mycelium, Copay).

Hey, thanks! I was using a different account a week ago, when I got a PM from someone offering to do a small job for me in exchange for a small amount of BTC. So I asked him to suggest me a cool username and he did. It was mBTC well spent. You're not him, having a little fun, are you? ;)

First of all, I like HW wallets a lot, I just bought one recently. They are much safer than any other wallet, with the exception of air-gapped computer and/or multi-device-multisig, for which you have to be a serious paranoid geek. I'm just thinking about theoretic vulnerabilities. 
Scenario: there is a hidden backdoor in firmware, which upon knocking with a secret pattern reveals the HD private key. With this key, attacker has access to all funds, Bitcoin and altcoins. If you use third-party software wallet, it doesn't have the secret pattern built-in, so you're safe.
P.S.: there is another theoretic vulnerability, that affects ALL wallets, even air-gapped ones: (malicious) low entropy HD key generation. You can work around it by [throwing dice](

But this isn't a valid BIP39 phrase, because the last word in BIP39 phrase contains 3 bits of randomness and 8 bits of checksum. If you select a random word, checksum will fail and wallet will reject the phrase

This is how I understand: for each ton of rock they get 4.5g of gold, they can process about 10000 tons of rock per day, which gives them 45kg of gold/day. The numbers are still off by a small factor &lt;2

@_date: 2017-04-22 15:32:38
I did that and recommend it. But it's still not safe against corrupt employee, because there could be a backdoor access to private key, implemented in both the firmware and accompanying Chrome wallet. Quite unlikely, but on the other hand, there are big incentives for someone to do that.

I was selling an altcoin for bitcoin, made about 7-8 trades. All trades completed successfully without arbiter, except one where the buyer posted wrong address (bitcoin instead of altcoin). Arbiter solved the issue quickly and buyer got his deposit back. I think it's a smart exchange, but got too expensive due to high bitcoin fees. I wonder, if it could be modified to use Lightning network in the future.
