No I did not. 1PM46yufi8YzyP9NzAR6Y4ks35iCUjGVs4 Is NOT my wallet. It was a SHARED wallet that I created this afternoon to receive my coins Now that shared wallet has "Vanished" from my account. So where are these coins? Blockchain.info has them?!
I didn't invent that address out of thin air and give it to my friend.. how could I?

Here it is: 
So the first of 5 transactions clearly posted to my account. Then the others got lost in la-la land. That's clearly my account. Blockchain will be able to verify this from my IP and that my account created the shared receipt 1PM46yufi8YzyP9NzAR6Y4ks35iCUjGVs4 wallet.
Why oh WHY did he break his payments up!? Why couldn't he send it in one transacation. So what happens now. Where are those "btc"? With block chain.info?!

Update: Ben from Blockchain immediately contacted me and found the coins, explained the mistake I made, rectified and made surethey found their way to my wallet. Thank you Ben and Blockchain. You guys rock.

No no.. I'm sorry.. I didn't mean I'm PISSED AT THEM. I'm just PISSED (more at the IDIOT who was sending me payment and decided to break it up in chunks). And true, I am not their customer.. but I hope they do resolve this.

fingers crossed

Shit! So who has those coins? Clear 1PM46yufi8YzyP9NzAR6Y4ks35iCUjGVs4 was populated for me. i didn't know the sender was going to send MULTIPLE transacations to to me. Is this something they can fix? Ill throw them a BTC if they can resolve this.. thats how important this is
@_date: 2013-10-22 04:28:32
Are you sure about this?
@_date: 2013-10-22 04:20:39
Because 1PM46yufi8YzyP9NzAR6Y4ks35iCUjGVs4 is a wallet that was created as a "shared receiving address" to my account. I got $160.. but not the remaining funds. Blockchain.info support/staff will easily be able to see what I am saying here.

Well I meant all BUSINESS day. But clearly the sender didn't know it was good for only 1 transacation. had I known he wasplanning on breaking it up into multiple payments, I wouldn't have send a Shared address.. rather a normal address. Am I totally screwed.. or will Blockchain.info be able to trace that shared address to my account, have mercy on my senders mistake, and get me my funds?
