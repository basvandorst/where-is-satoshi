You cant see past your nose.
@_date: 2017-12-02 04:35:07
I tried to tell you in the other sub.
@_date: 2017-12-02 21:28:30
I guess it is if you follow this guy.
@_date: 2017-12-02 21:24:48
Like a bar tab?  LOL
@_date: 2017-12-03 02:43:58
Harvesting is already a thing.  See XEM.
@_date: 2017-12-01 04:24:16
LOL, what did you expect?  A tutorial on how to buy on Coinbase?
@_date: 2017-12-03 05:12:59
99% of wallets don’t allow you to set a fee.  Guess your petty comment doesn’t hold up,
@_date: 2017-12-03 05:14:38
You have no clue how stupid you sound.  Carry on.
@_date: 2017-12-03 05:07:39
Or you’re using Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-22 16:15:52
Project much?
@_date: 2017-08-07 22:31:04
Really good actually.  Too bad you don't understand why.
@_date: 2017-08-20 16:40:59
Welcome to 1984.
@_date: 2017-08-21 19:39:13
The price move for LTC was based more on BTC's issues. 
@_date: 2017-08-22 16:36:23
The same can't be said for core.  
@_date: 2017-08-24 14:06:27
Sure, just kick the can down the road.
@_date: 2017-08-24 15:12:10
If he does, then he's really confused. 
@_date: 2017-08-24 15:13:47
If you can't see what is going on, I can't help you. 
@_date: 2017-08-24 14:31:06
Do you know what sub you're in?
@_date: 2017-08-20 14:42:43
Maybe?  But why diverge from Satoshi's white paper for no reason?
He knew it would be a problem and created the solution. 
@_date: 2017-08-20 14:44:24
Yes, the hacked people don't realize they have been hacked. 
There is term for these people, they are called useful idiots. 
@_date: 2017-08-20 15:39:20
What planet are you on?
@_date: 2017-08-20 15:34:54
I'm educated, thank you very much.  Try not to project so much.
@_date: 2017-08-04 13:29:43
LOL, so easily misled you are.
@_date: 2017-08-22 16:28:25
BCH is illiquid?  Do you even know what that word means? 
@_date: 2017-08-24 13:43:41
Seriously?  Put the crack pipe down.
@_date: 2017-08-22 16:30:06
About as expected.  You know nothing.  It couldn't be more clear.
@_date: 2017-08-22 16:11:41
Yes, this is the new normal.  CoreStreamers think high fees are good.
@_date: 2017-08-02 23:04:15


fake news
@_date: 2017-08-22 16:04:35
You're clearly new to Bitcoin.  Less talk more research.
@_date: 2017-08-02 23:11:59
They are just riding the centralized Bitcoin propaganda train.  95% of these trolls don't have a clue.
@_date: 2017-08-03 21:55:30
This is more likely. 
@_date: 2017-08-22 16:17:36
Oh please great economic wizard, explain why high fees are good.
@_date: 2017-08-04 13:16:10
You are all panic selling, smart money is buying bitcoin cash right now.
@_date: 2017-08-20 14:46:49
nope and it never will be
@_date: 2017-08-21 18:17:03
I had to quadruple check and I'm still not sure what sub I'm in.
@_date: 2017-08-24 13:37:51
Segwit was the fix, oops.
@_date: 2017-08-03 21:57:53
@_date: 2017-08-24 15:45:15
Nah, I'm good.  I'll let you guys figure it out the hard way.
@_date: 2017-08-19 15:08:00
Yeah right
@_date: 2017-08-03 01:34:39
He's one of the trolls who doesn't have a clue.
He doesn't realize segwit is just a bandaid and doesn't fix the underlying problems with Bitcoin.
Much to the dismay of most on this subreddit, Bitcoin Cash is a new coin and it will compete with Bitcoin Core.  The free market will decide who wins.
@_date: 2017-08-03 13:26:14
Its really simple, if it doesn't happen Bitcoin will not be adopted by the masses.  So yes, of course it makes sense, but only if you want Bitcoin to be adopted my the masses.  
@_date: 2017-08-21 20:05:43
Be prepared, he is going to run for President.  There is no fucking way we can let that happen. 
@_date: 2017-08-24 17:18:34
@_date: 2017-08-04 13:11:37
You will regret your decision 
@_date: 2017-08-20 14:38:35
"So why would I care about making transactions faster or cheaper?"
Is this a serious question?  
Do you like to lose a large percentage of your money in a transaction fee and wait long periods of time for confirmation?
@_date: 2017-08-20 14:36:00
Yep, he basically vindicated the "one crazy guy".  Can't make this shit up.
@_date: 2017-08-21 20:00:50
I'm buying the dips, there is nothing to fret about.
@_date: 2017-08-22 16:38:55
Fellow pede, you're on the wrong side.
@_date: 2017-08-24 14:19:13
High fees and slow transactions are the new normal for BTC.  It has nothing to do with Bitcoin Cash.
BSCore wants high fees, they have amazing economic knowledge.  Just trust them.
@_date: 2017-08-02 22:38:18
this subreddit
@_date: 2017-08-02 21:43:53
What if all there are more suppressed buy orders?
One this is clear, Bitcoin Cash isn't going to die anytime soon.
@_date: 2017-08-02 22:34:11
a lot of projection going on here
@_date: 2017-08-20 15:16:20
Wow, the delusion is strong in this one.
@_date: 2017-08-07 21:47:59
Good job vindicating OP. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 19:37:00
The wallet has both BTC and BCH.  People in this thread are losing their minds over the default.  
@_date: 2017-08-03 17:04:53
Yes, but if you can't buy coffee with it.  It will never happen.
@_date: 2017-11-21 18:03:38
Free beer tomorrow...
@_date: 2017-11-22 15:29:10
Classic projection. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:38:05
I do every day.  I don’t do echo chambers.
@_date: 2017-11-28 14:11:47
It’s an irrelevant fact in a pathetic attempt to discredit him.
@_date: 2017-11-24 00:18:27
Useful idiot detected.
@_date: 2017-11-23 13:21:11
That's not how it went down.
@_date: 2017-11-26 23:51:16
Yeah, core doesn’t like the “cash” part of the bitcoin white paper.
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:46:19
Says the redditor for 2 days.  LOL. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 23:52:28
He clearly meant it to be a peer to peer electronic cash system.  
@_date: 2017-11-13 23:51:40
Yikes!  This theory is more insane than the Russia collusion theory.  
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:36:44
True 
@_date: 2017-11-21 14:25:52
I'm not randomly referring any law, I was responding to someone who clearly doesn't understand law.
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:17:52
Not hostile, just stating facts.
@_date: 2017-11-21 18:02:35
@_date: 2017-11-22 15:42:21
Projection confirmed, carry on useful idiot.
@_date: 2017-11-21 18:23:57
@_date: 2017-11-21 18:26:58
Nothing comes up
@_date: 2017-11-23 05:31:18
I'm okay with the 2x failure.  Not sure what you're on about.
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:33:49
Bitcoin went parabolic and was way overbought.  It’s now in a downtrend and will stay there for at least a few weeks.  Could be wrong, but I doubt it.
@_date: 2017-11-28 12:29:28
He talks about it all the time.  It’s not a secret.
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:06:04
Blessing in disguise.  We’re going a lot lower.
@_date: 2017-11-28 17:32:13
Oh no a misled pede.
@_date: 2017-11-23 13:55:22
Let me know how that works out for you.
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:27:00
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:46:26
@_date: 2017-11-22 15:47:39
Exactly 
@_date: 2017-11-22 15:43:08
I'm aware
@_date: 2017-11-21 17:53:39
Actually it was a question, that I answered.  I'm very calm, are you projecting?
@_date: 2017-11-22 15:32:35
LOL, I bet you pay more than you have to in taxes every year too!
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:00:50
Right now?  Not a dime.  Major correction in progress.  
@_date: 2017-11-27 17:29:31
Because Core is trying to change Satoshi's vision of a cash system to a "store of wealth".
@_date: 2017-11-22 15:44:19
When you make ridiculous claims, the burden of proof is on you.  
I'm demanding you do research instead of talking bullshit.  I've done the research.
@_date: 2017-11-28 12:31:03
This post says so much about this sub.  Too bad most of the sub is too stupid to understand what it says.
@_date: 2017-11-23 14:11:08
LOL, you are so desperate.
@_date: 2017-11-22 15:47:13
Yeah, still waiting for some actual evidence. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 19:34:22
Of course they know, that guy is full of shit.
@_date: 2017-11-21 18:00:17
People are sheep
@_date: 2017-11-06 22:53:10
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:48:59
LOL, jokes on you guys.  The fact that you think I started it just shows how foolish you are.
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:52:16
Nah, I’m good.
@_date: 2017-11-20 19:37:47
It's not
@_date: 2017-11-21 18:33:12
Ah.  Your post history explains why you can't answer a simple question. 
You also don't know how quotes work.
@_date: 2017-11-23 14:03:57
This sub is cryptos version of r/politics. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 19:39:43
The law is the law and you don't understand it.
Unless you think Core "owns" Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 17:27:05
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:29:42
LOL, so much fail.  Who is trusting Roger with their money?
@_date: 2017-09-07 20:01:51
You heard wrong.
@_date: 2017-09-01 15:27:43
Gotta fix the fees first.  That's what is pricing people out.
@_date: 2017-09-07 20:02:34
No it didn't.  Nice try though. 
@_date: 2017-09-01 16:24:05
It only takes your first purchase to figure it out.
@_date: 2017-09-07 18:13:55
This is the take of a simpleton.  Must not have heard of Moore's law.
@_date: 2017-09-02 22:14:13
How about you ask the person who gave it to you?  Surely they know what's what.
@_date: 2017-09-01 04:32:30
What if you just trade for other cryptos and never change to USD.
@_date: 2017-09-01 04:30:37
It will be $10 when that's the most someone is willing to pay for it. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 16:00:01
Volatility.  Beware the dead cat bounce.
@_date: 2017-09-15 16:00:01
Volatility.  Beware the dead cat bounce.
@_date: 2017-07-01 20:00:51
If BTC was priced at $5,000 right now, would you be profitable?
@_date: 2017-06-15 03:59:06
Is exodus a good one?
@_date: 2017-06-15 16:32:37
Just a correction, everyone chill out
@_date: 2017-06-15 03:36:09
Hahahaa!  Took the words out of my mouth.
@_date: 2017-06-26 17:25:03
Use LTC
@_date: 2017-06-13 22:05:43
We are in the late stages of stealth / early stages of awareness. 
@_date: 2017-06-15 21:37:10
You should probably follow up, I joined after that.  It took 6 days to get verified.
@_date: 2017-06-11 05:10:23
Obviously the founder of Bitcoin.
