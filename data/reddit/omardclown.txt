I live in a neighborhood where you can leave your door open.

The entire idea that we are going to create a robust web experience by locking up offenders is silly. I don't know what the answer is, but I know it isn't jail time. I think the onus is on the creators to make their material robust.

I'm tech savvy, and in the parlance of our times, I'm not sure what the distinction is between virtual and digital. If you said that ebay is a virtual marketplace versus a digital marketplace, nobody would bat an eye.
