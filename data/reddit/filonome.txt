I will. Idc if i go to jail it just means free housing and space to continue my yoga work.  Did u know u can get high by doing yoga? I spend hours a day just sitting completely still anyways doing that. Jail would just make it easier. Plus id feel good knowing they wasted more resources to track me down. Since i dont have an official address and move around constantly.

Thank you kind madam/sir! :)

Why pay taxes? Fuck giving money to terrorists to kill brown people all over the world. 
@_date: 2014-01-16 02:40:06
im not sure of the best way to briefly summarize, but it has to do with the fact that any successful corporation will inevitably face competition. in the setup of anarcho-capitalism, there is no room or mechanism for ANY regulation, so when threatened, the company and its competitor start chatting. first it's exchanging threats. then their numbers men, each respectively, get down to brass tacks and figure out a merger is in the best interest with least risk and most future for both parties.
so, that happens once. then it happens again, and again. and again.
eventually you have a central bank. it won't be called that, but the effects are the same and all the actions are as well.
@_date: 2014-06-04 05:59:57
reproduced problem here as well.
also, no addresses will load. 
example: 
when i try to load my address that way, it just shows the front page of blockchain.io
also, blockchain android app having the same issue but at least it still shows balance...
something is wrong with a server over there. hopefully, they are aware and will fix this soon.
someone with twitter should maybe dm blockchain folks about the problem so we know they are aware.
no tweets about any issues as of right now (1:00 AM central)
@_date: 2014-06-04 06:02:50
so you're part of blockchain and are aware of the issue? i assume so from your post and that makes me feel better that someone has noticed who can do something.
@_date: 2014-01-16 03:32:21
no. its game theory.
@_date: 2014-04-24 18:54:54
For me, and I suspect most other users, yes they do. But perhaps think of the potential this has to pull people into bitcoin that aren't current users. Then, once they have some familiarity, they can work to demand direct acceptance. 
@_date: 2014-04-24 18:52:51
No details yet but I suspect you're right. I doubt it'll be as low as the no fees it costs to use bitcoin without using a debit card...
@_date: 2014-01-05 04:05:44
Let me know if you need help :)
@_date: 2014-01-04 02:44:10
lol like they have any way to enforce payment of income on bitcoins....
@_date: 2014-01-16 02:42:48
i have studied anarcho-capitalism. i hate it because it requires captialistic ideals and relies on corporations to run things. i much prefer anarcho-syndicalism 
you know the heart of the difference? capitalism...
edit: first paragraph of the wiki: "In an anarcho-capitalist society, law enforcement, courts, and all other security services would be operated by privately funded competitors rather than centrally through compulsory taxation." 
idk how anyone can think this is any different than what is happening RIGHT NOW in america. most of the funding of the law enforcement, courts, and security services today is provided through drug confiscations and other black money. NOT majorly through taxation.
@_date: 2014-02-16 02:35:34
Lol k
@_date: 2014-01-16 02:10:47
no. anarcho-capitalism relies on setting up corporations to run public infrastructure. the whole theory ignores the fact that this necessitates centralized banking. you cannot have corporations or anything resembling them without central banking.
@_date: 2014-01-16 00:11:11
they do. lots of anarcho-capitalists don't understand this. same with libertarians. it's a large problem.
@_date: 2013-12-14 01:10:59
right, and they cannot even do that. they can only write laws. that's all.
for an illustration of how laws do not control: speed limits. now no one speeds anymore cus there are laws against it. right?
@_date: 2013-12-13 22:45:01
I think they are irrelevant. Again. You don't understand bitcoin. All they do is affect dollar exchange rate. Wooooo. Doesn't matter. Not the point of bitcoin.

it is just as wrong as i think.

so i wouldn't feel comfortable espousing details of how to live, because i have a tendency to subversively influence people. i think it's unkind.
@_date: 2013-12-13 20:25:28
you seriously misunderstand the goals and long term end-game of bitcoin. i have warned you this is not a path worth taking, but go ahead. i fully encourage dumbass capitalists to fuck around with cryptocurrencies and try their hand profiting from them using the usual scams that have propped up fiats historically. go for it.
@_date: 2013-12-15 18:01:29


no. that's not true. you can trade your labor for compensation under a myriad of economic systems. capitalism describes ownership of the means of production. that is ALL.
i have lots of rebuttals but if you refuse to understand what capitalism is you won't understand them, either.
@_date: 2013-12-13 17:32:38
No fuck off, you greedy capitalist.

Oh man I love jerky. I should buy some....with bitcoin. :)

i know, cus you're a dirty capitalist. 
@_date: 2013-12-24 18:45:56
Yeah costs for this rig aren't much better than roll your own, hence why I stopped using it so much. So anything that allows easy refill with eliquid, you tho k that'd be better? I'd rather not pay more than 50 for the stuff minus the liquid, any you'd recommend at that price level?
@_date: 2013-12-15 10:36:08
To help end capitalism.
@_date: 2013-12-15 22:54:55
there is not any time for that. not now. if you are serious about wanting to help with the next way, i will have need for help in about a year if you are still available.
@_date: 2013-11-29 04:19:47
this is so wrong. i went to school for CS at two different top universities and have friends at 4 others that also go for CS (and 2 have graduated like me from stanford).
this is not the case for CS. they all LOVE open source.
virtual box is used in almost all the schools i have friends at.

i know, and i HAVE an ecig (one of the ones where the cartomizer is within the cartridge with the oil/nicotine and you screw them on to the battery) 
i just wanted to find an option to avoid using power (i live off grid).
that said, what site do you recommend for cheap shipping of cig2o type cartomizers?

Setup a wallet on blockchain.info and you will see a link for a button for donations which you can easily add to your site. Hope this helped!

Don't have any.

sure thing! do you have any web development work or programming projects that you need help with? i also teach advanced yoga that gets you high--for hedonists.
i would take copy-writing work, but i have my hands full at the moment.

And they should be. This current materialist paradigm cannot persist. I will end it.
@_date: 2013-12-15 01:18:53
i mean, be real, they would certainly grow in power just as corporations have today--and now we are supposed to have had a state to check them!
anarcho-capitalism not only allows for but requires private corporations to compete. trust me, monopoly is what happens.
@_date: 2013-12-15 18:41:18
Lol no. Pearls before swine. Go ahead supporting capitalism. 
@_date: 2013-12-14 23:43:24
people don't like true responses when it shows that there are other ways people can live and subsist that are so different from their chosen lifestyle. it's fine. i'm very used to it on here.
@_date: 2013-12-07 07:45:56
i'll take them off your hands if you want to ditch em :)
@_date: 2013-12-15 21:42:04
fine, assume it doesn't exist. like i said above, you do not even understand what capitalism is and so it would be a large waste of my time to explain the plans to destroy it that are underway.
@_date: 2013-12-13 22:47:31
Price is entirely irrelevant. It only serves to convince dumbasses who don't know math and cs well enough to understand that bitcoins are valuable. Other than that, irrelevant. 
@_date: 2013-12-09 18:26:34
Really? Ok...
@_date: 2013-12-14 23:52:31
When I am done with a stay somewhere, or towards the end, I just gather money for gas. I do not keep insurance on my car. If I were to get pulled over I'd get a ticket I assume, but I wouldn't pay it and that's that. Not recommended for everyone. I simply just refuse to support the state so I minimalize my use of cash and disregard their rules. I am aware this is illegal and if some state agency wished to they could imprison me. I have accepted this and am fine with it whether it ever happens or not. It's better in my opinion than working a wage job. I'd rather live and travel and help people. Not work for money that I have to give back to the same large corporations as everyone else. No judgement. Just what I do for my life. 
@_date: 2013-12-15 21:25:07
lol, not what i said at all. what i said was you are wrong, i have a better idea, i am executing it, and you can do and believe all the propaganda that you want.

i do this....seriously. i work for pennies on the dollar undercutting programmers, web developers and copy writers. 
pay me in bitcoin for less than you'd pay anyone else doing those things AND i donate half of my income to charities.
also, i don't require payment until after completion of work that is satisfactory to the customer. 
@_date: 2013-12-14 01:05:31
yes but the number and frequency of new technologies increases and thusly the adaption from governments becomes a larger problem.
@_date: 2013-12-13 22:49:55
Price is irrelevant. 
edit: to help you understand. USD and euro are different currencies. the value of each is set independent. the exchange of them fluctuates. saying that the "price" of a bitcoin in USD is important or has any relevance is like basing your whole idea of valuation of the dollar on the exchange rate to euro. except it's even more retarded because bitcoin is not centrally backed.
@_date: 2013-12-15 18:59:31
you're wrong. but do as thou wilt.

happened in august, idk why people are running this story now...
@_date: 2013-12-14 21:59:01
  
if and when i rarely desire something outside of food and shelter, i do jobs like i mentioned above for small amounts of money and use that (but i always donate half of what i make).
edit: it's funny that people are downvoting this. to each their own i guess.
@_date: 2013-12-13 20:29:57
the intersection of the set of people who see any value in having mainstream security and the set of people who have any decent holdings of bitcoin is 0, nil, null, zilch.
@_date: 2013-12-13 18:39:41
the whole point of bitcoin is to get away from anything resembling the existing financial structure. you can try this, but it won't succeed. you've been warned.
@_date: 2013-12-14 01:06:29


probably true. because the people that waste time attending those things do so because they want to learn more about bitcoin. 
people that use bitcoin and understand how it works and how the value of it is derived do not need to attend those things.
@_date: 2013-12-14 20:45:44
nope. but many people seem to think so. that's fine by me cus it causes me to only do work for people who are, like me, not really concerned about money. :)
if someone wishes to pay more for something i would do for much cheaper, that's their right.
@_date: 2013-12-14 01:08:14
i am certainly in the minority. no one really seems to understand the end-game of the bitcoin roll-out. but if you understand math and CS, and have read through the source code and the original WHOLE 8 PAGE paper that "satoshi" wrote, you would understand what i have been repeating over and over today to you.
@_date: 2013-12-15 01:27:15
yup, not really close to any other ones though, on a ranch in the valley near the sangre de cristo mountain.
@_date: 2013-12-15 01:04:38
above, i noted how i do work to get small sums of money. i find these tasks on and -- i assumed people reading were intelligent enough to carry that knowledge over into the next post, but i guess not, so i apologize. by "gathering money for gas" i was referring to working projects and helping people learn things in exchange for bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-12-14 01:04:42


no. no they don't. they have a PRICE of that. the value is fixed and inherent to the system that backs the distributed ledger of the bitcoin system.
again, you do not understand CS or math well enough to truly understand this. 
so, please, go try to do whatever you want to profit off bitcoin. see how well that works out for you.
@_date: 2013-11-22 02:17:16
Makes sense I guess
@_date: 2013-12-13 23:17:18
one of the best signs of the beginning of a singularity is the inability of world governments to keep up with and understand new emerging technologies.

@_date: 2013-12-14 21:59:40
lol. really, no.
@_date: 2013-12-15 01:01:21
not a fan of anarcho-capitalism. i think it focuses too much on the formation of companies to compete for providing services in place of the state. perhaps necessary for a more wide scale approach to anarchy, but i do not personally agree with the idea that there should be a wider order (like what would be generated by the winner of the corporation who gets to be the courts). instead, i think localized communities would do, and you don't need large services like courts and law enforcement for that. i also do not think any form of larger society can exist without petroleum, and we are running out. so, currently i'd have to say i support anarcho-syndicalism while we are on the road to a world without petroleum. then when we get there, people's consciousnesses will be able to adjust to total anarchy from the available systems others have built up.
@_date: 2013-11-29 00:37:34
LOL what?
no way in hell. they indoctrinate finance majors into keynesian economic voodoo so hard. 
IF bitcoin is brought up, high odds on it being to compare it to a tulip bubble and propagate against trusting it.
neo-classical economics ONLY throughout all university economics courses. where the numbers are made up and the real world is irrelevant. 
from wiki
Neoclassical economics assumes a person to be,
"a lightning calculator of pleasures and pains, who oscillates like a homogeneous globule of desire of happiness under the impulse of stimuli that shift about the area, but leave him intact."
so according to neocalssical economics, no one is using bitcoin because it assumes "People have rational preferences among outcomes that can be identified and associated with a value." and bitcoin "has no inherent value." 
that's what i mean by neoclassical economics ignores the real world. OBVIOUSLY there are many people who use bitcoin.

it's not very high functioning to resort to the same inelegant insult every time you disagree with someone on reddit.
name calling, in general, is typically a sign of low intelligence and poorly controlled emotional response. you know, characteristics of...i guess you'd say, retards.
