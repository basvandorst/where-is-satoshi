so...they get to act like they are supporting the core, all while they steal the alternate coins created in forks and sell them?

except btc has a limit, there is not infinite tulips here ;) and the demand isnt going away. 
You are free to not buy bitcoin, but coming her to flame people who do is childish. go home loser

My bet is they will keep their BTC and sell their own currency. If b2x wins out ill eat a hat on livestream.
