Yes, it was free. Xotika works by donations. The model wanted 200 mBTC for a show, and that amount had already been reached when I made the thread. Hence, why I put the word FREE in the title, to make it clear that the show was starting and that it was free.

Who are you to decide that? There are all kinds of dumb merchants advertised on this subreddit, and many of them end up on the front page. The merchant I linked (Xotika) is a platform for adult entertainers that has true potential, and actually offers benefits over the incumbent cam sites since it uses btc instead of fiat. Everyone who has visited the specific channel I linked enjoys the girl who is there.

And whose fault is that? Yours.

That was the point of the post. It had nothing to do with advertising this model, just advertising a great site via a great model to provide a good experience for new visitors. AND it was a free already paid for show, so I can't imagine what you're actually complaining about here. Notice I used the word FREE in the title.. that is not called advertising a model to funnel more BTC to her.

Yes. It shows the site in live action, with a model that is exceptional. 2 BTC been tipped to this girl last 2 days alone. Demo is better than skeleton of site.
