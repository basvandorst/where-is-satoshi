Actually, you'd have to pay me (for the deep emotional trauma) to watch those pictures!

"Thousands of people" kept using MtGox because of the higher exchange rate, despite clear signs of troubles. "Thousands of people" were driven by greed, instead of common sense. 
Will MtGox fall affect Bitcoin world on a catastrophic level? I really doubt it!

"MtGox's 'new office' is literally a VIRTUAL office!"
My reaction reading this was as simple as: "So what?" They stopped being relevant about a year ago except for market manipulators through mass hysteria. They were no longer even an exchange, since fiat was close to impossible to withdraw. I still wonder who kept BTC or fiat in there...

Bitcoin will stabilize once the whales are gone. And the whales have no intention to move to something else. If some whales get out of the business, others will replace them and play the same media hysteria game over and over again, always making profits.
Take for example SR, China banning BTC and, lately, some obscure and outdated exchange that no vaguely informed bitcoiner was using anymore going down. Whales were ready for all these events and they will use all media channels to amplify the result as long as there are profits to be made.
And the same whales will pump the next bubble, just to pop it at the right time. It's the way of a "free" market, it's the way of Bitcoin.

Yes, salt.

Well, one must notice the significance of the last 3 digits of the last Bitstamp price :)

I keep asking myself why an alt coin is getting so much attention on the bitcoin sub-reddit. Maybe I'm missing something, but I don't really understand people willing to replace bitcoin with a new ... "bitcoin" just because they feel they missed the bitcoin boat and hope a new alt-coin will provide them with a "get rich overnight" scheme. 
I do believe bitcoin is just on a very early phase, it will grow again above many expectations and it will leave the alt-coins way behind simply because all these crypto-currencies need social consensus to exist and the society will be looking into stability and therefore, into as few as possible crypto-currencies.

"The good thing about these swings is it cleanses the market of the schemes and flakes. Bad actors and shallow investors are squeezed out. Ponzi's are left exposed. The weak are ran out and only the strong remain to press on. "
I read all above as "don't worry, a new bubble will come until the new generation of the afford mentioned categories will punch the bubble and break it again... and so on", which (the statement) I actually agree with.

Wait, price is going up now... Will this help those that sold low?

I'm not in the US, but I have a question after reading so many comments like "do not sell your btc once you bought them if you don't have a .. whatever license". Are ALL the US btc buyers mandatory holders (or hodlers if you like it this way)? I mean, seriously, you guys make it sound like once you bought some btc's, you're forced to hold them forever or at least until the laws change and a license is no longer required to sell them... Somehow, I have a feeling this is not what really happens there, right?

Are we sure they accept bitcoin? I think they accept USD converted from bitcoin deposits, right?

To reach gold value, a bitcoin should be worth aprox USD 360k. I did this calculation few years ago based on wikipedia info regarding the current amount of gold existing in the world and the price of gold at that moment.

You could use blocktrail.com API

This! Would really like these 2 questions answered. While your website "trading" operations can only work with that bank account unfrozen, the BTC withdrawal part should work independently.

To sell HIS BTC and pay EUR back to customers holding EUR balances, I agree. To sell MY BTC for the same reason, I don't. As long as he has enough BTC to pay all BTC balances (the correct ones, not those resulted from stolen funds or trading bugs), he should just do that. As for the EUR balances, there are legal ways (maybe very long ones) to recover your money.
