A true currency distributes quickly so that all the coins are spread out before people learn to game the system and the mining centralizes, as with Bitcoin.
And Dogecoin cannot die, for we have the one thing no other cryptocurrency has had before: a soul.

It is logic which insists that the experts have the highest probability of being right, as they are more knowledgeable and smart. Therefore if you were rational you would listen to the expert and cross the street with your eyes closed. And if experts agreed that we should have gone to Iraq back then, then it was the rational choice to think it was right for us to go. And if experts think the opposite now, then it is now the rational choice to think it was wrong for us to go. And you cannot claim 100% chance of wronghood, as there are logically possible alternatives which could make them right. Furthermore, as to experts being right more of the time, let me quote myself:
"We may probabilistically conclude that non-experts have been wrong more times than experts due to the average expert by nature having more knowledge and being smarter than the average non-expert. It is irrational to assume otherwise given those traits."
Next time actually address the argument when it is made, so that I don't need to quote it to you.
@_date: 2014-05-22 21:26:31
My answer is implicit in my previous responses: Less goods, as that is the answer in line with inflation, and it is thus the rational choice. For you to choose otherwise is irrational, for the reasons I previously described.
@_date: 2014-05-27 14:22:55
You're making us both sound like broken records, as you've once more responded with appeals to emotion and preference, and the same argument I've already refuted and which you obviously cannot rebut since you just keep repeating it without countering me. Surely you can do better than this.

@_date: 2014-06-25 20:15:40
You once again fail to make counter arguments and you repeat sentiments made in previous comments which I've already addressed and which you haven't counter addressed. Either it is your English comprehension skills which need improvement, or you merely are afraid of admitting defeat.
Now, as I already explained and you didn’t address:
“Nothing is truly provable as all logic leads back to initial unjustified assumptions.” 
You may either take this to heart and make no arguments about anything anymore, or you may do what I do and which I once again already explained to you and which you didn’t address:
“There is no such thing as a non-assertion, as you would need an infinite regression of supporting evidence to not ultimately be asserting. All you can do is continually give supporting evidence upon request until the other person stops needing it.”
Furthermore, I agreed that **if** my system ultimately had mankind end up in caves, that it would still have been the rational choice to follow that system, as it would have had the least likely chance of having had mankind end up in those caves. And the same logic may be applied to crossing the street and paying more for things, as I’ve explained multiple times to you. And again as I’ve already explained multiple times to you, there is no need to give you a reason why paying for things will make you wealthier, as we have the testimony of experts who say it is the case, and who it would be irrational to defy given their smarter and more knowledgeable selves.

You look both ways to gauge the probability of a car hitting you. If you are not thinking in probabilities, but in absolutes, then you are being irrational, as there are logically possible alternatives available, such as you having hallucinated that no car was there when there really was. For you to demonstrate that you aren't in fact irrational, you must now show how it is the only logically possible scenario that there is no oncoming car which will hit you as you cross the road, when you do so. If you cannot do this and continue to maintain your position, then again, I will take this as an admission of defeat. The truly magical thinking is yours, where you disregard logic and as an extension also empiricism, in the formation of your beliefs.
@_date: 2014-05-22 17:46:29
Premined coins and super long mined coins like Bitcoin are the two extremes which get it wrong. Dogecoin is the balance between them, and it is balance which we want in the spread of coins.
And inflationary money is the economic consensus on the best way for money to be. To endorse a deflationary coin is like endorsing the Earth being flat. Sure, you might have a few economists on your side, like there are flat earthers today, but it is working off of consensus which is what pushes humanity forward into utopia.
@_date: 2014-05-24 07:01:47
I countered your argument with the argument that the probability is greater that that the consensus of experts and smart people is right, rather than you or me. To think for one's self in this instance (Not all, as this argument is me thinking for my glorious self) is the irrational choice, as my argument proves. You responded to this argument by making irrelevant appeals to emotion and preference (You don't like not thinking for yourself, omg Hitler, etc.), and things which my argument already directly or implicitly refutes (Scientists thought flight was impossible, etc.); and then admitting that you cannot refute it; and then declaring that you don't need to refute it. So, my rejection of your argument is done through rebuttal and reason, and your rejection of my argument is done through the abandonment of reason.
If you wish to return to the table of reason, then move past your biases (Going "omg you're not thinking for yourself" over and over is not an argument against it.) and present a rational argument which refutes my argument about consensus. Any of these other "rational arguments" that you wish to present and which you irrationally think that I would irrationally reject, are already refuted by my aforementioned argument, which is why I would rightfully and rationally reject them. If, as you said, you can do nothing to present your arguments, then that is the evidence that they have been defeated.
@_date: 2014-05-25 07:39:23
Again, more appeals to emotion and preference. I take it that the reason you have to appeal so hard in this manner is that you truly cannot rebut me. Oh well, another truth glorifying victory in the bucket.
@_date: 2014-06-23 07:19:38
Repeating myself again, your examples do not matter, as there will always be more examples of a common person being wrong than those of experts. And experts could argue that they don't have different goals better than you could argue that they do. Again, it would be nice if you attempted to refute my arguments rather than repeating the ones I already rebutted. And furthermore, any evidence you think you have about inflation obviously wasn't enough for the experts to change their minds, and so it is not sufficient evidence, if evidence at all.

@_date: 2014-05-26 10:20:03
Now you're once more restating an argument I already refuted. For however many times the consensus of experts is wrong, there are many more examples of the non-consensus of experts being wrong; and if you were to claim that they are influenced, then they could make a better argument that they aren't influenced, as they are smarter and more experted than you are; and then they may turn it around and say that you in fact are the one who is influenced. 
You need to either accept this, give up, or come up with a counterargument; and speaking of counterarguments, quoting "emotion and preference" is not an argument against your use of those things as arguments. I think you need to cool down and come back and look at this with calmer eyes. You're obviously very invested in not being wrong about this; it's palpable in your words.
@_date: 2014-06-24 05:28:34
As I've proven, you've merely repeated statements which I already refuted, in response to my refutations of those statements. Furthermore, you still show that you cannot comprehend probability. If you lose on a bet made with a 70% chance to win, it was still the rational choice to choose that option, rather than the bet with a 30% chance to win. Again, if you don't wish to lose you have to actually respond to my arguments and not merely repeat yourself.
@_date: 2014-05-24 07:46:07
Again, my argument already implicitly refutes what you said, as it is probabilistic. Consensus of experts/smarter people isn't always right, but it's the most likely to be, and so for every example of them being wrong you can come up with, there are thousands upon thousands of examples of some random non-expert being wrong. It is through reason that I have decided that both of our reasoning is not important as it concerns economics. And it is the highest expression of the importance of overall reason to be able to use it to make such decisions, as it shows an awareness of self that through its lack blinds the reason of all others.
Once more you engaged in the things I previously described. Do you have anything else, or is my argument left unrefuted and therefore victorious?
@_date: 2014-05-22 19:44:50
Consensus isn't always right, but it's the most likely to be right. And so no matter the case, so long as the smarter and expert people are in consensus about something, then you and me should listen to them. So it doesn't matter which option I think is better for me, because smarter people know what's better for me better than I do. And it is the same for you. Thinking for oneself at all times is merely arrogance.

Indeed reason triumphs, which is why you cannot refute my arguments, and why you must once again resort to mere declarations of “Nuh uh”. Not only would my sentence be rational in this universe, as I have shown, but also in all parallel universes. And not only is your system irrational in this universe, but also in all parallel universes, as all possible parallel universes would still be bound to being logical, which your system is not, as I have shown. Furthermore, thinking for oneself is the more comforting thing, as it fulfills the ego; but in the name of truth and rationality we must we must rise above that vice. Also, it’s not that something must be true because experts tell us so, it's that it is the most likely to be true.
@_date: 2014-05-23 05:43:52

@_date: 2014-06-25 19:19:26
I see you’ve once again written a paragraph of theatre in an attempt to mask that you have no counter arguments to make. All you did was make multiple differently worded declarations of “Nuh uh” while not providing an argument for why something is “Nuh uh”. I’ll just counter this by lowering to your level of debate and say “That paragraph was absurd.” And now that I’ve dispatched of your response, if you wish take part in actual debate, and wish to make an actual and relevant counter argument, please explain to me how those who go to and graduate from college are not more likely to be smarter and more knowledgeable than those who do not; and please explain to me how you would be more likely to make a better argument about the agenda of experts, than experts who are smarter and more knowledgeable than you are.
@_date: 2014-06-24 21:32:35
Nothing is truly provable as all logic leads back to initial unjustified assumptions, and all things are probability so long as there are logically possible alternatives. Due to this, my way of running the world is the only rational way of doing so. We may probabilistically conclude that non-experts have been wrong more times than experts due to the average expert by nature having more knowledge and being smarter than the average non-expert. It is irrational to assume otherwise given those traits, and given this, my claim is in fact correct and if pursued would have the highest probability of having the greatest outcome. 
Thinking for oneself in this instance is the least likely to be rewarding, as I have just shown.

@_date: 2014-06-26 09:27:10
Again you're ignoring the arguments I made in my previous comment and are merely repeating the sentiments made in your previous comment, all of which I have addressed and you haven't counter addressed. My system is the most likely to lead to correct conclusions, and yours is the most likely to lead wrong conclusions, as experts say that this is the case, and they are the most likely to be correct. If you wish to counter this argument, I refer to this quote:
"please explain to me how those who go to and graduate from college are not more likely to be smarter and more knowledgeable than those who do not; and please explain to me how you would be more likely to make a better argument about the agenda of experts, than experts who are smarter and more knowledgeable than you are."

Of course one who is feigning humor after an embarrassing defeat would say that he actually thinks this is funny, but the most rational conclusion is that you actually don't, and are really masking emotional turmoil from that defeat. Furthermore, your admission of defeat has already shown that you have been convinced, as since you cannot come up with a counter argument and have had such a reaction to that inability, it shows that you are most likely to at least have subconsciously accepted that I am correct.

If closing your eyes and crossing the street has the highest chance of avoiding being hit by a car, which is when I would recommend doing so, then obviously you should do so. To not accept this, is again, to be irrational and to disregard logic. You are choosing to take a greater risk of being hit by a car. If this is truly what you wish to do, then take ownership of that irrationality, and say that you wish to take the greater risk. Otherwise, accept that you have been defeated, and accept my position as the truth. Those are your  two intellectually honest options.
And again, experts would say that higher prices would ultimately make you more wealthy, and they are the most likely to be correct given that they are smarter and more knowledgeable. So for you to choose lower prices is irrational. Furthermore, as probability dictates, it is your system which has the higher chance of having kept mankind in caves. So once more, it is irrational for you to hold your position. 
It is indeed easy to determine which method produces the better outcome. As I have just shown, it is mine. And I'm still waiting for you to rebut any of my arguments, but it seems you're far too invested in your position to be able to truly question it.
@_date: 2014-06-23 07:21:31

This is false because by logic at some point someone knows the most. And what could possibly be ridiculous about listening to someone who is smarter and knows more about a topic than you? To not do so is what is ridiculous.
And again, no matter how many times the experts were wrong in the past, they are still the most likely to be right, as non-experts were wrong in the past more.
@_date: 2014-05-31 20:36:19
Once more you repeat yourself without addressing my rebuttals. You've done this like 10 times now my child. You need to realize this. I chose A or B (The inflation option), I rebutted the statement about expert motivation (They're smarter and more experted, so they could argue against that statement better than you could argue for it), and I rebutted your giving of examples where experts have been wrong (There are more examples of non-experts being wrong).
If you don't want to lose, you have to actually refute my arguments, or at the very least attempt to do so. Just posting large paragraphs of repetition doesn't hide from me that you've actually said nothing.
@_date: 2014-06-26 10:07:29
Once more you repeat sentiments already addressed and not counter addressed. As to unprovable premises, to quote myself quoting to you:
*Now, as I already explained and you didn’t address:*
*“Nothing is truly provable as all logic leads back to initial unjustified assumptions.”*
*You may either take this to heart and make no arguments about anything anymore, or you may do what I do and which I once again already explained to you and which you didn’t address:*
*“There is no such thing as a non-assertion, as you would need an infinite regression of supporting evidence to not ultimately be asserting. All you can do is continually give supporting evidence upon request until the other person stops needing it.”*
Now please address this argument this time, if you would.
Furthermore, no matter how readily available any evidence is, the opinions of experts remain the most likely to be right, as the evidence you speak of is just as available to them, and they are the most smart and knowledgeable. If you wish to counter this argument, then as I said, explain how they are not the most likely to be smarter and more knowledgeable given that they went and graduated from college, and if you accept that they are smarter and more knowledgeable, explain how this doesn't make them more likely to be right than someone who is less smart and knowledgeable; and if you bring up their agenda, then explain how you could argue that they have an agenda better than they could argue they don't have one, given that they are smarter and more knowledgeable.
Also, during Galileo's time, it was indeed the most rational to believe that the Earth was flat, as experts believed such, and thus it was the most likely to be correct. You may not like this, but it is the case, as I have shown. And that experts were wrong in the past, as with Galileo, matters not, as non-experts were wrong more as we know by experts being smarter and more knowledgeable as evidenced by their going to college.

@_date: 2014-06-26 17:34:27
Once more you do not address the arguments made in my previous response, and again you resort to repeating your sentiments, making differently worded declarations of “Nuh uh”, appeals to preference and emotion, etc. Everything you said is false as it may be shown that listening to experts is the rational choice due to them being smarter and more knowledgeable and thus being the most likely to be correct on things. To quote myself again:
“If you wish to counter this argument, then as I said, explain how they are not the most likely to be smarter and more knowledgeable given that they went and graduated from college, and if you accept that they are smarter and more knowledgeable, explain how this doesn't make them more likely to be right than someone who is less smart and knowledgeable; and if you bring up their agenda, then explain how you could argue that they have an agenda better than they could argue they don't have one, given that they are smarter and more knowledgeable.”

There is no such thing as a non-assertion, as you would need an infinite regression of supporting evidence to not ultimately be asserting. All you can do is continually give supporting evidence upon request until the other person stops needing it. So to do just that: We may probabilistically conclude that experts are more knowledgeable and intelligent than non-experts due to their greater likelihood of having graduated from a college, and a good one at that. If you are being intellectually honest I believe you will accept that experts are more likely to have gone to college, and that the average person who goes to college is more intelligent and knowledgeable than the average person who does not. 
Now, as to this agenda business, I shall quote myself repeating myself to you about this very issue after you didn't address my response, and which you still haven't addressed since and now bring it up again:
"I rebutted the statement about expert motivation (They're smarter and more experted, so they could argue against that statement better than you could argue for it)"
So experts, given their expertise and intelligence, could argue better that they don't have an agenda than you could argue for it, and so thus it is the rational choice to believe that they don't have an agenda.
Once you understand these things you'll see that it was rational to support invading Iraq before and not now, and that you should indeed cross the road with your eyes closed and choose inflation if experts recommends it.

As I said, consensus isn't always right, but it's the most likely to be right.

It would be more likely to be hit by the truck if one did look out for it rather than listening to experts, so your scenario isn't indicative of reality, as I have shown.

So indeed, I take this as your admission of defeat.

As a defender of truth it is my job to be spirited and determined. And what experts tell us is what is the most likely to be reality, and that is why we must follow them, as I have shown. I'll take this non-argument of a response to mean that you truly cannot refute me.
@_date: 2014-06-24 12:29:29
Once again you fail to comprehend probability. Even if humanity ends up in the cave, it was still the rational thing to make the choice which put them there if that choice had the highest chance of success and thus avoiding the cave. I imagine you do understand this, but your pride will not allow you to admit that you are wrong. And this is a prime example of how you do not make arguments. I’ve explained to you numerous times now how the choice which lands humanity into caves is rational due to it having the highest chance of success (And I've explained why it has that chance), but you ignore this, and merely continue to repeat the same sentiments you made in the comment I was responding to. This has been the case with all of the things which you claim I have not addressed. I have addressed them, and then you’ve responded to all of them in the same manner as with the cave scenario. That is the difference between my claim that I’ve already addressed your arguments while you have not addressed mine, and your claim to the opposite. My claim is correct.
Now is your chance to realize what you’re doing, and change it. Explain how it is not rational for humans to make the choice which lands them into caves, if that choice had the higher chance of success and thus avoiding the caves, than any other. And if you don't accept that the choice of listening to experts is the choice with the highest chance of success, then explain how that is not the case even though non-experts have been wrong more times than experts.
