Why do you hate bitcoin so much? It's the foundation of the entire sector. It's the underlying value driver - and the beating heart of the community without bitcoin none of this would exist. You seem to have a very strong agenda why all the hate?

LOL spending money that is appreciating at 10% a week is the stupidest thing you can do. Bitcoin will only be money when its speculative growth slows down - and to be fair the transactions are quite slow. Why would i buy groceries today with something that will be worth 10% more next week - I suppose with that mindset I would never buy anything.  I wish I had been one of those fucks that chose (with some complicit bosses) to be paid in bitcoin back in 2013. They are all laughing now. Although I would never buy anything - just sit on my pile of dosh

HAHAA wrong - bitcoin only crashes once enough people say "to the moon" - this is the opposite - basically my prediction is 10 000 before december. To the moon

you question the concept of immutability - not the protocol itself - do not mix the two - people are the problem, not the protocol
your argument is ultimately philosophical and unfixable - we can either have immutability or we can have censorship - we cannot have both in the same universe
your time is most likely up - blockchain will win

This exact scenario happened before, the 2014 bubble was China speculation and then official statement from the Chinese government as I recall...

But its pointless to have a private blockchain, open source MySQL is better than that.

premining... Thats how - when the platform is mined privately before opening to the public. Its not fair that the one person does all the easy mining and leaves the hard work to the public.
