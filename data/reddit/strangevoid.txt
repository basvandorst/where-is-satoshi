It’s not even a pyramid scheme in the technical sense. STOP USING PYRAMID SCHEME TO COMPARE PEOPLE!  Similar to hot new technology companies - founders/older employees/investors of successful tech companies that have IPO’d can make loads of profit from selling their shares to new consumers/retail investors.  Would you call THAT a pyramid scheme? Or just basic supply and demand? With increases in value due to public perception?
Bitcoin isn’t a freaking pyramid scheme in any sense. -_-

Heard from an app developer about this. He couldn't talk too much about it because of the NDA he signed for the project he was working on, but yeah. He said apple was going to be releasing their own payment system and that the app he was developing will be one of the very first to use it. Something along those line. We'll see.

So basically if you're past 20, you're not gonna have the capacity to understand how BTC works.

"BITCOIN, totally untraceable."
This is forever going to be an inside joke.

Lol I thought it was a reference of cam winklvoss repeatedly saying "SPARTANS HOLD" when he did that AMA last weekend. I guess he was referencing Aprils post lolol

I read an article that stated how there was a small percentage of people who own a large percentage of the amount of bitcoins out there. How does that make you feel?

Did this today at my local coffee shop. Planted the seed in their minds, hoping they will hop onto it! It would definitely help with marketing, with the whole bitcoin news wave going about right now.

Love you for this.
