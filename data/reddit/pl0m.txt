Can someone curbstomp me please?

These are the type of guys that are in head of anyone and could easily manipulate the market if  they want. Once they done that we have the retail investors screaming to "HODL" because they are scared to loose their hard earned money.
@_date: 2018-01-09 19:04:36
shit the price is going down now thanks to my post
@_date: 2018-01-07 23:06:54
Of course we should have sketicism sundays. It would be healthy for this delusional community that's haussing the bitcoin price everyday.  All i can see is posts like "to the moon", "buy now before its too late" etc.  If there are questionmarks or skepticism we should be able to answer those questions without any problems.

It was on 1k dollar 2014 already.
@_date: 2017-12-17 16:16:32
It can only change if we free ourselves from valuing it in FIAT.. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:25:59
You bought for money you cant afford to loose right?  If thats the case then sell it right away. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:09:43
Well spoken. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 15:50:53
What you don't see is that as long as you value Bitcoin against FIAT currency, you are not FREE from FIAT currency.  Seems you missed the point big times kiddo. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 16:15:14
Yes i agree totally and i've been in the cryptocurrencies since 2013 when i was trading litecoins and bitcoins but at the same time we are not free from FIAT, when we value it in FIAT.

Investors most likely since they are more aware of how minifutures actually works.
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:06:58
Looks like they will tease you in just a few months. Nice concept though
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:07:42
Yeah to bitcoins but im a veteran in stocks and investments unlike you. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 15:53:55
Where's your argument? I promised myself to not argue with idiots that has a 2 numbered IQ. Have a good day kid. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:31:30
My reasoning behind the surge on "thanksgiving" ( which i have no idea what date it is since im not a US citizen ) is that it have nothing to do with the day or weekend itself. The news started at this time to spread about the bitcoin price increase which lead to many low-income investors to take a shot at it. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:43:10
Sorry i didn't know it was sarcasm. It's hard to spot the difference in such a delusional community. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:40:27
You think grandmas 50 pound will make a difference? So delusional.
@_date: 2017-12-17 15:55:09
You tried the opposite already.
@_date: 2017-12-17 15:44:38
Your lack of context means your post is totally useless for me. If you wanna criticize me, do it properly and have some constructive feedback in it. Otherwise it makes you look like the dumb one (no matter what mummy told you). 
@_date: 2017-12-18 17:23:17
When indian guys are talking about BTC  you know its right the time to sell. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 17:22:29
Yes it's true.  What we had in the glorious old bitcoin days were libertarians believing in this no matter what the value was. The community has since then changed to amateurs and low income "investors" like agent9747 to earn some easy FIAT currencies. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:02:45
I like the fact that you're estimating the price using a fictional "tool". It says a lot about you and the rest of this community.
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:03:30
My tea leaves indicates that you are only relying on price guesses.
@_date: 2017-12-18 17:26:02
It seems you're not so well educated either. What undeveloped country are you from? 
@_date: 2017-12-12 02:54:24
What you thinking of is ESEA. They were mining through their clients which is needed in order to play CSGO on ESEA servers. They were caught red handed though and had to blast it off with a pathetic excuse.

You have reached the 5th stage in grief and loss - Acceptance
@_date: 2017-12-17 17:25:25
I heard of bitcoin back in 2009, i started to buy it in 2013. You are totally missing the point in bitcoin as it was intended for in the beginning.  You're an amateur investor valuing the bitcoin in FIAT currencies to try and grab some cash.  Im a libertarian believing in the actual currency while not trying to earn FIAT cash from it.  Humans are greedy and dumb, you're just another living proof.
@_date: 2017-12-24 15:23:55
Yea its wex.nz nowadays. I still have my Litecoins in there even though they had to close down in august under btc-e.com 
@_date: 2017-12-17 15:48:20
What you don't see is that as long as you value Bitcoin against FIAT currency, you are not FREE from FIAT currency. Speaking about living in a little box :)
@_date: 2017-12-17 12:18:25
I tried to laugh but i couldnt.. never seen that meme either tbh
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:44:21
Yes it will. Congratulations
@_date: 2017-12-15 02:04:48
If you have never traded in futures before i strongly advice you to not do it. You will need years of experience in stockmarketing at first. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 19:01:52
What could i say? You are mediocre and you're the same decaying organic matter as everything else.
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:28:24
Thats what all haussers in all stocks says for hoping to bring in more investors. "When it sinks to this i will buy more". Never listen to that biased sh*t talk
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:40:33
Its way too late. 2013 at max was early.
@_date: 2017-12-17 15:49:48
I have promised myself to not argue with idiots. Must be harsch having a 2 numbered IQ quote. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 17:19:09
You want to live in a world free f rom fiat with decentralization. Yet you still speculate in FIAT currencies for your fairly small bitcoin amount. How are you supposed to believe that it magically will happen one day if you're not starting to do anything? 
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:49:01
Theres many similar cases. Its the same as with the IT bubble in the early 2000's. Research on Christen Ager-Hanssen
@_date: 2017-12-17 18:59:26
You just answered my question that you are a sheep and "doing what everyone else is doing".  You're also refering to gaming consoles so i assume you're a kid/teenager too.  Sadly your answer wasn't enough to please my intelligence so i just leave it there.
@_date: 2017-12-21 23:15:38
I guess i'm just into kids you know. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:58:04
I just have some empathy for people. Its an attribute you rarely see today :-)
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:37:16
Thats what everyone says in hyped stockmarkets etc.  The big whales are the ones driving the prices up. As soon as they sell off the price will not rise but go down fast. Ive been trading stocks and CFD's for the past 5 years and i've seen and learned enough to avoid such scenarios. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 13:29:01
I always giggle when i see someone who think they know anything about investments trying to enlight people. But it's just a text that makes no sense at all. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:53:13
How much would you have earned if you sold 2 days ago?
@_date: 2017-12-23 21:17:31
Ironically you can't pay with cryptocurrencies.
