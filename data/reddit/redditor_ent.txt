Thanks, but I live in a rural area and the closest merchant on there is like a 4 hour drive.

Will do; thanks for the advice.

Finally someone who understood the anonymous part. I have a TORmail email address, can I use that? I tried to get myself a Hotmail address while using TOR but it required Java script to be running.

So I could just contact them and ask if they're willing to send me them via bank transfer?

But I have an account with the .onion retailer and they gave me a code similar to this: 1DdwNJJScFXLbgFLysuf4qBx6v9PoTu788 to deposit into and from there I can buy goods. So do I still need a wallet or does my account with said retailer count as one?

Can I use a TORmail address for extra anonymity?

If it's not already obvious I want to buy bitcoins to purchase some products from a .onion retailer through BM. They gave me a deposit address witch is something like:"1DdwNJJScFXLbgFLysuf4qBx6v9PoTu788". 
So, can I simply go to my local TD branch and tell them I want bitcoins? I'm sorry for making you explain everything to me like I'm five.

Okay, I got my wallet, now what is my next step? Like how do I purchase the bitcoins for my wallet? It has several options on there like "bank" deposits but asks me for to verify via SMS and I don't have a cell phone.

No, sorry. I just have a bank account and cash. 
@_date: 2013-01-25 01:52:00
That didn't work.

This sounds like the most hopeful option so far. 
I have an account with a .onion retailer and they gave me a code similar to this: 1DdwNJJScFXLbgFLysuf4qBx6v9PoTu788 to deposit into and from there I can buy goods. I was wondering if I needed  a wallet still or if I could just follow the instructions on cavirtex for a cash payment and give them the code for my account on the .onion retailer?

It's not. I just took one and modified it a bit hence why I said "similar".
