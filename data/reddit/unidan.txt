What's your criteria for "something new"?  I'd argue almost all knowledge and science is through accretion.

I've made a few already! :D

Mine is a synthesis of behavioral ecology and ecosystem ecology in a new hypothesis with almost zero publications.  Is that okay, haha?

Experiment.com can set up your project to directly accept doge, that I'm sure of.  I'm sure if you wrote in to them, BTC would be just as easy to manage, but I can't speak for them.

Howdy, thanks!

There's a comedy fund?!
Is there a science fund?  I could push bitcoins into my research!

[Here's a Bitcoin developer from Bitpay who spoke at the same event that I did.](  He got a kick out of the fact that I was going to speak about dogecoin, for sure!
I use Bitcoin, too, it's just been a bit more difficult to get integrated into the bitcoin community since I think a lot of people are using it as stock at the moment.  To be fair, so were our projects that we were trying to get funded, but I think the doge community was just a lot more "free" with their currency, which likely contributed to the success.

Much appreciated, by the way!
@_date: 2014-04-06 17:07:09
Haha, thanks a bunch, that's very kind!
@_date: 2014-03-07 16:31:42
Haha, ah, jeez.  Capitalize my fake last name, at least! :D
@_date: 2014-03-07 17:41:33
Haha, we're all about humor in my group, no worries! :D
Thank you so much!

I think people have different ideas of what that means, unfortunately, so what I think is a paradigm shift in my field may not exactly meet your criteria for something like "cure cancer" or "unlimited energy" or something like that.

[Here you go!](
@_date: 2014-03-07 16:09:23
Haha, no sweat!

Haha, ah, jeez, thanks! :D

I actually cashed out my BTC at the 1,200 mark!  
Not that I had much to cash out, but I'm glad I did now!  
I redeemed my karma for BTC when I had probably 150,000 or so?  There's a cap on it, but man, I'd convert it now! :D
@_date: 2013-11-25 07:01:25
This looks awesome, great job, dude!

It was real, I just forgot that the verification doesn't show up unless you specify it! :(
