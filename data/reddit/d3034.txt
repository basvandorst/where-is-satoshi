yeah but I first got going on the way up to 20k at around 11,000 bought at 13 15 17 then 15 14 12 10 9 8 7  lol.  My average btc price is probably around 13k if I had to guess.  I feel like I will see 50k BTC at least eventually, so i'm okay with it.   The more i've messed around with it the more it feels like a superior currency to the dollar/banks.  I would be sad to see crypto disappear altogether.   If someone could hack the bitcoin protocol itself and double spend or create out of thin air without mining that would kill crypto for some time.  I really don't believe that will happen for a long long time if ever.   If that did happen, it would be shitty day, because as it stands now this stuff has some world altering potential in my opinion.

I kept buying all the way down as well.  My fomo, was more from missing out on the discounts.  It did get a little sickening there towards the very bottom haha.  In a weird way tho I kinda hoped we would go as low as 3k.  I only regret buying too frequent on way down and missing the rock bottom 6's range from running too low on funds.  Congrats to those who got in that low and even lower in years past.

Not to mention, the bitcoin.org website Brovada sent me to to read about it, looks almost identical to the way it did back then.  So believe the second time around when I was reading about it again on there in late 2017, I could vividly remember the night I was so close to setting up a wallet and buying some coins like 3-4 years earlier.

I'm holding out till at least then, its not that far away, I just have to see what it will do to the price (curiosity).   Seems only logical that it will have a major positive impact.  
@_date: 2018-05-04 05:08:38
That's actually what most chart experts kind of recommend.  confirmation of a recovery/bull trend before you jump in .  I just like Bitcoins so much I don't really mind any price below 10-11k.   I could be terribly wrong, but I just feel like the 2020 halvening will be huge.   I got to keep gradually buying until at least then, its not that far away.

Nothing to be down on yourself about, this stuff is the most unpredictable thing i've ever seen.  It's scared the hell out of me at times.    I personally just for some reason feel like I need to hold some for good while longer.   Could be dead ass wrong tho lol. 
@_date: 2018-05-09 05:36:40
I mean I hope so.  I don't know what will happen, but just using basic logic and simple math, how could it not have a major positive impact?  Other factors added in being, even that much longer that Bitcoin has been around and working, resulting in increased public trust.... the increase of inflation/debt by that time and probably some other events we couldn't even guess right now.   Also it seems like any governments would be fools not to be at least dipping their toes into this stuff considering its gold like qualities.  Its gonna break 20k.   I could be dead ass wrong but its just that once I finally understood what it was, it was like the craziest feeling that I had to start collecting as much as I could get my hands on.   As far as long term savings go, I prefer BTC to cash, but I have a kid and can't go all in as much as I would if it were just me.   Honestly,  I freaking love buying BTC and moving it into the old ledger and seeing the total rise,  and would have a hard time selling at 50k-100k  and kind of hope I can just hold out till you can pretty much use it anywhere.  I mean to me,  Bitcoin is right up there with the most genius ideas ever.

Dude, I like to play blackjack, and where i'm from its illegal online, so way back, I was looking into BITCOIN because you can use it on Brovada,  I couldn't quite understand it so I didn't mess with it...  It was literally just a few dollars a coin back then.  Yes I probably would have gambled most of it away, but there is a good chance i'd have a few coins lying around in a wallet If I had just gave it a shot!!   Damn it lol
@_date: 2018-05-04 05:29:31
Kind of off topic but.....I really think that when bitcoin hit 20k that is the real moment that it entered into mass consciousness, and even though its been around like 10 years... I think the real "trust" clock started then for many of us, so to speak.   In other words I think a lot of new people are going to gradually realize that Bitcoin is probably not just gonna go away and disappear.    When it does reach that level again it should go way beyond that the next time around.   Many nay sayers are most likely going to have to take a second look.    Just makes sense to me.

Lol best comment confirmed.

I run a concession stand at fairs and festivals all over eastern U.S.  have already decided to put a bitcoin sign up in the window and have some QR stickers made, beginning next week when the season starts back up.   Didn't even consider people having wildly wrong ideas about it and it being a conversation starter.   The only part that sucks about crypto, is people are just too lazy to learn something as simple as cold storage vs hot wallets, keeping up with a 12 word password, figuring out how to get bitcoin in the first place.... to most people this all sounds like a lot when in reality you could get down the basics in an hour or two.   Yeah there is a few things to learn, but at the same time buying and selling things in BTC could be sooo easy and could spread so fast if more people just start laying the foundations and doing the sometimes painful task of educating.    This post was a great reminder for me to get off my ass and get those btc signs made up.   Gracias.

This is actually a great question that is very important and at the same time puzzling me.  A part of me feels like it might be wise to diversify in BTC and and other store of value things like gold, land, guns maybe even?  The debasing of the dollar is actually rather extreme when you look at just the past 20-30 years alone.  Look back at the price of an ounce of gold anytime during the 80's for example.  It's almost scary that we have to ask questions like this in the first place.  I think it is wise to build up cash mainly for the purpose of investment opportunities and taking advantage of whatever doors that may open to produce more income or assets, but just sitting on it to retire with?  Probably not gonna go too well.  
@_date: 2018-03-23 06:55:55
Yes would be interesting, betting in market vs 1 on 1 money where mouth is.... completely different.

I'm still confused on the tax thing, I've never sold bitcoin period.  But I have bought on gdax, then sent to various wallets each time, now if a transaction is taxed, then as far as they know I'm doing a transaction and I'll be taxed for giving myself my own btc??  I have a hard time believing, that the IRS is going to be able to keep up with all this.  My personal transaction history alone is amazingly complicated, and I've done nothing more than buy, send to wallets and give away a little crypto to family and friends I've tried to help learn.    When I went to France and traded dollars for euros I didn't have to put that on my tax returns, this is really some bullshit if you ask me.

I have purchased btc from an ATM with cash, no I'D requires.  Granted the premium was like 8 percent but still it worked. 
@_date: 2018-03-11 14:26:07
Well as far as I know coinbase charges that same fee to buy no matter how much you buy, meaning buy more at a time.  If you just wire or transfer in money you can buy for free on gdax. But it will take around 10 days before money clear and you can place an order for Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-03-19 13:45:37
The basics, would be purchasing bitcoin.  The only places to do that with fiat that I know of are ATMs,  Gemini or Coinbase.  Your shitcoins are not what I was talking about and I wouldn't consider going that next step as the basics.   But yeah you kind of made my point, the barrier to entry is too high for most idiots.
@_date: 2018-02-26 02:30:28
I wish I knew, I guess it's possible the whole thing goes to nothing, but for some reason I just do not believe we have seen the all-time  all-time high yet.   I have to at least give it until the 2020 halving.  
@_date: 2018-02-26 00:31:19
I always do the opposite,  FOMO into the dips.  Sometimes trying to buy the dip before it's "too late/reversal" leads to buying too early and missing lower entry points.   I also do not understand panic selling.  Too many must be using money they actually need like right now??
@_date: 2018-02-26 09:46:46
I don't know, I wanna see it bounce from right above 9000.   It seems like the price is funneling into a triangle pattern, but all that does is really give you an idea of roughly when a big move up or down will take place.    If it did take one more dip down to 8k I could see that creating some momentum up.    I know nothing about it, I just hope the price doesn't get too low or even more people will get discouraged.  At least as of right now Bitcoin is staying on people's radar and making itself hard to ignore.    But if we did get down to 8k levels and bounce from there Bitcoin would still be making progress since the crash.   My thinking is if there were price manipulation going on the last thing you would wanna do is kill off too much interest.   If not then clearly OP is right, and new believers are here and becoming hodlers. I am waiting/accumulating till at least 2020 halving regardless because I'm just too bullish for that and it's not even that far off.  
@_date: 2018-03-19 17:13:44
This is going on in my family as well, choosing the greedy bankers over a decentralized system, in the name of what's good lol.  
@_date: 2018-02-26 03:48:33
New believer here, since November been buying all the way up as high as 17,000 my highest purchase... and all the way down to as low as 6,500.   Haven't sold the first crypto back into fiat.   I'm sure there are many more like myself that didn't run away after the fall from 20,000, so you may be right.  
@_date: 2018-02-26 14:36:44
Lol somebody wanted some coins.... Immediately!!
@_date: 2018-04-04 23:52:24
No it would be an increase in the value of the money, which is deflation, meaning in that currency things cost less and less, prices of goods deflate.  Inflationary means prices increase. Prices of goods and services.  
@_date: 2018-04-04 23:49:37
As the price increases and btc shows that it will only increase in value over time, the more precautions holders will take.  I agree this problem will take care of itself.
