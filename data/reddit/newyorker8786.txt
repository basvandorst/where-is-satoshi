We need this fast. Hopefully early 2018 its implemented. Im getting sick of the BTC is too slow, too obsolete news.

The White House said in a recent briefing that home land security monitoring bitcoin &amp; crypto currencies so we have to keep close observation on what news will arise ..
In addition a US senate  proposed bill  titled s.1241 that will criminalize the intentional ownership of crypto .. we have to keep a eye on further developments to come 
Of course this will ONLY be a short term draw back if it actually happens 
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:27:11
It should be there by tomorrow .. it takes about 6-7 days .. this is why we love cryptos

Bitcoin is still very young with such a very small market cap &amp; has a lot of growing to do .,. Adoption is still tiny.. 
if you believe in the tech &amp; the future of it then it’s a good investment 
I was telling myself the same thing when I purchased a full coin in the upper 3k range... HODL!

I can’t sleep at night with the past volatility.. I’m super glad it’s slow now 
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:20:02
Don’t do it. timing the market is very difficult .. just buy on the dip .. for instance yesterday, there was never a dip after it busted through 12k .. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 03:51:17
Check back in another 10 mins  don’t worry it will be there

Where were you when it was at 5,700-6k couple days ago 
@_date: 2017-11-01 12:58:32
It’s currently 6,500 it’s 2 weeks to the fork which can easily  bring it to 7k+  losing 2k in value just from a hard fork  with no negative news seems like a pretty unrealistic prediction..   today’s high is next weeks bottom 
@_date: 2017-11-03 22:26:51
No .. whatever hardware wallet you have your BTC in, instructions from the hardware wallet will follow on what to do to safely obtain your fork coins

@_date: 2017-11-25 20:39:43
Gdax, no fee ( same company as coinbase )
@_date: 2017-11-06 19:58:18
Not stupid .. just HODL and you will be perfectly fine. Selling now would be dumb 
@_date: 2017-11-05 15:23:32
The more ppl dump B2x the stronger the message will get across.. we, the btc community opinions matter and effect the market. Once B2x is dumped miners have no choice but to stick with legacy chain.

They will get sued to the moon &amp; back 
@_date: 2017-11-06 19:26:50

@_date: 2017-11-08 13:30:05
Im 100% with core but  I’m very worried with b2x having much of the  hashrate, we could see BTC crash temporarily .. very stuck in what to do either hodl or  sell &amp; wait in the sidelines. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 14:50:22
How do you get to 1 hour post fork ? There’s no replay protection we would be jeopardizing our BTC if we dump 2x so fast .. correct ?
@_date: 2018-03-15 00:56:45
Pack it up, see you at goblin town guys .. 
@_date: 2018-03-12 18:10:48
Jan &amp; Feb historically... it’s now extended into March &amp; who knows how longer now
@_date: 2018-03-16 21:19:36
Just like the ppl who sold “ low “ at 9-11k right ? BTC is still bear &amp; can retest 6k for all we know 
@_date: 2018-03-14 23:35:44
If 8.2k is when Jack is sinking in the water then what scene is when btc eventually goes to 4-5k? The ending  credits. 
@_date: 2018-03-17 00:22:23
Because obviously the market deems 8k is too expensive .. 5k would be a good floor to accumulate and slowly build up the bull run again..&amp; this is certainly not the worst correction BTC has had before regaining momentum... There’s still more pain to be had.
@_date: 2017-09-18 22:09:54

it's a very small bounce with no buying pressure..its not going up.

It's speculative at the moment more news is emerging about mining is the next step but we won't know until we get a confirmation. So just wait &amp; see and be prepared 
@_date: 2018-03-16 21:15:04

That's what everyone was saying at 2k then 3k .. it's always a good time to buy if you are hodling  for the long haul 
@_date: 2017-09-19 14:28:32
That's the million dollar question we will all know very soon
@_date: 2017-09-17 20:56:32

@_date: 2017-09-19 14:31:42
There's recent news that china may escalate by blocking all BTC transactions with the great fire wall so I think there's a lot of people just waiting on the sidelines until this news gets confirmed.

Always store your coins where you CONTROL your own private keys .. hot wallets, cold wallets.  U don't own your private keys on exchanges 
@_date: 2017-10-02 16:18:26
It's best to purchase directly from the companies site .. ledger nano or trezor 
@_date: 2017-10-01 13:33:59
What exchanges will it be on?
@_date: 2017-10-01 23:54:43
So  a Hardware wallet like Ledgar nano S ?
@_date: 2017-10-08 01:47:25
Agree that's the only alt coin I personally would consider along with ripple 
@_date: 2017-10-12 20:54:06
Who knows just hodl .. it will get there eventually 
@_date: 2017-10-13 02:00:36
That's how it is normally they say 3-5 days but it's really 6-7  
@_date: 2017-10-17 02:30:35
He's trolling don't mind him
@_date: 2017-10-02 16:47:46
Exactly .. same here I'm from NYC &amp; I waited about 2 weeks to receive mines directly from ledger site 
@_date: 2017-10-09 01:27:52
I received mines less than the expected date they told me when I purchased it two months ago. It came in like 2 weeks tops 
@_date: 2017-10-24 02:20:47
Any info yet on Ledger nano s? should I transfer btc to coinbase before the fork ?
