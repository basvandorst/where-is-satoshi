Pretty good amount of time to be stable.

Heh.

I have no money until the 20th :-p. I am certainly interested in it though, so if the offer is still valid then, I'll buy some. 
@_date: 2013-11-17 01:17:35
I meant more to put money into it.

Really kicking myself that I didn't buy when I saw them at $5. I was going to purchase two, but never got an account going and now I have none. Glad to see some people are doing really well, especially that guy that paid off his debt.

Has it changed then? When I tried to set it up two years ago I couldn't do it at all.

I know you're just being sarcastic, but it is a legit concern regarding bitcoin since it's so new. Gold has been around forever and has had valuation by humans for a long time. 
It is far from a failed experiment, even if it fails completely soon.

Totally agree. OP seems to really think that this is the biggest and most informed Bitcoin community on the internet.

Can you just disconnect your computer from the internet and do the offline part?

How do you buy bitcoins with a debit card? 
@_date: 2013-11-17 04:47:52
Yes, the BTC has gone up in value and continues to do so at an extreme rate. Anybody refusing to admit this is simply lying to themselves. The USD may be going down, but not nearly as fast as BTC is going up.

No, but if my spending power doubles in that time period and I have knowledge of that, I'd be far more hesitant to spend so flippantly.

First off, this isn't about a sandwich, it was just an example. A poorly chosen one it seems, because all half the commentators can seem to focus on is a sandwich. 
Second, while I'm not saying it's impossible, I highly doubt that a lot of people using BTC are using it as their sole source of money. 
@_date: 2013-11-17 05:32:37
Right, but disregarding trends isn't good.

Not sure what the first one has to do with anything, and isn't the second one solved by PayPal or something similiar? Either way the person would have to have Bitcoin or Paypal, so it'd still take time to set up if you don't already have it.

No offense, but what common situation are bitcoins easier and faster to use than a debit or credit card, or just plain cash?
@_date: 2013-11-17 05:23:23
I can't afford it at this point, plain and simple.
I tried to buy 10 BTC two years ago at $7 a pop, but the process was so incredibly difficult I just said forget it. 
I suppose I could buy some fractions of 1 BTC but I'm not sure I 100% believe in the long-term value of it all.

Not the best example when if it were with Bitcoin, I could buy a much better one in two months.
