As I can agree with you 100% some people want to own it and have it insured with someone else in case something goes south.  Not everyone wants the responsibility or headache of storing a lot of money. Same can be said with precious metals.  I mean you aren't wrong but its kind of why banks exist in the first place.

I think hes frozen.  Wasnt Dorian Nakamoto living close to Hal and he used him as inspiration because he was losing his house in the 08 crash.  Also If Satoshi came back and moved his coins it would tank the market.  The conditions that created bitcoin were in fact perfect.

@_date: 2019-03-06 19:45:24
You miss the entire point of BTC.  That requires us to "trust" you.  Bitcoin is "trustless".  How can I send your toenails across the internet in censorship resistant way?  I get it most people in this space are just degenerate gamblers and speculators.  So this line of thinking gets spouted often.  You have no need for bitcoin right now so it is hard to wrap your mind around it.

Bitcoin is a great short-term and long-term investment.  Long-term is self-explanatory.  The Halvings every 4 years are more and more serious this next decade.  In 2020 the price of bitcoin will have to be higher with only 6.25 mined every 10 minutes, and more computational power being added to the system.  2024-3.125btc will be mined in 2028-1.5625 btc will be mined by 2032 a block will be mining less than 1 Btc .78125 to be exact.  Short term 2020 long-term 2032 something drastic has to happen in that time frame good or bad.  I encourage anyone discouraged by the bear market to hold until 2020 if btc is shit I will just spend or sell.  I cant think of any other investment that offers this much potential in just two years.  The halvings will happen with or without institutional money.

Not in reality though.  A token represents that I own a piece of gold or barrel of oil.  Doesn't actually mean I will own it.  These items have to physically be at a centralized location thus it makes no sense.

@_date: 2018-06-15 16:49:31
Not sure why you were downvoted but that makes sense.  Only 21mil coins, millions already lost or satoshi coins never used.  If Bitcoin for some magical reason was the defacto global medium of exchange the value of 1 btc would be astronomical.  This is where the mental game happened for me.  I could easily afford to lose a few hundred dollars to own one of these coins.  Now we are talking about a few thousand dollars.  In the future, though it doesn't seem very likely from these last 6 months if the price was tens of thousands of dollars this seems crazy.  You dont have to own an entire coin is true but mentally it seems futile for the average person, hence the rise of alts, which is BTC goes back up in a year or so will probably also go parabolic again until one crypto really just becomes dominant for business.  
@_date: 2018-06-27 19:42:01
I think we are missing each other's points.  I am not saying it has to.   I am simply saying crypto is not helping homeless people and neither will I.  The culling has begun.

Holy shit its been over a year in this bear market.  We were hearing the "Next Bitcoin is around the corner" for over a year now.  BTC dominates the dark and grey markets and that's all that matters not buying KF FUCKING C.

@_date: 2018-11-29 21:58:25
Take a breather folks and stock up on fiat.  This is a long game.  Nothing is going to actually happen without a catalyst.  In 2016 you had the halvening and the ICO boom.   We have not had real capitulation yet. Way too many projects still have plenty of crypto and still dont do anything.  Everything else will bleed and BTC will keep on building.  Wait until you have 3-6 months of just flat movement where everyone hates BTC that is when you buy.  Patience is key.

@_date: 2018-07-06 16:22:30
144 blocks a day*12.5=1800 new bitcoins a day.  In 2020 that will be 900.  When the sell orders on these are finally reached to make a profit, and the whales are done trading with each other the price will go up.  This is especially true if the hashrate or how hard it is to mine a bitcoin keeps on rising.  When the demand for bitcoin goes up the supply cannot keep up no matter what you do, more miners only secure the system and make it harder to acquire any bitcoin because of competition thus further increasing the price.  This is why bitcoin is prone to bubbles.  With gold if you have more demand you can increase production and get more gold to meet demand.  This is not true in Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-07-06 16:24:08

@_date: 2018-07-31 16:35:16
Almost half of the volume is just derivatives.  This to me is very bad.  Maybe someone can educate me on this.
@_date: 2018-07-11 15:56:20
People mine alts to acquire more bitcoin though.  
@_date: 2018-07-18 16:17:36
Well if bitcoin is used as money and held like a savings account it would be hard to make fake paperwork.  This happened to gold because no one actually wants to store it.  You are right that it could happen though.  Also, only 20.999 million bitcoin can exist, so the most they can "print" is 21 million. 
@_date: 2018-07-31 21:40:45
Bitcoin though not perfected yet does act like a currency if you need it to.  What helps is just get a little bit and hold for 2 years.  Bitcoin is a deflationary asset that you can now put your inflationary fiat into.  If bitcoin does stabilize with time and capital and becomes more user-friendly with different wallets and lightning it will suck up fiat currencies like a black hole.

And bitgold, egold, and many other online currencies have also failed. And they will all continue to fail if they dont last more than a decade.   This is why the "digital gold" analogy is important.  What other anonymous (as with the creator) decentralized currency exists?  Look at how much Bitcoin has improved in the last decade and will continue to improve.  VISA works just fine as a digital currency that is not the point of bitcoin.

If it has a face or a CEO it will fail.  Any open source innovation can be adapted to the bitcoin protocol.  This is why Satoshi was smart he did everything to keep anonymity otherwise it wont work as well as not move his coins.  Everyone else is just trying to print money.  I think btc at 50k or 80k or something would make Satoshi the richest person on paper.  When this happens you can bet people will really notice.
