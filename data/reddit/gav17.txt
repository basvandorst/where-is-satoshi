How is Bitcoin a US dollar investment when it's a different country?


This right here is when you know the writer knows nothing. He is seeing nominal yields when you should see real yields. Of course that the rate is going to be lower now with 3% inflation when you had 2 digit inflation not so long ago.

Buying GBTC at $3,000 is like buying Bitcoins at $32,620.
 
GBTC at $1,845 is like buying at $20,060. Just buy actual bitcoins if you want to enter the market.
Forgot to mention it, but GBTC has an anual management fee of 2% too.

I never said that I expected bitcoin to behave like a currency I just said that until now it's behvaving like a commodity such as gold. That's pointing out reality and shows that the technology is young.
Those people are idiots as the ones saying those thing here.
Like I said until those two problems are not resolved Bitcoin won't replace the dollar, I think we agree on that.

So Bitcoin is digital gold? Because currency most important function is to be used in transactions.

Why is it wrong to criticise something new and pointing out that until now cryptos are not being used for the intended purpose.
The original iPhone didn't have 3g and was criticized because of it, it didn't make the iPhone any less revolutionary.
It's kind of worring that simple critic of the currency, never said it was useless or even a bubble, provoked reactions such as someone calling me the village idiot.
It will never became a world currency if users don't spend it and Bitcoin can't support the amount of transactions needed for that.

What's the fee on those?

Stocks have value, gold and currency have a price. (Actually gold does have value, but not for 90% of the people). It's not bad thing it's just how things work.

When is this hyperinflation happening? With less than 2% inflation in the last years, hyperinflation seems absurd.
@_date: 2018-06-02 16:12:56
But that's what the poster implies when he talks about hyperinflation. 10% inflation every year over a decade is not hyperinflation. Zimbawe, Brasil, Argentina, Germany and Venezuela today are examples of this.
@_date: 2017-08-18 00:08:00
It is an investment but has no value like stocks have. The same happens with Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-06-02 16:10:21
Your post is talking about hyperinflation, not high inflation.

Who has a net worth of 1 million and has it all in cash? He has a point, the majority of millionaires have only like 1% of their assets (excluding residence) in cash.

The household debt is very low in countries with high inflation because no one is willing to lend money. Mortages practically don't exist in Venezuela and aren't as common in developing countries.

Wat? $10 to 1.8 million? I think he ment 1.8k or a higher initial investment.

Do you understand how CDs work? I can't find a historical data dating 30 years of a single CD that last 6 months. There's a CD market were CDs are bought and sold every day and the price fluctuate minimally. Look up what a brokered CD is.
@_date: 2017-09-15 09:07:41
Anyone here with a broker account can go to the fixed income section of their trading platform and they will have the option to buy CDs. In TD it's called CD Center for example. 
Furthermore there are financial instruments like 1 year treasury bonds that have never seen the corrections Bitcoin has seen in a week/month because it's not technically possible with low duration (as default has not happen in the modern era).
@_date: 2017-09-15 10:08:42
As Brokered CDs can be bought, sold or transferred, they became financial instruments. You don't need a chart for that.

Devaluation creates inflation because imported goods became more expensive. Unless a country starts using Bitcoin as their primarly currency this shouldn't be a problem.

Stocks are somewhat hedged against inflation and you can buy tips if you are preocupied by possible hike in inflation. You can hedge all your belongings against inflation using futures.

If you want repercussions for him, you are in favour of a regulated market. I thought the point of cryptos was the lack of regulations.

An actual free unregulated market isn't perfect, it has it drawbacks. Market manipulation is one of the consequences of this. The only way to stop market manipulation is by government/agency regulation, so if you are against Bitcoin being regulated you are against this person facing consequences.

Apple represents 3.5% of the US stock market capitalization, or 0.09% of the total world stock market. Bitcoin has 50% of the total market cap of cryptocurrencies.

It doesn't make any sense. Inflation is good when "you pay interests" aka have debt with the bank.
@_date: 2018-07-12 19:24:23
If you have a loan at a fix rate in USD, would you prefer:
A. 5% Inflation
B. No Inflation
C. 5% Deflation
Only in scenario A paying the loan is easier, B is the same, and C makes paying the loan harder and harder. Inflation is good for you if you are indebt, at least in that aspect of your financial life.


It's simple maths, no one has to tell me anything.
@_date: 2018-07-12 20:15:29
A deflationary currency will never stop debt. People will take out loans wether they are in Bitcoins, Dollars, another crypto or whatever. There will always be someone with excess currency willing to lend money to someone that needs that currency. Unless you think BTC will change the current economical system in an anorcho/socialist utopia.

Any thoughts on XAPO. From my understanding they will be giving the users the choice what to do. Selling BCC is one of the options and the one I'm inclining to.
@_date: 2018-12-07 22:16:36
Honest question, why does it matter? Is there some kind of arbitrage opportunity created by this? Why would this increase the price and not just lower the amount of people minning?
