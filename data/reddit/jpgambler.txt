FWIW Lightning also has onion routing make transactions from hub to hub anonymous. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:49:41
FWIW both Adam Back and Andreas have said there will likely be a blocksize increase along side Lightning.

Large balance transfer doesn't necessarily mean large fee. It depends on how many outputs you are sending.

yep same as a bank apart from open 24/7, you control all your funds, you can pay anybody in the world, instantly, without needing permission, anonymously in a currency with a controlled supply.

lightning has onion routing, the hubs will not know who sent the transaction.

Andreas said both parties need to be online when they transact.

here you go, this transfer yesterday for 0.000023 showing it is possible.

Proof of Work coins do yes. They might use different hashing algorithms though, BTC uses SHA256, litecoin uses scrypt.
You can mine bitcoin with a pen and paper! [ ... great video to understand what these hashing algos are.

sure you can. here is a confirmed transaction for that amount to their wallet:

Your transactions will be less bytes, so you will pay less total fee.
@_date: 2017-08-29 16:24:58
Yes. It's possible.
@_date: 2017-08-30 03:16:34
It doesn't matter when you switch. What we are trying to say is, when you make transactions from your segwit address rather than your legacy address it will be cheaper. 
@_date: 2017-08-29 16:10:46


you would not have to repeat the process. instead of receiving your newly bought bitcoins at your Legacy address you would receive them at your SegWit address so it would be identical in cost.
@_date: 2017-08-29 16:27:20
You need to transfer your bitcoins from your legacy address to your segwit address if you want to make segwit transactions in the future. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 01:32:02
currently 120sat/bytes are clearing ... which has nothing to do with my original point that new users are unlikely to set custom fees.
@_date: 2017-11-03 16:58:03
and have better capabilities to manipulate markets for their own gain.  
@_date: 2017-11-16 17:48:34
You paid 25 sat/byte,  scroll to the bottom, your transaction is in the green area. You have roughly 9 mb of transactions at higher fees than yours. So when the mempool is roughly 15mb less in size your transaction will clear. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:29:21
Very unlikely new users are setting custom transactions fees and such low custom fees.
@_date: 2017-11-16 17:45:31
When there's less spam attacks. Post SegWit, pre BCH pump and dump have both been high spam. Before pre BCH pump and dump the mempool was regularly empty even with current adoption.

If there is more hashpower inside of of a difficulty adjustment period the network will regularly find more than 1 block per 10 minutes,  every time that orange line is above 1, the network was on average finding more than 1 block per 10 minutes.

The amount of mining power on the BTC chain will have no effect on which chain is more profitable to mine. Until the difficulty adjustment, which if mining power left BTC, then mining BTC will become even more profitable.

You do not need a hardware wallet to own your own keys. You can own your own keys on any wallet you set up on your phone or your desktop. 
@_date: 2017-09-29 13:06:06


What are we looking for in terms of hashpower, block discovery rate and what are the risks and how do they happen? I'd like to be able to understand the risk of no replay protection better. 
@_date: 2017-10-25 20:55:32
and when there are more coins for sale than being bought the price of s2x will decrease and the miners mining that chain will earn less relative to mining BTC, creating more incentive to mine BTC.

The EDA massively increases inflation on the BCH chain. 
When that EDA was active yesterday the inflation rate increased 6x from 0.05 to 0.3. Both chains currently have 12.5 coins reward so without EDA inflate at 4% per year,  but during the period of EDA BCH is inflating at 24% per year. 
The miners are certainly selling those coin rewards to pay their bills, so if BCH change their algo to increase the time spent in high rewards they increase inflation and eventually decrease the price. Thus making the chain less profitable to mine. 
@_date: 2017-10-29 05:09:32


 is a great course. 
@_date: 2017-10-29 19:39:32
and in the meantime the extra inflation makes the coins you hold worth less.

The incentives inside of bitcoin are aligned this way, from the white paper, 
"By convention, the first transaction in a block is a special transaction that starts a new coin owned
by the creator of the block. This adds an incentive for nodes to support the network, and provides
a way to initially distribute coins into circulation ... The incentive may help encourage nodes to stay honest. If a greedy attacker is able to
assemble more CPU power than all the honest nodes, he would have to choose between using it
to defraud people by stealing back his payments, or using it to generate new coins. He ought to
find it more profitable to play by the rules, such rules that favour him with more new coins than
everyone else combined, than to undermine the system and the validity of his own wealth."
The payoff for cooperate is much higher than defect, (use your hash power to mine coins rather than to potentially double-spend). Also we current have a large population for cooperative actors (large hash power) making it harder for a population defectors to evolute.
