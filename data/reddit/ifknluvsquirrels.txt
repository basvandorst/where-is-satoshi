You live in or believe in a fantasy world. Good "luck"

Was the ground floor in your life higher because the system is rigged or was it higher because your father worked hard to make it so? My only point in this is that the system is already set up to provide as much equal opportunity as possible for all people, the fact that that does not result in equal outcome for most is not the system's fault, but the individual.

You proposed a 90% estate tax.

And how do you think big big big fish get so big? They don't start out that way. They start as small fish that are allowed to grow to their full potential in a free market. If every time a fish got too big you cut half of it off and gave it to a class of people who have demonstrated their inability to manage money or create opportunity for others.. you will no longer have any fish

Do you feel that once a person/estate has crossed that $100MM line that somehow means they now didn't earn it?

This is sick. You are a sick person. I'm sorry your father was a lazy shit, but taking 90% of an estate to redistribute it to bottom feeders is the worst idea I've heard possibly ever.

When a man has an idea for a business, puts a plan together, gets investors, hires employees and then runs that business successfully I promise you he is not "ripping off" those employees

Or maybe you could just work harder and make your own money. Nah that would be too difficult, definitely redistribute other people's earned wealth into your lazy hands so you can blow it. Smart
