What like Bitcoin Cash? ;) haha
@_date: 2018-01-08 19:49:31
AKA, segwit took forever to adopt and LN will be viable after 2 years from now. Bitcoin will be dead by then, I guarantee it
@_date: 2018-01-08 21:22:58
I all hear is "It will be hard to imagine the world where we can't manipulate your money anymore"
@_date: 2018-01-03 23:02:14
I didn't want to do it because as I said it would ruin your rep with them. So I stuck it out another week and they returned the funds
@_date: 2017-12-29 13:46:10
Don't get kidnapped now RNdxr
@_date: 2017-12-29 13:42:32
I agree with you. LN is a work around for the problem that is high fees. Shouldn't we use a new coin/update BTCs algorithm rather than build on top of a broken foundation (so that if the price rises so too will fees). Do know I'm biased though, I jumped ship when rai and iota were below $1 so it's easy for me to criticise the pipe dreams of core
@_date: 2017-12-31 04:21:23
My bank manager said they can do a charge back for 25 quid so probably wait till Tuesday or Wednesday and do that if it doesn't come through
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:12:38
Dude this sounds like bs. If you bought at $24 you definitely have the forked bcash from those original coins. Like whAt?
@_date: 2017-12-23 12:55:37
You never know. I sold some coins to diversify in other alts. Selling doesn't mean that person is leaving crypto forever!!
@_date: 2017-12-06 03:06:48
Bitcoin is a vessel for crypto heaven. We leave the boat when we reach the moon and trade into alts if the lighting network still isn't activated yet
@_date: 2017-12-23 12:58:17
Ding ding bitcoin hits $1,000,000. All the fiat millionaires are now poor and the techno utopia begins. Just after this transaction confirms
@_date: 2017-12-31 12:55:45
Were you offered the option to force a charge back? It will destroy your coinbase account I guess but if you need the money I'm going to have to do it
@_date: 2017-12-29 13:47:21
It would have mostly been online banner ads and memes then 
@_date: 2017-12-25 12:59:54
2009-2011 is a super early adopter. I've never met one all my buddies and I, like most people here, bought in around 400$ in 2014
@_date: 2017-12-19 02:33:56
The inverse of this hurt my head
@_date: 2017-12-24 13:16:42
What's the problem? Core is clearly the problem. It doesn't make economical or business sense to spend 25$ per transaction. Just feel the hate is misdirected at bitpay here
@_date: 2017-12-09 12:03:04
Yeah they suck but you will get your money, it may be a long months wait tho
@_date: 2017-12-09 12:01:49
How long is it going to take 3, 4 or 5 years more?! The core dev team aren't trying scale at all
@_date: 2017-12-31 13:13:30
Yeah it's annoying we have to shame them on social media/reddit for them to fix up our issues. Like that's not a sustainable business practice!!
@_date: 2017-12-23 13:02:20
More than 1 less than 10 is my answer
@_date: 2017-12-29 13:35:39
Not if people try to use it as a currency and not solely a store of value 
@_date: 2017-12-31 01:03:03
My deposit has been stuck in limbo for the past week :/
@_date: 2017-12-09 12:04:49
There is less real life adoption in commerce now than in 2014. Bitcoin will never be used as a currency with 10-20$ fees, it's a store value into other alts
@_date: 2017-12-09 14:37:21
I agree, it is flimsy. I can't really justify the current price given how the tech has gone backwards
@_date: 2017-12-17 14:06:04
Has anyone cashed in though? As my naive Grandad says "they're just magic beans, until the cash is in your account, sonny boy jim"
@_date: 2014-03-13 18:51:40
But conversely, with Bitcoin there is little to no protection unless you buy from a larger retailer such as overstock. It's a difficult thing to balance, do you favor buyers or sellers? Is it possible to have a completely flawless system?
@_date: 2014-11-17 00:38:28
Just don't report it? Ooo
@_date: 2014-11-13 17:23:11
Nevertheless it is still making the process for the end consumer a burden and increases the barriers to entry into the world of cryptocurrencies. Ultimately slowing down adoption :(
@_date: 2014-10-01 07:42:51
Couldn't the thief, if technologically apt, just blackmail the victim? Giving an ultimatum of "send me your bitcoins or prepare to get shanked". Course you could call there bluff or have a smaller separate wallet. 
@_date: 2015-01-04 04:15:48
localbitcoins - cash in hand ;)

I think a virtual pc within a virtual pc is far safer, other redditors may go more levels deeper

Don't talk about things you don't have an understanding about then
@_date: 2017-08-04 04:10:52
A house of cards. Basing your entire country's economy on finance is dangerous. You can only trade with illusions with a healthy and varied economy full of different industries. Finance operations are based on the success of other industries in the economy. I'm really worried about the direction my country is going...
@_date: 2017-08-02 00:49:30
But our biggest strength too
@_date: 2017-08-01 02:12:14
Haha as you can tell I'm not a hacker.. I guessed that based on your use of the word "ace"
But what if a large supermarket + astroturfing + big data of food purchasing habits = your identity /s
@_date: 2017-08-04 03:55:25
If you know your site 'shut down' how will you ever retrieve your coins? They are long gone man..
@_date: 2017-08-04 04:04:22
I brought up this point in about significant block size increases means only the most advanced miners can work on the blocks, thereby centralising power to the one or two groups that support BCH. Making an attack on the network possible with 51%+ of the hash power. Yeah, seemed valid to me, but I got downvoted harshly lol
@_date: 2017-08-02 23:58:47
Didn't mean to offend you by saying 'technologically incompetent', I more meant that we are ahead of the masses and even we get hacked! It doesn't give a good impression for the future adoption as these are scary stories and rightly so, nobody can afford to lose their life savings.
In cypocurrency followings, like this subreddit, there is this deep rooted libertarian/cypherpunk ideology behind the technology that loses are your own fault because you are your own agent ergo accountable. Reality isn't like this, there must be some way to retrieve funds that have been stolen, some recourse, but it will never be possible without centralization.
@_date: 2017-08-01 00:21:51
Any idea on the probability of you scrolling down this list and randomly stopping at an actual private key? That'd be a job for @_date: 2017-08-09 09:57:46
You can setup a script to scan the web for your obituary etc.
It's all kinda theoretical atm tho
@_date: 2017-08-04 03:54:08
No. Be your own bank there is no recourse or centralized service to help you
@_date: 2017-08-04 04:05:24
Why don't you ask what online services opened then and are still around now, that seems much more likely to be successful in your end!!
@_date: 2017-08-01 01:55:04
Hope you've got some more you didn't gamble!!
@_date: 2017-08-12 18:49:47
1 Bitcoin? 'All or nothing' Haha
@_date: 2017-08-04 03:58:40
So they will add it to the exchange? Still very unclear
@_date: 2017-08-02 12:14:38
LOUD NOISES
@_date: 2017-08-09 12:29:15
What scripts have you setup?
@_date: 2017-08-09 09:56:07
Yeah I reported my mum when she changed my pounds to euros when I went on me holidays
@_date: 2017-08-01 02:19:06
Be your own bank, kill your own family. It's all the same
@_date: 2017-08-03 09:05:56
Go check out for more balanced views on BCH
@_date: 2017-08-09 09:51:02
No it will crash now, surely? Buy the dip to $2900/3000
@_date: 2017-08-02 14:01:08
It is not analogous to central banks printing money because your Bitcoin Cash, or any other altcoin for that matter, cannot be used or transferred in the Bitcoin Core blockchain - it is rejected because it is running different software and doesn't align with Bitcoin core's blockchain
@_date: 2017-08-01 00:01:17
Learn from the past don't have regrets dude. Be happy you found out about Bitcoin this early in the game because it's still early days
@_date: 2017-08-09 09:47:58
Lets smelt my bitcoins and wear them in sacrifice to satosi 
@_date: 2017-08-02 12:06:21
Nothing is clear. Segwit may fail and a bigger block size may be a better solution to scale. The value of BCH is now at $600 already
@_date: 2017-08-09 09:40:54
@_date: 2017-08-01 02:00:21
Any hacker would have your post history.
Looks like you are from the north of england? One step closer to you... Be careful
@_date: 2017-08-01 03:55:36
To me it just shows the progress Bitcoin has made in the last few years. To see an article not about the price is great, as that's usually all the mainstream media write up
@_date: 2017-08-02 14:06:36
Bitcoin core did also change hence the fork. You know all that about the NYA and segwit those are changes to the software
@_date: 2017-08-02 21:29:15
Be your own bank, it's an experiment and doesn't work for everyone
@_date: 2017-08-12 18:40:57
The golden question - when to sell
@_date: 2017-08-12 18:32:52
Good luck with that. The defining feature of Bitcoin is decentralization, you can't control what everyone does and that's a strength
@_date: 2017-08-03 09:07:46
I think it's more likely a group of people than an individual 
@_date: 2017-08-02 23:07:17
Yes I'd agree however the entire premise of Bitcoin is to construct a payment system that has no risk of so called "chargebacks" whereby a user has the ability to retrieve their payment usually for illegitimate reasons but of course this is haven for hackers too.
There are large problems to face regarding this and it will hinder bitcoins ability to scale because the majority of people are technologically incompetent in securing their wallets and usually due to no fault of their own
@_date: 2017-08-04 04:15:08
Start here dude, it's mixed with other services but won't take long if you have a good memory?
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:20:53
it's best when you finally find that 3rd coinbase account you setup and nearly bought with but you didn't and then you lost the account. But you did get that $10 bonus for signing up... or 0.0166 worth of bitcoin circa 2014. Ah the bitter sweet mostly sweet bitcoin does giveth
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:42:31
Silly to ask but do you recognise the address it was sent to? Or have you looked at any activity from that address? Because if there hasn't been any activity then I'd guess that it's likely your wallet somewhere 
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:40:45
ITS A GOOD NUMBER BECAUSE IT'LL MAKE ME RICH SO IT'S ACCURATE /s
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:38:50
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:10:22
You forgot about your bcash and BTG
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:49:17
Sound like you sent it out of the exchange to a wallet on your pc. Do you have backups of your pc?
@_date: 2017-11-21 18:37:07
So use a coin mixer like the good olde days?
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:40:49
10,400 dude..
@_date: 2017-11-29 12:10:15
Jesus don't try that on kraken ��
@_date: 2017-11-30 00:27:35
search for the wallet.dat file on your pc
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:37:51
the email would have rebounded if it didn't exist like you say and then coinbase would have cancelled the transaction
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:28:00
Look up Iota. Really a look into the future. Far more advanced and efficient than bitcoin. It doesn't even have a blockchain or miners
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:14:33
Bitcoin might get banned in America but there will always be ways to bypass that - cat and mouse
@_date: 2017-10-18 15:14:40
Bitcoin is unlikely to ever see western government support. We have a system based on debt in order to see Bitcoin accepted by gov we'd have to see total system change. Who knows though ��
@_date: 2017-10-11 00:18:02
We've come far in terms of bitcoins value and investment adoption but I don't think we've come much further in regards to utilising it as a currency which is somewhat depressing.. But the gains well who can complain!
@_date: 2017-10-11 00:35:51
I guess I'm somewhat impatient? Like how can we predict when we've reached a correct valuation of btc inorder to live in a society where using digital currencies is commonplace.. 10 years 20 years?  
To me the experiment has failed if it's only used exclusively as a store of value.. which the majority do do now I believe 
@_date: 2017-05-26 17:30:36
Totally appreciate your views on Bitcoin as an investment.
I'm in it for the heart not the head
@_date: 2017-05-30 00:04:17
Yes, if there is widespread adoption of Bitcoin. A very big if. Glad to be in it with you though, whatever happens
@_date: 2017-05-24 18:34:25
Yeah, were you using Bitcoin gambling sites to make that much?
@_date: 2017-05-27 20:22:37
@_date: 2017-05-26 10:05:04
Bitcoin would lose value if it became only an investment. It must be used as a currency.
Sure hodl some btc and replace what you do spend, but this greedy attitude is frustrating
@_date: 2017-05-24 17:56:02
In addition you can meet up with someone from localbitcoins in your area and they can pay you cash
@_date: 2017-05-25 23:38:46
Yeah looking back at my silkroad purchases... I've spent a cool $1,000,000 on weed
It's how we build a currency though right? Right.
@_date: 2017-05-26 17:04:05
You most definitely cannot compare company's stock as akin to Bitcoin.
A company derives its stock value from its operations and financial success in its marketplace.
The value of Bitcoin lies in its use as a currency, as a technology and its perceived value in the future. As a hypothetical, if EVERYONE only held Bitcoin as is proposed all the time here, and didn't trade with it then the cumulative effect would make it become valueless to the world as a technology. What would it do? Nothing. The market price would crash to zero.
But of course, a portion of people thankfully do continue to use it for its purpose as a currency. How many as a p.c of owners remains somewhat ambiguous. Reports from e-retailers is positive and usage has been growing. My point is, using Bitcoin to buy things shouldn't be a regretful experience. Use the technology, enjoy it please!
@_date: 2017-05-24 18:24:26
It is one of the functions of a bank account hehe.
I mean all you can do is check the buyer has solid feedback and on that basis work out they won't rob you?
@_date: 2017-07-31 00:13:06
Yeah it is pathetic, same here bud
@_date: 2017-07-31 20:26:40
Can you export the private keys?
@_date: 2017-05-24 16:44:20
1. Get a bank account
2. Sell on localbitcoins, that's your easiest way
@_date: 2015-10-14 23:04:53
It's all about processing information securely, bitcoins or whatever
@_date: 2017-07-31 23:55:39
Is this every possible arrangement of characters that go into a private key? Cool stuff
@_date: 2017-07-02 11:10:35
Yeah and I'm well placed with the regulations in the Isle of Man ��
@_date: 2017-07-16 23:50:24
You'd have to sign a code from Coinbase proving you own the address the coins came from... It's not much admin work at all
@_date: 2017-05-28 11:52:22
More than safe considering the virtual pc will be encrypted too 
@_date: 2017-07-29 01:31:31
You did, just not in this reality 
@_date: 2017-05-24 17:54:28
I'm just very suspicious of Bitcoin 'debit cards' because you risk losing your coins given you don't get to keep a private wallet. I'm quite risk averse after being involved with Gox back in the day.
Do any of your family or friends have a bank account? Or is that not an option for you?
@_date: 2017-06-12 01:56:38
I'd store it on an online wallet yeah.
If you are serious contact a proper service, you're rich do it properly not asking on a forum
@_date: 2017-06-15 02:42:44
They have access to the bank transactions you sent to exchanges
@_date: 2017-06-20 18:28:49
You can use an online wallet and import it! You can do all this on chrome on android
@_date: 2017-06-07 00:51:32
Yeah, this is interesting
@_date: 2017-06-04 00:53:07
Yes you can pool your resources. I'd see this as an educational project rather than for profit. Just to understand your expectations
@_date: 2017-06-12 19:54:35
I'm selling before and buying back, I'm more willing to lose a little on a buy back than lose a lot in a crash and much lower price recovery 
@_date: 2017-06-02 10:19:59
So true, dude ever heard of print screen 
@_date: 2017-06-15 21:01:00
Sell sell sell. Your persuasion to hold Bitcoin as a hive mind inflates the price. Which I guess is the whole point
@_date: 2017-06-06 16:19:49
Sell before the crash and buy back ��
@_date: 2017-06-10 20:09:01
Wouldn't trust kraken, but Coinbase is better. It's best to get your coins and get out
@_date: 2017-06-11 13:17:02
I'd have to agree, the technology has gone backwards since I joined in 2013...
I want to empty my current clients wallet (MultiBit HD) and move to a better client but it's going to cost me ~$50 to move $3000 worth of btc. A user shouldn't be this conflicted about using the technology for the very purpose it was built..
@_date: 2017-06-08 11:51:09
Taxes are required to build and maintain society and civil life. Sorry. But by the way, I'm from the Isle of Man where there is 0% capital gains tax ��
@_date: 2017-06-21 00:32:05
Brute forcing a 4 digit code wouldn't take long but if it's multiple letters and numbers it can take literally years on your pc, so it becomes not worth it as the cost of electricity exceeds your btc password you'll trying to crack
@_date: 2017-06-12 01:48:02
My glass ball predicts by 2027 there will be national crypto currencies but Bitcoin will always be the first and a novelty to own
@_date: 2017-06-16 20:12:06
Export your private keys and import them into a cloud client like MultiBit.
Don't reveal how much you have and make yourself a target 
@_date: 2017-07-15 11:35:21
Private key is as strong as a gun to your head

@_date: 2017-06-15 22:20:14
Comes with a complete box set of friends
@_date: 2017-06-21 00:03:31
Can you be a little clearer. Have you forgotten the password for the wallet.dat file i.e is it encrypted?
@_date: 2017-06-20 18:25:57
They would have to pick one chain and act as an exchange for it. Coins purchased on that chain will only be registered on the chain they originated from
@_date: 2017-06-10 20:08:09
Didn't Uber recently sell their Chinese operations to another Chinese based business?
@_date: 2017-06-11 21:16:39
Rent a Lamborghini and say you own it. I'm not saying she's a gold digger..
@_date: 2017-06-21 00:45:40
If it's a 6 digit numerical encryption and you don't know it than it's worth holding onto the wallet imo; by the time you can crack it due to technological advancements the btc could be worth thousands
@_date: 2017-06-08 01:37:59
I opt for using a virtual pc inside a virtual pc. Much safer
@_date: 2017-06-06 16:18:06
What was the date?!
@_date: 2017-06-12 19:46:31
It's the money people have invested in it I believe
@_date: 2017-06-06 19:24:05
But still, I only heard of Bitcoin in 2013. Seems such a nice item to own while pondering the power of the blockchain. Maybe a stroke of the chin too
@_date: 2017-06-08 01:40:37
Haha you have to be a troll
@_date: 2017-06-04 00:42:33
You are only 4+ years late to the mining party with "ordinary" computer hardware.
The difficulty level is now so high you require specialist equipment to mine. Mining with a raspberry pi will not have any chance of breaking the solution on the block, you'll simply never recoup the cost of electricity. Sorry man!
@_date: 2017-06-15 20:59:05
It wouldn't. There would be several blockchains in such a scenario.
Plus we would use any electricity for much more important things you know like heating and ventilation systems in nuclear proof bunkers 
@_date: 2017-06-02 10:16:18

@_date: 2017-06-27 19:48:46
Doritos are so dry without dip dude true
@_date: 2017-06-11 13:19:15
Make sure you have the seed words too if you're using MultiBit HD
@_date: 2017-06-12 02:07:07

You see, an excellent plan
@_date: 2017-06-15 20:55:42

That's how we roll ��
@_date: 2017-06-12 02:23:19
Oh but a very expensive novelty, don't get me wrong.
I think we will see strong government and corporate forces utilize the blockchain technology but at the same time centralize it.
Don't worry nobody knows this is just my glass ball ��
@_date: 2017-06-20 23:56:02
Unfortunately I don't think there is any service that has a menomic or pass as an option, you have to have the "raw" private keys ready to import.
Don't worry once you have a PC up and running, regardless of its performance, you're bitcoins will be safe. Sorry can't be of any more help dude 
@_date: 2013-12-16 21:29:00
What would be the implications if the US decided to ban the use of bitcoin in the future as a currency? Would that effectively be the end of bitcoin or not?
