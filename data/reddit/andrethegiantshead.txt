Where are you going to plug all those in?  What about the heat?  
You are going to need around 16KW of power and you will generate substantial heat.  If you sell them on eBay you will get a chargeback and lose your miners.
How are you going to get the 600 on Saturday?  They aren't shipping for a month at least.  Also that seems really cheap for the 500GH units.  Are you sure about the seller?  You are using escrow right?

When Bitcoin's ready, you won't have to sell them.
@_date: 2014-01-25 16:17:25
Chargebacks can happen 6 months or more after the initial charges.   This will be a disaster.  You cannot trade a reversible currency for a irreversible currency.
Here is the only way this could work.
1)  Make the buyer purchase US coins from the US mint and ship them to Coindrip.
2) Coindrip then sells you Bitcoins for the US coins.
3) Coindrip deposits US coins in their bank account.
4) Coindrip is protected from chargebacks and if the buyer wants to try to chargeback the US Mint they will have a bad time.
EDIT:  After visiting USMINT.gov the government now charges a 10% surcharge for coins.  That kind of sucks but it still could work.

With 75K you could buy around 100 Antminers at 180GH each.  That will net you 18TH which will make around 2.5 BTC a day at todays difficulty.
You will need power supplies for all of them.  I recommend buying old IBM 2000W blade center PSU's and making the PCIE connections yourself.
You will need some cheap shelving, I recommend rolling racks.
You will need 400W for each Antminer.  I recommend connecting 4 Antminers per each 2000W PSU.
25 PSU's each need 2000W.  So 25 X 30amp breakers.
You can put 8 X 30amp breakers in each 200amp main breaker boxes.
You will need 3 X 200amp breaker boxes for the Antminers.
I would get another 200amp box for cooling and anything else you need to power.  
Here are 2 of my 200amp breakers  - [imgur](

Mine scrypt coins with video cards and trade them for BTC.    Build a GPU machine with 5 X R9 280X's and a 1500W PSU and you can make close to a BTC a month.  Good luck finding video cards in stock though. 
 
5 X R9 280X - $2000
1 MSI Motherboard - $200
1 1500W PSU - $350
4GB RAM - $30
AMD Sempron 45 - $40
Powered extender cables - $100
I hope you like noise and heat because this baby will put out a lot of it.  Also your electric bill will be around $80-$120/mo for this machine to run.  If you turn everything else off in your apartment and unplug the fridge and get a small fridge that uses less power your landlord might not notice.  If you have a girlfriend she is going to hate the noise.
Also backup batteries will do nothing for you.  I ran 80 video cards for 2 years and I killed 2 X 3000W Battery backup's and 5 1500W battery backups.

How much "free" electricity do you think you have?  If you used $1000 a month do you think your landlord would just say, "Well, we said free electricity, I guess we have to give it to him."  No, you would be evicted if you could even figure out a way to use that much electricity.  You probably have a very small amp panel in your apartment.  I would be surprised if you had more than 60 amps available.  
60 amps constant use at .10/KWH = 60X110 = 158.4KWH/Day =  4752KWH/Month = $475.20 a month if you could even pull 60 amps constantly without starting a fire in your electrical lines.
And then there is the heat...

How is it a waste?  Bacteria love rotting fruit.  If we used 100% of the fruit and never threw any away what would the poor bacteria do?  They would starve to death.  Think of the little creatures that are just trying to feed their baby amoebas.

How much of the $750K have you blown through in the last 7 months just living? I have a very similar story in which my mother in law was placed in charge of a young  girl with a 1.5M inheritance. My MIL planned it so her education was paid for and planned so the principal would not be touched and the interest would grow the principal over time as she got older. The problem was the girl had too much control. She blew the money on parties, drugs, cars that she wrecked, condos that she trashed, etc and stopped going to school. The money was gone in a few short years and one day she called for more money and my MIL told her it was all gone. A very sad story. She finally got a job and is stable now. You will run out of money soon enough and you will discover humility soon. You need to stop living off the principal and get a job.

I can write you an perl script that can break that password pretty quickly if it is a dictionary word.  Otherwise it could take a few months to brute force it.  It depends on how much BTC we are talking about to see if it is worth it.

So it's like two guys sitting at a table and adding money to a pile and if someone forgets to add money to the pile in the middle of the night they lose the pot?  I could write a perl script that would never lose.  It would wait 59 min after last bet then place minimum higher bet.  If the other players responds the script waits another 59 min. and sends another bet.  I always win.

No.  They do all of their calculations based on that seasoned money.  It has to be seasoned.  I got in a fight with my mortgage company when I was buying my house about the same thing.  I finally told my realtor that if we didn't close in 1 week I was walking away.  She made it happen.
@_date: 2013-11-12 02:50:30
Buying a Billion dollars all at once at this time would be stupid.  If you invested 1/3 of the market cap of bitcoin would you roughly double the price?  You would have to do it slowly and strategically.  Wait for people to put up a large asks wall and then eat them.  You will minimally affect the price of Bitcoin and you will buy a large amount.
@_date: 2013-08-29 21:50:11

I think it's en masse, but I still understood.  Those poor bacteria. The bacteria farts make all the methane that's why they have those tubes running from the ground to the big bunsen burner.  So the strongest bacteria are thriving all compacted and oxygen starved.  It's like evolution in turbo mode.  I still feel bad for the weak bacterias that died out.  Maybe if they just had a few hundred more mitochondria they would have made it.

@_date: 2013-08-01 13:47:47
This will not work.  I speak from experience.  Digital signature's mean nothing.  The credit card companies will side with the buyers every time and you will get hit with the chargeback plus a fee (usually around $30) for each chargeback.   
Do you know how much paperwork you have to fill out for 1 chargeback?  It is crazy.  Now times that by 100.  
The only way to be 100% sure with a credit card purchase is to wait 6 months before you deliver the Bitcoins.  I have gotten chargebacks up to 6 months after a purchase.  The chargebacks ususally happen around 4-6 weeks after the initial purchase.

Exactly.  You guys are going to do 200K in business in a month and then 6 weeks later your mailbox will be filled with blue envelopes.  50% of your orders will charge the Bitcoins back and they will all be for around $100-$200 each charge so there is no way you will be able to fight them all.

I wonder if you physically mailed the bitcoins on a paper wallet you would be covered under the Paypal Seller Protection program since you would have a tracking number and a signature.  I bet you would but after you kept getting chargeback after chargeback you would eventually be cut off.

Why would you buy coins at higher prices to sell them at lower prices?  I think you meant the opposite. Now you know why everyone doesn't sell on Mt Gox and think their money will instantly arrive in their bank account so they can send it to Bitstamp and buy the coins back cheaper.  You forgot to include the time delta in your master plan.
when someone starts another thread tomorrow about this you can tell them why it doesn't work.
