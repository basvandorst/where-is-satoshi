You vastly overestimate the impact this would have. Most people in most countries do not own any crypto, or have a small lottery ticket like amount. I work in finance, where guys are making 6 and 7 figures, and only a couple have anything more than $1k. Most have nothing, and a few have ~$500 of beer money.

Very unlikely that this was a whale selling covered calls. A friend of mine runs a desk at a prop shop that is selling crypto vol to institutionals. They are delta neutral.
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:37:13
Scrolled down to read your comment: unlikely to be a vega play from the long side as the mkt isn't really liquid enough to support that type of book. Given the realized vol, this was actually a pretty decent buy (not sure what the vol or skew was, but looking at Deribit gives an idea). The amount you'd have made trading your gamma in the last 24 hours is nuts.
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:35:44
No, I’m not trading cryptos at all. And all the proper OTC stuff is LedgerX. I don’t know anything about Deribit, aside from the fact that they have a public vol curve. Out of curiosity, is Deribit sketchy?
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:09:52
It's true that the options expire worthless if BTC settles at the $50k strike. But, that's not really why institutionals trade options...they do it to be long volatility. In the mean time, the option has convexity to trade around. Most likely the option long is laid up (delta neutral) and the market maker certainly is. So what you're really buying is gamma (google options greeks) more than defined downside.

No, you're getting the cause and effect reversed for *bitcoin*.
Under normal circumstances, yes, that is the cause and effect. But with bitcoin, *it is engineered to be deflationary*. So deflation is a given constant and thus lower velocity is the effect.
And no, your argument *is* bogus. This is why we have nominal vs real interest rates. We expect the money to be less valuable, but that doesn't mean I won't forgo it. A merchant transacts with fiat, because he is still better off tomorrow after transacting. He can either then earn interest or be forced to spend it (thereby furthering MV).

Sure, you could do that. But inflation tends to be a price paid for stability whereas finite goods tend to be much more volatile. So you may forgo a loss of purchasing power but just substitute for a loss (or gain) of principal.

Ok, but an exchange by definition is centralized. Otherwise it's just a broker-dealer OTC system. An exchange's goal is to centralize supply and demand so as to present the best bid/offer to the market.

You're forgetting the reason commodity markets work is because of delivery and settlement mechanisms. You can call me deluded, but just because you've read a fucking Michael Lewis book doesn't make you an expert. You can think it's irresponsible, or evil, but the things I do on a daily basis would make your tiny little head explode. You just have no fucking clue what you're talking about outside of these simplistic analogies that are in no way remotely factual.
So time to fuck you up with some truth: if there were only one barrel of oil, but a thousand oil futures trading, the market would work fine. In fact, it's more efficient since more participants insure that all available information is reflected in the price. So guess what, if the price is too cheap, the Evil Speculators™ will demand delivery against their contract. The first guy gets his one barrel. Well now there's no more. So the second guy demands his from the guy who is short. But that guy has no oil, so he has to cover his short (buy his future back, i.e. de facto cash settlement). This drives price up (reflecting the limited supply...hurr durr still with me?). The same happens with the next guy, and the next, and so on. Until finally the price gets high enough, that either the longs sell their futures back to the shorts, or the original guy now holding the barrel redelivers his oil to the futures market since the price is now so attractive. **Either way, the delivery/settlement mechanism forces convergence between the physical and derivative markets otherwise arbitrages could be made.** But reality like that doesn't fit in with your daily exercise in "Why does my life suck? WALL STREET FUUUUUU"
You could make the same analogy with Average Joe 99%er, the local neighborhood baker since I'm sure that anything involving intelligent people making money pushes you into a fit of rage. He buys wheat futures to hedge himself. He never plans on taking delivery, just to lock in his price. And this allows him to run his business without worry about price fluctuations.

Ah you're one of these. Reminds me of the guys who created a Twitter algo to quantify sentiment which ended up being a leading indicator of US equities (among others).

Trade sentiment just means I am trading market sentiment. I usually couple it with some technical analysis, but the market is so think that someone with a bit of capital can break technical trends easily. And fundamentals right now account for less than 1% of the market sooo that's pointless.
Levered scalps - A scalp means a quick trade for relatively small amounts. Levered means using leverage (borrowing money). So I may buy X BTC with borrowed money, only looking to profit $10-15 and then close the trade.
My general bitcoin strategy is to trade around a core holding. So I leg into a bigger position, and then trade smaller positions around it.
@_date: 2014-03-10 06:48:56


Finance type here. This is the typical simplistic (and emotional) counter that I've seen here towards opposition. And frankly it's so hypocritical since it's exactly what you're accusing "finance types" of doing (ETF? Maybe a couple of the big ETF sponsors, but for most people, lol no.)
I have a genuine question. I fall somewhere in the middle. I don't work for a bank. My job is just to make money for investors be it with bitcoin, commodities, equities, etc. I don't care. As a huge tech nerd, bitcoin has captured my attention as I find it incredibly fascinating. The economist in me however also see faults.
I don't ultimately know the success or failure of bitcoin. I don't think it will die. But I also don't fall into the 1,000x rally either. With that being said, I have a genuine question: if bitcoin does not succeed, will any of the hardcore proponents be able to see the actual cause of failure? Or will it be written off as an NSA/GCHQ/Too-big-to-fail/Koch brother conspiracy? The risk here is that people become blind.
**TL;DR Perceived infallibility is *exactly* what caused the financial crisis in 2008 and the belief that if bitcoin fails, it could not possibly due to a fault with bitcoin risks leading this community and entire ecosystem down the exact same path (and likely to similar fate).**

It's because your comment, much like this post, makes no sense. Any time you "use" bitcoin you are selling. Maybe you aren't selling for fiat, but you are selling for something else.
And this is the reason why deflation is bad because it limits money velocity. If bitcoin keeps going up, why would anyone spend?
@_date: 2014-02-16 16:49:16
Re-read what I said. I said only the perpetrator knows if the original pump was profitable (it very well may have been...he wasn't buying $200 above market, it was the initial order that prompted others to). But the obvious purpose was to break MtGox below $300 (as I said) which is why I don't believe it to be a fat finger.
*EDIT* Think of it this way. I buy all BTC up to $50 over market price. This massive order prompts tons of others to panic buy, they then buy from $50 over to $200 over while I'm selling to them. But I don't think that's what happened. I think someone bought much more than that, for the sole purpose of selling them all at once.
@_date: 2014-03-29 06:25:52
Huge vol is not good for adoption. While it may let you buy dips and grab short term gains, it reduces bitcoin to nothing more than a decentralized penny stock. In currencies, a 10% price move is HUGE and often takes place over a long period (EMs tend to be the exception). For anyone curious, a couple percent pullback in the CNY (and CNH cousin) is causing huge issues and billions in losses for Chinese companies.
So while panic may be great short term (I love it, being short 90% of the time) **but if you are bullish about adoption, stop wishing for these kinds of things.**

Sure you do. You have every right to sell whatever you want. But if you sell the house, and can't purchase it from its current owner before you've promised it to the new buyer, you're in a world of hurt.
However, a house is not a commodity. Bitcoins are perfectly substitutable whereas a house is not. So the risk that you cannot obtain a bitcoin on the open market is very low, as opposed to the house which has a vastly greater risk due to lack of substitutability.
EDIT: These kinds of comparisons are poor at best. I could use the house example to say that a virtual house does not have nearly the value nor utility of a real house...and therefore bitcoin could never achieve the value nor utility of a "real" currency.

Well first of all, we don't manipulate markets, despite what the main stream media would have you believe. Not saying it doesn't happen (Libor fixing, FX fixing, etc) but even those were relatively "small" manipulations.
With a few billion in assets under management, our allocations have to be of decent size. So when we deploy capital, we need fairly liquid markets. Bitcoin is not liquid at all. Plus, if we wanted to go put on a "small" $100mm position, we'd own a significant size of the market.
Then you add on the fact that it doesn't have any real fundamental supply/demand forces that we can analyze.

No. If the exchange is insolvent, it doesn't matter whether you own fiat or bitcoin. You get nothing either way. But it's probabilistic.
Let's do the math. You have $70 (for easy maths) in fiat. 80% chance they are bankrupt. Your expected return here is $14 ($0 * 80% + $70 * 20%). Or you hold 0.2 BTC ($70 equivalent @ ~$350). Now we have to make an assumption about spreads but let's say that if they are solvent, MtGox prices rally to $500. Your expected return then is then $20 ($0 * 80% + 0.2 * $500 * 20%).

No. The number of companies is not artificially limited by ICANN (closest analogy I can think of) but they are not virtually infinite. At the very least, they are limited by the sheer resources of society.
In practicality, they are far from abundant, which is why you saw many companies with ludicrous valuations (and current ratios are creeping back up or are already there). This is also why VCs today are fed up with current deals and looking elsewhere. The competition is fierce.
And also no, additional capital does not necessitate higher prices. At the very least, you're glossing over money velocity. At worst, you're glossing over the entire dynamics of the supply curve.

There is quite a bit of misinformation re: naked short selling here. Naked short selling does not mean that you just get to make up asset X. It means that you short it without having secured a borrow beforehand. This has worked historically since i.e. stocks settled T+3 so you could short first, and arrange a borrow any time between then and settlement.
The risk of naked shorts becomes counter party risk between time of trade and settlement. It's not that it makes everything a "betting site" (shorts actually *improve* price discovery). More importantly, let's say the market decoupled due to some naked short anomaly, arbs would step in and force convergence. This is the entire reason CFDs and derivatives work (law of one price).

For most people, especially in developed nations, bitcoin brings little to the table at the moment. Then add in the complexity, and recent perceived risks, I'm not sure what you expected.

I'm still pretty young (24) so I don't want to come off as a seasoned pro who has seen everything. I'd like to think I'm knowledgeable but I definitely try to understand my limits.
With that being said, long term is really, really tough and pretty much has nothing to do with trading. So your guess is as good as mine. Right now, I just trade bitcoin. When (if?) the volatility cools off, I'll probably stick whatever profits I have back in as a long shot investment in BTC.
From a tech perspective, the long confirmation times with BTC seem problematic. From an economics stand point, the inherent deflation is problematic (I know many people view this as a feature and not a bug). I do not agree that all inflation is evil (it's necessary). You can be against central bank interventions, but still appreciate the importance of inflation.

This guy (day trader as you put it) is not a "finance guy" and almost certainly doesn't using models or economics or much else that has been suggested. Best case, he uses Black-Scholes if he does trade options, but most individual day traders just use options for leverage or to collect premia, and rarely actually trade vol. So I just want that to be clear. Day traders are momentum traders. That's it.
I am a finance guy, and I fall somewhere in the middle. I recognize bitcoin's strength as well is its weakness.

You're missing the point. The software doesn't matter. You would absolutely *not* need an "insurmountable" number of people. You would actually need a rather small group, especially given bitcoin's liquidity (or lack there of).

Yes, it slowly decreases value over time. Actually, the stability incentivizes one to spend it *more* than if it were unstable. If it were to fluctuate wildly, who knows maybe tomorrow it's worth more (or maybe it's worth less). But uncertainty *always* creates inefficiency.


Reliable? You have to explain. Currency reliability is really the most important quality in that you can reliably exchange for disparate goods and services. I think you mean something else here, and I am curious since you seem to have a more calm, logical approach than most around here. So please respond. :)
But I will attempt an answer anyway: yes, rampant inflation is more destabilizing than moderate deflation (think Zimbabwe). Which is why the sweet spot is in a mildly inflationary zone (which usually indicates expanding economic activity instead of central bank policy). But higher prices (ceteris paribus) tends to bring on more volatility (if only in absolute terms).
@_date: 2014-02-28 14:47:29
Uh sure, but that doesn't change your statement or obvious misunderstanding.
@_date: 2014-03-06 09:38:48
People are merely using it to transact: i.e. I keep 5 coins at all times. I spend 0.5 coins, I immediately go purchase 0.5 coins.
This is what I have heard from most people. It is really just a money transmission system (which I think is actually where bitcoin's future lay). But most people are not actually reducing their bitcoin holdings when they spend (again, based on the very limited sample of bitcoin adopters I've talked to or read about).
@_date: 2014-03-29 16:31:21


Firstly, you are focusing solely on the network propagation. This is the same as transferring money to another account holder at the same bank. This is free. You are ignoring every other part of the process. I am not talking about mining fees. I am talking about Coinbase, BitStamp, etc. Also, while the fee issue is not true for banks, it *is* true for Visa. Visa is a transaction network. So yes, it's all true for Visa.
My back of the envelope calcs of $2T in volume over 50B transactions at 24c avg fee is ~65bps in fees. And that is on the most expensive side of the ecosystem, namely the consumer facing side. The institutional arena has much lower fees.


Barrier to entry is not zero. That is hyperbole and is completely false. The processors are making well above risk adjusted break even, evidenced by the influx of venture capital money. So no...just no.


Except that the largest transaction network is operated and regulated by the Fed, and that is really much more comparable to Bitcoin. The fees there are extremely low. The side where Visa/Mastercard escape said regulation is revolving credit lines (aka credit cards) due to their much more complex nature. So that's really the wrong comparison. Debit card fees are the proper corollary.


The hypothetical is not flawed as your strawman attack is null. The hypothetical was if one scaled up volumes today, the fees would be astronomical. The hypothetical was not if you let the ecosystem progress over a number of years, the fees won't come down.
**The bigger issue is you have a massive contradiction: either barrier to entry is zero and the market should arbitrage excess risk adjusted returns, or the ecosystem needs to grow before processors can achieve economies of scale and reduce their fees. Pick one. You can't have both. Don't just argue for the sake of supporting Bitcoin at all cost.**
If you're running a simple, small business you probably come out about even when all is accounted for. But if you are doing anything more complicated, you get screwed. Minimum 1% fees everywhere. I can go buy $100mm EURUSD for 20bps with super tight spreads. The big boys doing billions, get even lower sub 10bps. This is mainly what I'm talking about. But even the consumer facing transactional elements have significantly higher fees.

@_date: 2014-03-29 06:33:01
The irony is strong with this one. Bitcoiner advocating increased regulation.
The fees in bitcoin are INSANE. Exchanges and processors are rolling in margin. Payment processors fees are comparable to credit cards, yet have FAR lower liabilities (think of all the compliance, disputes, fraud, etc that Visa et al have to price in). If you were to scale up the current bitcoin companies' margins to Visa's size, their net income would DWARF those that you complain are "gouging".
I never understood why people don't complain about the asinine fees charged in bitcoin but will riot if BofAML tries to charge a $5 fee for a checking account.
@_date: 2014-02-16 12:45:10
Well, it depends on the direction of the arb. But in this case, you want to get BTC out of Gox to sell on another exchange. So it's the lack of BTC withdrawals.
However, a few weeks ago, it was the reverse. BTC traded at a premium, since if you sold on Gox, you couldn't get fiat out. So fewer people wanted to sell which drove the price up.
@_date: 2014-02-28 04:18:46
Bitcoin is not anonymous. The entire blockchain is public and under most circumstances, the moment you transact with a counterparty, your identity is revealed. It is possible to stay anonymous, but that's certainly not a requirement.
@_date: 2014-04-04 02:05:19


If you wanted to work the same amount as someone 100 years ago, you could and you would still have vastly superior quality of life. Sure, we are working *longer* today (not harder) but we are also far, far richer than at any other point in human history.
You are completely misunderstanding inflation cause and effect. When an economy grows and consumption increases, inflation is all but guaranteed. When monetary debasing occurs, inflation is the goal, and consumption may or may not increase. Recent QE has shown it does very little, and people are not working more today than 5 years ago.
Also your mechanism assumes that people use fiat as a store of wealth on the time scales under which inflation is measurable...which they don't. In fact, outside of today's wacky ZIRP, savers could actually increase wealth by working today and deferring consumption (as you say "earn pre inflation spend post inflation").
@_date: 2014-02-16 16:33:51
No, basically my experience went like this: deposit some play money on Gox, and put some limit orders in waiting for the next crash. I started seeing Bloomberg headlines (months ago) and checked my account and had a bunch of fills, average around $70ish. So I let it ride. I cashed out in the upper $400s and left a bunch on the table. Since then, I really only play it from the short side, pivoting here recently when there have been these crashes.
So right now, I am short from the high $700s, and trading around that position trying to increase my average entry price.

Venture Capital
@_date: 2014-03-06 02:30:57
Regulations for  yes. But actually for  and  I'd say the opposite.
For  regulations increase costs, which reduces liquidity. Also, HFT is incredibly poorly regulated (see: not regulated at all) and while I support HFT immensely in theory, in its current form it chokes liquidity through highly predatory strategies (which it should be a massive liquidity enabler).
For  I suppose it does help volatility by trying to ensure a safe functioning market. But the biggest tools to manage volatility (or exacerbate it when abused) has been financial engineering and volatility derivatives that followed. Even the plain vanilla options market is a huge advantage that bitcoin desperate needs (many people don't realize that the options market in many cases is really the tail that wags the dog).

Nice to see some actual logic. The reason *most* people, governments and corporations feel comfortable holding, using and accepting US dollars is solely because of trust.
Events like this crush the general public's trust (who don't understand a thing about cryptography) but would ultimately be necessary for mass adoption of the protocol. If bitcoin wants to be taken seriously, it has to treat serious matters with real concern. 750k BTC satisfies that requirement.

Yes, I'm speculating. I also work for a hedge fund and understand how they work, how performance and positions are evaluated.
It is very likely that they deployed a small allocation and tucked it away prepared for wild swings. It does happen for more exotic and illiquid products. Options positions (especially OTC) are frequently subject to this. So they may not have.
I'm just saying that with all of the systemic risk that appeared in recent weeks, the PM may have decided that it didn't fit the thesis anymore.
Also wasn't suggesting they had a hard stop order pending. Just that at some point a position hits its max pain.

But yes, normally I just slowly drop shorts into these bids every few points, but going to wait here for a bit of a medium term blow off top to add 100% size back on. Have been sidelined for a few days now, itchy trigger finger.

Honest question, no need to demolish me with downvotes: does anyone have evidence of impropriety at Gox?
I've heard that for some time now but never really seen anything conclusive. They have had growing pains but as the primary target for a very disruptive technology, it's fairly plausible.
Of course the plausibility would provide fantastic cover for malicious activity. But nonetheless, my question stands. I for one think they are solvent.

It's very unlikely to be a single person. Most likely it's a number of people acting together.
As far as capital requirements, I have no idea. But not nearly as much as you'd think. Bitcoin trades incredibly thinly, and you have lots of unsophisticated players.
@_date: 2014-02-14 15:02:04
The logic there I can at least understand. But it's just as irrational since Gox is unlikely to have any assets if they went into liquidation. You can't retrieve something that's not there. In fact the odds of them being solvent (I fall into this camp) are much higher than the odds of you recovering anything in liquidation.
@_date: 2014-02-16 14:13:37
Here we go! Yes, now you are thinking logically! Get this man some up votes, and learn from him.
This is essentially how options are priced, and having bitcoins at Gox is basically owning call options on their equity.

This is nonsensical. Any time you "use" bitcoin you are selling. Maybe you aren't selling for fiat, but you are selling for something else.
And this is the reason why deflation is bad because it limits money velocity. If bitcoin keeps going up, why would anyone spend?

This is the one puzzle to me. I wrote another self.Bitcoin regarding this. Basically, my argument is that if they are insolvent, it doesn't matter whether you own bitcoin or fiat...you get nothing regardless. So given that scenario, it would make sense to own the undervalued asset in the off chance that they aren't actually insolvent (personally, I don't think they are). There should be a spread likely due to a risk off mentality, but the spread is wayyy too big in my opinion. If I could, I would be buying the shit out the Gox-Bitstamp spread.
But the response that was argued against that was in bankruptcy proceedings it may be easier to get compensation if you owned fiat as opposed to bitcoin. So people are selling in the event of a lawsuit. I don't necessarily think that's smart (if they are insolvent, there's likely nothing to liquidate anyway) but the logic is at least sound.

Once the marketing aspect wears off, they will definitely need volumes to increase. Because I can guarantee that the overhead of adding bitcoin to their value chain is over $100k/year so it's quite likely it has a negative IRR at the moment.

Really trying to be polite here. Let's say I lose $1mm that other people have lent me. I now have a $1mm liability. Let's also say that I earn $1mm in net income from my business (fees). I now have a $1mm asset. Those two offset.

I have been fairly consistently profitable in bitcoin (just my personal account). The trick is not to use stops, and to mostly trade sentiment.

No, bitcoin price will likely increase as adoption does, but that doesn't necessarily mean the purchasing power will be more stable (which is really what's required for bitcoin to achieve mainstream currency status). But they are not necessary.
So the way that many people use bitcoin today is merely a fiat transmission system similar to Paypal because most are super bullish about bitcoin price. So instead of actually spending bitcoin (decreasing their holdings), they spend and then immediately replenish by purchasing more bitcoin. Thet net effect of this on bitcoin demand is zero since it's common for the merchant (receiver of bitcoin) to immediately convert to fiat.

But they are only "making money" in terms of other currency. So you have just completely dissolved the BTC is a currency argument. If you mean that people are holding it because they believe the purchasing power will go up, then yes that is true.
It still doesn't solve the problem. People are far less likely to consume if purchasing power is expected to increase.

Most sensible statement here. Naked short selling in itself is not a problem (it can enhance liquidity) but the problem is that when it's done in relatively obscure securities *AND* there is some shock to the market which prevents proper settlement. Counter parties don't know if they are buying from a naked short or not, so proper clearing is essential. But the knock on effects of the collateral chain can lead to systemic events. This is the biggest risk of naked shorting.
@_date: 2014-03-03 03:53:17

Financial futures are often cash settled. But the word future comes from "future delivery" and most commodities have a physical delivery mechanism which is vital to forcing price convergence.

Best analogy I can think of is if Germany defaulted on sovereign debt. The ECB (and thus the Euro) is independent of Germany, just like bitcoin is independent of Gox. But there would be a massive crisis of confidence and flight to safety, similar to what is taking place in bitcoin.

What the fuck does any of that have to do with anything?
You know how many assets have controversy and high expectations attached to them? You live in this bitcoin bubble but forget that most of the world believes Facebook will be more disruptive than bitcoin.
Or take a look at biotechs which have massive disruptive expectations and are often mired in controversy.
Or take the dollar which funds far more drug cartels and terrorist groups than bitcoin.
How about Apple stock, which is dependent on cheap, youth labor in China.
Or banks which are regularly accused of laundering far more "drug currency" than bitcoin could ever dream of.
Lest we even touch on oil, which is responsible for permitting Iran to fund a nuclear weapons program, or giving the Saudis power to oppress their people and fund terrorists worldwide.

What the fuck? CADUSD has not dropped 12%. The last time it traded at parity was over a year ago.
Let's take the last few months, which have been very volatile due to Fed tapering (the beginning of the end to a historically massive monetary debasement). At the start of 2014 CADUSD was .94 and is trading around .9050 today. So over the last 3 months it has fallen 3.7% during a market paradigm shift.

It's no different than accepting pre-sales for some physical good. You order a widget from me today for delivery next week. I haven't produced said widget yet, but I still make the sale. Then between now and then, I procure a widget.
And don't try to patronize me about order books. The mere fact that you put penny stocks and PM futures in the same sentence demonstrates your topical limits. Futures by definition are not a "hard asset" they are contracts for future delivery of some good. So supply and demand are not constrained by anything but two counter parties willingness to transact.

You guys vastly overestimate the interest in bitcoin from funds. I've heard of a few shops dabbling in it, but no big boys. It's too small and too illiquid. If a fund deployed a $50mm allocation to bitcoin (which is relative chump change) it would whipsaw the market.

The market cap has nothing to do with it. There are plenty of stocks with greater liquidity and smaller market caps.
@_date: 2014-04-11 01:53:23


You are mistaken (at least about what you're implying).
ELI5 for those of you who will ask: even the most efficient miners in the world have a breakeven cost. So these levels provide support else they risk disincentivizing new supply completely. Markets routinely correct below these levels, in order to de-stock market supplies or remove high cost production. When this happens, supply shrinks and the market readjusts to a new equilibrium. But the difference is that while technological advancements are made which improve mining efficiency, they are generally fixed. So if the market wants more of [copper/gold/iron ore/alumina/etc] mined it will *have* to pay a certain price.
Bitcoin however, doesn't have this. The supply is constant. As price falls, high cost miners remove themselves once price is below marginal cost of production. As the network loses hashing power, the difficulty readjusts down, and mining output remains constant.
**TL;DR It doesn't matter how much it costs miners to mine bitcoin, it will not provide any price support. The design of the network makes it such.**

Pure arbitrage depends on a relatively free flow of assets. This is the "Law of One Price". Minor differences between exchanges account for the fact that there are fees, taxes, etc with moving fiat and bitcoin.
With Gox though, you can't get anything out at the moment. That's the largest impediment. So if you want to arb the spread, you are also taking on (what is at least perceived as) the substantial credit risk of Gox.

The tax code is extremely complicated. I am a trader by trade, but also have a personal account that I actively trade. I had to set up an LLC to handle my trading, solely for tax purposes.
If you are transacting in bitcoin frequently, there are a plethora of rule (i.e. wash sales) that will massively penalize the average Joe filing as an individual (and thus their trading activity as a sole prop).
Businesses have much broader ability to write off expenses than do individuals. IANAL but I doubt this has significant (if any) impact on their ability to claim a loss. Also, people here seriously overestimate the amount of "big players" currently with bitcoin positions. And those that do, generally have teeny tiny exposure and it is used primarily as a marketing tool (especially now that hedge funds can advertise).

You misunderstood. I'm saying that offer cancellations will mean the price will jump immediately, instead of leaving a fleeting opportunity for arbitragers to quickly buy. So I agree with you there.
But other exchanges are likely to see significant selling pressure. How well this is absorbed is anyone's guess.
Also just to correct you, trading is zero sum. The reason we have had "several days of people buying tens of thousands of significantly cheaper bitcoins" is because others having been selling into those bids. Someone will wind up being right. I don't have any sort of edge in terms of who that is.

I have made the same comment multiple times. The usual answer is that in the event of bankruptcy proceedings, making a claim on fiat may be easier than on bitcoin.
But since they are a virtual exchange for a virtual currency, it is unlikely they have any assets to liquidate. So if they're insolvent, 99% chance you're screwed either way. But if they're not, people are locking in huge realized losses.

This isn't true at all. Yes, we were very close to disaster. Talking about gross notional value of derivatives is dumb, but was also one of the risks and why there is a push to move things to clearing houses (which provide a back stop). But gross notional figures are misleading. If you and I trade a $1B OTC swap back and forth 1,000 times, is there now $1T worth of risk? No. But since it's not cleared, the gross notional is $1T.
**The bigger problem, is your straw man argument. My point was how important clearing houses are. What you refer to wasn't cleared. It also has nothing to do with MF Global, or the fact that MF Global funds were basically recovered 100 cents on the dollar.**

You also don't seem to realize that the $100k was for a group of companies (they don't just own a bar, it's hotels, etc) and $100k in *revenue* (not profit) is peanuts.

You're ignoring the issue. That has nothing to do with it. Taking my business elsewhere does not explain why I would conduct additional behavior (i.e. selling) on MtGox.
Look, maybe it's because I do this all day and I'm not doing a good enough job explaining. But spreads in many markets are actually more important than the absolute prices. So it does matter.
*EDIT* Just to add this: exchanges all around the globe trade the same things. The prices tend to vary to a small degree, and typically follow the no-arbitrage argument adjusted for cost of capital, carry, taxes, etc. Many of the exchanges have low volumes (i.e. SGX gold volumes very low compared to COMEX) but the spreads don't "blow out" simply because most people are doing business elsewhere. Reason being: there is money to be made.

Yes, I agree. How much is always the question. But the problem with deflation is the structure of economies. In developed nations, economies are driven by consumption (whereas developing are general driven by investment).
This makes inflation preferable since it encourages consumption. Deflation discourages consumption. So in broad strokes terms, moderate inflation is always preferable to moderate deflation. You can debate the theory behind it, but an examination of recent history would also agree (see Japan's lost decade due to stagflation).

He's also grasping at straws, especially talking about fees which are actually a horrible *downside* to bitcoin. The fee structures are only complex for those who want complexity. Most retail brokerages are $7-10 each way for stocks.
I made this point in another thread: I can go buy millions in forex for a few bucks. The same trade would cost thousands just in fees for bitcoin. Or futures: generally comission is $1-2 each way, and notional value is often ~$100k.
Or even using OP's example: I go to my Fidelity account, and buy 200 shares of AAPL for $100k. Costs me $8. The same for bitcoin? $200. And bitcoin doesn't have all of the regulatory overhead and custodial issues that stocks do.
**TL;DR Bitcoin trading fees are INSANELY high unless you're a young kid who's playing around with $500**

Investing and trading is all about risk management. That's what makes the greats great. *Nobody* is right every time. The difference is that he saw asymmetric risk, put on a position, ***sized it properly*** (i.e. ultra high risk = smaller position), and he'll be fine. It's the perfect investment which is why he took it. It's no different than venture capital. If it takes off, you earn many multiples of your small investment. If it fails, you lose a small investment.

Just wanted to chime in since I like your post:
 - Yes, it's a total PITA. But at least it exists. There are no retroactive consumer protections in bitcoin. You have to layer escrow, etc on top of it and then you start circling back to modern day financial institutions. You touch on it in  but fail to recognize that a credit card *is* escrow. People use fiat escrow *all the time* without realizing it.
 - This I think is the game changer. I don't think BTC will rise to the level many here do, but I do think it will force massive competition in the current system (which, if bitcoin accomplishes nothing more, will still be a huge success).
 - Bank vaults get robbed. The most secure networks get hacked. I think this is short sighted.

Sigh. I work in finance. Do you have a source or proof?
@_date: 2014-02-16 12:36:02
No, they do. But consider this: I place a buy order for 1k bitcoins. Someone comes and sells 10. Then someone else sells 25. Then another guy sells 50. Well, after I absorb these 85 BTC I simply decide that the market wants to move down, so I cancel my remaining 915 order.
Typically it's bots that are doing this, so as soon as someone starts selling to them, they get order confirmations, and cancel rapidly. But usually they have no intention of buying the shown amount. This stuff has been going on in financial markets for years. And there's actually another order type in financial markets called "iceberg" which does the opposite (I place an order for 1,000 but it only shows 10 at a time or however many I want it to show...this avoids spooking the market the other way if you genuinely want to execute a 1,000 buy).

Yes, they do. The govt tried to prop up the peso at ludicrous levels. So, the "official" peso was not a currency in that sense since the market traded a completely different rate.
Once they capitulated and released their failing control, the market repriced significantly. Volatility should subside. But you're also talking about a MASSIVE move in an emerging currency that has a history of default...vs. what would otherwise be rather dull vol for bitcoin.

I am bearish right now since the current bitcoin economy could not support these prices. Long term, I am skeptical.

@_date: 2014-04-11 15:33:31
I never said they were hurting. I said they had lost money.
But god, these comments make me cringe. If you invested $100 today, and in 5 years it was worth $1,000. Then in year 6, it lost 90% of its value, would you not consider that a loss (ignoring inflation and TVM).
The fact is that any time an asset declines, people lose money. Not selling is no different than buying. If BTC is at $1,000 and you don't sell, it's no different from buying.
This is where bitcoin needs to grow up. FFS, people don't just look at entry points to evaluate returns.
@_date: 2014-04-12 09:30:08
Lashing out? Towards whom? Merely stating the obvious here. I have no stake in any of this career-wise.
I'm just curious. What's your current position size and avg cost? What may surprise you to hear is that I got into finance after starting a tech company in high school (and later losing money in the Great Recession piquing my interest in finance). I was also really early into bitcoin (I still remember when I first heard about it on /.) and mined a bit when CPU mining was still possible. I never had all that much (~100 coins) but bitcoin wasn't really gaining momentum. I lost the keys and lost interest.
Then bitcoin blows up. Becomes an international sensation. Do I wish I had those coins? Sure. Did I buy a bunch on the way up? Yep (forget exactly when...it was on Gox so can't see now...but it was on one of the last crashes before the huge run and I had an average fill of around $70 scaling in). I flipped those for $350, obviously leaving a ton on the table.
So no, I don't fit any mold. I never have. I fell into finance accidentally. You don't know me. I have been following bitcoin since near inception. I have made money on both sides of the trade. Do I believe that bitcoin has a future? Absolutely. Read all my comments. None of them say it's worthless or doomed. My entire thesis has been it's overvaluation based on current market dynamics. This has largely proven true. Could I have made more money by being a HODLER and selling out at $1,000...in hindsight, obviously yes. But the risk/reward *in my opinion* didn't justify it. I think it's starting to justify a long position again. Plus, there is much more investment activity around bitcoin that I can put $10k as cheap options with no theta decay. Again, bitcoin didn't have that a year ago. So even though it's more expensive now, the risk symmetry is much more attractive.
So since you are so quick to write me off as some butthurt stereotype, how about a little food for though. Maybe more people around here will come to their senses and realize that an overnight rally to whatever the long term price will be is not healthy. Maybe they will realize having opposing beliefs is healthy and that you can be conservatively optimistic while being short term bearish. Everyone need not be a TO DA MOON'er.

Not it's not. It's not different at all. It's an asset, just like any commodity, stock, currency, derivative, PE, debt, etc. It's not a *bitcoin book*. It's just a book with a small bitcoin position.
Plus, the sad truth is that it's cheap marketing. Hedge funds can now advertise, and it's cheap differentiation to your LPs to say "We trade bitcoin". Well, at least it was a couple months ago. Bitcoin has quickly lost interest from limiteds in the last two months. That may reverse, but the current environment is not rosy.
Surely you can appreciate that merely stating it's "entirely different" without actually explaining why is completely worthless.

Good question. In this case, the "mining" analogy works quite well. Let me explain what happens with real miners first:
Within any production sector, there is a cost curve meaning that participants have varying costs to produce an additional unit of a good. When market price falls below marginal cost of production, the high cost miners shut down capacity. This in turn reduces supply. Now, in copper/aluminum/coal/iron ore/etc, demand actually consumes supply. So as the miners reduce supply, but end users continue consuming, it eventually brings price support back to the market. This is how a structural oversupply would get resolved (in theory).
Bitcoin does not have consumptive demand. That is the problem here. Miners will absolutely shut off supply (since if the act of mining as marginally cash flow negative, there is no reason to continue) but that does not necessarily reduce new supply (since the network will readjust difficulty). Then you add to the mix that bitcoins are not consumed, and it makes for a rather sticky situation for miners.
But, just like for a real miner, the low cost guys will continue to operate. Since the difficulty will readjust, it becomes less and less computationally intensive (and therefore less expensive) to verify transactions, people will continue to mine.

Low transaction fees? Are you kidding me? Bitcoin exchanges have some of the highest fees for financial instruments I've seen. If you're just converting one way, they're not bad. Or if you trade small size, the lack of minimum fee also helps. But if you're actively trading, they're obscene. 0.5% for a round trip trade on BTC-e? I can go trade $1mm EURUSD in my Interactive Brokers account for $4. A $1mm BTCUSD trade would cost $5,000. Hell, even call it $10k since bitcoin is a smaller market. It's still $4 vs $50. Nuts.

Most people lose money by trading. Because most people do what others are doing. It's very difficult trading momentum. Most real trading involves being contrarian and being contrarian is uncomfortable.
I am a trader by trade, so I have a little more comfort with this, but it never really goes away. You just have to learn to harness it. A good rule of thumb is that whenever you get that gut feeling in your stomach after watching a violent move that says "omg I have to buy/sell now!"...do the opposite.
Why? By the time you feel that, so have tons of other people who are all doing the exact same thing. And once everyone has bot/sld then there is nobody else left to continue the trend. This is why retail has an incredible ability to pick highs/lows...they just happen to be on the wrong side of the trade.
Now, you need to put this in the context of valuation and fundamentals (don't buy an overvalued asset just because people are panic selling). But it's a great, simple rule of thumb for timing entries that doesn't require understanding of technical analysis, indicators, etc.

Yes but the withdrawals being disabled introduces an entirely new risk that is not part of the arb. This is the credit risk I was referring to. What you are talking about it absolutely possible, but it's not an arbitrage since the price difference is explained (i.e. uncertainty over Gox solvency). So it's not an arbitrage since the lack of withdrawals makes one BTC on Gox a very different asset than one BTC on another exchange.

Also, a little snooping. I see you like to post Thinkorswim charts (actually, we may agree on this: awful broker but best retail charting software out there, really just below Bloomberg).
Pulling up spot VIX and saying the stock market is volatile is a logical fallacy. First, the chart will just show you the hist vol of vol itself. Yes, the vol of vol is quite volatile. Second, the VIX is spot ATM implied volatility, not realized volatility. It is merely a measure of expectations of future volatility, and a rather poor one at that. Looking at VX futures was well as spot VIX paints a better picture, but still not great. Usually when VIX spikes it's because unhedged participants are panic buying protection, or dumping on MM bids who then buy vol. Just a friendly FYI from your neighborhood "poor hedgie".

If bitcoin does indeed become a piece of the modern financial system, traders will flock to an exchange which is geographically close to other trading platforms due to latency. In the US that means either Chicago or New Jersey.

These broad strokes comments like "centralized BS" really miss the issue. Decentralization is not always the solution.
They both have pros and cons. But it's like the people who say boo inflation is ALWAYS evil. No.

Thanks for the kind words.
I work for a hedge fund, so I normally can't say much. But since we don't trade bitcoin (yet) I wanted to take the opportunity to give back and educate people. Markets work best when participants are informed.

Regardless of net worth, etc there is a good rule of thumb for risk management that no investment is worth losing sleep over. If you are, then most certainly your risk profile is over extended.

Ha ok no worries. No, my username was meant more in the sense of "I was wrong once. And only once."

I didn't say that you weren't seeing two different IPs. Just that it doesn't mean your traffic is being hijacked.
Are you on WiFi? Maybe the phone's reported IP is wrong?
It's called confirmation bias, and I think it's happening here.

I have nothing at Gox. But I wish I did. The risk/reward is too juicy right now.

Completely valid. Probably the most responsible answer.

You have to realize that a huge majority of bitcoin's price was speculation. The actual consumptive demand would price it much lower.
You are seeing specs profit take and head for the exit.

Just as a speculator will take delivery if the price discovery is wrong. That's what a speculator does. It doesn't matter if I take delivery because I want to make cupcakes or because I think the price will go up tomorrow. The market still functions. That's my point. But keep calling me a retard. I do this shit all day while you troll Enjoy your pathetic existence.

Supply constraint (despite the marketing points for bitcoin) is vastly over estimated. The protocol will only recognize 21m coins. But that doesn't mean than only 21m will exist in the bitcoin economy. But I digress...
Anyway, you've changed your argument from liquidity to float. So like I said in my original comment, you're a bit confused (or just being lazy with terminology). I don't disagree with what you've said after, especially since you've agreed with my sticking point.

You are referring to US law. MtGox filed in Japan.

Unlimited fiat wouldn't let you naked short sell (unlimited BTC would). Unlimited fiat would give you unlimited margin to buy bitcoin...

Completely agree with you. I'm not a bitcoin kool aid drinker...but I'd love to be proven wrong.

Completely feasible. I'm an American living in Singapore, and CFDs are illegal in the US (fortunately, I was able to get access). But that was how I was trading the Gox spread when it traded at a premium. Those were my best trades so far.
But to your theory, the CFDs that I had access to settled to Gox. So shorting CFDs while selling size on Gox would be an easy way to effectively get your money out if you were convinced they were insolvent.

You have it backwards. The value isn't the source code. The value is the output.

Of course. What a fantastically logical argument you just made. The fact that some have gotten away with other crimes has no bearing here. It just means that enforcement is crap.

Hyperbole does not imply the argument isn't real. Nobody spending is just one part of the "discouraging spending" spectrum. The likelihood of such a scenario is up for debate.

Management of the dollar is regulated? Buddy, you know not what you speak of. The dollar floats against every major currency (except the CNY). So no, that same couldn't be said because the exchanges are well managed and clear through massive clearing houses.
You are correct in that this is one of the risks of bitcoin. But you understanding seems very limited.
Disclosure: I am short BTC.
@_date: 2014-02-25 14:32:56
No. Just pointing out how ridiculous it is: "I have studied this for weeks on end, preparing for the inevitable, and I have reached the conclusion that the price is likely to either go up...*or down*. Now I can't be sure, but that's what the science suggests."

Right of course, merchant adoption...so this is actually good for bitcoin. facepalm.jpg
This is nothing more than a correction from a massive speculative bubble. It is fundamental repricing in the short and medium term that is *necessary* to achieve the goals that many evangelists whole heartedly believe in.
When bitcoin rallies, it's good for bitcoin. When it plunges, it's also good for bitcoin. What the fuck. At least be sensible. You can't have your cake and eat it too. These are the same people who if it crashed to zero and they lost everything, would be screaming "OMG LOOK HOW CHEAP IT IS!!!!"
I'll go wait in the corner for my downvotes.
@_date: 2014-03-07 01:40:23
You're splitting hairs on the terminology since all the arguments here are predicated on bitcoin gaining traction, otherwise who cares? But you just proved my point anyway.
If you believe that there is no difference between positive real rates and negative real rates (which is what you implied by saying there is "no real difference" between inflation and deflation) then I have no clue what kind of basic classical economics you're referring to.
@_date: 2014-02-16 12:01:46
There are two separate forces. One would absolutely happen, and the latter *may* happen.
1) Arbitragers would immediately buy Gox and sell other exchanges, narrowing the spread. This would likely evaporate quickly as much of the current Gox offer stack (sell orders) would be cancelled.
2) Sentiment changes towards bitcoin. People jump back in feeling more secure, and all prices move up. Or, it becomes a sell the news event where many people were holding on to BTC anticipating the withdrawals (thus inflating price on other exchanges), and once they happen, everyone sells at once.

I said that even with proper cold/hot opsec etc, that this still leaves a huge gap in protection. It's not better than the alternatives *because there is no recourse*. If you don't ever lose bitcoin, great. But if you do, you're up shit creek. This is why programs like the FDIC exist.

Upvote for calling it a bid.
The bitcoin nomenclature really highlights the lack of experience and market understanding.

I don't know what price they bought, I just said I know their average cost. It's simple math. We know that their cash flows for BTC were $20mm for the quarter on Dec 31 their position was worth $16.298mm or 81.49% of the original cash flow. Take the price on Dec 31 (ball park $725) and divide by .8149 to give the average cost of $890.
@_date: 2015-05-26 19:11:29


We can't catch every single infraction...the cost/benefit analysis just won't allow it. Whether or not you agree with the laws, it is a false equivalency to argue that our government should not prioritize law enforcement, and this was law breaking on a commercial scale.

That's not what a market is supposed to do. Obviously, I can make more money trading against lesser informed participants. But the job of an efficient market is to facilitate price discovery. People can only make money in inefficient markets.
But the libertarian in me seeks perfectly efficient markets. I would be out of a job, but society would be better off.

Futures *can* have steep carry in certain markets and certain conditions. But that doesn't mean that all do. People buy an ETF often not understanding what underlies it. Retail buys USO (WTI ETF) thinking they just have a "thing" that goes up when oil goes up. They don't understand that in reality that they actually own oil, or at least a paper proxy. The no arbitrage argument for pricing futures necessarily means that cost of carry influence the structure of the curve. So you buy an oil ETF and forget that it costs money each month to store your oil.
However financial products are typically different since cost of carry is much lower. Look at FX ETFs. They are influenced by rates and financing, but to a lesser degree.
Point being that regardless of whether you trade cash, futures or ETFs, they are no free lunches. Even owning a bitcoin (cash/spot) has a cost of carry (opportunity cost) that most people don't factor in.
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:30:43
That's not how that works. Futures are zero sum. The net position of a futures market is flat.
