You know how a lotto machine works, when you make a quick pick? It gives you a few random numbers right? But those may or may not be the winning numbers. Hashing is how miners try to win the next block. The more random numbers they can generate, the better chance they have at finding the winning numbers.
So some cards are like the lotto machines choosing random numbers. But some cards can work faster or slower than others, and some people have warehouses full of the machines.
Now when anyone can run their own lotto, it may be easier to find the winning numbers on their network. The lotto machines are all connected and know how many there are on the network. So If more people have lotto machines, they add more numbers to have to guess to make it fair for everyone.

I don't think I believe you at all. Are you asking if you can use the same seed with both? You imported the seed and you are wondering why it worked?

Most wallets generate a new receiving address, so its empty until you have funds sent to it. No one can compromise it with the receiving address.

Yes. Exchanges are 'trust' services. Just like a bank could freeze your account, they can too. Bitcoin itself is 'trustless' protocol. When you hold the 'private keys' in a personal wallet (On a phone, PC, or specific hardware wallet) you are in control. The BTC deposit address is theirs, so they move the bitcoin offline to a cold storage address or they sell it to someone else.

Yeah, that is what all the links and discussion that followed says.
@_date: 2017-12-04 00:39:41
As I see it, here's where you are:
* Sent to some other address you don't own
* Derivation path issue
* Multibit / Breadwallet bug
So either a bug or breadwallet created different change addresses than multibit did. 
I'm still leaning toward a software conflict and one of the two wallets could generate your private key somehow.. theres a bunch of bip39 &amp; bip32 tools out there but be careful.
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:16:11
May not have been marked RBF. Do you have access to the receiving wallet? If so you can do a CPFP. Otherwise you have to wait for it to process or drop from the mempool at 2 weeks or longer if someone rebroadcasts it.

Not sure if it's still true but FYI: Bitcoin Days Destroyed. Older coins (coming from older transactions) are conventionally assigned higher priority, and thus will generally be included in a block sooner.
*Exchanges are off-chain, and so the coin they send you may not actually be 'old' like it has in your account balance on their site.
21+ sat/byte fees seem to clear regularly while anything below that can be a long shot during this current adoption phase were in.
Me: I'd move coinbase and bittrex to the electrum wallet. Make sure the seed is backed up.
@_date: 2017-12-04 03:15:39
How old? If a more than a few months, don't forget to move your BCH and BTG as they will stay at their old address.
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:08:23
If you can't or don't want to do RBF or CPFP then yes. But it's 'safe' in that it will either be sent, or sent back to you eventually.
@_date: 2017-12-09 22:44:48
I hate to give you more information than you need, but each address can have multiple 'inputs' (many transactions to the same address) vs one tx per address. The many inputs one costs more to send.
If you had a $20 and had to get change, you give the store the 20, then they give you back your change. Bitcoin kinda works the same way. If you are spending, it grabs some inputs, enough to be equal or over the amount you are sending, and sends the change back to a new address.
When you say 'I didn't need to send the whole balance" It automatically does it if you have a single large input.
Just trying to give you an idea of how things work. When you send a little 'minimal amount' you are breaking up a larger input, making it cost more to send later on...
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:09:23
All receiving addresses should always be valid for your backup. Are you saying you received to the same address twice? This is fine.
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:46:14
Well it wasn't the last 2 blocks... it should be shortly tx seem to be clearing up and you have pretty good fees. With all the tx accelerators people are jumping ahead sometimes.
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:01:48
CPFP. The receiving address can send to itself, with a higher fee causing both tx to be picked up. You might just want to wait as it's still pretty pricey to send right now.

Takes 2 weeks to drop from the mempool, if not rebroadcast (by anyone).

@_date: 2017-12-09 17:11:27
Just to note, these wait's should be temporary. You can see many points in the second link where cheap fee's were abundant. The dev's are working on new ways to prevent these filled blocks, so the current speed &amp; fees are abnormal to the way things ***should*** work.

Not sure whats going on here.. Hmmm... iancoleman should be fine.
@_date: 2017-12-02 19:15:33
Hashing algorithms have different 'rounds' of calculations to do, so it depends on which coin you are mining.
@_date: 2017-12-04 19:58:47
FYI: Bitcoin has a notion of Bitcoin Days Destroyed which prioritizes transactions spending older coins. Miners are not forced to employ this strategy (by the protocol), but they do so because it's good for the network, and thus for them. That's why you can observe a huge variance in the time it takes to confirm otherwise look-alike transactions with low or no fees.
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:35:54
It looks like it should clear pretty quickly without.. any moment
@_date: 2017-12-02 20:26:58
Difficulty changes every 2016 blocks, so if they come on or off the network it can make it easier or harder to find a block during those times.
If more miners join, you find blocks faster until the difficulty change.
If miners leave, you will find blocks slower until the difficulty change.
It's hard to give you a yes or no, due to those outcomes. The protocol goal is 10 minutes average, and it is controlled by that block rate.
Adoption has grown, so capacity of the block needs to grow, or other adaptions such as side chains.
Owning a miner helps keep difficulty high enough so that a pool of miners cant take over the network by coming on and off.
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:30:28
Yeah, if the miner "see's" the fee chain is worth it, they include all of them. See's = programmed into mining software.

If the price recovers before you sell out, sell enough to break even and leave the rest in. Then DO NOT use credit to make speculative investments. Would you have done the same thing with the lotto if it were at an all time high?

If you can wait, you should wait before sending.
0-X are currently processing fees. It will move up the page as transactions clear. You can pay now or wait, for the same fee and it should be fine. If you don't want to see it in limbo though, just wait until the fee you want to pay is in that range on that page.

It seems his singular argument is that in regards to scaling he thinks blocksize is the only important metric.
Performance of the software itself is also paramount. How large can the mempool get for the software, or for the PC it's being run on. It's not just more hard drive space that is needed for the network to function and perform properly for it to work for 'Everyone'. There are many improvements to performance bcash will never be able to implement without re-creating things like Segwit.

Binance is an exchange. Is this the deposit address of your account? They own the private keys and probably are moving it. When you withdraw it will come from another address they own. Only your deposit to them, and when they send btc out, is on the blockchain. Everything you do with your account is internal to their system.

Check the first link. See where its 401-410, and the 0-X on the right? Those and above (fee wise) will probably be in the next block. The fee is to try and get you in the next block. If you don't need to be in the next block you can try to set it lower, but others can spend more and get ahead of you in line.
@_date: 2017-12-02 17:59:07

Confuser thinks he can get a private key to any address by just modifying the vanitygen program, which finds addresses beginning with just a few letters/numbers.

When you use segwit, your tx size is smaller in the block, creating more Transactions Per Second. The more you can fit into a block, the less the fees per tx are. It's about scaling and not direct fees. Segwit also enables lightning, which will have direct impact on fees.

You may want to 'sweep' instead of import. Sweeping is a transaction and will move the funds to the new wallet. Import will leave them on the paper wallet. If you delete that new wallet for some reason and try to restore it, the seed won't recover the imported private key. If you sweep, you will have it backed up with the new wallets seed.

Address = Hash of private key (Not keyS)
Blockchain.info is one wallet with a bunch of addresses, localbitcoins is another. Electrum is YOUR wallet. They are all 'yours' but one is hosted on your computer and the others are not.
When you send from blockchain.info to electrum, you are basically choosing which private keys allow your coins to be moved on the network. The blockchain files that the miners create are storing the location of the coins, while your private keys allow them to move.

Change has nothing to do with fee's. Fee's are for priority transacting on the network. You can pay a really low fee and have your transaction wait for the network to clear up before it will be put into a block (get a confirmation).
Change is so that you don't send and receive using the same public address. If I send you bitcoin to an address, and you continue to use that single address, I can follow the blockchain and see when you spend or transfer your bitcoin elsewhere. Would you want someone knowing how many bitcoin you hold? Or see how often you use it? Or any other data that can be gathered that way?
*Edit: It's also how bitcoin works. If you have a $100 bill, you have to give it to a merchant, and they give you change. When you spend from an address that has more than you are spending, the change goes to a new address. This is separate from change, but still relevant to the topic.

I guess you have 19 more 2fa's to use if you don't. Then you at least get what you paid for. Probably a reason they wouldn't refund you unless they can blacklist the keys they control to stop 2fa from sending you the code.

BTCRecover is for encrypted private keys. It tries to guess the passphrase you used to encrypt the private keys.

How 'lost' is it? Can you give any details and maybe there is a chance, or are you sure it's gone?

Child pays for parent. The receiver can 'send to themselves' and pay a higher fee to get both transactions picked up.

1% fee.
