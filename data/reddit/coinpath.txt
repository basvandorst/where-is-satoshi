It's really nice but the B is a bit subtle, re work it a bit and it could be excellent

Incoming transactions can be sent anyone and we've seen transactions that have tens of thousands of outputs all with 1 satoshi into seemingly random addresses, potentially as part of network spam.
Taking this into consideration outgoing transactions seemed to be the right choice, as it could only be initiated by someone with the private key.

We will however look to take into account some incoming transactions as long as they exceed certain amounts of BTC. With this in mind 1 year should still be acceptable.

Oh yeah, those are nasty. Drop bear removal is at least 5 btc if you get one on your property.

We're looking to add incoming transactions above a certain BTC amount into the mix also, but if you have any suggestions on a better way to gauge the amount of lost BTC we're open to any ideas.

In complete agreement with you, plus no idea if satoshi will ever move his.

Any suggestions?

I've sent you a message, the charity is st jude childrens research hospital for children with cancer.

We're still pretty early in the blockchain so a majority haven't moved since then anyway or never.
No guarantee satoshi still has their keys or ever had them, if we were to remove satoshi we'd have to remove almost everyone else too (unless the owner somehow declared the address lost, with no way of confirming as they no longer have access to their private keys)

Considering your feedback I'll look to build a stats page, there I'll add in the varying amounts of addresses and the BTC they contain based on different settings such as time since outgoing/incoming etc.
I'll still promote a single number on the homepage but this would allow you to pick a number you feel is correct.
edit: feel free to search for your addresses and see if they're considered lost or not with the current format.

Our crawler started at block 1 and is making it's way through the entire blockchain, so yes it likely includes all of satoshi's addresses.

Thanks, hopefully using the suggestion from Poldi-1 it would reduce this number.
@_date: 2017-12-27 08:22:42
Good suggestion thanks for the feedback, I'll look to get this implemented.

Beer in Australia is so expensive, the price is nearing 1 btc.
Moved here a couple of years ago, getting drunk can bankrupt me.

True but it's a common occurrence that people think they can only buy 1 bitcoin as people generally like whole numbers.
Because of this I believe there will always be a preference to own a whole bitcoin over a partial bitcoin. (until such time as it becomes unfeasible).

Send some toys to a childrens charity for me please!

Compare the fees between exchanges, transfer it to an exchange and cash out.
Unfortunately fees are a given, your alternative is through localbitcoins but you open yourself up to scams.

GDAX is very popular, but search around depending on the country you're in
