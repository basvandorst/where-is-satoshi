This is Bitmain's official Reddit account.
This is not a phone home.
This app is a test tool for hashboard, those url string "bindminers.bitmain.com" are just variables defined as common global variables inside, but is not used in the miner.
*anyone can start miner and capture network package on it, then can check and watch the data stream on the network of miner. There is no connection to any xxx.bitmain.com. only pool stratum.
*This single-board-test will be open source too, this test code has been implemented in the bmminer app already. we can see the test patten results of hashboard in the kernel log webpage.

* In the factory, we use single-board-test to check the hashboard quality, and will record the hashrate on the server.  At first we use  to collect the hashbaord's hashrate,  now we change to use internal server  to collect hashrate.
* We have co-operation with third party company on miner's repair service. When repairing miner, they need use single-board-test to test hashboard too. We use   to make sure the third party is repairing the miners from our factory. This function has been shutdown by a micro definition control :  NEED_AUTH_SEARCHFREQ ,  because this is only for third party repairing team, not for consumer. But this url string is a global variable, so can find this string in the binary file single-board-test.
Here is the source-code on GitHub of the single-board test:
