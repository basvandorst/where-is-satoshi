I actually did that on purpose, kind of to set Bitcoin apart and encourage it. Do you think I should add the icons back? 
@_date: 2014-02-05 20:26:34
Thanks! Didn't know I had to click the Bitcoin icon
@_date: 2014-04-30 01:29:06
Well, I didnt break them on purpose, I just intended to have bitcoin stick out. Ill have to check it out.

When I went to purchase the pro version, I saw no Bitcoin payment option, what did I do wrong?
@_date: 2014-04-30 00:10:14
Thank you very much!

Thanks for your feedback! Ill look into making it more apparent that Bitcoin is accepted.

Yes, I actually use the Blockchain app. It's probably the best of all the wallets available for us iPhone users.

I can definitely get it for you if you want! Brand new site so I'm still adding products. 
Edit: Just added 3 month Playstation plus cards

Sounds like an awesome idea, but very expensive,  which means we would be donating a lot of money to you. We need some form of proof that the money wouldn't be going straight to your pocket!

I might place an order on your site tomorrow.
@_date: 2013-12-19 18:29:28
Thanks for pointing it out. I didn't really think about the costs. I'll knock the prices down and see if that attracts anyone.
Edit: Just lowered my prices, any really go much further than that.

This is what Mt. Gox is infamous for. It's nothing new for their transactions to take forever

What is the most popular/common website to purchase bitcoins? 
@_date: 2013-10-31 01:32:15
I love Gyft! Granted its not directly helping the bitcoin community because I'm just buying gift cards and ultimately using USD, I'm still spreading awareness because the waiters and those I'm with see me purchasing the voucher with bitcoin
@_date: 2013-12-19 05:55:15
Many more products soon to come! I know the site design is very basic right now, so I'll work on that soon. Let me know any products you are interested in seeing!
Edit: If using Alienblue to view the site, it won't load until you swipe down to switch it to browsing mode.

This is a neat find! How does it work without a flame?
@_date: 2013-10-25 01:06:24
Darn! I guess I'll have to try localbitcoins and pay with cash, but I'm terrified of meeting up with someone! Thanks anyway!

Heck, I'll start drinking Heineken just to support the move towards Bitcoin. Its a great way to expand their consumer base 
@_date: 2013-10-25 02:57:38
That's actually a good idea. If I posted an Amazon gift card on Bitmit do you think it would go quickly, or would I be stuck waiting for days?
@_date: 2013-10-31 01:19:02
Why all the down votes? Did I miss something here?
