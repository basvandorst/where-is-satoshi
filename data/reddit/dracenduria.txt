Not really this is a small amount of time to wait on the phone to get the issue resolved. Less then 30 mins..I have spent hours on the phone with other merchants that i have paid using credit, something that has been around for 70 years. Truth be told it only took 5 days from order to my home when ordering with bitcoin, that's with the free shipping too.

Total story is it was a good buying experience and great support, also that UPS needs to handle packages better. Bitcoin works as a good currency of exchange. 
 
p.s. also fixed the time issue, so for those cynics out there now it wont eat away at your cold soul. Now lets all be happy bitcoin was picked up by a major online site and it is working out.

This is great news for developing countries. I cant wait till Bitcoin picks up in Africa and India.

I remember that, He said if anyone was arrested they would crash the economy as a punishment. Funny how that much money lets you get away with anything. Just like when Csnbc posted a news articale about a $43 trillion lawsuit and the next day the online editors kids were stabbed to death by the nanny and the nanny slit her throat so hard it broke her neck.

the prince has tons of money, careful however it is hard to hire a hit-man when you want them to put up $30000 first.

It was shipped in a brown box. It was labeled as a TV no pictures. It was UPS that was at fault, they need to be more gentle. It was good to hear all the praise the normal overstock employee puts into Bitcoin.      
@_date: 2014-02-18 02:03:24
ok i will check it out. I just hope it does not die like narrock.com did.

For now most people are giving refunds in fiat. After you spend the BTC your not losing out, you spent it at that value. That was your choice you chose to "cash out" the BTC for that item. Besides this wont be a issue once Bitcoin stabilizes with more adoption. It will take time though, lots of time.

So if you strip away everything that makes bitcoin, bitcoin it is like a private currency of old? well it is not a lie...

Not sure that's a wise step. Bad things happen when people try to buy oil with anything other than USD.

I have to start keeping better track of these things that was less than a hour away.

It will be hard to regulate BTC, all this means is will have to sell my BTC overseas then have it sent to my US bank account from a overseas account. so i guess they get there fees one way or another. 
After all it is all about the money.

you should be able to select the tab labeled Receive coins, create a new address there.  
@_date: 2013-10-24 23:24:36
so does that mean  [be next?

If they use this case as a precedent then the password is not protected. if they were to sell all the BTC at once the market would tank for a bit. 
@_date: 2013-12-09 02:30:38
wow they charge you for online banking. That's so wrong.
@_date: 2013-10-03 19:07:02
It is not that much of a blow. We have other places that use bitcoin now. Legal places that don't deal in Black markets. SR is not the only one of its kind either. If anything this just proves how bitcoin is becoming more stable and less prone to knee jerk reactions .  
@_date: 2013-11-24 19:24:32
Wow, that's a nice amount of BTC. Great investment, might want to writedown your password on a master list, just in case. I say take 50% and enjoy yourself, keep investing in BTC.

virwox is one i use, it takes paypal and CC. You do have to buy  Linden Dollars to convert to btc all together you lose about $4. the first  Linden Dollars to BTC can take a few days to verify your CC or paypal after that it is faster. I bought a bitcoin a few days ago took about 5 min from my paypal account.

edward lowery-major cyber criminal have yet to gravitate to bitcoin 
@_date: 2013-10-13 19:13:56

@_date: 2013-10-03 16:07:01
[This]( is how the will ask for his keys.

Thank you for keeping this place clean...But when you do find that Nigerien prices handing out BTC share the wealth.
