The irony is that this guy actually fits that bill, since he worked on classified projects.  
What he most likely didn't do is work on Bitcoin...

The lack of inflation and volatility is what really bugs me about BTC.  Yes, currencies float up and down against each other, but if you have a thousand dollars worth of dollars, yuan, yen, any major currency they don't go down against a basket of currencies by 50% in a matter of days.  
Belief that the currency will always go up cannot, cannot possibly be good for BTC, and the deflationary nature of the currency is obviously terrible for inequality.  (edit: and a trillion more important reasons.)  
So, no, if you're looking for me to argue with you, it's not gonna happen.  I'll just sit here fanboying because it's exciting and I can.

If his hash is jibberish, what stops him from saying, "it's not me?"
@_date: 2014-01-05 08:32:07
Eh, I ignored the top comment because it's nonsensical.  It's like being around a bunch of people claiming Flash is still somehow the top Terran in the world.  I know they're crazy, but I'm enough of a fanboy I'll just cheer with everyone else.
I WANT TO BELIEVE.

Ah, OK.  
Isn't that what you'd expect from someone who is described as incredibly reclusive and an ass, if you brought up:
1.  the NSA
2.  Moon landings
3.  The WTC towers
4.  absolutely anything whatsoever related to things that sound related to his past of classified/engineering work?
@_date: 2014-03-07 04:09:19
Oh, you could make a hell of a lot more than 15-30k.
Think of the maximum impact you could have on the bitcoin market by posting something, and how you'd make money off it.

Her forsenic examiner was trying to get at the idea that disk space doesn't matter anymore, since we have so much storage, and that he must be an "old-school" not relevant sort of mind still talking about such things - basically, seeing Satoshi as some old dude trying to optimize in Assembler for 640k of RAM.
If they had even minimal knowledge about the way BTC works now, they'd know the size of the blockchain is actually a meaningful concern and Satoshi was looking ahead to minimize it.
@_date: 2014-03-06 17:55:31
The problem is that much of this piece is based on his quoted statement that he is no longer involved.  If the wording was even slightly different, it could change meaning entirely.
@_date: 2014-03-07 04:02:22
The reporter isn't "lying", she adjusted the wording.
It's pretty fucking obvious from the beginning (check my post history) that the guy basically said:
I don't do any of those things anymore, other people do, go bug them, go away. 
@_date: 2014-03-08 09:04:08
I honestly have no reason to think it's him.  His behavior exactly matches what I would expect from someone fitting his profile who is not him, and it does not match the behavior I would expect from him.
1.  I do not expect Satoshi to use the same name as his real name despite effectively hiding himself in every other way, (and doing a hell of a lot of a better job of it than the Silk Round founder.) 
2.  If he was found, he would know exactly what was up when the reporter started emailing him.  He would be very unlikely to be confused and say senselessly self-incriminating things when the reporter showed up.   
I guess the main thing is that I have known several people his age or older who talk like he does when emotional. 
To be honest, just after I saw this story I would've taken 3-1 odds that he had nothing to do with bitcoin.  Now, I would consider 9-1.  
I think Satoshi can certainly more than take care of himself.  Dorian?  It feels like someone in the news media decided to start picking on one of my elderly neighbors for fun. 
@_date: 2014-01-05 05:33:59
Man, who pissed in your cheerios?  
Yeah, lots of people here are a little nuts, but sometimes being a little nuts is fun.  Let them be excited.  Who knows, maybe some of it will come true.
@_date: 2014-03-08 06:45:28
I have to ask, because you seem reasonable and most of the people I have heard profess that do not.
What is the evidence that led you to believe that, out of the population of the world, he in particular has a larger chance of being Satoshi than every other person combined? 
@_date: 2014-03-08 05:50:43
You severely underestimate the effect of telling every stupid person in the nation that a 64 year old man effectively has $400,000,000 in his basement.  
Shit, "mug the old man for his money" has been a common trope for hundreds of years - it might be fair to say thousands.
@_date: 2014-03-06 18:06:40
Note that I am not saying that he could not be Satoshi of Bitcoin.  
Rather, I think this behavior is also consistent with the behavior of a 64 year old man who is not Satoshi of Bitcoin, but is known to be reclusive and secretive, worked on classified projects in the past and had a stroke 3 months prior.
I suspect we will see more evidence either way soon enough; if I had to bet money on this right now with what I know at this moment, I would bet that he did not invent Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-03-07 00:04:59
Anyone who has talked to an elder, let alone a stroke victim, let alone a 64 year old man who may have grown up speaking a different language and had to learn the concept of tenses - 
has had times when they're expressing an opinion in a way that what they are trying to say is obvious but their word choice technically means something else.  
It is incredibly obvious that Mr. Nakamoto is trying to express the concept he has nothing to do with Bitcoin.
His reaction is incoherent if viewed in terms of the real Bitcoin creator being found out (which he would have known was coming for a long time, if he was living in LA under that name!)  
It makes perfect sense, however, if it's a man who wants nothing to do with this mess... which means they're tormenting an innocent man. 
@_date: 2014-03-07 01:55:43
I'd bet the actual conversation went something like this:
"So do you affirm that you are the creator of Bitcoin?" 
"NO!!  I don't work on any classified things like that anymore.  Other people do it, why don't you go bother them?  GO AWAY."
@_date: 2014-03-07 04:01:21
Do you seriously not know any people who constantly fuck up their wording like that?
@_date: 2014-03-08 22:49:36
" That so many people can refuse to believe he would make such a mistake, but fully believe he can think he's being ask about "classified work" when he was being asked about "Bitcoin."
They're saying Satoshi would not make such a mistake, but Dorian would.
@_date: 2014-03-09 02:06:12
That's the heart of the matter, then.  We have different expectations.
The second I saw what he said, I took it as a flat denial and extreme annoyance / wanting to be not bothered about such things or having them brought up.  
Either way, I look forward to seeing what happens with this.  Finding he actually is Satoshi would be much more exciting, but there are lots of things which would need a very good explanation.
@_date: 2014-03-08 20:43:10
You think that Satoshi predicted the rise of Bitcoin, built Bitcoin, used Tor for all his communications, and then came to the conclusion that a reporter hunting him down would leave him alone if he admitted that he made Bitcoin but claimed he was no longer involved?
Can you just please reply to this confirming that that is what you actually believe?
@_date: 2014-01-09 04:30:15
Sounds like a project which would require lots of research and field testing.
@_date: 2014-03-07 04:12:01
It does.  One major piece of evidence by the reporter is the allegation that Dorian did not deny.
Well, it was obvious from the wording that he was trying to.  
This just makes it more obvious.  Either he's outright lying, or he's some secret triple-crossing mastermind who put his name out in public and then tried to hide while doing everything else perfectly.
@_date: 2014-03-06 17:45:41
What if he's just a old guy who isn't all there who worked on classified projects in the past?
A reporter scammed their way into talking with him by taking advantage of his hobby, bugging him about things he doesn't really understand, and he just wants them to go away.  He says, "I don't do any of those things, I'm not involved with such stuff anymore."  
When people dismiss Newsweek, they're not dismissing the NYT, Guardian.  It went all-digital before being sold off entirely, and their reporting recently has not been the height of credibility.  
@_date: 2014-03-08 05:54:01
He's either faking ignorance, or he doesn't know enough about what bitcoin is to know what it would take to create it.
@_date: 2014-03-08 21:11:24
Tom Keene from Bloomberg had it in one when he said it all boils down to Bayesian stats.  
People are thinking, "Could this guy have done it?"  rather than "what are the odds this specific guy did it out of all the people in the world?  Is there anything we know sufficient to privilege him?"
@_date: 2011-06-05 07:37:56
The fact that if it doesn't it will revolutionize the way the world does business.
I hope it does.  I think it has a very damn good chance of doing so as far as things go.  However, I'll believe it when I see it happen.

You should be making 400+ with a decent clockrate on the GPU.
Even at 300, two hours @ 300 MH is more than 9 cents - about 80 cents, actually.  [proof!](
Huge consolation, I know.
@_date: 2011-06-28 17:25:37
I quit mining when the difficulty rate increases were enough that the annoyance of my GPU fan surpassed the pleasant feeling of seeing new bitcoins.  
@_date: 2011-06-08 18:05:56
Stability.  The main thing a competing pool needs is to not go down.
@_date: 2011-06-04 18:27:54
Right, at which case you're better just buying them outright.  Obviously each individual is fine buying them at current price / difficulty, but you can expect others to do likewise when price goes up so..
350 MH overclocked.  I'd have more bitcoins than I do but I started fairly recently and didn't bother to turn off hardware acceleration on flash / TV eps so it wasn't running some of the time =/

1440 stream processors as compared to the 5850's 960.  Think of it as having far more of the tiny cores that make up a GPU.
In exchange for using the 6850, you get a newer architecture with better tesselation performance and a cheaper price - the 5850 isn't all that much faster in games, between 6850 and 6870.  
However, bitcoin mining isn't quite the same as games.  It doesn't want lots of tesselation units, it doesn't want fancy GPU design, it wants brute stream processor force and the 5850 has that in spades.
Game comparison:  
@_date: 2011-06-08 18:16:42
you need a fast AMD graphics card.  That graphics card will download lots of codes and break them.  Eventually it will get a certain lucky result and can turn that in as proof and get bitcoins.

 2 days, @ 8.47 blocks/hour and 400 blocks.  Claim is that it won't go up by that much.. this time, but it's gone up by 70% in the past when people bought a shitload of mining gear at once.
It's hard to tell.  If bitcoins are The Currency and the price is real, then yes.  If this is a huge bubble and everyone's mining gear is arriving tomorrow by fedex, then difficulty will skyrocket.
@_date: 2011-06-07 21:49:03
That's over a dollar.

I'm running at 928 core, 718 memory, 1.149 volts. 
I would like to underclock the memory to 400-500 but that instantly hard locks the computer.  
@_date: 2011-06-04 18:56:22
Yeah; I presume you're mining with your CPU, then.  Performance is dependent on the brute force power of your GPU - CPUs don't have anywhere near the performance to compete with a GPU at a task the GPU can do well.
@_date: 2011-06-06 02:38:51
It completely avoids it - when you're dealing with bitcoins.
If you want to trade for dollars, you're going to have to go back to the rules.
@_date: 2011-06-04 23:18:57
Cash out some.  
The value could easily crash in five minutes.  In fact, odds are very good it will sooner or later. 
If you cash out none and it crashes to nothing, you're still heavily in debt and in a spiral of sadness because you could've been out.  If you sell off half your BC and they go up, you're not as rich as you could have been but you're still doing fine.  
@_date: 2011-06-04 18:18:14
Every weekishish.  The difficulty will adjust so that the same profits are returned no matter how much mining power there is.
Since people tend to buy in at a ton of mining gear just after a price increase, you would expect the next difficulty increase after this one to be insane - right now it's 400 going to 500ish, after that likely 700k-1m.  It won't stop, either.  Even if the price crashes, lots of people will just keep mining because they already have the gear.  
I'm mining with a 5850 I bought for gaming.  It goes about as high as you'd expect from one graphics card.  I think your best bet for bitcoin mining is to build a gaming rig, that way when the difficulty skyrockets or price crashes you can just keep playing awesome games.
@_date: 2011-06-10 22:08:18
That article seems to support his point.
"Even though the losses you incurred are unrealized, it doesn’t mean the losses aren’t real."
"If you have to sell it, you will get roughly $1,000. If you have $1,000 to invest, you can double your investment by buying 100 more shares. This has nothing to do with whether the gains or losses were realized or not."
In this case, losing unrealized gains is not a "fake" loss compared to losing realized gains, because you could have turned those gains into realized ones at any time.  
@_date: 2011-06-08 04:26:36
I'm in the middle, with a 5850 I bought for gaming just before bitcoin went big and I started mining.  
Sitting on 8 BTC, have no idea if it's going to burst down to 0 or keep going up.

What is he saying which is worth the time to read it?
Some people don't like BTC?  Ok, I knew that.
Many people on irrationally hate everyone who disagrees with them?  That's the human condition.
edit: thought you were talking about nobodybelievesyou, if you're talking about Krugman this doesn't apply
@_date: 2013-12-28 22:03:24
Krugman justifies "gold" as a store of value because it can be used to make jewelry. 
The price of gold is $1204 per ounce.  What is the price floor from its actual, physical uses?  It would have been nice if Krugman had spent some time justifying the idea that that floor is close enough to $1204 we should even take it into consideration.  
I say that the price floor of gold comes from tradition, history, and shared belief, which was *originally* buttressed by its physical characteristics.  
Is there any reason why bitcoin cannot be established in a similar way - like gold, a mass delusion, built on the back of its potential for actually being useful?
