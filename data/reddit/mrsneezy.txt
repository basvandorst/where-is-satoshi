Install electrum.  Get address from user you want to pay.  Send bitcoin instantly to address.  
I'm sorry but only a moron can't do that.

I think sidechains are GREAT!!  I'll just never use any services blockstream, it's investors, or any umbrella companies put forward as they attempt to be the first market movers.
Thanks Blockstream for the TECH!  You guys are so altruistic. 
@_date: 2015-09-08 01:45:52
I'll be sure not to use any sidechain offerings they have that will "speed up bitcoin". 
However, if they want to "create technologies" that competing companies not under their umbrella want to implement then I'll be sure to use those.
Thanks Blockstream!

I should have formed this company with Maxwell.  He must be a brilliant person if in one day he can get the idea for a business model, form a company and set it's direction.  I mean clear and out of the blue in October of 2014 huh?  Impressive.  
Clearly you're right though.  It's quit clear that he works well with others and is open to ideas that aren't in his best interest.
@_date: 2015-09-03 02:30:54
Gregory Maxwell is a fraud.  His only interest is lining his own pockets.  He does not care if bitcoin fails.  
I've had conversations with him on IRC in the bitcoin chat and he always, always, always came across as a know-it-all blowhard that refused to listen to anyone.  
It's quite clear now the whole clique in bitcoin IRC and here besides Gavin, Mike and the supporters of larger block sizes have ulterior motives.  
@_date: 2015-09-08 02:09:27
I would keep an open mind.  Things aren't always what they appear.  The profit motive is there for a group of developers/investors to stall mainline development so they can benefit from offchain transactions.
If you discover that's what this group is doing (I fully believe they are) hopefully you won't feel the same.  It's a shitty thing to do.

I'm sorry but you're a fucking idiot.  LMFAO!  There is SO MUCH wrong with ALL of this I'm not even going to address it.  I don't think you understand networking very well.
First, I've run several voip companies that provided home voip service.  This was my business.  I've seen home Internet providers specifically block port 5060 (SIP) which is not too bad as you can run sip over a different port.  Some just "inadvertently" enable SIP ALG on their routers as a "helper" service.  It never is and will bunk up your connection every time. However, and this is FAR worse, some of them look for SIP and RTP traffic signatures and will screw it up upstream.  I guess that's perfectly fine in your world. 
As far as port 25, grandma and the other absolute bs you wrote, ABSOUTELY.  There is nothing wrong with opening port 25 all day long AND no one is going to be browsing grandmas drives as that's what a 20 dollar firewall is for.  In fact, I don't think Internet providers should do anything but provide a public ip address and that's it.  Hell, I don't even think they should provide dns.  
Edit:  If they want to offer dns and a firewall/router then they should do so as recommended services and add an additional charge for it (this is part of hidden fees you're paying now anyhow).
@_date: 2015-09-08 01:46:31
Meh...whatever.  Folks will use sidechains...just not any Blockstream or it's umbrella companies profit off of.
Edit:  If people discover they stalled development to line their own pockets I think they'd agree with me.  It's a shitty thing to do.  They shouldn't be rewarded for that.
@_date: 2015-09-01 22:54:08
Blocking any port is bad and I hope they sue the pants off you guys.  There is NEVER, NEVER, NEVER, NEVER, NEVER, NEVER, NEVER, NEVER a reason to block any port.  
The most that should ever happen is a business should inform you that someone on your network is causing problems and you should investigate and take appropriate actions.


Sounds like Grandma should be charged more since she needs your "protection" and "services".  By the way, most ISPs simply have grandma plug her computer directly to the modem and if it works she can go fuck herself with any other problems she may have.  Everyone here knows this is true.
Other than that your ONLY concern should be latency and throughput.
As far as myopic views go, it is your view that is short sighted as hell.  Any measures to block ports is restricting freedom and will only result in ISPs regulating traffic to benefit their own business model and services at the expense of others.  In fact, I'd really have to listen to an argument for NOT taking measures if someone on your network was causing problems.
Anyhow we sit on opposite sides of this coin.  I shouldn't have said nasty things about you personally but this issue is really close to my heart.  I've seen WAY too much abuse of power that, in truth, is just slowing down humanity and progress.  The absolute WORST thing I've seen is when ISPs collude with local government to shut out other ISPs and form local monopolies.  Most people don't know how much this is costing them in terms of services and real money.  This should be illegal as hell and people should be thrown in jail.

No, that's NOT what they are doing AT ALL.  The investors intend for THEIR companies to be the primary providers based on first mover status and connections to the developers.  
The intent is to thwart bitcoin growth so people use the sidechains and they profit by being the deFacto providers.
@_date: 2015-09-08 01:42:12
All that money invested in them so they can't turn a profit.  Seems like a waste.  
@_date: 2015-09-08 02:02:22
NO.  The investors intend to provide services on the sidechains.  They have first mover status.  
Just watch what happens and look for the connections.
@_date: 2015-09-03 08:04:19
Lol...ask yourself why he did those things.  He works for blockstream.  Everything he's added has been to downplay bitcoin core and allow blockstream creations/services to take up the slack.  This is why he doesn't want larger block sizes.  This will lower the profit potential of blockstream.
He's a douche that wants to see bitcoin core become a neutered puppy so blockstream can benefit financially and he can line his douchey pockets.
@_date: 2015-09-01 19:26:15
Isn't this illegal now since it goes directly against net neutrality?
@_date: 2015-09-01 20:29:33
Yes, because home phone service isn't a business.   Also, people don't work at home nor have home businesses. 
See why net neutrality should do away with bullshit distinctions like that because in the modern world the lines are blurred and it's only used to hike up rates.
@_date: 2015-09-08 02:17:30
The investors want to be the first to provide offchain transactions.  You are right that it's my opinion the developers associated with blockstream are stalling core development.  However, I think anyone that's being objective can see it's odd that all the Blockstream folks are in lockstep with one another where larger blocks are concerned.  In truth, ANYTHING that allows bitcoin core to do what sidechains could do, they'll likely throw up roadblocks.  
The profit motive is there.
@_date: 2015-09-08 01:40:13
New account on reddit for 8 days.  Been using bitcoin since 2012. 
Makes a lot of sense..
@_date: 2015-09-08 01:57:48
You don't understand their INTENT.  Intent is extremely important.  They intend on being the first to offer sidechain services they profit off of.  They want to be the biggest provider and the deFacto source for offchain transactions.  They want to cripple bitcoin so they can accomplish this.  
These investors didn't line up so they could release open source code.
Always follow the money.  If you don't like how they are stalling bitcoin development then vote with your wallets when your have a chance.
@_date: 2015-09-08 02:21:05
Well the truth is you KNOW no one could provide evidence without illegally obtaining it or the Blockstream team slipping up.  However, absent this you can look at conventional things like motive and patterns.  The profit motive is CLEARLY there in being a first mover to provide off chain transactions.  The pattern is ALL the blockstream folks are in lockstep against larger blocks and LIKELY against Bitcoin Core providing anything that would compete with the businesses they establish.
Time will tell.  Come back in a few years and let's see who was right.
@_date: 2015-09-01 19:28:33
There are NEVER any legitimate ports to block.  FUCKING EVER.  I've had these bastards try to ruin voip businesses in the past.  Go fuck yourself for even suggesting this bullshit.
