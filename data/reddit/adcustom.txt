1. That certainly feels true. Wonder HOW governments would be able to "outlaw" it though.
2. Not sure I agree. Other "better" (in their opinion and in certain areas) cryptocurrencies have come along. But it's really hard to usurp the power of the existing Bitcoin network. 
3. Dang, reading that gave me a shiver. ��

Wow, it's legit depressing that there is NOTHING in New York City.

Hope your order went through.

Yeah, GDAX is the way to go. No fees. I also like Gemini a lot, but 1% for maker and taker trades.

The Square Cash app is by far the most user-friendly beginner way to get started buying and HODLing BTC.

"this has GOT to be the bottom"
"ok, THIS is the bottom."

Sadly, Robinhood does not yet allow you to transfer out your BTC to an external wallet.

Nice Sunday morning discount. Great dip to stock up on.
@_date: 2018-05-11 00:14:19
Was there just a huge Mt Gox dump?
@_date: 2018-05-12 15:54:17
Wow, how is that possible? Really hope that wasn't a credit card or debit card buy! ��
@_date: 2018-05-14 13:55:02
Consensus FOMO kicking in. See y'all on the moon.
@_date: 2018-05-02 19:02:06
Ah, thanks. I'll delete.

If anyone knows where in Midtown Manhattan I could get my hands on some pizza paid with bitcoin, hmu!
@_date: 2018-05-21 11:30:10
@_date: 2018-05-06 13:43:21
This is a GREAT dip to buy. 
@_date: 2018-05-23 17:41:21
Bwahahaha, I needed this.
@_date: 2018-05-21 20:30:28
You're bummed that Consensus didn't pump as hyped? Do you have any actual fear that Bitcoin doesn't have an absurdly bright future? My recommendation is to not trade on emotion, but rather keep educating yourself. Read books, not Reddit. Research development, not hourly price movements. If you don't have faith in the future and were just looking to make tons of money, you're better off pulling out.
@_date: 2018-05-19 19:53:21
I work in Midtown Manhattan and don't see anything at all. 
@_date: 2018-05-13 17:44:15
Thank you as always for the insightful comments, The BitcoinAlways.
@_date: 2018-05-07 14:20:02
I too would be interested in reading more on this. Though...couldn't some of these addresses be from institutions?

cryptoyum is a good reader and I like the devs.
@_date: 2018-05-01 00:42:02
Guhhhh, under $9K again...
@_date: 2018-05-12 14:33:44
I made that mistake once. Emotionally sold some, then immediately (literally two minutes later) realized how dumb it was and bought back the same amount. Ended up just being like a 2% loss after a slight increase in price and Gemini fee. Protip: transfer out of an exchange to a hardware wallet and then you won't be as tempted to panic sell in a moment of weakness.
@_date: 2018-05-23 17:42:08
so funny.
@_date: 2018-05-22 12:13:59
Looks pretty sketch.
@_date: 2018-05-02 19:58:37
Gotta say, I'm actually really grateful there's been substantial support at 9k.
@_date: 2018-05-23 16:30:05
Any good bcash memes y'all can share? I need a laugh.
@_date: 2018-05-15 11:55:34
You'll need to buy more than one coin, breh.
@_date: 2018-05-23 14:43:00
Gemini is great, but there is a 1% fee for both maker and taker.
@_date: 2018-05-06 13:42:40
I'd bet my life we're headed past $10k. Just a matter of when. Could still take a couple weeks. 
@_date: 2018-05-03 11:58:21
Pretty sure U doesn't come before B.
@_date: 2018-05-10 23:41:51
Kinda getting terrified of it dipping below 9K. Support has been really strong, but man...

@_date: 2018-06-10 18:47:16
You are down $25 and felt the need to make a post? lolol

@_date: 2018-06-08 21:47:19
Cool idea, thanks for sharing, here's a free 0.1 BTC!
@_date: 2018-06-03 13:04:54
Gotta say...I'm quite glad that the price has been *steadily* increasing over the past few days. Feels like we did hit a bottom at 7K.
@_date: 2018-06-10 02:25:17
BTFD again.

I didn't buy a full Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-03-12 23:34:05
Wow. Certainly that wasn't within the past month though?
@_date: 2018-03-12 16:39:19
I did not buy a full bitcoin, sorry if my title made it seem that way.
@_date: 2018-03-21 11:27:05
How on earth could your bank close your account because you transferred money to an exchange? The heck?
@_date: 2018-03-21 13:26:07
Dang, that's a really cool product.
@_date: 2018-04-24 11:04:30
Wholeheartedly agree. Been reading it the past week. Excellent book.
@_date: 2018-04-25 00:41:57
