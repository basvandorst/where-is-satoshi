And they like to do things their own way

If we are being completely honest here I don't wanna see a pump like that because ill be buying on the 15th and I dont wanna buy during a pump
@_date: 2018-08-08 06:22:25
Volatility and transaction fees
@_date: 2018-05-21 01:59:58
They werent the spark that lit the fire

Cant argue there! God speed

Exactly. The people that are saying 25K\-50K by the end of the year are the same guys who were saying 100K\-1M just 2 or 3 months ago. A prediction doesnt mean shit if it changes with the market.
@_date: 2018-05-24 06:29:20
Anything under $1000��

Id like to take the risk for this but my 18th bday is on the 15th and i dont wanna buy after the market pumps if it does because thats how i lose a lot 
@_date: 2018-05-18 18:16:46
Where do you guys think the bottom is? 
@_date: 2018-05-20 18:44:48
If i was satoshi id be dead because i created a technology that could disrupt the way the governements of the world use currency to keep power.

If we see a 70% increase by 11:54 AM Central Time on May 15th 2018, Ill eat my dick on live television.

As an employee of walmart, i dont think they wanna see bitcoin succeed

Its too early for this.

Taking money out of the market digs a deeper hole. It may be the smartest move as an individual but for everyone as a whole its the worst thing that can be done
@_date: 2018-05-20 04:23:43
Exactly. Interesting vid though.
@_date: 2018-05-08 13:56:27
What is the "dickline" i keep reading about? Im kinda new to crypto
@_date: 2018-05-09 16:14:46
This decline is starting to scare me a bit. I enjoy trading the volatility.
@_date: 2018-05-11 22:30:25
@_date: 2018-05-08 21:37:36
Well I only eat my appendage in the event that we see a 70% drive. If that happens then apparently im fucktarded and i dont need to breed
@_date: 2018-05-11 22:48:51
I think if we ever get to zero it will because of shorting and huge pump and dump schemes
@_date: 2018-05-03 16:52:26
I was not defending banks. Im simply stating the cryptocurrency is wayyyy to volatile to store your life savings there. As the market matures and gets adopted the prices with stablize and thats when we actually pose a threat to banking and the USD.
@_date: 2018-05-08 18:58:59
Cant for personal reasons or I would
@_date: 2018-05-24 06:32:59
In a seriousness the lower it goes the better for the long haul. Lets say it drops under 5K. All the FOMO people from the 20K pump will go mental and buy like nothing weve ever seen��
@_date: 2018-05-03 17:04:42
Its currently an investment but stability will make it a currency
@_date: 2018-05-08 17:55:44
It will be on twitter
@_date: 2018-05-08 19:38:30
$15688.26 is the magic number and after watching it sword fight with 10K for a few days I just do not know
@_date: 2018-05-19 20:59:05
Definitely the hamburglar...
@_date: 2018-06-16 18:28:48
I like this idea...
@_date: 2019-02-10 06:39:09
Bitcoin died...someone give me a real reason to hodl��
@_date: 2018-04-27 14:14:05
I think of BTC as a safer store of value opposed to risky alts 
@_date: 2018-04-27 14:02:26
Can someone explain to me one thing? Is BTC an investment or a currency? Because in order for BTC to eventually take a major adoption by people it will first need to stablize. As of rightnow people are using it as an investment. Im think crypto has amazing potential but what is the goal if theres no stability?
@_date: 2018-04-29 21:11:44
Lets not make crypto a gender thing. If they adopt they adopt and if they dont they dont lets not make this a controversial wasteland.
@_date: 2018-04-25 14:29:20
This is insane!
@_date: 2018-04-27 14:10:08
Thanks for the clarifacation. Ive been looking into crypto for awhile now but i saw a video yesterday saying if its an investment its worthless
@_date: 2018-04-27 14:06:05
So crypto is only a temporary investment?
