L7L7L7L7 - great use case.  Bitcoin wallets + merchant services (particularly with the payment protocol) can really push the envelope on making the buying/payment experience truly seamless.
In the same direction, I  wonder if the following is possible with the payment protocol:
* A QR code is placed on a sign (or flyer, newspaper, etc.)
* Individuals can walk up to the sign,  scan the QR code, and make a payment.
* The person then automatically receives some type of digital good in their email inbox.
Maybe the sign is advertising a concert and the person receives an mp3 + a concert ticket in their inbox.

Thanks for sharing.  I thought I responded to this, but appears that I had not yet (my apologies).  When navigating to the link you shared, I get the following message:

Genxwire - great response.  It honestly seems like the Coinbase *structure* is even more problematic than the conflicts of interest that currently exist on Wall Street.  Any exchange can of course abuse their access to information.  However, most exchanges don't have separate divisions that would specifically benefit from such abuses.

Your points make sense, but I was more referencing the potential for the exchange owner (coinbase) to take malicious actions to benefit one specific trader on the exchange (coinbase).   Coinbase could:
* Watch specific traders on the exchange - monitor their trading habits, watch when they deposit large amounts of funds into their accounts and record how that impacts their trading behavior, etc.
* Adjust the matching engine to favor their own trades
* Potentially play with the transparency of the order book for their own trades
I am NOT saying that Coinbase is do any of these things.  However, there is nothing technically stopping them.

Yes, I agree with that as well.  I can't say that I have all of the same info. as Moe and the organizers regarding their situation with the conference and Josh.  However, from the outside looking in, based on the info. that is publicly out there, the recommendation to just drop him is the right one.

Prediction: Josh will not speak at the conference.  His scam will continue to fall into pieces in the coming days and by the day of the conference he will decide to voluntarily pull out given everything will be in shambles.  He will make the decision on his own to run and hide.
The above will be a direct result of the diligent research conducted about GAW by the many on these forums.

Just to be clear, your post confirms that the banks DO create money.  But,  there are just a number of factors that limit how much the banks can create.  These factors depend on the policies of the central banks. You rightly point out these policies involve things beyond reserve requirements.

JonnyLatte - you do describe correctly how fractional reserve works, which is exactly how the system worked many years ago when physical cash was the primary method of payment.  However, today it can and does work somewhat differently.
Scenario A:
The bank receives $1 of cash deposits.  The bank then chooses to lend out $0.90.  The recipients of those loans withdraw the $0.90 as cash and the bank still meets it's reserve requirement of 10%.
Scenario B:
However, if the bank thinks that some of the loan recipients will not withdraw the funds and deplete its cash reserves, the bank can lend (create) more money.  In fact, the bank could lend (create) up to $9.00 in new money and still meet its reserve requirement of 10%.  This would mean that none of the money created as part of the loans was withdrawn from the bank, which of course is unlikely.  However, it is also likely that at least some portion of the loan recipients new dollars will not be withdrawn as reserves.  Hence, a single bank does have the ability to create more than $0.90 all on its own.

mommathecat - see my previous post, you are describing how the system worked many years ago when cash was the most common means of payment.  What you describe is not correct today.

The question of the underlying drivers of the existing market structure is 100% spot on.  Nearly everyone neglects this (e.g. caracter_2).  This must be where the conversation starts.
If the Government created these monopolies, then the clear path is for the government to stop creating/promoting the monopolies.
Natural monopolies can in fact fall if/when substantial enough innovations arise.
Government regulated monopolies are historically much less likely to fall to innovation.  This means that a vote for net neutrality is a vote to ensure that Comcast remains in power for a much much longer time period.
 - have you seen any research on the first question of what led to the existing industry structure?

I've heard that Circle has been dealing with some fraud issues in part driven by their decision to offer instant buy, also in part related to offering credit cards as a purchase method.  So, in other words, Circle is not avoiding these problems and we may see them change their policy before long.

Sounds like they're just renting out a few desks, fairly typical for startups.  Sounds like a lot of FUD with little basis.
