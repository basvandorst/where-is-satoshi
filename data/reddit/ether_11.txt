not so sure about that.... but we don't know do we

5000 Nodes would cost about $50,000-$75,000 a month in VPS fees to run.
Not much for Olivier Janssens and Roger Ver to split for a month or two, considering they hold massive amounts of BTC.  Perhaps other corporate sponsors are also going to pay for them.

They're not open source. What do you expect.
No way to know if the wallet just steals everyone's coins on a certain date.
@_date: 2016-02-13 19:51:47
No they don't.   Here they don't allow personal ad hominem attacks and off-topic discussion.  Classic is an alt-coin, therefore its off topic.

The same argument applies to coin stakers in PoS though. New stakers would appear almost instantly.

I'm 50/50 ETH/BTC
Don't really care what happens as long as one of them wins.
@_date: 2016-02-14 20:23:23
You mean the first time you're 100% sure you're wrong?
@_date: 2016-02-08 05:22:21
For sure.

I'm sorry, but this tweet makes no sense.
Here's why:
- Software wallets where private keys are stored on the device are already exempt from the BitLicense, and don't require KYC/AML.
- The EU Bitocin KYC/AML Regulations only apply to exchanges where FIAT&lt;&gt;BTC exchange is happening.  Not BTC&lt;&gt;BTC wallet transactions.
If Samourai Wallet devs want to be so tough and edgy, let's see them operate an actual FIAT&lt;&gt;BTC Exchange without KYC/AML and see how long that lasts.
They're basically just trolling all of you with some lame marketing hype.  (For a closed-source wallet that could have massive bugs in it, or even steal your Bitcoin -- They aren't even public -- nobody knows whos behind the wallet.  )

As long as the spam attacks stop, then sure.  But Classic supporters are fraudlently paying shills, sock puppets, and bots to downvote and rigging the threads.
Until those attacks stop, this is the only way to have a conversation.

Page just shows:  
Draft is still in progress. Leaked versions are not accurate.

Thanks for the link.  28K BTC going to dump when a fork happens is quite significant for the price.
@_date: 2016-02-08 02:17:24
Bad PR
@_date: 2016-02-01 19:54:09
Don't download the file he linked.  Coin stealing malware is attached!
Mods please delete this ASAP!!!

An industry-wide forum that meets regularly to formally discuss proposals for upgrades would be a good start.
@_date: 2016-02-20 13:11:05
Same thing applies to hardware.... which hardware is real and which is compromised?
@_date: 2016-02-13 06:39:47
Irrelevant.  On other forums comments aren't scored at all. They're listed in chronological order.
@_date: 2016-02-03 21:54:41
It's impossible, open source is open source.   Private keys on a device  are impossible to regulate as long as free speech and github exists.
So,... nice try... good marketing tactics, but until you open source your code, you're not going to see anything but skepticism here.
@_date: 2016-02-12 03:04:27
Try posting that in @_date: 2016-02-20 06:41:58
The article reads like nonsense.
@_date: 2016-02-05 17:34:06
If it doesn't steal your money the day before...
@_date: 2016-02-12 22:53:04
It's reasonable to ban personal ad-hominem attacks  by sock puppets.
@_date: 2016-02-13 21:00:43
It's off topic. Not complicated.  Classic is an alt-coin.
@_date: 2016-02-03 21:50:51
Hey dooglus, good to see you here.
Just wanted to let you know that you're fucking awesome.  I used to bankroll and play on just-dice, and when you shut it down, the 60,000BTC were returned immediately to all account holders.
You're an honest motherfucker, and full of integrity.  Thank you!!
@_date: 2016-02-02 05:34:52
Sure it is... 
@_date: 2016-02-12 02:08:28
Wow... crazy... I guess he can buy some $10 ETH soon if he doesn't like Bitcoin anymore.
@_date: 2016-02-02 05:40:36
This is great good job.
@_date: 2016-02-13 03:46:47
Different topic.
@_date: 2016-02-08 02:16:47
Thanks bro. Backing up now.
@_date: 2016-02-20 06:16:36
You can also shut down the owners of mining pools/hardware
@_date: 2016-02-12 19:18:52
Censorship is required if you want to have a reasonable discussion online. Thats just the reality. 
Otherwise you will have sock puppets upvoting personal attacks and other vitriol.

I don't think either of those things are a concern in the real world.
