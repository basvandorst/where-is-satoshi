I enjoyed reading your contribution to this thread.

It looked like standing and facing the rear wasn't too bad. Might be able to decelerate before falling on your bum. Whiplash did look terrible on her head.

So what should Coinbase do? Allow you to sign something with keys from wallets you own to prove you still control those wallets? Don't know what else they could do.

Just a question for thought, what if it was sent to a paper wallet as a gift for someone, which lets say got lost in the mail?

I think the best sellers list could just be linking to your animal selection. I could be wrong though.
@_date: 2016-12-02 21:34:51
Yeah, but how would they know that?
@_date: 2016-12-03 09:52:16
It's not (as long as you can and want to prove that), but Coinbase can't prove it's your wallet. They just assume you met John Doe and said "Here's the bitcoin, where's my fiat? Good day, sir (or madam)." Of course a trade between fiat and bitcoin would be considered a sale, since just like stocks there could have been a profit or loss between the original purchase and the time you got rid of it.

Is it fun to be rich?

Is it bitcoin or the dollar that's fluctuating that much a day? 
@_date: 2016-12-03 10:34:46
True, but I'm wondering if the reason for all the concern is a fear from lack of documentation. You reasonably don't have this concern when paying with cash, but Bitcoin's blockchain keeps a record, whether or not you remember what you bought, traded, or gifted.

Interesting...I didn't know about wash sales. Seems as though for it to be considered one they have to sell at a loss before buying back. So if they make a profit it must not count.

About half of Americans don't have enough cash for a $2,000 emergency expense ( So it can depend on your definition of rich. If you have no debts, that's even better. My mortgage payment is cheaper than my apartment payment, but there are those other expenses related to home upkeep. So it kind of depends on your financial goals as to what kind of life you want too. As long as you're happy, that's cool bro.

I saw others state the IRS considers Bitcoin property and not currency. Is that not true?

That's how I might do it with company stock matches. It was a bonus to me, which was already counted as taxable income. Might as well not pay capital gains... But if I do make a profit at least investment platforms are able to track taxable income pretty well.

At this point, will you pay more in fees than it's worth?
@_date: 2016-10-27 17:19:17
Funny idea, but all the ones I know close not too long after work hours.
@_date: 2016-05-25 19:21:57
I guess that depends on how the difficulty level of the blocks fluctuates. Maybe you have something there though.

Someone has to maintain control. :-D
