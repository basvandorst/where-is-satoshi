It locks in your price at time of purchase.  Don’t worry about how long it takes to show up from pending status.

It’ll ask you when you select bitcoin wallet.

Ledger Nano S or Trezor seem to be liked around here.

I don’t think you can send bitcoin from coinbase to a segwit address.  I had to use legacy.  But yes segwit is preferred where available.

Will I get the forks on a ledger nano s?  Thinking about getting one.

I guess those citizens will have to Kuwait until Bitcoin is supported.

Apologies everyone I do large batch transfers and not small ones.  For smaller transfers yes these fees are currently blocking my ability to use bitcoin as my daily currency.
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:13:44
Not much, what’s happenin’ wit chu?
@_date: 2017-12-01 19:14:10
Strategy is to not panic sell.

If you move large amounts out of coinbase the ~$20 fee isn’t so bad.  If you need to move frequently use GDAX.  Also at this time you need to use a legacy ledger bitcoin wallet and not segwit for direct coinbase to ledger transfer from what I understand.

Do worry I just bought some we’re good.

They had huge demand from their recent sale and are behind a little bit.

Go to GDAX.com.  You can view there without an account.

Currently coinbase does not support segwit.  Some other exchanges do, by coinbase uses legacy.

So when big sell wall is it a good time to buy at the held down price?
