Yep the swings are pretty predictable 
And if you lose out ah well, onto the next Altcoin 
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:50:06
Get onto Coinspot
Even better for selling 
@_date: 2017-12-17 07:01:09
Yes only if you learn to have patience and not FOMO 
@_date: 2017-12-17 07:00:38
Plenty to justify it 
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:43:49
God I hope so
I want a big crash to shake normies off and go all in

Just wait till one has hit sideways movement with nothing on the horizon 
Watch the satoshi parameters it bounces between
Set buy and sell orders 
Walton chain has been predictable for me
Keeps bouncing between 44k sat and 48 k sat

Nothing is going to happen what the fuck is wrong with you people haha 
Bitcoin isn’t going to crash all of sudden because of futures 
For every short there’s a long position open 
Just because someone decides to short it doesn’t mean they control bitcoins price to crash??
Shorting it is extremely risky on the verge of mainstream adoption 
Every chad and Stacy and their grandma wants in on bitcoin now 
It’s the buzzword all over the world and people want in 
This is the correction/consolidation period right now 
Once people see how much of a non event it was, expect money to flow back in and on our way to a new ATH

Fuck everything about pay pal, their fees and support
Risky move though cause half the world don’t know about crypto and only know PayPal 
Request network may turn into PayPal 2.0 if they execute and become very user friendly for the public 
I would wait longer until a strong competitor shows up

Trading Altcoins is easy as fuck 
@_date: 2017-12-17 05:30:13
Must be from the hood

Not at all
I pay capital gains on whatever I cash out 
@_date: 2017-09-22 07:09:36
Funny thing crypto markets

Wasn't Bitcoin but I remember seeing a thread where one guy had 20,000 Neo and made a thread saying he sold it all as he was done 
He made a lot of money from buying at I co prices then the next week it went to $50
@_date: 2017-10-19 05:54:57
Haha I hate it so much
I've been there and there's absolutely nothing id like to wear in public
Completely for fuckbois only 
@_date: 2017-09-22 04:18:17
Hahaha the accuracy
@_date: 2017-10-19 05:53:48
