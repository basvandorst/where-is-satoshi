I wonder this too. If he is under investigation, then what if the police seized the money and has moved it?

You must be joking when you think it's your personal account. You gave money to the bank, they can do whatever they want with it. See [Fractional-reserve banking](

This was because there was "a lot" (40 out of 15.000~ transactions) of iDeal fraud going on at the time.
Better safe than sorry.

I like your post but the title is very misleading. You should add some flair to it that says personal opinion, because you have no valid source of any announcement happening soon.

You linked to a version made by someone else that says (Fixed Version)?  
It looks very fishy.

Hindsight is 20/20. Also I think "worst decision ever made" is a bit over the top, especially when you consider these are the very first releases of a piece of software.

Of course they heard about bitcoin it has been featured on the news and in newspapers, but they don't actually know anything else about it.
It's like hearing on the news that Sony is making a new console, but they don't know any of the specs.

I hope everyone understands that Leah McGrath Goodman has been working very hard trying to find Satoshi Nakamoto, and she probably had a deadline with the new Newsweek launch and all. It was probably rushed and she overlooked some points and nobody at Newsweek doublechecked it. Humans make mistakes, and someone at Newsweek should have doublechecked her story.
But to be completely honest though, she should have understood that even if it is the real Satoshi Nakamoto, she completely disregards that he just wants to be ignored. He does not want to be the face behind Bitcoin, he wants it to be a public thing. It's a really mean move to reveal someone who does not want to be associated with Bitcoin. I mean even Dorian Nakamoto called the cops because he wanted to be left alone and she still posts the article. Does she have no respect for privacy?

There is most likely someone working on the problem. But the person who makes statements is sleeping? Or the person who makes statements tries to get the problem fixed as soon as possible before making a statement. It would be nice if Kraken could tell they are aware of the issue.

Why are you posting under a Satoshi name?
* 1. Satoshi has been silent all this time why would he post this.
* 2. Do you really think he would care for 0,3 BTC when that is only a fraction of what he owns.
* 3. Why are you posting an address? This could start a witch hunt / doxxing and there is no evidence that this letter came from that address, it could be faked.

It's not that the title is wrong, it's that they **deliberately** changed the title to make it **less accurate**, which is exactly what clickbaiting is. There is no other valid reason to change the accuracy of this title other than clickbaiting.

You mean apart from the fact that they cut the sentence in half? Maybe you should look up the definition of "in that" because Bill Gates said "Bitcoin is better than currency in that you don't have to be physically in the same place."
So does Bill Gates think Bitcoin is better than [standard] currency? He thinks it's better for large transactions and for transactions that don't take place in the same physical space. This doesn't mean he thinks Bitcoin is the best currency, which is what the title tries to imply. Bill Gates understands certain strengths of Bitcoin and thinks they are better. Keep in mind Bitcoin still comes with a lot of risks because it's still in it's infancy and is extremely volatile compared to other currencies.
@_date: 2017-03-09 19:42:26
Let's take this sentence:
1.Fiat is better than Bitcoin in that it is much less volatile in it's current state.
A clickbait title would be:
"Fiat is better than Bitcoin -piratemax"
A more appropriate title would be:
"Fiat is less volatile than Bitcoin in it's current state -piratemax" 
Can't you see he mentions one reason he thinks Bitcoin is better? Do you not understand that both sides can be defended by reasons? Do you really think the only thing Bill Gates thinks about Bitcoin is that it's better and that's it? No risks, nothing?

Well isn't the entire point of Bitcoin that anyone can use it, regardless of your background.

I don't think it being on Reddit is a valid reason. It's not important enough to get an own sticky but maybe it can be put it in the sticky Bitcoin FAQ under Bitcoin Projects.

Have you ever read the stuff Linus Torvalds writes? Linus is very good at bad mouthing though with good reason, but sometimes to protect a project on the internet you have to be very explicit when you can't say it face to face.

Why are you e-mailing through support? You can contact Gabe Newell (the big man at Valve) directly at gaben he actually answers a lot of e-mails each day and if not he forwards them.
Another person to contact is Yanis Varoufakis, an economic (I think) working at Valve. There is a contact form on [his website]( and you can also read his blog at Valve about digital and European economics [here](
I'm not sure how bitcoins would work on Steam because you have a Steam Wallet. I recently sold a virtual item on the Steam Marketplace for 160 euros (before Valve takes a cut), but if the person who bought it uses dollars the marketplace would take his dollars and give me euros. Bitcoin prices vary a lot each day so I'm not sure how this would work out. The wallet also has a cap of $200 in value it can hold (because it's in beta) so this amount would get broken fairly fast if you have bitcoins equal to $200 in it right now.

Being dutch myself, what I did was tell them I don't have the money on me, it is invested (as a long-term investment). The average person only sees bitcoin as an investment, so you can use it that way. I am in my mid-twenties as well and I notice a lot of people around me make bad choises like paying 60 euros a month for their mobile phone or buying Beats headphones. Or even owning a car when they live 15 minutes from work on the bicycle.

Please refrain from spamming, it's better to have a good e-mail that talks about users of this subreddit wanting Bitcoins on Steam than a ton of e-mails with the same question. It's much nicer to ask about their opinion on Bitcoins than cry for adding Bitcoins to Steam.
