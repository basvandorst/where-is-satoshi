Here some additional photo during the building process.
Fun fact, but here in Thailand, finding an artist willing to tear banknote apart, was one of the most difficult part. You should have seen such pain in his eyes.
From the back of the painting, here a translation of the message my friend wrote : (English is not my nattive language, sorry for the mistakes)
This painting as a proof of love for a man that made me ask a question that changed my life and that everybody should ask themselves :
"How money works ?"
I've learned that the money should meet 3 criteria :
\- Be a medium of exchange
\- Be an account unit
\- Be a store of value
It's on the last point that since the Bretton Woods conference our fiduciary currency (Fiat money) collapses.
(From the latin) Fiducia, means TRUST, implying the fact that it rely on the trust that people are willing to give to the organization whom print it.
Today the knowledge - The evil's enemy - is more and more reachable and this Trust is slowly dissolving - Quite rightly - relying only on the stubborn lack of economic knowledge from the muzzled people.
I've learned that Money - This amazing and evil tool - became such an important thing in our existence - Tool of our passive slavery - that we shouldn't let it in the hand of the human kind... this failure among animal.
We are in the October 31, when at the same date back in 2008 a revolutionary white paper was published.
With hindsight, if you would've asked me to build a perfect currency, I would've have created the BITCOIN.
The Bitcoin has the power to give back to our fiat money the value that they truly represent : a damn dirty piece of paper !!!
And what is the most valuable thing to do for a piece of paper ? 
It's to be transformed into a piece of ART
