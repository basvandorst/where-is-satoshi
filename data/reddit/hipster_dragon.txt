There is no guarantee that bitcoin will ever be this high again. It’s all speculation. It could crash to $10,000 and never go beyond that for the rest of its life cycle. 
Really it just comes down to what you want. It could go up. It could go down. It could crash. 
The thing you have to remember is, there are a bunch of people who will get spooked. And the lower it goes, the more spooked people will be. 
I have not seen bitcoin crash this hard since 2013. This is way outside of the normal fluctuations.

Personally I would suggest selling all bitcoin you have. Only keep what value you are personally willing to lose. Bitcoin is highly volatile. 
So say, you have $2000 in bitcoin, but you’re only willing to  lose $500. I’d sell $1500 of your bitcoin. 
You really should only have, at most 5-10% of your assets invested in bitcoin.  Personally, I’d recommend 5%.
Shift your focus from getting rich quick, to making sound investments for your future. 
There are much more sustainable investment opportunities that do not have the volatility of bitcoin.  
I hope that helps.

Just throwing this out there, there is no guarantee that bitcoin will ever rise above its current levels. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 12:35:38
Why wouldn’t it be taken over by another crypto currency? There is nothing inherently special about bitcoin other than popularity. 
Look at how popular AOL was 20 years ago. Now look at it.

 Will say that this dip is way out of the typical statistical deviation of Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:11:03
You can make another coin with the exact properties of bitcoin easily. And it’s already been done.

This subreddit is way too optimistic. That’s all I’m saying. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:06:27
I couldn’t have said it better. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 12:41:15
Thank you.

What has really changed in the last week to make bitcoin double in price? 
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:07:27
Anything that doubles in price in a week is a high risk investment. I feel bad for the people who bet their life savings. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:15:24
You shouldn’t confident that either will occur. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 12:39:52
Yes it of course is useful since you can pay for stuff, but why would you spend a dollar if it would be worth two dollars the next week? That’s the point I’m trying to get across. It’s lost its value as a payment tool, and seems to be more about an investment. 
90% of the posts I see in this subreddit is investment advice.

I should have been a bit more clear. I meant that it has no inherent value because you could easily create a new crypto currency. E.G. ETH and LC. 
Gold has its value for its beauty, use in electronics, and being a fundamental element that cannot be reproduced in a Lab, it is the only material known to man with its exact properties. 
Bitcoin on the other hand can be copied easily by a good programmer. And it already has. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 20:11:20
Would have made a lot more with ETH or LTC. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 12:43:54
I’m not bagging on it’s potential. It’s great, but it really is not special. Any other crypto could take its place. Just like no one uses MySpace anymore, the same could be said about BC in two years. 
My only point was, don’t be so sure about the future of Bitcoin. Thanks for your post!
@_date: 2017-12-10 12:44:11
Derived from?
@_date: 2017-12-16 07:23:22
Gold has intrinsic value because it’s useful, beautiful, and in limited quantities. It cannot be duplicated. 
Bitcoin is a simple algorithm. It can be replaced by a new coin, Bitcoin+. Look at litecoin. Look at ETH. There is nothing special about bitcoin. The only reason the price is as high as it is is because a bunch of people jumped on GDAX and Coinbase and dumped their life savings in Bitcoin to get rich quick. 
My point is, this will not Last. If you look at the last week, all growth has stopped for bitcoin. It’s outside the standard deviation. This is not good.

No everyone is selling. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 21:32:53
Yeah it’s not garunteed, but I’m sure there are a bunch of people who will dump their coins at 10K and peace out. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 05:17:32
You are smart only putting in 5-10%. Bitcoin is highly volatile. It could crash tomorrow. Or next month. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 16:55:27
No investor will invest 80% of disposable income into something as volatile as Bitcoin. You never put all your eggs in one basket. 
There is no guarantee that any one investment will continue to rise in value indefinitely. That is why you diversify your portfolio with multiple investments of varying volatility. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 04:22:35
Would you recommend just buying some and holding onto it for a few years?
@_date: 2017-11-20 12:40:34
You have no idea whether it will crash to half it’s value tomorrow. You can’t. There is no way for anyone to know. The fact is, but coin is highly volatile. It could hit 10k in a month, and 3 months later, settle down at $300. You have no way of knowing. 
Yes, the historical trend is up, but there is no way you can know for certain that it will continue going up. That’s why I’m saying, don’t put all of your money in this basket. Do 5-10%. 
No investor in their right mind would tell you to dump all your money into a highly volatile asset, such as bitcoin.

It’s worthless. You can make crypto currencies with a couple guys who know how to program. Eventually people will figure that out and bitcoin will be worth pennies.
