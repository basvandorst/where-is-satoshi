Yes these things happen, and yes they move the price, but their effect is weak at best. The real swings happen when someone or a group of someones swing their money around while also using the methods you're suggesting at the same time. But you can't have one without the other. You need someone with deeep pockets to make the real swings happen.

I've been watching the charts for years. There are situations that directly require people to buy/sell (like mtgox) which is a bit different. But straight up fear mongering or posturing from even high profile individuals produces nothing but a blip on the radar. Even good news about technological advances (like the lightning network working) takes weeks or even months to fully manifest itself as a positive growth as a result. The up or down spikes we see are always triggered by individuals. Long lasting downtrends can be maintained by these individuals by being careful about when and how much they move their weight around, and then everyone starts following suit when they see a trend emerging which amplifies these individual's power.

Somebody made a mistake, I hope whoever did it comes out and tells us. The curiosity kills.

Or someone is trying to cover their tracks.

Would coinpayments.net work for you? 
Edit: ... What's with the down vote? Had it fallen from grace recently?

Ok, now I don't know what we're talking about.

This looks like you're trying to correct your comment by striking out m and replacing it with a number.

Count on... Perhaps not because to do so means we need a set timeframe. Will it happen eventually though? Probably imo, but who knows when.

Yes but why is it down? Because spamming the network will just push L2 adoption and therefore it's no longer profitable to spam the network.

Not sure if meant what you said.

Actually, a significant price decrease from here would complete a head-and-shoulders and we're likely to be heading down for the next few months.
