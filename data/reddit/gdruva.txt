Is it problem when people hold the gold? So now they can also hold the Bitcoin. However we know that the value is not always going up. And some people prefer to cash out at the times it falls. Some other holders will need some cash at random times to pay for hospital, education or anything else that comes on their way even if they would prefer to hold.

except the moment after buying in
@_date: 2018-09-06 13:52:25
I meant that, perhaps they are willing to buy in, and therefore some crash was needed first. That would let them acquire more BTC for paying less.

Very good point!

Maybe they bought already and then sold for higher price... took some profit. Now, perhaps they wanted to repeat the cycle and buy low again, so they had to release some bad news. They have experience and influence to manipulate prices and sentiment as they like.

Simply dont marging trade with high leverage... if one really wants, then use leverage with caution. 
Also dont use stop loss price targets that are visible to the exchange. Scammy exchanges can hunt for their customer's stop loss price levels to liquidate their positions and cash in profit.

Seems like he has valid arguments regarding the bubbles of housing markets and stocks, inflation etc. Peter Schiff is bearish towards all assets except precious metals. His arguments against Bitcoin may be valid or wrong, no ideal. Because in my opinion, these are builders, traders and holders who decide the future of Bitcoin, not the people from sidelines who just watch or talk about it. 
His predictions have been correct and incorrect in the past, meaning that few of his bearish predictions have materialized regarding various markets. However, even a broken clock is right twice a day

10-100x leverage can be ok, for example if a trader is risking only 1% of total portfolio value. But too often we see people who put in margin trade 50-100% of their portfolio and are unhappy that they get rekt because the asset price had a whip on the wrong direction.
Money/risk management skill is the most important tool that protects traders from losing their portfolio.

Another scam that an exchange can do is frontrunning your trades. Lets say you buy 10BTC for USD 10k - the estimated average market price but somebody or a bot from an exchange sees your order and quickly buys 10BTC before your order gets executed. After that the bot places a sell order for the price that is on average higher than you thought you would be paying -lets say 11k. Your buy order gets executed and you get 10BTC. You thought you would be paying 10k but ended up paying 11k because the frontrunning bot caused you a massive slippage. This example is an audacious scam... however if executed with caution, they can be hard or impossible to detect without statistical analysis. All can happen in fraction of a second. 
@_date: 2018-05-07 16:30:10
just a speculation... It could be also 0. Perhaps some extremely lucky penny stock could have been more profitable than BTC in a random year.

He's talking about inverse correlation which indeed means that there is no correlation. In short term we can see correlations and inverse correlations, however to my knowledge in long term there is nor correlaton nor inverse correlations.

The first participants of the network got bitcoin for free by mining. At first people did not question the price, because they were buying in with small amounts of cash and large amounts of BTC...  for example, would you care mutch about BTC price if you only buy it for 5$ ? Also look at Doge coin or Crypto Kitties token - people buy these for fun/entertainment, just because they can.
@_date: 2019-02-01 13:08:04

Since Bitpay is a service, they also want a % from your transaction and they have to enforce you all kind of limitations just to get that %. Merchants perhaps have to switch away from Bitpay to some more decent payment processors. However i believe that 1% fee to the payment processor is too much if you purchase something over 50$

I think you're right! Also, the cashed out fiat will go back to early BTC traders/investors eventually, which is a good thing, because now they can buy back some BTC if they want to get back.

Im waiting for a black swan in stock markets that would make some of stock traders to rebalance some of their money to the cryptocurrencies. Even 1% that could potentially move from 30 trillion U.S. stock market cap, could boost total crypto market cap by 300 billions USD.

Of course price is not linked with mining costs. However mining costs are linked with individual miner income and author is missing that point. Reminder: Mining income equals BTC price multiplied by BTC quantity that is mined and sold.

@_date: 2018-03-09 11:00:42
This time reversal could be faster because the cashed out fiat will be compensated to MtGox victims and a percentage of them will invest it back in BTC, in my opinion

Yes i aknowledge diminishing returns due to changing difficulty. Surely the total economy is more complex than it would be in mud pie example. 
However it all depends whether you look from perspective of macroeconomics or microeconomics. My former commet is from perspective of mircoeconomics where individual miner has clearly visible connection between costs and income. 
While if we would look from perspective of macroeconomics, we would see that adding extra hashpower would not generate extra bitcoins per month in total for all the miners in the world due to difficulty adjusting algorithm, bringing us to conclusion that increasing costs would not produce more income for all the miners together.
However its not clear wherther author is talking about all miners or about individual miner, but his argument that BTC price is not linked with mining costs surely is not helping him with his main point.
@_date: 2018-03-23 22:09:33
I thought a lot about it and i still dont understand their thinking patterns... maybe some people are not able or willing to understand where their profit came from, what would happen next and that the scammer had full control of their bitcoins.
@_date: 2019-01-31 12:13:12
The author of article tries to convince that miner income is not related with mining costs. However i disagree with author and agree with Vries about this.
Author's argument is that Bitcoin price is not related with mining costs. The author is right about price, yet wrong about income. Mainly because miner income is BTC price multiplied by quantity of BTC they mine and sell.
So in relation to authors example, i can tell that even if someone is setting up expensive mud factory and makes costly mud cakes, and if there is always someone who buys these mud cakes for extremely low price, the factory will have greater income than me, because the factory can produce and sell much more mud cakes than i could. 2 factories would produce and sell 2x the number of mudcakes and would have 2x income comparing to 1 factory. 2 factories would also have twice as much costs as 1 factory, and if they bring losses then 2 factories would also double the losses relative to 1 factory. 
Same economy is with BTC miners, more miners means more electricity, hardware and labor costs that result in more mining power that generates more BTC per month increasing the monthly income that miner can receive. Whether the miner is profitable, thats another question.  
After knowing this simple math and income calculation, how can one argue that miner income is not related with mining costs?
@_date: 2018-03-14 05:12:18
No wonder that the banks are interested in blockchain... The trust based spaghetti processes and eternal audits and checks make banks slow and costly to run. It also starts to make sense for them to have a private, permissioned blockchain internally that keeps the accounting in check at all times and interacts with public blockchain that has some privacy features to reliably reveal just enough transaction information to regulators and other parties.

HODL is also self fulfilling prophecy. The more people hodl their crypto, the less supply there is. Lower supply tends to drive the prices up. The recent crash was due to the sudden increase in supply, nothing to do with technology.

I expect that some % of the cashed out $ will come back in Bitcoin as soon as MtGox victims will get compensated.
@_date: 2018-02-18 06:41:48
Some people are simply not traders. They risk big and think that volatility will not go against them. Some people are bad traders because they can't get the market timing right. Some just simply have day jobs and cant constantly be devoted to trading. So in thise cases Hodl is the winning strategy.

After reading the book "Antifragile" and "Fooled by randomness", I can imagine Bitcoin more as the antifragile system that gains from FUD and black swans in other markets.  Investors need to diversify, so they sometimes could choose Bitcoin. People who suffer from hyper inflation in their own country also tend to choose crypto where inflation is predictable even though the price is much more volatile.

Although i firmly believe that BTC should be compensated instead of fiat, I would not worry too much about bitcoin price... When the cashed out USD during compensation will reach all the early traders/investors, then they all can easily pump the price back to 20 000$ and reverse the recent damage.

Could it be that some whale size trader dumped BTC with market sell limit of 8000$? price could go fast down to this point because the liquidity and market depth was not sufficient at that moment.
