Went about the same thing just that i had my wallet on blockchain.
It charged me about $58 to sort of "convert" my old wallet and now the balance shows 5k+ in my wallet.
To be honest, I had no idea what i just did.
True story.

Man, that fee is ridiculous.
Btw, how do i determine the size of my transaction? Is it the more btc you send the size will be larger?

At least i am.
 i bought it when it was still 40 USD a pop. However i cringe a little to know that, fck that's how much lesser i'm making with each drop and it is a lot. That's one free house for the niece gone, that's one boat for grandma gone.

You said it yourself, the US classified Bitcoin as "digital asset". Are the stuffs on sale on Craiglist, "digital asset"? in the US?
@_date: 2018-02-28 01:39:07
I think that's China

I don't care if you're real or just an imposter. I just want to tell everyone that i still blame mtgox for losing my 43 BTC.
