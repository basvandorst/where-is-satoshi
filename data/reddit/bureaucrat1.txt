You're right. It's silly to measure in btc prices, imo. If he's making money, but just not as much if he held all btc, his crypto investments were good but not as amazing as they could have been.

Good point about infinite fork and expectations of updating their code.

Not really if you understand how markets work. EBay used to own paypal, then they split off. So every 1 share you held of eBay, you now held 1 share of eBay and 1 share of paypal. You didn't get something for nothing, because at the end of the day your shares of 1 eBay + 1 paypal = 1 pre-split eBay share + (very slight growth from market liking the split). Same thing happened here as far as I can tell. Crypto Market is a little less efficient than the stock market, so there may be a bigger error in "true value".

Electrum doesn't directly support bcc. I think the general plan is to create a new electrum wallet with new seed after the fork, transfer all the coins from old electrum wallet to new wallet. Then export old electrum wallet keys to software that supports bcc.

I bought like $10k worth when btc was $10. Watched it climb to like $30ish. Sold it all at like $2-3 or so after the mtgox crash. Yeah we're not all btc millionaires. People not around during that point don't really realize how hard it was to hold after the mtgox crash. When basically the only place on the internet that allowed you to convert btc to usd shuts down and is hacked out of most of its value, it's pretty hard to believe it's a viable investment. I don't regret it at all though. Not a chance in hell I'd have held 1k coins when it was valued at even $100/coin. I was just starting to sell when it was $30/coin and had probably sold like 5% already.

He's not very tech savvy. He doesn't, or at least didn't in 2012, have a computer in his office. He has stayed away from the tech sector for a very long time, until recently, and people believe it was others that invested in IBM and apple and not Buffett. He also has quotes like "Technology is just something we don’t understand, so we don’t invest in it." and "I know about as much about semiconductors or integrated circuits as I do of the mating habits of the chrzaszcz." Whether that's truthful or not is certainly up for debate, but he certainly portrays the image of not understanding tech.

Assuming nobody is entering or leaving the market, that is exactly what will happen. Reality is there are people on the sideline waiting to buy btc after the fork. Also people probably losing faith in bitcoin because of the drama. Hard to know if those will cancel eachother out to a similar effect like a stock split.
@_date: 2017-08-04 01:50:36
According to their announcement "Customers with balances of bitcoin at the time of the fork now have an equal quantity of bitcoin cash stored by Coinbase." So I believe yes.

Right. It should be pretty obvious they weren't, considering customers withdrew massive amounts or coins. It was basically a bankrun on coins, and they had no problem filling requests. I'm more confident than ever that they're on the up and up.

That's the mainstream consensus and why people seem to like 2% inflation. My thought is that inflation grows the GDP, but encourages wasteful spending. In a deflationary currency, I'm still going to buy food, shelter, buy new phones, see movies, etc. However, I'll be more careful blowing money on useless shit. This is better for the overall world, IMO. Yeah, our GDP goes down, but I assume environment is way better when we don't buy a whole bunch of garbage, we are less encouraged to invest in useless businesses, etc. If you can get a real 2% in the bank, and a real 8% in the market, you'd probably still invest in the market. If you get a real -1% in savings, and a real 6% in the market, you invest. The big difference is when you're middle class, and keep a majority of your assets in savings, you're just getting fucked. When you're wealthy, you only need to keep like 1% or less in savings, so you get comparatively less fucked. 
Other problem is inflation typically is just a hidden tax on people that aren't in cahoots with the source of inflation. Banks just get massive windfalls from inflationary policies, as they're the first ones receiving newly minted money. If you think inflation is good, would you also think it's good if the government had 0% inflation, but random mafia members were just counterfeiting and increasing the money supply by 2%/yr? That should encourage people to spend more quickly. Except the real beneficiaries are the counterfeiters and the people first in line to receive the counterfeit money.

There could have been a way to avoid it, but it's still a pure scam. Imagine you own ebay stock on fidelity back when it was one company. ebay is going to split into ebay and paypal. Fidelity says, you can cash out or move brokerages, but we will just keep the paypal stock post-split if you leave it on the brokerage. Yeah there was warning, but they're essentially stealing equity. You can't expect all your customers to just keep up on the news. 
@_date: 2017-08-01 15:23:44
If you had 5 BTC, you now have 5 BTC and 5 BCC. You can hold both. You can choose to sell 5 BCC and buy a little more BTC for it or vice versa. If you have the private keys, no rush to decide what to do really.
@_date: 2017-08-04 01:54:51
I think a similar situation is if fidelity said our company won't support paypal shares. Then when eBay split to 1 share of eBay and 1 share of paypal, they could just say oh we said we wouldn't  support paypal shares, so you're sol. That obviously wouldn't fly. It's slightly different because of forcing coinbase to do more coding to support bch, than it would take to support paypal shares, but I think it's a similar idea.

That's a good point. It was pretty slow with many requests simultaneously and we did some workarounds with memory cacheing. I assumed most high traffic sites did that sort of thing, regardless of the database they used. Do other high-traffic sites that use other databases typically read directly from the database? I forget exactly how backups worked. I know restoring from a backup was a disaster, but I think making backups of the db wasn't much of a problem.

First thing that got me interested in bitcoin was a bitcoin faucet way back in the day. It was about $0.03 of btc way back in the day. I forget how much btc I got, but I think it was around .01 btc. I invested about $10k into it a month later once I was confident I knew how to use the bitcoin client. I think the people giving away btc early on probably ended up much better off in the long run, due to people like me that threw lots of money in and helped spread the word once they knew how it worked. If you're wondering, I didn't hold the entire time =/. I bought and sold at various points, and came out a little ahead. Back in the day, it was hard for me to just throw money at it without first making some "practice" transactions to gain confidence that I wouldn't accidentally lose it all.

It's not foolproof, but I'd rather trust some random ethereum people than the hackers I paid ransom to. If hackers are honest, you win either way. If hackers are dishonest, you have some chance that the eth guys refund your money.

Prob 8%/yr. But without the potential for complete disaster, imo. If you own a million in btc, it would be really smart to diversify out to stocks as well.
@_date: 2017-08-01 15:33:25
No specific reason this event should do anything but cause it to go down in the short term, IMO.
In theory, if the market cap of BTC was 10B, BCC and BTC should now have a combined market cap of 10B. Then the equilibrium happens to find the relative value of each. So then maybe BCC market cap will be 1/10th of BTC, so then BTC would be 9B and BCC would be 1B, hence resulting in BTC losing 10% of its market cap. A side note is that the holders of BTC prior to the fork haven't lost any value, because they still hold BCC as well. They can just sell their BCC and buy ~10% more BTCs.
This doesn't account for any new investors though. This split could possible spur some people on the sidelines to buy up a bunch of BTC or BCC, as people may view the news as good for BTC long-term stability/growth, or may be interested in buying up the new BCC. That part is incredibly tough to predict what kind of demand the new and updated coins will have.

Most large gold transactions are probably actually on paper.
@_date: 2017-08-14 23:40:01
Depends. If your some noob with 1k or less, you may be best off just hoping  coinbase knows what it's doing. If you keep it in your own paper  wallet backed up, you wont experience 3rd party risk, but that also comes with risk of messing stuff up, losing private keys, hacks, etc. Hardware wallet is supposedly even safer, but impractical for 1k or less balances. It's an it depends thing. No method is risk free, and each method experiences different kinds of risks.
@_date: 2017-08-15 08:50:13
Exactly. OPs advice is not good for the average btc user with a smallish balance of like 1k or less. They're probably safer just keeping it on coinbase.
@_date: 2017-08-01 16:23:58
The holders of the new coins, the ones selling the BCC for Btc, and the sellers of btc for bcc are part of establishing the equilibrium and shouldn't effect overall combined market cap of the two coins. The ones selling either of the 2 for alts will effect market cap for sure, as it always does. That's covered in my last paragraph of predicting overall demand for both coins.
Whole point was that if overall combined demand for btc and bcc is the same as btc was, btc price should go down but no loss in personal value for holders. This is the base scenario that should happen. But it's hard to predict if this split will increase or decrease demand for combined btc/bcc demand. It could go either way. Maybe people trust each coin in aggregate less than before, or maybe it will spur new investments.

I doubt WB is for it or will ever be for it. He's very pro-american business and not super big on other countries. Further, he's very anti gold. He loves investments that earn a stable profit and pay back profits to investors. He also likes companies with a moat. Btc is none of those things.

I'd sit tight at least for a little bit. It's not clear to me if the fork has happened yet. I think it doesn't officially happen until a block has been mined, but I'm not 100%. Personally I'm going to wait 1 day until the dust has settled a bit. If the market is roughly efficient, it shouldn't matter much exactly when you dump bcc, if that's your plan.

No. There's enough volume in btc that 500k prob won't effect the price much though. To sell, there needs to be a buyer. So if satoshi was trying to unload his original stash, theres not a few billion in buy orders lined up at current market price.

Before there was an exchange and btc was basically worthless, some dude paid 10000 bitcoins for 2 pizzas to some other guy.

If this is a life changing amount of money to you, you should honestly cash out a majority of them. If instead of finding 40k in btc, if you had found 40k in cash in your backyard, would you invest that 40k into bitcoin? If not, you probably shouldn't keep holding onto the bitcoin. Maybe cash out like 30-35k into cash, and keep the last 5-10k in btc as an investment. But I don't think it's prudent to just go allin with a lifechanging amount of money on bitcoin, when you previously knew hardly anything about it.
