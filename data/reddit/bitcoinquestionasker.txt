u/elementjj : Didn't show anything when I did it with m/44'/1'/0'
Is it supposed to take a while to sync first or something? Maybe I haven't been patient enough with either try. It seemed to have done syncing after maybe 20 seconds max.

Resolution: I went ahead and tried to recover my BIP39/44 master seed from Mycelium (iOS) in the blockchain.info wallet app on iOS, and it seems to have worked. I believe my issue was that I was on "Account  in Mycelium (iOS), which must have been the second account created in the HD wallet (first one is probably "Account  -- which it seems I created, didn't use, and deleted in the app). That's why it probably didn't show up in the Electrum app -- since it only loads the first account in your "HD wallet". Now I can see my past transactions and send my BTC from the Blockchain.info app.

I've used Blockchain.info before, so I'm ok with it, at least for this transaction. And I like how it handles choosing your fee. I just don't know what fee (sat/b) to choose.

Hi Dale, I really appreciate this video you put out. It’s helping me to understand a bit better the pieces in what I am trying to do. 
I’m trying to safely send Bitcoin from my Mycelium iOS app wallet (for which I have a 12-word seed) to my hardware wallet. Trouble is that the Mycelium app is acting wonky. I don’t know if I should trust it. So I’m looking to import that seed in another wallet and send the funds from there. 
This comment of mine on a thread I made today explains a bit more what I’m trying to do. Do you think you could help me please?

OK, but it's the only wallet that I was able to recover my funds in, using my 12-word seed from Mycelium iOS. I only plan to use it to send one transaction to my Ledger Nano S wallet. Thoughts?

I saw a post here: 
That recommends using the fee on this site:
I'm also trying to decipher this site:
Any idea how to pick a fee that will only take a few hours max? Doesn't have to be instant. I just don't want it to get stuck forever.

It says it's "Account  in Mycelium for iOS. 
Should it show as "Account  in the app by default? If so, some speculation: Maybe I created and deleted the first account in the wallet before really using it and don't remember it? And thus the other apps didn't load anything other than the first account ("Account  finding it empty? 
Would be a strange numbering scheme, though.

How do you know to trust the company? I understand it's not open source. Do they have a long track record?

I tried today -- loaded my seed keys from Mycelium (iOS) into Electrum, chose "BIP39 Seed", and nothing showed up. No past transactions, no BTC, different "receive" address than Mycelium (iOS) currently has. Everything is still showing as there in my Mycelium iOS app. I double-checked all of the seed words.
@_date: 2018-01-12 00:34:45
Didn’t work so well because my BTC is on the second account generated by the seed, so it didn’t find it. Do you know how to access the second account in a HD wallet, recovered using the master seed in Electrum?
@_date: 2018-01-28 22:26:27
Let’s say you have a bunch of “received” transactions in your Ledger wallet (each to a different address). Can you “send” to your next “receive” address to consolidate those inputs?
@_date: 2018-01-06 03:27:32
I just don't know if the BIP 39/44 settings are the same on Electrum wallets as the seed from Mycelium (iOS).
@_date: 2018-01-10 08:32:08
You might be right (Edit: Didn’t work), but I'm still not sure, as per our discussion here: 
I'm now trying to figure out how to validate my download of Electrum's PGP signature (for Mac version), when I've never done this and don't know how it works.
@_date: 2018-01-10 08:13:58
How do I do that exactly? Is it with the m’/44’/0’/0’ path? I never had a screen asking me for account number (Electrum for Mac).
@_date: 2018-01-10 08:17:23
Thank you, I will give it a try.
Edit: Didn't show anything with m/44’/1’/0’ -- no past transactions, no BTC.
@_date: 2018-01-12 00:37:15
I can't read the code, so I don't fully trust it.
@_date: 2018-01-10 08:34:25
Know any trusted guides that explain how to verify my download of Electrum with PGP? 
I've just started to watch this video: 
Edit: Yes, that video pretty much explained it. This post adds to it:
Edit 2: As in the thread linked above, attempting to change the Electrum wallet path to m/44'/1'/0' thinking that might be how it would access what Mycelium (iOS) shows as "Account  didn't seem to work.
