They aren't meaningless they are destructive threats. People like Peter Todd have been holding up the ETH/ETC situation of why hardforks are dangerous. But (I'm not sure Peter has said this) they also threaten to create exactly that sort of split if a super-majority of the miners try to institute a fork.

That's a much weaker non-specific way of saying the same thing.

"The transaction throughout increase is likely to be **no more than 86%** unless there are major shifts in the type of transaction Bitcoin is used for."

Do you really believe that there wasn't any serious support for Classic? And if so, what is your rationale for why the emergency Hong-Kong meeting took place and why miners were cajoled into signing a public document promising to only run core compatible clients?
The fact that the timelines discussed in that agreement have now expired (unless you start to use semantics and technicalities), and the fact that some of the core developers are again convening meetings with the miners, tells me that there is every reason to think/worry/hope that a "contentious" hard-fork could be on the horizon.

The logic of this is astounding. 
On the one hand you're criticising bitfinex/zane for not providing enough information and giving canned responses. 
On the other hand you're massively over interpreting the responses zane *has* given and drawing conclusions about how they will handle the situation.
Do you see *why* in situations like this businesses are often reluctant to make public statements? Because people like you will grab every word they say, twist it and contort it, and use it to start/spread rumours that are based on virtually nothing.

The rumours are just the latest round of Coinbase bashing from this sub as punishment for Brian Armstrong refusing to tow the party line on blocksize.
That said, the Australia expansion doesn't really say much. It's something that would have been in the works for many months if not years, while the current rumours suggest they lost funds in the last couple of weeks.

Bitcoin is a decentralised network, it is supposedly driven by its users. Bitcoin Core is just one implementation of the network protocol and any changes the Core developers make or don't make are supposed to be optional for the network to adopt or not.
Yet whenever the question comes up of who or how the protocol can change the goal posts shift all over the place like jumping beans. 
When Gavin, Mike, Jeff, some of the longest standing developers were pushing for a block size increase we heard that developers really don't call the shots. Bitcoin was designed so that hash power rules and the devs can't decide what the miners want to run.
But if it looks like the miners might fork certain Core devs tell everyone "miners don't matter, full nodes matter". Then they start talking about hardforking the hashing algorithm, which would ironically cause the sort of split we keep being warned about.
If lots of full nodes run a blocksize increasing implementation then - besides the DDoS attacks - the same Core devs try to discredit them. "Nodes don't count if they are running remotely". Then they will talk about how nodes don't get to decide bitcoin's future its economic consensus that matters.
Then when major Bitcoin companies like Coinbase, Bitpay, Bitstamp etc etc or "Bitcoin rich" individuals come out in support of bigger blocks, suddenly economic consensus isn't important anymore either, and we need to ask Punxsutawney Phil whether there will be 6 more weeks of winter.
So you tell me? Is the future of Bitcoin whatever Greg Maxwell says it is?

Well bitfinex is a relatively young and rapidly growing company, so the chance are very high that none of the shareholders has seen any profit in the past. But even if they had it's not "draining", it's just how a profitable business operates.

This is broken clock territory. It's piss easy to say "I told you gox was in trouble" after the fact. But if people stopped using every service that redditors start bashing and complaining about then two things would happen:
1. We'd have even more shitty "tails from customer service" posts clogging up the front page because the exchanges would be using that to attack each other. 
2. All Bitcoin companies would be bankrupt because none of us would use any of them.
I thought it was surprising and even a little amusing that some of the most well known Bitcoin developers managed to get burnt by gox. But I can't really blame them for ignoring or at least downweighting the noise and accusations that were coming from this community.

For day trading I have no suggestions because I don't do it. But there are various exchanges with lower fees than Coinbase and with leverage tools.
For getting paid I don't see any reason not to use Coinbase. If you are just exchanging small amounts of money with friends, tell them that. If you're working as a freelancer and receiving infrequent but sizeable payments, tell them that. If you're running some sort of retail business and receiving large numbers of payments...

We went through all this with mtgox. People wrote detailed proposals about how they could freeze withdrawals but keep allowing people to trade and - if they were insane - deposit funds. Eventually the trading fees would cover the losses and customers could withdraw again.
That's not a million miles from what you're describing, and both ideas are ridiculous because you basically just mean:
"let people trade non-existent bitcoins back and forth until the fees eat it all away. Oh and by the way your whole company has to work for free in the meantime because the chances are you weren't even particularly profitable before the hack, and certainly won't be afterwards."

You've never seen any posts complaining about kraken withdrawals? Never seen anyone saying there customer support are not responding or that they are being difficult about verification?
I've pretty sure I've seen those sorts of posts about every single exchange, and my other point was that you would see a lot more of those posts about every company if we started a bank run every time there were reports of withdrawal delays.
It's true that gox had a shit ton of those posts, and I am one of the people who stopped using them long before they went bust. But they were one of the earliest exchanges and they had a fucking massive proportion of the market back then. So you would absolutely expect them to have a large number of complaints and problems.

Some people are. In fact lots of people are, otherwise it won't ever get anywhere near to the 75% mining support needed.


That would be a vastly bigger change than altering the block size limit and would only serve to alienate any portion of the mining community that was still opposed to Classic.


With the hypothetical majority of miners, and exchanges, and businesses that accept bitcoins, all moving to trigger classic; if some group of people try a last ditch effort to fork their proof of work and rescue "their" Bitcoin, the best they could hope to achieve is making the fork go badly in exactly the way Peter Todd described in this article.

You're right that currently lots of Bitcoin commerce goes through third parties, and potentially even more third parties than in regular finance. But importantly it doesn't necessarily have to.

But you also suggested that Bitcoin is less good, rather than better, for those things because it's traceable. This is an argument people have been trying to make for years, and it's wrong.
Bitcoin transactions are public. Chains of transactions can be traced to a certain extent. Linking individuals to different parts of those chains and proving who paid whom for what is extremely difficult. 
The only way you can get close to that information is by having clear identification of people buying, selling or spending bitcoins at major businesses. Hence why Coinbase and others request a lot of KYC information.

I think you're arguing the wrong thing here. More users doesn't mean more miners. 
But bigger blocks doesn't hurt mining decentralisation either. One of the frequently used arguments against increased block sizes is that the big mining operations in China have shitty internet connections and would genuinely struggle with 8Mb blocks. But that's actually good for mining decentralisation. It reduces the cost advantage of running a giant data centre in some warehouse in the Chinese countryside as opposed to running a miner in your home office with your 100mb/s broadband. It's a good thing!

As a British person I can tell you with absolute certainty that GB has no plans to leave the Euro. Mostly because we don't use it in the first place.
The contagion aspect is precisely why this Greek situation has gone on so long. The ECB and IMF have spent years propping up Greece with emergency loans, partly in the hopes that the country will recover, and partly to slowly nudge Greece out of the line of dominos.
I'm not suggesting that there won't be some degree of international fallout from a Greek default. But it will be substantially less pronounced than it would have been two or three years ago.

Further reducing their public sector to a bare minimum would probably push unemployment up to 30-35%. There wouldn't be any support for this massive proportion of unemployed society because you've reduced taxes in an attempt to undercut Luxembourg and become the new European tax haven.
So one in three people unemployed with no source of money. Sure this might spur some renaissance of entrepreneurship. Tens of thousands of new small businesses operating locally peer to peer and competing to drive the best and brightest to the forefront... 
Or they might just do what poor and desperate people do all over the world and turn to crime. Yeah, probably the second one, especially since you've cut policing to a bare minimum.

Where do people get this idea that if you throw the phrase OTC into the mix the basic concept of supply and demand goes out the window?
Trades happening outside of public exchanges may be less visible, but they still draw on the same supply of coins for sale. If millionaires and investment bankers were really accumulating tons of bitcoins OTC, there wouldn't be any coins left for sale on the exchanges. The price would still go up, just with a slight lag period. 
Current demand for bitcoin averages to around $830,000 a day. If it were greater than that the price would be higher.

No. I haven't read any convincing arguments for why raising the block size would be bad. 
I've read claims that massive mining operations in rural China will not want to deal with larger blocks because of bandwidth issues. That seems like a good thing to me. Since when was anyone happy about the massive consolidation of mining power in China of all places?
I've read claims that we should leave the cap in place so that a fee-market will develop and small value transactions will be forced off the blockchain. That's great! Let's throw out everything we've been pitching to people for the last few years. 
No more tipping (unless using centralised offchain services). No more paying for coffee (unless you buy a $50 giftcard). No more pizza for bitcoin, and if you want Alpaca socks you'd better buy 100 pairs otherwise the transaction fee is going to bone you.

I'm not trolling here, I'm really not. I've been buying and using bitcoin since 2012. I just don't go in for the ostrich position.
You're ELI5 rationalisation involves two things:
1. Simplifying a fairly large network to a handful of people, so you can pretend that Satoshi and Alice still think bitcoin is worth $10 but they just don't want any right now.
2. Halfwit early adopters being forced to cash out at a loss because they invested everything they had in bitcoin.
So let's try another simple thought experiment. We can call it Occam's razor:
The bitcoin price has dropped substantially over the last two years: [note the recent increase is a drop in the ocean of the last two years](
It's dropped because supply has outstripped demand. 
The production of new bitcoins is fixed.
So either early adopters are so disenchanted with bitcoin that they have been cashing out and flooding the market. Or the rate of adoption has stalled because people generally aren't fans of catching falling knives.

MasterCard are wasting their time. Bitcoin is already struggling in the UK because our banks are making it so difficult to get GBP into bitcoin in the first place.
Three years ago I bought my first bitcoins on intersango after making a normal free UK-&gt;UK bank transfer. They immediately lost their UK bank account.
I subsequently used transferwise and currencyfair to get money onto Euro-denominated exchanges cheaply. They both stopped doing transfers to bitcoin exchanges due to pressure from banking partners.
Most recently I tried the obvious local bitcoins option but, despite verifying my ID with the site, every seller wants me to send them selfies while holding up my passport and bank card. Because clearly those are things you want to be giving to strangers over the internet.
With or without Mastercard's interference, bitcoin will struggle horribly in the UK until we get a bitcoin friendly bank.

The point I wanted to make by quoting your childish last line is that every time you resorted to such stupid insults you may as well have been talking to your bathroom mirror. 
So if you really want to make a convincing argument I'd have to suggest:


Things like LN may not even be necessary if major Bitcoin growth doesn't happen over the next few years, But after a sensible increase in the block size cap it will be clearer what second layer solutions are truly required (it could be that those things are not necessary for many years and blockstream's business model may be horribly flawed). Also, by the time transaction growth catches up with a steadily increasing blocksize there will have been plenty of time to properly test things like segregated witness and LN. I'll be more willing to hear you out if we reach capacity that causes an adoption-killing fee increase even after we have made the simpler modification to the protocol and scaled block sizes to reflect the ever increasing capacity of our hardware and networks. I suspect others will too. Right now those second layer solutions are not needed, and much more importantly **they aren't fucking ready!** You're arguing that it's safer and saner to scale Bitcoin using solutions that aren't even finished yet rather than just increasing what was always *always* intended to be a temporary cap.

Yes there are. People here in actively organised "stress tests" where they would shuffle around tiny amounts of bitcoin between their own addresses in a deliberate attempt to fill the blocks.
That is absolutely positively indisputably spam transactions.
Now that a week or so has gone by and the threads orchestrating the stress tests are far from the front page people are pointing to full blocks and saying "look we desperately need to raise the limit" when back in reality we have not reached that level of transaction volume yet.
I guarantee that if/when the block size is increased a bunch of people will be contacting naive journalists and trying to get them to write stories about how "bitcoin use is growing so fast the protocol had to be changes etc etc." that is what all this spam is meant to achieve.

Which group? The ambiguity around how "consensus" has been used isn't because people don't own dictionaries. It's because people who don't want to change the limit keep moving the goalposts all over the place. 
"My side" as you keep calling it proposed a 75% hash rate super majority to trigger a fork. "Your side" literally attacked any pool operator or node that was voting for the fork. 
I'm sure you know damn well that a substantial number of major Bitcoin businesses and lots and lots of users have publicly stated that they support increasing the blocksize. I'm also damn sure you know that the number of people and companies running XT specifically is suppressed because people don't want their internet connections crippled by idiot children who can't let others express opinions they disagree with.

No, your thought experiment didn't prove anything let alone in an irrefutable way. It relies on one or a small number of early adopters selling off huge swathes of their bitcoin holding to outweigh the exponential influx of new users. So, yes, you are making specific claims about the behaviour of early adopters. What's more the specific claims you are making are both less plausible and far more depressing than the far simpler explanation of stagnant growth.
I'm not saying that renewed growth may be happening over the last couple of months, and I would absolutely love to see a big media storm that actually does bring in millions of new users.

A hard fork requires a majority, not consensus. Yes, an uncoordinated hard fork would be messy, but Bitcoin still isn't that big an eco-system right now, coordination would be entirely possible. 
Consensus is a shitty poorly defined term thrown about by people who don't want to increase the blocksize. The concept of "consensus" will absolutely go straight out the window the moment blockstream discover they need a hard-fork to add some functionality that directly enables their side projects.
Why do I think people want a lightning network? To provide additional scaling on top of what is easily and simply possible by steadily increasing the on-chain transaction capacity. Scaling up Bitcoin itself does not prevent LN from being useful. On the other hand crippling Bitcoin does create added incentives for the developers of LN. 
Try to cool off for a second and show me where you see a conflict of interest? Do you really think "my side" is trying to destroy Bitcoin with the world's most convoluted 20 year "scaling attack"? Or do you think maybe, just maybe, people developing second layer transaction stuff have something to gain from keeping Bitcoin transactions handicapped?

It was a mean thing to say, but I'm just trying to emphasise what a niche case you're describing. I'm genuinely having trouble working out what exact set of circumstances would need to happen for the refund lag to be a problem when using a credit card.
You'd need to max out your credit limit early in your billing cycle and then your card would become useless for two days while you wait for the refund to be applied right? 
Note than even then it's not that you can't access your money. You haven't spent any money yet, it's just credit. You're temporarily losing access to a line of credit. Bitcoin doesn't help with that.

Some people, lots and lots of people, don't actually want to be responsible for the security of most of their wealth. Depositing in banks, investing in bonds or stocks, it all defers some level of responsibility to a regulated third party.

Many but not all though right? If it were a simple one sided issue the cap wouldn't be there at all. But clearly increasing or removing the block size cap will increase the rate of growth for the block chain massively and soon enough it will be too large for ordinary individuals to store. 
It seems like there will always be a cap even if it is higher than the current one. Therefore there will always be a limit on the number of transactions being confirmed. Therefore zero fee transactions are always going to become unworkable at some point in the future.

Madoff is serving 150 years, and at least some of the guilty parties from Enron were convicted. The last I heard no-one even knows TradeFortress's real name. The cases you cite are actually perfect examples of the regulations being enforced.

For the other exchanges, Bitstamp *et al*, some people have to have funds deposited. That is where the order book comes from. That is why you can buy or sell hundreds of bitcoins without moving the price.

When Tim Berners-Lee and colleagues created the foundations for today's web they did so patent and royalty free because they believed the technology and applications were too important to limit and exploit for financial gain. 
I think we can all agree that the people who came after them, and built on top of what they'd done, did not share those same philosophies. 
Satoshi clearly believed that the government bailouts of failing banks were wrong and an inappropriate use of the power our governments currently wield, and I agree with that. But did Satoshi ever give an opinion on state-funded education? Did he have a stated opinion on environmental protection or universal healthcare?

Once a year/50,000 blocks? That would be determined by the blockchain size that could reasonably be accommodated by individuals. 


The previous blocks don't have to be lost, but they also don't need to be kept. So if you've got a data centre with petabytes of storage; keep the whole blockchain. If not; drop everything prior to the last checkpoint.

You make a lot of good points, but this one just isn't true. Everyone has noticed the relative stability of the bitcoin price recently. That is because lots of people are storing *lots* of money, both fiat and bitcoins, on the major exchanges. Yes, they are knowingly taking that risk and are responsible for their own actions. But if Bitstamp, Bitfinex or BTC-E went belly-up it would be a huge hit to the bitcoin economy just as gox was. 
Added to that, if the bitcoin economy continues to grow then the value of assets held on exchanges will also increase proportionally. If we want to be able to absorb swings in the supply/demand caused by for example black-friday cyber-monday type sales then there will have to be hundreds of miilions of dollars sitting in limit buy orders to provide liquidity.

The concept of bitcoin as a global currency relies on [a whole bunch of changes]( being made to accomodate more than 7 transaction per second.

Umm, in a sense, yes. Gox had major problems for about a year before crashing, but I suspect even towards the end they were still picking up more new customers than Vault of Satoshi or Kraken by simple virtue of being big. 
Also, the whole concept of publicly auditable exchanges means no fractional reserve, which means no use of customer funds for business expenses, which means new exchanges need very large investments at start-up. And all of that creates the same barrier to entry as the current banking licences.

Just a bit of constructive criticism: this probably isn't the way to do it. Customer deposits, whether bitcoin or fiat, should be ring-fenced separately from operating funds. So an audit like this should show 100% exactly. 
Of course the important thing is that you've got the funds covered. But by lumping together business funds and customer funds implies that you treat them the same way and could therefore dip into customer funds to pay for expenses.

Technically a boom can happen because the sellers stop selling. There are two sides to supply and demand.

If you were actually a loyal long time Bitcoin enthusiast then you must have been told hundreds of times that you need to secure *your* bitcoins in *your* wallet. Not on an exchange. Not with Inputs.io. Nor anywhere else that required you to trust someone else with your money.

You do something of great value, of course you deserve to be rewarded. Maybe you do something of such great value that you can sit back and chill for the rest of your life. But, inspite of inflation and inheritance taxes etc, there are people around today with more money than they know what to do with because their great great great grandad made a lot of money 200 years ago.

I'm no fan of altcoins but his point is valid. The biggest distinguishing feature of bitcoin over altcoins is the first mover advantage. That market cap you referenced is what separates bitcoin from Litecoin et al. But if bitcoins valuation crashes and people are selling for "pennies on the dollar" then that advantage will be gone.
The ATMs could be converted to trade any other cryto-currency with a software update. Overstock took two weeks to implement bitcoin payments, it would take them two hours to switch to a different coin.
So by all means cheer and smirk as the price falls. But every time the the ticker drops another dollar bitcoin becomes less and less distinguishable from any other crypto.

The big drops that happen on huge news, like mtgox collapse, are less scary because markets tend to overreact and then correct themselves. 
This drop is happening after months of stable prices, so there are lots of people seeing the bitcoins they bought become worth less and less than they paid for them. There is no catastrophic news for people to overreact to, so where is the correction going to come from?

You can ask the big bitcoin-accepting companies how much bitcoin they have accepted. Or even ask Bitpay/Coinbase how much they have processed.

It's not just a function of the fiat banking system. If you used local bitcoins or Mycelium local trader or whatever, the rate you get for buying bitcoins is less favourable than the rate businesses accept them at.

I think you're underestimating the variance that miners seem to worry over so much. 
With ~50% of the hashing power the probability of Ghash finding 6 blocks in a row is about 1.6% i.e. it's going to happen sometimes, and it does. The probability of them missing 6 blocks in a row is the same. So no-one is going to worry just because they haven't published a block for an hour. 
After 2 or 3 hours there might be a response, but what exactly happens there? What do the other miners do to prevent the attack? And how quickly do you think those other miners will actually react?

I'm saying that if the crashing price of the last couple of days had been the temporary effect of the Ethereum sell off then we could reasonably expect prices to rise back upwards when the sell off finished. 
But if what we're seeing is just a trader reaction to the announcement of the sell off. Then the market, which has just fallen ~18% in two days, still has to absorb that massive amount of coins being dumped. 
Maybe "cheap coins" sounds great to you, and I might well buy some more too. But to all the bystanders and naysayers bitcoin was finally looking like it had reached a stable reliable point. Now those people are back to thinking it's just a big speculative tulip-ponzi-bubble. So I don't think this crash is going to help user adoption very much.

I don't see the contradiction because you're still having to exaggerate my position to create one.


Because democracy works on majority rule. So all you need is for the majority of people to make a rational decision, and sometimes they do.
Besides, the election issue is a relatively simple one. Lots of the cases where people argue that incentives make regulation unnecessary are far more complex and less predictable.
People argue that miners, mining companies, and pools won't do certain things because it would harm the value of bitcoins and that would hurt their profits right? So why did Ghash amass over 50% of the hash rate? Why did individual miners keep pointing new machines at that pool? 
People argue that. BTC-e won't run off with customer's funds because they can make more money from fees in the long term. So far that had held true, but have you ever seen research on delayed gratification? Some people can wait patiently for the promise of bigger returns, others will take the guaranteed short term win. 
In short; when you create an incentive you're hoping, unrealistically, that everyone will respond to it the same way. When you create a regulation you're legally requiring that everyone follows it.

First up; Ben Lawsky got the job he now has by successfully prosecuting major banks for money laundering. You make it sound like the regulators are coming after Bitcoin instead of the banks, as if they're the world's worst multi-taskers. Do you know why everyone on knows about HSBC secretly getting away with laundering money for cartels? Because they didn't get away with it! They were investigated, they were prosecuted, they were fined billions of dollars and they were plastered all over the front pages of the international press. 
Secondly; Bitcoin is a tiny market because its only existed for five years. As everyone here knows, the value of bitcoins has been increasing exponetially over the last few years and, if that trend continues, the bitcoin market could be worth trillions of dollars in a few short years. 
The suggestion that South American drug cartels or international terrorist organisations aren't using Bitcoin yet really doesn't matter to regulators. What matters is whether Bitcoin is going to make money laundering easier. It's perfectly reasonable for them to investigate the technology and we shouldn't be surprised if they try to impose the same safeguards on Bitcoin financial services that they already impose of banks.

If someone tries to buy $17 million worth of bitcoin they would shift the price up substantially. If someone tried to sell $17 million worth they would move the price down substantially. 
The only thing we know for certain about the auction is that someone is selling $17 million worth of bitcoin. The hope that major players will come in and bid over the odds to get these coins now is speculation. It may or may not happen, but the coins will be sold either way. So I guess the default state is lower than market because it doesn't require the appearance of agressively enthusiastic bidders who for some reason weren't buying on exchanges.

Oil companies don't like electric cars because it messes with their long established and highly lucrative business model.
In the same way banks, central or otherwise, don't like Bitcoin. Obviously there are obvious transparent ways for them to attack Bitcoin's growth like blacklisting transfers to and from Bitcoin businesses. But I wouldn't be at all surprised if they sought out more inventive ways to undermine confidence in Bitcoin.
If I were a shady person payed millions of dollars to attack Bitcoin this is what I would do:
First, find out the identities and locations of the people controlling the major mining pools. 
Second, infect their systems, or just point a gun at their head and gain control. 
Third perpetrate a massive double spends against some of the most well known Bitcoin accepting businesses.
Fourth make sure every major news site got the story ASAP.

That all sounds sensible except the point about a new wave of hobbyist miners joining the network. 
The bigger mining operations benifit from economies of scale, so even if a mining exodus occurs they will be the last ones standing. The exodus should also halt around the point where these big mining operations are covering their costs. So at that point your hobbyist would have to shell out thousands for a shiny new mining rig, pay higher residential electricity costs, and still achieve a lower cost per hash than Cex or Asicminer. That would never happen.

The fact that bitcoins have lost half their value over the last few months, and the fact that they are up 400% over the last year both equate to the same thing; massive instability. 
A lot of bitcoiners view central banks as simple money-printing machines designed to devalue our money, and over the last few years that's exactly what they've been. But the actual purpose of central banks and their monetary policies is to try to achieve stable, slightly inflating, currency values that enable stable economic activity.

While I agree it would be extremely handy to use a vending machine without fumbling for change, I understand why there aren't any around yet. 
1. Vending companies kicked up a storm in UK when the size of 10p coins changed because of how much it would cost to refit all their machines. The same or likely much greater cost would be required to enable Bitcoin payments. 
2. Vending machines make money by selling small value items to very large numbers of people. Currently Bitcoin users are few and far between. So, with the exception of evangelists making a pilgrimage to the first Bitcoin coke machine, they would likely get few if any customers paying with bitcoins.

They do this because they can. eBay is by far the biggest most well known auction site around, and the average man in the street couldn't even name a competitor. 
If I recall correctly Bitpay offers free payment processing up to one million USD. They don't do that because they are super nice guys. They do it because they have VC funding that allows them to operate at a loss for several years, and having this offer in place makes it extremely difficult for anyone else to compete with them.

If the opposite process never occurs then the end result would be thousands of ever smaller countries, completely at odds with their nearest neighbours.

You need lots more proof. 
If an individual tracks the price of all the goods and services they buy in a period. Then a year later does the same tracking. That would give them an estimate of the inflation rate as it directly impacts them. But that's still a shitty estimate of the true inflation rate because your data set is tiny and is biased depending on that individual's lifestyle. 
People feel like the government is mangling and skewing statistics to downplay the inflation rate, but a much simpler explanation is the combination of samplng bias and perception bias (you're more likely to notice prices going up than prices going down).

Just replying to myself to add that [this article]( neatly sums up why companies will be disinclined to back their rewards programs with cryptographically proveable reserves. 
From the article there are three ways that rewards points cost the company far less than they are actually "worth": 
1.    Forfeiture. Many programs allow for some accounts to be cancelled, e.g., in the event of inactivity, with all points forfeited
2.    Breakage. In any program, there is some level of breakage, i.e., a significant number of points earned will never be redeemed, even among members who remain active customers
3.    Reward leverage. The actual cost of a point is generally lower than the perceived redemption value (this is referred to as “reward leverage”)
Bitcoin backing would mean they have to ignore these three things and set aside huge sums of money in bitcoin that they never actually expect to pay out.

Please people; bitcoin is supposed to be a global thing but this thread, like thousands before it, will enevitably have a bunch of people pointing out that many banking systems in many parts of the world make the apparently shitty US system look like the fucking stoneage. 
Most of my (UK-&gt;UK) bank transfers complete in an hour or maybe two during working hours. I have internet banking (with a free 2fa device), phone banking, branch access and an iphone app. I have a current account with an interest free overdraft, a tax-free saving account, a brokerage account, a credit card and a debit card. I have all of these things free of charge. 
The services provided by my bank go far beyond anything on offer from bitcoin companies so far, and much though I like bitcoin there is no way i'm going to give all that stuff up and start fretting over whether the paper wallets containing my life savings are safe or if my encryption passwords are strong enough.

You're vastly oversimplifying the capitalist economy. Here is a marginaly less simplified version:

2. Middle class people buy things they need and things they want. 
3. Rich people buy things they need, things they want, and things that other people can't afford to emphasise how rich they are. 
There are entire industries devoted to the production and distribution of luxury goods so that rich people have something to spend their money on. You may think that those industries are a pointless waste of resources, but they serve as an outlet for wealthy people to feed their wealth back to into the economy.

I would think the biggest problem is still volatility. The required funding for most projects is going to be denominated in their local fiat currency, while the value of bitcoin donations will vary day to day. 
Over the course of a month-long funding campaign your pledges are supposed to go from 0% to 100%+. A bitcoin accepting campaign could go from 0% to 150%, then back to 90% on the final day. Projects that don't reach their funding target are supposed to give the money back.

Transactions are information and take up a certain amount of space. Currently each block in the blockchain is constrained to be less than 1mb\*, which means there is a limit to how many transactions it can contain. With this limit in place the Bitcoin network is limited to about 7\* transactions per second and if the level of activity exceeds this limit then transactions will end up taking longer to confirm. 
The simplest solution is to increase the arbitrary 1mb block limit allowing for a higher rate of transactions. But every person running the full Bitcoin client needs to store the entire blockchain. Not everyone wants to increase their storage capacity by several gigabytes per day, so the problem remains.

If Overstock is doing $15k per day then it's likely that total daily usage is not even keeping up with the 3600 freshly mined coins yet. We could have increasing adoption with relatively stable prices for quite a long time before bitcoins actually became scarce.

BTC is down 20% this week against the [british pound]( and the [Euro]( and every other major currency. I believe there is an exchange that lets you trade BTC against gold, and I feel confident saying that today a bitcoin will buy you ~20% less gold than it did a couple of days ago.
So the value isn't changing specifically in relation to the USD, it's just generally dropping.

You're right, and the theory goes that people are taking a calculated risk to protect their financial privacy. But do you really believe people are actually *calculating* a risk here? Does the average man in the street - or even the average bitcoiner on this sub - actually have access to enough information to judge the risk they are taking? 
That's the major problem I have with the idea of the market regulating itself. It works really well if you're an experience actuary with limitless spare time. But most people's analysis of BTC-e would go something like:


That sort of rationalisation works right up until it doesn't, and every time BTC-e gains a new customer they have a slightly larger incentive to shut-down and walk away with people's money.

What you're saying is that if public schools shut down, decreasing the supply of education, while the demand remained constant; prices would go down. 
In one sense you're probably correct. There would be thousands of new private schools in a race to the bottom, streamlining, cutting costs and generally trying to provide the cheapest minimum level of education. But I don't want my kids, or anyone else's kids, to go to a school run by Ryanair. 
You've said elsewhere that deregulated (and I assume privatised) industries always show positive results. I think much of the UK would disagree with you. We privatised our railways and since there is no real competition we have watched the prices creep up and up. We privatised our energy sector and now we have an investigation into whether the major companies are rigging the market.

Well if the market operates efficiently then the costs incurred by the miners (hardware, electricity, bandwith etc.) should roughly equal the mining rewards. I'm not saying that happens yet but when and if bitcoin prices become stable long-term an equilibrium should be reached. 
As for the second point; all the infrastructure and security is there to provide a transaction network. As far as I know there is no 51% attack that would allow someone to move my cold storage bitcoins? So it's the transaction component that requires all the expense.

I just don't see how that could work efficiently for something like water. Having several overlapping networks means several times as many cracked pipes leaking beneath busy city-centre streets, and that's even without those private companies "accidentally" damaging each other's infrastructure. In the meantime rural areas would be completely neglected or would have to pay insane sums just to get something as basic as running water. In this particular case I just don't see where any cost savings would come from. 
But I'm glad we can agree that balance, at whatever point it is achieved, is good.

My thoughts on changetip are that I like the principle but not the current application. 
If you find a really great post or comment and decide to give them gold, a little gold icon pops up next to their post. If you find a pretty good post or comment and decide to tip them 25 cents then you have to create a comment that no-one wanted to read and, unless set to private(?), a second comment is posted by changetip. 
That's all great publicity for bitcoin, but to the majority of redditors, or twitterers, or anyone else it looks a whole lot like spam. 
In the best case scenario where changetip really does catch on, comments sections will be full of hundreds of posts that don't really add anything to the conversation beyond "Great article, here's a tiny amount of money". So unless Reddit incorporates tips as a native thing to replace or augment Reddit gold; I suspect they will end up banning it, either directly or through the mods of major subreddits.

Public education is paid for despite many people not being able to afford it because: 
1. The cost is spread between those with children and those without.
2. The cost is unevenly distributed between the rich and the poor.
Now I don't have kids and might never have them, so of course I'm not a fan of paying to educate other people's kids. What's more I would love to say that if people can't afford to raise kids they shouldn't have them. But that's not what happens. Poor education leads to poor prospects. Poor prospects leads to greater dependence on family support, and that leads poor uneducated people to have larger numbers of children.

If the CHF becomes "too strong" Swiss exporters will struggle. People across the world will stop eating increasingly expensive chocolate or buying cuckoo clocks. In the meantime Swiss locals will be buying more and more imports because it's cheaper than locally produced goods. 
With the export and local markets grinding to a halt most Swiss manufacturers and service providers will see profits plunging and will have to scale back operations. Unemployment will rise, tax receipts will fall and the government will find itself with an unsustainable deficit. 
Now with the economy in a rough state people will start to doubt the Swiss government's ability to pay back it's CHF debts and so it won't look like such a safe haven afterall. As wealthy investors pull their money out the CHF value will crash.
So now your CHFs are lowered in value anyway, 20% of the country are unemployed, and the government can't afford to fund it's generous social programs. Happy?

I'll concede that the US system is undoubtedly more complex than a simple free market but blaming every fault and failing on the states involvement seems a little convenient. 
Do you really believe that over half the adult population gets health insurance through their employers because 70 years ago the government temporarily banned raises? 
Even if that were true why do you think private companies are so much worse at negotiating a good deal than the individual employees would be? If anything i'd expect the companies to get a better deal overall. 
The problem as I see it is that the structure of health insurance doesn't fit with the simple supply vs demand concept. 
The relationship between customer and insurance company works fine, offer a good service cheaper than your competitors and you win. That should lead to healthy competition and lower prices (even if state licences are required). But the insurance companies also have to deal with the pharma companies, and they can't really afford to shop around and hard ball the negotiations. 
That's why treatments in the US end up costing multiple times what they cost for the national health services in other parts of the world, and those massively inflated costs get passed on to the consumer.
Even if the government withdrew entirely from the US healthcare system, insurance companies would still get gouged by the pharma companies because they don't have enough bargaining power.

That's all true, but I think the scheme you're describing is reliant on a predictable market response. i.e. He sells a ton of goxBTC at already massively depressed prices, causes panic selling from customers, and then buys back the goxBTC at *even lower* prices. If people don't react the way he expects, if they decide the price has gone too low and it's time to buy, then he is screwed and ends up with even bigger problems. 
The manipulative arbitrage strategy using a second exchange may be more exposed, but it's financially fool proof. 
Something in between the two would be if he bought up the current glut of cheap goxBTC to cover the Bitcoin balance sheet, announced limited Bitcoin withdrawals, waited for the price to shoot up again as people try to get their funds out, and then sell off at higher prices to cover the fiat balance sheet.

That is exactly the problem I have with OP's version of this story. 
If the police have been conducting hundreds of sting operations on Local Bitcoins sellers, and if they are trying to set a rock-solid legal precedent, why the hell would they choose an innocent person for their high profile prosecution?
Are we to assume that none of the sellers on Local Bitcoins agreed to do a dodgy deal? Are they all too morally righteous to deal with credit card thiefs or drug users? Or are they exclusively shrewd operators who can spot an undercover sting operation a mile away? Of course they're fucking not!

Here I agree that mtgox is likely refusing to let people withdraw their money because mtgox doesn't have the funds to cover it. However that isn't what gox has said in public.


Here you are buying what gox is selling, while the court of public opinion suggests gox is using transaction malleability as a cover for the fact they don't have enough funds to cover all their customer's withdrawals. 
No-one knows for sure what is true because, as an unregulated company, gox doesn't have to report their accounts to anyone. 
I'm not advocating for time-travel regulations that would crush the exchanges before they got started. But I think there have been enough failed exchanges, which crashed and burned with substantial customer funds, for an argument for licencing to hold weight. That doesn't mean every Bitcoin business needs to be licenced. But those that are taking direct responsibility for other people's money should be held to higher standards.

It's different because demand for gold comes from a variety of different angles. Right now the major demand for gold is as an investment, then as shiny jewelry, then as a metal with useful properties.

Bitcoin wasn't premined. It just didn't attract a large number of miners in the beginning. 
When people launch new altcoins they fully expect that a bunch of people will jump on the mining bandwagon within a few days.

You can regulate the businesses that accept bitcoin payments. You can require exchanges to record and report the banking and address details of every customer.

I don't even see how bitcoin gets past the concept of income taxes. 
In the UK the vast majority of people use the [PAYE]( system, meaning that income taxes, national insurance, student loans etc are subtracted before your paycheque ever reaches your bank account. So the only way bitcoin would liberate most people from income taxes is if their employer agreed to help facilitate tax-evasion.

That's what I'm getting at. A large portion of the (UK) population don't have half their income taxed, because their income is pretty low. Someone earning £30k a year pays ~£6,645 in tax. There's no way that would cover private school tuition even if competition brought the costs down.

Hell, the simplest thing that no-one here has pointed out is that the text-book bubble chart used at the start of the article doesn't actually predict the death of a technology or asset. The very last step is a return to the mean trendline, i.e. slower growth. 
But instead we get comments that boil down to "herp-derp she's fucking dumb". I'm sure the people linking to the author's contact details are sincerely encouraging constructive critisism and feedback, and certainly aren't expecting people to flood this reporter with vicious abusive messages.

The problem I see with this is that bitcoin actually makes it slightly easier to catch-out those existing tax evaders. 
Currently if the taxman wants to prove that your restaurant if failing to declare their full takings, that would be quite difficult. 
With bitcoin payments all he needs to do is send some secret shoppers to eat there. If any of their payments get sent to an undeclared address then you are clearly hiding earnings and are therefore screwed.
Given that an entire industry already exists around secret shopping the taxman doesn't even have to set this up. All they need to do is require those secret shopper companies to declare their bitcoin payments.

It's very clearly true that communism hasn't worked out very well for most if not all of the countries that used it. But communism is an extreme extension of socialism. I don't think any concept like that is universally applicable, and the same goes for free market capitalism. 
If you compare the US health care system (free market) to basically any of the European state-run systems then you find that the free market just doesn't work properly in that particular scenario. 
In the UK our water industry is privatised. That doesn't mean I can choose which company provides my water because that would be ridiculous. It just means that the money I pay goes to maintenance of the system *plus* shareholder profits.

I'd agree with you that massively onerous regulation would/will stifle innovation if other regions don't follow suit. But too many people around these parts seem to operate in a weirdly simplistic binary. "Sometimes regulations are bad, therefore all regulation is bad and there should be none."
The bitlicence in whatever form it ends up is supposed to prevent clueless idiots with no backing from setting up financial services companies, and in doing so prevent other idiots from losing their money with said companies. 
I know some people think that the invisible hand of the free market can fix things without regulation. But after mtgox, inputs.io, bitcoin24, bitcoinica and dozens of others, BTC-e is still one of the biggest exchanges in the world.

I should wait for Moronic Monday to ask this, but why couldn't Bitcoin incorporate a periodic "re-genesis block". i.e. a single block that states the location of all current bitcoins, effectively summarising the outcome of all the previous transactions. 
That block would obviously be huge, but it would be considerably smaller than the entire preceding blockchain. Once that giant block had been sufficiently validated people could drop the previous blockchain freeing up giga/tera/peta-bytes of storage space.

In the first instance the foundation is influential because "outsiders" will look for some central body to interact with, because that is what they are used to. 
In the longer term the foundation will still be influential because they are a group of people who collectively own very substantial amounts of bitcoins, and who run some of the biggest businesses in the bitcoin space. Assuming the board members actually agree on things, this voting block will have far more sway over the direction bitcoin takes than the 120,000+ subscribers ever could.

I think it's worth pointing out that the only reason so little gold is used industrially is because it's so expensive. If it did stop being used as a store of value then the price would drop and the industrial uses would pick-up. That's why people talk about the "intrinsic value" of gold, because it's valuation has a floor based on physical usefullness.

Individually this is true. Collectively it is false. If no-one can trust an exchange enough to leave their money/bitcoins there then the exchange will have a ridiculously thin order book. That means more susceptibility to manipulation and *even more* wildly gyrating prices than we currently have. 
The only way Bitcoin can gain widespread adoption is through stability, and the only way to get stability is to have trustworthy exchanges with deep orderbooks.

It *is* pretty stupid though. 
If they did release the sale price then we would have two estimates of the current value of bitcoins. 
1. Based on hundreds of thousands of people trading back and forth in open transparent markets. 
2. Based on a few dozen people making blind bids in a secret auction. 
Added to that, we know that all lots were won by one person. So the auction sale price isn't even an estimate of what those few dozen people think bitcoins are worth. It's just Tim Draper's personal opinion. 
Curious though I am, I would be very disappointed with the world if the exchange market moved on mass to align with one guy's guess.

The point about data on the bitcoin economy is that even though all transactions are public (except those handled within e.g. Coinbase) we can't tell which of those are economic activity, and which are just people shuffling their coins around between addresses.

I've never used BTC-e and I don't want to see it fail either. Another major exchange disappearing with tens or hundreds of millions of dollars of customer funds would put another horrific dent in bitcoin's reputation and send prices crashing.
But just because I don't want it to fail doesn't mean I don't expect it to fail. With no reputation on the line and no expectations of legal repercussions the owners have a simple cost-benefit calculation.

If the government banned businesses from accepting bitcoin then your local Chinese restaurant won't accept bitcoin.
If there is no ban and you local Chinese restaurant accepts bitcoin and conceals profits to evade taxes, then the tax authorities will send round mystery shoppers to pay in bitcoin. The transaction will be easily traceable and the owner will be prosecuted for tax evasion. This is far easier with bitcoin than with cash.

Real time cryptographic audits work great for Bitcoin and other cryptographic currencies. But as far as I know they can't be applied to fiat currencies. So exchanges, which necessarily deal with fiat deposits, can never be fully transparent through the use of cryptographic audits. 
If public transparency is impossible then I would say that some form of industry standard (i.e. frequent external audits and certain minimum security practices) is the next best thing. That can be certainly be achieved through self-regulating industry groups. But that hasn't happened for bitcoin exchanges.

I still think you're misunderstanding my example a little. The "bank-coin" wouldn't be the national monetary system, it would be a parallel system for balancing the books between banks in a quick and trustless way. 
The point being that there are plenty of applications for ledgers where a particular group of participants need a trustless system that works between them, and only between them. They don't necessarily want a publicly viewable ledger, and they don't necessarily want a ledger whose security is provided by a lot of anonymous participants.

I don't agree, and I don't think you would actually get any sort of universal agreement from "Bitcoin engineers". If a hard-fork is implemented in a responsible way with a high enough activation threshold and long enough grace period, I think it is perfectly reasonable to leave non-upgraded nodes to their own fate. 
As you mentioned earlier Microsoft no longer supports Windows XP. I still have a rusty little homebuilt shuttle under my desk that has XP installed. If I decide to use that computer to do my online banking, or manage my bitcoins, I'm not going to sue Microsoft when my money is stolen. I can't. 
With Bitcoin it's even simpler than that. Bitcoin is a network not a company. No individual, group, or organisation is legally responsible for your bitcoins, and it's your responsibility to make sure that you aren't running massively out of date software. That's was the position ultimately take with the [0.8 accidental fork]( and non upgrading nodes were booted off the network less than 6 months later.
Edit: I missed the part about softfork being quicker and less disruptive. But I'm just going to refer back to my belief that implementing the hard-fork code first, then releasing new features (by softfork or otherwise) during the activation period is the best way to safely reach a necessary "consensus" hard-fork.
@_date: 2017-02-27 19:41:46
It's pretty simple really:
* Some people don't support a hardfork because it's dangerous.
* It's dangerous because a "contentious" hardfork might split the network into two persistent chains.
* A hardfork might be contentious if a significant minority of the community didn't support it.
* Some people don't support a hardfork because it's dangerous.
If you force people to break out of this perfect circle then you'll get some very weak arguments that larger blocks will prevent people from running a full node on their 2004 laptop. But really if a handful of outspoken Core developers were to actually propose a long term conservative blocksize scaling, there would be no contention.

Does anyone think we are not approaching the 1mb limit? I thought the three main competing arguments were:
1. We're approaching the limit and should raise it to 20mb in a reasonable timeframe.
2. We're approaching the limit but any increase requires a hard-fork, so we should come up with a long-term solution (like a limit that automatically increases ever X blocks) rather than a quick fix that will only buy us a few years of growth.
3. We're approaching the limit and should leave it in place to see how the network responds in terms of transaction fees etc.

However, when the 0.14 candidate was posted, Greg decided to spend his time switching seamlessly between giving "mature and patient" answers to questions on this sub, while giving immature and unhelpful responses on rbtc. 
As I said, he did *eventually* post a more useful response elsewhere in that thread. But only after numerous people had noted that a leading Bitcoin developer was basically trolling instead of answering legitimate questions.
Cryptolution is choosing to selectively ignore the huge proportion of deliberately unhelpful comments Greg makes on rbtc, and paint him as some saintly figure enduring unprovoked attacks while just trying to spread knowledge wherever he can. 
The reality is that Greg dedicates a solid hour or two per day to actively pissing off the rbtc community, so that they'll respond with nasty comments, so that and others can highlight those comments as evidence of the sub's "toxic" nature.

I'm not saying that people haven't manipulated node counts in the past. I'm saying that if you acknowledge and accuse people of easily manipulating a metric you can't then use that same metric as some sort of democratic measure of support for SegWit.
Node counts are either real representative measures of community support or they are easily faked and therefore worthless (it's the latter). You can't have it both ways.
Saying the Core node count "look like organic" doesn't mean anything. A single individual could have a deployment script run twice a day to start a new hosted node. It would look more organic, but it still wouldn't represent  the community.

I didn't suggest that Greg is, or should be, non human. I pointed out that your comment about how mature and patient the Core devs are, and how terrible rbtc and Roger Ver are, doesn't really add up. 
Try to find some posts from Greg on rbitcoin where he answers genuine questions with unhelpful jokes? If he's just a guy with a sense of humour then surely he makes jokes and serious comments on both subs, right?
Except he doesn't. He very clearly behaves and responds differently when commenting on rbtc. That sub can be aggressive and unpleasant and overly focussed on personal attacks sometimes. And that's exactly the way Greg and other trolls want it to be.

That's not my argument. 
A user running the latest Core client "supports" SegWit in the technical sense that their node will validate SegWit transactions. They don't necessarily "support" SegWit in a philosophical sense, and it doesn't matter how technically knowledgeable they may be. 
Your post title states that more than 50% of nodes are SegWit ready. This is accurate. 
Your comments throughout this sub infer that over 50% of the Bitcoin community therefore wants SegWit. This might be true, or it might not, you don't have any reliable evidence for that and are drawing the conclusions that you want.

Can you provide any quote by any notable economist about Bitcoin prior to 2011?
There's two reasons why "no" is the answer:
1. It wasn't on the mainstream radar until then.
2. Economists deal in long term trends, so no rational economist is going to say "I give it six months" even if they are convinced Bitcoin will ultimately fail.

In this case you absolutely *could* prove you are not doing something thanks to the traceability of bitcoin transactions. 
OP is apparently buying "a few bitcoins a week", so is clearly doing one of three things: 
1. Saving up a big stockpile of bitcoins. Can prove this by signing a message from the holding address(es) to show he still controls most of what he's bought.
2. Buying a shit ton of bed sheets from Overstock. Can proof this by showing the receipts/transaction details/whatever.
3. Selling the coins on local bitcoins/mycelium/wherever. Doesn't need to prove this because it's what they are accusing him of.

Your number has dropped but you still haven't actually provided any source for it. I'm starting to think you might just be going with your gut or - to put it another way - pulling numbers out of your arse.


Since you can't seem to actually cite any facts I don't know how that is impacting your beliefs.


Of course it matters if they think there is a better way. You're now trying to define "consensus" to include anyone who is cajoled, browbeaten, or threatened into accepting changes at the risk of losing their market share.

@_date: 2017-02-28 22:10:05
Greg and Luke sometimes are sometimes dismissed and ridiculed. 
Sometimes that's because they've well earned that ridicule i.e. When Luke "fulfilled" his part of the Hong-Kong agreement by proposing to hardfork *down* to 300KB and then gradually scale up to 2MB over the next 7 years. Or Greg spending hours per day baiting of the rbtc community. 
But mostly it's because a hard-fork blocksize increase proposal is only contentious at this time because those guys *made it* contentious. 
As I previously said; Gavin and Jeff tried to address the blocksize problem a long time before we hit the transaction capacity wall. Whether you, or Greg, or Luke, agreed with their particular proposals doesnt matter. That was the right time to work out this problem and come to "consensus" on a scaling proposal that wouldn't destroy the network, but also wouldn't rely on the development of other 2nd layer networks. Instead Greg (and others) sat in the front row shouting "boo, you suck. 20MB is dumb!" while carefully *not* stating what he thought would be a reasonable blocksize cap.
If the handful of outspoken "small blocker" Core devs had genuinely engaged back then we wouldn't have this contention today. We'd probably have already activated a modest blocksize scaling proposal. SegWit (with or without its discount) would have activated in 6 weeks, and we'd all be living happily ever after.

The difficulty adjustment doesn't happen every two weeks. It happens every 2016 blocks. The difficulty adjusts to a level where 2016 blocks will take roughly two weeks. But in OP's scenario the crippled chain would take at least 20 times as long to mine each block. The difficulty retargeting could therefore take up to 40 weeks.

Google hangouts, google plus, google wave. Those are all examples of a massive company trying to break into a market that they aren't really part of (much like Microsoft bing). 
You could've said that Facebook was worried about WhatsApp or Snapchat. That would've been more in keeping with the point you're trying to argue. The problem is that when FB really starts to worry about competition they just buy them.
If mining becomes highly profitable again there will be increases in the hash rate. If we're lucky those increases will come from one or more major companies investing hundreds of millions to set up a mining data centre with the latest most efficient ASICs. If we're unlucky it will be the same handful of existing mining companies upgrading their equipment, making it even harder for new players to enter the market.
But either way there isn't likely to be some massive new wave of decentralisation. The existing mining companies have the right contacts and infrastructure to get the latest generation of chips first, and the major outside companies have the capital to try and break into the already competitive market. New companies, like 21 inc, only have hype and gimmicks on their side.

I think I might be doing the maths wrong, But: 
If you had bought one bitcoin at $240 and subsequently sold it for $10k, you'd pay at most 20% long term capital gains in the US, leaving you with just over $8k.
If you bought 6.7 GBTC shares for $240 and sold them tax free when bitcoin hit $10k, you'd end up with $6.7k. 
Am I doing it wrong? It seems like the current price premium is so much higher than the tax rate that it will never work out.

Ok. I think you're probably right that few if any Core devs have suggested "no hard-forks, ever!" Though it's sometimes hard to disentangle the developer's stance from their most vocal supporters.
I definitely think you're right that a hard-fork is not something to be undertaken lightly or in a rushed fashion. That's at the heart of why this situation has been so frustrating. 
Gavin didn't raise and pursue this topic in 2015 to cause some sort of false drama. He did it because he knew it might take a long time to come to an agreement, and longer still to safely implement a hard-fork.
It's also worth noting that Jeff Garzik voiced his concerns about the unintended consequences of the blocksize cap way back when it was introduced in 2010. He practically predicted this whole situation half a decade before it came about. 
It's actually pretty rare to find people who really think and plan ahead like that, and I think if people had genuinely engaged in that discussion in 2015 we could have had a conservative blocksize hard-fork with broad developer support and a long, safe activation period. 
Instead we had Maxwell and others shooting down the proposals that Gavin and Jeff made as being "dangerous" without offering an alternative proposal. That sort of obstructive heckling behaviour does make it look like some of the current Core devs were/are dead against hardforking ever, or at least not until it suits their own purposes.
@_date: 2017-02-28 20:57:16
This is an issue that was known about and discussed long before the blocksize wars began and numerous people have proposed numerous ways of preventing the issue, including simply capping the maximum size of a transaction (although I'll admit it would be if we introduced a somewhat arbitrary static limit that ended up constricting bitcoins usefulness in the future).
It's a great example of something that only seems to be an issue when people want it to be an issue. I don't think any of the Core developers would claim that this is an unsolvable issue, they just (sensibly) say that any blocksize increase should also include a fix for this.

The automobile started out as an individual level technology. Then companies and local governments forked that technology to produce buses. 
Buses are less useful than having a car because the routes are restricted and they generally travel slower over the same distance due to all the stops. But on the other hand buses allow people to take advantage of automobile technology without the hassle of learning to drive or the costs of maintaining and securing a car.
In more recent decades governments have encouraged the use of buses by putting in place special bus lanes or entire regions of city centres that cars are not allowed to access. Thus buses can work out faster in certain cases due to government intervention.

I don't see how that explains anything. Was Soupernerd the source for these rumors? Greg says "a number of people" so it seems unlikely it could all be traced back to one specific user. 
Regardless, the traditional route for stopping a libelous rumor would be to present evidence against it. In this case it sounds (from Greg's description) like he could have easily shown that the Juniper stuff was impossible. 
Instead he made a carefully constructed series of posts attacking one of the mods and creating as much drama as possible. So if you mean that Greg took action to defend himself by deliberately stirring up a public witch-hunt against someone else, then yeah I can see that.

Now I wouldn't be surprised if that page gets changed to match with Gregs revisionist history.

It depends on your interpretation, and how blockchain evidence is applied.
There have been some cases of DNA evidence being misinterpreted or over-interpreted, particularly in its early days.

@_date: 2017-02-11 14:49:30


Yes. As I understand it everyone agrees that a hardfork would require a substantial activation period, potentially years. With that in mind everyone who genuinely believes the hardfork will be necessary at some point should be pushing for it to be implemented as soon as possible. Partly because that would actually *start* the clock on that activation period, and partly because any subsequent desirable features that are released during the activation period would encourage more users to upgrade their nodes.
@_date: 2017-02-12 00:19:04


The devs don't need to force it on users but so far they have refused to offer it as an option. If Core released a sensible blocksize hardfork implementation (not Luke's trolling crap) and a year later the activation requirements hadn't been met we'd know it really *really* was a contentious issue. Right now all we have is a very vocal group of people who have grabbed onto some weird ever-shifting definition of "consensus" telling us that it can't be done.

In the event that network usage actually reaches the block limit "pay and pray" is exactly what people are going to be doing. A lot of people in this discussion seem to be advocating for a free market "supply vs demand" situation without understanding how that relationship works. 
In most cases demand rises exceeding demand, prices rapidly rise, and supply increases to restore balance. 
The block size isn't adaptive, the supply can only increase with a hard fork and that isn't something we could do safely in a short timeframe. In the meantime the cost of transactions would skyrocket. 
But you're right; some people would stop making transactions for small scale stuff. Spamming, Micro-transactions, paying for pizza or coffee or alpaca socks. You know, all those products from merchants that people spent years persuading to use bitcoin.
People keep calling it an interesting experiment to see what happens. What happens is bitcoin gets it's reputation destroyed and by the time the cap is finally lifted no-one will care anymore. They'll all be switching to use something else.

If you determine "richer" and "poorer" in arbitrary units then inflation isn't a problem for you, is it? But that's not how you define those things.

So the title is ambiguously misleading. For anyone who didn't click; it's a list of the top 6 mining pools that are signalling SegWit. It isn't a statement saying that the top 6 mining pools *are* signalling SegWit.
It also misrepresent slushpool as supporting SegWit when in fact slushpool supports their individual miners ability to choose what they want to signal, and only a small proportion of those miners choose SegWit.
But mostly the article is shitty because it's not really an article. The author doesn't actually p have anything to say about these pools - or SegWit - so they just have paragraphs of meaningless padding with a weird scattering of the word "albeit", which I assume was on JP Buntix's word-of-the-day toilet roll this morning.

I don't think I buy this one. I genuinely *do* think the argument that the blocksize cap is some sort of philosophical tenet *is* completely bogus. I also strongly doubt anyone prior to about 2016 tried to make an equivalency between something like the 21 million coin limit and the 1MB blocksize limit. One is a basic foundational principle designed to make Bitcoin deflationary in the long term. The other was an arbitrarily chosen technical parameter to prevent spam/bloat that seemed sensible to Satoshi at the time he added it. 
I can't debate with someone who claims that the 1Mb blocksize was intended to be permanent because I don't believe them. I don't believe that they believe that position. It's not remotely supported by anything and really doesn't seem sensible. As people have asked before; if the limit didn't exist until today there would be virtually no support for introducing it and limiting Bitcoin in that way.

It's not really about the relative addictiveness of mushrooms and other drugs. 
His comments in the second and third paragraph make it sound like he was trying to build a universal marketplace for people to trade anything with anyone, and that the whole eBay of drugs that it evolved into was an unexpected accident. 
The fact that the very first thing he chose to sell was an illegal recreational drug suggests that was a lie.
He knew what he was building, he knew how people would likely use it, and he went out of his way to point them in that direction just incase it wasn't immediately obvious.

This whole post is about the biggest misunderstanding of basic economics I've ever seen.
At its heart inflation means one thing; work done in the future is more valuable than work done in the past. Deflation means the opposite. The more time that passes the more distorted the value becomes for things that are already done.
So if a guy builds a bridge over a river in 1900, that is useful work and they should get paid some amount of "money" for that work. They can then use that money as a claim against other people's work and resources in the future. 
If the currency is deflationary then it instantly becomes the case that the collective debt owed by society to Bridgy-McBuildalot is more than it would cost to build a brand new bridge. 
The more time that passes, the more distorted this valuation becomes. So in your immortality scenario a person who held a bake sale one time decades ago and saved the proceeds can use that money to build a super-yacht. How do you imagine that society functions? When 2 hours of baking in the 1990s is valued at the same level as thousands of hours of ship building in 2050?
@_date: 2015-05-10 23:07:20


You're wrong though. Many bitcoin companies are still quite small operations. If they're lucky they can afford to employ enough full-time customer support staff to respond to questions and problems that come in through the expected channels. But expecting them to also monitor a bunch of social media platforms and respond to problems there is a big stretch.
In reality one of two things happens. The company gets their reputation dragged through the mud. Or squeaky-wheel syndrome happens and the social media complainers get their issues fixed at the expense of many other customers who actually used the support system.
@_date: 2015-05-21 21:42:03
One possibility that people talk about is that banks and other financial institutions will end up using bitcoin for their interbank settlement type transactions, and retail customers will never know that bitcoin is involved in their transfers and payments. 
Just using databases for this sort of accounting doesn't work well. Remember how much we all hate banks for being slow and expensive ways of shuffling numbers around? So there is a benefit to using bitcoin for this right?
But they don't actually need a universally open and distributed trustless system. They just need a system that the individual participants can't manipulate. That's entirely possible using a closed "banking blockchain", and there are major benefits to them in using that closed new system rather than tying themselves into bitcoin.

@_date: 2017-02-22 19:05:22
Ok. Here's some proof, which the Core development team have had over 3 years to review and revise as they see fit:
[March 2013 Chain Fork Post-Mortem](
If you check the history on that document you can see that Luke didn't like the term "hard-fork" but didn't dispute that it was indeed a fork. He also didn't try to deny that the miners on the 0.8 side of the fork lost bitcoins when they downgraded and rolled back their chain.
If you can show me some more compelling evidence that people actually disputed this fork prior to the Ethereum hard-fork, that'd be great. Otherwise it seems blatantly obvious that what you're citing is indeed Greg trying to revise history to support whatever argument he currently feels like making.
@_date: 2017-02-21 23:00:33


All of this stuff applies equally if not more so to certain members of the Core team. Luke-jr sat in a room in HK for 18 hours and promised to produce code for a 2MB blocksize hardfork. Then he ultimately delivered a proposal to reduce the blocksize to 300KB and slowly scale it up to 2MB over the next 7 years. I can only imagine the shit-eating grin on his face as he made that commit. Plus it's a miracle that Greg manages to write any code at all with the amount of time he spends trolling rbtc.


No, they don't.


Yes, they do.


Yeah, that's pretty bad. Ideally there would be some other network for testing stuff out to see if it causes problems. Maybe we could call it test-testnet? Or maybe you could grasp what the purpose of testnet is and realise it's exactly the right place to blow stuff up.


Much as the divine Core implementation has done in the past.


Because nothing really *did* happen. It was a single orphaned block for Roger Ver's mining pool. The Core fork back in 2013 lasted what, 16 blocks? The miners who found those blocks "lost" a lot more bitcoins than Roger's pool.


I can never remember, is it liable or slander when written down? Either way you're just flat out spouting bullshit at this point.


And yet like I said, many many of these points apply massively to Greg, Adam, Luke, Peter Todd, basically all the vocal people in and around Bitcoin Core have got into disingenuous shit-slinging over the course of this 2-3 year war on scaling. And you'd clearly still pay good bitcoins for the opportunity to lick their boots.

How does the bitcoin blockchain protect us from each other?
Vibr is trying to paint the hypothetical "banking blockchain" as a single party system. I.e. JPM running the ledger and everyone trusting them. OP is trying to pitch bitcoins blockchain as a massively decentralised system. 
DoctorMidnight is pointing out that an actual "banking blockchain" would be distributed between dozens if not hundreds of participating institutions, each of which is interested in keeping the others honest.
I would like to point out that the reality of contemporary bitcoin mining is probably only decentralised to that same "dozens to hundreds" scale. There may be no single individual with enough hashing power to rewrite the blockchain in their own image. But compromise 3-4, maybe 5 of the right people and the blockchain would be yours.
So if you're running Goldman Sachs or HSBC would you opt to use bitcoin's not particularly distributed blockchain, or a not particulary distributed blockchain designed and operated by your own industry?
@_date: 2017-02-28 19:15:15
Yes, absolutely 100% agree. These are all reasons why the ultimately necessary scaling of the blocksize parameter should have been - and still should be - addressed as soon as possible. 
The Core roadmap insists that it is better to do X, Y, Z, and maybe some extra letters that we haven't come up with, before implementing a hard-fork. But I think that's illogical ordering for anyone who accepts that a hard-fork will be necessary. 
Even if you think it makes sense to activate SegWit, Schnorr signatures, or any other optimisations before increasing the blocksize cap; it *still* makes sense to implement the hard-fork code first. Not activate, but implement. Every subsequently added feature is, or should be, another incentive to upgrade and therefore reduces the risk that people will still be running incompatible software when the fork date/threshold is reached.
It would also mean that the decision paralysis you're talking about shouldn't exist. People shouldn't feel that they have to choose between Core or blocksize scaling. If the Core devs recognise that a blocksize hard-fork is or will be necessary they should put their code where their mouths are and show people that a reasonable scaling hard-fork will take place when certain defined conditions are met. Even if those conditions end up being 95% hash-rate and a 3-month grace period. Right now all people have is words, those words are deliberately vague, and any proposal would likely take another two years to actually make a difference.

If you removed the cap entirely and relied on miners to set their own caps the network would be forked in the arse by the end of the day.

Seems like Gavin [wrote a pretty good break-down]( of this issue two years ago. Cliff-notes being that non-mining nodes don't really need to store the whole UTXO set in memory. 
I've had similar conversations with people here who said that running a node was too expensive because they were storing the whole fricking blockchain on SSD as if that were somehow necessary.
Importantly the only way the blocksize limits UTXO growth is by making Bitcoin harder and more expensive to use. That doesn't seem like a good thing, and if it were there are all sorts of ways we could make Bitcoin less appealing, but we don't.

Coinbase and Bitpay are L2 systems. They aren't decentralised. They aren't the kind of L2 systems that you want. But they are L2 systems. 


An estimate based on what? And what if I disagree with your estimation methodology? We're talking about requirements for a fork to occur here, I can't just accept that "according to rbtkhn's estimation this has sufficient dev support".


It's not though. Public statements are all over the place, frequently open to interpretation, and sometimes conflict with other public statements. You can't use that as a metric for whether a protocol change has support or not.
Their code is also not a direct measure of support. I already explained at least once or twice that wallet devs may implement "support" (in the code sense) for something like SegWit transactions without necessarily "supporting" (in a personal sense) the changes cause by SegWit. Your over/misinterpreting evidence in exactly the way I suggested earlier.


I don't need to convince you that your 95% estimate is wrong, because you haven't provided any evidence for it in the first place. Do you expect people to waste time debunking every random statement you make?
Plus this conversation wasn't even about SegWit, despite you many attempts to make it that way. The question is how to define and measure overwhelming consensus. The answer is that you can't. So if you really want I can reasonably conclude that SegWit doesn't have overwhelming support since it's an impossible to reach concept.

[Right now]( just over 20% of miners are signalling support for an alternative client that directly opposes Core's SegWit soft-fork. The soft-fork requires a 95% super-duper majority to activate according to the rules chosen by the Core devs.
Those same developers have been very vocal lately about the possibility of changing the proof of work if miners start "misbehaving". So any attempt to force through activation with less than Core's specified 95% support by orphaning non-SegWit blocks would undoubtedly cause the devs to take emergency action to prevent such a clearly contentious change from taking place.

It doesn't matter if you agree with them or not, you just have to acknowledge that *from their perspective* there is little to gain from merging thousands of tiny Core commits and it opens a hypothetical attack vector if someone at Core decided to be nefarious and add something they knew would screw with the other implementation.


I totally agree with that part. The rest of your statement is just speculative bullshit.

This is very much a Luke-Jr dogmatic approach to Bitcoin. By this definition Bitcoin only has a few thousand users worldwide. If 0.1% of Bitcoin users are actually validating their transactions and doubling the average blocksize decreases that to 0.08% by pushing some weakly resourced nodes out, is that actually a bad thing? Especially if we greatly increase the total number of users at the same time.
Let's talk about open-source software. People trust open source projects a lot more than closed source projects. That's not because they've personally reviewed the code. There are few if any people in the world who are fluent enough in so many programming languages that they can do a thorough code review on every project they use. Most people don't even review the projects that they theoretically could do. 
We still trust open-source projects because they can be reviewed, because if they're popular and well maintained then we know they *have been* reviewed and are constantly being reviewed by others.
By the same merit I don't stress myself over using a lightweight wallet to transact small sums because I trust the decentralised network of thousands of independent nodes. If I were making large transactions, or many small transactions e.g. as a Bitcoin accepting business then I would certainly want to run my own node(s). Hence why we should want to preserve bitcoins use cases and encourage as much adoption as possible.

I don't know why I'm bothering. You're by far one of the most disingenuous Core attack dogs on this sub, and will say basically anything. But I'm not going to let this part slide:


This is a simple historical fact. Changes between 0.7 and 0.8 meant that miners running 0.8 created a block that 0.7 clients couldn't verify. The chain forked. It absolutely forked. Everyone knows that it forked. 
To fix the fork the 0.8 miners (who had actually kept their software up-to-date) were asked to revert to 0.7 and roll back the blocks they had already mined. They did so at their own expense for the greater good of Bitcoin. Almost no-one bitched and whined and tried to crucify the developer(s) who had inadvertently caused the brief fork. Those were better times.

Did we focus group this one? I didn't get the memo and honestly I don't think it's going to play well.
We were doing Ok with "miners want SegWit but many of them are running custom software and need to do adjustments and testing before signalling". I know it's getting a bit long in the tooth after several months, but it still sounds plausible and is essentially impossible to disprove. 
This new line requires people to believe that a large chunk of miners are postponing signalling until ARBITRARYPROPORTION of nodes are upgraded, even though there is no activation requirement for nodes. I like the arbitrary number part, we can shift it higher as necessary. But the overall logic just doesn't hold up.
So can we roll back to the custom code line at least for another few weeks and try to come up with something better?

This is the dumbest thing I've seen in a while. Speaking as a fan of forking the maxblocksize away and someone who frequents r/btc, I wouldn't never expect Roger Ver to unite the community, or any community. 
Roger is and always has been a controversial and let's say very strongly opinionated person. He spent time in prison for running a mail order explosives business storing his stock in a residential building. Then when released, rather than admit his mistakes, he made a very public show of leaving the US both physically and in citizenship. Throwing off the shackles of a country that imposes crazy laws that stop people endangering their neighbour's lives.
As a leading investor and founder of various businesses he ended up abusing his position at blockchain.info to investigate and publicly attack someone he felt was trying to scam one of his drop-shipping companies.
He also got into a very public months-long fight with a Chinese business partner over the running of and paying for a website. The sort of issue that comes up all the time but is almost always resolved quietly in private.
So Roger is an important figure in Bitcoin and has been for many years. But I don't think any sensible person expected him to unite the community.

Exactly. Gavin has written a number of blog posts on different aspects of this issue and linked to them here. Those are the posts that other developers will pay attention to, and those posts provide plenty of opportunity for people to add their own thoughts (no matter how half-baked) on the subject in the comments.
Yet for each of these focused worthwhile discussions we have 10-20 posts along the lines of "ZOMG, just raise the limit FFS!". We don't need those posts. They add nothing to the discussion, and they fill up the front page with incessant repetitive nothingness.
pizzaface18 posted elsewhere in this thread suggesting that their shouldn't be a limit at all, and miners should set their own limits based on what they individually feel is appropriate.

Yeah, I'll happily deny that. The commit count is just the number of commits made to Core that haven't been merged into BU. 
Some of those commits are just people correcting typos in comments. Some of them are people changing formatting. 
Some are code changes which may have been ported over the old fashioned way because the variable name changes in BU make it difficult to merge in the code through git (yes, I agree the variable names are immature and they created extra hassle for themselves).
When a commit can be anything from the addition of an entirely new module down to the deletion of a single errant line-space; saying "they are 3233 commits behind" is a useless metric. It's just as meaningless as the giant list of not-really-meaningful contributors in OP's post.

I think most of the things listed are more easily overcome than you might think.
The fact that bitcoin is open-source makes it far easier to launch a competitor since all the functionality can be duplicated in a matter of seconds. 
For the same reason the merchants adopting bitcoin, and the companies being backed with VC money, can easily switch from bitcoin to "forkcoin" in no time at all. 
The thing that bitcoin really has going for it is a very large mining network and more users than any altcoin. But the slow bleed of the last year suggests that user adoption has stagnated, and the lowered value is already causing some miners to shut down their equipment, weakening the network. 
I still think bitcoin is by far the best contender for future global cryptocurrency. But pride goes before a fall, and once upon a time MySpace had ten times as many users as any other social network.

People often compare bitcoin to gold. So let's say that over the next few years 95% of the worlds known gold supply is lost in a series of crazy accidents. The remainining 5% could still act as a long-term global store of value just by increasing in value by 20 times. But would it? 
How sure is everyone that the lost gold is really gone? Can you prove that those tons and tons of gold bars are really unrecoverable? What if they aren't lost at all, what if someone is stockpiling huge amounts of gold in secret waiting for the price to reach $200 a gram before selling it off again?
It is entirely possible to lose control of a bitcoin address and render your coins permanently unrecoverable. But it's basically impossible to prove that that has happened.

Hmm, that's a challenging definition. 80-85% of miners is reasonably easy to measure. 80-85% of full nodes is more challenging. 
80-85% of key devs? That's a neatly worded impossible to satisfy condition. Define "key" here? And once we've shortlisted devs that matter according to your definition, how do they signal their views? 
We've repeated seen lists of signatories being misrepresented. Someone signs a document saying they support the Core scaling roadmap, people here say that they clearly reject anything not on that roadmap as dangerous and wrong. A company signals that they are ready to accept SegWit transactions, people here say that "company X wants SegWit"! Possibly true, but not actually what they said.

Today rich people invest their wealth to get a return on investment that outstrips inflation.

As others have noted, the limits protect the companies from fraudulent transactions. But as a side effect they also prevent people from going crazy and throwing huge amounts of money into bitcoin on a whim. If you're a multimillionaire then I can understand your frustration.

I know this is just a facetious comment, but I feel the need to point out that that is exactly the opposite of how central banks work. 
If there were a bitcoin central bank, they would most likely have reduced the block reward early or increased the difficulty to extend average block time. That would reduce the rate of issue of new bitcoins to miners restricting supply. Thus the price would not have fallen as rapidly and the smaller block rewards would have been worth more.

I think we were better off talking in a general sense. Because I find this description to be hugely biased and timelines to be particularly screwy.
Gavin wrote his blog posts precisely because discussions on mailing lists and chat forums had been unproductive and circular. You can see from your own 15 part response here that it's not really possible to resolve these issues one paragraph at a time. Gavin was already frustrated that the same concerns were being brought up over and over in a neat rotation. So he took each point in turn (and invited people to add any he'd missed) and wrote extensive reasonable explorations and explanations of each one. That isn't an affront to the other developers, it's basically a public service.
His reasons for the original 20MB proposal were fairly obvious. Gavin didn't want 20MB blocks. Gavin didn't expect 20MB blocks to suddenly appear as and when the limit was raised. Gavin just didn't want to be planning *another* blocksize hardfork a couple of years after the first one. He knew that with a 20MB cap the miners could continue to softcap actual blocksizes far below that value - if not for the health of the network then surely to maintain some fee pressure. 
Then when concerns started to be voiced ("boo, you suck. 20MB is dumb!") Gavin *did in fact* adjust the proposal according to that feedback. XT dropped the intial proposed cap from 20MB to 8MB as per feedback from other developers and major miners. 
I don't think it's fair to characterise XT or any other open-source alternative implementation as a "fuck you" to the rest of the developers. Unless my own timelines are messed up Gavin still had "maintainer" status on Core at that time. If he'd really wanted to say "fuck you" to his detractors he could presumably have booted Wladimir's access and unilaterally release a version of Core with the changes he wanted?
Instead he and Mike decided to offer the community a choice. If the community had adopted XT it would still be an open source project, so would Classic, so would BU. The developers never get fired, but they do potentially get a wake-up call that there is a huge Bitcoin community who are supposedly in control of Bitcoin. If that community agreed with the highly conservative devs then there would be nothing to worry about. If they backed the alternative proposal put forward by Gavin and Mike then who is to say "that's not Bitcoin anymore because it didn't come from the Core repo"?
Unfortunately we weren't able to see how that question would have played out. Certain individuals took it upon themselves to shape (by which I mean squash) the conversation so that the community wouldn't be aware of the options.
On the topic of Mike: I know, he definitely was a divisive, arrogant, and highly opinionated person. But that's not exactly a rare personality in the Bitcoin space. The exact same could be said about Greg, Luke, Peter Todd. Mike got completely slated for talking about the hypothetical possibility of blacklisting coins known to have been stolen. Meanwhile Peter somehow got replace-by-fee incorporated as a feature! So arrogant jerks proposing unpopular things sometimes works out.

It may just show that they aren't paying that much attention. If I were new to bitcoin, which implementation would I be most likely to run? If I'm the sort of person who keeps their software up-to-date and trusts the developers won't make major changes, which implementation would I be running? 
This is what people refer to when saying Bitcoin Core is the "default" client, and the leading devs on Core do effectively control Bitcoin's development.

If Greg uncovered evidence of an influential reddit account being sold he could have notified the other mods in private. He could have sent his evidence to the reddit admins and let them investigate and take action. 
Instead he chose to make public posts on the topic and from what I can see based on his recent interactions he seems to have deliberately withheld evidence because he wanted to stir the pot/smack the beehive/shit in the punchbowl as much as he possibly could. He wasn't doing "credible work", he was trying to maximise drama. 
So yeah, I think it's reasonable to call that trolling.


I can't be bothered scanning through hundreds of Greg's comments so I'm just going to point out, again, that Greg has to be whitelisted on rbtc because his net karma is substantially negative. If less than 10% of his comments really are downvoted then those &lt;10% must be really fucking shitty comments, mustn't they?

Regardless of the source I think the occasional reality check is a good thing. posts have a tendency to compare bitcoin to the worst, most archaic financial services and then declare that bitcoins superiority is absolute and its success is guaranteed.

Zooming out shows you that there were probably a lot of new users of bitcoin, in 2013. That is not the issue being discussed. Pugwash cited bitcoin's network effects as a reason it will succeed. For that to be true bitcoin needs to continue to attract more users that altcoins. Lack of user growth in 2014 is very relevant to that.

I'd hope that the pool of wikipedia editors is large enough that some of them take a positive view towards bitcoin and crytocurrency in general. 
The key thing is to work within the rules and guidelines of wikipedia. If certain editors are really deleting anything positive no matter how relevant and well referenced it is, then they are putting their reputation on the line and should be brought to the attention of the wikipedia community. 
If however those editors are "cleaning up" after a clearly orchastrated raid from a bunch of newly created accounts, it makes it really easy for them to sweep any solid information out of the way along with all the coindesk fluff.

Interesting. I'd never seen anyone attributing blame for that fork before. Probably in part because everyone seemed to agree that the bug in question was a flaw in the previous releases, not the new code. The decision to fall back to 0.7 was a pragmatic choice to get everyone back on the same chain ASAP, it wasn't a criticism of 0.8.
[The commit]( lists both Mike and Pieter Wuille, so it doesn't seem entirely accurate to blame Mike for forking the network and praise Pieter for rescuing it. 
Plus there's the part about testing and code review being a collective responsibility. I don't think Mike ever had the power to unilaterally push his code changes into a new release?

Or are you referring to something else?

I totally agree. Bitcoin is not bad. I don't think it's bad, and Bill Gates doesn't think it's bad. His actual comment from the AMA was this:


Which is very close to what you just said. All things that are useful will also be useful for "bad guys" who want to do bad things. But certain things seem extra useful for bad stuff compared with their use to the general public. 
Personally I'm a big fan of bitcoin, but I totally see why law-makers would look at a system that let's people easily send money without identifying themselves, and instantly focus on all the bad stuff that enables. The argument that that bad stuff already happens doesn't change the fact that bitcoin will make it all easier.

So "unite the community" by smothering one side of the discussion? If that was an effective strategy it would have worked when Theymos tried it.
Luke Jr offered a compromise by promising explicitly a blocksize hardfork 3 months after SegWit was ready. Saying that SegWit was the blocksize increase is completely dishonest. In fact even Luke isn't that crazy. He continued working on his hardfork code and eventually released the belated trolling proposal that he knew everyone would reject. 
Is that really your idea of solid arguments and compromises? Because it looks to me a lot more like deliberately deceptive practices designed to mislead miners and prevent legitimate competition in this supposedly decentralised system.

By most estimations SegWit will get use the equivalent of ~1.7mb of transaction space *if* it is widely adopted. So by your own maths that only gets us about 6 weeks of growth?

I disagree. The number of daily transactions is extremely easy and cheap to manipulate. Anyone with a significant investment in bitcoin could set up automated churning of their holdings between addresses, and make it look like steady organic growth. 
The thing that genuine new users do, which is very expensive to fake, is buy bitcoins. They have to buy bitcoins in order to become a user. If there were a substantial number of new users buying their first bitcoins last year, why did the price continually tank?
@_date: 2016-01-23 01:11:14


I do, yes.
Raising the cap on the block size does not equal raising the block size. With a higher cap the miners would still be able to use soft caps to keep blocks small/manageable for the network, and they have no real incentive to "fuck things up". Even if the miners didn't use this power we still wouldn't see large blocks until or unless there is multiplicative growth in Bitcoin use.
You're comments are just a weird mix of "Core people seem very smart to me. We should trust and believe whatever they say", with "come at me bro, no one can fault my awesome logic".

What proof do you have that HSBC laundered money for drug cartels and terrorists? 
Note that in answering this question you're going to cite sources showing that US law enforcement *did* in fact investigate and prosecute those crimes. Then you're going to complain that a multi-billion dollar fine is not real punishment because it's a tiny fraction of HSBC's annual turnover and because no individual went to prison. 
Then i'm going to point out that, unlike the silk road, HSBC is a massive global business with *a quarter of a million employees*; so trying to investigate exactly who knew what and who was guilty of what would be incredibly difficult and would most likely end-up with some poor scapegoat anyway. 
Ultimately we're never going to agree on the morality of all this, but the imporant indisputable fact is that the enforcement agencies *did* investigate and prosecute HSBC.

Certain non-bank financial businesses demonstrate that customer funds are ring-fenced in accounts separate to their operational funds. 
The point is to show that although those funds are on deposit with companyX, they do not belong to companyX, and in the event of companyX going bust those funds have to be returned to customers rather than creditors. 
Whether that principle is enforceable without some sort of evil regulation is disputable. But when people clamour for "proof of reserves", they are really asking exchanges to demonstrate that customer funds and christmas party funds are separated.

I don't get why this is being upvoted. Everytime there is a substantial price drop the front page fills up with self-posts from people who don't care about the price, and links like this telling people that since bitcoin didn't die in a previous crash it must therefore be immortal. 
If all these people *really* didn't care about price, and *really* weren't worried about the short-term dips; why bother posting this stuff? 
This post and half a dozen others have hit the front page in the last 24 hours for one simple reason. People are scared. They are trying to reassure each other, and themselves that everything is going to be ok. But if they were actually certain of that, they would switch off bitcoinity, walk away and do something more fun.

But I don't believe that you actually curtail your business plans on the grounds that €100k of increased earnings will only net you €48k.
I also live in a progressive taxation country (UK) and I'm still very happy that my new job puts me in a higher tax band than the old one. I'm still very much going to work hard and push for promotions and raises even though half the extra money will go on taxes.

By the same merit a currency that is designed to allow largely anonymous transactions to and from anywhere in the world with no pesky intermediaries *will be* extremely useful for funding any illegal activity including terrorism.

Yes the Swiss central bank was artificially constraining the value of it's own currency to support Swiss export firms. Because the alternative was to let those export firms collapse and have the entire Swiss economy be based on providing a financial safe-haven for fickle foreign investors. That would have been a bad plan. It would be particularly bad for all those Swiss workers you keep talking about since financial services don't provide a huge number of jobs.

I wouldn't be surprised if you're right when it comes to Maxwell and a couple of others who have clearly nailed their colours to the mast during this whole debate. It would be embarrassing for them to go from leading Bitcoin Core to contributing to Bitcoin Classic. But there are a long list of developers who contribute to Core to some extent, and most of them are probably more interested in making Bitcoin work than making Bitcoin Core work.
As for the rest of what you said, I think your hero worship of the cypherpunk devs is at odds with your anti-state anti-censorship ideals. 
You say that once a precedent is set for bowing down to what the users want Bitcoin will be easy for the state to co-opt, and therefore we should ignore the userbase and trust in the dev team?

Downvotes should ensue. It's complete speculation that doesn't really help anyone. It's also coming from an account that was set-up solely to bad mouth Bitstamp over and over again. 
I understand people criticizing exchanges and drawing attention to questionable practices if their goal is to warn people to get their money out or to not put money in in the first place. But Bitstamp is currently closed for business, so no-one can do those things.

The real answer to your real question is: yes, it would almost certainly have been resolved without this shit-post. 
Most people would wait more than 24 hours or however long OP gave them before posting to Reddit. So it stands to reason that if they just ignored people we would see a lot of posts stating that "Coinbase hasn't responded to my customer support ticket for a week". In reality almost every time I see one of these it's someone jumping the gun because their problem hasn't been resolved in the first 6 hours.

No, I still have to question why you're backing up the guy spreading unsubstantiated lies. Linktype said Jihan controls 99% of the ASIC market. You've backed that down to 75%, but you still haven't provided anymore evidence than he did.
If Jihan is such an outspoken critic of the Core developers why would he even bother with cloak and dagger stuff? Why is his own actual pool mining on Core? 
Either Jihan is some evil James Bond villian mastermind who is somehow so inept that people like you and linktype are able to uncover his nefarious plan... Or maybe just maybe this is all crap.

Collapsed comments are collapsed, not hidden. I actively collapse lots of comments when going through a large multi-threaded discussion, but those posts don't disappear. 
Anyone who thinks r/bitcoin's CSS is bad probably wants their reddit account settings to work as intended. The threshold at which downvoted comments are collapsed is a user configurable setting. Theymos screwed around with the CSS to override that setting and in the process he made it impossible to collapse comments even after you'd read them. I don't know if those problems are still in place because I had to disable this sub's theme to make it usable. 
Even without the custom theme I still regularly have to spot the threads where you or other mods have changed the recommended sort order of comments to ensure that things you agree with are more prominent. Most subs that do that make a universal &amp; consistent change (e.g. r/bitcoinmarkets daily thread is always set to newest first). This is the only sub I've ever seen shuffling sort orders on a post by post basis depending on what gets written and up/downvoted. 
So yeah, the argument that this is all just good moderation practices rather than active (and presumably quite high maintainence) content manipulation just isn't very convincing.

You can only check and confirm the same things I can check. If I really wanted to claim lost ownership of some coins I've never actually touched I can research the preceding transactions before I claim them.
But none of that matters because, like I said, I can claim to have lost coins I actually still own. You can't possible disprove me until I eventually spend them.

I want to assert that the OP jumped the gun on his social media exposure. 
As I've now said about three times I would be interested to see posts saying "Coinbase has ignored my ticket for a week, WTF?!". But we don't see those posts because Coinbase does deal with support in a sensible timeframe.
Look back at OP's timeline. The problem withdrawal was on Monday night way after business hours, so effectively Tuesday. His other withdrawals took 2 days to go through. So, although the missing confirmation email may have peturbed him, his money wasn't really missing until Thursday. On Friday (and a holiday in many parts) he posts to Reddit.
So how long do you think Coinbase was "unresponsive" for?
Besides all that the fact that this post is sitting at the top of the sub with thousands of up votes long after being resolved tells you something. Whatever OPs intentions were, some people around here will leap on any opportunity to shit all over Coinbase because Brian Armstrong has spoken out in favour of a blocksize hardfork. That's why we're here, it's got fuck all to do with a 24 hour unresolved support ticket.

But several of the lead developers on Core have spent months nailing their boots to the ground and now they are physically incapable of backing down.
@_date: 2015-05-22 20:36:17


This right here is one of the most repeated and misguided criticisms of the "blockchain without bitcoin" ideas. 100 independent banks/businesses is not a small number of miners. If it were then bitcoin is already fucked. The majority of the massive bitcoin hashing power is in the hands of far fewer than 100 people, and unless a major change occurs it probably always will be.
But that's actually not that bad. If we had 100 roughly equally powered mining operations the chances of a long chain of blocks being mined by one operation would be miniscule. That is what the banking blockchain would end up looking like.
As for the public auditing; how on earth is that beneficial for the banks? To balance the interbank transfer books they only need to prevent each other from making mistakes or committing fraud. It actually doesn't really have anything to do with us on an individual basis.

No. It would be a hardfork to adjust a hard coded limitation that (almost) everyone agrees will at some point need to be adjusted.


No. As soon as we can safely deploy it, we should. Hardforks get more difficult the bigger the Bitcoin ecosystem becomes. Avoiding it for the next two years could mean coordinating the upgrade across ten times as many people/businesses/third party software developers.


Yes, we do. Deliberately constraining the network will force lower value transaction use cases off the Bitcoin network. None of the proposed second layer solutions are actually deployed yet, so there is a real danger of pushing a long standing part of the Bitcoin economy onto an alt-coin.


No. Actual spam transactions can be filtered out by the miners themselves. We don't need to police what is and isn't considered a "real" transaction at the protocol level.


I disagree with the argument that if your solution isn't permanent and perfect there's no point doing anything. But I agree that it would be better to implement a progressively increasing cap rather than a new fixed limit. It would be relatively easy for the core devs to implement their own version of bip101 with whatever scaling schedule and trigger parameters they felt were safe.

Your economic theory is missing a crucial component, that being the actual economy. 
You're relying on the idea that at a certain point a negative feedback loop will occur and people will start spending more of their saved funds and things will level out to normal. The problem is that in the intervening years of recession many businesses will go bust and many people will lose their jobs. It's tough to save money when you don't have any.
So the feedback loop may take a long time to kick in, or it may not kick in at all.

But that's the thing about brigading. If theredpill community attacks shitredditsays for example; that's brigading. You're acknowledging that the people supposedly vote brigading this subreddit are previously active members of the sub who were forced out when theymos decided to ban discussion of XT. 
I don't have anything against people churning account occasionally if they care about their privacy. But I do think it's highly suspicious that those accounts I mentioned - and a number more - popped up just as the XT turmoil was happening and immediately went from zero to 30 comments a day.
I suspect that if we plotted average number of comments per front page submission over the last year, then filtered out accounts made in the last year, there would be a much more noticeable drop off when theymos went all dictatory. It just wasn't so noticeable because of the huge volume of padding those new account added. But all of that is pure speculation because I'm way too lazy to attempt that analysis.
@_date: 2017-02-20 07:49:23
Yes, undoubtedly. We can all agree that this is a ridiculously unhelpful metric. 
But for some reason when OP posted it you didn't respond by saying "this is a ridiculously unhelpful metric and many of the contributors are simply editing typos in comment lines or adding lists of companies that support SegWit".
Your [first comment]( supported someone's prediction that BU will now boost their number through "sock-puppet" contributors (without acknowledging that many names on the right hand side were not active developers).
Your [second comment]( reinforced the idea that these are actually 100-ish meaningful contributors, which you clearly know to be false.
And your [third comment]( went ahead and introduced a new critical metric that BU is 3233 commits behind Core. But since you have also commented about BU changing variables and restructuring the codebase to the point where they can't easily merge Core code you must also know that this is another pointless misleading metric.

You read his blog post. You must know this is an inaccurate characterisation of what he said.
If XT/bip101 had been offered to the community as an option and had failed to gain traction because the community didn't want bigger blocks, that would be one thing. 
But it *was* gaining traction. Nodes were switching, major Bitcoin businesses were stating their support, and at least one mining pool was giving its miners the option to vote for XT. 
All the things that would be required for "broad economic consensus" and a smooth change over were starting to happen. So theymos, and a small group of other bitcoiners, decided to prevent it by any means necessary even if it was what the Bitcoin community wanted. 
Everyone, even those who want to retain the 1mb cap, should be angry and concerned about the actions of theymos and whomever launched the attacks against XT nodes/slush's pool/coinbase. So it's really not surprising that Mike would be pissed off.

But looking around my place there's tons of stuff I could buy from individuals (clothes, furniture) but I never would because economies of scale make companies vastly more efficient at producing that stuff.

I think it's fair to say that a hardfork to change the PoW would be somewhat "contentious". So it's reasonable to assume that there really would be two forks, one with all the existing hash-power of the Bitcoin network, one that could instantly be attacked by anyone in control of a decent sized botnet. 
The only way a PoW changing fork could "safely" work with Bitcoin is if people prepped a sizeable amount of carefully optimised hashpower for the new PoW algorithm in advance.

It seems to me that using multi-sig addresses on exchanges only works for funds that aren't in open orders. Once you open a sell order the exchange needs to be able to transfer your coins to the buyer as and when the order is met, and they wouldn't want to wait for your permission to complete the transaction. 
So all in all it only protects coins that are on deposit but not being traded, and those don't really benefit the exchange.

They don't fork the blockchain until or unless they are adopted by a super majority of miners. Miners have no incentive to force a hardfork unless it is widely supported by exchanges and node operators.

I think the juxtaposition of those two parts is important. You weren't reading much about XT because theymos started deleting almost any thread about it (except the occasional critical posts that happened to slip past his filter). 
You didn't think it was gaining traction - because you weren't hearing anything about it - because theymos was deleting the posts. He convinced you it was a massively unpopular and potentially dangerous solution, and that the Core team would solve the blocksize problem soon.
But you don't think miners were influenced in the same way you were? They are people just like you and me. They get their news and discussions from the same sources and they base their decisions on the information available to them.
I can't blame Mike for leaving. Nor do I blame him for working with banks. I think he is genuinely interested in making global financial services more efficient (i.e. cheaper) and more trust less. Bitcoin was aimed at doing that, but it isn't anymore. It's been co-opted and shoved into a tiny little box and we're all being told that Bitcoin is so important that it can't ever come out of that box. 
That's why Mike left. He wanted to take Bitcoin out of the box and make it the worldwide system it was designed to be. He tried, a small cabal of people prevented him from doing it. Now he's going to try something different with roughly the same ultimate goal.

In the event that both forks continue for a period things might get pretty nasty. The old fork would have less than 25% of its former hash rate and that figure would probably drop as further miners defected. 
Things could then get nasty as people want resolution and one-true-Bitcoin. The Core network would be wide open to potential attacks from the big mining pools that support Classic. 
Changing the POW would detach Core from the Bitcoin mining network all together. It could still be vulnerable to botnet attacks, but not to the massive infrastructure that would support Classic in this hypothetical scenario.
It still seems like it would be a futile excercise at that point.

If the detailed technical arguments put forward countless times by core are so compelling and indisputable, why do you think Gavin or Mike or Jeff Garzik are still pushing for an increase? 
Do you believe that some of the longest standing developers in Bitcoin are too simple minded to understand? Or do you think that maybe the arguments put forward by the core team aren't actually that convincing?
I've heard the arguments about node centralisation and miner centralisation. But they all rely on the false equivalency that an 8Mb cap means 8Mb blocks, while no other variables would change. 
If usage of Bitcoin went up 8 fold (or even more if you factor in SegWit) there would be far more people using the network, thus far more people and businesses running nodes. That vastly bigger more active network would most certainly translate into much higher prices and therefore greater incentive for investment in mining.
All of those blatantly obvious elements are ignored in the arguments presented. That's why those arguments have failed to convince anyone that wasn't already on Bitcoin Core's "side".

Bank transfers and cheques in the UK used to take several working days. The money wasn't earning interest in the payer's account and it wasn't earning interest in the payee's account. It was just interest free capital for one of the two banks.

Besides Mark Karpeles trying to use transaction malleability as a cover for carelessly losing $800 million I've only ever seen it come up once. 
Just a couple of weeks ago, Greg Maxwell made a huge show of the fact that deliberately malleated transactions had been included in a block and that had temporarily inconvenienced some people in some way that he didn't really want to go into in any detail.
Anyone with any common sense knows that someone desperate to get SegWit activated initiated that "attack" because no-one else really has anything to gain from it.

So are Core in control or not? That's the question I asked. 
For some reason you're talking about the mining corporation (Bitmain I assume?) selecting who they sell mining rigs to. This isn't true. It's very popular propaganda on this subreddit. But Bitmain have a public facing webshop where anyone who wants to buy an ant-miner can buy one. I've also never seen any actual evidence or even unfounded accusations that they refused to sell miners to people supporting Core, or SegWit.

Theymos deleting comments and banning commenters makes them and their opinions on the issue invisible to the community. Very effective censorship of a particular idea or point of view.
"Downvote attacks" make comments collapse at the bottom of the thread, meaning anyone can still expand and view those comments. Pretty ineffective way of censoring a particular idea or point of view.
Theymos deleting comments and banning posters for talking about XT is something he openly and proudly admits to doing.

That sounds like a fair and rational position. But it's explicitly not the position theymos took. He didn't make any pretence about just removing duplicates or wanting to keep the front page varied and interesting. He made up a new definition of altcoin, created a vague nebulous requirement for "consensus", and then started nuking any post or comment that mentioned or seemed to reference XT. 
The fact that you see more of these comments now is because - when it comes to XT - he has achieved what he set out too. He prevented enough of the community from hearing/talking about it for a long enough period that momentum died out.

Default means the oldest client that is run by the most nodes. It obviously makes sense for any developers who don't feel really strongly about the situation to continue contributing their code to Core. 
It also makes sense for users who don't feel strongly to use the "main" Bitcoin client with the longest history and most developers working on it. Kind of a positive feedback loop when you think about it, huh? You could call it a network effect, or inertia, but basically it doesn't mean "best".
I'm not going to look up BU contributions for you. You can do that yourself since it's an open source repository.
I also can't name Core contributors who have stated they would follow the network to an alternative client. Mostly because I don't avidly follow all of those people and everything they've said. But also because we know they'd be fucking crucified by this community if they actually stated that out-loud.

This isn't scrutiny, this is just you saying stuff.
By what measure do you find Blockstream employee's arguments to be consistent with the views expressed before the company was founded? Are you text-mining Twitter feeds and forum comments from the last 5 years?
By what measure are you counting Core developers? Is it anyone who commits a typo correction in a comment line? Or only people who have made X number of commits covering Y lines of code? Without knowing your definition it's hard to be specific. But even without that definition I don't think I've heard the views of most Core developers. I've heard the views of Blockstream employed Core developers over and over and over again. 
I just want to check that you do know the guy posting these tweets is Blockstream's "communications officer", I didn't make that but up. 
If you check his [reddit post history]( and the rest of his Twitter feed you'll see that he spends about half his working day trolling rbtc and anyone who disagrees with Gregory Maxwell's Core scaling roadmap.

I was making the point that -Hayo-'s definition of a non-contentious hardfork sounds nice, but is literally impossible. 
Some users will always fail to adopt a hardfork, even if it's just through negligence. But it's pretty much impossible to tell the difference between a node that is running 4 year old software because they are too lazy to upgrade, and one that is running 4 year old software because of their strong feelings about some soft-forked feature.

@_date: 2017-02-22 21:49:21


Possible, but there's a valid point of contention as to whether they *have to* scale better. 
I don't subscribe to the view that every user needs to run a full node (and neither do 99% of users based on node counts). 
I don't think it makes any sense to force a fee market now when the block reward seems designed to subsidise mining for decades to come. 
I honestly think the healthiest thing for Bitcoin is to ensure that the network (users, businesses, use-cases) can continue to grow with *or without* second layer scaling solutions. 
If Bitcoin didn't currently have the 1MB limit and Luke or Greg or Adam were trying to convince us that we needed to put one in, would you buy it? I don't think many people would. We'd say that crappy underpowered nodes aren't important, and that maintaining Bitcoin's growth *is*.

I wasn't launching some attack on Bitcoin with my comment. My criticism is of people with clear cognitive dissonance defending the deteriorating state of the network.
Bitcoin with an average 10 minute confirmation time is faster than any retail banking transfer. When people start referring to 2 hour confirmation times as "nothing to see here"; that's crap.
People used to pitch Bitcoin transactions as cheap by comparing fees of less than a penny against alleged 3% merchant fees for credit card transactions. Now I see people saying that even if/when Bitcoin transactions cost a dollar or two they will still use it because reasons.
I honestly don't know if my bank transfers are theoretically reversible or not because, you know what, I've literally never tried to reverse a tranfer or had someone else reverse a transfer that they made to me. I don't know anyone in the real world who has ever talked about someone screwing them over with reversible transactions - not even eBay sellers dealing with PayPal.
If you expect new users to keep joining Bitcoin for the irreversibility feature despite transactions becoming increasingly slow and/or expensive then you're kidding yourself. People don't care about solving a problem they have never ever experienced.
@_date: 2017-03-15 22:47:08
So just to clarify; when Bitcoin Core/QT 0.8 caused the network to fork in two your proposed solution would be to take the whole network offline for a while to work out what went wrong, write a new release, have it thoroughly reviewed and tested, then relaunch Bitcoin a few weeks later?
You're presenting a massive double standard. Bitcoin *has* had bugs in the past. Bitcoin will almost certainly have more bugs in the future. As a 20 year veteran of computer engineering how many widely used bug-free pieces of software can you name?
Bugs get identified and - if they're damaging/exploitable like this one - get fixed as-soon-as-fucking-possible. You can certainly tell me that this was an easy bug that should have been caught (everything is easy in hindsight), but you can't tell me that Core or any other development team would have taken their software offline for a lengthy period of time. That's just what you *want* them to do because deep down you're a tad concerned that a third of the hashrate is now signalling for BU.

So he's just consistently bad at data visualisation?
@_date: 2017-03-04 22:11:27
I'm not saying he couldn't block it just with his own pool. That's how the Core team designed the signalling to work. 
I'm saying that people are blaming Jihan for the 70-75% of the mining network that isn't currently signalling for SegWit. If he, or any other individual, were actually in control of that much hashrate, *and* if they wanted a hardfork to happen it would have happened already, wouldn't it?
@_date: 2016-01-27 22:16:08
I'm well aware of the order of events outlined in the roadmap. The point I made was that the roadmap is deliberately vague about when a block size increase will happen. 
I understand that the Core devs may be reluctant to put a date out there because they think it would look bad to set a "deadline" and then potentially miss it. But the current situation has seen them lose a lot of trust in the community. People have pointed to potential conflicts of interest. They have suggested that some of the devs simply don't want to move the cap.
Refusing to set a date feeds into these suggestions, it could be months, it could be years. Vague references to a future hardfork looks like a delaying tactic.
As for the Adam Back post; I read it, including the start of the conversation that the OP trimmed off. I don't think Adam was acting in good faith. 
Jonathan had already stated that he couldn't stay long or get into an indepth discussion. Adam tried to push the conversation first onto SegWit, then the roadmap, and then pretty much the philosophy of open-source software development. 
Consider a couple of Adam's comments:




Core has 50 active developers because Core is the version of Bitcoin people currently use. Adam is acting as if those 50 developers are a company or his employees. They (mostly) aren't. 
If Classic - or any other forked implementation - were to take over, some/many/most of those 50 people would either demand that Core pull in the new block size rules so that their work remains relevant, or they would start developing Classic instead. They wouldn't want to waste their time working on a codebase that no-one is using.
Adam also continued addressing several comments to Jonathan for a couple of minutes after he'd clearly left. Were those comments intended to make Jonathan understand? Or was he simply playing up for the audience?
@_date: 2017-03-12 13:22:33


Your "whole economy" list has 108 companies. Only 53 of whom actually implemented SegWit. The rest just want BTCdrak to stop hassling them. So I'm curious what conservative formula you applied to get from those 53 companies to 95% of the Bitcoin economy?


Node counts don't count. If nodes did count then node-counters only show [61% supporting post-SegWit versions of Core]( And I somewhat trust the neutrality of 21.co more than Luke-jr. 
But it still doesn't matter because nodes don't count. Any node count shows that, at most, a fraction of a percent of Bitcoin users actually run a visible node. People who are running nodes can very easily run many nodes. So whether there are 5,000 or 50,000 SegWit nodes that probably only represents the views of a few hundred people.


If you convince yourself that any pool supporting BU must be a puppet set-up by Jihan then you can get it down to two and a half pools. Unless you also think that Roger Ver's pool belongs to Jihan, and that Slush has been partially corrupted by Jihan's megolomaniac policies?
Or we could acknowledge that as of today roughly a third of the mining network is [actively signalling for BU]( while [SegWit support]( has been stuck at around 25% for three straight months.
@_date: 2017-03-12 12:49:03
Aren't examples of prominent devs changing their minds a bad road to head down?
Didn't Peter Todd once suggest that the best way to control/destroy Bitcoin would be to implement a series of softforks? Now he seems very much in favour of Core releasing upgrades via a series of softforks and is even entertaining the idea of changing the softfork activation rules to force them against miners wishes.
Didn't Greg Maxwell once say that he had mathematically proven that Bitcoin could never work? Now he often seems to be treated as the unofficial lead developer... On a project he publicly stated would fail...
@_date: 2017-03-21 00:10:44


I'm not saying they owe us. I'm saying they should want Bitcoin to succeed, right? Fracturing the community and soon the chain in two does not seem like a smart way of helping Bitcoin succeed. Doing something that would likely prevent a contentious fork and reunite at least a large part of the community *does* seem like it would help Bitcoin succeed. So if it's just a question of reordering events a little to achieve harmony and good vibes for all, why the fuck wouldn't they?


And that's all I'm suggesting they do. We keep seeing this discussion:
User: Core should implement a blocksize hardfork and resolve this situation.
Core (usually Maxwell): Core can't force a hardfork, we can only write code. It's up to users if they want to run it.
User: so... Are you going to write the code
Maxwell: [...](


Unless the BU fork activates, right? Then a hardfork to reset difficulty and/or change the PoW will suddenly be safely deployed in a matter of days.
Plus if a hardfork rollout requires at least a year, why put it last on the roadmap? Seriously, if you only address one thing I've just said, explain the logic behind that? "A hardfork will take at least a year to rollout, therefore we should do shit loads of other stuff before we even think about starting the clock on that process". This makes sense to you?

Just in case anyone didn't click past the title:


If I recall correctly the Core roadmap cites the inevitable need for a cap increase hardfork at some ill defined point in the future. Clearly lots of people, including Aaron Voisine, are sceptical about the lack of any specific details about when/if Core would get around to that.
I think they could quell a lot of the debate if they just put a realistic date on when they plan to raise the cap, and they could scupper any real chance of a "contentious hardfork" if they add their own much more conservative version of bip101 to the code with a delayed activation date.
@_date: 2017-03-04 20:57:30
If Jihan-Wu has so much control over the other miners that he can unilaterally block SegWit activation; why hasn't he used that same control to force a hardfork already? People keep trying scapegoat him but your accusations aren't even internally consistent.

Historically miners had soft-caps in place that limited blocks to 750KB. When that threshold was consistently reached they raised their caps to the hard limit of 1MB. Why do that? 
By your rationale the miners should be using that soft-cap ability now to constrict blocksize further and force fees higher. But they don't.

You - and every other Core fan-boi - would be slating them for not being able to fix a simple bug. 
You'd be talking about how "the Bitcoin network can't just shut down for a few days". 
Peter Todd would likely post his own fix for the bug in a single tweet to show just how easy it was, then you'd spend the next 6 months talking about how "BU devs can't even fix their own bugs without Core devs help".

Ok, you want a real answer. 
I think Bitcoin has the potential to be a really important protocol. I also think it has the potential to be the prototype for something else that goes on to be a really important protocol.
The bigger Bitcoin gets (in terms of users, businesses etc) the harder it is to change anything about it, and that's mostly a good thing. But if you believe that there is anything about the protocol that is going to need to change *at some point*, then the longer that change is put off the harder it becomes to make, right?
Apparently almost everyone acknowledges that the blocksize will have to increase at some point. 1MB of block space, or 1MB + some SegWit creative accounting, or 1MB + SegWit + Lightning network payment channels is *still* not going to be able to support anything close to global payments. So the blocksize limit *will* have to change at some point, right?
Jeff Garzik wanted to address this issue back in 2010 when the network was tiny, blocksize wasn't any kind of issue, and it would have been incredibly easy to deploy a change.
Gavin wanted to address this issue back in 2015 when the network had already grown substantially, the block limit still hadn't been reached, and there was still time to roll out a change with a long activation period.
Many people want to address this issue now because the network has grown very large, blocks are consistently full, and Bitcoin will likely go through some serious growing pains in the time it takes to deploy a long term solution to blocksize scaling.
Some people want to push back *the beginning* of a roll-out/signalling period for blocksize scaling until some undetermined point after various other things they want to implement. Likely years from now. And just to reiterate: the bigger the network gets the harder it is to make *any* change.
So say SegWit allows the bitcoin network to grow to twice its current size. The Lightning Network lets it grow to ten times *that* size. Now some Core developers decide it's finally time to address the blocksize limitation. But uh-oh, the network is now twenty times is current size, the ecosystem is valued in the hundreds of billions of dollars. How exactly do we deploy a change to the consensus rules at *that* point?
So I figure you believe one of the following:
* 1MB is actually fine. A hundred years from now, when the block reward has almost completely disappeared, capping blocks at 1MB will still seem sensible and prudent and our great-grandchildren will appreciate how little storage space the neural blockchain implant requires.
* The blocksize will have to be increased at some point. The Core devs understand that, but for some reason they can't see that it keeps getting harder and harder the longer they delay it. Nor can they see that deploying other scaling solutions like SegWit/Lightning first will make it way *way* harder to deploy a hardfork in the future.
* The blocksize will have to be increased at some point. The Core devs understand that. They also understand that it keeps getting harder the longer they delay, and that things like SegWit and Lightning will make it harder too. But they still want to put off the blocksize issue anyway, for reasons?

I may have misjudged you, but i'd been coming to this subreddit daily since early 2013 and had come to recognise a lot of the prolific posters and commenters. Then a rule change happened and quickly there was a whole new set of prolific commenters, who just so happened to agree with and support everything Theymos says. 
Of course it's possible that Core supporters would become more active in response to attempted forks. But it's also possible that some of the people who are convinced that we're under constant psi-ops attacks would try to use the same tactics to control the narrative.

No. Just no. It absolutely is not defined by that and no-one in their right mind has *ever* used this as a definition of what "Bitcoin" is.

Yes, exactly. Intentional malicious behaviour designed to disrupt and/or prevent a contraversial change to Bitcoin that they don't agree with. Much like if a minority of the community deliberately caused a persistent hard-fork after a blocksize increase. 
I understand that one requires minimal active effort and the other technically just requires negligence. But the risks are basically the same. So if you're going to accept those risks to jam through a SegWit softfork in the worst way possible; why not just go the hardfork route that others have been pushing for for years.

They are stating that they:


That doesn't mean:


That impressive list of developers want to work on Bitcoin. Only a small handful of them are stubborn and arrogant enough to continue working on their ideal version of Bitcoin while the users, miners, exchanges and businesses fork away.

Forking the implementation and offering people the option to switch to use it if they agree with the changes. There is no way that can be considered coercion.

Maximum blocksize cap. This is *the* parameter that is being "handed over" to the miners under BU. 
By fudging the discussion to talk about "consensus parameters" you are attempting to spread fear that the miners - or indeed the Chinese government - might be able to unilaterally change things like the 21million coin cap, or the halving schedule, or... who knows what else they could do, right!?
But no. The miners would have no more or less ability to do any of that stuff after a BU fork than they do right now.
@_date: 2017-03-20 23:03:07
Waiting years (and repeatedly changing fork activation mechanisms to force things through) seems like a really bad idea when we have already hit a very solid wall on transaction throughput.
If Core wants to break the deadlock and get the whole Bitcoin community working together in happiness and euphoric peace, maybe they should work on Greg's flexcap proposal *now*, get it implemented to the point where users and miners can signal their support and activate it, *then* work on Schnorr signatures and all the other things on their backlog while the activation happens (or doesn't if the community firmly rejects the proposal).
@_date: 2017-03-14 19:44:17


And expose ourselves to endless deadlock? Nope, we need something better that will actually get activated, like a conservatively progressive blocksize scaling along with SegWit.

Why do you keep saying 90%? Where are you getting that number from?

If Gavin had made no efforts to discuss the topic prior to his blog-posts; how did he come up with his lengthy list of theoretical issues to write about?
Gavin made the posts because mailing lists and discussion forums tend not to be a great place to lay out a well explained argument. The posts he made would look like massive walls of text in the wrong setting.
Plus, having the blog post series in one place made it easier for people to find the relevant discussions of other topics while reading about one. I.e. It avoided the situation where he spent a bunch of time and effort discussing why X wasn't really a big concern without detractors being able to say "Well that doesn't matter because the *real* issue is Y!"

And that's the problem. Your definition of "a large majority firmly stands behind a decision" is equally impossible, or entirely reachable, depending on how you chose to define "a large majority" or the firmness of their support.
This is why hashrate signalling has been used, both for Core's softforks and for hardfork proposals. It's empirically measurable, very expensive to fake, and the miners are expected to do what they believe will make their current and future bitcoins more valuable.
@_date: 2016-01-23 11:37:45






Maybe it's just your sign offs that need some work. But you are precisely the issue Eric was trying to raise with this post. Actual communication from the Core developers is scarce, and rarely accompanied by any clear data to support their position.
You say yourself that you think there is some evidence from Core that 3Mb blocks might be dangerous. But you don't know where to find that evidence, so you're just going to parrot it back at people without actually knowing what was presented or how compelling it was.
You also completely ignored my point. The devs can only raise the blocksize cap. Miners would have to change their configurations, and usage would have to blow up before we got anywhere near 3Mb.
@_date: 2017-03-20 07:55:05
The BU argument is that there should be multiple implementations maintained by different development groups. They simply don't think any of those groups should be in control of when or if the maxblocksize limit is allowed to increase.
Making Core compatible with the post-fork coin would be trivial for such a talented group of developers, right? And then they could implement whatever features and optimisations they desire. They just couldn't cap the blocksize to force a fee-market.

What doesn't make sense is this:
According to this comment you apparently have multiple servers with hundreds of GB of SSD space. So you clearly put a lot of time, effort, and resources into your computing needs.
Despite what you may have heard it's still entirely possibly to run a Bitcoin full node on a rasberry-pi connected to a $50 hard drive. 
Now you're going to tell me that you don't want to buy a rasberry-pi and a $50 hard drive, you want to use one of the multiple high-spec hosted servers you already run.
But I'm going to say what any rational person would say: Why? Why do you think you need to run a full node if you aren't doing substantial business with Bitcoin? Why do you need to store the entire blockchain rather than a pruned version? And why oh why are you willing to spend who knows how much renting multiple SSD backed servers, but not set up the much cheaper resource required to run a node?
None of this makes sense.

Your own link points out that nice counters only show reachable nodes. There are full nodes that can't be counted by this method. Your tweet link alludes to how easy it is to game this count. So you clearly acknowledge that this method can't distinguish between 200 users and one user running 200 nodes on the same piece of hardware sitting in their datacenter. You say "some of them are fake, but not most." Yet you clearly have no way of knowing.
Your key dev-definition is still conveniently vague. Most/best work is completely subjective. 
The wallets implement SegWit support because it makes sense to prepare for something you expect to be implemented. That doesn't mean you *like* the solution, just that you are prepared for it.
Then there are the L2 scaling solutions. Are Coinbase/Bitpay L2 systems? I mean they definitely are, but I'll bet they don't fit your definition, so you can conveniently ignore their views on any given topic.


I agree.


Based on what? We just agreed that it's impossible to measure.


Sure. But you just made it up. You just literally said this can't be accurately measured, then made up an estimate based on little or no real evidence, then declared it to be overwhelming consensus!

This ever changing concept of consensus is just a stalling technique. If miners support a fork you point at node operators. Nodes start running forked implementations and you point to "the economic majority", whatever the hell that is supposed to mean.

I'm fairly certain he's not serious but you can see what he's getting at. 
Yesterday this sub was all over the fact that a few hundred BU nodes seemed to have been patched and restarted within a few hours of the attack - therefore must be fake. 
Yet 12,600 Core nodes upgrading within the first week of release is totally organic?
It's just the latest round of perpetual double-standards and propaganda. And yes, I definitely know that both sides are playing the same games.
Also, everytime Luke puts out new versions of his extra special custom node counts the numbers seem to have multiplied. I thought we were worried about how few people are running full nodes?

If a conflict arises between a userbase of say a million people and a half dozen lead developers; is it easier for the developers to replace the userbase or for the userbase to find a handful of new devs?
In this case we're not even talking about just finding new devs. Gavin and Jeff are two of the longest standing devs in Bitcoin.
Plus I want to point out that the long list of people who signed the Core roadmap were effectively stating that they considered it an acceptable solution. That's not the same as saying they reject any immediate increase in the cap. So I wouldn't be surprised to see a number of the Core contributors switching to work of Classic if the fork actually happens.

It's weird how they used to be necessary to activate it safely. And not just some of them, but a nearly completely unanimous signalling was required. But now it's that's for some reason not necessary anymore, because that didn't happen.
It almost looks like - and it can't be this, because that would be crazy and inconsistent - but it *looks like* the goalposts have shifted massively such that whatever needs to happen for Blockstream to get SegWit, so they can release Lightning network from their commercial company, is deemed to be a safe and cautious way to upgrade Bitcoin.

Here's why it's a problem.
Say I'm using Bitcoin to pay back a friend of mine $10 I owe them. I low-ball the fee and the transaction sits unconfirmed. I tell them not to worry, it'll get into a block eventually and if it doesn't I'll resend it in 3 days when it drops out of the mempool. 
So now I both have and haven't payed back my friend. *Plus* if the transaction does confirm they now have $10 that they can only spend of or cash-out if they're willing to pay their own $0.50 fee. *Double plus* if fees keeping going higher and higher my friend may end up with a Bitcoin balance that's almost useless since it'll cost them so much to move/spend.

By my count at least four things have to happen for big blocks to actually cause the problems you are suggesting.
1. A hard fork changing the cap (not the block size, just the maximum limit on the block size) to increase.
2. Miners would have to configure their own nodes to produce large blocks. They have always had the power to impose their own limit below the block size cap. So the argument that miners might not want big blocks is entirely redundant.
3. Network traffic would have to increase to the point of actually filling those big blocks. Unless there is some tremendous spike in adoption there's no reason to think actual block sizes would get anywhere near 8MB in the next few years.
4. Technology and infrastructure (including the great firewall) would have to remain static over the time period taken for that transaction rate increase to occur. 
I've spent years hearing about how Bitcoin is an unstoppable honey badger and that no government or banking cabal can stand in its way. Now we're supposed to accept that Bitcoin has to fit in with the limitations of the Chinese firewall and Luke Junior's shitty rural Internet connection? I don't buy it.

Even the messy numbers and charts I saw posted by people here seemed to suggest the BU nodes came back online over the course of a day. If you have clearer evidence that they all popped up in the space of an hour, show it.
And no, it still doesn't look any more or less suspicious from either camp. BU was literally under attack and those nodes had to be updated and restarted in order to work. Every forum (including this I one, thanks Theymos) was flooded with posts about the attack, it was all over Twitter. Basically I'm saying it wasn't that hard for people who ran BU nodes to know they had to go restart them.
By contrast the Core 0.14 release is something Core nodes should probably get around to upgrading to, at some point, when they have time, and maybe after it's been used by others for a while just to really check for unexpected bugs. That's how normal people approach normal software updates.

Proof of block space sounds like it would be an odd one to use if you're already worried that miners are manipulating things. What's to stop each mining pool from selecting the transactions that vote the way they want?
I've never understood people clammering for proof of stake either. How many of the world's current problems are caused because very rich people have massively more influence over things than us great unwashed masses? And in this case we'd have exchanges voting with other people's bitcoins. 
Maybe people should consider that the existing activation mechanism isn't suddenly broken just because a Core implemented feature hasn't been activated.
@_date: 2017-03-04 14:10:06
I understand the semantics, I'm pointing out the irony.
Hardforks have long been characterised as dangerous because if they don't have near complete consensus a fork could occur (though would likely be anemic and short lived). 
So it was proposed to implement SegWit as a softfork whereby non-upgrading nodes wouldn't matter. It was still deemed sensible to require a 95% miner signalling threshold.
Now the miners have chosen not to signal SegWit (so have roughly half the visible nodes btw but that number is less reliable), so *now* we get a proposed new-new way forward wherein only users who agree with the feature count. 
There is no miner consensus, no node consensus, and I've heard very little about requiring any poorly defined "economic majority consensus". *And* the proposal requires that people who don't agree with it still play nicely for the greater good of Bitcoin, right? 
So, remind me why hardforks are dangerous and this isn't?

Any fork will only occur when a large majority of miners support it. Miners will not support a fork unless they are convinced that a significant proportion of nodes will continue to relay their blocks. Ergo no fork will happen unless a significant proportion of node operators start running the forked implementation.
If miners want a fork you can't argue that a fork is bad for miners. If node operators want a fork you can't argue that a fork is bad for node operators. If miners, node operators, exchanges businesses and users all want a fork **you can not argue that a fork is bad for decentralisation**. 
What *is* bad for decentralisation is pissing off a whole lot of your users by constantly ignoring them and insisting that you know what's best for them. What *is* bad for decentralisation is turning into a settlement network that ordinary users can't afford to transact on.

My claim was Core haven't release code that would let users or miners signal their support (or lack thereof) for a blocksize hardfork. I don't need to provide evidence for the absence of that release, it is known.
Your claim is that the miners broke the HK agreement. This is asserting a positive and you should therefore be able to point to some evidence of the action you claim took place.
The reason you aren't showing any evidence is almost certainly because you're regurgitating something you read here multiple times. Whenever people are actually challenged to show how they think the miners broke that agreement, the best they can usually do is say that *one* mining pool started *testing* Bitcoin Classic *on testnet* and therefore "the miners broke the agreement". As piss-poor as that argument is, it's still better than what you have managed here.

Imagine Bitcoin splits in two, Bitcoin-A and Bitcoin-B. 
Bitcoin-A has thousands of nodes and 25% of the current hashrate. Bitcoin-B has hundreds of nodes and 75% of the hashrate. The communities around each coin want the other coin to fail so they can just go back to saying "Bitcoin".
Bitcoin-A is vulnerable to attacks from the superior hash-power dedicated to Bitcoin-B, so to defend themselves they either have to invest hundreds of millions of dollars building/buying more hashpower, or they have to fork their PoW algorithm to something new, then spend millions of dollars building a mining a new network that can defend against botnets.
Bitcoin-B has a much weaker node network. So they can either cross their fingers that post-fork the users switch over to running Bitcoin-B nodes, or they can collectively spend about $100k boosting node numbers into the thousands.

You're not arguing because you're not very good at it. 
I pointed out that having one defacto development group setting the rules for a protocol, and having a huge and seemingly violent barrier to any change that those developers disapprove of; is in fact centralisation.

If Bitcoin pushes all low (and then medium) sized transactions onto alt-coins it will be entirely reliant on large transactions for its value. What happens if those large transaction use cases move somewhere else?
Imagine you're running a casino. You may well want to attract high-rollers with insane sums of money to burn. But you also want the plebs with $100 in their pocket because there are orders of magnitude more of them. Narrowing your potential customer base is not usually a smart move.

Here's my question to you: 
If Bitcoin becomes purely a settlement layer for second-layer networks, are you going to run a Bitcoin node?
If Bitcoin can only be used for very large quite expensive transactions between financial service companies, are you as an individual going to help those companies by running a node at home?

If the developers force a change in the PoW algorithm, to get rid of the miners, to subsequently force through a softfork that they claimed should have near unanimous miner support.

At that point everyone will know that coin is centralised.

Putting aside Ethereum's history of DAO forkage; how much of an issue do you really think this is? There are tons of alt-coins with vastly less hashpower than Bitcoin. How often do these coins suffer from fraudulent double spend attacks? 
I can imagine that if someone wanted to make a truly gigantic transaction they would want a proportionally huge level of security. But if they are sending tens of millions of dollars they probably aren't that worried about waiting a few hours for plenty of confirmations. So they still don't really need Bitcoin's vastly larger hashpower.

Just because flag days were used before doesn't mean that they're a good or safe plan for activating a clearly contentious change to the protocol. Especially not with a fairly short 9 month notice period.
If flag days are such a great method then I'm not sure why the Core developers felt the need to implement miner signalling in the first place?
But most importantly I'm referring mainly to the comments here on this sub that it's somehow suddenly Ok if the UASF results in a chain split and associated turmoil. Isn't that why Theymos used to ban discussion of certain alternative implementations? To protect the network from massive contentious splits?

You may not have explicitly stated that Jihan controls the miners (a very popular rumour on this sub) but you did say:


Suggesting that if a BU fork occurred Jihan could singlehandedly change whatever he wants about Bitcoin. This implies that he controls the miners since changes without majority support would still be impossible.
Your fact also aren't facts. The Merkle is not a remotely reliable source for anything and even the crappy article you linked didn't say that Jihan was solely funding BU. In fact what it said was that ViaBTC claimed that Jihan claimed that Bitmain would support BU with funding. How does that turn into Jihan solely controlling BU in your head?

* But you don't want to spend $20 a month (probably less) on a dedicated node.  
* But you were happy until recently to use large amounts of expensive SSD storage on your current service.  
* Because it's still really important that you run a full node to instantly validate those very small number of increasingly expensive transactions.

Just to correct this: SegWit has been at around ~25% signalling [for four straight months]( now. The signalling period has another 8 months to run, but I think it must be clear to the Core developers that the miners are not going to activate SegWit under the current proposal.

There is nothing inconsistent in those two statements. He could just as easily have phrased it "people don't want to push the core devs away but their inaction has led us to this point".
Even without that interpretation, pushing people away doesn't dismiss the importance of their previous work and contributions. To stick with the Roman theme of OP; Julius Caesar did a lot of very good things for the Roman Empire. He also became a dictator and was eventually assassinated. The people who stabbed him didn't think he was some hapless, bumbling, waste of space. They thought he was a very intelligent person who had too much control.

If you're going to dismiss Gavin's "contribution to resolving the consensus" then you should really note a couple of other things.
1. Gavin didn't cause the fork as Dude suggested. The leveldb change was made by Mike Hearn and (I think) Pieter Wuille. None of the developers seemed to have any objection to this change and it effectively fixed a bug no-one knew existed.
2. Gavin didn't propose the solution to downgrade. You can see from mrchaddavis's link that Pieter Wuille suggested people upgrade to fix the problem, Gavin (and Jeff Garzik) merely supported that initial proposal. After a bit of discussion and a clear and quicker route to fixing the fork by downgrading; Gavin (and Jeff) supported that proposal, thus "contributing to resolving the consensus" (do you actually understand what that phrase means?).
@_date: 2017-03-20 23:40:53
It's important to everyone, not just me. I'm suggesting that if the Core developers have Bitcoins best interests in mind they will at some point have to consider that maybe they had some role in creating the current pending chain-split apocalypse, and that maybe they have a fairly substantial amount of power in resolving the conflict.
Other than "because we don't want to", can you explain why Schnorr signatures need to be deployed before the blocksize is changed?

It'd be interesting to see the distribution of the affected user's activity over time. Or even just when they signed up to Reddit. You've talked about sock puppets a lot lately, but always implicitly in relation to Classic/XT/btc people attacking the sub. 
Many of the affected users up there are names I recognise as only appearing once "the block wars" began, but immediately becoming some of the most prolific commenters and constantly reinforcing the Core party line.
I'm not saying any of that justifies downvote bots but Alexgorale, belcher, beastmodebisky, billyhodson; these people aren't poor redditors being attacked for their political views. They are accounts that were set up specifically to defend Core's policies and to pad out comments sections when many regular contributors left due to Theymos's information blackout.

Well sure, absolutely. If they are going to continue to develop Bitcoin Core then it makes sense. The part that doesn't make sense is continuing development at a hypothetical point when the vast majority of the Bitcoin ecosystem has actively rejected them.
They'd either be counting on Classic imploding and everyone coming crawling back (which the miners definitely won't because their equipment no longer works)
Or they'd be counting on building a whole new "Bitcoin-Core" ecosystem, virtually from scratch, while in direct competition with the old one.
I think if this scenario actually does play out then some of he Core developers will accept the fork and start working on Classic.

My understanding was that there are only two real manufacturers of ASICs, Bitfury and Bitmain. But only one of those companies (Bitmain) sells their hardware direct to the public through a webshop.
For some reason the company selling their products to anyone with money (Bitmain) is accused of being a dangerous, dictatorial attempt to co-opt the Bitcoin network. While the one that doesn't sell to the public (Bitfury) is frequently cheered on. 
Coincidentally Bitmain's CEO has spoken in favour of non-Core scaling solutions while Bitfury has loyally supported the Core roadmap. But that's just a side note and clearly has nothing to do with the way they are characterised by this community.

It would only quadruple the blocksize if Bitcoin usage quadrupled.

This isn't me politicising, this is objectively a political issue. 
If the problem were mining centralisation then, as you say, it would have been a problem for years. It would have been a problem (rather than a feature) when Adam, Luke and others flew to Hong-Kong to negotiate the prevention a Bitcoin Classic adoption.
When the Core developers wanted to deploy SegWit they used a signalling mechanism that only allowed miners to "vote" with no attempt to ensure users were onboard with this substantial change to Bitcoin.
Since some of the miners refused to signal readiness for SegWit the developers have decided that mining centralisation is clearly a huge and urgent problem (but only because the centralised miners won't do what the developers want). So we've seen months of propaganda directed at the one ASIC manufacturer that actually sells direct to consumer gear, and praise for the other manufacturer that just makes mining equipment for their own massively centralised operation.
Now Bitfury's ~~CEO~~ chairman has spoken out against Core's threats to inadvertently destroy his business, we're seeing the "hero" turn into a villain.
At a certain point you have to realise that even though mining centralisation isn't a good thing, it *really* isn't the problem here. Yes, these centralised mining operations are not the ideal way for hashpower to be distributed. But Jihan, Roger, Gavin, Mike, the Toomin brothers, and now Bitfury's George are not the manipulative megalomaniacs trying to control Bitcoin and shape it in a way that suits their needs.

It's not in Core's interests to leave themselves open to subjective accusations of foot dragging. It's not in Bitcoin's interest for Core to create ongoing uncertainty about when or if capacity increases will be made. 
A hardfork increasing the block limit *is* important. It's even included in the roadmap (just too vaguely). No amount of side-chains or second layer networks is going to allow a 1Mb blockchain to support global peer-to-peer commerce.

You're confusing the price of bitcoins with the price of Bitcoin transactions. 
Heavily constrained blocksize capacity means more expensive transactions, which means a narrow range of uses for Bitcoin, which means fewer users and less demand for bitcoins, which means lower price.
Higher blocksize capacity means cheaper transactions, which means Bitcoin is more useful, which means more people will use it for more things, which means greater demand for bitcoins, which means higher prices.
@_date: 2017-03-14 22:15:30
You're recycling. Quadratic sighash is a problem identified many years ago with any number of solutions. The simplest of which is just to cap the maximum size of a transaction.
Let me just fast forward the next couple of comments:  


Yes! I would much rather we have an arbitrary limit on the maximum size of an individual transaction than on the maximum size of a block. One prevents ridiculously huge transactions that screw up validation. The other prevents Bitcoin from being able to grow.

First up, this isn't a fact it's an opinion. Words have meaning and you are using them incorrectly.
Then your own statement undermines itself. Why did you feel the need to imply that BU has some shady massive funding source at the same time as criticising the number/quality of their developers?
Do you really have such reverence for software development that you think high quality devs can not be "bought" to work on projects they don't care about? 
Anyone with sufficient financial resources can put together a large team of experienced C++ devs and have them pull apart and put back together Bitcoin's protocol. So suggesting that BU has loads of money just hurts your argument.

The signalling mechanism designed by the Core developers is suddenly broken and needs replacing the moment the Core developers don't get what they want? That seems healthy!


If this was true then a blocksize hardfork would have been equally easy to implement.
"But a hardfork would be contentious!"
So is SegWit, otherwise it would have activated already.
"But a SegWit softfork is backwards compatible so wouldn't cause a fork unless people actively rejected it!"
The same is true of a blocksize hardfork. Passively non-upgrading nodes would be forked off the network (it happened in 2013) and a minority chain would quickly die out. It's only a problem if people actively make it a problem.


The Core developers did! They designed this signalling mechanism. They actively chose a method where user nodes don't matter and mining nodes do. If they do actually decide to take up this ridiculous UASF suggestion - especially when we're only 4 months into the 12 month signalling period - they will lose massive amounts of credibility with basically anyone who is paying attention.

A DDOS on a rival bank involves using your compute resources (or a rented botnet) to hammer the other banks services. A real world DDOS could be getting a whole bunch of people to stand outside the banks branches waving picket signs and preventing people getting in.
The coin-shuffling transaction churning described in this thread is more akin to bank customers going into their local branch, queueing up to see a teller, then asking to withdraw or deposit $1. Then going to the back of the line and repeating the process. Is that annoying? Yes. Is that something that a bank customer has every right to do? Yes. 
You don't have any authority, moral or otherwise, to tell me how I can or can't use my bitcoins. Isn't that why we're here? Is that what we all love about this currency. So if I decide I want to tumble those bitcoins over and over to protect my financial privacy, that's up to me.

What you mean is that none of the fork proposals have gained consensus support among the Core development team. That's a fine governance model if you trust that no individual in the Core development team would ever block proposals for spurious reasons.

Actually Coinbase isn't a Bitcoin exchange. They've pointed this out many times and they even launched Gdax, which is an actual exchange. 
Coinbase is a brokerage service. You are buying or selling bitcoins direct to the company, not to some other customer. Its not a service that's designed for trading in a volatile market. But for some reason people keep insisting on using it that way.

Both BU and SegWit have been limping along at 20-25% signalling support for months now. If antpool really does go for BU that will take it to over 40% of the hashrate. If other pools follow suit (I keep hearing that Jihan rules them with an iron first) then there will be a hardfork in the not to distant future and the market will choose its winner.

You're completely, and I suspect deliberately, ignoring everything I just said.
The miner centralisation problem only seems to be a problem when the miner in question disagrees with certain developer's plans. 
If the problem was *actually* centralisation then Bitfury would have been chastised for a long time while Bitmain would have been praised for actually selling equipment to the public (this decentralises mining). But instead the opposite has happened. 
People have accused Jihan Wu of manipulating or outright owning most other mining pools and refusing to sell equipment to people who don't do what he wants. There has never been any evidence of this, and given that anyone can go online and buy an antminer it doesn't hold any water.
Until literally yesterday people praised Bitfury for being pro-SegWit. They didn't care that Bitfury design manufacture and run their own massive mining farms without selling to the public. They didn't care that this one private company had a large chunk of the hashrate and seemingly no interest in helping decentralise the network. They just cared that Bitfury supported Core/SegWit and were therefore the "good guys". 
Now that the Bitfury CEO has responded negatively to talk of forking the PoW algorithm, rendering all their investment worthless, we get to watch in real-time as they turn out to be "bad guys" after all.

The sort of attack you are describing is entirely possible right now with Core. Miners don't need BU to be able to create excessively large blocks that the rest of the network will reject.


You said this literally minutes before describing this "miners attacking the network" scenario. Bitcoin does not require unanimity, it forces certain rules based on the collective will of the network. That's no less true under BU than Core. Arguably it's more true because the network is able to increase their desire and support for larger blocksizes directly rather than relying on a team of software developers to eventually adjust a parameter as and when they see fit.

The point here has nothing to do with BU. The point is that softforks are only opt-in at first. Eventually every softfork feature Core releases will be required. They aren't optional, they just have a long grace period.

A 20Mb **cap**, as in maximum limit hard coded at the protocol level. A 20Mb **cap** *does not mean* 20Mb **blocks**. Miners set their own soft caps on the **blocks** they generate, and they control the type of transactions they let into those blocks. 
Unless Bitcoin actually had some sort of massive tipping point adoption explosion we likely wouldn't have seen actual **blocks** larger than 3-4Mb for a few years at least. Gavin proposed a 20Mb **cap** because he wanted a solution that would hold for many years to come, not because he thought Bitcoin was suddenly going to go full mainstream.

As I've said a whole bunch of times: the statement put out by 20+ exchanges *explicitly* and *unequivocally* stated that they were not taking sides. So no, core doesn't have additional support.

At least a small subset of the developers (and Adam Back) went to Hong Kong to strike a deal with mining pool operators to ensure they would not switch to Bitcoin Classic. People can try to ret-con that meeting however they want but literally every honest person in this community knows that the purpose of the Hong Kong agreement *was* to prevent the adoption of Bitcoin Classic.
Nullc and maaku (both coincidentally from Blockstream) have repeatedly likened a hard fork to "firing the Core devs". They aren't just saying "I personally don't think that's safe and wouldn't work on Bitcoin anymore". They are attempting to speak on behalf of all those other developers. 
They are shitting the proverbial bed and deliberately trying to scare people into believing all the Core devs would abandon their years of work on Bitcoin if a single parameter was changed. Does that actually sound likely to you? Do you honestly believe all those people would just say "Welp, that's over. Guess I'll go work on something completely different now" in the event of a hardfork?
@_date: 2017-03-10 23:05:56
These are some excellent points.


Absolutely. There is definitely a danger that discussions on a subreddit like this might not accurately reflect the views of the community.


I'm curious if you have a roadmap for this too? What sort of time frame and milestones should we expect for you to go from requiring 95% mining consensus to deciding that miners don't matter at all and it will be totally safe to activate a SegWit softfork without them? 
I know it's a lengthy process that needs to be taken in steps, but it might be helpful for the community to know the route you plan on taking so they can keep track of progress.
@_date: 2017-03-19 12:39:00
The HK agreement explicitly referred to a blocksize hardfork. It didn't have any special conditions about "SegWit is effectively a blocksize increase, so that's all fine". It was also released in a way that only relies on miner signalling. 
The special irony of all these arguments about broad consensus and user-activation is that hard-forks actually require and demonstrate that consensus. Soft-forks skip consensus, let miners activate new features, then eventually force users to adopt them too when old implementations are forked-off or no longer supported. See bip50 for details of why Bitcoin versions prior to 0.8 are no longer compatible, or see [this message]( from Greg Maxwell for details of why any version below 10.2 is no longer safe to use.
The fact that miners are increasingly signalling BU now is actually a testament to the fact they largely stuck to their side of the agreement despite it being clear to most people that Core devs had ignored it. The agreement expired a couple of months ago. Coincidentally a large and increasing proportion of the miners have now started signalling their support for an implementation that could become non-Core compatible.

Are you aware that - in the event of a BU hardfork with a substantial majority of hashpower - Core are almost certainly going to change the PoW and/or difficulty via their own hardfork. If they didn't do that the legacy chain would have ridiculous confirmation times for weeks if not months, and it would be vulnerable to attacks from the miners who had chosen BU.
So if both versions of "Bitcoin" are hardforks and neither are "valid" according to older clients. Then which one will be the true Bitcoin?

I see, today we're using the definition of "consensus" that has nothing to do with general agreement. 
You're now proposing that substantial changes to the Bitcoin protocol should be made even if neither miners nor nodes agree to them. That Core should push out new implementations that are "technically" compatible with previous versions despite having increasingly divergent ways of doing things. That we should turn the code base into an increasingly garbled mess making it more and more challenging for anyone outside of the Core development team to build anything that safely interacts with the network.
The one reassuring thing about this UASF campaign is that I've seen virtually no-one of any consequence supporting it. I just hope the Core devs aren't waiting for the narrative to take hold before they say "yeah, you know what, let's completely ignore the rule set that *we* designed for SegWit softfork activation and do it in a dangerous way instead".

It does make sense if you don't believe the lack of progress over the last two years is accidental. 
The lack of a blocksize fork for the last two years has created an artificial capacity crisis. Somehow very smart people like Greg, Luke, and the rest of Blockstream's stakeholders couldn't see this coming and spent all this time claiming that blocks were nowhere near full so there was no urgency to do anything.
Luckily now that we've hit this totally unforeseeable wall SegWit is here to save the day (in a small and temporary way) so we'd better activate it. And what's more Blockstream has been working on off-chain scaling solutions for the last couple of years, they just need SegWit to activate so they can deploy their lightning network. 
What luck that all the politics, infighting, and *totally unpredictable* steady growth in Bitcoin transactions has led to a situation that just so happens to fit perfectly with the plans of the private company that employs virtually all the most vocal critics of those hardfork proposals.
We should definitely continue to follow Gregory Maxwell's scaling roadmap. He certainly doesn't have any conflict of interest and we can totally trust that the vaguely referenced future blocksize hardfork will actually be implemented... at some point... after an open-ended list of other changes... Maybe.

That doesn't support your assertion. Suggesting that every Bitcoin user should run a full node is ideological nonsense that only Luke Jr. really believes. We know that the vast majority of existing users don't run full nodes and that isn't likely to change with increased adoption. 
As your link says, the incentive is much stronger for businesses dealing in Bitcoins. But when it comes to exchanges, wallet providers, even decent sized retailers; the cost of running desktop vs the cost of running a server sized node is negligible.
I'm also curious what you think will happen to residential full node count if Bitcoin transitions to being an invisible settlement network that individuals can't really afford to use directly? i.e. If I can't cheaply send transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain, why would I run a node?
@_date: 2016-01-19 22:02:57
Miners will only support Bitcoin classic if they believe it also has the support of the rest of the community (exchanges, businesses, users, and at least some developers). So at the point of something like classic activating there really is no contention anymore. There's just an angry minority with less than 25% of the mining community behind them. 
This move would push that 25% across to the classic fork.
It's a win-win scenario really. Classic ends up with 100% mining support, and the Core developers who stay behind will no longer be under pressure to raise the cap, because there won't be any inconvenient commerce happening on their chain.
@_date: 2017-03-07 23:28:19


This community sometimes has a very liberal definition of proof when it comes to these matters. Would you mind linking to the proof in question?


As people are keen to point out when it suits the narrative, many people have contributed to Bitcoin Core. Very few of those people have been so massively vocal about the devastating dangers of hard-forks or blocksize increases. The vast majority of that noise has consistently come from Greg Maxwell, Luke-Jr and Peter Todd.
Actually now I think about it I'm not even convinced they would leave. Peter Todd has repeatedly caused huge controversy with his deliberate double-spend, replace-by-fee, and his public "I've sold half my bitcoins" FUD when gigahash got too big.
Luke clearly doesn't care what anyone thinks of him, or if he does he actively wants people to think he's crazy.
Greg might leave. Honestly I really hope Greg would leave. It doesn't really matter how good a software developer he might be, he's clearly a terribly disruptive person to have involved in a collaborative project.

This isn't me trolling this is you jumping around all over the place to try anything to post-hoc rationalise the things you're saying. 
The exchanges put out a big joint statement designed to give a clear and consistent message. Two of the signatories subsequently complained that an important point had been dropped. Coinbase's CEO made his own statement about why they hadn't signed and stated their own position. 
In the course of this short thread you have:
* Implied that the exchanges are clearly on Core's side and "Core has won!. 
When in reality the main statement was deliberately and explicitly neutral. The follow-up comments from ShapeShift, Kraken and Coinbase CEOs all weakened support for Core even further by saying the wording of the statement wasn't neutral enough.
* Then stated that the exchanges stated they would hand over the BTC ticker only if BU absolutely won.
That's not from the statement. It's from the follow-up comments. If that's what you meant you really should have said so.

The scenario being discussed is after a hardfork where ~75% of hashpower has gone over to BU. The Bitcoin Core coin would then have 40 minute confirmation times, it could take 8 weeks for difficulty to retarget, and if the majority of users really continued using it the transaction backlog would be insane. That armoured car has one wheel, and is extremely vulnerable to hypothetical attacks from the new armoured car company.

Why "reach out" with unreliable Internet polls when you've already got a much less gameable signalling mechanism in place?




You know precisely what I'm talking about. There is a world of difference between an alternative development team putting out a competing hardfork causing implementation vs. Core putting out a hardfork implementation and asking users to signal or not as they see fit.
This difference is particularly large when forum operators ban or selectively moderate discussion of the competing implementation, and when Core developers claim that activating that fork would be equivalent to "firing the core devs".

I'm just glad that there are still people we can trust to have bitcoin's best interests at heart. Like this guy - a Litecoin developer - making contraversial proposals to force though an unsafe soft-fork and likely force the miners to split the network. *Clearly* this guy wants nothing but what's best for Bitcoin and stands to gain nothing from furthering the drama and damaging the network.

Ok, if Mike were acting on behalf of an agency, why did XT only get 10% (pretty sure it peaked around 15%) of full nodes?
The NSA, GCHQ, CIA or even just a cartel of evil bankers could easily deploy thousands of XT nodes while making it look like "organic growth" or momentum or whatever. They could even have acquired/deployed a big chunk of hashing power to make it look like XT was gaining the support it needed from both nodes and miners.
Whether they could have actually forced the fork without genuine community support is debatable. But the very fact that XT nodes didn't swamp the network seems like pretty solid evidence Mike didn't have the backing of any nefarious well funded organisation.

There's a very good argument that if a hard-fork will be required it should be done sooner rather than later. The more Bitcoin grows the harder it is to safely roll out a hard-fork. 
You're right that block size is likely to be a recurring problem. That's precisely why bip101 was designed to progressively scale over a period of twenty years.

Great. Then Core needs to get off their ass and get a hardfork proposal to a point where people/miners can decide on whether to run it. Not doing that for the last two years is the reason some proportion of the community has become so frustrated.
@_date: 2017-03-01 00:20:29
The high enough debate did happen and wasn't particularly scientific. As you might guess I'd tend to side with Gavin that the threshold needs to be low enough that we aren't giving every mining pool veto rights, but high enough that the minority chain wouldn't have much hope of survival. 


We shouldn't be able to see *any* nodes that haven't upgraded or patched since August 2013 when the unpatched pre-0.8 nodes were unceremoniously booted off the network. As I said, they were given less than 6 months after the accidental fork to either upgrade to 0.8 or patch their earlier versions (if there were some rational reason to do that). 
I think morality is a generally unhelpful thing to bring into these discussions as its hugely subjective. I believe that we as a network have less responsibility to node operators who don't upgrade their software for two years than Microsoft has to me and my Windows XP viral incubator. At least I paid Microsoft for my software!
I do appreciate most of your comments here. But I'm pretty knackered and my iPad just refreshed erasing my last half-written reply. So I'm going to bed again. 
I hope you can see that my main point of contention is that if almost all Core devs agree a hard-fork for the blocksize will be necessary, it should be implemented (not necessarily activated) as soon as possible. I don't think SegWit will be activated without that happening, and that's what I meant by development gridlock. If Core can't get their new features implemented then Bitcoin will stagnate.
@_date: 2017-03-15 07:30:12
Yes, I'm not sure if we really disagree on anything. My main point was that security is a function of hashpower and time, and that very large transactions probably worry a lot less about time. 
If I'm selling my house I want the transaction to be very secure but I don't really care if that total security comes from six Bitcoin confirmations over 1 hour or six hundred Brickcoin confirmations over 100 hours.
So I'm suggesting that if Bitcoin becomes the expensive but highly secure cryptocurrency, which it is becoming:
* It's not competitive for small transactions because it's too expensive.  
* It's not competitive for large transactions that don't need very fast confirmation because they can achieve the same security on a cheaper blockchain over a longer period of time.
* It's only competitive area is large transactions that need to complete very quickly, and that's a really tiny niche to be carving out for the number1 cryptocurrency.

To clarify: I'm not saying that none of the companies on that list will support a UASF. They might. I'm just saying that you can't possibly take that list and say "these companies are in favour of a UASF". That's not what they signed up for and it would be damagingly disingenuous to start claiming that.
If you really want the UASF to happen I would honestly and genuinely suggest that you don't piss off companies on that list by making very dodgy claims about what they do and don't support.

Is this a reference to the statement from the exchanges?
I'm surprised how many people are interpreting that as the end of BU. It's literally an acknowledgment by the majority of exchanges that they *do* expect a hardfork to occur and they *will* at the very least support the withdrawal of "BTU" coins.
It's also become abundantly clear that an earlier draft of that statement showed that a number of those exchanges were willing to entertain the possibility that a BU hardfork could potentially "win" and replace the pre-fork chain.

@_date: 2017-03-19 12:57:31


Yet again I'm going to have to ask: I thought Core weren't in control of Bitcoin? Isn't that their line? They just put out software and users decide whether to use it. BU just put out software and users decide whether to use it. 
If anything a post-fork Bitcoin would have much more decentralised development because once the community has switched implementations once, there's a much lower barrier to them switching again if BU tries to implement something the community disagrees with (or fails to implement something the community wants).
The current policy of undying loyalty and trust towards one group of people is pretty unhealthy.
@_date: 2017-03-04 21:38:07


I don't really follow the semantic separation/clarification that you are trying to make here. Theymos gave a significant chunk of Bitcoiners a choice: Either cease discussion of the scaling proposal you think is a good way forward, or go someplace else to discuss it.
Now I know people will argue that private forums have the right to impose their own rules and users have the option to use them or not. But that's not what this is. Theymos *does* own a private bitcoin discussion forum, it's called bitcointalk. This is a subreddit. It's owned by reddit. It's hosted by, operated by, and the responsibility of reddit. Theymos is just a volunteer mod helping to prevent spam.

That sounds like a pretty good example of Roger refusing to admit he was wrong about something and being willing to say whatever it takes to fight his corner (plenty of that on both sides). But it's not really a convincing argument for why we need to "fire the miners" if they don't activate SegWit.

That sounds great for reassuring someone who really wants to be reassured. But it's all rubbish.
No, I can't buy Bitcoins and altcoins with the same money. But many people diversify their investments particularly if they start to worry about the stability of their primary investment. 
I also can't invest the same time in using two different social networks. Sure I could probably set something up so that my posts/photos/status/whatever get posted simultaneously to multiple sites. But I can't simultaneously consume stuff, or engage with my friends and contacts on both platforms. So there was indeed a cost of using Facebook when I already had a MySpace account. I paid that extra cost and so did many other people.
Furthermore, there absolutely *is* a long term investment in using a social network. The author of that piece is crazy! The whole point of every social network is that your network grows larger and more influential over time. Every post contributes or detracts value to your profile. I mean even on reddit, where most of us are effectively anonymous, most people hang on to the same account for years because all the history and karma attached to it gives their posts/comments just a little more weight.
So yes, social networks *do* have a strong network effect (I can't believe there's anyone who doesn't believe this), and they still get usurped if they become complacent.

They actually kind of *do* have that magic wand. A vast swathe of the most hardline small-blockers are actually just dedicated Core supporters.

Hold up. I thought BU was "totally controlled by Roger Ver"? Are Roger and Jihan the same person? Now that I think about it never seen them in the same room together. Maybe Jihan runs into a telephone box, takes his glasses off, and puts his JuJitsu Gi on and magically transforms into Roger.
But more seriously, I'm still confused on this whole "Jihan rules the miners" + "Jihan wants a BU fork" = 25% signalling for BU. How do you balance that equation? Is Jihan just really bad at controlling all the other mining operations? He's allegedly forced them in some way to *not* signal SegWit, but he can't seem to force them to support BU. 
Basically I see a lot of speculation and conspiracy theories, but the theories don't seem to make any sense.

Every version of Bitcoin Core/QT prior to 0.8 (that's **4 years** worth of releases) had a bug that ended up causing an unintentional hardfork. You should pop back to 2013 and tell everyone to abandon Bitcoin. I mean, who knows what else is lurking in the codebase?

There is very little downside to putting some reasonable cap on transaction size. If someone has a really really ridiculously massive transaction they want to create they can quite easily split it in two or more parts and transmit them all in the same block.

It sounds pretty spot on to me. You're dismissing measurable metrics and pushing for a flexibly defined concept of the "economic majority". You also haven't defined how much of a majority you would need. Essentially you're leaving the door open to:
1. Pick and choose which set of companies are big enough to get a say.
2. Pick a threshold that seems reasonable once you've already estimated how much support you're likely to get.
The half-baked UASF idea already goes way beyond shifting the goalposts, basically completely changing the sport. But the rules of the new sport aren't even written down because you want to make sure that this time you "win" no matter what.

Back in the day all nodes were mining nodes and initially all users were running nodes. Progressively we've separated out such that:
* Mining is done by a subset of people with specialist ASIC equipment
* Non-mining nodes are run by a few thousand users, and probably already mostly businesses.
* The vast majority of users have lightweight clients or hosted wallets and rely on the rest of the network for validation.
@_date: 2017-03-07 12:57:46
After years most of the Core devs are still publicly acknowledging that a hardfork *will* be necessary at some point, the only point of contention is when. 
A *modest* blocksize increase would not have been risky. Certainly no more so than up-to 4MB SegWit blocks. And it would have kept the fee pressure down while other optimisations and second layer networks were developed. 
Instead we've had stalling. Putting a blocksize hardfork as a solid "maybe" at the end of your roadmap is stalling. Telling miners "we'll produce hardfork code after you've activated SegWit" is stalling.
If a hardfork is risky to activate and requires almost everyone on the network to adopt it, shouldn't it be *implemented* ASAP so that a long activation period can be used and virtually anyone who isn't deliberately running ancient software will be onboard? Yet the very smart people at Core have deliberately avoided putting anything in place for the last two years. What would be your definition of "stalling"?

And again, all the concerns you just raised only arise from fear of a persistent hardfork, and a persistent hardfork is only a realistic risk because agitators like Greg and Luke have been threatening what amounts to a scorched-earth policy if the network forks away from Core. 
A "Core-approved" hardfork would have virtually no active resistance. As you described earlier there would be a risk to people running outdated nodes, but that isn't sufficient to induce a persistent fork. Miners would have to keep mining, exchanges would have to support the vestigial fork, and a substantial group of extremely stubborn people would have to work really hard to keep the losing chain going. 
That happened with ETH/ETC because some people had a lot to gain from keeping ETC alive. I can't see any *rational* reason why people would try to do the same thing with Bitcoin. And even if they did, where's the problem. We just talked about ETH and ETC. We both know exactly which pre/post chain forks we're referring to there. And we both know that the ETC chain pails in significance next to the "main" ETH chain.
To me the hypothetical PR fallout if people try really hard to force a persistent chain split is less concerning than the very likely PR crapstorm we're going to see when bitcoin's mainstream critics get wind of the transaction delays, rapidly increasing fees, and development gridlock that is causing them.
@_date: 2017-02-26 17:24:33
I put the quotes around "default" because I understand that it isn't supposed to be that way. I also know that you understand that most people will treat Bitcoin Core as *the* Bitcoin client and will assume that the latest version is the best version.
So no, running 0.13 doesn't indicate an explicit preference for SegWit. Those people aren't consciously ticking some opt-in box that says "I think SegWit is a good idea". They are just running the latest version of a piece of software.

That sounds like a danger to me. It would be arrogant to think that Bitcoin has come so far that we no longer need low value transactions.

The HK agreement was fairly obviously designed to dissuade the big Chinese miners from switching implementations.
The fact that multiple well known core developers, and Adam Back, flew out at short notice and then spent 18 hours locked in discussions suggests that this wasn't just some mini conference. It was in fact a negotiation.
Even the wording of the released statement suggested that the miners were agreeing not to switch so long as Core sticks to the agreed upon schedule for a fork.

Ah, I see. That's a good question. Whether their internal checks and balances would have identified the failure is hard to know. Probably depends entirely on what went wrong. 
If there was some human error inputting an account number and the transaction got sent to the wrong person I would expect they won't catch that. The only way they could is by locking customer accounts to specific bank withdrawal accounts. Another exchange I've used does that but it's kind of a shitty feature.

What you are describing is a hypothetical attack being proposed by random "big-blockers" in response to a hypothetical user activated soft fork being proposed by random "small-blockers". 
As far as I'm aware there has still been little to no support from Bitcoin Core devs for the UASF idea, and I believe at least Luke-Jr made some critical comments about it? 
So there's a stupid unsafe softfork fudge that Core is unlikely to support, and a hypothetical attack if it did somehow happen.

Ideas aren't dangerous. 
Suggesting, discussing, debating and analysing ideas is a good thing, even if the answer turns out to be "that idea does more harm than good and we shouldn't do it".
People shit on Mike for suggesting that it would be possible to black list coins from known crimes. But as far as I'm aware he never actually tried to implement that?

What the ever-loving fuck is wrong with you?
BitderbergGroup is an utter troll trying to present XT and Classic as Roger's attempts to control Bitcoin. When I challenged him to provide evidence he responded with a picture of a pigs testicles, twice, in true trolling bullshitter fashion.
The articles you cite (thanks for that, despite the shitty vitriol you presented with them) show that Roger was in favour of those proposals. They *don't* show that Roger was pulling some illuminati shit trying to usurp Bitcoin control for his own nefarious purposes. XT was setup by Gavin and Mike two prominent Bitcoin developers. Classic was setup by the Toomin brothers. I still see no evidence that Roger was involved with, rather than in favour of, either of those proposals.
Isn't support from the economic majority a pretty important factor in all these discussion? It's supposed to be the whole basis of a hypothetical UASF. So wasn't Roger doing exactly the right thing by publicly stating his support for XT or Classic as a major economic participant?
Or is that kind of support only valid when it's directed at Core?

I don't think that's really an option anymore. A year or two ago a modest one time blocksize increase from Core would have been accepted with the assumption that a further increase could happen at some point in the future. 
After all the arguing, stalling, and carefully worded agreements with miners; people are suspicious that a subset of the Core developers are actively opposed to on chain scaling and are intent on constraining Bitcoin to incentivise uptake of their off-chain products.
Whether *you* personally believe that doesn't matter, some people do and those people won't now trust a one-off can-kick proposal from Core.

For what it's worth, even from the title alone I didn't take it as a Core statement. I also don't take statements from Maxwell, Adam Back or Luke Jr to be anything but personal opinions.
Despite what others have said in this thread I don't think you should hold back from giving your personal opinions on important issues. It seems completely predictable to me that in the event of one of these "contentious hardforks" actually happening, either Core leadership would accept the block size changes or some number of the many Core developers would "defect" to the new implementation.

What if refusing to raise the cap *is* them acting odd, and the public *has* noticed? 


Which doesn't help at all if a fork is nearly impossible. Few if any other open source projects have a strong financial incentive binding everything and everyone together. So there's really no reason to expect Bitcoin to be as resilient and difficult to corrupt as other open source projects.

Even in the hypothetical scenario where Core supports a hard fork you are still referring to it as "contentious" and talking about "the other side". 
Of course there are people who think that Bitcoin can - and will eventually have to - support bigger than 2Mb blocks. But at this acrimonious point the combination of a 2Mb cap and the additional capacity when SegWit is implemented would be enough to satisfy demand for a couple of years.

As someone who had been reading this sub for at least three years - there was no obvious evidence of brigading. 
The Bitcoin community, particularly on Reddit, tends to pick a topic and run with it like crazy for a while. There have always been phases where there were 10 articles on the same topic on the front page, and still a bunch of jackasses submitting duplicates. That's poor quality redditting, but it's not suddenly fraudulent because theymos disagreed with the flavour of the month.

As far as I know neither litecoin nor dogecoin has reached a point where the demand for use exceeds their transaction capacity. So the same rules don't yet apply. 
Bitcoin has broader adoption than any other crytocurrency. As such it has reached the point where the different things people want to use it for are competing for limited transaction space. The fee-market means that things Bitcoin used to be useful for (any smallish transaction) are no longer efficient. This will push those use-cases away from Bitcoin onto other coins - possibly those very alts you mentioned.
If people who used to buy Bitcoin to spend at their local bar no longer do so because of high fees that means there is less overall demand for Bitcoin. That demand is what drives the price.

It's wouldn't be BU. If BU does result in larger blocks, thus creating a hard fork, Core is free to adjust their blocksize restrictions to fit with the rest of the network. 
They can keep working with the same team. They can still make whatever other compatible changes they want. They can even make incompatible changes like introducing a static blocksize limit if they believe a substantial majority of the network will adopt those rules. 
@_date: 2017-03-10 07:57:12

Sure, the early conversation there doesn't compare to the "debate" we've had for the last couple of years. But I think it's an important starting point for people to see. 
There already was some form of debate back then with Jeff suggesting that the issue should be address while the network was small and easy to "upgrade", while others including Satoshi didn't see why this would become a problem.
@_date: 2017-03-19 13:22:56
The exchanges explicitly stated that they *were not* taking sides.
I don't know why Jihan got pissy about it. I don't know why so many BU supporters seem to have responded negatively to it. To me, having 20+ exchanges publicly acknowledge that they think a hardfork is likely and that they have plans to support the BU fork, actually lends significant credibility to BU. The addtional sections that were removed would clearly have made the statement a lot more "neutral", but I can understand why they wanted to get something that as many companies would sign as possible.
@_date: 2016-01-23 12:35:21


No, there isn't really much danger there. All of the proposed alternative clients have put rules in place such that their forked rules won't kick in until a supermajority of miners are running the alt-client consistently over a period of two weeks. Then there is a 4 week grace period designed to allow others to switch over once the fork becomes inevitable. Because the rule change affects blocksize there may well be an even longer unofficial grace period before the miners change their soft caps and a block larger than 1Mb is actually produced.
The only way this lengthy and carefully laid out process would result in a dangerously split chain is if people hold their breath and stamp their feet in the face of the very "overwhelming economic consensus" that they have asked for. Even then it's unlikely that the exchanges, businesses or big mining pools would put pride over profits. So the legacy chain would be effectively abandoned before the fork rules kicked in.


Hard forks only split the chain in the unlikely hardheaded situation described above. Soft forks create their own problems by making Bitcoin more complex and confusing. i.e. Which wallet do you use? Will they take the time and effort to support SegWit? Does the company you're buying stuff from accept RBF flagged transactions?
Those problems disappear when using a well planned hardfork.


I agree that hardworking to another fixed cap is far from ideal. That's why XT was designed to progressively scale for the next 20 years. In hindsight they went to aggressive with the numbers and left themselves open to misrepresentation. But that's because Gavin and Mike understood that raising the cap wouldn't automatically raise the block size. There are other levels of blocksize control to prevent the sort of problems that Core devs and supporters have alluded to.


You're original sign-off was dickish. If you can't see that then I don't know what to tell you.

So he's not wrong then. Poloniex didn't sign the letter even though they presumably had the opportunity, that's all he pointed out there. 
The ShapeShift and Kraken CEOs ultimately said that they agreed with the statement but also wanted to make it clear that an earlier draft had included additional text giving a much more clear acknowledgement that a successful hardfork *could* ultimately replace Bitcoin if the legacy chain basically dies out.
Brian's concerns about the perception of this statement were clearly well founded. So many people on this sub have been celebrating the statement as if it actually said:

If people who have spent years working on Bitcoin decide to throw a tantrum because the Bitcoin community opts to change a simple blocksize parameter in a way they don't like; maybe those aren't very reliable developers...
Personally I suspect the vast majority of Bitcoin Core's contributors would want to continue their involvement. Though perhaps those who have full time jobs working on commercial extensions to Bitcoin would decide to leave the protocol alone and focus on their companies.


I don't know, you should ask the Core developers.


If Bitcoin unlimited successfully activated a hardfork then Bitcoin Core developers could continue to contribute to Bitcoin Core. They could even put out an implementation that attempted to re-implement centrally planned limits on blocksize if they thought the community would support that. Why do you think a BU hardfork magically blocks any software other than BU?
@_date: 2017-03-19 14:41:31
Thanks for actually responding.
1. That's true. But it would require some major change to the role being played by the entity. BU allows changes to the blocksize rules if and when the network chooses to change it. BU doesn't prevent other implementations putting out software that conforms to the new blocksize rules. BU doesn't even prevent other implementations putting in stricter blocksize rules if they can get the network to follow them.
2. See point 1. There's nothing different here. If Core drops the insistence on controlling blocksize they can implement any and every optimisation feature they want, including SegWit. If they're really the most awesomest team of super-friend developers then the whole network will surely be running Core releases within a year, just not with constant transaction congestion.
3. Jihan Wu doesn't have a mining dictatorship. This is blatant endless propaganda and it doesn't make any sense whatsoever. If he really controls all the big mining pools BU would already have forked.
4. I'm not ok with handing Control to Jihan, Roger or any other bogeyman you want to cite (I believe the BU president is today's scarecrow). I don't believe they would have any more "control" over Bitcoin under BU than they do now.
@_date: 2017-03-19 17:26:38
That sounds a lot like projection.


Blockstream employs a "communications officer" who spends a lot of time here and on Twitter pushing SegWit and attacking anyone who proposes blocksize hardforks. 
Then there's BTCdrak (assuming these are different people) who works very hard on Core's behalf to put together lists of SegWit "supporting" companies while simultaneously attacking alternative proposals in a similar way.
You don't see a problem with these guys because they share your view. But in at least one case that is literally a person paid to "AstroTurf" discussions. 


Are you going to pretend that DOS attacks have not been directed at non-Core clients? I mean it's actually far worse than that. The attacks last week were an example of a Core developer unethically and very publicly disclosing (or rather promoting) a bug that the BU developers were in the process of fixing. If someone did that to Core you would be livid and would consider that person to be massively unethical, would you not?


Do I seriously even have to address this one? Some of Bitcoin's earliest and most important individuals and companies have been crucified for making comments supporting anything but the Core party line.


I'm not going to say I completely agree with the approach BU has taken to proposals, but I do understand why they've done it. The least scrupulous members of Core and those who avidly support them will take any route to undermine any kind of competition. This includes submitting spurious or outright dangerous proposals to BU, thus tangling them up in endless debate and preventing them from getting on with real work.
By contrast the Core development model of poorly defined consensus is extremely vulnerable to intelligent but uncollaborative participants who want to get their own way and are entirely willing to do nothing unless or until they can do the thing they want or need.
Maxwell has claimed that now SegWit is out there they aren't in all that much of a rush to get it activated. But he's heavily invested in his company that needs SegWit in order to deploy their Lightning Network. 
Maaku (another Blockstream developer) has said that if SegWit doesn't reached activation by the end of its 12 month signalling period, they should just reset the clock and give miners another year to adopt it.
Do you *really* believe that these guys and their commercial company don't care about activation a change to Bitcoin that will enable the deployment of one of their finished products? That they don't have a pretty huge and obvious conflict of interest on this topic?

Allow me to paraphrase:
I didn't make up anything tho... here's a link to a post from rbitcoin's latest mega-troll providing a screenshot of an easily gameable metric which for some reason bares no relation to the node distributions shown on popular node-counting websites.
I have no time to look for a document about devs... And I also know that any document I found would not do anything to prove that developers will abandon Bitcoin if the blocksize is hardforked. Virtually none of them have ever come out and said that because they've invested years working on and learning about this project. So throwing a shit-fit and quitting Bitcoin because of a change to a technical parameter would be incredibly childish.
I did provide some evidence about the service providers... Who have taken steps to implement SegWit support since they believed it was likely to be implemented. I do however recognise that this action represents basic forward planning and doesn't actually provide any evidence for the likely actions of those service providers in the event of a hardfork.

This is a pretty ludicrous statement depending on where you live.
For most people trying to buy Bitcoin for the first time it's more like:  
* You sign up with some exchange or other service.  
* You jump through a bunch of hoops providing all sorts of personal documentation to get verified.  
* You send some funds, buy some bitcoins and relax.  
* You read a thread where people are screaming "don't leave funds on exchanges. If you don't have the keys they aren't your bitcoins!"  
* You download an app and transfer your bitcoins to your own wallet.  
* Your bitcoins disappear because you read some bad advice about brain wallets or you updated your OS without writing down your recovery seed.
In comparison an ETF would make investing in Bitcoin much the same as investing in a company or index-tracker fund. Something millions upon millions of people are used to doing.

Currently SegWit is sitting around 25% and "this side" is starting to claim that the rules never made sense in first place and actually we should use a whole different and much less quantifiable metric to justify activating SegWit.

Every decent hotel in the world has a small set of fancy suites with balconies overlooking the ocean, or park, or city skyline. *And* they have a ton of shitty little rooms with views of the brick wall next door.
Even Apple, famous for knowingly selling overpriced hardware to people who care about the brand, tend to keep making/selling out-of-date iPhones at reduced prices for a year or more after a new model comes out. They do so because they don't want to leave that slice of the market to their competitors. They don't want to rely only on the small subset of people who are prepared to pay $700 for a phone. They don't want their competitors to gain reputation with that middle tier of customers.
So no, it's not that I'm some dumbass who thinks low value customers have value.

I agree that at higher levels of income people are more likely to invest additional income because they want to make their money work for them and they want to avoid inflation eating away at their savings.

So now you: Which (or how many) of the Core developers do you believe will abandon their years of work if BU causes a successful blocksize cap-removing hard fork?
It should be an easy one to answer. If you're confident that BU can't succeed then you can say literally anything and never be proven wrong. The only way you can "lose" here is if the hardfork happens *and* the Core devs keep working on the bigger-block-Bitcoin.

I'm comparing it to stock market *investing*, not trading. People invest their money to beat inflation. If currency stops being inflationary or even becomes deflationary then the incentive to invest is weakened (not necessarily gone, but weakened).

It's a good question to genuinely think about and it's good to recognise (as per your edit) that it's always possible that all those other people might not actually be wrong.
People talk about Bitcoin as a store of value but usually what they mean is "my Bitcoin is worth way more than I paid for it!". Money is designed specifically to "store" value, as in retain approximately the same value over time. Yes central banks tend to induce small rates of inflation to incentivise investment and debt, but most monetary policy is aimed at just keeping the currency from gaining or losing too much value.

No-one is proposing to hard-fork Bitcoin in a way that reverts massive transactions. No-one would have such a clear incentive to desperately breathe life into the losing chain.

That's a really interesting post but I don't think what you were suggesting was ever really feasible.

There are three things with relative values here: gold, USD, every other fucking thing.
Either gold **purchasing power** went up about 200% between 2007 and 2012 or USD **purchasing power** went down 67% in that same period. 
We can determine which of those things happened by comparing against that third category of "every other fucking thing". Our analysis clearly shows that gold went up in value a huge fucking amount during those years, and the USD lost a very small and completely deliberate amount of value over the same period.

At the time Satoshi introduced the blocksize cap he didn't bother discussing it with anyone or (I believe) even note it in the release notes. He put out a version that was ostensibly "bug fixes" and quietly introduced a constraint on maximum blocksize.
That was all fine at the time because Satoshi was still effectively the benevolent dictator of Bitcoin. He didn't want or need to get into big debates about how *his* invention should or shouldn't work. So he almost certainly envisaged being able to change that parameter as and when it was necessary without any huge debate. 
Then, for whatever reason, he left.

If only people had realised this blocksize limit would be a problem earlier! 
It's been 11 months since the infamous Hong Kong agreement was made. An agreement designed specifically to head-off the potential adoption of Bitcoin Classic.
Bitcoin Classic was itself a huge step down from the scaling hardfork proposed by Bitcoin XT in the summer of 2015. And the only reason Bitcoin XT was released in the first place was because some of the developers and community were frustrated by the lengthy circular discussions that had been going on for quite some time before that.
If members of the development team had all acknowledged two fricking years ago that a 1MB static cap was not going to work long term and had worked on agreeing and implanting some modest scaling proposal we would have had more than enough lead time to ensure the hard fork was activated safely.

Yes! Jesus Christ man, the fact that you're sceptical whether Bitcoin will ever go back to a price it was at two fricking weeks ago tells me you've got a bad case of Bitcoin fever. 
The infection inhibits the parts of your brain that lets you make realistic evidence based predictions about the future and causes you to make terrible investing decisions like dumping everything you have into a very volatile asset that is currently sitting close to an all time high.
I understand your rationale about living rent free with your parents and therefore not ending up on the streets if it all goes pop. But have you considered that you have a responsibility to them? They are continuing to look after you into your adult life when others might kick you out the nest and make you support yourself. 
You've been sensible up until recently and have taken the opportunity they gave you to save up a small chunk of money.

I don't think so. SegWit creates larger blocks/more transaction throughout while also shifting incentives to favour big complex transactions at the expense of small simple transactions. Increasing the blocksize limit just creates larger blocks/more transaction throughput.

The key to what?
Ever since SegWit as a soft-fork was proposed it has been used as a reason to delay a blocksize hardfork. Before SegWit was proposed there had already been extensive discussions and proposals regarding the blocksize and a necessary increase or removal. 
The same voices who say "SegWit before/instead of a hardfork" were the ones previously just shooting down blocksize increases in the past. What makes you think they would have changed their stance if SegWit hadn't come about?

Are you new?
The Bitcoin blockchain has been rolled back to fix problems at least twice. Once in 2010 when someone exploited a bug to create billions of bitcoins for themself (stealing from everyone by massive inflation), and once in 2013 when an accidental fork occurred and people could spend their coins on both chains independently.
@_date: 2016-06-20 22:13:10
Just so I'm getting this 100% correct...
Your position stated over the last couple of comments is that gold prices are actually stable and the 200% spike shown in the linked plot is really a case of USD decreasing in value rather than gold increasing. 
You also believe that the Fed has been actively suppressing the price of gold during that time. So the dollar *really* lost even more than the two-thirds of its value shown by that gold plot. 
But for some reason pretty much every other thing that people buy only increase in line with the clearly false inflation rate of ~2-3% per year. This conspiracy is off the charts! The people need to know!

Surely it means SegWit has over twice as many blocks over twice the period? Otherwise this plot is really confusing.
20% for red line means BIP66 had 200 of the last 1000 blocks (roughly one week)

I'll take another shot.
SegWit isn't a long term solution to increasing Bitcoin traffic. It just provides a tiny bit more headroom kicking the can further down the road.
SegWit plus Lightning network isn't a long term solution to increasing Bitcoin traffic. A global scale lightning network would still require much larger Bitcoin blocksize capacity, or would need to settle on another blockchain. It would however kick the can even further down the road.
The further we kick the can the harder it gets to actually change something like the maxblocksize because there are more users, more wallets and services, more nodes, and maybe if we're lucky more miners. 
A hardfork six years ago when Jeff Garzik raised this issue would have been piss easy compared with today because the community was much smaller. A hardfork six years from now will be insanely difficult compared with today because the community will hopefully be much much larger.
So activating SegWit makes it harder to address the real long term issue that *will* eventually need to be addressed.

However there is a neat little use case for RBF for unsticking stuck transactions when there is heavy network contention and everyone is scrambling to pay their way to the front of the queue.

They're really not valid. Anyone can say anything at any time. I could tell every pollster that I'm going to vote Trump, but what matters is the actual vote. And yes, segwit activation is actually a vote and people do actually have the right to vote whichever way they choose for whatever reasons they have. It was specifically designed that way by the Core developers.


They are looking for a fix to a problem Satoshi inadvertently created five or six years ago. Blocksize was not supposed to be a permanent immovable object carved into the very DNA of Bitcoin. It was a temporary kludge to defend against possible spamming. Now it has become a weapon through which a small number of devs can control Bitcoin. 
They don't actually want to fix this problem. They don't want a progressively increase cap, they definitely don't want an adaptive cap that can adjust to the actual network usage. Because any *actual* solution takes away this weapon from their arsenal.

It's interesting that you would project your own childish "throw your toys out of the pram" attitude onto the developers. I prefer to think of them as mature adults.

I'm not even sure Satoshi announced the fact that he'd introduced the limit. Perhaps he knew it would be controversial, or feared that the announcement would trigger spam attacks before users had upgraded to his new limited implementation.
He did however say:
["We can phase in a change later if we get closer to needing it."]( 
And even proposed a simple triggering mechanism for when that became necessary: 
["It can be phased in, like:](
if (blocknumber &gt; 115000)
    maxblocksize = largerlimit"
So, do you believe he intended it to be a permanent limit, a short term spam prevention mechanism, or something else?

This, and the comments about PGP are where I disagree. Bitcoin is never going to be something where there's a busy full node buzzing away in the corner of every home. It already requires more space and more bandwidth than a disinterested casual user is going to provide, that's what SPV wallets are for.
By the same merit I don't think the progress of a potentially revolutionary global financial network should be hamstrung by limiting itself to the network capabilities of the crappiest areas of the world. If fifteen years from now all the full nodes are located in major cities, that's not really a problem. So long as those cities are spread across thousands of miles and scores of different countries that still looks a lot like decentralised validation to me.
The really confusion contradictory part to me is that the block size curtailment is apparently mostly to prevent loss of "hobby" full nodes. But if the layered scaling solutions relegate Bitcoin to a settlement network no-one is going to be interested in running a full node anyway. If I can't directly post my transactions on the network and have to pay to go through lightning nodes why am I dedicating my bandwidth and storage space to helping them?
@_date: 2016-11-30 02:55:30
You could be right. Maybe we could test this theory by releasing an implementation that includes both SegWit and a long term fix for blocksize increases. If that still gets attacked and the miners still don't want to activate it your hypothesis would be supported.

We'll hold up there. It seems like your ultimate answer is that they wouldn't be in control because: 


So then by your own metrics it doesn't matter if there is one developer of one thousand. 
But let's assume that it does matter and that the developer do and are exerting control over Bitcoin. The number of developers working on a proposed alternative implementation is always going to be substantially smaller than the number working on the current default implementation that carries all the network effect.
If Bitcoin Unlimited or any other alternative implementation becomes dominant then the vast majority of the developers currently listed on the Core contributors page would undoubtedly start working on the "new Bitcoin" code instead. Most of them don't give a single shit about Core, Blockstream, Roger Ver, Theymos, or any of this drama.

First up; none of what you just said changes the fact that the relationship between supply and demand is fundamentally broken by the artificial cap. Miners getting richer or even holders theoretically getting richer doesn't stop the transaction fees from trending ever upwards making Bitcoin useless for things that it used to be used for.
Secondly "more security attracts more users"? That just isn't really true. A year from now potential new users aren't going to say to themselves "oh, Bitcoin transactions cost $2 each now, I'd heard that it was supposed to be cheap. But on the other hand look at that massive hash power!". People view security in binary terms. To them Bitcoin either is or isn't a secure transaction network. Multiples of exahashes means nothing to them.

The lost value is taken by all of us who are currently working, investing, actively earning more money today. A major point of inflation is to value and incentivise the work that needs doing tomorrow more than the work that was done yesterday. Or, in a more extreme example, the work someone did 100 years ago should be valued less than the equivalent work today.

You're missing one important point. 
We have it on good authority that if the miners were to start "misbehaving" then Core could and would fork the PoW algorithm rending all those ASICs useless. 
What you just described is literally an attack on the network designed to circumvent the voting requirements specifically chosen by the Core developers themselves. I can't think of any clearer definition of misbehaving than that. 
So we have to assume that if this attack were to begin then Core would surely act in exactly the way they have discussed in the past. No?

Experts have found that if they base their assumptions about full node hardware on Steam user's system specs there is a danger that all the nodes will vanish soon regardless. Because apparently we're all running shitty netbooks with 2GB of ram and a 128GB hard drive.
Experts have basically found whatever they wanted to find, post-hoc, having already gotten into a raging philosophical debate about hardware vs. software scaling. Both should happen. Both should be used.

I don't understand the source of your confusion?
If the blocksize were gradually increasing, or retargetting in some way, then second layer scaling solutions like lightning networks would be *less* urgently needed. 
That means there would be more time for development and testing, and the users/miners/community would likely be more cautious about adopting those second layer solutions. Any disagreement so far?
Blockstream are developing second layer solutions. Those solutions (and any Bitcoin changes they need to facilitate those solutions) are more likely to be adopted quickly because increasing the blocksize is apparently so very "contentious". The contention around raising the blocksize has been massively cultivated by a very small number of Core devs (with a lot of help from Theymos), most prominently Greg Maxwell of Blockstream. 
So you have Greg and others spending literally hundreds if not thousands of hours working social media to reinforce the idea that Bitcoin will die in a fire if the blocksize is changed. While his company works on something that just so happens to benefit from a heavily contended blockchain. 
You still *honestly* can't see any possible conflict of interest going on there?

I keep hearing variations on "Perfect is the enemy of good" here lately, which is really ironic because I'm pretty sure it's exactly what Gavin said in relation to pursuing SegWit etc before simply adjusting the blocksize. 
Restructuring blocks, changing the way transactions are verified, changing the economics of how transaction fees work. SegWit can never be presented as the "keep it simple stupid" solution. It's a major change to Bitcoin that just happens to increase transaction capacity a little by accident. 
The fact that SegWit is being increasingly touted as *the only* solution for transaction scaling is a perfect example of why the blocksize cap is a problem. SegWit should be activated - or not - on its own merits. Using blocksize pressure as a whip to get people to accept it is like a page right out of the manipulative politics playbook. Keeping the blocksize cap in place means the Core devs will keep using that whip in the future.

There's a difference between "decent sized business" and "large corporations". We don't have to draw a false dichotomy between a raspberry pi in the corner of you living room vs. an 8 foot tall server rack in a datacenter. 
The current blockchain takes about 100GB of storage and can grow at no more than ~50GB per year. Yes, relaying transactions take a lot of upload, but any but the smallest start-up will already be paying for "business broadband" with sensibly balanced up/down rates.
So if I've got a company of 100 people, annual salary costs of $5-10 million. How much is too much for me to invest in using Bitcoin? $10k, $20k? I'd think $2k of hardware plus an extra $100 a month towards the Internet costs would support a blockchain with 10MB blocks. 
There are literally hundreds of thousands of companies that size who could be running nodes if Bitcoin actually becomes usable for them. That's plenty enough decentralisation for me.

Gold is a scarce resource. When the demand for gold exceeds supply the price goes up. When the price goes up gold mining companies invest more money in expanding their operations. That added investment increases the supply of gold. The gold price reaches a new equilibrium.
Bitcoin transactions are a scarce resource. When demand exceeds supply the cost of transactions goes up. When transaction costs go up... Nothing happens. The miners make more money, they can invest in faster hash power, bigger datacentres, anything they want. But nothing they do will increase the supply of transactions and redress the imbalance between supply and demand.

There are no actual quotes in my previous comment. The quoted text is clearly an example of what I think developers *should* be saying but aren't. 
My comment about certain people cementing themselves - and their professional pride - to the idea that hard forks are catastrophically impossible really doesn't need supporting quotes. Anyone who has followed this debate for the last two God damn years has seen a steady progression from "no HF yet" to "after all this other stuff we want to do... Maybe" to finally "let's just do everything by soft forks, that sounds way more cuddly and less dangerous". 
If Maxwell or anyone else at Blockstream wanted to repair some of the rift in the community they could do so in a second by publicly stating something like:


The fact that they avoid statements even that vague tells you everything you need to know about the actual plans. 
You also didn't point out any misunderstanding of block size to me. I understand that SegWit fudges the max blocksize cap by splitting the transaction data. I also understand that a one-off 70% increase (if users fully adopt SegWit) is not a scaling solution. It's a happy accident.

I don't generally buy into the conspiracy theories, but your argument against them is ridiculous.
Coinbase, Cirlce, BitPay, 21.co etc have somewhat clear business models based on providing services that use the Bitcoin blockchain. They all need Bitcoin to work in order for their businesses to succeed. Plus - as often pointed out as criticism - they don't employ/fund a bunch of the developers working on Bitcoin Core, so that limits their ability to make or prevent changes at the protocol level.
Blockstream's business plan is a whole lot less clear. They are developing second layer solutions that are that much more desirable because of Bitcoin's lack of built in scaling. They are developing second layer solutions that can actually run on any old blockchain, so the success or failure of Bitcoin doesn't make much difference to their products. They are developing second layer solutions which would work better if certain protocol level changes were made to Bitcoin. And importantly they are employing and contracting a substantial number of Bitcoin Cores most active developers who all happen to be working on and supporting the changes that Blockstream needs while vigorously fighting against the sort of changes that would make second layer scaling solutions less urgent and less profitable.

I absolutely love that you decided to insult anyone who disagrees with you before they even had a chance to. Beautiful.
A few years ago Bitcoin companies could have been forgiven for believing that cheap transaction throughput in Bitcoin wouldn't be a problem, either because they weren't aware of the blocksize limit or because they expected that the developers would deal with that limitation before it was reached.
Today, and moving forward, you would have to be an idiot living under a rock to build a Bitcoin without knowing about the limitations of on chain scaling. If there was a fork to 8 or 16MB then those businesses would know full well that there was an 8 or 16MB limit and would plan their businesses accordingly. There is no "moral hazard".

The US could switch to a new currency as all those European countries did when the Euro came into existence.
The Federal Reserve could change its policy on inflation.
The Federal Reserve could simply fail to meet its own target for inflation due to external forces. Remember how the US has been pushing for China to let its currency appreciate in value for decades? Well China would also love to see a stronger dollar.
Bitcoin could remain in existence with almost no value. I've seen people here claim they would buy every last Bitcoin for a penny if it ever drops that low.
Bitcoin could change its cap introducing permanent low level inflation.
Bitcoin could be relegated to some sort of intra-bank ledger with no real world value.

I'm curious how long you have been involved in Bitcoin? For much of its existence Bitcoin has been pitched as a cheaper quicker alternative to PayPal or credit cards. When the blockspace becomes heavily contended - whether from "spam attacks" or growth in users - Bitcoin becomes more expensive, slower, and unpredictable. 
Your entire premise seems to be that someone might spend millions of dollars DDoSing nodes to cripple the network for an hour or two. With blocks close to - if not already at - capacity it's *a lot* cheaper to fire off millions of transactions with varying fees making it extemely difficult for real users to get their transactions confirmed.
An actual well funded spam attack would be much more effective and much easier than taking out thousands of nodes.

You are trying to claim that the devs won't release the HF code because they don't believe the community wants it. If the community really don't want it then they can simply not adopt it, so there is no reason not to release the code. 
If SegWit signalling doesn't pick up, if miners make it clear they want the maxblocksize hard-fork, and if the developers still drag their feet on implementing it. That won't be because of lack of community consensus.

Luke is probably the Core dev most absolutely opposed to raising the blocksize. He has said on many occasions that, if anything, we should reduce the blocksize cap so that he can keep running his mining operation over the same dial-up AOL connection he got in 1998.

Some people have been arguing for literally six years that the maxblocksize cap was eventually going to cause problems and should be increased or removed altogether. 
As the limit *has* been reached, transactions *have* become contended, fees *have* risen, more and more people have started to pay attention to an issue that should have been addressed years ago. Because now it's starting to noticeably impact the way they use Bitcoin.
SegWit accidentally provides a little more transaction throughput temporarily relieving the contention. So some portion of the people currently in favour of raising the block size limit would likely forget all about it again once the extra fraction of a MB was available and fees/confirmation times temporarily dropped back down.
That's why a bunch of people who might actually think SegWit is worth activating don't want it activated.
Make it a hardfork, include a permanent progressive but conservative scaling of the maxblocksize and see just how much opposition that gets.

I'm just pointing out how ridiculous the propaganda wars have gotten. Roger, Viabitcoin, Bitcoin Unlimited; none of them can block something that hasn't even started yet. 
Yet I'm already seeing plenty of posts claiming that "people blocking SegWit clearly don't want Bitcoin to scale". I can't even read that without picturing the shit-eating grins on the OP's faces since they know how ridiculous that sounds to anyone who has actually been around for more than a couple of months.

You didn't have any point to side-step. Someone else was asked to explain what they felt was inaccurate about Roger's description. You decided to jump in, you didn't actually disagree with or debunk what Roger said (seriously, go back and take another read of your own comment), but instead you through a bunch of vague criticisms at him while giving your own one line poorly explained description of the point of non mining nodes.
Since then you haven't made any real points either. Mostly you've just thrown out insults. That seems to be an increasingly common tactic with some people on this sub. Are you by any chance the same person who keeps calling everyone "kiddo", as if that will somehow undermine what they are saying?
Lastly, I didn't say I was ignorant. I said I was not a Bitcoin expert. I have however been using and regularly reading about Bitcoin for 4-5 years now. Do you consider yourself to be a Bitcoin expert? Maybe you should ask Theymos to add some flair. People should really know that when you call them a "petulant child", "shitty little kid", or just "troll" this is coming from a truly great mind. An intellectual giant of the cryptocurrency world.

[This]( appears to be a neat summary of what went on a couple of years ago.
I think it's entirely plausible that someone in the crypto space would be against registering their charity as a charity. Why jump through all those hoops and ask permission to do good things.
I also think it's plausible for someone with a checkered past and a string of failed businesses to turn their life around and do good things.
The part I find suspicious is the combination of the two. Jason describes himself as a "serial entrepreneur and general asshole" for most of his life, then talks at length about his problems with drug addiction (instead of explaining what happened to all his failed companies). But he still doesn't see why he should maybe register as a charity and use the well established reporting procedures?

It clearly is a photoshop. 
The fact that WhalePanda claims not to have made it doesn't make things any better. At best that means he's just reposting a doctored image without realising.
If Roger's intent with his original tweet had been to mislead people about nullc's views it would have been incredibly dumb to include a link to the original article. Don't you think it's weirdly convenient that he provided all the evidence needed to refute what you think he was trying to do?
@_date: 2016-11-26 17:02:40
Roger provided a direct link. Anyone interested in the quote was one-click from reading a full article worth of context. Twitter's format lends itself to soundbites. If Roger had tried to piece together some paraphrasing to acknowledge the hypothetical 25 year context then he wouldn't have had room for the actual link, and people still would have attacked him for posting a pseudo quote.
Whomever produced the screenshot of Roger's tweet went out of their way to doctor the image and remove the context. You're saying that's somehow the same because anyone who wanted to see Roger's original tweet (which they had no reason to think would look any different), could just:  
* Go to Twitter.  
* Search for Roger's account.  
* Scroll through his many tweets and find the one that looked most similar to the photoshopped image.
Yes, that's clearly exactly the same as posting a direct like to the original source. /s
@_date: 2016-12-16 01:08:29
That's all very admirable, but your previous comment reads to me as an attempt to justify the witch-hunting that has happened here with regards to Roger, ViaBTC and SegWit. 
People were accusing those parties of "blocking SegWit" weeks before SegWit signalling even began. Now the miners have had about a month in which they could upgrade if the SegWit soft fork was really what they want. 
[Signalling]( seems to have plateaued at around 25%. While its still early days I would say that it's clearly inaccurate to suggest that Roger Ver is preventing SegWit from activating, but that is the picture people are trying to paint.
@_date: 2017-01-25 18:29:55
That's a really *really* long winded way of saying "yes, I think that miners are incredibly dumb and will be to shortsighted to recognise that their strategy is destroying the long term viability of their entire business". Why on earth do you think these people who invested hundreds of millions of dollars in datacenter scale mining operations are not going to understand the thing that you understand?
With the heavily centralised mining operations that we currently have it would be more sensible to worry about cartel style price-fixing, with a hash-power majority of miners colluding to keep blocks small and drive up fees.

What anyone technical said, Satoshi or not, 5-6-7 years ago is entirely relevant to addressing killerstorm's misleading comment.
In fact there's no real way to respond to his comment without citing specific things said by specific people 5-6-7 years ago.
You can keep trying to change or derail the conversation if you really want to, but Bitcoin absolutely *was* touted as a cheap and quick alternative to PayPal or credit cards. It was pitched that way by its creator, it was pitched that way by the early highly technical developers. Pretending it wasn't ever pitched that way is dishonest and misleading for the naive newbies who may be reading this sub.

You still didn't answer my question, and I asked mine first. 
So how do the developers voluntarily contributing to one open-source, GitHub hosted project (Bitcoin Unlimited) have anymore control over Bitcoin than the developers voluntarily contributing to another open-source, GitHub hosted project (Bitcoin Core)?
How would any of the Core developers be prevented from contributing? How would the BU developers force unwanted changes on the network? How would they be able to do anything that Bitcoin Core doesn't or can't currently do?
@_date: 2016-12-05 18:27:44
I'm referring to the scenario OP put forward. If every Bitcoin transaction cost $10-25 then the cost of buying and selling Bitcoin would be substantially greater than investing in non-physically delivered gold.
Even if Bitcoin has other benefits (which it does) people generally don't adopt more expensive alternatives to their current solutions.
@_date: 2016-11-28 20:06:09
I did read the thread, in fact I just linked to it in another reply. 
* Jeff raised the issue of the block size cap.  
* Satoshi said it could be raised "if we get closer to needing it".  
* Jeff and others pointed out that the change would require a full network upgrade which gets harder as adoption grows.  
* Satoshi proposed a conditional increase that would activate far in the future.


Because he disappeared two months after posting those messages. You know this, so again I think you are deliberately misleading people.


I confess. I can't find an explicit citation with Satoshi saying maxblocksize is a spam prevention measure.
He did however make many many posts at that time talking about preventing flooding of the blockchain. He also talked about the importance of always allowing some free transactions, and about raising both the maxblocksize limit and the amount of blockspace used for free transactions when those limits were reached.
Now, do you want to provide any sort of citation for your original comment about protecting nodes from miners or about establishing a fee market? Or do you want to admit that "as far as we can tell" you just stated your own rationale for keeping the blocksize small while implying that those were Satoshi's intentions?
@_date: 2016-11-17 22:58:12


That wasn't what you claimed, and therefore wasn't under debate. You claimed to "have heard rumors that Roger is attempting to deceive some business operators into some sort of agreement that is likely to benefit him in several ways".
That's not you accusing him of self promotion. It's bordering on you accusing him of fraud. But your rumour spreading was so deliberately vague I doubt it technically qualifies as libel.

There is no difference. The Bitcoin Unlimited developers would have no more power to force changes on the network or block changes that the network wanted than the Bitcoin Core developers currently have.
In the event of a hardfork happening, the Bitcoin Unlimited developers would mostly *be* Bitcoin Core developers who still wanted their hard work to be integrated into a relevant software implementation.
It's not a question of the network choosing one set of developers over another it's the network choosing to removing the scaling issue from the control of developers and putting it in the hands of the network where it always should have been.

Hardware scaling is where we actually take advantage of the year on year improvements in faster processors, higher capacity storage and RAM, faster internet connections. 
You know how today you can download an full HD copy of some 3-hour film in minutes, while 15 years ago I would leave my laptop hooked up to AOL overnight just to download a handful of MP3s on napster? That actually has much more to do with hardware scaling than it has to do with torrents.
Software scaling is making tweaks and optimisations to do more with the same available hardware resources. That's good. It's a good thing. Software devs shouldn't get lazy, but they also shouldn't get so bogged down in trying to do super clever things that they end up forcing those clever things as the only option for increased capacity.
Fifteen years from now syncing a few terabytes of blockchain is going to be as easy as downloading an MP3 of your favourite song. But with the way things are going Bitcoin will still have a 1MB (or maybe 1.7 with SegWit) blocksize and Luke-jr will still be telling people that's too big.

Bashco, at one point every comment - let alone post - that mentioned Bitcoin XT was auto moderated into oblivion. It was a deliberate shameless attempt to prevent people from hearing anything about a proposed change.
The single biggest "danger" from any hardfork is that out-of-the-loop users won't know that it's happening and will leave their nodes running some two years out of date implementation. 
That also means that the single easiest ways to block any hard fork from happening is Theymos wielding the power of his mini-media empire to block as much discussion as possible. That's exactly what he did.

If someone does release those logs showing Roger engaged in a discussion of the attendees and format then that would prove that his comment about not knowing until he arrived was false.
My comments about up-to 24 hours being enough time were un-tagged sarcasm. If someone asked me to take part in a publicly aired debate with less than a day to prepare I'd say no.

I think this is a beautiful example, but not for what you were trying to say. The vast overwhelming majority of people who invest in gold don't do so through physically delivered coins and bars. They buy some fraction of a bar that is (hopefully) sitting in some vault that they will never ever visit. That way they can buy and sell without losing 10% to middlemen.
If Bitcoin becomes as massively expensive as your hypothetical suggests then it won't be taking a chunk of the "gold market", it will only be taking a chunk of the "paranoid prepper physical gold coin market", which is tiny in comparison.

You know what real "manipulation" looks like? Several times over the last few years the US government has hit its national debt ceiling; a poorly thought out, completely artificial limit on borrowing. 
Each time that happened the Republicans used it as leverage to force through unpopular shit that no-one really wants but which serves their purposes.
That's manipulation. If they were just decent people doing what's right for the US they would never use the debt ceiling as a political tool. If there was any common sense going on they would probably have set a gradually raising ceiling that would keep pace with inflation/economic growth without any further votes. But that wouldn't serve their own manipulative self interests.
Keeping the artificial ceiling in place allows them to get their own way even if/when they are pushing for things the users don't want. Sorry, did I say users? I totally meant population. There are definitely no obvious parallels going on here.

A couple of years ago I was under the impression that everyone agreed that an actual blocksize increase would absolutely be necessary in order to support lightning network scaling. 
Today I am convinced that Bitcoin is dying a death from a thousand cuts. There are people who have publicly cemented themselves to the idea that hardforks are catastrophically impossible and any actual block size increase will drive every non-governmental node off the network. After all this arguing they can't now bring themselves to say: 


Can you imagine an alternate timeline where people said "that XT scaling plan looks way too aggressive. Here's a more conservative progression that will complement second layer solutions"? 
There still would have been some arguments/debate, but we could have spent all this time and energy coordinating a fork that would grow within the bounds of even the most pessimistic technological progress. 
Instead Mike Hearn was crucified for trying to destroy Bitcoin. Gavin has been driven away, Jeff Garzik has been ignored.

SegWit activation requires 95% of the hash power behind it. Signalling for SegWit activation doesn't start for another week and a half, so it currently has 0%.
A worthwhile read from bitcoincore.org:


And yet here we are, ravenously pursuing those who may or may not block activation of a change to the Bitcoin protocol which they have every right to block if they see fit.
**No-one is blocking anything yet and you should be more concerned about getting the first 90% onboard than trying to attack and shame people you think might maybe block the activation.**

Circle would've had a conflict of interest driving the Bitcoin protocol to implement features that Circle needed to make their own 2nd layer solutions work.

They can only do this if the blocksize limitations don't make plain Bitcoin ridiculously expensive to use. This is one of the arguments people have been making for the last two years. Artificially capping Block size at a stupidly low level forces users to adopt whatever scaling solutions they are presented with - or else stop using Bitcoin.
If the current situation keeps up "Bitcoin" five years from now will be unrecognisable to you, but will be exactly what a handful of developers (who all happen to work for/with blockstream) are planning. They aren't going to give you any options.

Who do you think listens to whalespeak and bitcoin scaling podcasts?
Perhaps this is why Roger gets invited to speak at these sorts of debates while you are stuck here arguing impotently.
I'm not a software developer or an expert cryptographer, so you're right that I'm not an expert in Bitcoin. I am however reasonably knowledgeable in the fields of genetics, statistics, epidemiology, since that's the area I work in. 
You know what's a common feature I've observed of people working in all these fields? The people spouting the most jargon and regurgitating things that they've read word for word generally aren't all that great. They are insecure and desperately trying to sound "smart". The people who are *real* experts are confident enough to know that most people know less than them and they work really hard to find simple ways of explaining things so that others can understand and learn.
Now which of those categories do you think you fall into?

The maxblocksize variable does not determine the size of blocks, it only sets an absolute cap. Within the scope of that cap the miners determine the actual block size. Why would the miners shoot themselves in the foot by completely removing any fee pressure? 
They wouldn't.


It comes down to a false dichotomy you've created. Most of the people who have spent the last couple of years arguing for the block size limit to be increases or removed also want to see second layer solutions. They want lightning networks, they actually do want SegWit. What they don't want is for on chain scaling to be deliberately hamstrung as a way to build pressure and push through second layer solutions. That's what we're seeing right now.

The trouble is that one moment you're saying it just needs a single part time programmer. The next moment you'll be asking why Bitcoin companies are still getting hacked.
Changetip took micro-transactions off-chain, which is arguably a good thing. To do that they needed to hold other people's bitcoins. Anyone holding other people's money should not be treating it as a part time job.
As for withdrawal fees, someone elsewhere in this thread already did the maths on that and it just doesn't add up. Not even for one part time programmer. I think a service like this could always expect tips to be paid forward numerous times or just left sitting dormant. I just withdrew my $5 and have no idea how many years it's been there. So, withdrawal fees will always be microscopic compared to the service they provided. 
Plus if they raised the fees any higher then some other company would start up providing the same service for free, and they would make their money from mining personal data.

Here are a couple of quotes from those cluesless non-technical people talking about Bitcoin:
[We should be able to at least match Paypal's average transaction rate...]( ~ Jeff Garzik
"Another option is to reduce the number of free transactions allowed per block before transaction fees are required.  Nodes only take so many KB of free transactions per block before they start requiring at least 0.01 transaction fee.
The threshold should probably be lower than it currently is.
[I don't think the threshold should ever be 0.  We should always allow at least some free transactions.]( ~ Satoshi Nakamoto
But Satoshi and Jeff probably just didn't understand how it works, right?
@_date: 2016-12-03 20:45:28
How about a slightly later comment from Jeff in [the same thread](




And yet here we are three and half years later. No real off chain scaling solutions are in place. Blocks are consistently full with fees rising suggesting that there now is a *need* to change the block size. 
Plus we have a cabal of developers offering a cabal of miners one solution: 


Even if Jeff really changed his views on blocksize that drastically (which I don't think is true) it would indeed still be retconning history to say that no-one technical supported the idea of very low cost PayPal scale transactions. Jeff is clearly a technical person. Jeff clearly stated that Bitcoin should scale to PayPal levels. Satoshi is clearly a technical person. Satoshi said there should always be some room for free transactions. 
Edit: what exactly do you think your quote from Satoshi about tyrannical users was supposed to mean?

We have to agree to disagree on your grasp of English. A "mature financial system" is a financial system that is mature. A "new mature financial system" is an oxymoron. 
You seem to be saying that bitcoin is a financial system for mature people, who are willing to take complete control and responsibility for their wealth. Thus we don't need banks anymore.
The problem with that argument is the "mature" people you are talking about make up a tiny fraction of the population. Most people want banks to make securing and managing their money easier. Most people need banks because they really aren't capable of securing their entire financial future on their own. Most people definitely want those banks to be regulated by lawyers and accountants who are much better placed to assess the security of those banks than the average user is.

Do you believe that Bitcoin Classic is dead because of this round table "deal"? If so that would really make me question the motives and sincerity of Adam Back and the other Core devs who attended. 
They apparently spent 18 hours negotiating what they would have to do to keep the miners from forking away from Core. In the end they have bought themselves at least another 5-6 months before hard fork code is scheduled to be released. If that deadline comes and goes with no movement then you're probably right; classic adoption will have stalled, Gavin will likely have moved on/given up, and the pissed off miners will have no viable option to turn to.
@_date: 2016-02-07 10:17:13
That's exactly the point I was very sarcastically trying to make. 
suggested that the "Core team" would disappear in a puff of smoke if there was a fork. That isn't remotely true or rational (and I only ever see it posted by 3-6 month old accounts set-up after this whole fork controversy began).
The developers who contribute to Core are free agents working on Bitcoin. In the event of a hard-fork occurring many of them wouldn't give a single flying fuck that the max blocksize variable had changed.

This is like the most dictionary definition of FUD I've ever seen. Are you proud of yourself for stooping to this ridiculous level?
The developers and proponents of Classic have never shown any indication of wanting to force a hardfork by any means necessary. They are simply presenting an option to the community and setting a bar that says that option will only activate when a super majority of the mining community wants it.

Forcing the entire ecosystem to what though? A slightly larger maximum block size. Potentially larger actual blocks if and when miners decide to increase their soft caps? In terms of what Bitcoin does and the way it works a cap increase doesn't really change anything.
SegWit makes substantial changes to the way transactions are represented. The changes may be good. The changes may even be fantastic. But they are still very substantial changes, and they are being implicitly forced through.
@_date: 2016-02-03 18:37:52

@_date: 2016-02-04 21:23:26
People have been telling me for years that Bitcoin works because people follow their own rational, selfish best interests. The scenario you are proposing violates that all over the place.
Miners won't force a hardfork unless they know they can sell their newly mined post fork coins on the exchanges. The biggest exchanges don't deal in alt-coins, so they aren't going to support separate trading of OldBitcoin and NewBitcoin.
So at the point where a fork is approaching, and during the grace period after it triggers, you would have clear support from the mining network and the exchanges for NewBitcoin. Post fork, OldBitcoin would only be tradable on low depth alt-exchanges. 
So I find it hard to believe that major hodlers-for-life would then dump their Bitcoins and walk away. They might threaten to. But when it comes down to the line it isn't in their rational self interest to abandon Bitcoin.

It's a shame there isn't a reverse version of RemindMe. 
RemindMe any point in the last 7 years: $0.10 is going to be considered a reasonable fee for Bitcoin transactions.
Back in the 2013 most wallets used a default fee, in some cases making it very difficult to adjust. So when the bubble hit and Bitcoins were suddenly ten times more valuable the fees hit $0.10-$0.15 for a while. People thought it was ridiculous and we're making shaming posts to try to force the wallet developers to update their settings.
This time the fees are dynamic. They have crept their way up little by little. But still the only reason people are saying ten cents is reasonable this time around is due to cognitive dissonance about the block size debate.

No. By definition of what I'm describing it would be near impossible to provide examples. But you'd have to be crazily simplistic to think that there haven't been many good products and inventions that came at the wrong time, or in the wrong political or social climate, and failed miserably.
If you want a fairly tempered example, ask yourself if Apple makes the best smart phones in the world? Probably not, right. 
But they're good and they charge less for them? Nope. They're generally considered to be quite overpriced.
So there are a number of companies out there making products that are better value for money, and in some cases explicitly better products. But they haven't been able to displace Apple's market. Because marketing and fashion and aspirational people.
A good product with a lot of financial backing and a talented marketing department still has a non-zero chance of failure. So if you start stripping away those things that chance increases substantially.
@_date: 2016-02-06 13:38:36
But in the event of a confidence rattling hard-fork how would the Core team keep paying the salaries of their developers, let alone renting those expensive offices where they all work?
What's that you say? They aren't actually a formal team with any sort of contractual obligations? They're really just a loose collection of developers contributing code and proposals to an open source repository? It would make virtually no difference whatsoever to most of them which repository they were submitting to?
@_date: 2016-02-01 18:39:48
It's an open source project. They aren't employed by the Bitcoin Core company.
*If* a Classic hardfork occurs those talented developers will have three choices:
1. Continue working on Bitcoin Core despite the fact it is no longer compatible with the Bitcoin blockchain.
2. Quit Bitcoin development and go work on something else they find interesting.
3. Clone the Classic repo and start working on that instead. It will be 99.9% identical to the code they were previously working on.
Some of the most publicly visible Core devs have very firmly nailed their colours to the 1Mb flag pole. So I can see them taking option two to save face. But Core has lots of contributors and most of them have never been particularly outspoken on the blocksize issue.
Just in case you were about to say it; signing the roadmap meant that they supported that series of events as an acceptable way forward. It *does not mean* that they will drop tools and say "fuck you Bitcoin community" if the fork occurs.

I think it would be much more useful and conclusive if these companies had their round table, agreed their strategy and then released official statements through their own websites.

Total transaction fees per block have more than doubled in the last 6 months: 
So maybe fees have stayed the same and transaction volume has doubled? If that's the case we should probably increase capacity pretty fucking quickly.
But that's not it. Transaction volume has increase a little in that time and fees have doubled. With capacity artificially fixed the fees will keep going up and Bitcoin will become useless for low value transactions. But you will still be here telling people:

At one time you could also buy guns and Ross (or DPR if you prefer) was defending the sale of cyanide because theoretically it could have uses other than the obvious "I want to kill someone" one.

The historic highs are not an accurate comparison and you damn well know it!
In 2013 default fees were hard baked into wallets. The bubble increase Bitcoin prices and therefore fees by about ten-fold in under a month. Everyone involved at the time thought that $0.10 was insanely expensive for a Bitcoin transaction, and wallets quickly reduced their defaults back down to one or two pennies.
The current fees are based on what people need to pay to get their transactions confirmed in a reasonable time. i.e. Bitcoin transactions have become several times more expensive over the last few months than they were ever intended to be.

What proportion of total transaction volume do you believe is malicious spam designed to fill blocks? Because no, you wouldn't need twice as many to fill 2MB blocks. If current 1MB blocks are 80% "real" transactions + 20% spam it would cost 6 times as much to fill 2MB blocks. If it's 90% vs. 10% then it would cost 11 times as much.

It does change what you were saying. You're describing what you believe to be an attack against the network that results in long wait times and higher fees. I'm pointing out that even the simplest blocksize doubling would make that attack many times more expensive to carry out.
I've spent four years hearing about how anti-fragile Bitcoin is, how it can adapt to any threat, how alt-coins don't matter because Bitcoin can easily adopt any desirable features they develop. 
I've spent the last year and a half hearing that we can't increase the max block size because a small number of egotistical developers take it as a personal insult to their more convoluted scaling ideas.

In theory, yes. 
In practice you could shut down a handful of big mining datacenters in China and instantly send average block confirmation times from 10 minutes to an hour or two. 
Until the difficulty retargetted you would see massive transaction backlogs. To have a good chance of getting your trasaction confirmed the same day you would have to outbid every other user on fees, so using Bitcoin would likely get very expensive very quickly.
Plus the retargetting happens every 2016 blocks not necessarily every two weeks. So with block times of an hour or two the situation could persist for 3-6 months.

@_date: 2015-04-21 06:59:52
If you want a real answer: Bank deposits in Cyprus were insured by the government upto a value of €100k. The banks were failing meaning that people with more than €100k were going to lose it, and the government would be on the hook for all the deposits below that threshold.
So as an alternative they applied a one-off tax on deposits over €100k (I.e. The money that was about to be lost entirely), which allowed the banks to keep functioning. Therefore the insurance on deposits below €100k did not have to be paid.
It wasn't what was supposed to happen. The banks were supposed to fail, the deposit insurance was supposed to pay out, and the free market was supposed to keep on rolling. But despite the way people in this sub try to frame it, the bail in was a much better outcome for absolutely everyone who was directly involved.

Genuine question: Do you not see anything wrong with this scenario from an economic viewpoint? It's almost impossible to ever prove that bitcoins have been lost, we just have to take people's word for it.
If 99.999% of all bitcoins lapsed into apparently permanent inactivity would the remaining 0.001% really expand in value to service the bitcoin economy? Or, would people lose faith in the value of bitcoins because of the prospect that one of many unknown entities out their holds the power to completely crash the value at any given moment?
That's obviously an extremely exaggerated scenario, but I think it's one of the features of inflation vs deflation that a lot of people in this sub don't understand.

Exactly. Even if there were just a handful if bitcoins in active circulation those coins (with a shift of the decimal place) would be able to service all global commerce. 
Of course at that point one bitcoin would be worth the equivalent of trillions of dollars, and therefore early adopters who still held thousands of bitcoins would nominally posses more wealth than the entire global economy. So I guess they wouldn't be able to spend that wealth without causing catastrophic economic collapse...

OP is exaggerating. He's citing every conceivable thing people could possibly be asked to do rather than the standard user experience that most people have.
It doesn't do anyone any favours to circle jerk like that. I've tried telling my friends before that with bitcoin your payments can't be blocked. Their response? "I've never had any payments blocked", and they're probably right.
If people want to treat bitcoin as a battlefield then they should keep in my that the famous phrase is "know your enemy", not "make up a bunch of exaggerated bullshit about your enemy and explain how you are better than that fictionalised enemy".

A blockchain whose mining was controlled by a single party (government, company) would just be a database.
A blockchain with closed but distributed mining could work. Say 1000 participants (governments, banks, credit card companies, Facebook) each agreed to contribute equal computing power to the network. 
There would be no arms race to gain more hashing power because there is nothing to gain by doing so. There would be no pooled mining because there is no reason to try and average out you returns. The chances of one participant mining several blocks in a row would be billions to one, and achieving collusion between enough miners to screw with the blockchain would be insanely difficult because the participants are geographically and politically dispersed. 
The only downside to this proposition is that it would still leave economic control in the hands of governments banks and major corporations. But if people here can take off their libertarian hats for a second they'll see that most people are ok with that.

This is exactly the problem I have with this proposal. We can't know when a large spike in adoption might happen. This elastic proposal only allows for a 5% adjustment from one fortnight to the next, and the adjustments will be downwards during quiet periods. A major spike in usage under this model would cripple the network and make bitcoin look unusable.
The BIP101 proposal doesn't actually change how big the blocks will be, it changes how big they *can be* gradually over time. It works on the principle that technology will advance over time and the cost of running a bitcoin node will therefore stay roughly the same despite large growth in transactions.
@_date: 2015-04-24 06:57:29


That's what I mean about people not understanding this feature of inflationary currency. If someone in 1915 stashes away a million dollars in cash, to be paid out to their great-grandchild 100 years later, that doesn't matter. What was once a huge sum of money in now just a large sum. 
Deflation means going the other way, it means the longer the uncertainty continues the more concerning it becomes. Satoshi's suggested ~1million bitcoins today is a very nice chunk of change. 1million bitcoins in 100 years could be a globally destabilising amount of money, and there still won't be any way to prove that they are lost. That is a bug, not a feature.

I would say that the blocksize limit should change in a way that's appropriate for increasing technological capacity. As I said; any adaptive algorithm is potentially gameable. 
Your proposal allows a truly committed and heavily resourced attached to spam their heart out filling 50.1% of blocks in any given period - continually ramping up the block cap by 5% per fortnight. BIP101 doesn't.
Your proposal means that a sudden major influx of new users, or a sudden increase in usage by existing holders, would grind confirmation times to a halt while the cap size algorithm slowly caught up. BIP101 doesn't.
Why does your proposal, and BIP100 need to allow for the cap to be reduced back down?

All you need to do is keep your private keys secret, but also secure. 
I just moved house. In one of the many boxes stacked around me is a stack of paper wallets - unless that box got left in the moving van. 
But even if it did no one can take the bitcoins because I used bip38 encryption which is great - unless I forget the password.
I also have backups of those paper wallets in a truecrypt volume stored on a cloud drive. That should be good so long as I trust truecrypt and don't forget the password for that volume, and don't forget the bip38 password.
In contrast the rest of my money is secured in bank accounts and brokerage accounts operated by centralised service providers. You may think I'm some brainwashed statist, but I feel a lot more confident about ongoing security and access to the money in my bank account than I do about my bitcoins, and that's after using bitcoin for over 2 years.

The drugs comment was both funny (reddit loves jokes) and accurate. 
pluribusblanks comment is mostly good but not entirely accurate. Bitcoin allows you to send bitcoin to anyone over the internet. Whether that qualifies as money really depends on whether they can spend it on stuff or not. 
Most people who currently receive bitcoin - through remittance services or payment for stuff - convert it to local money, which requires the cooperation or permission from a company or bank.
So yes, it was an answer that speaks to the hopes of everyone involved in bitcoin. But it also whitewashes the way bitcoin is actually being used.

I'd have to disagree with this. Disruption is temporary and consolidation tends to happen again because there are always advantages to scale. There are doubtless hundreds of streaming music services and legal download sites, but ask a hundred strangers on the street and almost all of them will name Spotify, Pandora, iTunes.

It's obviously his own business what he does with his bitcoins. But when an extremely long term hodler starts cashing out bitcoins he has held onto for the last 6 years to buy amazon credit and pay off part of his mortgage... That implies certain things. One of those things is that he expects the return on bitcoin in the next year/few years to be less than the interest on his mortgage.

I think it's less a case of learning and more a case of over extrapolation. The ETH fork had two types of people with a vested interest in splitting the chain or preventing the fork altogether.
1. The DAO hacker(s) and everyone they had sent stolen ETH to. That was the whole point of the fork, to move $50 million of value from some people to other people. You think that might be an incentive for them to act?
2. People who are dead set against a Bitcoin hard fork and really *really* didn't want to see a successful seamless demonstration by the Ethereum network.
I know the second one sounds like conspiracy nonsense (and thus fits this thread quite well), but it was a bit odd how the Ethereum fork seemed to go just fine at first, then people resurrected the old chain for no sensible reason.

Would you trust a blockchain where mining was equally distributed between 10 banks/major companies? Probably not. What about 100, or 1000? Probably still no, because a closed system like that still wouldn't be truely decentralised. But you know what; it would be a fuck-ton more decentralised than the bitcoin network actually is. 
We have mining pools that put a large chunk of all hashing power temporarily in the hands of single random interenet strangers. We have ASIC datacentres constantly pushing the mining efficiency to the limit and leaving ordinary miners the choice of turning off their equipment or mining at a loss "out of the kindness of their own hearts".
For years the network has been getting more and more centralised. It really doesn't matter at this point what the intention was, the reality is that a small consortium of businesses could put together a more distributed, more decentralised network.

What if the miners don't support it for technical reasons? Who are you to decide what is a technical reason and what is a "dumb political reason"? 
Surely the activation threshold is a necessary requirement to make sure the soft fork only goes ahead when some form of "consensus" has been reached and it is not "contentious"? 
Gavin spent a long time trying to point out that an activation threshold of 75% was sensible because it meant no single pool would be able to veto necessary changes. Many other people spent a lot of time arguing with that and insisting that a much higher threshold was necessary.

What real issues do we really have at 1MB?
I know that according to the bitfury paper nodes will be dropping like flies even without an increase, but I think that's more of an adoption issue than a technical one. 
The paper works on the assumption that a 4Gb of RAM requirement will drive a quarter of the nodes away, based on surveying steam user's systems. But people who actually care enough to run a full node in the first place are not going to be put off by a £20 upgrade. The same is almost certainly true for storage space as well.
I know the dream is to hook up a raspberry pi to a dial-up connection and still cope with a global financial ledger. But maybe we should accept that - no matter what tweaks and improvements are made - running a full node is going to require a decent computer, not the sort of 2009 laptop that a lot of steam users apparently still have (actually my 2009 MacBook already has 8Gb of ram anyway. So they're really polling some relics in that survey).

Can you honestly not see that a 95% threshold - particularly when there are multiple competing proposals - is effectively the same as saying "let's do nothing". 
You can fail to reach 95% because a single influential player disagrees with the proposal. You can fail to reach 95% because a malicious actor is actively blocking the move in order to hurt bitcoin. You can fail to reach 95% simply because not everyone is paying close enough attention!

Actually it more likely means that faster mining hardware is coming online, not necessarily more, because the slower less efficient hardware gets retired.

See, this sort of shifting goal posts is why people were asking for evidence in the first place. The paper linked, relinked, and linked again, highlights RAM as the biggest issue. Storage is not a bottleneck, mostly because you don't really need to have the entire blockchain stored on SSD. The problem *you're* choosing to highlight is one you have actively created for yourself.


I'm not sure I follow this part. There's no reason to think lightning network or any other second layer solution is going to reduce on chain transactions to a fraction of capacity. If current blocks are smothering your overpriced storage then neither SegWit nor Lightning can save you from that.

There's really nothing wrong with credit/debt when it's provided to credit worthy individuals and businesses. 
I'm in my early 30s with a good job and no history of financial problems. It's in my bank's interest to give me a secured loan against the house I want to buy, and it's in my interest to borrow money and buy it now rather than desperately saving for the next 10 years so I can buy it outright. Why would we stop that? 
As for the other stuff. My spare bitcoin cash is on a phone app, yes. But my bitcoin savings are on encrypted paper wallets that would take time to dig out and decrypt, and my only experience buying shares through bitcoin is 0.1BTC of Neo &amp; Bee via Havelock. So that's not quite the same as whipping out my phone and trading bluechips.

You're talking about two different things. 
A rights issue is when new shares are created and offered for sale in order to raise additional capital for the company. This dilutes the holdings of existing share holders and so is only done when the company is in dire financial trouble. 
A stock split is when every share is split into two or more new shares. But those new shares are automatically owned by whomever owned the old shares. The company doesn't get any new money from doing that, and the shareholders still posses the same proportion of the company as they did before the split.

Market economies can still be dynamic with a reasonably stable unit of currency. House prices, equity prices, commodity prices etc can all move in relation to one another while the currency value stays relatively stable. 
Currencies are designed to be a stable intermediate to lubricate the trade between other "stuff", they aren't supposed to be a speculative investment themselves, that's just an undesirable product of how people use them. 


In what way? Anywhere but that would be a very contraversial statement, and you aren't bothering to justify or explain it in any way because you know the free-market anarchist posse is going to upvote you regardless. 
A currency with no controls means bigger booms and deeper busts. That's not a universally bad thing. Rich people love boom and bust cycles. They can ride the waves and get proportionally richer in both directions. But for the billions of working class people in the world recession mean unemployment and poverty.

I'm not talking about a farmer striking oil or a crypto enthusiast making a lucky bet on bitcoin, because both of those people are going to "cash out" and enjoy their money in a reasonable timeframe. I'm talking about a government entity that can afford to sit on their coins for generations.
The lost coin issue that you raised means that their share of the bitcoin economy would gradually increase far beyond the 5%-7% I quoted above. They wouldn't simply be rich at that point. They would be so unimaginably rich that the free market you mention simply would simply not exist.

Ok, i've been here a couple of years and have plenty of good things to say about bitcoin. But I still think he's got a valid point. 
Gold didn't go straight from worthless lump of metal to long term store of value. It was valued as a shiny thing that people wanted, and therefore used in trade, and therefore developed a relatively stable long term value. 
Some super expensive wines are a good store of value despite the fact they're most likely undrinkable. But that doesn't mean I can ferment up a batch and say "this is worth $1000 a bottle now". They have to gain value through being good wine that people buy to drink in the first instance. 
By that same merit, bitcoin can't go from experimental open source computer protocol to long term store of value, unless it gains usage as a currency inbetween.

Because the bank/exchange is the money service business in that transaction. They are licensed. They have your details on file. They jump through all the regulatory hoops so you don't have to.
When you take the business out of the equation and go customer to customer, neither party is going to take the necessary steps to identify who their counter-party is.

There are numerous public projects like SETI or folding where people donate their computer resources and electricity with nothing to gain.

Actually my main point was that the 3% fee is a myth, at least as far as the UK is concerned. The upper estimate of merchant CC fees here is 0.8%.
People up and down this thread are saying "you can't solve this with regulation, they'll just push the fees on consumers instead". But I'm a consumer, I have multiple credit cards with zero subscription fees, zero transaction fees, and reward points. 
The CC companies charge upto 0.8% to merchants, they charge interest when people don't pay off their bills in full, and they still make huge profits.

It's logical to assume that data centre outfits located in regions with low electricity costs get greater efficiency for any computing application even without the ASIC effect.

The idea that any large companies/institutions are looking at bitcoin and thinking "Wow, thats amazing, but we can't use it because of the currently limited transaction capacity" is ludicrous. 
The current level of network traffic does not cause a problem, there is no reason to think there will be a sudden explosion in user adoption that would cause us to hit the limit.

It might be a cultural distinction. Here in the UK verification usually consists of two parts. 
1. Identity. i.e. passport or drivers licence. 
2. Address. i.e. bank statement or utility bill. 
The address verification document usually has to be dated within the last 3 months, to prove that you live there now rather than have lived there at some point. 
In theory UK drivers licences are supposed to be registered to your current address, but in practice mine still lists my parents address that I moved out of 14 years ago. So most financial companies here wouldn't accept drivers licence as both identity and address proof.

Yeah, and people who think that blockchain technology is a useful technological advancement would also gain an indirect and intangible reward from supporting that system. 
I think the big mental block people have on this comes from the fact that bitcoin miners currently get paid. 
When bitcoin launched the miners recieved digital tokens worth no more than reddit upvotes, and yet they still mined. Then bitcoins took on monetary value and the miners began getting paid to mine. Now the idea of doing something for free that people used to get paid for seems crazy. 
If reddit started paying people small amounts for making popular submissions, i'm certain the volume of submissions would increase. But that doesn't mean people won't submit content to reddit without getting paid.

You aren't an outsider. You are a paid employee of Blockstream, a company whose founders have clearly been at odds with Gavin over block size issues for a considerable length of time.
Gavin's commit access was supposedly removed because of concerns that his blog and possibly other accounts may have been hacked. He has confirmed that they were not, so the access should clearly be reinstated.
If Peter Todd had suggested removing Gavin's access without the pretence of suggesting that Gavin had been hacked; we would have collectively told him to STFU. 
If Wladimir had just randomly booted Gavin one day there would clearly have been a whole lot of questions and suspicion from the community about why that was necessary.
Yet now that it's been done - under false assumptions - you are arguing that Gavin should have to earn back the access that was already his. 
Edit to let people take a look at [the last time Peter Todd suggested removing Gavin's access]( from 8 months ago. If you want to see the comments supporting that proposal they are at the bottom, buried in downvotes, because Peter Todd is - and always has been - a troll.

Millions of people plowing their money into bitcoin would drive the price up massively. Massively increasing prices would attract lots of speculative money driving the price up even more massively. 
When the rapidly expanding bubble finally plateaued all those speculators would sell to realise their gains. The price would crash. Greek savers would panic and join in the selling. 
When the dust finally settled maybe bitcoin would be worth ten times or a hundred times what it is today. But that wouldn't mean jack shit to the millions of people who just watched half their life savings disappear.
This is why simple supply and demand isn't a very good way to manage a currency.

The difference between all those things and bitcoin, and the reason why some people are understandably sceptical, is that bitcoin users have a clear vested financial interest in promoting it's use. 
Your friend tells you to try out email because it's so much faster and easier than sending a letter; you have no reason to question that. The only thing they have to gain is an easier avenue of communication with you.
When bitcoiners advocate the use of bitcoin they are unavoidably saying "Hey man, try this cool new thing that makes me richer the more people use it". Thus bitcoiners have a reason to skew the facts. To focus on the positives and downplay any problems. It doesn't even have to be conscious.

No, they don't. Every reputation system has problems. 
Problem 1 is that new users start out with zero reputation. So there is no way to ensure that person isn't a scammer or just unreliable. Because of that risk, new people would basically have to work for free until they had built up enough good feedback. That means your system is going to have an ongoing and increasing bias against new workers. 
Problem 2 is that you're allowing user submitted feedback in a highly competitive environment. People can and will deliberatley sabotage the ratings for competitors, and deliberately inflate their own rating. It happens with restaurants, it happens with hotels, it will happen here too.

The problem is that it is still a dream at the moment. 
They can work out what percentage of their profit is lost in chargebacks, fees, admin costs. But then they have to work out what the actual rather than hypothetical savings would be from using bitcoins. It's not 2-3%. It only becomes 2-3% when the whole world switches to universal bitcoin usage. 
At the moment it's probably more like 0.02-0.03% because they would only expect 1% of sales to happen through bitcoin. 


As for that, I think you already know the arguments for why small businesses, who are trying to scrape an extra 1% profit margin, can't afford to gamble on bitcoins nearly constant price fluctuations.

From the perspective of wordpress chaturbate or whoever the meaningful definition of "users" is not holders but actual users, which they can measure by their own usage metrics having offered bitcoin payments for a period of time. 
The guy from wordpress said they only removed the option because they are making changes to their payments system, and they may well reintroduce bitcoin in due time. But if a lot of places start withdrawing the option, that really isn't saying good things about the actual usage level of bitcoin.

So bitcoin doesn't experience volatility when use adoption is increasing? Of course it does. It's just volatile in a way that rewards holders.
The flaw they are referring to is the inability to modulate supply in response to variable demand. Demand for a currency is always going to vary in response to a number of outside forces, this will happen even if the bitcoin economy becomes huge. Varied demand + fixed supply = volatility and volatility is not a desirable feature for a currency.

Satoshi exist to... no-one knows because no-one knows who or what Satoshi is or what his future intentions may be. 
That's why Satoshi having a finite capacity to fuck-up the bitcoin economy is more dangerous than a central bank having an infinite capacity to fuck-up the fiat economy.

Of course someone could point a gun at me and force me to transfer all my savings to them via internet banking. But they wouldn't, because bank to bank transactions are easily identifiable and potentially reversable. So in that context your bank savings are more secure than your bitcoins.

I still don't see how you're addressing the point I made? Someone steals my credit cards and beats the pin numbers out of me; I call the issuer and have the cards and the transactions cancelled. That doesn't work with bitcoin.

I can't tell if you're just trolling me or what? That video has absolutely nothing to do with the fact that stolen credit cards can be cancelled and fraudulent transactions can be reversed. 
Basically the video says that if you're an irresponsible idiot who gets a credit card without understanding what it is; you can get into debt. No shit Sherlock.

No. They'd be precisely the sort of person who keeps their entire life savings in a hosted wallet with a phone app that doesn't require a password.

For bitcoins to be in an open sell offer the exchange needs to be able to access those bitcoins without the customers key. Otherwise a customer could place an open order but then refuse to sign-off when the order is met.
So any system that requires the customer to sign-off on transactions is only useable for coins that are "on deposit" but not being actively traded. The exchanges don't have any incentive in providing that sort of service. 
@_date: 2015-02-22 13:40:14
Sure, but it's telling that your first instinct for how to solve this security issue involves a third party organisation that will require identity verification and some form of payment to provide that service. Basically it's not a bank, but it's one step back towards the concept of a bank. 
My point isn't to suggest that bitcoin isn't useful or a valid option for those that understand what they are getting into. But I think the youthful skew of bitcoin users leads to somewhat eurphoric naivety. There is no such thing as a free lunch, and a system that provides some great benefits over the status quo is always going to have some drawbacks too. OP is asking us to ignore/downvote anyone who dares mention one of those drawbacks.

If there really were paid anti-bitcoin shills around they would be much more subtle than this. They'd make reasonable sounding critisisms of the protocol, the economics, and the ongoing hurdles to mass adoption.

The best form of payment when buying expensive things is a credit card. Not just because of the cashback/rewards points they may give you, but because they are jointly liable if there is a problem with the stuff you buy.

That's true, but it's also true that the second major section of the Visa page is titled "Criticisms and controversy".

It isn't illegal, nor is it fraud. Show me the terms and conditions for your exchange that say the money you deposit continues to be yours and will be returned to you even in the event of bankruptcy? Show me that section from your banks terms and conditions? It isn't there. The difference is that many people are willing to trust an FDIC insured multibillion dollar licensed bank to run a fractional reserve. They don't put the same trust in Bitstamp or OkCoin, so the order books remain shallow.

I think this is a problem. Everytime you buy up a bitcoin, stick it on a paper wallet, and bury it in the garden, you reduce the liquidity in the market; yes. But reducing the liquidity doesn't automatically mean the price is going to go upwards. It just means the price is going to be more volatile. 
Now that it's just as easy to short bitcoin as it is to buy them, and now that "big money" people are getting involved; there is huge money to be made pumping and crashing the market. The proud horders and hodlers of bitcoin (of which I am one) actually just make the market more appealing to speculative day traders, who don't care whether bitcoin is going up or down just so long as it is moving. 
@_date: 2015-02-07 09:09:34
But bitcoin is also difficult to keep completely secure.
The reason I keep my savings in a bank rather than a floor safe has a little to do with inflation and interest rates, and a little to do with ease of use, and a lot to do with wanting to defer responsibility for the safety of my money to a large regulated and insured third party.
People will use "bitcoin banks", and those banks will be able to run fractional reserves.

It's a meaningless technicality when the topic of conversation is transaction fees and speeds. We're talking about user experience, so the layers of backroom stuff that has to happen isn't important. What's important is how long my transaction takes and how much it costs.

No, it reduces volatility. The gold price gets driven up by speculative investment, just like bitcoin. But unlike bitcoin the gold production rate increases at higher values. That serves to rebalance the supply vs. demand and constrains the height of the bubble.
Sure, the mining companies are at the mercy of rising and falling prices. But the range of gold prices is constrained, not amplified, by this process.

The multi-signature feature is very cool, and will allow for a lot of applications. But in this specific example I think it face a big problem. The service you're describing would have to charge fees for helping you secure your money. People (at least where I live) are not used to paying for that. They are used to banks paying them interest, and historically that interest beat inflation. 
So the bitcoin solution to this problem will be unpalatable to most people (except those counting on the end of western civilisation).

Your initial post suggested people shouldn't use credit cards or cash because of the risk of violent theft. If that was really an attempt at reductio ad absurdum, then it fell flat.
The argument doesn't work for credit cards because of the third party protection provided by the card issuer, and it's not really absurd for cash in the sense that people really *shouldn't* carry around most of their worldly wealth in cash. 
The car example is perhaps a good absurd example, because cars and money aren't in any way the same thing. So congratulations, you made a pointlessly absurd arguement.

I don't know the history of X25 or any other networking protocols. But the analogy you are making could just as easily be argued for why bitcoin might fail.  


If something being "good enough" and having a substantial network effect means it will continue to dominate, then bitcoin has a big problem. 
Despite the highly concentrated horror stories people tell in forums; PayPal is "good enough" for the vast majority of transactions, and it has hundreds of times as many users as bitcoin. 
Fiat currency in general is "good enough" for most of the people you and I know, and collectively it's network effect is absolute. 
Either bitcoin could fail due to the massive network effect of the existing financial industry. Or bitcoin could fail because a "better" digital currency overtakes it.

Have you considered that there is no way to prove coins are lost? 
Say for the sake of argument that Satoshi really is the NSA. If Satoshi has ~1 million coins now, that's about 7% of all currently mined bitcoins and about 4.8% of all possible bitcoins. But no one cares because those coins are lost, right?
Now time goes on and other coins really are lost. Millions of them, a little at a time over a hundred years. It doesn't matter because the value of bitcoins increases, the decimal point gets moved, and people continue to not care about Satoshi's million coins. Then they move.
For the first time in a hundred years a few coins from that lost million move, and it becomes apparent that whomever or whatever "Satoshi" was, they have control over a vast proportion of all the bitcoin in existence.

This is true. It's likely that all bitcoin brokers and exchanges do (or will) trace your transactions after you withdraw, because information on how and where people spend money is valuable. 


Coinbase acts as a broker, so in periods of high volatility their stockpiles of bitcoins or fiat currency will skew in one direction or the other exposing them to too much risk. That's why they end up cancelling orders.

If you don't understand why the rest of your argument is incorrect I'd suggest you need more than a Reddit conversation to learn. 
Take a look at what happened in the 2008 recession, or any recession for that matter. Capital flight to gold and other safe havens doesn't just result in money changing hands and everything being unicorns and rainbows.

Gavin and Brian were actually right though weren't they. The fork did go smoothly and something like 99% of the Ethereum network followed the fork. 
It was only after people started citing the successful fork as yet more evidence that Core is dragging its feet that the minority (microscopic) chain started getting support again.
Call me crazy but I'm a little suspicious that a bunch of genuine Ethereum players would willingly fork and then change their minds a day later. But it sure is convenient for the narrative of Theymos and Maxwell *et al* that the dead chain miraculously came back to life.

The only exchange multisig setup I've heard about is 2/3 with customer, exchange and 3rd party (bitgo I think) having keys. That means the exchange (or employee of) and bitgo (or employee of) can still conspire to steal customer funds.
The alternative would be 2/2 so the customer has to validate any transaction. There is absolutely no point in the exchange providing this sort of service since they take on some responsibility for the funds, while not having access to them.

This is such an abstract attempt at an explanation. It's full on mental gymnastics to suggest that regulators are going to repay Coinbase's support of bigger blocks because you reckon that will lead to centralisation and that the centralisation will benefit the regulators.


Again. Keeping blocks small forces people to send and recieve transactions through third parties. Increasing block sizes explicitly and indisputably makes it easier to send transactions *on-chain*. There is no ridiculous way you can spin this the other way around.

Storage space and bandwidth both increase over time, and are likely to do so in the future.

You said it yourself; there was a lot of demand for gold as a currency in the past. Gold became a store of value through thousands of years of use. People didn't just get together one day and say "let's all agree that gold is valuable so that we can store our wealth in it". That had to happen organically over time. 
In the same way, bitcoin is not going to go from computer protocol to trillion dollar store of value without an intermediate step.

At one end of the spectrum you have governments, central banks, law enforcement etc, who all think these features are very very useful. At the other end of the spectrum you have people who want total control/financial freedom. But inbetween is a massive group called the general public. Those people are actually fine with a central entity having those powers. 
That's why I don't think it's crazy to think a government issued crypto currency would gain acceptance. Sure, not many people from would touch it. But if the value were stable (pegged to local currency), and people could use it to transact person to person with no paypal/bank intermediate. Then I think it would be popular.

Saving for retirement is a long term investment. Short term volatility is expected and acceptable for those purposes. 
Currency is the thing you get in your paycheque on the 1st and use to pay your bills two weeks later. For those purposes you want something that will remain fairly stable over the short term.
Note that people got pretty pissy when the Ruble rapidly lost value. But people also got pissy when the Swiss Franc suddenly gained value. There were winners and losers on both sides, but currency isn't meant to be a game, it's meant to be a stable medium of exchange.

So...you're saying this is actually good news? 
You think that once people have gotten used to sending small amount of money to their friends, fee-free, with a function that's neatly integrated into the messenger app they already use; that they will then want to switch to a system that does require fees, uses an unfamiliar currency, and is not integrated into their messenger app?

That's not how it works. That's not how any of this works. 
Bitcoins value (in relation to USD, GBP, Gold, Silver, or hotel rooms) is variable and driven by supply and demand. It doesn't matter how many lotteries or other services start operating at a fixed BTC cost, the value is still going to be driven up when lots of new users buy bitcoins, and is going to plunge when major holders "cash out". 
Any business, even a lottery, that tries to ignore the changing value of bitcoins is going to see huge swings in customers, and that's not a good business model.

It's true that in our current system the rich tend to get richer, but that's because they have access to investment opportunities that poor people can't get. They are able to buy up limited resources, like housing, and rent them back to the poor people who need them. They can stick their huge pot of wealth in a diversified basket of investments and live off a fraction of the income, while watching the overall value increase above the rate of inflation. 
The difference is that with a deflationary currency, they don't need to do any of that. They get richer just by having money. They don't need to make any investments or risk any of their capital. They can just sit back and chill, spending a little of their wealth each year but watching the remainder increase in value proportionally with global growth.

Fiat currency is ubiquitous. All the businesses use it, all the people have it. So it would be crazy if people rejected the thing they already use because of the actions of one company, or even an entire sector of business.

Automatic doublings *could* be a bad idea if they outpace technological improvements. In which case it would take a hard fork to remove the auto-doubling aspect, and hard forks are difficult. That's what could happen. 
But if the block size is simply increased, by hard fork, to a larger fixed amount (say 20MB), what definitely *will* happen is we will have to increase it, by hard fork, again in the future.
Also, don't "sigh" at people. It's a very unproductive way to have a conversation. No one thinks Moore's law is a literal law of the universe, but it is very consistent with the way things have developed for a few decades now.

I'm not sure what you guys are arguing about. Both your charts show the same thing: zero growth in the value of transactions over the last year, maybe ever 18 months. 
Given that the number of transactions has apparently increased steadily, but the total value of transactions has remained the same, we can deduce that the average transaction value is steadily decreasing. 
That could be the result of people buying low value stuff through newly adopting outlets like Microsoft. But it would also be consistent with the idea of certain bitcoiners breaking up their stash into smaller and smaller amounts spread across increasing numbers of active addresses.

This is much more important. With enough mixing and mingling the exact history of one particular "bitcoin" becomes impossible to identify. 
I think the argument that Crytolution made is far less strong than that. The Philippine family will absolutely care if they receive tainted bitcoins and are unable to use them to pay the electricity bill. The electricity company will care if the Philippine government tell them to care. And the Philippine government might well do that if they are put under pressure by other world governments to help stamp out "bitcoin crime".

Or the pile is *very big* and the economy is growing a small amount. The point is simply that a deflationary currency rewards the very rich for doing nothing, making no investments, taking no risk. 
So, no, my hypothetical doesn't presuppose an incredibly productive economy and even if it did that still wouldn't matter, because a portion of that productivity would still be benefitting people who are doing absolutely nothing. It's the very definition of the rich getting richer for no reason whatsoever.

In a system around bitcoin, if *all* the rich just sit on their money, then there are no investments, no growth, and they don't get richer.

You're taking the current system that requires active participation at an individual level, and replacing it with a system susceptible to game-theory style shenanigans.

The above "tophernator's law" would make people much more comfortable about leaving funds on deposit with exchanges. Those funds - when placed in open limit orders - would add to the market depth making it substantially harder for large traders to manipulate the exchange rate up and down triggering margin calls and big price swings. 
The reduced volatility would make it easier for businesses to justify keeping funds in bitcoin rather than insta-converting through payment processors. That would allow them to promote further commercial adoption by offering to pay suppliers in bitcoin, and so on and so forth. 
It is, in my humble opinion, a hypothetical law that would benefit users of bitcoin and promote growth of the bitcoin ecosystem. The only cost is preventing people who shouldn't be running financial exchanges from running financial exchanges.

While those examples would be exaggerated ridiculousness, the principle objection would be sound. I think the majority of the general public and subscribers would agree that having wealthy corporations or individuals buying up politicians is a bad thing.

OP posted an art project **and a title loaded with political ideology**, while basically simplifying Zimbabwe's complex history and problems down to central bank money printing.
I pointed out that he was massively oversimplifying that complex situation and pointing at a symptom rather than a cause. Then I gave a single example of an actual root cause and the knock-on effects it had. 
I didn't claim that the example I gave was the entire complete explanation and I wasn't attempting to write an academic paper on the topic, so saying I left out X or Y is redundant.
I also didn't say anything remotely racist. Saying that Mugabe took things from white people and gave them to black people is not racist, it's a matter of historical fact and not something he ever disputed doing. Saying that the previous land owners were generally better educated than the new recipients isn't racist either, and is a point you also made (while for some reason implying that I had missed it).

"This is bullshit - you're oversimplifying a complex situation to the point of no longer adding anything useful to the discussion."
Zimbabwe's hyperinflation, and every other example of hyperinflation, are symptoms of much wider problems and gigantic screw-ups. 
Mugabe thought that seizing property from white people and gifting it to black people would overhaul economic disparity and reinvigorate his country. Instead it killed off almost all foreign investment, made it incredibly expensive for the government to borrow, and put important productive assets in the hands of poorly educated people.
None of that really has anything to do with the central bank of Zimbabwe. They are just the ones who got stuck with the problem, *and* with a cognitively declining geriatric dictator telling them what to do.
Comparing Zimbabwe to developed economies with some realistic separation of the central bank from the government is pointless and does nothing to support your views.

I like the way you phrased the title like a news article rather than just your personal opinion. Now all we need is a Bitcoin journalist to come and write an article about this issue based entirely on a handful of reddit comments.
Coinbase probably tends to have more issues during volatile times because there are sudden spikes in use during volatility. New customers want to set up accounts, old customers drop in for the first time in two years and try to buy/sell on their dormant account. 
The idea that Coinbase - a company that is usually criticised here for embracing regulation too willingly - is selectively scamming it's users; that's ludicrous. They are well funded in the short-term, and in the long-term they have a lot more to gain by becoming a huge financial services company than by scamming a small proportion of the customers.

It's not specifically about the USD rate. It's about tying the lottery ticket to a relatively stable value.

Coinbase does lots and lots of off-chain transactions. They provide managed customer wallets and payment processing for companies, thus allowing them to shuffle numbers around in their internal database without actually making on chain transactions.

I mentioned "black market activity" because the discussion was about government's attempting to ban Bitcoin. In that context Bitcoin itself is the criminal activity. It's got nothing to do with other crime.


And now we come full circle. The community adapting around institutional banning of Bitcoin would mean decades of stifled growth. 
You can say that government intervention wouldn't *kill* Bitcoin, but it could certainly shoot it in both kneecaps leaving Bitcoin crawling forward inches at a time.

Democracies are supposed to work "one-memeber=one-vote". The corruption comes from lobbyists representing rich members trying to override the wider populace. 
Depending on what aspect of Bitcoin you're referring to, that lobbying isn't even necessary. 
Mining is being quickly dominated by a small number of big players, so a handful of individuals will decide what direction the protocol goes in. 
And the currency itself isn't neatly distributed across the world, it's largely concentrated in the hands of a fairly small number of early adopters. Those people have orders of magnitude more influence over the future of Bitcoin than you or I ever will.

In your example the person who makes a smart bitcoin investment gets extra bitcoins and they are worth more. But the person who makes a bad bitcoin investment loses their bitcoins.

The person who sits on their very large pile of deflationary currency doesn't increase their wealth by as much as they might if they actively invested.

1. Letting the 1MB cap "hit for a while" means making the bitcoin network look like an unscalable piece of crap to people on the outside.
2. Population, transaction frequency, use of the network are all most likely to continue growing for an indefinite period in the future. Technology is also most likely to continue growing (whether it keeps up with Moore's law or not). So making a single time jump is a terrible solution.

Without resorting to any Joker memes; it really IS about sending a message. Mtgox has allowed itself to be screwed with on an epic scale, and, as the single biggest hub for BTC exchange, has done serious damage to Bitcoin's fragile reputation in the process. 
If, in the wake of all this, Mtgox continues to be the biggest player, continues to be the default market for stats services, continues to be the first port of call for new users, then no lessons will be learned.
If however they see droves of customers moving to the other exchanges, leaving them with only the laziest least active traders, then they will step up their game. And those other exchanges will realise that they could be next if they don't get their shit together.

I think the key element is this: If you had discovered patterns in the market, reliable repeating patterns that let you buy and sell at the right time and consistently make money. Would you tell other people about it, or would you keep it to yourself ensuring that only you can capitalise on this phenomenon? 
The answer is clearly the latter, and yet people don't keep TA methods secret. In fact they broadcast them far and wide. They post to forums to make sure other people have seen the same flag that they've seen; because if no-one else saw it, it won't actually mean anything.

Those are the facts. Segwit was designed to - at least partially - fix transaction malleability. It happens to also increase the block size and therefore transaction capacity because it moves data out of the part of the block that is constrained by MAX_BLOCK_SIZE.

I don't think you can. But to some extent you can control how concentrated that pool of early adopters is, and how disproportionate their gains are. If a genuine Bitcoin 2.0 competitor were launched today the first million coins would be mined by tens of thousands of different people. Quark's creators wouldn't want that, so they cut the block reward halving from 4 years to 3 weeks ensuring that they would still be able to get enough quarks to control the market.

Not to be pedantic but aren't altcoins referred to as altcoins because they are derivations, deviations and copies of Bitcoin. As the progenitor Bitcoin can't ever be an altcoin.

@_date: 2013-12-24 14:13:58


Depending on your definition, the problem could be that an alternate crypto currency has a more desirable trait. Could the Bitcoin protocol be altered to incorporate that trait? Yes. Would it though?
People often state that as long as the mining network agrees any desirable new feature can be added. But how long have people spent arguing over stuff as simple as changing the maximum block size to allow for greater numbers of transactions? How many arguments have there been over how and if default transactions fees should be calculated?
I worry that if some challenger did come along with some hypothetical advantage it would take far too long for the core developers and the majority of the mining network to agree on.

The fiat hoarding is a reference to the *funding for lending* scheme that the UK treasury has been running for the last year.

1. So-and-so's law suggests that no company with a market cap bigger than Bitcoin's will adopt Bitcoin. This makes sense because the ecosystem simply isn't big enough to incorporate their level of trade yet.
2. Some of the big companies you mention have been looking into launching their own digital currencies. Probably in development for years, and they would stand to profit much more from the adoption of FaceBucks for example than they do by using Bitcoin.
3. It's taking a very long time for Bitcoin to shake its shady image. The fact that the price didn't collapse with the Silk Road shut-down is a big boost, but there is still a way to go.

This statement answers itself. Having the very short block-halving period means that a vast proportion of the coins end-up in the hands of certain types of people:
1. The creators and their close personal buddies. 
2. People actively seeking out the latest alt-coin so they can get rich quick.
That doesn't really make for a solid base on which to grow. Even if the guys who created Quark are in it for the long haul, those who happened upon it on day 2 are almost certainly hoping to pump and dump for a quick profit.

In the world of private bartering between Bitcoin miner A and Bitcoin user B, taxation is pretty much impossible unless those people voluntarily identify themselves. 
However, the more widely used Bitcoin becomes the more taxable it will be. 
* If I buy a computer from Bitcoinstore, they will pay corporation tax on their profits. Or they will be raided by the IRS.
* If my employer started paying my salary in Bitcoin the payroll department would deduct income taxes etc before the money ever got to me, just like they do now. 
* If I'm an early adopter buying a $1 million property despite having little official income, there is going to be an audit. 
I'm curious as to how people think they will avoid these forms of taxation? And what list of books they'll be taking to pass the time in prison?

Yeah, I tried as you suggested re-reading that paragraph multiple times, but it didn't help. I have no idea what he is getting at there. 
But more generally I thought it was interesting/telling how many posts have been made in response to his comments from people who see a valuation that is *only* 30% higher than current trade and think he's ridiculously bearish or some sort of government shill trying to put potential investors off. 
The reality is that Bitcoin's actual use for trade hasn't expanded anywhere near as much as the price has increased. While being too lazy to work it out, I'd guess even the massive boost in trade on black friday didn't bring Bitcoin's currency use anywhere near to its current price.

It's not an argument, it's a false equivalency.
Is it true that a sizeable proportion of bitcoins were mined by a small number of early adopters? Yes. But that happened over a period of years, and it happened because crypto currency was fairly a new concept that few were looking into.
The Quark design scheme takes this accidental element of Bitcoin that many would call a negative, and deliberately replicates and amplifies it. 
@_date: 2013-11-28 16:40:00
Maybe you didn't get the memo but bitcoins are divisible. You don't have to buy and sell full bitcoins at $1000+. 
Personally I like the proportional fee structure far more than flat rate fees the stock-brokers usually charge. It creates less of a barrier to entry for paupers like myself. 
I'm also wary of any service if I can't see how they make money. If BTC China are not charging any trade fees how exactly are they paying for their staff and their servers? I raised the exact same questions when inputs.io started up and, coincidentally, they "got hacked" and "lost" $1million of customer funds.

I second this sentiment. 
OP is correct that they can setup a website with a QR code promising to provides goods or services in return for bitcoins, but how many people will trust a company that gives no registration details? 
If the company is registered then it becomes subject to all sorts of regulations, and that would contradict the "without permission from anyone" bit.

Bitcoin is taking an understandably cyclical path. 
Big bubbles attract media attention, and that attention fuels bubbles, but it's a really unappealing time for most retailers etc to adopt Bitcoin.

I'm not sure how much can be drawn from the currency trading data. 
As an unfortunate Brit my purchasing path goes like this:
* GBP -&gt; EUR (so I can use SEPA transfer instead of wire)
* EUR -&gt; USD (because Bitstamp only has USD market)
* USD -&gt; BTC
So all my trades show up in the USD portion, but that's not through choice, just availability.

ASICs may protect the network from botnet attack but they also reduce the number of independent people mining.
First you have a hundred thousand CPU miners using their existing computers.
Then you have a few thousand miners who took the risk of buying pre-order ASICs.

Bitcoins are worth only what we say they are worth, and every bitcoin transaction you make contributes to the constant revaluation.

I'm pretty middle class.

I make more than the average person and am fairly responsible with money; so I could certainly fund my future kids education if needed.
But my parents were not middle class. Without the social system our country has, and the taxes used to pay for it, I would not have the job I do. Some kid from a rich family would be doing my job, and I'd be working in a factory or on one of the farms near my home village.

That's the key difference. At Bitstamp or wherever you aren't handing over cash, you're making a bank transfer. The KYC rules are designed to ensure that the bank account you're transfering money from actually belongs to you rather than some chump whose account you've gained access too. 
Imagine for a moment that someone gets access to your bank account (via keylogger, social engineering, shitty bank security whatever). If they initiate a bank transfer to their own bank account, it can be traced and reversed. If they initiate a transfer to mtgox, convert the whole lot to Bitcoin as soon as it clears and transfer the bitcoins to their own wallet address, nothing can be done.

Maybe it's just my distorted recollection, but a large part of what drove Second Life publicity and major growth was the fact you could exchange Linden dollars for real-world currencies. Therefore some people started actually making money from "playing" a game. 
Just like Bitcoin the people who were making huge sums were the ones who had been involved the longest. People who had bought land, built in-game businesses etc. And importantly, as Daniel said, when the SL-fever died down and users disappeared in droves it was only those hard-core people left behind.

I don't think the quoted statements do anything to stop people buying and selling things without being a millionaire. But they do require that someone who is setting up an exchange, and taking cash/bitcoin deposits from thousands of customers, needs to have some backing and insurance. 
I know full on libertarians will disagree with that sentiment. But perhaps the customers of Bitcoin-24/Bitfloor/Bitcoin-Central and several other former exchanges would have liked some protection.

If you're really going to post 16 more of these can I make a couple of suggestions:
1) Try explaining simply and concisely what your business does. i.e. you let people pay their shipping costs with Bitcoin, right? 
Seriously, is that right? Because after reading all your post and visiting the website I'm still not entirely sure!
2) Don't plead for attention or business. 
Yes, lots of small businesses have gotten a boost from being the first in their field to accept Bitcoin. 
No, no-one should expect the community to start throwing money at them just for that reason.
3) Your posts have devolved into philosophical ramblings and, while you referenced the hostile comment you received in your "Day 1" post, you haven't actually replied to anyone in any of the threads!
Try engaging with the community instead of just broadcasting to them.

As a left-statist nitwit (at least relative to some of the libertarian/anarchist nut jobs) I see nothing inherently wrong in concentration of wealth. Elon Musk, Richard Branson for example. Even Warren Buffett finally worked out what to *do* with all his money. 
The problem I have is with dynastic wealth. Buffett could have left his $50+ billion to his kids, or even just his first born, instantly elevating them to positions of insane power and influence.
The Matthew effect combined with untaxed inheritance would mean the theoretical Buffett dynasty lording it over humanity indefinitely. All they have to do is sit back and wealth, and therefore power, accumulate.

If we assume that the bitcoin price circa Dec 2012 (X) was proportional to the amount of business being done that month (Y), then the amount of business being done in June 2013 could give us an estimation of the current underlying value with all the speculative noise taken out.  
That doesn't mean that value would be a true bottom, but it shouldn't be massively far off.

If the question relates to everyday purchasing then the answer would be lower handling costs. 
Credit cards have built-in fees for merchants, and although cash would seem to be fee-free the time and effort and insurance to deal with it actually costs a fair bit.

Points for enthusiasm but I still think you're crazy. I also think there's a small element of moral hazard going on without you realising. 
Your plan if Bitcoin suddenly tanks and wipes out your entire life savings is to rebuild from scratch using your full time job and 30+ years of future employment. But how secure is your job? How secure is the company you work for? How secure is the sector in which your company operates?
If Bitcoin crashes *and* you lose your job, through external forces or personal problems or just plain bad luck, you will end up relying on others to financially support you. Maybe your ageing parents, maybe the state. i.e. you're gambling everything because you know someone else will pick up the pieces if you lose.

In the Bitcoin sense "the weekend dump" refers to a self fulfilling prophecy.
1.  Banks are closed over the weekend so cash deposits to exchanges can't be processed. So the buy pressure will drop while the sell pressure may continue, i.e. the price will drop.
2. Short-term traders try to sell their bitcoins before the dip (i.e. Friday) occurs so they can buy back in at a lower price. This day-trader sell-off causes the price to drop.
3. Day-traders adjust their expectations of when the dip will occur and start selling off earlier (i.e Thursday). 
Lather, rince, repeat as needed.

To make a transfer from someone else's unverified bank account all you need are their online banking details, which are by definition online &amp; in some cases not very secure. 
* People tick "save my id"/"remember my password" boxes on public computers. 
* Banks use mother's maiden name type "security" questions 
To verify an account you need both the online banking details AND the passport, utility bill etc.

You keep using that phrase and I don't think it's constructive. Waving placards or writing scathing critism of Wikipedia and everything they do could be considered 'spitting the dummy'. Witholding donations (and letting them know why you are doing so) until they reconsider their stance is pretty much financial democracy.
I don't think it's important for Wikipedia to take and hold Bitcoin donations as bitcoins. Bitpay would be a fine way for them to accept bitcoins without all the hassle. But the current setup funnels Bitcoin donations to Wikipedia while allowing Wikipedia to distance themselves from Bitcoin. 
What people want is for the Wikipedia donations banner to include a big QR code and a "we accept bitcoins" statement.

His point is pretty simple and explicit. You can buy weed on the internet with Bitcoin. You can't buy weed on the internet with most fiat currencies. At least not without easily traceable bank transfers or the massive risk of putting cash in an envelope. 
If you replace weed with "every good" then the benefit he is outlining is redundant. He's saying it isn't any easier to buy takeaway or a new laptop with bitcoins than it is with a credit card, and he's right.

ASICs increase the hash rate per unit of electricity used, but they don't reduce the overall power cost of the network.
The amount of power consumed by the network will only be constrained by the value of the coins generated each day. If mining currently generates ~$3.6million per day (plus transaction fees) then the miners will collectively spend up to $3.6million a day on electricity (less a little for capital costs).
