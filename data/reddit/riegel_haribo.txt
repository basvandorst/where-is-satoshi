Nice and slow all-native Python BIP38 paper wallet generator here, with strong integrated entropy generator:
(OSX comes with Python, BTW)
If a wallet can only be decrypted in a "bad" browser, it is non-compliant with BIP38. It is unclear from the OP what wallet generating software is being used, but they are all likely based on the "bounty" javascript code.

It took me 10 seconds to get irked at the first error: "Bitcoin gets to where its going.." That needs to be *it's*. The only time you use an apostrophe in "it's" is when it is a contraction of "it is", and you didn't.
Then the awkwardness of the other bullet points. "Bitcoin does it for pennies or even less" which is really the end of the previous bullet point sentence. Some of them flatly aren't correct; "Bitcoin is deflationary" is not correct for the past three months regarding value, and not correct for the next 126 years of mining regarding currency supply (already pointed out). There is no protocol promise that a small fee will be sufficient to confirm a transaction on a busy network. Other bullets repeat the same point, just rephrased.
And the first wallet is kryptokit(??), and no real wallet software?? Not quite "no more relying on third parties". I have seen similar promotional material, and it is usually thinly-veiled advertising - inserting a sketchy start-up operation alongside well-known names in the Bitcoin community.

BTW everybody knew a personal computer was not a bank of lights; personal computers had deep penetration by that time and everyone knew of personal computers; they were on many department store retail shelves, maybe even easier to pop down to the mall and buy one then than now. A C64 or an Apple II or even a Macintosh were well known. There were 7 million C64s sold by 1985.

In case you want to know the life of a bill, and why we don't have the text of it yet:
1. When a Representative has an idea for a new law, s/he becomes the sponsor of that bill and introduces it by giving it to the clerk of the House or by placing it in a box, called the hopper. The clerk assigns a legislative number to the bill, with H.R. for bills introduced in the House and S. for bills introduced in the Senate. The Government Printing Office (GPO) then prints the bill and distributes copies to each representative.
2. Next, the bill is assigned to a committee (the House has 22 standing committees, each with jurisdiction over bills in certain areas) by the Speaker of the House so that it can be studied.

The block reward is currently 25 BTC, about every 10 minutes. That means the miner or mining collective earns their money in Bitcoin, not in dollars. What they do with them, hold them, sell them, or distribute to members of the mining collective is up to them. This is how new Bitcoins are minted and enter the money supply. They aren't magically turned into dollars.
As to the value of Bitcoin, it depends on the market supply and demand. Certainly the built-in inflation of 3600 BTC a day may dilute the value if it is put on sale and $2M USD isn't entering the market every day. This may be what is happening recently, as there's not a whole lot of new news driving investors except for the MtGox collapse. The current amount mined daily is just a few drops in the bucket of 12.5 million BTC that already exist though; the holders of already-minted BTC have much more power in affecting price.

You don't run just any "data recovery" software (which mainly looks for deleted files with their data still where it used to be). After IMMEDIATELY discontinuing use of any drive with possibly-recoverable bitcoins on it, you need to boot another operating system off another drive, and use software that will scan the entire original drive by raw disk sector to discover any recoverable private key data that could be left on the drive.
Get a second hard drive or bootable USB with a linux distro on it, and get pywallet: 
Then use the command below, pointed to the appropriate device corresponding to the old hard drive and the correct drive size/area to scan, pywallet will go through these steps:
1. read every byte on the disk to look for keys
2. create a recovery file of private keys which enables
3. attempt recovery of password-encrypted keys using possible phrases
    python pywallet.py --recover --recov_device /dev/sdb --recov_size 120GB --recov_outputdir ~/foundkeys

Bitcoin, the currency, is created at an amount that halves every four years, currently 3600 BTC/day ($748,000/day equivalent earned by miners). Yet the value goes up; it is currently deflationary because it's buying power is increasing due to the limited supply and marketplace adoption that is increasing faster than it is being manufactured.
There is no central bank or government to control the economy and valuation by printing more money, the rate of money creation and the total amount that will ever exist was set programmatically at creation. This means the value is based solely on scarcity and demand. This is also *why* it is valuable, governments can't simply print more to pay their own bills and devalue private holdings into worthlessness.
Start thinking about Bitcoin, and you start questioning what money is, and who is in control of it.

An attack on bitcoin can be made by gaining a majority of the hashrate. This would allow the mining attacker to rewrite some history, erasing blocks that previously paid rewards to other miners, and erasing recent transactions others had trusted.

The secret part of a Bitcoin address is the Bitcoin private key:  The public key and Bitcoin address are derived from this. This is is a 256-bit number. You can roll a die or flip a coin to generate these bits. Your physical object must be unbiased in design, just as other methods of generating real randomness via quantum phenomena must be completely unbiased to resist the most determined cryptanalysis.
Anything that is created by the human brain or that can be known or affected by a third party is not an ideal random source for Bitcoin addresses.
