Oh I know that illegal primes are a *thing*, for example wikipedia presents a DeCSS source code snippet that can be represented as a prime. I was hoping you could give more context on what the illegal primes that went into bitcoin are, and what if any consequences it had on both the bitcoin network itself and the person that sent them into the bitcoin network.

I think the point is that for the majority of times the tx will go through without issues, and it's not worth it to worry about the few times a cup of coffee will be lost to double spends.

Just a cynical snark about how if it's being taught in school it's possible to be taken as from authority, and thus become true just solely on that.

You know what will make bitcoin the success we all want? Drugs. Yeah, The Silk Road. They'll stop trading for a while when there's great volatility, then hedge against the USD again. Those who cashed out can now fuel that money back into the market and slowly and steadily increase its price again, or even set up bigger and better production lines of their own. Dread Pirate Roberts probably cashed out (at least a bit) and can now, already being a tech nerd and bitcoin early adopter doing, you know, running SR itself, now has the funds to make SR a real force to reckon with.

Let us instead say that by removing this codependency we're forcing both of them (our current Bank and State) to evolve. Just as when Church and State were severed. What they'll evolve into remains to be seen.

Perhaps a subreddit focused on the more technical aspects about bitcoin (new development in mining hardware, talk about new suggested features to the protocol, etc) is warranted at some point in the future.

BTC is BTC, just like USD is USD. Cash is a word that means money you can hold in your hand. Cash is one form that both BTC and USD can take. BTC can also be digital, which is how most of us use it. USD can be digital too by putting it in a bank and using a credit card. You prove ownership of that money by having the credit card (and optionally a PIN), just like you prove ownership of your BTC by having your private key. 
Disregarding how the value of USD to BTC has been on quite a ride recently, functionally how is BTC not like cash?

You're being forced to hand over money at gun point. If you gave the other guy a PS2 or some digital bits matters not.

Yeah that's true, but you could make your own coin if you wanted to which is not the case with USD.

You can hold one USD in your hand and give it to someone else. You can also send one USD electronically to someone else (by using third parties such as banks or other companies). 
You can also do both of those things with BTC but you no longer need to use a third party.
What's the problem?

What was the exchange rate at that time?

It's from the viewpoint of the current banking system. From its perspective a free and open currency like Bitcoin is unrestrained and dangerous. The author says that it's the current banks that need to implement their own version of Bitcoin, post-haste, unless Bitcoin overtakes it by volition alone. 
@_date: 2013-04-17 08:01:40
Yes, I know. I'm just saying that it will keep BTC alive in the future too, regardless of how the BTC:USD value shifts.

If that doesn't sound like a self-fulfilling prophecy, I don't know what does.
