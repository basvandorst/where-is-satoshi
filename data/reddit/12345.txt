Er? No idea why you have posted that picture.

Thanks that is very helpful.
Would you still recommend paper wallets but not spending the balances? I currently have 5 paper wallets (luckily not all compromised). I could get myself a throw away printer and a new offline computer and make  a hundred new Bitcoin paper wallets... Or should I look at hardware wallets?
 I used to invest in your gambling site bank roll. I hope the site is still doing well, it is my second best investment to ever (after Bitcoin).  I couldn't invest in Clams as it is not linked to the Bitcoin price and I believe Bitcoin is rather undervalued so likely to boom soon. - I did try to purchase some token Clams to invest on your site but there was none to purchase at the linked site or possibly I asked for too many clams. I also couldn't work out how to get clams from my paper wallets.
I looked at other bank rolls but no one else had the trustworthiness and the customers to make the it worthwhile risking my Bitcoins.

Hi Dooglas
Im a long time fan. I know Blockchain wallet is not recommended but I do not have to use it in the future, as the Bitcoin is stored on a paperwallet. What I am wondering, is my private key still safe?
 By logging into my account I have no access to my paper wallet Bitcoin without scanning the qr code or re-entering my private key. When I try to send a Bitcoin it is labelled watch only, imported addresses.

Im not sure blockchain still offers this function to new users but the Bitcoin is still there and there is no way of me accessing it on Blockchain wallet or any other wallet without me scanning the private key.
So presumably what I did was scan the key onto the blockchain wallet and them have them not store the key, and thus keep the remaining Bitcoin on the paper wallet.

What, oh dear. I don't actually have a wallet as such I just have paper addresses . I cant remember where they were from but it was provably safe when I made them. It was fairly basic like bitaddress.org it may even have been that site, although I'm not sure that works offline or is probably safe.
Luckily the Bitcoins are still safe. Maybe I will create new ones or get a hardware wallet, I just dont trust the hardware wallets much, what if the company gets hacked and the hackers disable my device until I pay a ransom or they steal my coins?

I will research Electrum. I'm not sure if this is safer but it could be. 
If Electrum wallet ceases to exist do I loose my Bitcoin?
Are the Bitcoin stored online, or on my computer?
Thank you
