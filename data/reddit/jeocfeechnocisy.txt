@_date: 2015-06-18 13:35:29
The current problem not increasing the blocksize. The problem is scaling bitcoin. Clumsily increasing the blocksize isn't really a solution because even if the blocks were all full, it still couldn't handle the number of transactions we need in order to scale. I cited Garzik because he's also opposed to the 20MB hardfork. 
@_date: 2015-12-26 14:03:06
As a long time holder, I'm very grateful for the conservative approach to development. Changes should only be made after extraordinary scrutiny to ensure network longevity and maintain decentralization at all costs. The last thing developers should do is give in to the demands of some obnoxiously uninformed redditors. If anything, their approach further bolsters my confidence in Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-06-18 12:58:40
Is the Hearn team seriously just making shit up now? It's just insulting at this point.
@_date: 2015-12-27 18:44:23
Bitcoin.org is maintained by volunteers. Delisting CoinBase from their own site is not censorship. CoinBase is funded by hundreds of millions in venture capital and they think they can throw their weight around to bully volunteers into bending to their will. CoinBase has no problem with centralizing Bitcoin, but there are still a lot of us who do. 
@_date: 2015-06-18 14:11:03
I read them. Gavin acknowledges that it's a 'kick the can' solution and is even willing to compromise with the other core devs who are developing the Lightning Network to address the scaling problem. Mike thinks he can just discard these devs and make his own competing blockchain.

It's to be expected that some wallets will fall out of relevance over time, similar to how old internet browsers failed to adapt to new trends and fell to the wayside.

@_date: 2016-01-07 15:36:51

You misunderstand. I wanted to know if you were just parroting Mike Hearn or if you could actually articulate why you think this way. Turns out it's a bit of both. Mike's points have already been refuted dozens of times, and endlessly articulating/refuting them is just adding to the noise. Go back and read the original responses to Mike's article instead.
