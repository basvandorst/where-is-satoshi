just because you *can* buy a fraction of a bitcoin doesnt mean you have to! there are still going to be people who buy 10 bitcoins if it ever goes that high.
its not your job to tell people how many bitcoins they buy
@_date: 2017-12-26 11:44:09
Thank you!

Yes I began to have problems sleeping once it got past 10k and started shooting up real fast haha. When you start losing sleep its probably safe to assume your position has become too large and youre gambling with way too much money
@_date: 2017-12-26 11:58:41
750 obviously. i used a separate figure for my analogy to avoid confusing you but id clearly didnt work, maybe you are just easily confused :(
@_date: 2017-12-26 11:47:43
Yes thats what i've been saying, i dont want to gamble $17000 on bitcoin anymore lol, im going to be smart about it and take the money whilst i can
@_date: 2017-12-26 11:45:36
yes the price of bitcoin was $750 dollars each at the time. if i just said i bought at $750 then it doesnt sound like ive specified the actual price of the bitcoin so i added the "each" because to me that sounds more grammatically correct because its easier to understand what i am saying
@_date: 2017-12-26 11:43:06
no im not an investment god because ive never invested in anything before yet, but ive read a few books before i do
buying bitcoin isnt investing, its speculating aka gambling and yes i have been very lucky ! :D
i dont know why you would accuse me of being an investing god... :S ?
@_date: 2017-12-26 11:46:20
i dont think youre very smart :(

@_date: 2017-12-26 11:51:26
Oh but that doesnt really make much sense because bitcoin doesn't own blockchain technology and there are thousands of blockchains being used for other things totally unrelated to bitcoin, so i dont think thats a very good idea
@_date: 2017-12-26 11:13:35
Sorry but I think you've made a mistake, because I said im going to invest in stocks whilst im 20, and if the stock has a yeild of about 5% then I will have made the money back over 20 years if the dividends do not increase, but if they do in crease it may happen faster, but once the stock has paid me enough dividends to cover the cost of what I bought it for, I will be getting free money because I didnt put any more into it
@_date: 2017-12-26 12:50:17
im not rich dude, hes lying im just a normal person
@_date: 2017-12-26 11:33:44
I know all this but I wasnt looking for a discussion on what I'm going to invest in, im just saying that i am going to, now that i have made a lot of money from the new people buying bitcoin :)
@_date: 2017-12-26 12:33:50
well thats your opinion, but on this occasion im afraid i am going to have to disregard your opinion on the basis that you dont seem to know what youre talking about
@_date: 2017-12-26 12:02:29
thank you for contributing to my discussion :
@_date: 2017-12-26 11:30:50
well you dont "invest" in bitcoin because it doesnt produce any value, you just speculate on it :)
@_date: 2017-12-26 11:21:01
thats ok i guess but those poor people who will buy 1 bitcoin for $34,000 ! :(
obviously only half the people who buy bitcoin will win in the end because it doesnt produce any value of its own. i hope most people are ok though
@_date: 2017-12-26 12:42:37
why are you lying man its just sad
@_date: 2017-12-26 12:40:43
what are you talking about man? you dont even know who i am and i havent made millions ive made about $16000
and as i said i am trying to fix my life, by using my crypto gains to invest in things which will make my life more prosperous in the future. why you gotta hate on me, we're all just playing the game of life trying to become successful man. 
i mean if you think im lying thats up to you it doesnt really affect me, but i dont know why you would be so cynical about it.. if youve lost money and are angry then im sorry but its not my fault
@_date: 2017-12-26 12:50:06
i dont have 1000 i had 1 btc but i sold it
i guess i had 1000mBTC if thats where the confusion is coming from? i never made that post though and i dont know why youre telling people i am rich
im not rich folks!
@_date: 2017-12-26 11:18:58
Thank you! but yeah i dont think i want to gamble on bitcoin anymore, its a bit dangerous now :p
@_date: 2017-12-26 11:08:05
Why am i being downvoted? D:
@_date: 2017-12-26 12:57:26
yes but it says [removed] on the screen shot but you keep saying it was removed AFTER you took the screenshot. so you are lying!
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:02:57
entire post was terrible but one specific part was especially terrible


[citation needed]
and even if you do give a citation, its still gonna be wrong.
look at this road right here
as you can see, its massive.  they built it like that so it would be future proof, as they anticipate it will be necessary in the future.
did it create 18x more traffic? no. its completely empty, top gear did an episode on it and there were people playing football on it.


yeah i can imagine a lot of people decide to beat the traffic simply by not participating, and either not travelling, waiting until later, or getting the train. in other words people choose NOT to send bitcoin (whats even the point anymore) or perhaps use a different crypto currency.
basically what im trying to say is: you chat shit 
@_date: 2017-12-26 11:41:35
100% this.
I mean I could put my entire life savings on a horse in the grand national, and retire if i win. But if i only put £10 on the horse, and it comes first, im not exactly gonna try and kill myself just because I could have bet a lot more. Because it would have been crazy to do that, cause the horse might have lost and i'd be broke!
best to gamble/speculate responsibly and intelligently, and $17000 is a lot of money to gamble with lol

well if you think trading alt coins is investing then yes im afraid you are stupid because thats not what investing is :(
maybe you should read some books
@_date: 2017-12-26 11:53:32
no because bitcoin is priced per 1btc just like gold is priced per ounce
so you could say "i bought gold at $500/oz" is just the same as saying "i bought bitcoin at $500/btc" or "$500btc each"

the guy posting the fake picture of me claiming i have 1000 has made a mistake, because it says "deleted" in dutch on the picture as if he found a deleted post of mine, but if it was deleted he wouldnt be able to see it ;)
only someone with a link to the deleted post would be able to see it, and it wouldnt be on my reddit submissions
dont get tricked guys!
@_date: 2018-09-22 20:51:38
Thanks for the good reply, you're very helpful.
Is the 1000 bits minimum for all nodes forever? Does it depend on the node? If not, what happens If I connect to a node that accepts 10 bits minimum, which is connected to another node with 1000 bits minimum? Will I be able to transact with the 1000 bits minimum node? (probably a retarded question, but i am a retarded person when talking about this subject)
I have been considering buying Andreas' book so maybe I will.
How long do you think it will be before Lightning network is actually usable for ordinary people to understand and buy coffee with? Crucially will it be before the blocks become full again and fees start rocketing, like they did last year?

bitcoin isnt about community. its about individualism. the nerds on this reddit do not represent a majority of users. not a chance.

@_date: 2017-12-26 12:00:54
It doesnt matter if bitcoin is the playground the devs use to develop the technology, because bitcoin isnt going to reap any of the rewards if it is implemented into something useful one day, since bitcoin isnt a centralised company with a patent on blockchain technology
@_date: 2017-12-26 11:11:26
Good for them, I hope it works out, but why are you being mean to me? I've made some profit and now I want to use it to start investing so my future will be more prosperous 
I think everyone should do that after the bitcoin speculation is over, but if some people chose to spend the money on cars or other things then thats cool, but im not gonna call them out for it
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:26:11
i got out 2 weeks ago, feeling comfy as fuck
so glad this is happening, cause ive had nothing but abuse from bitcoiners ever since i sold and told them "its gonna crash"
@_date: 2017-12-26 12:48:43
im not insecure but i think you are because youre going through a lot of effort to try and make me look stupid and its kinda sad because its not even true
if i was a millionaire i would tell you but im not

I think you're a pedo, but just because I think that doesn't mean its true. Blocked.
@_date: 2017-12-26 13:21:55
No, investing is buying something which you believe will produce more value than what you paid for it over time.
Speculating is where you buy something and hope that in the future someone will buy it from you for more than you paid for it. but it hasnt produce any value for you in the mean time!
If you buy a load of cows for $1000 and they produce $500 worth of milk every year then you have a return on investment of 2 years. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 12:10:34
you cant by stocks in "internet"
you can buy some fibre optic cables which it runs on but thats not buying shares in the internet
and you cant buy shares in blockchain either. you can buy bitcoin which uses a blockchain to work. you can buy shares in timmyswebsite.com but thats not going to give you any stake over youtube.com
@_date: 2017-12-26 13:52:07
Yes that is still speculation
i made $16000 on bitcoin, that was also speculating
please use your brain

Bitcoin is very poorly distributed. Few people have too much control over the price
@_date: 2018-09-23 10:30:38
I'm sure it could have a good use case but I dont buy into this idea that it can just replace the blockchain.
Is the idea to move *some* small transactions off chain to keep the blockchain less bloated (with the advantage of instant, 1 sat transactions) or is it to completely replace the blockchain? 1MB will never be enough at a global scale even for everyone to OPEN A PAYMENT CHANNEL so a contentious fork is inevitable
@_date: 2018-09-23 00:01:15
get off my thread you sad little man
@_date: 2018-09-07 11:06:59
only a minority of alarms go off. people are complacent. human nature. miners will continue to do as their told because they think other miners are doing the same thing.
@_date: 2018-09-07 11:32:50
this will change when Intel and AMD start mass producing consumer grade ASIC miners.

you cant take a screenshot if i deleted cause how would you even have the link to it? once its deleted its not in my submissions so you have been caught lying ;)
@_date: 2018-09-23 10:27:43
I cant convert BTC to LTC for a one time transaction without using an exchange and trusting a third party. It also makes absolutely no sense to me to have multiple small chains rather than just one big one.
I think BCH is very good actually, but in my view has become too controversial and wont overtake BTC. Its only big problem is it has the same POW algorithm as BTC and much lower hash rate which raises security concerns but I see no reason why BTC shouldnt just raise its blocksize and do away with BCH for good. Surely we cant just keep 1mb forever when 5 billion people are sending transactions? Even with LN unless we make an almost complete departure from the actual blockchain all together, which kinda sounds like "bitcoin has failed". "The underlying technology we've been celebrating for the past 10 years, we no longer care about"
