I feel like i'm missing something obvious here so this might be a stupid question. 
It looks like the receiving address refreshes every time it receives a payment. How do find your real/original address if needed or create a static address? 
I'd like to setup bitpay to consistently transfer to my copay wallet, but wouldn't that be an issue if the keys are constantly changing and being recycled?

Shared accounts where you need multiple signatures/authorities. 
Say a business with 3 directors, usually need 2 signatures for purchases. Same deal here

I guarantee there will be no turning Paypal back on after this. I simply do not have the desire nor the resources to further fight this decision any further then what has been done. 
Again thanks for all the support guys :D

Maybe the model is the real Satoshi Nakamoto ;)

I hope other providers would say no... the majority of providers have probably aimply yet to feel the wrath of the mighty paypal and not have this demanded of them.

We actually had a rather decent experience with paypal until all this happened. We too had a dedicated account rep who would call us monthly to check in and make sure everything was going good and offer tips to make paypal an easier choice for payment. 
To claim they are much larger is kind of asinine not knowing how large our customer base is. I have never made claims of being larger then any other company as I simply don't know how large my competitors are. 
There are no shenanigans here qith the exception of what paypal has done. I would not be suprised if whatbox suffered the same fate as us one day but I hope they make it through unnoticed as I have nothing but respect for them.

Correct, we already use bitpay :)

Another vote for quadriga. They have been easy to use and consistent. Low fees too and free to fund and withdraw

If your rent is over $1000, the landlord would also need to verify their account with bitpay to transact it. 
You can also opt for the "Starter" account which is 1% of the value, not the $30 per month. This would make sense for collecting under 3k of rent.

Where exactly are you getting this information? I've used bitpay for a long time, and only ever charged 1% as a Canadian vendor.
Actually they do not take a % if you subscribe to a monthly plan, which starts at $30.

This depends on implementation. Honestly it only takes about an hour to get running and if it drives even $100 of new business a month why not do it? Especially when you have services that will automatically convert to FIAT.

You are correct. Not being able to accept paypal is a huge blow to any business, but the support from our current clients and reddit has been huge! Its nice to see so many of our customers switching to bitcoin!

Question: what kind of business makes piracy look good?
@_date: 2014-08-23 19:36:04
Agreed however most sellers charge a premium over exchanges

You more then likely report it in the current exchange of whatever your base currency is... That is if you choose to report it. The business will most likely want to report it though.
