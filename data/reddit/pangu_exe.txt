I think it means, keep your coin in your address ( and don't move them).
@_date: 2015-08-16 13:54:00
I meant it is better to don't move your coin during the fork (I am talking in general).
@_date: 2015-08-01 13:18:18
Can you take a picture or video of the 'venture'? Thanks.

You too.
@_date: 2015-08-01 18:41:29
Oh yes, you are right... now I've noticed the 'cake' so I assume it is my 'cake day'. sorry if I seem arrogant, I did not want to be arrogant.
@_date: 2015-08-01 13:21:53


this 'venture'.
@_date: 2015-08-16 19:11:18
Also for me.
@_date: 2015-08-16 15:11:41
Exactly, it seems he doesn't have his own opinion about all the situation... and he is using 'fake' satoshi quote to appear credible.
RIP Adam Back's reputation.

Yes but It is your choice, I have only explained you the "bagholding"meaning.
@_date: 2015-08-16 13:43:45
It is better to 'hold' bitcoin, during the fork (if it will happen).
@_date: 2015-08-01 13:33:58
I think you can't understand my question, I have asked if you can take some picture of this venture "[...] We plan to eat pizza in front of Mark while he's in Prison [...]" for testimony the event.
@_date: 2015-08-16 19:17:21
I think a low bitcoin price is good for the mass adoption but (obviously) not for miners and speculators, however btc is dropping because it is a free market (Simple opinion).
Bitcoin is really really volatile.

Thank you for this thread.
@_date: 2015-08-16 13:55:32
No, read the nikize comment.
@_date: 2015-08-01 18:41:56
Sorry again and yes , today it's my 'cake day'.
@_date: 2015-08-16 13:50:49
Also the nodes make a big difference, because their work is to spread/broadcast the various transactions.
@_date: 2015-08-16 20:00:04
Good luck!
@_date: 2015-08-16 22:58:33
What the hell is "super majority :P ? However the free market will choose the 'right' thing... just wait a couple of months.
@_date: 2015-08-01 13:54:55

Great news, thanks greenAddress  and also Ledger !
@_date: 2015-02-16 13:51:38
Yes, maybe it is better to keep the limit of 1MB per block.
@_date: 2015-02-17 22:30:44
Interesting video, I've added it on my thread : 
@_date: 2015-02-18 11:18:20

Thanks for you opinion, no problem. It is only a joking post, nothing of serious.
@_date: 2015-02-03 17:42:06
Amazing :D.... BTC is dead  lol.  
@_date: 2015-02-10 10:10:50
It necessary to rise the block size limit from 1MB to 20 MB, it is not a drama.
