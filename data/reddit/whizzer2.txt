It would be a wise choice to meet her and confess that it was your mistake.

EOS has a very bright future. With mainnet release only 2 weeks away, it's sure to go up in value. One of the best long term investments, even banks know.

BTC and EOS are two completely different things, though I'm sure you'd know that if you gave it the time of the day to do the research on different products. That's like if you went to the store and said "These apples are shit because this hamburger is better." They're two completely different products that accomplish two completely different things. Close-minded people such as yourself see BTC and think that all other cryptos don't matter when you're too lazy and stuck up to even do the research as to what the actual platform accomplishes. I hope BTC does well for you, because EOS has certainly done quite well for me.

What about coins like EOS that are looking to revolutionize the way cryptocurrency is done?
