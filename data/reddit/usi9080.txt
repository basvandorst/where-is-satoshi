Mine XMR

If everyone holding Bitcoin just wants to hold it forever and get rich, Bitcoin will die. It needs to be useable as a currency. BCH isn't going to work, but BTC needs to evolve to lower the fees or it is going to have major problems down the road.

Yes another tipbot!
I like Bitcoin because it's decentralized and no one group can control it in practice (if mining pools don't get out of control of course)

Nah it was a minimum pool payout that's been fixed for years, I'm pretty sure it was the same back when I actually mined it. I'm holding the BTC somewhere where I actually own the private keys now.

Is there anywhere I can read about segwit and how using these addresses will affect me?
@_date: 2017-12-18 06:22:38
I know it's essentially impossible, but I'm laughing at even the possibility that this guy could get a block by hand-mining. I love this, thanks for posting!

It is profitable vs electricity to mine Monero, Bytecoin or the like using phones, but only if you already have the phone or don't have to pay for it. I wouldn't use my main phone on it either to avoid heat damage.

Credit card fee I think. You can avoid it by going through GDAX and doing a bank transfer, but coinbase sucks with transfers (they will withdraw the money immediately and then sit on it for a week before you can buy BTC)

On a usb miner that draws 2W? Not really, considering I didn't have to touch it once after the initial setup.

Yes, try AAminer. It's not bitcoin but you can just convert the altcoins to bitcoin like I do. I have a bunch of old prepaid android phones that I wasn't using that I currently have mining Bytecoin because of the low payout threshhold. Once I get a way to autostart the app it will actually be worth it.
XMR/FNC dual mining is technically the most profitable, but you will never reach the cashout threshhold on any pool. With BCN you actually can.

I have only used Android so I don't know if the apps are there. Minergate is a very easy one to setup if you want but they do have worse hashrates and I found their app less than stable. 
On Android I use AAminer and Neoneominer to some success on my old phones. Sign up for a pool and put in your info. If phones are your only miners, do bytecoin, so that you can at least get a payout (Monero is better profit but will take forever to get minimum payout)

99% of the time cloud mining is either a scam or simply not worth it for you, the buyer.
Ask yourself: If I had a machine that could literally print money, why would I rent it out to someone else? You either wouldn't, or you would because they are giving you more money than you would make.

For Coinbase, you can transfer to GDAX for free cashout. (Both owned by same company)

It's not really technical, but the 3blue1brown video on Youtube about Bitcoin/Blockchains is quite decent.

What wallet were you using?
@_date: 2017-11-26 04:34:30
When I was 13 I found Bitcoin for around $8/BTC or and was going to buy $30 worth. Decided against it at the last minute because I didn't have an easy way to pay online (ironic) at 13.
Don't be like me.
@_date: 2017-11-26 06:40:26
It's only $9 for 1 mBTC. If you believe in the technology and concept then yeah, you should buy some. Just don't buy more than you can afford to lose as always.

I'm not sure you need that specific wallet to recover your balance but the 12 secret word should be everything you need. Since you mined an entire bitcoin this was probably when there weren't many wallets, so maybe bitcoin core? Do some research on how to input the code, but you can definitely recover this unless you had it in an online wallet.

Mycellium is great, I have no issues with it. That being said I wouldn't feel comfortable keeping a large amount on my phone.

1 doge = 1.1 doge

If you have the private key, you can import it into any bitcoin wallet and transfer the contents. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 22:55:56
So it's really easy. Just spend BTC and then replace what you spent right afterwards.
