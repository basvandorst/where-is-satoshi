What do your expect? I have no experience here
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:18:58
Right but what about the people who bought btc at 50¢ and sold it once it hit $100? Bet they with they had held on right? Does the same not apply here?
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:10:42
Dude same. I sold at 18 hoping for a drop but now I’m afraid by the time I get my money it’ll be back up to 20k. Wtf
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:27:11
Its freaking out
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:50:34
No fucking joke
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:55:31
Learn to understand like you’re 6!
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:22:55
What do you mean crash?
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:52:03
Can you explain this a little more? I’m interested.
My worry is should I sell now, wait for a crash and start over or just hold my current btc and wait for 5 years and see what comes of it. I’m leaning towards the latter because the idea of buying and selling stresses me out.

bird in the hand is worth two in the bush
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:27:04
I have no idea what to think
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:29:58
Do you think that will actually happen? I expect it to drop to like 14k but then keep rising again.
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:59:39
It’s already corrected
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:48:11
Likewise! But ai wonder if I hold for 5 years of my money won’t grow 50 fold instead of double you know?
@_date: 2017-12-08 08:07:26

How come? Asking for friend
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:57:19
I think about this at least twice a day.. at least
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:53:47
I have this thing where if I hear something enough, I usually accept it as truth. Sometimes I’m wrong, sometimes I gotta analyze the stuff, but generally it saves me some trouble.
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:36:53
I say 15000 by the middle of this month, but today and tomorrow will suck
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:37:07
It’ll explode again. I hope.
