What most people don't understand is how ridiculously rare A full bitcoins are given that there will only ever be 21 million bitcoins. The earth population is over 7 billion, So for most people it will not be about owning one or more bitcoin, it will be about having bits or Satoshis.
There are exactly I00,000,000 million Satoshi units in each Bitcoin, and the value of each Satoshi will achieve parity and surpass the value of the world reserve fiat currency the $dollar.
When bitcoin enter into its third phase, the bitcoin community will stop exchanging bitcoin for fiat dollars, we will value the planet earth at the total number of bitcoins, and make the cheapest single purchasable unit of the cheapest element the smallest possible unit of bitcoin. Everything scales from there. The world will start pricing goods and services in bits or Satoshis.

The earth population is over 7 billion, So for most people it will not be about owning one or more bitcoin, it will be about having bits or Satoshis.
When bitcoin enter into its third phase,  (1) bitcoin will support A family for generations, like one million dollars did back in the 19th century . Here's a good example of how it would work. By having a wallet like Jaxx or Exodus.  All you would do is create A saving account in your wallet with (1) full bitcoin. When that one bitcoin increase in value your wallet will have the option to convert the increase profit into any number of altcoins, this way you and your family will  be living off that one bitcoin, and will never touch your one full bitcoin because it will be too valuable.  .

I think you’ve got a game going on, and the Fed is accommodating all sorts of securities fraud.  Then, the money is being pulled out in a variety of ways.”
