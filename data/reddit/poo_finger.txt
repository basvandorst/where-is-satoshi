If I wasn't getting free electricity, I'd be screwed.

It's barely broken in. At this rate op could drive it until death and it probably still wouldn't need the timing belt/chain swapped out.

I agree that was a legitimate question. The last two S3s I picked up off of eBay I offered BTC. I got them slightly cheaper and he didn't get analy raped by pp. Win-win in my book.

It's been up and down repeatedly the past 24 hours for me.

It would have to be mesh or repeater based. Too many variables involved with HF signal propagation.

How are you going to get around the encryption rule?

These forms of data transmission are very much a reality now, but for our purposes I think the difficulties really swing the notion to the improbable for a few reasons. Security of the blockchain being my biggest concern. Current regs prohibit any form of encryption on the amateur frequencies so every broadcast is wide open. Without the ability to test and tune you'd be behind the curve from go. We would also run the risk of malicious interference. Someone with a high power station could pump out whatever on the designated frequencies essentially drowning out the network. The FCC protects me from interference as it stands now, but global blackout = no more FCC. 
While it's fun to theorize about a scenario like this, the reality is you'd probably be hard pressed to get too many radio operators on board. We'd be pretty busy trying to keep lines of communication open for health and safety purposes. That is if things didn't completely fall apart and devolve to regional warlords and whatnot.  The other reality is that in a world that's no longer digital (assuming this is a permanent situation), the appeal of digital currency would fade quickly in lieu of tangibles like gold, silver and other barter-able goods. If I'm selling you food or medicine I want a tangible object or service performed of equivalent value.

Looks like someone else has been binge watching Revolution on netflix.
Actually propagation wouldn't necessarily be an issue, but confirmation times could be negatively impacted. Packet radio and other digital radio modes allow the transmission of data long distances over radio waves. Higher frequency will give you faster baud rates but at the expense of distance since VHF/UHF and up are line of sight. HF on the other hand is capable of worldwide communications, and depending on the mode, with very little transmit power. Personally I'd look to the 20 meter (14MHz) band since that band is typically open day and night. Where it gets problematic though is the antenna required to transmit on that frequency is going to be big. Like a little over 33' long big. It makes me think mesh netting in the microwave frequencies with centralized HF station acting as the actual blockchain node/clearinghouse to communicate globally with other nodes. 
With there being no power I think signal integrity for global propagation would be pretty reliable. Power line noise, fluorescent lighting, electric motors and pretty much any other manmade form of EM interference would be gone. Guys like me wouldn't know what to do with a noise floor like that. 
Another thought about addressing the bandwidth limitation of the HF digital modes; link aggregation. You'd definitely want to make sure you had good checksums and probably parity bits JIC, but I believe it's doable.
