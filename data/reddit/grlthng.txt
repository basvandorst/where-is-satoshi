Transactions in any orphaned blocks are assumed to have never happened. Its a problem because if you accept a transaction confirmation in a block that ends up getting orphaned, it means that you accepted a transaction which never happened. 
I'm not sure how you arrived at those numbers, but it is worth nothing that a transaction can be in a orphan block and a non-orphan block ( a valid block).

I'm assuming it has something to do with historical data that blockchain.info keeps. Also, they have a system that's been in place for much longer, so is more stable. 
What it sounds like here is that mt gox has no idea how long this problem has been going on, and how many withdrawls they have processed has been fradulent. They also had nothing in place to detect it, so they have to do extensive hacks to fix the problem.

There was exactly "A bug in the bitcoin software" , that is indisputable. 
No malleability is not a new thing that was discovered. But its an old problem that was never fixed in the reference wallet. The main devs cannot claim "Oh we knew about that problem... but we never did anything about it". That is perhaps much worse than "Oh we didn't know about that problem".  
Should it have been solved privately? I don't know. Personally, if he hadn't shouted the alarm, I don't think it would have gotten the devs attention.

I might be wrong, so feel free to jump in and correct me. 
It is generally recommended that you wait for 6 confirmations before accepting that the transaction has been succesful. But the number 6 is rather arbitrary, and it is clearly not 100% safe as we'ven just seen GHash.io mine 6 in a row. So confirmation time actually should be a function of the hashing percentage that the biggest player in the bitcoin network owns. 
So in theory, as long as people are adjusting the number of confirmation they expect, there should not be any problems in terms of X confirmation double spending attacks. Now, there is a big problem of the transaction taking longer , but that is a seperate issue not related to the overall security of the network.   
I think the 51% attack is a very real possibility, but this event is only indirectly related and is a solvable problem. 
@_date: 2014-01-26 23:03:30

Here are some things I can think of on top of my head
price manipulation - current total value of bitcoins is 600 million $ or something like that. It could easily be target by a moderate size hedge fund for good old price manipulation schemes (and it would probably be 100% legal) like pump and dump. 
government regulation and intervention - they could put in place various regulations and laws that would prohibit bitcoins 
exploitation of known technological vulnerabilities - a big heist of bitcoins from a single source due to plain old hacking, perhaps a sophisticated DoS attack that would inconvenience a large amount of users. 
overlooked or unknown technological vulnerabilities - the US government actually employs the world's best cryptographers and mathematicians. There have been cases where their knowledge was more than several years ahead of anything being done in academia. It is very possible that they have the capabilities to exploit unknown vulnerabilities in the bitcoin system. 
competing digital currencies - basically there is nothing preventing anyone from starting their own bitcoin like currency. I can use the exact same system , same software, and just start the transaction history completely anew and call it buttcoins.

Not really, he managed to scam people in a trust based network. That does not prove that a trust based network doesn't work. It merely says that the participants of the network was too naive and they were taken advantage of. Once the pariticipants understand the scam and how to avoid it, its not really an issue. 
What he did is not all that different from scamming people on ebay.

You can count that any measures taken against the bitcoin network will be met with equal counter measures to prevent it. They might be able to sink the exchange rate but it will be temporarily.

well malmi certainly had a huge impact getting bitcoin off the ground, you could even say he is the co-founder of bitcoins next to satoshi even if they are not the same person.

Facebook and Google (owns youtube) are corporations. It is easy to shut down a corporation from the government perspective.
Bitcoins is not a corporation, and it is not centralized. Much harder to shut it down.

It's interesting to read, because I'm sure many people thought the same thing in 1995. In hindsight, every problem that he brought up was completely fixable either through technological advances, and smart implementation of business ideas.

If you are day trading as an "average" person , yes you are fucked. If you trade on a much longer horizon (months, years), than it should not matter that HFT's are taking a tenth of a percent of your profit in exchange for liquidity.

You can't even answer this question yourself and you bought 55,000$ worth of bitcoins? 
@_date: 2013-11-29 05:52:38
Yea, that's a big difference, can somebody else confirm this?

If you know is name, adress, etc... and you have evidence that he stole BTC, band together with other victims and either go to the police or file a civil suit...

I think the more important part is that 54% of Americans don't know what a Bitcoin is. We are still very early in the game.

Not really suprising. Buffett and Munger has always been technophobes, and that has not really held them back obviously. From their investment perspective, bitcoin is rat poision and I don't really disagree with that. They have much more profitable options to pursue and I think that is all that Munger is saying.

While the Bitcoin ATM itself may not rely on banks (if its cash only) , the companies that operate the bitcoin ATM will need to rely on a bank to pay its employees, etc..

Some clarification: 
"Crowdfunding" in this case referrs to the selling of ownership of a company to the common public in order to raise money. It does not refer to the selling of products and intangibles in order to raise money, which is what Kickstarter does currently, and it is not AT ALL covered by this regulation. I repeat: what Kickstarter does currently is completely unrelated to this regulation.
Before this regulation, "crowdfunding" is entirey illegal so ordinary "unaccredited" investors could not help comanies raise venture capital by banding together. We actually have less regulation than before with this proposal because "crowdfunding" is now legal.

let's face it.. SR was wanted because it was moving massive amounts of drugs and other illegal products over the web. It has nothing to do with the fact that it used bitcoin. SR would have been fucked whether or not they used bitcoins as the transaction mechanism or not.
