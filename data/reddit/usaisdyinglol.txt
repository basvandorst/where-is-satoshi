@_date: 2018-08-21 02:52:35
That's some cool nonsense you got there. I guess people next to a farm don't need anything other than food then? Ooh, or maybe people in poor countries just live close to literally every kind of thing they could need. All of them. In the rural farmlands and in the slums. Makes perfect sense.
Look, I'm never going to convince you out of your delusion. Youre drowning in the Kool aid, I get it. But you're never going to get me to deny basic reality. If you want to keep working your whole life for someone else's benefit, and that makes you happy somehow, then go for it. But there's no changing the facts, you're a cuck.

Smith saying reveryone bitches about the poor, but the rich are the real enemy:
*We rarely hear, it has been said, of the combinations of masters, though frequently of those of the workman. But whoever imagines, upon this account, that masters rarely combine, is as ignorant of the world as of the subject.*
Chapter VIII, p. 80.
Smith advocating for a living wage:
*A man must always live by his work, and his wages must at least be sufficient to maintain him. They must even upon most occasions be somewhat more, otherwise it would be impossible for him to bring up a family, and the race of such workmen could not last beyond the first generation.*
Chapter VIII, p. 81.
Smith arguing national greatness is dependent upon the happiness of the poor, not the rich:
*No society can surely be flourishing and happy, of which the greater part of the members are poor and miserable. It is but equity, besides, that they who feed, cloath and lodge the whole body of the people, should have such a share of the produce of their own labour as to be themselves tolerably well fed, clothed, and lodged.*
hapter VIII, p. 94.
Smith saying big companies will lie to screw the poor but you shouldn't trust them:
*Our merchants and master-manufacturers complain much of the bad effects of high wages in raising the price, and thereby lessening the sale of their goods both at home and abroad. They say nothing concerning the bad effects of high profits. They are silent with regard to the pernicious effects of their own gains. They complain only of those of other people.*
Chapter IX, p. 117.
My favorite, Smith basically saying it is inevitable that companies and rich people will steal from you if you let them:
*People of the same trade seldom meet together, even for merriment and diversion, but the conversation ends in a conspiracy against the public, or in some contrivance to raise prices.*
Chapter X, Part II, p. 152.
Smith is saying that producers, companies, rich people, etc. they are all going to undermine the free market if they can and capitalism requires strong regulation to prevent this. Morever, the goal of free market capitalism is the enrichment of the laborer and the happiness of the poor. It's the exact opposite of "the overt, logical, conclusion" of putting "profits over absolutely everything".
One last Smith quote:
Whenever the legislature attempts to regulate the differences between masters and their workmen, its counsellors are always the masters. **When the regulation, therefore, is in favor of the workmen, it is always just and equitable; but it is sometimes otherwise when in favor of the masters.**
Chapter x, Part II, p. 168.

Well the only reason I asked is because there was a common sentiment in this sub once btc started dropping from 20k that it "had to lose 90%" becuase that was the pattern it had followed in every previous bubble. And I mean people were saying this at 15k. That 90% drop put it at 3k, which I was waiting for the pull the trigger on a few more. Sadly I wasnt the only one with that idea and it got to around 3500 before climbing again.

@_date: 2018-02-07 15:52:59


Right, so capitalism doesnt take human nature into account. Thats literally the main argument people have against socialism/communism. It only works on paper.


How could anyone know that? You cant compare our current system to a theoretical system that hasnt been invented yet and then say that the current one is better. The proof is in the pudding, wealth and power are concentrated in an increasingly small number of hands, and that is the intentional goal of capitalism. 


Believe whatever you want


I never advocated a central bank, but you keep harping on it. Again, concentrated wealth/power and corruption are the inevitable results of a system based on pure greed and self-interest. Like all capitalists, you're being intentionally obtuse to avoid that fact.


I agree with all of that, except for 


Because once again, thats what always happens under capitalism. The rich use their wealth and influence to take more for themselves and less for everyone else.


Lots of things are free, common land used to be free to live on. But when you assume that property rights are more valuable than human life, and you allow people to claim more land, money, or resources than they could ever use in several lifetimes, as our current system does, you cant be surprised when everyone else is fighting over the scraps.
@_date: 2018-02-07 01:38:49
Who are you quoting? Yourself? Lol
@_date: 2018-02-07 15:21:20
I never said i had a better solution. Im just an average person. All i said was that its pretty obvious that capitalism doesnt work. And its only going to get worse as automation increases and the rich keep getting richer and the poor even poorer. 
Ill use this analogy again, just because I havent invented open heart surgery doesnt mean i cant point out that bloodletting doesnt work. 
@_date: 2018-02-08 00:45:09
Except i never claimed that i personally have a better alternative. You on the other hand keep claiming capitalism can work, just without any humans participating in it i guess? 
@_date: 2018-02-07 02:08:03
You're defending capitalism with the "crony capitalism" line. Are you saying you dont support capitalism? Why beat around the bush?

@_date: 2018-02-07 02:49:36

@_date: 2018-02-07 16:08:35
Ill be honest its really tiring trying to get you to see the flaws in your own ideology. Its like talking to a wall, and just about as productive. 
Ill end it with this, you think that capitalism is great because anyone can start their own business and be successful. 
The majority of people arent doing this, theyre working their lives away making someone else richer. Now this is either because:
A- theyre lazy/unmotivated/not smart enough/ not savvy or self-responsible enough. That would mean that people in general are not good enough at navigating markets, which means that most of the world has to be unsuccessful in order for the few to be successful. In other words, thats their nature, as humans, and capitalism doesnt offer any solution to this. 
Or B - people are stuck in a subsistence lifestyle and are already working long hours for subsistence-level wages and cant reasonably be expected to "bootstrap" themselves out of this. Whether this is because of privileges  (racial, class, physical/mental ability, or other) or just because of their nature as i mentioned above, it doesnt really matter. 
Whichever one you choose the result is the same. It's all happening as a result of capitalism. That's proof enough that it doesnt work in the real world.
@_date: 2018-02-07 14:43:33


Plenty of ink has been spilled on this. You don't need me to provide an argument when you can do the research yourself if you so desire. But regardless of whether Adam Smith advocated a free market (he didn't), let alone thought them possible (he didn't), the "free market" has never existed and can never exist. The market requires legislation that prevents "rational" corporate behaviour which would otherwise undermine it, and any regulator (such as a state) will always be corrupted by corporations seeking to influence them.


Socialism and fascism are polar opposites. Its only reactionaries on reddit who keep equating the two because theyre idiots who dont understand political philosophy, and theyre more concerned about being able to spout literal nazi rhetoric on a privately owned website or on college campuses than living in an actual police state.


Please point to where i suggested that. Nice propaganda though. 


Wrong, capitalism is a system that allows people who already have money to make even more money off the labor of others, who stay stuck in a treadmill of wage slavery. If you really think capitalism is the greatest system then you have to also believe that the reason 90% of the world lives in relative poverty is because theyre unable to navigate markets with and that this is their fault rather than a failure of the system itself. 


I agree with this part actually, what the US is right now, is the inevitable consequence of capitalism. Theres no state that doesnt follow this same pattern of corruption and regulatory capture, its what always happens when wealth is allowed to concentrate in fewer hands.


I'd say thats exaclty what capitalism is, and if your idea of "pure" capitalism is stateless capitalism, well good luck with your fantasy land. Let me know when you get rid of all the governments. Also this: 


Neither of those places have much freedom, I wouldn't want to live there. If that's capitalism then I'm even more confident saying it doesnt work.


Crypto is not capitalism because no one is using their capital that they either inherited, or stole, or exploited others to amass, to pay others a pittance so they can exctract the excess profits of their labor to enrich themselves. Crypto is more like what existed *before* capitalism when there was common land that everyone could live off of, before the wealthy enclosed it and claimed private ownership of it. Anyone can get into crypto with even a small amount of money. Land ownership, business ownership, traditional investing, all of these require small fortunes to begin with if you really want to succeed. That's why crypto is revolutionary. And I know youre going to spout some rhetoric about bootstraps and small business owners, but its bullshit because the vast majority of small businesses fail, and even the ones who succeed require far more time and energy to get started, unless of course you have tons of money to start with. Saying that this is a good way to run a society is on a par with saying that the lottery is a good way for people to become successful. While its technically true that it works for some people, the successes are too few and far between to really be considered a viable system.
@_date: 2018-02-06 21:22:57
I think a lot of people confuse greed/corruption for stupidity. Politicians arent usually stupid people, and when they spout rhetoric that makes them sound that way its likely they dont even believe it themselves. 
I assume a lot of politicians already understand crypto at least enough to know they really cant stop it
@_date: 2018-02-07 15:16:55


People need food and shelter. Not everyone can live off of mommy and daddy until their business takes off.


And yet every capitalist state results in that same type of corruption and market manipulation. I'd love for you to point out a time when this didnt happen. 


On paper yes. In reality, no.


And where is the market force that dictates this behavior? Charity is simply not part of capitalism. Its something that capitalists think will 'just happen' once the rich have enough tax breaks. Talk about rainbows and unicorns...


Its also an ideology that governs every country in the world currently.


Most European and Nordic countries have a version of capitalism that has more 'socialist' tendencies and people generally have better quality of life and work/life balance there.


Except its not, see the countries I mentioned. Funny how if anyone mentions capitalism's problems, people always jump in with "well go live in socialist north korea/Venezuela!!" But they don't say Finland, Sweden, Norway, etc.
 &gt;I’m not defending corporations running the country or big bloated government making our decisions for us. I am libertarian and I believe that people should make their own damn decisions and live with their own damn consequences. Now when your decisions affect me, that becomes a problem, and that’s where government comes in. When your rights interfere with my rights, you don’t have that right.
See companies buying carbon credits, aka the "right" to pollute the air everyone has to breathe and water everyone has to drink. Thats the market solution, and its shitty. See also Nestle buying up water.  Thats going to turn out great....
 &gt;People whine and complain water sitting there typing on their iPhone that was created by an idea sold at a fair price where to billion people can afford it. 
By people who commit suicide because theyre being exploited. Neolibs love to gush like we owe every single one of our technological advancements over the last century to capitalism, conveniently forgetting that it was publicly funded research programs that did the lion's share of the work. 
Capitalism doesn't make new things. It privatizes advancements that the rest of us have already paid for so a few people can become outrageously wealthy. 


Typical hand-waving. Yup, any criticism of capitalism is just millenials whining, what a fresh original argument, lol


Yup, you can always buy from a different company or work a different job, which will be just as shitty as the one you left. If people could opt out they would, people participate in capitalism because there literally is no other option. True freedom baby!!
