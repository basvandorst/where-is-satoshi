You can’t really sell people on just bitcoin alone.  Thats like selling people to buy just one type of insurance.  Cryptocurrencies are great but blockchain is where the value starts.  Bitcoin was the beginning of a “revolution”.  Everyday more and more people are hearing about Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum or the blockchain.  As more people research it, the more they learn about it.  They now test their feet in the waters which ultimately makes bitcoin stronger.  Big and small companies are now adopting the blockchain.  I do recall Jamie Dimon calling it a bubble one month and turning around later with his company (possibly) getting into futures.  Bitcoin isnt just a cryptocurrency but a brand name which is turning into a household name.  People dont know cryptocurrencies but they do know bitcoin.  Somehow I just went off subject and abit and think its time to go to sleep.  3:20am

I would generate a new one and transfer the coins.  No point in risking it
