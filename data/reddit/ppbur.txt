You hope it’s a store of value...
@_date: 2018-01-28 15:56:47
But you’re free to do it.
@_date: 2018-01-17 11:23:43
Keep dreaming
@_date: 2018-01-16 09:51:06
If btc isn’t a store of value anymore, what is it ?
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:30:09
Why would it ever hit 10k again? Not a store of value, not digital gold, not a currency, not an efficient way to send money.
@_date: 2018-01-05 11:40:52
Can’t be a store of value if it doesn’t have any intrinsic value. The price isn’t based on fundamentals but on speculation.
@_date: 2018-01-16 09:47:41
Bitcoin isn't ever going to back up. Stupid money is getting scared. Without the new influx of money and without any inherent use for btc, it's going down.
@_date: 2018-01-16 12:52:59
Then it is not sinking...
@_date: 2018-01-16 12:44:19
How so ?
@_date: 2018-01-28 15:49:53
The libertarian in you should let the cc companies do the fuck they want. You’re free to find another service provider.
@_date: 2018-01-23 21:30:34
@_date: 2018-01-11 09:07:26
If people stop believing that it is a store a value, it will never go back up as a BTC isn't useful for anything else.
@_date: 2018-01-05 19:59:00
But those qualities can be attributed to about "any"crypto. (I didn't read the link yet)
@_date: 2018-01-16 10:11:15
It doesn’t work as a currency or a way to send money in any efficient way at all. Gold price isn’t volatile. You don’t risk loosing 30% of value in a heartbeat. It isn’t a very good store of value if you have to wonder if it is the right time to store your money...
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:21:47
Will we see under 10 k?
@_date: 2018-01-16 12:46:06
Is it sinking or not? Because if its is, I'll leave with the rats.
@_date: 2018-01-17 11:53:12
This is good for btc.
@_date: 2018-01-17 11:37:48
You’re delusional if you think bitcoin will ever replace fiat.
@_date: 2018-01-16 09:55:16
All you guys have been saying for months that btc isn’t a currency anymore but is a store of value, digital gold. You know because a currency works.
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:37:22
When you market order, you go up or down the book. It is what creates the price movement. If people only made limit orders, the price wouldn't move.
@_date: 2018-01-06 08:37:53
Yes price is based on supply and demand but value and price aren't the same thing. That's why something can be overvalued when overbought or undervalued when oversold.
@_date: 2018-01-17 11:48:15
Bitcoin doesn’t have any fundamentals.
@_date: 2018-01-07 23:20:11
Take off your jacket!
@_date: 2018-01-17 11:20:36
Acceptance for what? Store of value?

I’m crypto interested and I don’t believe BTC has any inherent value (in its actual form).
@_date: 2018-01-28 16:33:12
You're only missing 2 things: expertise and capital. 
Anyway, I was just pointing out the ridiculousness of his libertarian point of view.
@_date: 2018-01-16 09:59:51
I hope btc will still be relevant when this scaling solution arrives. Best to you.
@_date: 2018-01-23 09:05:38
Do any if those things actually work or are being used?
@_date: 2018-01-17 11:39:28
Don’t pay in btc or you might never get your coffee. Maybe we can keep a tab open.
@_date: 2017-12-04 22:39:46
I agree. Let's look for a future in which you shut the fuck up.
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:57:26
True, but Are banks allowed to hold these assets ?
@_date: 2017-12-31 09:07:03
None as it has become basically useless. The price is solely derived from speculation.
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:09:23
Sorry for being obnoxious.
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:35:53
If that's the case, then when confidence is shaken, btc will go to shit.
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:10:58
Never go full retard! :)
@_date: 2017-12-27 10:39:24
So it’s only an idea because, in practice, it isn’t available to everyone and it doesn’t work as a currency.
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:40:32
Is this the bubble popping?
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:40:54
Price and value aren't the same thing.
@_date: 2017-12-31 11:01:58
What makes you think the bubble has finished popping? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:59:31
That's the reason why dictionaries aren't used to study finance and that they make finance textbooks.
You can learn something new everyday if you want to.  :)
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:51:52
You can start here: 
@_date: 2017-12-31 09:56:35
No, there is some value that can be based on the network effect, the fact that it has the 1st mover advantage and there may be other factors. 
But there is little remaining value based on its functional aspects.
According to you, what are the fundamentals of BTC and how much are they worth? How much of the price is based on speculation?
@_date: 2017-12-11 11:49:48
Economics by John Sloman. Used around the world to teach Econ 101.
@_date: 2017-12-31 09:28:54
I don’t believe the price is reflecting the value at this moment. So, basing its utility on price isn’t pertinent to me.
No, I cannot determine the fundamental value as nobody can. But as it is not usable as payment method or to transfer money anymore, the fundamentals should be based on its « store of value » properties which is basically confidence. 
If the confidence is ever shaken, I don’t see where the value would reside anymore.
There is no need for any animosity towards me for having an opinion.
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:37:21
The bitcoin futures market is settled in cash.
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:48:47
Yes, if you had studied some finance, you'd know it.
@_date: 2017-12-31 10:22:09
Where did you get the impression that I thought it was only possible to buy a full coin?
@_date: 2017-12-31 09:35:26
IMO, I’m pretty sure that confidence will be shaken and render the btc worthless. But that’s just an opinion.  
@_date: 2017-08-06 08:28:39
If you think bitcoin has any value without FIAT, you are delusional. It only has value because you can transfer it back to fiat. Majority of people are not buying it to replace the Fiat system, but as an investment like stock. 
Why do you think when people reach a couple of million dollars, they cash out ? Because people prefer security, ease of use, something stable, something you can use in the real world...
If the USA made it impossible to change bitcoin to dollars, BTC would become almost worthless.
@_date: 2017-08-22 23:56:44

The technology might be disruptive, it might be the future but Bitcoin might not be. Thus, the gamble.
@_date: 2017-11-03 00:00:43
Yeah, but betting all your net worth on one trade is stupid. Even stupider if using margin.

Sorry, it’s Brussels which is the capital of Belgium which is the capital of Europe.
@_date: 2017-11-02 23:54:57


@_date: 2017-11-06 19:13:52
They tax the shit out of working people. 50% for the highest bracket. There are no capital gains but dividends are taxed at 30%. Belgium also has very high inheritance taxes, but it’s “possible” to get around them.
@_date: 2017-11-03 00:06:42
So, in the event he had put it all on a single number on the roulette and won, it wouldn't be stupid because it paid off ?
@_date: 2017-11-06 13:17:23
Live in a country that doesn't have taxes on capital gains.
Edit: don't be American.
@_date: 2017-11-06 16:56:38
Google it mother fucker.
@_date: 2017-11-24 15:58:59
This so stupid. Drugs don’t rely on the banking system to get money in and out. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 14:11:32
Not sure about taxation on crypto because it’s a grey area, but Belgium, the capital of Europe, doesn’t tax capital gains on securities or on houses. So Belgium is shady ?
@_date: 2017-11-06 13:22:17
From a financial point of view, the first rule is diversification.
@_date: 2017-11-06 17:58:37
I meant EU. Generally, when you talk about Europe in any other context than in a geographical one, EU is implied.

@_date: 2017-11-06 13:28:29


Majority of people automatically assume you're an idiot.
@_date: 2017-11-06 19:42:27
Just to add, there are no capital gains but losses are not deductible.
@_date: 2017-11-06 19:41:32
Wages are taxed separately from other forms of revenue. The  brackets for wage taxation are the following :
First 8,350 € : 25 %
from 8,350 € to 11,890 € : 30%
from 11,890 to à 19,810 € : 40%
from 19,810 € to 36,300 € : 45%
from 36,300 € : 50%
@_date: 2017-11-24 16:14:44
You’re delusional.
@_date: 2017-11-06 17:29:52
“Brussels in Belgium is considered the de facto capital of the European Union”. Even if it’s not official, this is the first line of your article.
They don’t want to declare its brussels because they don’t want to hurt France’s feelings with Strasbourg. ( I’m just saying this)
@_date: 2018-02-05 23:40:19
My pleasure.
@_date: 2018-02-01 10:56:11
It's never a good idea to try and catch a falling knife. What's the percentage of people which will buy near the bottom? 
As it's not possible to calculate the fundamentals, the only thing you can rely on is trend and confidence. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 21:38:06
We're going sub 5k.
@_date: 2018-02-04 16:28:55
Except all the normies/speculators won't be back to lift up the price again.
@_date: 2017-09-30 19:41:41
It could be banned through the banking system.
@_date: 2018-02-01 14:17:39
You were stating that btc price was driven by technology, I was just disagreeing.
If or when the btc fade passes, then it will be more clear what the fundamentals are worth.
@_date: 2018-02-01 11:01:29
We don't know how bitcoin will hold up during a recession.
@_date: 2018-02-01 09:12:09
Your comment is stupid. Institutional money can't invest in BTC.
@_date: 2018-02-01 14:06:45
Price was mostly driven by greedy speculators. Nobody in the real world knows what lightening or Segwit is. One is barely used and other one... 
All the speculators who don’t give a shit about technology are all jumping ship seeing that btc is losing steam.
Only people supporting the price are early investors which already have gains and think they are buying btc cheap because they think it is a bargain now when they are actually throwing good money after bad.
@_date: 2017-09-27 23:23:32
You'll never get any mass adoption if the only way to trade crypto is through local physical markets.
@_date: 2017-09-30 20:19:51
Let’s say the US government could ban any banks from transacting with crypto exchanges. No more money going in or out.
@_date: 2017-09-30 20:24:18
Do you know how many banks have interests in the US or use dollars ?
@_date: 2017-09-28 00:00:45
Because they do not hold any power of those things. The US has power over any bank which have interests in the US, banks dealing with US dollars and more or less any bank in the EU. Don’t you know that US policy has forced European banks to disclose if any US citizens hold any accounts in Europe. This is enforced by sovereign European countries.
@_date: 2018-02-01 14:20:51
True, but my point was that it was almost insignificant on the price change.
@_date: 2017-09-27 23:40:06
The US is powerful enough to potentially block banks from dealing with crypto in the entire western world.
@_date: 2018-02-05 23:36:11
We don't care that you didn't ask us to agree, we're just pointing out 
that what you said is stupid.
@_date: 2017-10-31 22:28:40
What about investing ?
@_date: 2017-09-28 09:31:07


They would probably consider a ban when crypto begins to impair the functioning of the state and if it starts to become a mainstream alternate currency.  Why would they try to enforce a international ban (related to banks) ? To kill crypto, because it would have no effect to only ban it in the US alone. 
I'm don't live in the US and I don't think highly of their institutions but I can see the effects of how long the the US' reach is over international banking regulations and on our (European) governments. Banks comply, firstly because they don't want to be blocked out of the US market and secondly because our governments enforce it. 
@_date: 2017-09-27 23:13:02
It would be much easier than that. Just block all banks from dealing with crypto exchanges. No more inflow or outflow of money anymore.
@_date: 2018-02-04 16:27:02
Capitulation phase hasn't even started yet.
@_date: 2018-02-01 11:00:09
It seems that the sell off happened on other exchanges (I only checked Kraken) while GDAX was offline.  
So it seems, that it isn't related to GDAX.
@_date: 2017-09-28 00:12:58
That’s not the point. The point is they can enforce foreign banks in foreign countries to comply with US regulations. They don’t need to ban protocols, they just have to ban banks from sending or receiving money from exchanges.
I’m not saying they will ban it, I’m just stating that the US could possibly cripple crypto badly without too much effort.
@_date: 2018-02-05 21:41:06
So you've been spewing bullshit for 5 months?
@_date: 2017-10-23 08:25:22
State that it isn’t a stock and then goes on to compare it to a stock. But I agree, it isn’t a stock.
@_date: 2018-02-01 09:15:57
They could both be wrong. 
@_date: 2015-03-02 20:01:06
If you have stacks of cash, Belgium is the place to be in western Europe. 0% taxes on cash (any amount), 0% on capital gains.
