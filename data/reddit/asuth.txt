Would he have insta downvoted, and responded with, "People are buying graphics cards en masse-sometimes in batches of 10 or more-solely for Bitcoin mining." if that was the case, or would he have written a reasonable response like you did explaining that "Bitcoin" as a synonym for crypto was the issue?
Or is it more likely he has no clue what he is talking about?

Were you also saying the same stuff when it crashed from $30 to $3, then suddenly you had nothing to say for 2 years, then when it crashed from $1000 to $200 you suddenly once again have a PhD in finance, then you go silent for another few years, and then today when it crashes from 18k to 11k you're once again wielding a crystal ball and have earned your second PhD in market bubbles?
Cause those are the people who are annoying lol.
Also, if in one year its back up at 25k will you admit that blockchain technology is new and potentially disruptive and no one really knows its real market value yet and the volatility in the price reflects that.

I hate to be that guy, but honestly this is a really small dip and the scamming is very limited compared to MT Gox or the last altcoin bubble popping.  Bitconnect was one of the more blatant ponzi schemes I've ever seen whereas MT Gox was literally the biggest exchange that existed.
I know this crash is really tough to swallow if you are new to bitcoin, but trust me MT Gox was just a completely different level for everyone who had coins on there.  The more experienced people always kept their funds off exchange, but many many people lost it all to MT Gox scamming and even those who actually held their own coins lost ~80% of their USD value.
Imagine today if coinbase went belly up and everyone who kept their funds on coinbase was broke and BTC went down to 3K.  That is about what it was like.  There are posts in basically every day telling people to keep their coins in a wallet and not on coinbase but this sub is full of idiots who don't listen or learn.
The fact that you think this is anything like that is just insane.

You know that bitcoin is mined with custom asiics that are good for little else?  Consumer PC parts are not being used to mine bitcoin.  All the graphics card cost issues are from Ethereum and other alts.
If you try and mine bitcoin with pc gaming hardware you'll won't make enough to pay back the hardware cost and in most places, lose money every day on the electricity.
The amount of redditors blaming bitcoin on their graphics card cost is insane.  
Edit: Downvote away if you don't like the facts and truth but you are just flat out wrong.

Its certainly easier to be brave when you don't invest more than you can afford to lose so you are right on that count.  Regardless of amount, I made a conscious decision to purchase a high-risk long term investment in a technology that I believe will change the world in 5-10 years.  It would be completely irrational to check the price every day and second guess that decision when I expect the impact to the technology to be minimal for some time.  About once I year I review the state of the tech, rebalance into some alts, other than that I hodl.

I understand their frustration, using BTC doesn't feel the way it used to.  It feels really slow and really expensive.  When that happens to something you really cared about you look for someone or something to blame.  They latched on to blockstream fairly or not.
I also don't think their technology argument is completely wrong.  I honestly think that we would all be better off if BTC had 2MB blocks today and maybe even 8mb blocks.  I hated the NYA and the backdoor politics and the bullshit, but I also haven't heard a single valid argument for why 2MB blocks wouldn't be better than what we have right now as an interim improvement.

You can ALWAYS look at the transaction on the block chain using blockchain.info or similar.  You can also look up any address and see what it holds.  This is an example that I think is from an address held by one of the exchanges: 
If you use a trezor/nano or electrum it will just show you your balance (often in USD as well if you like)  Think of a wallet dashboard as an interface to display blockchain data about your address(es) to you.
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:55:47
basically yes
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:21:47
The specifics depend on the exchange but you need to approximately
1)  Get a wallet, store the recover seed securely somewhere
2)  Get a receive address from your wallet
3)  Find the withdrawl button on the exchange
4)  Enter your wallet receive address
5)  Wait a while, within a a few hours (or a day if there is a big clog) you will see your funds in a wallet.

I've only ever posted there like 5 times, but I put this up yesterday and while not every response was reasonable, plenty of people definitely engaged in a rational discussion: 
I think there are a lot of less vocal people on both sides who just want bitcoin to feel like magic internet money again.  I don't think BCH is really the answer, but I think that from a usability perspective core has to admit that they are failing as of today and I know I personally am frustrated that at a time when bitcoin is getting such amazing mainstream attention that the technology is not in a state to really wow first time users :/
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:08:38
I guess my feeling is I held through MT Gox crash.  I fully believe another major price correction will come in the next 12 months, but I don't believe I will accurately time the market to predict when or why so I follow a buy and hold strategy both with stocks and with BTC.  
My question is:
Why do you think bitcoin recovered from MT Gox, but won't recover from the next crash?
Why did it recover from the 2013 crash but won't recover from the next?
I completely agree we are in a state of mania but I am not a short term investor, I care about 5 years from now and it seems odd to me that people think the next crash will be the last without acknowledging the past price crashes or stating why this time is different.  What is particularly funny about this is there is even a good argument to be made for why this time is different (there is a lot of altcoin competition that might take advantage of a crash and supplant BTC) but the talking heads calling it a bubble are too uninformed to even consider this point.
I would not shocked if the price of bitcoin is 3K at some point next year and maybe even for a long time after, we've seen 80% crashes in price before.  But bitcoin actually dying without a new alt coin replacing it is something I am highly skeptical of.

I agree to an extent (fwiw I also have a masters in economic theory so I am of course aware of the efficient market hypothesis).  
I think there is some question of whether we are in the stage of institutional investors entering, or of retail investors entering.  By most estimates, less than 15% of people in America have ever owned any bitcoin and a huge percentage of investers holdings are &lt; 1K.  There is no easy way to put it into a retirement plan, buy an ETF of it, etc which is where the average retail investor puts significant money.  Its market cap is much less than 1 trillion, a tiny fraction of gold, or internet stocks, or mortage backed securities, or even a single large company.  Its less than half the market cap of facebook.
I see the opening of futures trading, SEC regulation, etc as the 2nd phase that you described, more than the third.

I wish people who can time the market the best, I don't consider myself one of those people.  Furthermore, there are complexities around taxes to consider.
I think that people who do that spread their funds across a variety of exchanges to reduce risk and then split their holdings across varies currencies and shift between them basic on market changes.

There is a 2015 bitfurry paper but it was written when fees / congestion weren't a problem, people were using 2015 hardware, and they assumed no one would upgrade their hardware and that random raspberry pi's need to be full nodes.
The result was that even 1MB blocks would drive 40% of the nodes out of the market in a short time frame.  However, we have far more full nodes today than we did then. 
They say, ""However, high transaction fees could reduce the incentive to use Bitcoin for micropayments, remittances, and international payments. Increasing the block size could lead to additional strain on the nodes of the Bitcoin network. The most computationally expensive operation during transaction relay is verification of the ECDSA signatures of the transaction inputs (each transaction is verified before it is relayed to other nodes in order to protect the network from DoS attacks). Modern CPUs are able to verify several thousand transactions per second [11]. Thus, current transaction throughput of several tps is not much of a burden for the network.""
No one has researched it since that.  The community has decided that 1MB is a magic number for no real reason afaik.
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:41:25
People said similar about MtGox at the time.
Furthermore, coinbase is VERY slow at giving users access to their forked coins.  Coinbase users still don't have their BTG which people who hold their own keys got to sell early for 2x what it is worth now.
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:42:53
The difficulty is driven by market forces based on the price of BTC vs the price of electricity.  People will mine when its profitable, but the network doesn't need more mining to process more transactions at the moment, it just makes a 51% attack more expensive.  Electricity is also not easily portable across long distances without heavily loss so just counting it in terms of units used isn't really accurate.
All that said, I do value energy efficiency, and in the future I see the lightning network solving or a shift from BTC to a more efficient altcoin or a compromise with the BTC mining community on a more energy efficient POW algorithm (which is why I would always recommend a diversified crypto portfolio) all as solutions.  I view a superior altcoin emerging as the biggest threat to bitcoin.  I don't think Ethereum or LTC are it though.

The transaction fee is whatever you decide to set it to, you just might have to wait longer.  If exchanges are charging high fees that is the exchanges choice.
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:48:33
If you have a large sum I'd invest in a trezor or a nano ledger.  If its a small amount I'd use a free wallet like electrum.  Given the current network congestion, I might let the BTC mempool clear out a bit to cut down on fees before you withdraw.  You can see it spiked on the 8th and is slowly coming back down: 
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:38:25
Its actually pretty easy just stop checking the price, ignore bitcoin and come back in a year.  That's what I did in the past.  Its also easier to hodl if you don't keep your coins on an exchange, which is just prudent security wise anyways.  Those of us who survived MtGox learned that the hard way.  Far to many noobs today need to learn that lesson.
If you believe in bitoin hodl is actually very easy.  If you don't then you should just sell today.
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:03:42
Found the paper: 
However, it is from 2015 and a fair amount of their logic doesn't really hold today and it seemed like at the time of writing that the transaction volume was low enough that the network was never congested anyways.
high transaction fees could reduce the incentive to use Bitcoin for micropayments, remittances, and
international payments.
Increasing the block size could lead to additional strain on the nodes of the Bitcoin network. The
most computationally expensive operation during transaction relay is verification of the ECDSA signatures
of the transaction inputs (each transaction is verified before it is relayed to other nodes in order
to protect the network from DoS attacks). Modern CPUs are able to verify several thousand transactions
per second [11]. Thus, current transaction throughput of several tps is not much of a burden for
the network."
They say that 1MB blocks would exclude 25% of the nodes over 6 months while 2MB blocks would exclude 50%.  A look at the number of listening nodes here:  does not suggest that we have lost 25% of nodes over the last 2 years.  We have actually gained a lot of nodes.

The bitcoin bubble has popped at least 3 times and generally the price has stabilized afterwards at massive year over year gains.  That is the difference between bitcoin and tulips.
No one denies that price bubbles happen and that bitcoin is likely in one.  The question is “does BTC have long term value as an invention” and surviving multiple massive crashes (from 30 to 3 and from 1300 to 200 and several other smaller crashes) only to emerge stronger each time is a pretty strong affirmative answer. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 00:15:35
A trezor/ledger are in the 50-100$ range.  The issue is the relative cost of the security vs the value of what you are protecting.  If you are spending $100 to protect $100 dollars that would be silly as you are incurring a guaranteed cost equal to what you'd lose if your coins happen to get stolen.  The exact point where you have enough to want to purchase a ledger/trezor to protect it is a personal decision. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 05:05:59
Do you realize the vast majority of the coins belong to the early adopters? 90% of the new holders may not give a shit but they don't control even 10% of the currency. We were fine without them a year ago and we'll be fine after they move on to the next get rich quick scheme.

Quit your job, live off of &lt; 50k/year and sell off enough to get exactly 50k/yr in gains.  Then pay that sweet 0% capital gains income tax rate that the lower income brackets enjoy.  Also don't sell any coins you bought within the last year to avoid getting hit by short-term gains rather than long term.

You can pick either average cost accounting or SpecID accounting.  To get maximum tax efficiency, you need to document when you bought coins and when you sell you need to explicitly record which coin you sold.  
Usually you want to sell the coins you bought at the highest price first, the exception to this would be if those coins were bought within the last year as you never want to hit short term cap gains.

Really psyched to see you guys finally launch though, feel like infinity has been vapor ware for a long time :)
Wish you all the best, but I worry that a high rake is going to drain your early adopters to fast and hurt your chances of ever reaching enough of a player base to compete with SWC.
