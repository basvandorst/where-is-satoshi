Doesn't matter what year it is, open discussion and to be able to debate all aspects of a topic helps promote knowledge and growth of that subject, namely Bitcoin.

Absolutely, and I wish you guys the best of luck in this future endeavor. You guys in this subreddit including me have to separate what is the truth and what are lies. What I m getting at is that this subreddit and its community should not fall prey to confirmation bias. Not every criticism is an attack at Bitcoin and its community. Failure ain't bad especially if you take risks that none have taken before and that's some pioneering right there. I invest in some penny stocks and I can kinda relate to you guys in this struggle. There's money and time being invested, &amp; the last thing you wanna hear is bad news. But again, what I hope is that this community will keep an open mind and continue to do its research.

 It has nothing to do with easy or right for this discussion my man :D. For all I know, Bitcoin could be the future of currency as we know it. I know only very small basics on how these cryptocurrencies work. However, I do know that any subject worth its salt in researching and investing such as Bitcoin can stand criticism and different points of view to help expand its view. At the moment, I look not only the positive support in this subreddit, but also any different opinions as well. In short, I like to play devil's advocate and try to see from both sides.
