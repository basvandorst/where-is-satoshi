Minutes??  What Bitcoin are you using?

"Lend".  There is no actual crypto lending platform that I'm aware of. SALT is a collateral program.  It's gives you cash for the crypto you hold.

Yep, and because my salary is a bit less than him, I sometimes get a hint that he looks down upon me.  But, we're still close friends.  He's very open with me and I know how much he has saved and makes per year.   I've told him my positions and how much money I hold but he thinks it's all fake money that will disappear and crash in the aether of the internet.

I've told my friend about bitcoin a few times but he refuses to listen to me about it.  He thinks it's a big pyramid scheme scam but has no knowledge of the technology or desire to learn about it.  He thinks I'm stuck inside a big MLM scheme.  Fidelity getting on board with bitcoin might get him to rethink his positions a bit because that's who he invests with.  This is good news for us.

I look forward to the battle between Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Dollars, Bitcoin Money, and Bitcoin Gold.

I bought Decred and I'm holding that long term.  If there's one weakness Bitcoin has now that the scaling is solved (for now) is that miners have too much influence

That's why hybrid PoS/PoW is important.  Look into the coins using it.  Really cool governance work is being done.

You can deposit your bank funds into the gemini exchange with zero fees.  You buy bitcoin with 0.15% fee.  Coinbase forces you to purchase bitcoin like $10-20 higher than the current ask price with a susbstantial fee (anywhere from $2 and more depending on how much you buy)

Except the supply of Bitcoin is still inflating....

There's currently no way for anyone outside of Core to have any influence in Bitcoin's code.  That's why people resort to social media.  There's no way to truly know what the people who own Bitcoin actually want.  It's a problem that will continue to cause splits in the community.  Personally, I think it's bad for bitcoin to be constantly fracturing into smaller coins.  There are few coins working to solve that issue.  One with a working blockchains and on-chain votes.

There are way, way more than 4 billion Bitcoin addresses.

It's not decentralized if there's an escrow involved.  Government could create rules saying all escrow providers need to have detailed reasons for the escrow exchange and game over.
@_date: 2017-09-23 03:12:04
I explicitly mentioned vertcoin, did you read?  As said in someone else's comment, the code for vertcoin is functional, but not in a state to be released to the public.
@_date: 2017-09-23 12:31:49
If youre a newbie, it's probably not suited for you.  It's all command line at this point.  The decred people are released an updated wallet soon with this feature integrated into a GUI.

It's like moving money from your savings account to your checking account, except you actually own both.

The governance structure is probably Bitcoin's biggest weakness. To get anything done, it takes years of people screaming at each other on twitter only to result in several new bitcoins.  It's hashing algorithm is also incredibly power hungry without any benefit to society.  
@_date: 2018-02-24 09:36:59
Satoshi, with his holdings, could easily push the price below $500.
@_date: 2017-09-22 22:38:59
Right now it's limited to BTC, LTC, Decred (the decred developers are the ones who actually wrote all the code), and Vertcoin.  Other coins have reached out to the Decred team to incorporate themselves in the atomic swapping network.

Bitcoin has weaknesses, lots of them.

Republicans, the party of "fiscal responsibility" my ass.   All they want is more money in their own filthy pockets.

Fiat is, by definition, "currency that a government has declared to be legal tender, but it is not backed by a physical commodity.  Fiat currency is legal tender whose value is backed by the government that issued it."
Cryptocurrency is not fiat because 1. No government accepts Bitcoin as legal tender.  You can't pay your taxes in Bitcoin. 2.  No government controls Bitcoin.  New Bitcoin is issued based on a strict set of rules, not on the whim of a central bank.

The intrinsic value of gold is the same as Bitcoin. The only difference is gold has a tens of thousand year head start.

I'd love to see him move a btc from his wallet to another and back again.  Just to let us know he's still around.

With nicehash, people can point your hashing power at whatever pool they want.
@_date: 2018-02-01 04:16:15
That's what BitConnect did.
@_date: 2017-10-03 20:25:55
All the hash power you point to them goes on their market to be sold to the highest bidder.

Cash is more traceable than Bitcoin.  Perhaps he wants the money hidden from the government/wife?
@_date: 2017-07-23 20:17:26
I used the wrong word.  It's more 'anonymous'.  Until the time the government knows your wallet address, they don't know anything about your crypto finances. 
@_date: 2017-07-05 01:59:11
do you have a recommendation for what to use?
@_date: 2017-07-16 18:42:01
I highly doubt we'll even see $1500.  They only way we see $1000 is if there is some public controversy over Segwit.  At this point all signs point to a smooth Segwit2x transition.

What is a good exchange/wallet to use?  I currently have my funds in a Coinbase wallet.  I know for a fact that isn't the greatest place for my funds.
@_date: 2017-06-26 22:29:19
Also, the normal person has no fucking idea what a Satoshi is.  Bitcoin will never be mainstream until all that stuff is hidden from the user.
