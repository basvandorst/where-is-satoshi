3 and not 10. At least in my country. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 07:26:45
I hope the newbies understand what you implying. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 15:41:15
What a puppet...

I pray you recover soon. Your hodling won't go in vein
@_date: 2017-12-15 18:13:35
In India it's twice the price. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 10:54:45
How is volume (24h) calculated? 
@_date: 2017-11-22 17:34:38
Sell this off. And put the money in BTC. You may still be able to buy 2.in few years 
@_date: 2017-11-25 10:29:32
This guy should have more upvotes. Attention to details. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 17:39:09
My 3 lines about this.
1) 200 BTC - True
2) The rest of the part - just made up.
Sorry, but this is what I feel.

Spoofing? 
@_date: 2017-09-08 20:24:11
Buy the dip, as most Chinese still think it is true and are panic selling. Prices may go up again tomorrow. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 03:34:25
No. Buy and sell is not enabled for coinbase in India. You can use the wallet though, buy sending via exchanges.
@_date: 2017-09-14 08:46:59
Yes another fud. Time since all this FUDs can be seen here: 
@_date: 2017-09-15 03:34:41
Couldn't agree more. Zebpay user here. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 04:58:27
Agree, and thus reason I bought
@_date: 2017-09-03 17:53:04
So I used this online Validator to verify if my bitcoin receive address is valid or not.
It says it is invalid. What do I do next? Is the address country specific? Or am I missing something here?

Created this and posted link here, but the mods 'silently' removed it (no reason mentioned though) 
@_date: 2017-09-20 02:44:43
u/AstarJoe sir, any feedback?

@_date: 2017-09-08 20:18:41
China is not banning. It was a rumor /fake news
@_date: 2017-09-11 15:31:18
Haha. India is nowhere close to having a btc atm yet. 
@_date: 2017-09-03 17:59:23
Tried this link. Says it is valid.
@_date: 2017-09-03 17:59:35
Thanks

Slayer baby! \m/
@_date: 2017-10-22 09:52:06
I use this. 
@_date: 2017-09-11 15:29:25
Zebpay has wallet too. No need for a separate wallet. 
@_date: 2017-10-16 20:29:33
Eject eject

Pan Card. Do you have it yet? Or for start you can use your spouse's.
For exchange, I use changelly.com.
Since I did not find any other app/wallet in India from where I can directly buy other cryptocurrency (other than btc like ether, ltc) I have installed coinbase app and then transfer the new currency from changelly.com to coinbase address 
About poloniex, I'm not sure which app can be used. But the process will be same in general. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 14:59:54
So true. Not sure if all can understand this. But in one hindi news channel they said, and I quote 'Bitcoin Ka inventor, bitcoin lekar faraar'.
I was like really guys? Wtf?
I think it was India news or some other news channel. Do not remember it now.
And my parents moments after watching the news, 'Son, do not even think of buying any bitcoins'.
Indian media is so influential, but I guess it is just another channel controlled by the government. 
@_date: 2017-09-11 15:28:38
Not on pc. It's a phone application. You'll find your btc address in the app itself. Also forgot to mention, you need to complete KYC(some background check) by uploading your ID card. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 03:34:25

@_date: 2017-10-19 15:31:32
Yes. It is normal. And all previous addresses will still  be valid. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 04:58:27
Agree, and thus reason I bought
@_date: 2017-10-22 17:21:06
Trustable? Yes.
Profitable? Depends on how you trade, if you mean that. Very few options in India at the moment.
