nope. Too afraid of a bubble at $200. Then when it hit that, I was like "ok its GOT to be around $250. You can't go up $150 in 3-4 days without a bad thing happening. What goes up must come down. gonna get back in soon though!! scoop a ton of btc up when this crash hits its bottom.

the road is probably the best example of bitcoin in action though, no? 
(yes i realize he cant show this to his work lol)
@_date: 2013-04-03 20:55:23
hahaha. The price has fallen $30 now today from its peak.
I've now made $1,137 in profit. I'll scoop up again when they're $1 a piece :)

I sold a few days ago :) Of course I'll buy again. Last laugh? Why do a lot of you take this as a personal insult? I'm gonna buy when I see fit, don't worry. It's not about a "last laugh". It's about bitcoin, and it's viewed as a stock for some, or for the faithful, a long trip - "Either it will end up at $xxxxxx or $0" is what I have seen a lot.

SR (not to mention the other .onion marketplaces which are only growing), will always have a say in the price of bitcoin. These marketplaces are still, and probably will continue to be, the ONLY places who accept bitcoin exclusively. There are thousands of users on SR, I won't begin to estimate there. That amount of people buying bitcoin only to turn around and pump it straight into SR stimulates the btc economy a lot. When you have a SR hiccup, these thousands of people aren't using their btc or buying any more. This starts a chain reaction and the price falls. Like I said: SR will always have a large say in how BTC does. Hell, this last DoS brought the price from $140 to $117. Then it climbed to $123 over a few days of SR being steady again, then with these deposit delays it dropped to $100.Most people think that whoever did it was even doing it to game the BTC market. You think it's also coincidence that from February 2012 to August 2012 when the SR doubled in size, bitcoin experienced a 70% increase? I don't.

Oh I don't underestimate the illegal stuff. If that was gone, I wonder what would happen to BTC. 
@_date: 2013-04-03 21:00:48
thanks man! yeah i bought when they were at $14.50
and I'm just worried. mtgox servers are crashed still...not good.
@_date: 2013-04-03 21:06:17
it's only been like 12 weeks since it was at 14! 30 days ago it was at $33. 
This is my first experience. I rode the wave, and now it seems to be falling so im getting out. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 23:55:42
I meant legitimate in the sense that it will be accepted by businesses everywhere. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 00:12:13
I don't think it will be bitcoin. I think another currency will come along, take the awesomeness and innovation of bitcoin, and improve it somehow, and it will become the choice currency. It's as if bitcoin is a cool idea, but just a beta for something that may eventually be really great. The idea of decentralized currency is awesome, but is it really decentralized if mtgox essentially controls the market? It handles ~50% of all bitcoin transactions, correct? (seriously, correct me if im wrong. I'd like to be corrected and learn some!)
@_date: 2013-04-10 23:52:04
Everyone here wants so badly for bitcoin to be accepted everywhere. Denial, brah.
Also, I clearly stated the big block wasn't my words. So, of course it's not originally mine. Why downvote a different opinion? I'm posting something relevant to bitcoin said by another redditor so you guys can see. Jesus. God forbid someone think bitcoin isnt the greatest thing ever.

Silkroad dictates the bitcoin market so hard. It's where the majority of coins are spent. Silkroad was under a DoS attack recently, the price plummeted. And as of 2 days ago they started having deposit delay issues so nobody could access coins or spend them. The price fell from $123, to $100. Coincidence? No. .onion marketplaces are the only places that use bitcoin as currency on a large scale. When they hit a bump, the price hits a bump. There's unfortunately a lot of denial in this subreddit surrounding bitcoin. People refuse to believe that the SR and BMR and Atlantis are a large part of what's driving the price. That is where most coins get spent. Forbes estimated the SR alone makes $2,000,000 a month as of august 2012. the number of vendors was 550 then, its now around 750. ap im assuming theyre at about $3,500,000 a month now.That's a large share of the bitcoin market, at $42,000,000 in annual sales.

@_date: 2013-05-07 15:01:33
I don't understand why so many people think bitcoin actually has a shot in hell at actually being a widely used currency. Somebody please explain to me why they think so
