It's too bad this article is on a crypto site and not on something like Forbes or a major investment website. People, especially investors, tend to like tangible, concrete facts. Giving them something like this to hold onto could potentially give the crypto market a boost. 
I actually mentioned this to a couple non-crypto co-workers this morning when we were shooting the breeze and it piqued their interest because they didn't understand the supply scarcity.

Nope. I believe in the supply chain use cases of blockchain so I have invested in a couple of those focused projects.

100% concur on the rename.
For those that aren't religious, they'll find an alternative source out of spite. For those that are, they probably think Bitcoin is some mark of the beast shit and won't read it, either.

Deutsche Bank seems to be good at breaking the law.

No thanks. I’m not interested in having a taxable event every time I make a purchase. I’ll just hold onto what I’ve got until I’m ready to cash it all in.

Yep. Pat McAfee was talking about his first NFL booth experience and brought up talking to Rex Ryan about prepping for his pregame show where all of the folks would pick a team. Well the entire group picked the Patriots and someone had to pick the opponent so Rex was like "Fuck it, I'll take em" and proceeded to argue for the team knowing damn well they weren't likely to win. 
Media is nothing more than a shell game anymore because they have to generate controversy to draw eyeballs and outrage so they can sell ads.

While this is the first time I've read about the Casa, he's not wrong on his greater point. As a consumer, I've got subscription fatigue as pretty much everything has gone the way of a subscription-based model.

Video won’t play for me. Does it answer why they need another coin?

There have been several seized BTC auctions conducted by the US Marshals related to the Silk Road marketplace IIRC.

Haven’t several Americans had their BTC seized?

When they were getting ready to launch G+, their algo completely wrecked a lot of discussion forums so it's not always political -- sometimes it can be if they're going to be launching a service.

I hate to be that guy and fly in the face of "not your keys, not your coins" but if you ever want true wide scale market adoption and usage, end users will have to be able to use and trust centralized entities in the space. The overwhelming majority of the general public is just too lazy, not technically saavy enough, etc. 
If they're willing to offload the risk to these exchanges, you should be thankful that they're at least participating. Otherwise, this continues to remain a niche market.

Or they could have just watched the video to get the context.

You're not wrong but he is very pro-crypto. He is also into several alts like Vechain as well.

She built her channel to over 8 million subs and leveraged her channel into Ipsy. I'd say she has done pretty damn well off of hitting that make account button.

Aldi. Canned goods and ramen but I ate for months in college cheap. Dented rav cans were like a dime.

Ease of use for the average Joe. Each transaction being a taxable event in the US and some other countries. Those are a couple off the top of my head.

This. Buffet doesn't need to know about them, either, and that is also something that is lost on many of the people arguing both sides.
The bulk of Warren's knowledge was acquired when Coke still came in glass bottles and Chevy's were still made with sheet metal. He's always been a blue chip, long term investment guy. He's also said one of his key tenets is invest in what you understand and has based his strategy around Graham's intelligent Investor book that came on in 1949. 
I read the Snowball book about him back when it came out in 2008 and you could tell he was basically an autopilot investor at that point. While he still knows his shit, he's basically just a figurehead for Berkshire and his troves of underlings are the day-to-day folks doing the heavy lifting. Nobody should give two fucks what Warren thinks about Bitcoin or any emerging tech. 
I'd be much more interested to hear what his investment research team thinks about it. Let's also not ignore the fact that BH owns stake in Goldman Sachs, American Express, Mastercard and a slew of other banks and financial services companies so crypto isn't exactly a welcomed idea if it were to steal valuation from any of those companies.
