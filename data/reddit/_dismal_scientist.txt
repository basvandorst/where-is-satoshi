 &gt; Think about what it would be like if Reddit housed a bitcoin bank and instead of the kludgy method of tipping you could just, oh, I don't know, DIRECTLY tip someone and it would go into their account.
It would get fucking robbed.

As a potential economic user, who cares? It's still not working.

So is making selling heroine illegal, but it still deters the casually curious.

They could still do it. The benefit from being able to control the money supply probably outweighs the advantages for the government.

 &gt; There are also transaction fees, so the theory is that when bitcoin is used enough the volume of transaction fees will replace the lost block reward.
How computationally intense is the process of contributing to transaction validation? Does it depend on another factor, like the number of transactions or the fee percent?
