It worked though. My dad STILL has his AOL email address.

hmm. I had three "good ideas" and they were all available... its like the new domain land rush!

Sign her up for coinbase, put a few coins in her wallet, let her buy something with overstock.com, and see if she wants to investigate more for herself about this "internet money". If not, bitcoin probably isn't for her. If so, she'll probably have her eyes opened like the rest of us to the possibilities  (and perils) of dealing with the emerging new paradigm.

I want some of what you are smoking. Then an order of THE BIG COIN!

It was probably those 2 coinbase transactions that I used to clear out my Wells Fargo checking account that set off the alarm bells ;)

And that was the last we heard of NeutralSpine. Spent his last bitcoin on virtual hay they reckon.

The year is 1995. Why would I send an "electronic mail" when I can put a 25 cent stamp on an envelope and drop it in a mailbox?

Nature's first green is gold,
Her hardest hue to hold.
Her early leaf's a flower;
But only so an hour.
Then leaf subsides to leaf,
So Eden sank to grief,
So dawn goes down to day
With bitcoin I will pay.

Because whatever percentage of the cell phone market share they hold is vital to bitcoin becoming massively adopted.

hmm, this isn't really the same thing but you gave me an interesting thought. remember those "pull tab" phone number flyers people post all over? Why not do the same thing but with QR codes you could pull off and take with you to scan later. I'm selling my condo right now and I'm going to post a few of these around! Thanks for the idea!

I bet you could find $445 selling stuff around your house. Then buy a bitcoin!

To be honest, adoption rates of the new OS are usually so high that it doesn't make financial sense to continue supporting older OS versions. It takes time and effort to code, debug, and test for each version and with only 10% or so of users holding out for whatever reason, well it would be nice to have you as a user, but the 70 cents the developer gets from your purchase isn't going to put food on the table having to support your older OS.

I always said I'd buy in once it fell to 500. And...I'm in! See you guys on the moon.

Oh, no I meant I want to see new offers that I can participate in. Currently I still see all the apps I've already downloaded. If it dosen't already I think you should remove offers that have been completed from the list so its easier to find new offers. I am on iOS.

When will then be now?

hmm how do I sign up as an advertiser?
@_date: 2013-12-21 13:45:24
Just a heads up this already exists. I had the exact same idea yesterday and went looking in the app store. Sure enough someone beat us to the punch. Of course they are charging $1.99 for it so if you make it free and open source I would certainly be interested in using your app!
A feature I'd want is an alert when it reaches a certain price. For example I want to buy if it dips below $XXX. send me an alert!

Sounds like an Australian Jerry Seinfeld. Whats the deal with bitcoin?!

I think for most people they think of bitcoin kind of like "flooz" Remember flooz? Well no, not me either really...but it was one of those failed 90's startups that turned your real cash into internet money you could spend. "Thats what bitcoin, is right?" is what my girlfriend or parents would say for example. Its going to be difficult to get them on board with an aha moment if they don't have a technical background or high risk tolerance.

Great service! I actually made a post about wanting exactly this earlier today (bitcoin incentivized  app installs)! Is there anyway for the offers I've completed to be removed from the list? How often do they refresh?
