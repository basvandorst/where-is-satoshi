Yes, if you call create_new_address(for_change=1) - [Source code](
If you're on Windows or some such, you can just keep sending coins to your change addresses (even from the same wallet) and new ones will be derived.

No problem. If you keep using the oldest unused addresses that Electrum has generated (the ones nearest to the top in the *Addresses* tab), eventually you'll catch up with your other used addresses so you won't have to do that again.

It's an interesting idea. I would suggest that instead of requiring the transfer of funds, you require signatures. People sign a question with an address' key, and the more coins that their address can spend, the more "weight" the question receives.
So, if people want a question answered, they sign it and submit the signature, and whatever question has the most total coins controlled by its signers is what the developer answers. The downside here is that there is no incentive for developers to answer these questions since they don't get any funds. For it to work, it would require that developers are willing to check the status of questions on your site.
Also, you might need to keep track of signatures in a way that ensures one address can only be used to support one (two, five, twenty?) question at a time.

You could go with something general like "to promote innovation with Bitcoin and present solutions to problems that can be solved using the blockchain."
Your goals, then, would be to educate people on the unique possibilities that blockchains provide. For example, you might suggest proof-of-existence (i.e. putting data in the blockchain) to address a problem in which a permanent and immutable space is required to record something.
If a group creates a document, like the minutes of a meeting or something, you might inform them that they can store the hash of that document in the blockchain so that anyone reading in the future knows it hasn't been altered.

People upvoting this support Bitcoin and understand that these problems need to be discussed. People downvoting this are speculators that think hiding the problems will help their investment.

Commodities are not currencies. If it's one, it's not the other. And I think you're right. :\

IDK why people are pissed off about this guy doing his job. I'm a Bitcoin user, but the fact that I have spent money in exchange for bitcoin does not make me a customer of the Bitcoin developers.

I daresay this man's identity - and the very institution which he claims to chair - appear to be entirely fictitious. Wanton bamboozlery.
