They actually block pump and dump. Not organize it. Chineses want to do same kind of pump and dump than with Factom but Chinese doesn't get XCP if not buy from Poloniex.

Bitcoin users start also understand how much value Counterparty will give for Bitcoin. Later it is possible even miners will live mostly from Counterparty transactions

This game transaction making money also for Bitcoin miners. So far all transactions and burns:
"Counterparty have so far do in Bitcoin blockchain 477205 TXs and 49038 assets have created. Every every of this transaction have paid for miners 0.0001 BTC fee. This make together 47.72 BTC + 4.90 BTC fees for Bitcoin miners, over 50 BTC. When block reward go down and Counterparty transaction amount grow then this transactions are good way for miners earn more rewards. "
"Also, don't forget the 2124 BTC that were destroyed and taken out of circulation forever during the burn process. This is approximately equal to 1 out of every 7500 bitcoin in existence today, or 1 out of every 9888 bitcoin that will ever exist."

"Around 100 people created Counterparty tokens for this purpose alone in our estimation."
Sounds like marketing bullshit. Few 16 years old kids can register even more assets. Worth of $50.

Counterparty transactions aren't spam like Luke-Jr and his friends saying?

"I'm failing to articulate what is the positive here for BTC"
What more Counterparty transactions there are that more Bitcoin transactions and rewards for miners when block rewards going smaller.
