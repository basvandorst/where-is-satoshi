i think the first pic is misleading, the price should be above 18k  so it should be at least 18617.8 instead of 6178.

FFmpeg can grab the X11 display.
 	
ffmpeg -f x11grab -s cif -i :0.0 /tmp/out.mpg
0.0 is display.screen number of your X11 server, same as the DISPLAY environment variable.
 	
ffmpeg -f x11grab -s cif -i :0.0+10,20 /tmp/out.mpg
0.0 is display.screen number of your X11 server, same as the DISPLAY environment variable. 10 is the x-offset and 20 the y-offset for the grabbing.

@_date: 2019-06-25 13:38:37
you didnt read my post didnt you ? its the reality,  he bought drink and get 50% back,   he lament about how the time he spent to queue is not worth his cashback, however  about the 50% cashback ad, its 50% cashback he get.

25% is still better than 5% anyway,  there will always be fine print, but if they provide the product which can be bought and yield 50% cashback then its legit.
btw, i can tell my own experience about fake discount, once i goto furniture store and there a big ad about 70% discount,  so i pick one of the table which has price and discount symbol and ask the clerk, but it was not available in stock. in fact the only available stock is which has discount of 10% or less. now thats what i call a trick.
