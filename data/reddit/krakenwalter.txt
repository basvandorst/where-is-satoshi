Thank you for your interest!
While we strive to offer our services to all US residents, the cost of maintaining regulatory compliance in some states can be very high, forcing us to make hard choices about whether cost justifies doing business in the state. That said, if you want to prepare yourself for a potential expansion to Washington state, you can already open an account and submit verification details for any account level for pre-verification. If pre-verified, your account will be ready when regulations allow us to serve you in the future.
Should you have further questions or concerns in that regard, please feel free to contact us anytime.
