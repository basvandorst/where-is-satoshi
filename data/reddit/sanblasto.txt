The problem is that even if the news is posted in the last hour, they are talking about events that happened earlier in the day or the day before, which are almost always outdated by the time it gets submitted.

Ok, then what you meant was you were disappointed people don’t see the benefit of a decentralized vs a centralized money system. If you go back to your first post and replace “bitcoin/btc” with “gold bars”, you might see why that wasn’t clear.

I think it is also adjusted to include their fee in the price. Let’s say you buy 100 of bitcoin and they charge you a fee of 3.84- your bank will show a charge of 100 (96.16 + 3.84), not 103.84 (100 + 3.84).  The order is placed not on the price you first saw (since that is always in flux while you are filling in the order form), but a bit higher or lower to accommodate that fee adjusted price. Maybe? Just guessing here.

Great Job! What about an option to let you put in a desired target? Let's say i wanted to know when i would reach a certain percentage or profit amount - it would tell me what the price would have to go up to to make that happen.

Taxable event. That 1000 is divided by 10  for the initial cost of each coin, then the 2000 is divided by 5 for the sale price of each coin.

That was from my invoice, yes. I didn’t take a screenshot of the going chart price at the time, but once the purchase process was started it was always a constant quoted rate (a bit higher than the charts)

You do, but be careful. Each of those sales is a taxable event- even if you leave it on coinbase.

Why disappointed? You both want the same thing. The dollar is just a scale people (currently) use to measure the bitcoin’s buying power, and we all want that to go up. The more it goes up, the more it can buy. For now, though, for most people, you have to “cash out” before you can wield that buying power. In the future that step might not be necessary anymore.

I thought it was other people buying the coins, not coinbase? Somebody panic sells at 12000, another person scoops that up, and coinbase takes a cut for processing. There is no way for coinbase to ‘run out of money’ since every sale is matched with a buyer.
