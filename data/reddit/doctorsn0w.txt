Am I the only one who misread the title and thought that they tested their infrastructure against a lightning strike?

Op speaks the truth. Especially if you get your Bitcoin/altcoin from mining.

Agreed. Bitcoin should not incur income taxes until the  they are sold/traded for traditional currency. The beauty of cryptocurrency is that its decentralized and controlled by exclusively the users. The government doesn't own it; they didn't make it. Its not theirs to tax.

well i use 2Fa for everything :D

Because the tax is on the traditional currency, not on the goods. If you're buying shoes, you don't give the gov't a portion of your shoe.
