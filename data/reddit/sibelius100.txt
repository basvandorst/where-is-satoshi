Geez, no reason to be a fucking dickhead...of course, a daily volume 300 is of no significance on a global scale but it is ten times higher than the previous weeks.  So a ten-fold increase in BAKKT trading volume, coupled by a 10% drop in Bitcoin price....so you think that's just a coincidence?

AFAIK OP has another address with the same (forgotten) password to unlock the private key.  The address ending with  YfD9ZK is just for the proof of concept, e.g once you crack the PW you can prove to the OP that you're in possession of the correct PW by moving the 0.001 BTC to another address.

Thanks, appreciate your input.

That's true, I also didn't get any responses to my follow up questions.

Umm...that's not the address??

I am currently going through the following combinations
A = A-Z  
a = a-z
With this format there are 456'989 possible combinations.  So far I've checked half of that.  Unfortunately no GPU implementation and I can do about 2 PW/s per core.
Which variants have you checked already if I may ask?

Ok, sounds interesting.  I am just using some underutilized PCs in my spare time, which is rather limited.  Didn't have the chance to experiment with GPUs yet, although I would have a GeForce 1080 TI laying around.  If the current format does not yield any results I will try to increase the amount of letters.
Good luck with your brute forcing efforts!

Thank you!  If I find some spare time I'll give it a go with hashcat.  I guess a lot of luck is involved with finding this particular needle in the universe :-)
