Who knows when they will be considered a bad guy though?   Seems the government and the people disagree/have different ideas on who or what constitutes a 'bad guy'.

In my experience,  sentry safes are absolute garbage.   If you are making safes that can easily and consistently be broke into,  I am not going to feel very confident in your fire proof rating.   Buying a sentry safe versus a real safe is kind of like the difference between using Dewalt versus Black and Decker.   While the Black and Decker resembles an actual tool,  when you start using it you quickly figure out the difference between looking like a tool and actually being a useful tool.    It's like buying a real IPhone versus buying a knock off.   Winchester Rifle versus Red Ryder BB gun.   Do not buy Sentry if you are actually looking to protect something of value.

I have been thinking of venturing into bitcoin, and I must admit this thread is making me feel like I may need to reconsider.   From what I have read contrasted against my tech experience,  seems like I will need to invest hella time learning about encryption and security practices.   Which isn't a big deal for the advantages it can provide,  but is a big deal when I consider the amount of free time I have available for said learning.

It was a team effort...   I think it is very unfair this guy is getting credited for a feat that likely took hundreds of very skilled people to accomplish.

I think they released early for the publicity to be gained from releasing at the same time Silk Road2 and other dark Web sites got busted.

My point exactly.  Thank you.

This is only effective in an enclosed space.   If the thief has room to use a crowbar on the safe,  it will be easy enough for him to rip it out of the floor.

Small safes are fine when used correctly.   Correctly in this case meaning securely screwed into your homes woodwork frame, preferably in an enclosed space.

Those soccer moms can be pretty fierce when they are riled up.

The fed has a vested interest.  So does every government that owns their own currency.
