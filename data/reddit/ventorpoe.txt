Your ignorance is so painful. 


Bitcoin is backed by encryption, and a shared ledger across the internet.
I stopped reading here. He is talking about valuation. There is nothing holding bitcoin's value. He even says why our current currency holds value in the video. 
You are a fucking idiot. Plain and simple.

Hey, it's not my money which is going to fly out the window 1 day. Its yours. :D

What are you talking about? What corruption? 
This man has a PhD in economics and was a professor at some of the best universities in the world. Don't tell me he doesn't understand. He understands economics better than you ever will. 
The fact that you think he doesn't understand and that you know better is absolutely hilarious to me.

The people in this subreddit are absolutely delusional. It's hilarious. 
"This guy doesn't believe in Bitcoin, he is the enemy" Pretty much the sentiment I get from all the community college heroes in this subreddit.

Magic Internet Money is way too accurate. 
I feel bad for the schmucks who invest too much into this. As this valuation is solely based on popular opinion. All it takes is one influential person to trash talk it and it's out the window.

This guy is the reason I laugh at most Bitcoin 'investors'. Unless you can provide some DD, don't fucking make sweeping statements, you just look like an idiot to people that actually know what they are talking about.

What the fuck is wrong with you? 
@_date: 2015-04-03 13:22:03
Why would I do that?
@_date: 2015-11-17 09:20:43
You guys seem really salty.

That's a nice edit but you still don't demonstrate any knowledge of how politics in America works.

What the fuck??
@_date: 2016-05-08 09:03:51
What you said make no sense at all. 
Public servants are 100% accountable for their actions because they can be replaced by a majority vote. 
@_date: 2016-05-08 10:00:34
So what you are saying is, you want other people to do the heavy lifting? I am not toxic or angry, I am just aware of what it takes to see change. Awareness does absolutely nothing if no one is actually acting on it. 
"Change requires more than just righteous anger"
Please listen, Obama talks about this EXACT issue.

This 7 figure salary is worth every comment. ;)
@_date: 2016-05-08 08:33:31
You don't make any sense. 
@_date: 2016-05-08 09:45:43
So what is the alternative? Scream/Kick/Shout until someone else does something? Your logic is fucking pathetic.
I think that all you like to do is complain on the internet. You don't care about fixing anything, it just makes you feel good to complain. 
@_date: 2016-05-08 08:23:31
Then vote those politicians out. If they are as crazy as you think they are.

Sorry that you can't do illegal shit online anymore.
