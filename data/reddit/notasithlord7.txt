Maybe. Adoption can come from gradual growth in utility and use cases as well though. I personally think this will probably occur and be responsible for growth for awhile before the fiat crises many here seem to be banking on. 
Which is good, because if that fiat crises happens next week Bitcoin won't be ready.

Sure. But given the fact we can't know what "optimal" is i'd rather err on the side of caution. Bitcoin's primary use cases right now are not very fee sensitive after all.

Exactly, the moderator function and multisig wallets can make it work. Can see a big competitive ecosystem forming there. People can post or choose listings independently and pick their level of insurance and service in a moderator. The functionality largely exists, the biggest challenge is just making it all seamless and user friendly. 
@_date: 2016-08-31 23:01:19
An on chain transaction fee is pretty tiny, and I count only one fee needed for the money changer, who also has to cover a conversion fee since he's got a bunch of Bitcoin now. 
I can realistically see that being competitive price wise and much less of a hassle than doing two different wire transfers just to get it into Mexico. 
And if there's any actual volume via this method you'd think Mexican businesses would also start accepting it too.
Pretty sure u can receive and send bitcoin with SMS already.

Lightning isn't an alt coin. It's a method of delaying and aggregating on chain transactions. No amount of framing changes the technical facts.
@_date: 2016-08-30 13:54:29
How is it "stealing" anything? These networks are literally only and just about aggregating and delaying on chain transactions in a totally trustless way. 
Any objective person can see if that works what a tremendous accomplishment for both paid user fees and scaling that would be. You literally sound like a crazy old man afraid of lawnmowers taking away good old grass cutting jobs.

Either Zane is incompetent since he basically said or at the very least heavily implied this wouldn't be the case in his audio interview, or there's worse stuff going on. 
I did not lose money in this absurdly run exchange, but here's my unsolicited .02 for those who did. You do not need to take this into the courts and liquidate the exchange. As stated this guarantees you won't see any of your money for years and much will probably be eaten up by various fees and expenses. It's much better to work with Bitfinex *if* they are willing to work in an acceptably transparent way. 
However you *cannot* allow these people to dictate the terms, and then trust them to be honest and ethical about it. That's patently absurd. Regardless of what they think an independent third party needs to be brought in to verify the books and make sure that 1. both the 36% number is accurate, and 2. that Bitfinex doesn't make a dime of profit in the future until all its debt is paid off. This is common sense.
 If they do not do take these steps there is almost a guarantee of *fraud* going on at *some* level. Maybe the hack was an inside job, maybe it wasn't but Bitfinex assets were stolen and now they're using their own customers to cover themselves. Who the hell knows what's going on if there isn't a reputable third party involved with full access? 
Bitfinex owes millions to its customers. It is effectively your slave now until it repays everyone in full as a *minimum*. If it is unwilling to be as transparent as possible under these circumstances and its (former) customers don't demand it, fraud is being given a green light. You are sending a signal that an inside job can be pulled by an exchange (whether it happened here or not) and that people will accept it if you make vague promises of paying them back while covering up the trail in a cloak of secrecy. At that point authorities should be brought in since the exchange is unwilling to take the necessary and proper measures on its own to *prove* it is doing everything in its power to right the situation they are solely at fault for. 
Bitfinex has a *chance* to be a remarkable case study of an exchange self correcting for survival if it does all the right things from here on out. Just a chance. If it keeps phucking up and stalling for time however there's 0 chance it will maintain business, those BFX tokens will be worthless, and its former customer base will probably be getting robbed blind any number of ways. Such criminal behavior cannot be tolerated. It's in *EVERYONE'S* best interest to avoid the worst case scenario, but if Bitfinex doesn't offer any other viable choice it should be done. Viable, independent, third party auditing and investigation is a necessary perquisite. Every hour this is delayed the likelihood of fraud and unethical behavior going on mounts.

Your reply makes no sense. I did not admit that larger blocks would lead to more users, I called it preposterous. I even dedicated an article to the topic here:
What my post said is even if we *assume* users would flock to Bitcoin because the average price of a transaction is .03 instead of .07, the effects on full nodes must be negative. 


Has nothing to do with if they actually will. You're entire plan for scaling and maintaining decentralization is based on hoping for more altruism since there's no need to deal with the hassle of running a full node to own or send coins. 
So to recap your scaling plan is based on two terrible assumptions. 
1. The blocksize limit is the limiting factor in growth 
2. Despite all historical trends more people will start running full nodes
If you have a problem with the "authoritarian" and "anti-free market" Core plan please fork and stop babbling. Since no blocksize cap is so amazing it'll magically lead to a huge influx of users you should have no problem overtaking the Core chain.
@_date: 2016-08-16 14:58:01
As a "small blocker" I agree with most of your points. I think an 8GB limit is a bit big and a flexible cap however are too much and it comes down to nodes. 
If nodes were financially incentivized then I'd agree the block limit should be self set by miners. But they're not. Miners have an incentive to stuff as many transactions as they can handle into a block. Their revenue allows them to reinvest in their hardware and continue to make improvements. 
This is not the case for non-mining full nodes. The problem here is that Bitcoin *is not* an emergent phenomenon. Despite its distributed nature its design is very much the product of man. It has faults. It is not perfectly balanced as emergent orders are (although it's close). 
Full nodes are a tragedy of the commons. There is a cost to putting more transactions into a block and they are disproportionately placed on full nodes who recurve no return for the extra work and resources. If you allow block sizes to be larger in any way it follows that the increased costs will drive more nodes out of the network. This is what I meant by not being able to rely in on chain scaling else Bitcoin becomes "B2B". With only large, easily regulated servers and data centers hosting nodes if the network is still alive at all. 
To me this is a pressing long term concern that outweighs the minor hit to short term growth that the cap currently places. Being small is our greatest weakness, but right now we don't even know if we can get "big" and even work optimally. This to me pisses people off who were sold on the hype and hoping to make it rich off major adoption in a few years. I see a lot of big blockers who fit this bill and people who leave for an even bigger pump with ethereum. 
Features like compact blocks and these different signatures will marginally help reduce the costs on nodes, but none are the silver bullet. If there is an Achilles heel to Bitcoin it seems to me to be nodes. As long as we can't finance them well be walking a tight rope of security and adoption. Personally I think the entire point of the LN is to scale while sidestepping these problems. Core may be very convinced with these facts in mind the only sustainable way forward is a settlement network with *very* gradual increases in on chain scaling.
I have yet to find a reason to disagree with this outlook short of figuring out how to incentivize full nodes.
@_date: 2016-08-25 14:27:59
None of that matters if it creates larger problems down the road, which is what Core is trying to avoid.

As for this site it is a tor hidden site, but unlike silk road it is invite only precisely because its even worse. The entire point of it is to show what a monster Ray truly is. The DPR username was an easter egg to what clearly inspired the plot line, but in no way does it misrepresent what silk road was to the general audience. The fact is Bitcoin is used almost exclusively in such markets and people already know this.

That's ridiculous, holders have all the power because they and they alone determine market value. If the chain split to accommodate more coins and reduce everyone's wealth people will just stay on the original chain. Since that's where the value is gonna be then miners will keep mining that regardless of the initial share of hash power. And that's if it even gets that far. 
Utterly ridiculous.

Money and open protocols both tend to heavily consolidate because of network effects. They are not like tv channels.
That's the "maximalism" part. The Bitcoin part is just that that money/protocol is most likely to be Bitcoin. That doesn't mean there isn't some kind of value in other coins as test beds and niche uses in the short to medium term. But in the long term usage and market cap will consolidate heavily into the best protocol.

That's what I'm wrapping my head around. If you're a high quality uploader then great, if the idea is to keep track of the downloads and make people pay micro-fees for them. But why would people not stick to torrents that have always been free?  
The only way I can see it happening is if tons of great uploaded start using that exclusively, and there's no easy way to circumvent the micro transaction. Then maybe it would work.
@_date: 2016-08-29 18:17:02


That's preposterous. Nodes are already on a decline with a population of users that's pretty technically savy and ideologically invested and at the current block limit. So when you raise the block limit, *assuming* more capacity automatically means more users, you think all these mainstream people are gonna start downloading and running an even more bloated blockchain?
Tell you what. Figure out how to financially incentivize full nodes to keep pace with mining pool demand for bigger blocks and then I'll agree a flexible cap can work. Until then just go ahead and fork to Unlimited. That's the only real competition that's possible here.

Oh no I agree. "Independent party" can be a lot of things, but there *must* be one. Best case scenario is an investigation and acquisition. If they have the money to burn to pay off some debt immediately, + restart the exchange with a full security audit and insurance they could restore confidence and have the best bet at getting everyone's money back. But at minimum you need a full independent audit and transparency here on out. BFX is basically a security, and you can't know how much a security is worth unless the company actually acts like a public company. 
Just no sane way the same incompetent managers that set up that wallet system should be allowed to do anything without total transparency at a *minimum*.
@_date: 2016-08-11 01:58:57
Which they can reduce by buying back that debt at dimes on the dollar. We know they have funds as they made it abundantly clear only customer wallets were effected, and the lack of transparency means who knows what they're doing with their own money.

They would need to be high quality, malware free, 0 ads etc. Which paying a small fee would incentivize. But that's still no guarantee. This would require *something* on the downloaded side in terms of signing up for an account or downloading something which is extra work. It will still be far easier to go to any other other site and click a magnet link. 
Color me skeptical. 
@_date: 2016-08-13 21:40:26
A decentralized blockchain is of course necessary, and the more distributed the better. I'm very much a maximalist in that I see one main blockchain dominating all use cases. 
As far as what poses a threat to Bitcoin being that blockchain, I'm not compelled by anything that exists right now. I see things like Ethereum as a nice playground who's lessons and useful features will eventually be incorporated into Bitcoin. A big innovation that could challenge it (if it couldn't be quickly copied) is a coin that has figured out how to reward full nodes. You do that and you solve a lot of subset scaling problems.
@_date: 2016-08-19 03:36:05
@_date: 2016-08-14 06:24:47
None of that matters. Ultimately one chain can optimally support every possible use case using pegged side chains. It's just the most optimal setup. Instead of using many separate tokens trying to gain traction they all share each others underlying liquidity and network effect.
If it can be copied to a side chain it will, and it will be better simply because it's not in isolation. What you are suggesting is akin to someone saying you need to use your own incompatible HTTP protocol to build your own web app. Even if the app is amazing no one is going to bother wanting to get to it and make it work when it can just be easily connected to the web with HTTP instead. 
Every merchant, service, and software will already be supporting the dominant blockchain token, just like every web browser already supports the same universal protocols. That blockchain will probably be Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-08-22 03:03:05
The fiat that have more volatility to BTC are few and far inbetween. Venezuela, Argentina etc are candidates. I do agree that does present adoption advantages should other things like infrastructure be in place. 
But for the vast majority of the developed world where the infrastructure is easily put in place, no one has to worry about day to day currency flux. Bitcoin market cap and volume is a drop in a bucket compared to most national currencies. So my original point is I don't see how people can use Bitcoin without knowing its Bitcoin. If you just show them fiat equivalents it'll fluctuate and it's crazy to think consumers wouldn't notice or care. 
I think Bitcoin has specific advantages and use cases that will lead the way in adoption. But people will be using it for those use cases will deffinetly know its Bitcoin. Theres just no way to integrate or disguise it that gets around the volatility. The only answer to that is market cap.
@_date: 2016-08-05 15:06:02
It may be significant as an investment but I don't see how more devs wouldn't help greatly in the long run, and have seen several core contributors mention that manpower/mindshare is an ongoing problem.

Seems like such systems would have to be (and are) facilitated by a central provider, who manage the end balance of credits and IOUs. If it's encoded in the blockchain and power is bought in real time using bitcoin then you can cut out the middle man and have a truly modular power network seems to me.

While transaction fees do need to be reduced, I think the  panic is unwarranted. As is the claim that if Bitcoin can't be used for coffee purchases, it will immediately be replaced by something else. That whole line of thinking seems dangerously flawed. 
The only way that would happen, is if all the new adopters of Bitcoin and crypto were actually trying to use it to buy coffee. The truth is I believe the people using crypto for small and frequent transfers of that type are simply a vocal minority. Buying coffee is not the killer app, even if it were magically free to do. Price volatility and confirmation times makes it absurd to think small retail transactions will be the main use case driving growth. This is an old idea a lot of Bitcoiners seem to be having trouble letting go of. 
Bitcoin can and will be money with solutions like LN in the long term which get at the root of the problem in scalable way. It's absolutely essential to its long term success. But let's not pretend there's a wave of people rushing into crypto so that they can buy mocha frappacinos and will switch to even smaller and more volatile coins to facilitate that if Bitcoin can't do so today. That's patently absurd. 
Before we freak out over a big brand name dropping Bitcoin payments let's first ask ourselves a couple of things. How much was microsoft ever really receiving in terms of bitcoin payments, even when fees were cheap?  And do we really think them doing so an immediately converting to fiat was ever really going to drive adoption? We're people really throwing their money into Bitcoin and learning a whole new system and technology to do something with it they could already much more easily and reliably do with traditional payment methods? 
Let's dial back on the hysteria.

I don't even think that's a good assumption, and many people are neglecting that true potential of a mesh network of payment channels. Your coffee shop may never have need to pay you, but another customer of the coffee shop may need to and it can be routed through the coffee shop for a small fee.
Could also be someone who has a channel open with a restaurant that has a channel open with a coffee bean supplier that has a channel open with your coffee shop that needs to pay you. Endless spontaneous possibilities.

"People are flocking to invest, not use."
Is that really a problem then? It sounds like you're saying "no one goes there anymore, it's too crowded". 
"I can't replace the piece of plastic in my wallet with bitcoin unless the transaction costs are brought down."
Then perhaps the market disagrees with you on what the best current use of this technology is *today*. Personally I don't think anyone will massively want to adopt any crypto to replace their credit card or fiat in general until it grows enough in market cap that volatility begins to level off. Until that point is reached most people just can't afford to take that kind of risk with their day to day money, so whether it's cheap enough to buy a coffee with is a rather mute point.

Um that's totally false, there's several implementations. Including well supported and used ones like Bcoin. Which makes the BCasher naming of the real Bitcoin being "Bitcoin Core" all the more dishonest.

Which is exactly why segwit was the scaling compromise which was accepted. You can make blocks bigger, but it has to be done with this new transaction format that lessons the load on nodes and their biggest bottleneck atm, memory.

@_date: 2017-12-01 18:06:07
This isn't accurate. There are other implementations you can contribute to, and you can make your own that is still consensus compatible. 
If you want to make changes to the consensus rules however, then you have to convince all the economic nodes out there to run your software. Having widespread developer support obviously helps in that regard, and the majority of those contribute to Core for a reason. They have rightfully earned influence but don't have anything approximating the traditional notions of power, which is an important distinction. Consumers ultimately decide what Bitcoin is and isn't. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 16:26:45

The traditional notions of power center around a monopoly of violence and the threat of force. Everything you're talking about is just private citizens using their own private resources to voice their own suggestions and opinions. Note, I am not saying that these specific acts are correct or the best approach or anything. Simply that what amounts to marketing concerns in no way approximates notions of powers. 
You can totally disagree with a delisting of a site etc. but it's disingenuous to suggest that's somehow akin to "economic sanctions" leveraged by fiat and backed by force. The market can freely route around one if it's in the wrong, but not the other. You're literally only talking about marketing. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:53:30
If you're technical, then read the white paper. 
All payment channels do at a high level is take normal bitcoin transactions, except instead of broadcasting each and every one for inclusion into the blockchain, postponing that action so the settlement difference between counterparties is the only thing that is published. So you can potentially just pay the fee of one or two transactions (opening and closing a channel) for a huge amount of transactions within that channel. LN just adds routing to that. 
It's like a caching layer for Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 23:15:14
The channel is a multisginature wallet that the two counterparties have keys for. No balance changes can be done without both their approval. It can't be spent in the payment channel unless it is in that address. That much is perfectly secure.

A common shtick I keep seeing: "Yeah but it doesn't have a ton of real usage. The price is being artificially pushed up by hoarding". 
Feel free to repeat: "Hoarding", aka saving, is a legitimate use case. Given all the hair cuts going on in places like Venezuela and India, people are desperate for an alternative that's more useful than burying gold in the backyard. This trend can only accelerate given the global state of fiat monetary systems. This isn't even a hypothetical anymore. It's real, and it's costing lives.

That doesn't make sense. Miners nowadays have absolutely massive capital investments in equipment that can't do anything else except mine Bitcoin. They have every incentive to see the network grow and survive, and every incentive to do what they can to make the currency they are directly compensated with more valuable. 
@_date: 2017-01-03 16:05:38
Of course. But with extremely discounted old mining equipment (since it literally can't be used for anything else), the profitability threshold looks much better.

@_date: 2016-11-25 17:22:45
I feel like Blockstream should get into this business. Think about it. 
Selling independent and self running full nodes is a great next gen financial privacy solution. Get trustless access to the Bitcoin network, and have tools like coin join natively wired in with every transaction. Setup would also be far easier and safer than configuring all your own stuff on a PC.  I can see a growing number of people who would find such a product attractive. 
It's also a perfect synergy since it would encourage more full nodes to be operated, and Blockstream is obviously heavily invested in the future of the Bitcoin network. I can't think of a better initial consumer product. 
@_date: 2017-01-06 05:58:08
I think the price posts are hilarious. Even in Bitcoin we don't get this level of wild daily swings that often. Enjoy the fun while we're here. 
Would you prefer to go back to circular arguments about block size and the rate of Segwit adoption? 
@_date: 2016-12-10 06:36:25
What's wrong with demand spikes pushing up the price? Deflation is a natural process that takes place in a healthy economy. It makes no sense to actively want, or need, to combat it. As a society gets wealthier there are more goods and services available relative to the amount of money in circulation. 
That just means your money buys more than it used to, which makes sense when your society is growing richer. 
So Telling people that instead you actually need to sap away the increased value represented by your money through inflation (and channeled to special interests) to keep the economy healthy, or to have a "real" currency, is ludicrous.
@_date: 2016-11-30 05:23:36
If they don't they will. The best way for individuals trying to do this would be to buy them direct from miners, or better yet mine themselves. Black markets for this sorta thing will also continue to evolve. 
@_date: 2016-11-15 00:13:55
I'm also curious to the answer. I thought the entire point of a soft fork was to maintain backward compatibility so that, among other things, it could be enacted with less total support without splitting the chain. 95% just seems excessive and unreasonable with my limited understanding. 
@_date: 2016-12-01 06:22:51
Bitcoin being difficult to change is a feature not a bug. 
@_date: 2016-11-23 21:52:40
Bitcoin on its own simply doesn't scale. Conceptually, requiring every node to store every single standalone transaction is just crazy. Segwit is required to make powerful enhancements to on chain transactions possible, like the massive aggregation that LN makes possible. 
@_date: 2016-11-06 21:32:20
Empirically measuring decentralization trade-offs is all but impossible. We can only identify the different incentives that can push it in one direction or another. Even if we could measure it, we don't even know how much of it is needed for continued network security and success. Given these facts the only thing that makes sense is to err on the side of too much decentralization, unless there is a very convincing case that doing so is actively hurting adoption. I don't see this as the case right now at all and talk about it more [here](
They might not kill Bitcoin outright, but you can't turn back changes like larger blocks that hurt decentralization. You *can* spend more time developing scaling solutions that don't make that trade-off at all. It should be clear that larger blocks are the last resort scaling solution, and there should be a huge burden of proof on its advocates to prove why it's urgently needed. 
@_date: 2016-11-13 00:21:01
I paid 5 cents for an international $4k transaction which took less than 20 minutes to be confirmed. "Blocks are full" is inaccurate and alarmist.

It's entertaining when you're a hodler. Otherwise we're back to arguing about blocksize or complaining about Segwit activation in circles. 
@_date: 2016-11-26 22:20:23
I'd be surprised if actual dedicated "big blockers" control much more than 5% of the hash rate. Once it gets close to that point then the onus is on them for delaying a bump in on chain scaling, and awesome malleability fix that makes massively innovative use of blockchain space possible. 
The only ever semi-valid debate was whether we needed to risk a capacity increase faster than Seg Wit could be made ready. Well now it's ready, so what's the reasoning now? BU or any alternative BIP to increase the limit will surley take much longer to implement now. Do we actually need a capacity increase asap, or are we politically attached to a certain way to go about it now (that isn't received well by the vast majority of seasoned developers)?
Stragglers will and should cave to the pressure. If you want big blocks this desperately and are so sure of its superiority, try and split off or make your own coin. Bitcoin should die and all its users will rush to your implementation, right????
@_date: 2016-11-24 15:08:58
You're making a really bad assumption here, namely that everyone's use case demand they need to get into the next block. That is absolutely not true. Such instant confirmation is most common with run of the mill retail transactions which is simply not a dominant use case and won't be for a long time. When it comes to transferring sums of money internationally, using dark net etc, taking a few blocks is still nothing compared to conventional alternatives. And the liquidity and infrastructure of Bitcoin still make it much more attractive than random Alts in those settings.
Aka, the sky is not falling.
@_date: 2016-11-30 05:18:12
That's not how this works. 
@_date: 2016-11-30 04:57:32
Not really. All or even most miners don't have to be in cahoots for this to be the case. In that hypothetical situation, the malicious groups might just be unable to convince the miners but still exist. 
Short of a leak, it would probably be impossible to prove this in any way even if it were happening. One of the reasons that developing Bitcoin improvements is not enough. The ideas behind them need to be communicated effectively.

I'm not sure how valid the concerns are over the reward halving. Seems like a very unlikely scenario that so many miners go under at once when we've seen that the market adjusts to the halving well before it actually occurs, which is logical.

If you're looking for an easier way to make payments then you're looking in the wrong place, unless those payments are international or other conventional methods are unavailable. In which case the fee is well worth the value of being able to make the transaction. 
@_date: 2016-12-03 17:57:29
But the number of node targets isn't that high either which is the point, especially when plenty of them are poorly run and secured. 
@_date: 2016-11-25 16:56:40
All the sky is falling rhetoric also makes the terribly bad assumption that all transactions *need* to be in the next block. This is outrageously false for Bitcoin's valuable use cases today. 
Example: I was recently transferred a large sum of coins from an individual on the other side of the globe. Using traditional technology, receiving the funds would take several days and a hefty fee. In other words it didn't matter if it cleared in 10 minutes, or a couple hours, it is still a massive improvement and value add. We specified the minimum fee and I believe I got the first confirmation in under 30 minutes and for a trivial amount. 
Bitcoin's economic acitivity right now, besides speculation, come from offering utility to the underserved that can't be gained anywhere else. These type of international transfers can't be reliably performed by anything else. Neither can purchases off the bustling dark net. These types of transactions are Bitcoin's bread and butter, and they're not even close to being that ridiculously time sensitive. 
That's because it's impossible to do these things with traditional middle man technology, and alt coins are even more volatile and uncertain. Bitcoin has the capability, infrastructure, and liquidity.
@_date: 2016-11-24 15:12:37

@_date: 2016-11-02 17:51:30

"The more miners that use it, the larger this incentive becomes."
That's not true. Mining is a zero sum game. If everyone is using ASICBOOST it's the same as if no one is. That being said, it's an obviously cleaner and simpler approach to introduce a patch that renders it obsolete than negotiating with a patent holder who has no incentive to give away their competitive advantage. 
@_date: 2017-04-03 14:31:51
Bitcoin was designed to have a fee market since day 1, and the limit was added when previously unforeseen issues were identified (and still haven't been solved). Emergent consensus amongst miners is novel and a total gamble to say the least. 
@_date: 2017-04-10 11:59:39

I think we will see an "Ecoin" equivalent for similar reasons. However it'll be all for nothing if they don't retain control over money creation, which won't be sustainable. On an equal playing field consumers will choose a more stable and non political currency rather than one that's consistently devalued.

I don't think anyone knows how profitable it'll be yet, but probably not that much. Literally anybody with any amount of Bitcoin can start an LN node and offer instant competition. People with more liquidity will have an advantage sure, but in a market as close to perfect competition as the LN their margins will not be huge.
@_date: 2016-09-16 15:52:43
Sure, the Chinese gov't could cause problems if it really went all in on a well thought and executed plan to do so. 
But that's fundamentally different than saying most Bitcoin transactions "run through" China, and implying it has some kind of innate control over it. That's simply not true.
@_date: 2016-09-22 02:23:20
I really don't get the fearful zero sum mentality around this space. The only thing a fork will do is allow us to figure out which implementation is actually best at achieving our goals faster. I like Core's plan, but me and Core can both be wrong. Only way to know for sure is to compete against something else. I feel like everyone should be open to this. Dealing with the PR of a split chain is a minor drawback compared to the advantages that competition brings.

"A basic, functioning version of the Lightning network" ready upon SW activation, if it even happens that quickly, is just the first of many steps to having the LN actually enhance scalability in a meaningful way. 
There is a massive gap between a buggy, command line, opt in feature and complete integration with Bitcoin wallets and other infrastructure. The later is what I'm referring to in my speculative time line. It's conservative, but I'll be more than happy to be proven wrong.

Your blatant assumption that the age of this Reddit account has any direct connection to how long I've been studying Bitcoin is laughable. The world is a bit bigger than r/Bitcoin. Neither are you in any position to determine who is and isn't qualified to speak on these subjects. 
As for the LN I hope you're right. I hope it kicks in the moment SW is released and quickly starts growing and use, boom problem solved. I'm a huge proponent of these solutions and that would obviously be great. 
But color me very skeptical. Everything I have read has heavily suggested there's dozens of researches solving many remaining problems in order to make the LN a reality, and it isn't some production ready code just sitting around for SW to kick in. Or does the team at Bitfury and various others making LN their priority just have nothing better to do but look busy? 
On top of that im very conservative on the speed at which consumer facing software actually incorporates LN for easy use. Again I don't care if the LN even works fully if the only way to get to it is going to be command line. Consumers need easy and intuitive access before we start seeing any meaningful traction. 
That being said I think your claim that the LN (as opposed to just basic payment channels) would even be that far along by the time of SW activation is beyond optimistic. 
Have fun with your big man Reddit account.

Is Bitcoin used for live cam tipping type stuff at all? I feel like this could be an interesting use case. Not sure how they currently work but I can see the appeal of instantly transferred tips, and the ability to use smart contracts that could do things like require a recieving address to pool X amount of Bitcoin from viewers before the video hosts remove some clothing or whatever. If it isn't met then it just gets refunded back. Viewers also benefit from not linking card statements directly to adult entertainment sites.

Your comment is interesting and a lot more nuanced than most people probably think socialist ideas are. I still take issue with your fundamental opposition to currency though, which is ultimately just a useful tool employed by individuals. 


This implies that private property shouldn't exist, and also that currency is somehow responsible for its creation. But you have it backwards. Private property is in itself a necessary and useful tool because the physical world we live in is plagued by scarcity. If everything is in the commons who gets to decide how factory A is used and run? Who gets to decide how these barrels of water are used and this brick of gold? No doubt there will be plenty of different people, including workers, who will disagree as to its use. Which means there is a clear need to determine control of property. 
In the state socialist system this has meant giving up all property to the State, which manages it with its own arbitrary and corrupt hierarchy. See Venezuela, Cuba, North Korea, etc. to see how that works out. 
The only other solution is to create clear object standards for individual ownership which are protected against the multitudes, which basically becomes the principles of private property. I see no alternatives here, because being nice and just sharing isn't going to work. 
Once that's established its in everyone's best interest to work together with other humans, first on a partnership type level (let's work this farm together) then through trade (we're good at farming and neighbor is good at making tools, let's exchange). 
The well known problem of course is that the party whose product you want may not want the product you produce, so you have to play a very time expensive game of multiple trades to get around this. Money originally evolved as a commonly valued good with certain properties that allowed for much easier trade. The farmer can simply exchange excess produce for a gold or some silver coins and trade that to his neighbor for the tools he would like. 
Nothing about these naturally emergent social behaviors are oppressive. They were naturally emergent precisely because they were beneficial to all parties involved. Currency only became per erred when it was co-opted by the state to enhance political power and leverage, something Bitcoin seeks to set back by putting it once more outside of their control.
I also don't see how you would achieve your currency-less utopia. Bitcoin is an open source protocol that for the sake of argument can't be destroyed. That means so long as people mutually benefit they can use it to facilitate trade. The only way to even theoretically stop that is to engage in violence against those who do, and to call that violence justified is to become the embodiment of the State.

It's only a threat if you believe it's a superior implementation, at which point you might as well just switch over. There are no "threats" to open source software besides the State trying to muddy the waters.

Haha there's a laugh. No it doesn't. Governments love their monopoly on fiat because it means they can deficit spend. They hire tons of economists to figure out how to best funnel the new money, and give the appearance it's for the benefit of the public or something. Monetary policy is a farce. 
The economy functions purely by decentralized price signaling. People can be swayed by rumors and sentiment but ultimately price signals are the hard reality that keep things in check. When you rampantly manipulate the money supply however, you distort price signals and the whole economy is running blind. 
The pre-Fed panics weren't as minor as they were because the economy was less global. China was the first to issue fiat money hundreds of years prior and wrecked their whole economy many separate times over thanks to their monetary policy. The US panics were small and local because in the long run price signals were reliable and forced corrections sooner rather than later.
@_date: 2016-09-15 07:38:40


Huh? Like central planning prevented the massive housing boom and bust cycle? 
Massive business cycles are only possible when there is rampant expansion of the money supply, something only a central authority can do with fiat currency. Prior to the Federal Reserve there were several financial "panics" but they were all tiny, quick, and more localized in comparison to the crises we've had since. It's the decision of the central planners to keep the illusionary party going alone that makes these phenomena worse by an order of magnitude.

Perhaps someone can more clearly list the details if I'm wrong, as my memory isn't perfect. But I do recall hearing from the very start of the HK agreement that the devs present made it clear they did not represent anyone but themselves. They certainly didn't pretend to represent consensus. HK was a plan to hear out the miners and help technically introduce their proposals, without any promises that they would gain consensus. 
How is that remotely similar to 2X's coalition of company execs, the vast majority of who's companies are funded by one company, unilaterally deciding a hard fork?

The concept of "consensus" is commonly referred to as a much wider net than simply miners. So it would have been more clear if you prefaced it as "miner consensus", which as pointed out, means very little on its own.

@_date: 2017-10-26 23:02:00
Impossible to say. What is "optimal" from a security perspective is that everyone who wants to run a full node should be able to. However, you wont find anybody I believe who thinks that is practical. Still, the closer we are to that the better. The only way to get closer to that is for the block size to remain the same while hardware and bandwidth continue to improve. So increasing the block size should thus be a last resort when all other scaling options are exhausted.
As it is segwit on its own is already a compromise. That's because it allows for larger blocks (up to 4MB worse case) but only if those extra included transactions are in the segwit format, which saves nodes memory.  
@_date: 2017-10-09 17:12:37
Segwit transaction adoption will take years but 95% of the ecosystem will execute a hardfork at an exact time, simultaneously, on command. 
@_date: 2017-10-03 04:04:44
This +100. The fact that consensus is so hard to measure, coupled with stability and security being so important, puts the burden of proof on the ones hard forking to prove that such a fork is not only desired but will actually execute properly with a vast majority of the ecosystem. The very fact that there is so much public kicking and screaming over 2X, including from some very high profile individuals, is evidence enough that this is not the case and 2X is in fact dangerous. 
Because 2X has been presented by its supporters as the de facto "update" to Bitcoin, this makes the whole thing even more disingenuous. Most users don't care about 2X one way or the other, but what they do care about is that their money feels safe and stable. Many may no longer feel that this is the case if 2X is irresponsibly launched by a handful of companies with nowhere near super majority of miners *and* nodes, and splits the ecosystem.

Straw-man. Of course what Satoshi said matters, but when considering his statements you have to take into account new information and developments since then. No one has ever said we should just totally disregard Satoshi or that everything he/she/they've said is irrelevant. You just totally made that up. 


This is FUD. It was proposed to update the WP there to reflect developments and changes since then that should probably be included for those looking to get a high level understanding of today's actual Bitcoin. The original WP still exists and I'm sure has been hashed into the blockchain numerous times by now so it's not like history is being rewritten. 
The only thing I and many others take issue with is holding the writings of Satoshi as dogmatic gospel, which you aptly demonstrate here why it's a problem.

Lightning Network will also do awesome things for scaling without putting more pressure on the network. 
On top of those two initiatives they also obviously fund several core developers. I hardly think that can all be classified as a "passing interest".

I tackle this specific argument below: 
@_date: 2016-07-31 22:00:24
Yeah Ethereum has some disadvantages with everything being contained at the protocol level. For example there's criticism that its scripting language is far too abstract. This is good for on boarding the web developer crowd and pumping the coin, but very bad for writing and auditing code that handles finances. See DAO.
Competing smart contract implementations on top of the Bitcoin network can experiment with different languages, hopefully ones much more strict such as Haskell. Of course Ethereum can always Hard Fork again to change their scripting language (lol), but Bitcoin will always have way more flexibility here. And that's just one example where different implementations can experiment and compete. There's no point in being first to market with something if you can't do it right. 
@_date: 2016-07-04 01:00:13
Author here.
The friction of fuller blocks is only temporary. The question is is it worth damaging Bitcoin's decentralized nature to some X degree in order to alleviate this more quickly than it otherwise will be. No we don't know how much it will hurt decentralization and that remains hard to measure, but the cost is not zero. 
Given the fact that primary roadblock for consumers to adopt bitcoin for everyday purposes it volatility, not the effects of fuller blocks, I don't see how the trade off is worth it. People are free to experiment with all kinds of uses with Bitcoin once it's scaled in a more intelligent way. 
@_date: 2016-07-03 20:37:05
Author here, thought I'd address your points. 


I go on to argue for that conclusion using average transaction values which correlate the argument that Bitcoin's current use case is as an investment and speculation vehicle. Transaction throughput is simply not the current bottleneck when it comes to making it a viable mainstream tool for smaller transactions. It's volatility. Therefore increasing the block limit won't drive adoption in this area any faster and can only put more centralizing pressure on the network. 
However due to the immense consensus needed for a safe hard fork, I would argue the burden of proof rests on big block advocates to show why a 1MB will hurt imminent growth. I see little reason and no evidence for this. 


I'm not sure why you perceive this as a strawman, and your points are missing the mark here. Buying and holding Bitcoin is a risky move no matter how you cut it. When it comes to your typical expenses and shopping needs your average consumer does not want the extra head ache of worrying about exchange rates, tools to hedge themselves, etc. There's just too much work and effort involved when they just want an easy way to spend their money. 
Bitcoin's ability to act as a medium of exchange on an independent network is important, but using it to buy coffee is not where *main* growth is going to come from as long as it remains excessively volatile. A 2% discount here and there for using Bitcoin isn't enough to make up for worrying about volatility for the average consumer. And they can use apps like Venmo to send money to their friends instantly for free without having to worry about any fluctuation. 


It doesn't really matter in context of fuller blocks, as both can pay marginally higher network fee's and still vastly outperform legacy speed and expenses. However remittances is still effected by volatility more so than speculation, which thrives on it. So I'd still expect speculation to play the largest role, then remittance, then smaller consumer uses down the line. Adoption is a gradual process. 


I'm not sure what you're referring to here. Blockchains need floating units to work in order to incentivize miners to secure them, and "permissioned" blockchains can't compete with actual blockchains. The whole reason bitcoin transactions are so cheap is because the network is completely separate from legacy systems. 


Every penny will become important once the price stops swinging enough to give some more experimental consumers some piece of mind. Other more risk adverse consumers will follow as it proves itself even more stable. I do agree that developing the protocol and L2 solutions is pivotal. The thrust of my article is to show that there will always be *some* security risks and centralization pressure from raising the limit, and no plausible benefit from doing so right now. 
@_date: 2016-07-04 03:22:24
Regardless of the specs and technological progress, all else being equal raising the block size limit has a negative effect on decentralization greater than zero. Therefore I'd argue the burden of proof is on those who want to increase the limit, to show that it would actually lead to greater adoption. I voice my doubts about this in the article. You can increase the number of on chain coffee purchases bitcoin can handle easily, but that doesn't mean consumers actually have any interest in buying coffee with bitcoin at the moment.

Interested in your thoughts: 
@_date: 2016-07-31 21:31:43
Personally I think Bitcoin will be the underlying core of a "financial web" as opposed to Ethereum. The protocol itself specializes in scale, security, and transactions. Everything else will be added on top of that or via sidechains. It's in these areas the Ethereum's wildcat experiments and mistakes will provide good lessons. 
As for CP specifically I think it might have come out a bit early. I think it has potential and the idea is great, but I don't find the implementation as elegant as it could be. Maybe it's a non-issue but perpetually burning coins as a feature at the least seems suboptimal to me. But that's the avenue they had available at the time. Will be interesting to see where they and other projects go. 
@_date: 2016-07-31 14:51:39
Quite developments like this are the best. We absolutely need more mind share to problem solve as Bitcoin gets steam. It's the only universal answer to solving Bitcoin's many problems in the face of scaling.
@_date: 2016-07-23 20:01:04
I think they are. They have different approaches but they're ultimately aiming to be the same thing, the backbone of a new financial web. There aren't two dIfferent TCP/IP protocols competing are there?
So I deff have my money on Bitcoin succeeding with its approach of being a dumb but secure base layer, with smart contract levels on top. Even the Lightning Network is essentially just a specialized smart contract layer. 
This is also why I support Core's approach to optimize this bottom layer as much as possible before just taking a brute force approach that may compromise security/decentralization. It's essential we get it right.
@_date: 2016-07-02 18:47:59
Banks are overrated imo although i agree with your timeline. 
I think we're overestimating what will happen in the next two years, and underestimating the next 10. The market cap will probably be much bigger in the next two thanks to institutional investment starting to flood in, but it will still be mainly a speculation vehicle. In 10 years we'll see some surprising developments as more and more individuals/businesses start favoring Bitcoin transactions over fiat. The crash of the Euro would help.

Author here. My intention was not to make a straw man argument, but to establish that block size increase alone obviously can't be relied upon. From there I move on to if there's any benefit to do so in the short term at all, and conclude there isn't given the bulk of Bitcoin's current use cases. 
Increasing the block limit to 2MB might not be that bad on nodes, but the cost isn't zero. Since I can't find any conclusive data or reasoning to suggest the current limit is actually slowing down growth and adoption there's no reason to pay that cost, even if it is hard to quantify.

@_date: 2016-07-04 14:59:10


Not accurate. My argument is that bitcoin is already incredibly inconvenient for a large set of consumers uses compared to existing alternatives. Therefore increasing Bitcon's capacity to process these transaction on chain doesn't change the fact consumers are not interested in making those transactions in any significant way. Volatility is the chief problem here followed by UX. For payments there's Apple Pay, and for sending money around instantly there's Venmo.


The transaction evidence simply correlates my main argument, and I admit it is swayed by large exchange movement. The median value since April 2015 however in 10 bitcoins. To me this is sufficient evidence to support my position, since the burden of proof should be on those pushing for the limit change to show how it would actually increase growth. I haven't seen any compelling argument for this. 
The average consumer is not going to be use it for coffee purchases any time soon as there's just no advantage to doing so vs other real alternatives. Increasing Bitcoin's capacity to handle these types of transaction on chain won't change this in the slightest. It's akin to investing resources in a part of a business with no demonstrable demand. The added resource requirement for nodes to do so is best saved to preserve the number of nodes at this time. Investment/speculation uses are unaffected by marginally higher fee's, so I see no reason to rush a hard fork. 
Remember this is all only temporary until SegWit, various other BIPs, and LN is deployed. 
Almost all developers to start, and is the easiest to demonstrate. 


Few are, but this point was simply to set up if doing so only in the short term instead was worth it. 


I can't predict the future. When will people be able to use Bitcoin? I'm not talking about some wallets and merchants, but a no-nonsense means without having to worry about if they can pay their bills due next week because of price swings. 
@_date: 2016-07-31 15:10:06
Speculated this as well. I figured that if price didn't immediately rise some miners may opt to sell some savings to cover for the lower block reward. And this drop isn't really that notable. We've been exceptionally stable and I hope it stays quite on this and the mempool front for the next few months.
@_date: 2016-07-16 12:36:33
I think they have a point. All that stuff is higher level understanding. The vast majority of people don't understand why you would need an alternate currency whatsoever to begin with. By exposing them to the concept via a viral hit like Go, along with immediate benefits like more customers, it opens them up to the idea more. It could very well pave the way for mainstream Bitcoin adoption.
@_date: 2016-07-04 01:10:16


The burden of proof falls on big blockers to prove this, not simply claim "of course they do". In this article I explain my doubts as Bitcon's growth at this stage is clearly coming from speculators, both small and large. Even without throughput problems, Bitcoin's killer function is not basic retail transactions or sending money in between friends. There's already much better solutions to those problems available to average consumers. 


I agree. The presence of better alternatives for scaling does though. It should be a last resort. 
 &gt;More people involved in Bitcoin means a higher price, more buy-in from companies, and ultimately a better image of Bitcoin to the world. Anyone thinking that this doesn't matter is stupid to be frank.
This rests on the assumption that increasing the block size somehow means more people flocking to Bitcoin. As I explain, the idea here is that a consumer gets a delayed tx while paying for a retail item or sending money to a friend and drops Bitcoin. But Bitcoin provides no real benefits in these use cases compared to competing alternatives like Apple Pay and Venmo. It doesn't matter how much you increase throughput to make more of these transactions possible in the short term. There's no reason consumer's would flock to it from those alternatives.
