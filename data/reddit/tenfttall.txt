Yeck. Great response, thanks. But I think the whole idea is to expand her purchasing power with the Bitcoin, right? I mean, if I'm right to "sock away" savings for her, then we wouldn't need to convert to cash at all, therefore there is no tax, right? Or am I missing something?

Seems like I may be wrong. 
From the [article](
**"Where’s the hidden fee, what’s the catch, how do you make money?”**
We’re interested in the long-term value of digital money, not optimizing for minor short-term profit. We will have future, higher-level products that we fully intend to be revenue-generating, but this first basic product needs to be free. That’s the cost of mainstream consumer adoption.
The Circle conversion rate may fluctuate higher or lower than that of various services and exchanges at different points in time, and some may view that as margin, but it’s simply never a revenue generator if we’re using it only as a means to mainstream currency conversion (which we are). We are not a trading platform."

I can't stand rocking when I'm in here
Because your crystal ball ain't so crystal clear
So while you sit back and wonder why
I got this fucking thorn in my side
Oh my, it's a mirage
I'm tellin' y'all it's [ARBITRAGE](

Has anyone else ever considered that Bitcoin may be a Trojan Horse? Maybe it's a silly idea, but since we don't know who created it, is there any chance that the creation isn't all it seems to be?
