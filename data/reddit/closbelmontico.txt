Everybody should have equal possibilites in life! If you have tallents in sports or in science but you can't realise your talents because you don't have money - its awful

Enough for living, but enough only for food and some little things. People can't travel, can't buy even cheapest used car or new cloth. Old people's pension enough for food and for utilities, isn't it sad?

What if a kid from a poor family or a grandma's grandchildren aren't rich? A kid from poor family doesn't deserve to go to college even if he has good marks? Or grandma who has tumor doesn't deserve to live if she has pension 200$ and doesn't have enough money to be treated ?
@_date: 2017-12-20 12:48:15

This question was actual in 2013, 2014 and is actual now
@_date: 2017-12-27 08:06:02
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:52:57
some people don't use bitcoins because they don't know how or they don't trust crypto currency and feel more comfortable holding paper money in their hands
@_date: 2017-12-21 12:06:27

@_date: 2017-12-26 16:35:44
I see. I just read so many panic lines here on reddit.
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:35:15
Fees are too high and the transaction is too slow. Hope soon it gets better

I only suggest that goverments from all over the world provides for their citizens fullfiling basic things, I don't mean free mercedes or bank account with 20k $ for everyone, I don't mean split everyone's money between all. No, I mean clear water for drinking, health care and education for everyone. Every human deserveres so that his rights are fulfilled - "The European Convention on Human Rights"

In some countries 1 BTC is enough for 6-9 month of living. Or even longer
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:07:29
Real HODLer ;)
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:03:10
I was saying about people from other countries who have salary less then 1 BTC, for example with a salary 300$ - they can't even afford one bedroom apartment, they can rent  bed in a room with few strangers, pay utilities and bought the cheapest food. Of course they won't die, they continue to live, but is this life good? IMHO
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:39:32

Agree. Sachs claims that bitcoin is a bubble and at the same time bought Poloniex.
