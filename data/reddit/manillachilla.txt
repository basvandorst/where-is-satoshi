Best advice is that no one here knows fuck all and ignore it all. Research how it works, decide if you think its worth it based on the technology (not the hype) and then figure out how much you can lose if you really think its worth it. Certainly don't listen to people making predictions about 20-30 years when it's your money.

Yeah I've seen that too today. Very different than normal and reeks of brigading.

You can buy Bitcoin directly from coinjar but need to get verified. Once you're verified you can link a bank account. Once that bank account is verified, you can BPay to coinjar directly, and then immediately exchange that to Bitcoin. Once you have the Bitcoin you can either leave in in there (not recommended) or you can transfer it to a wallet that you control. Both the buying of Bitcoin and the transfer will enact a transfer fee of 0.005 btc (~$4 aud). I can't really tell if this is a good deal or not tbh, it seemed alright for me because I invested about $400 through them. But someone who has been buying/selling longer would need to chime in.

Good on him, doesn't mean taking a loan to buy Bitcoin is a good idea. Just means it worked out for him.

Wait sorry I was wrong. So when you transfer to them, it goes to your "cash account". This is a b-pay and does not enact a fee. When you convert from your "cash account" to "everyday bitcoin" (this is essentially you buying bitcoin from them), they will take 1% of the payment. So if you're transferring $50 from your cash account to bitcoin, they will take a fee of 50c. However, once you have btc in your "everyday bitcoin" account, moving it to a more secure wallet will enact a 0.0005 btc charge. So the more you move from your "everyday bitcoin" account with them to a secure wallet, the better the deal. 
Hope that makes sense.

yeah that's a shocking idea
