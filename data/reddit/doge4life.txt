Yea his story doesn't check out. I'd like to see the actual transcript of his Newsweek interview though.
@_date: 2014-02-25 05:06:11
Who exactly lied to you, was it Karpeles himself? What did they say?
@_date: 2014-04-10 23:14:01
Yea until the FBI busts down your door for storing someone else's child porn.
@_date: 2014-04-09 12:08:27
Fuck off

It's a different kind of stealth. It means you can publish a single address everyone can use to pay you but without the payers being able to see what other people are paying you. 
Try using your shift key once in a while please.

You don't publish the nonce in advance. You publish it after the fact. That's the whole point.
"allow attackers to verify their result" - brute force the nonce given the name?

If this was Transaction Malleability we'd see multiple transactions with the same amounts going to the same wallets on the blockchain.
Where are they?
@_date: 2014-04-10 23:13:08
So what? He paid $182 on average.

Backup your ferret and you'll be fine
@_date: 2014-02-25 05:33:08
Ask Karpeles! You have his number right?
@_date: 2014-03-07 07:46:39
This address contains a really weird number of bitcoins. The only currency that I can see where the numbers could mean something is JPY - at the time of the transaction this address received almost exactly 800 billion Yen.
@_date: 2014-02-10 11:11:49
The limit is fine for now. Eventually we'll just increase the block max from 1MB to 10MB or whatever. Don't worry it's not a problem unless you're trying to do microtransactions on the blockchain. Knock that shit off.

Can you confirm that Gox lost 700k BTC? Since you seem to have contacts on the inside?

Close enough.

How about trading while insolvent?
@_date: 2014-08-25 06:49:25
Where are you
@_date: 2014-03-07 07:25:07
I agree, it's probably him.
@_date: 2014-02-21 10:30:53

He moved to America when he was 10. His english is very good, watch his video interview.

Where was Dorian when this post was made?

The NSA can track where the NSA money went, yes. But not money sent by anyone else. If you receive tiny amounts of money just ignore it if you're worried about the NSA.

Satoshi almost never signed messages ever. See if you can find one on any public forum.

Use a tumbler
@_date: 2014-02-25 05:24:57
Also their name is mud right now. Nobody wants anything to do with Gox any more.
@_date: 2014-04-10 03:43:50
Yea so if you want to type it, use ฿ cause it's the closest we have to the double vertical bar B.
@_date: 2014-03-03 06:21:35
Mark's number is in there and it's evening in Japan. Someone please call him! I want to know how many coins he still has.
@_date: 2014-03-07 07:33:21


LOL are you serious nigga?
@_date: 2014-02-25 05:20:12


How do you know that
@_date: 2013-12-26 04:27:14
Giving Bitcoin as gifts is fucking retarded. Do you give people money as a Christmas gift? NO! Why would it be OK to give them Bitcoin?
You people are seriously autistic or something.
@_date: 2013-12-18 11:11:24
As if straight BTC is not volatile enough already!
@_date: 2013-12-18 11:17:02
You should have bought 30k DOGE instead
@_date: 2013-12-18 11:46:13
What's the bottom
@_date: 2013-12-18 11:45:10


Wrong, because more bitcoins are being mined every day. The influx of new money must exceed the rate of newly mined coins to sustain the price.
@_date: 2013-12-18 11:12:51
Bitcoin is the most entertaining thing on the webbernets
@_date: 2013-12-19 10:52:42
No DOGEcoin yet? :(
@_date: 2013-12-18 11:18:44
DOGE will prevail though, because it's really really funny

I give it 6 months max before Visa and Mastercard cut them off
@_date: 2013-12-26 22:20:04
If everyone just gave everyone else money for Christmas, wouldn't that be really fucking retarded?
@_date: 2013-12-18 09:01:31
Good news only on this sub or something like that
