If everyone sent that exact message then they'd just think they got hit by a spambot.
Type it yourself, it'll seem more genuine and is less likely to get caught in a spam filter. Just something short and sweet. Don't need an essay.

They probably just haven't updated it. They don't even read their own ToS lol

My issue is with PayPal. They can freeze your account at any time, and while the transaction fees aren't outrageous, it's still my money they're taking just because I used their service.
I work online so that's about my only way to get paid. I'd like to start asking for Bitcoins instead but I'm afraid they'll be illegalized soon.

I was looking into mining with BFL ASICs but I was really on the wall about it. I'm glad I didn't buy one. I dodged a bullet there.

I already sent the letter, but I did mention PayPal in it, if briefly.

I wrote my own letter that doesn't have any external links. Ones with links might hit a spam filter.
It's a bit lengthy, but I think it holds one's attention and gets the message across.

Yeah, I picked up on that vibe. 
"It's so complex, it might be used for terrorism." That statement just screams ignorance and post-9/11 paranoia.

Not necessarily. It's still letting him know what I think on the issue.
My rep is Dunham, California. He's focused on agriculture and jobs. That's why I tried to hit on Bitcoin's potential benefit for the economy.
