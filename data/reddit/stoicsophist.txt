That's the most optimistic timeframe for *one* organization to *begin* their attempts to mine an asteroid. If everything goes right, they will bring back 150 kilos of asteroid, containing a small amount of precious metals. It'll be awhile before it will have the ability to affect the price of those metals.
Of course, the kicker is that if it does manage to bring prices down, even a little, that will directly undermine the cost effectiveness of mining it from asteroids.

So it can send you a text to remind you that you're out of ice cream, obviously.

Uh, no, it has to outweigh the costs for the consumer while *simultaneously* not eliminating the profit margin for either 21 Inc. or anyone they partner with to offer those incentives. That's a much harder needle to thread.
