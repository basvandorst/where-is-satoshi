Are there any decent ASIC alts left, or am I stuck with GPU mining if I want to try my luck again?

Making money is so fucking hard when losing it is so fucking easy. I'm sorry for your lost.

I think $30k will be my 50% out point, then I'll just keep slowly buying more as it keeps rising.

I mean, I'm not in it to get rich, anyways. Missed that boat by a few years, haha. If it hits 30k and I cash out half, I'll get a couple Grand, and if it doubles again, I'll have another couple grand. If it crashes the next day, at least I'll have a couple Grand. Not bad for sitting on $79 worth, ya know? I'm never going to be wealthy, but at least it'll be enough to afford to do something nice for my family here and there.

OK, I'm not going to beg for a tip, but how does this work? I've seen bits and pieces of an explanation, but I'm still a little confused. I have a couple dollars in bitcoins, but I don't know how to make the whole changetip thing work.

If we had enough to sell at $500 to live worry free for many years, I don't any of us would have been too bothered in hindsight, it's not like he sold it all for a used car or something, he's sitting on an easy quarter million.

The $80 or so I mined a few years ago is worth $1500 (Wish I hadn't spent some on games a few years back...), so I think I'll keep HODLing for a while and keep cursing myself for not having bought some (or even being able to afford some) when I was a sophomore in highschool.

I've decided to just buy him out myself, but I appreciate the help and offer!

I've got to check something tomorrow morning, but if that doesn't work, would you be interested in buying $150 worth? That way my friend can cash out and I can HODL

I wrote this comment on the blog, and am just posting it here too. This is based purely on the experience of my friend and I (he paid for it, I was doing all of the stressful work). 
I ordered a 5 GH/s unit about 5 months ago, and received it about a week ago. While I am very disappointed in the fact that I had to wait almost triple the time that they had said it would take, and having my request for a refund denied, all in all, my little miner is working OK. It actually mines at 8.5 GH/s, and makes a steady little trickle of income hooked up to my mining pool of choice.
-Is it going to make me rich? No.
-Is it going to pay for itself and it's electricity consumption in a timely fashion? Probably not.
-Is it going to tell me that I am handsome and smart?
Most definitely not.
-Was it worth the 300 that my friend loaned me to pay for it? Honestly, I don't really feel that it was a worthwhile investment. 
--Given all of it's faults, many of whom are directly due to BFLs poor customer service and production time, I will still run it until either it isn't worth it at all, or it dies. If nothing else, at least I can say that I 'was there' when Bitcoin really began to take off.﻿
