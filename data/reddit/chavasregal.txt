It's ok they'll soon be using xRapid / xCurrent and saving them a fortune ��

Thanks ��
Well, we'll have to see what the future holds for them.

So you're saying there is no need to worry about BitMain having control of the lions share of hashrate? 
@_date: 2018-08-23 13:28:04
The 58% of all hash rate controled by just 4 closely related chinese mining firms.

Keeping it more sovereign? It's controlled by Chinese miners... ��

Can't say I did, been too busy with a newborn.

A little  cooperation and a 51% attack, double spends.
I'm not saying they are going to, my point was that BTC is not sovereign to the USA.

But with PoW those with the money can accumulate the most hashrate, generating more money and ultimately adding more hashpower, increasingly centralising the network further.
Personally I don't see it getting any better.

Because the worlds poorest always follow the billionaires on twitter, so he's helping no-one really.

Get a floating shelf and hollow out a space on the back that sits next to the wall, then stash your stash and put your shelf up.

Because HSBC only make money from transactions, right?...
Wrong. 
@_date: 2018-11-09 14:30:00
Because they didn't use xRapid.

What about those that put themselves in debt to buy bitcoin? 
@_date: 2018-07-17 15:50:29
Do you have to wait for it to clear before you can spend a penny? There could be a few damp patches ��

So what's he gonna do put one BTC up for 280k on an exchange and then buy it himself, winning his own bet?
