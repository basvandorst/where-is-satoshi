um, wat? My only guess is you are confusing bank loans with government subsidies for stuff like foods stamps and housing programs, because those are things that are not expected to be payed back. But those both have nothing to do with banking, this post or 2008 financial crisis. (that last one is debatable I guess)

I don't think 'never' is a good word to use, but yeah probably not in the next few years.

Him being part of the cypher punks wasn’t just important because they were interested in sociopolitical change. The cypher punk mailing list is literally where the bitcoin white paper was posted as well as most of the cryptographic research that led up to bitcoin (hashcash pgp etc)

It's not that simple, low-grade inflation for a currency which dominates use over a group of people (like USD does in America) because it encourages people to spend the money which is slowly loosing value, thus increasing spending which helps the American economy. That being said high deflation is also good for a startup currency like bitcoin. When the value of bitcoin increases more people want to participate.

Yeah, but why not replace it with a crypto currency with a government backdoor that allows them to track transactions?

This presumes you have choice in the matter.

As a programmer I love eth. Is Mary contracts are awesome I just wrote a p2p five card draw and it was so much fun. On the other hand I don’t on any eth and don’t plan on it.
