That's why it's not a perfect solution and we need to work to find a better one. We also haven't found a perfect solution for putting a man on the moon.

Could I cache the results from your service for an hour and charge 10 satoshis though? I'd make money if there are even a few requests per hour.
In fact, the more requests per unit of time I get, the less time I have to cache results for to make money.
Also, wouldn't transaction fees make this cost a lot more?

IDK, all I know is that it seems to auto-calculate fees that work well for me.

Sorry :(. Looks like you're the only one that fell for it though.

I wouldn't worry about it too much, just make sure not to double spend them.

Your download isn't working. Try uploading it to  which will provide hosting and static analysis.
Edit: also, sorry about the trolls. Now's not really the time.

It looks like it probably isn't. See the thread here:

I was trying to figure out what the width of the rectangles meant &gt;.&lt; (I thought it might be alternating width and height values). Maybe try to make the puzzle more linear (both literally and figuratively :P) next time.
I'll have to keep in mind that you're a programmer too (I figured so though, given the puzzle).
Edit: any way to get a reddit notification when your next puzzle goes live BTW? I'm pretty sure remindmebot can't do it. I guess you could just PM me, but that'd be a pain on a larger scale.

How does Electrum do this? It seems to automatically calculate fees.

I would send that to their BTC address directly (14bNP5krJeBPGT6xYWdfQYD4veNC9nLiib) - they probably don't have changetip setup.
