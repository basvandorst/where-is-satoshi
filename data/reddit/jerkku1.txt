Well maybe he first sold all and then bought a few back.

What about those who lost their wallet.dat?

The 1mb cap won't be enough even as a settlement layer.

Nah perfect meritocraties don't exist, there are always other factors as well. Claiming that core maintainers are perfect objective humans who impose perfect meritocraty is just bullshit. They might have good level of meritocraty, however even that is up to a question because it is very difficult to objectively measure.

Well, when it isn't a bitcoin app any more, it is a bit unfair to rate it badly because it doesn't have bitcoin. With similar logic one could give one star ratings to paypal and venmo apps, or many other apps which don't have bitcoin.

I don't really understand why tjis would be common use-case. Even with long-term savings you sometimes want to liquidate them. For example if you get a terminal illness and your life plans change dramatically because of that. Would feel pretty bad to have the bitcoins locked at that situation.

Yeah, initially ross was a vendor on the site himself, selling shrooms and weed if I remember right. But he quit pretty quickly once the site became popular.

Lol it was a joke

I'm not interested in that discussion, whether he belongs to jail, or whether it was ethical or yadda yadda. Just want to state the facts. 
I was following SR very early on, and initially ross (or dpr) was the only vendor there, because at first he had to get the ball rolling. After a while other vendors flocked in and that wasn't necessary any more. It was really interesting to see that developing, because nothing like that had existed before.

Also they had guns at first but those never took on.

I kind of disagree, in some things bitcoin sucks. For example as a toilet paper.

... for dealing drugs. I think only a little else was sold there.

I think pretty many who were around in 2011 in the bitcoin scene followed silk road developing quite closely. DPR (the site operator back then called himself dreaded pirate roberts) openly sold drugs there, before vendors had found the site. It was fascinating to follow the development of the site and boy it grew fast. At the same time bitcoin rose from one dollar to peak 33 and I think that was mostly thanks to silk road.

I think it is viable, being a dev myself. That kind of marketplace isn't rocket science to develop. He didn't probably sell that much, only at first to prove that it works and to get the ball rolling (get other vendors in)
@_date: 2016-12-15 21:54:27
Well that is very difficult to know for sure, but personally I think it was the same DPR all along. The reason why I believe so are his libertarian texts etc, he was very vocal throughout the time he was running the site. However I have to admit I didn't follow that very much in the later stage.

Depends on the jurisdiction. Patents are enforced differently in each country.

This. People are making a too big fuss about this BU shit. Focus on useful stuff, such as moonbeam.
@_date: 2017-04-06 06:24:27
Well also the protocol isn't the law.
@_date: 2017-04-06 06:25:13
Well sleazy maybe, but not illegal. Good thing that now we know the reason.
