USD withdrawals are being denied by Wells, deposits work fine. Swiss francs, Hong Kong Dollars, and cryptocurrency withdrawals are processing. There's currently no ETA on reinstating USD withdrawals, but we're working on a number of currencies to provide additional options as quickly as possible.

We're not going to rollover for action like this. It's precisely why we have increased our legal department.
The decision to initiate legal action is because we cannot allow precedents in this industry where clearing houses can disrupt businesses that are by all metrics complying with the rules in place.
If we allow them to simply flip a switch and disrupt business, then there becomes a precedent in the Bitcoin industry beyond just Bitfinex, so we believe it is the appropriate time to take action to prevent precedents.

Just to clarify the note about "no more BTC coming in," [here]( you can view that we are actually basing on withdrawals for the past week due to increased BTC deposits. Naturally, there was an initial withdrawal run beginning around the 2nd week of April; however, we do not have any functional concerns regarding cryptocurrencies operating as usual and users are free to deposit and withdrawal cryptocurrencies at will.
Domestic wires within Taiwan are moving and helping to relieve some of the premium pressure. As additional channels come online, we expect the premium to naturally dissipate even further. 
There's no discounting the fact that the banking situation has created concern among the community. We're acutely familiar with this and are working tirelessly across the globe to remedy this for our userbase. It's certainly not an overnight solution to install, but we're confident in the progress we're seeing in these pursuits and look forward to publicly announcing milestones as they are achieved.

Are you asking how we managed to recover since last year? If so, by all means it was a community-driven effort.
Under no circumstances would the outcome of the tokenized loss have been remotely possible if the community did not rally behind us by increasing usage of the platform, choosing to convert to equity, and the addition of prudent contingency reserve usage. The month of March saw a record 30 day volume for us, over $2 Billion.

The argument that redemption vs. conversion is one being right and one being wrong befuddles me. No one's hand was forced to do either, there were even more options; trade, lend, collateralize, and/or exchange them.
The large amount of token conversion to equity holdings of iFinex appears by all metrics to be a resounding signal that there is a core community among us that considers the value of holding ownership as being so worthwhile that they were not interested in selling their tokens, trading their tokens, nor waiting a mere 8 months for redemption of their tokens.
The model to tokenize this event was specifically designed to provide our community with a choice. There is historical precedents of what happens if we had chosen the simpler avenue.
Under no circumstances would this have been remotely possible if the community did not rally behind us. We are sincerely grateful and excited about new possibilities arising from sharing ownership with our core community.
@_date: 2017-04-28 12:16:06
The audit is more imminent than ever now that the tokens are retired; auditors have noted that resolution of the tokens were necessary before coming onboard. I agree that we've noted the audit is coming for some time now, but now that the token era has ended, we're looking forward to announcing the details that are currently in development.
Regarding Bitfinex and Tether, **both are solvent** from not only a technical and legal standpoint, but also from a common understanding of being solvent. **Asset to liability coverage ratio is &gt; 1** for both iFinex (and its subsidiaries) and for Tether.

The event you're referencing was a theft in an unregulated market that affected the community and us as a platform for them to trade upon. ​The model to tokenize this event was specifically designed to provide our community with a choice rather than to force their hand. There is historical precedents of what happens to users and the exchange if we had chosen the latter/simpler avenue.
​​The argument that redemption vs. conversion is one being right and one being wrong is structurally unsound; there were yet more options; trade, lend, collateralize, and/or exchange them.
 
In the event Bitcoin rolled over and entered a bear market, the story of users desiring the BTC holdings back would have occurred in reverse order of operations, demanding the USD value at the point prior to the down trend. We cannot chase the value of a volatile asset in such a situation. The outcome of price &gt; $604 or price &lt; $604 is 50/50 probable. Either side of $604 changes the argument to the more favorable outcome, naturally.​

The issue has been USD out; to which, we've implemented new currencies to allow fiat out. Currently, you can withdraw Swiss Francs (CHF) and Hong Kong Dollars (HKD). USD wire deposits are working as usual and have been. We're working expeditiously to implement new currencies for withdrawal and should have some insight on that next week.
These options will be added to the UI as soon as possible, but in the interim, we are making them happen via support

Funds are not frozen, but Wells Fargo as a correspondent is delaying our withdrawal process. We have alternative channels available to us and are working on processing withdrawals at a delayed pace due to the operational overhead involved. In the meantime, we are taking action to re-institute outbound wire transfers as normal. This is not a regulatory action upon us.

Patently false. Rigid consistency in trading is not only the design nature of algorithmic bot activity, but also the hallmark of a seasoned trader. We monitor manipulative behavior moment by moment and address it with the individual trader/s. Shifts in volume and price spikes are the nature of a small market cap asset in its nascent stages. You will notice on longer time frames that almost every market absorbs this behavior. Market activity will naturally erupt around specific technical levels, as well.

Part of the process involved with having a third-party audit performed is the retirement of the BFX tokens. Now that that has been accomplished, it’s much easier, from a crypto-standpoint, for an auditor to review the cryptocurrency storage and bank accounts to understand that “Yes, this is all the cryptocurrencies in your possession and it's plain to review all of your accounts and balances." Prior to this, it would be far more costly, complex for the auditor, and time-consuming for the audit to be performed.
Further, we've been discussing snapshot reports on a quarterly basis moving forward, but the details are still in discussion.
I'm looking forward to being able to release new information regarding this in the near future.

A premium exists due to the increased buying pressure while we develop additional banking channels. As these channels begin to open, the pressure is expected to resolve naturally.
Please see our [latest announcement]( and the corresponding announcements within.
To be absolutely clear, Bitfinex is solvent. We have assets that exceed all user balances. We also want to emphasize that digital token trading is not affected on Bitfinex. We are developing facilities for different currencies, but in the interim, customers are welcome to trade and to undertake financing on Bitfinex and to deposit and withdraw smoothly using the available suite of digital tokens.
​Wire withdrawals can be cancelled and have the USD credited back to your Bitfinex account for use. Wire deposits will be returned to the originating sender's bank account. Cryptocurrency deposits and withdrawals are functioning normally. This is a case-by-case process and our support team is working expeditiously to process requests.

[Announcement 1](
[Announcement 2](
* We voluntarily dismissed our case and find that we're best served focusing our efforts on existing and developing banking relationships.
* Accordingly, all customers are able to withdraw in Swiss Francs (CHF) and Hong Kong Dollars (HKD). We're reviewing additional channels via Japanese Yen (JPY), Australian Dollars (AUD), Canadian Dollars (CAD), and Euros (EUR).
* It is our intention to also accept deposits from and list additional trading pairs against the new currencies.
* While we develop these additional fiat offerings, we're disabling fiat deposits until further notice.
* Cryptocurrency deposits and withdrawals are functioning as intended and are available to all.
* We are acquiring an independent audit. We're *perfectly solvent* and will be the only cryptocurrency exchange operating today to provide a proof of solvency in such a manner - not only by public request, but because we believe it is necessary.
* Information regarding last August is still sensitive in nature and part of an ongoing investigation with agency involvement; as such, we cannot release information publicly that could compromise the work being performed. Information release is pending resolution of the investigation process.
Reputation is important, we're working hard to improvise and adapt to the changing landscape in this industry.

None of this precludes our efforts to institute new currencies for deposit, withdrawal, and trading against. As milestones are achieved, we will make sure the public is aware. We're not resting.

The odd thing about r/bitfinex is that we don't have control of it, the one moderator of that sub doesn't work for us, It was created over 4 years ago by someone we don't have contact with. In the meantime, we've been obliged to answer questions in there because the community presumed it was an official Bitfinex sub, but it's not. I contacted the mod about 12 days ago to ask information about the sub and whether or not I could be added to the mods there, but never received a response.
I've responded to queries daily, the latest ones were/are in that sub before the mod privatized it. When he did so, my latest messages were hidden.
Unfortunately, even I'm locked out of that sub now. I'm not sure why it was privatized, but the last public r/ message I saw from the mod was around 2 weeks old.
