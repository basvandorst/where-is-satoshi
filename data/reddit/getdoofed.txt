Two buddies and I will be riding motorcycles from May to July from Lima, Peru to Brazil for the World Cup and then to Santiago, Chile afterwards. Planning to spread the word of bitcoin everywhere I go!

My friends rode their motorcycles from Minnesota to Perú this Spring/Summer. Everyone told them they were insane and going to be robbed/die, especially in Mexico and Colombia, where people ended up inviting them into their homes and feeding/lodging them for free. I also have other (female) friends that hitchhiked from Bolivia to Colombia this year without any issues. My experience in South America was phenomenal, friendly people everywhere I went and I felt far safer in the poorest towns than I do in slummy parts of US cities. Don't be an idiot or a pussy and you'll probably be fine.

I think that the innovation of the blockchain will change how the stock market works.  24/7/365 will become the new norm and stockbrokers will become obselete.  Perhaps you will even be able to buy small fractions of a share of stock, increasing liquidity, eliminating cost barriers and increasing investment in the entire market.

FRB allows banks to loan out MUCH more money than is actually deposited due to the multiplier effect. 
This is simply NOT POSSIBLE with Bitcoin.

This only would work as long as the transfer of "Bitcoins" is completely off-chain. You simply cannot spend Bitcoins you don't actually control. For example, let's say users A, B and C decide to send their Bitcoins to a different wallet, the 17 extra "Bitcoins" "created" by Coinbase would have to come directly from another user or group of users' account(s). They cannot just be pulled out of thin air. Wallet services like Coinbase will be under pressure to prove their assets match their liabilities or they will be considered inherently risky enterprises.

They actually just changed it to $0.10. Don't think that's too prohibitive...

You should read The Singularity Is Near by Ray Kurzweil. His theory is that evolution is really the evolution of the storage of information. In this respect, I believe Bitcoin is, without a doubt, the most highly evolved way to store the economic information of who owns what.  I also think that Bitcoin is likely the single largest jump towards technological singularity that we have ever witnessed.
