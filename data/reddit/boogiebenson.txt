Oh man, I should not have opened this link... haha!

I keep missing to sell at ATH and to buy during dips. Just hodling all the way!

Would you recommend this book to someone who is not a programmer or has no coding knowledge at all?
@_date: 2017-12-05 07:51:40
Because the maximum supply is limited to 21million BTC.
@_date: 2017-12-29 17:29:25
Wow, nice call!
@_date: 2017-12-21 14:20:39
I wish I had one with 150 BTC on it. :)

Do it! I can highly recommend the Nano S. Took me a while to figure out its potential, but once you get the hang of it, it's awesome. They have a subreddit which answers most common questions, in case you need help.

Yes. And technically they are not “stored” on the ledger itself.
@_date: 2017-11-24 19:21:55
Where's the Mustang? ;)

How do you keep track of the average price of your holding? Blockfolio?
@_date: 2017-11-24 19:10:00
This. And uninstalling an app doesn't mean your coins are gone, they are still there, so no worries!
@_date: 2017-11-24 19:12:04
- makes using Etherdelta a lot easier.
@_date: 2017-11-30 09:37:48
Just did!
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:37:05
Yes, so we can buy the dip!
@_date: 2017-11-24 19:17:00
Yes, you can store different currencies. But you need to install the corresponding app for each currency.
@_date: 2017-11-15 23:20:53
totally agree!
@_date: 2017-11-24 19:15:05
Yes. It is a hardware wallet, which makes storing your coins a lot more secure. You are not storing them on the device itself though, just the private keys, to which you have the password and the 24 word seed.

Me too, watched all his videos. Very informative and in a digestible way.
@_date: 2017-11-20 23:04:21
Nice! Now hodl those until you can sell 100

@_date: 2017-11-07 21:47:05
It is called "high frequency" trading.
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:49:05
You can buy a fraction of a coin, doesn't have to be a full bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-21 22:18:05
Awesome, congrats!!
@_date: 2017-06-12 22:41:56
What exchange would you recommend using then?
@_date: 2017-06-13 08:09:38
Thanks!
