He tipped me? Oh wow! Really? :)

I disagree. In my opinion money is the root of good. Because if you earned it in an honest way by making other people happy it will make you happy

HOLD YOUR BTC!
@_date: 2019-11-17 04:33:34
That's right! Who needs gold or bitcoin?

Yeah! Let's trust Fiat currency! The bills have cute designs on them -_-
@_date: 2019-11-17 06:02:21
Thank you :)
@_date: 2019-11-17 06:03:57
I'll make sure to take care of that! Thank you :)

I don't want to sell. I honestly don't believe that the dollar will have relevant value in the future :S I just want to hold my BTC and in the future use it when it's more accepted in society for day to day transactions. Is that a good plan? :3

I meant would I get in trouble by not reporting that income? How do I report it?

I’m not worried about the price, I’m worried about BTC adoption. If everyone gets scared and sells, that wouldn’t be beneficial for the adoption. I want BTC to be adopted as a global currency as soon as possible.

Thank you so much!  But what if I want to keep my BTC?
@_date: 2019-11-23 00:53:48
It depends! If someone wants to buy my BTC I'd sell it at a high price and buy more BTC right away lol
@_date: 2019-11-22 08:47:38
BTC just has value if we all use it as a currency! That's why as an NSFW model accept Bitcoin as money :3
@_date: 2019-11-27 01:52:23
Nope, he has 1 BTC

Do you know about the lightning network? :D I'm still trying to understand it. I'm thinking about buying a node
@_date: 2019-11-23 02:23:56
Hahaha that's a good one
@_date: 2019-11-17 06:02:38
Thank you!!!! :)
@_date: 2019-11-17 06:05:10
I'm thinking about implementing the lighting network as a payment method using BTC. Should I buy a node? :D

That's a good point! When you see a free video on the internet, that video was paid by a producer who hired the model. But the video was designed by the producer and everyone can watch it (he gets paid by running ads) the video is similar but not exactly what you want. But, what if you want a specific video from a specific model? What if you want the model to do very specific things while saying your name and wearing whatever you want? And even better, the content is just for you. Well, that's what I do, if you hire me you can get exactly what you want without being a producer or hiring one, without setting up a studio. You just pay a reasonable amount of money and get the content, I already took care of everything ;)
