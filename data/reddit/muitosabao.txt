Hi OP, to illustrate point, this is the general current (last 2 years) trend  
There is optimism but you need to keep in mind that it might not work and be worth 0 next year. Buy only what you can afford to lose.

ELI5?

why 100 upvotes?! this article is complete rubbish!!

 that's the price of bitcoin in Euros, for the last two years (last 800 days actually). Scale is logaritmic, which means the trend line in red is exponencial. If nothing makes it crash, this seems to be following the standard exponencial adoption of a new technology.

It's the first time I see it, since I'm a noob, so that's OK I guess

But he used three comas, he seems legit.

Except, like mentioned above, no one needs an armored car when all you want is to pay for a coffee! Is bitcoin a currency (to pay for your coffee) or just store of value (for your life savings) ? Both, hopefully...

You'll then have $45, 50% Roi 
@_date: 2017-01-17 13:25:58
Think so too. 
@_date: 2017-01-03 16:21:09
Oh, ok! Fair enough. And what about 2010?

from above "solving the math problems necessary to ensure transfers work securely.  Basically, the same math problems that guarantee transfers of bitcoins also generate bitcoins."

I get it. Thanks for the replies!

British prime minister speech. Markets take a hit 
Good for us, I guess? 
@_date: 2017-01-06 18:11:55
you read enough to know that it was preachy.
@_date: 2017-01-06 10:24:22
cmon, let us noobs have some fun too! You'd be bored without us.

Care to explain to a noob? 
Isn't it worth a million dollars if you'd cash it out?

Bitcoin volatility has been decreasing at steady pace, so way less than it used to be. 
@_date: 2017-01-07 22:38:03
the graph starts in Sep 2015, minimum in the 200ish dollars. Despite de peaks (the bubbles), the overall trend is pretty clear.

Crash? If you look and the progress of the last two years  (log scale, exponential trend line. Includes today's data) this seems pretty much business as usual. 
@_date: 2017-01-06 12:25:04
Apparently you did. 
@_date: 2017-01-14 16:19:12
Is it permanent? I'm not too far, maybe next time I visit the visit I drop by.

just yesterday I plotted this 
 which illustrates what you are saing.

He told him to watch! COMPLY!

Saw people speculating here, thought it was obvious and helpful to point out that it was Theresa May's speech. Yes, I'm new here :)

Just finished it after OP suggestion. Pretty good for an uninitiated bitcoin and crypto noob like me. Also, i got the feeling that that Craig Wright thing at the end, was just ironic, no? The fact that there was so little attention paid to it, felt like, "oh, and there's this guy here claiming he's Satoshi, but never mind"...
@_date: 2019-06-26 05:00:47
Dude where have you been? It dropped from 20 to 4k. That was The dip.
@_date: 2017-10-13 08:19:08
we're in the climbing part of the adoption phase.

I use bitpanda. Allows for Sofort Uberweisung payment. A bit more expensive but very fast.

Ah, so there's a problem then! I gifted my niece soke Eth and BTC on a paper wallet and was trying to recover them on Jaxx and showing her the mechanics of cryptocurrencies and it did not work. So there is an issue!...
