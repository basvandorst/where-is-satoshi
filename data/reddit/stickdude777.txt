Exchanges? Like when you buy or sell? Or when you trade. Pretty new to this

How do I do a sell order? Is there like a bot or desktop software I can get that does it for me?
@_date: 2018-05-11 22:25:05
I know I just wanted to know if there were anymore tips on checking daily or like something more that maybe I'm missing 
@_date: 2018-05-11 23:08:19
Also thanks again for the info

If im working with smaller amounts do you think I should use the same percents or wait till more or less. So far I only have 40cad of btc. Also thank you very much for all this info finally had some time to sit down and read this all in order to fully understand it.

@_date: 2018-05-12 01:03:12
Yeah I'm gonna look into that, thank your for the insight. So i assume a mobile or desktop wallet would be bad? Or can I just use the bank transfer to out funds into them?
@_date: 2018-05-11 23:09:14
Already have it but thanks tho

Ya I'm just trying to find a good way to deposit money without being fined and also a good way to buy sell and trade money quicklg probably gonna go with a desktop wallet until I can afford a hardware wallet 
@_date: 2018-05-12 00:56:54
Oh ok thanks, if I may I have another question. When I put money into the btc atm it took 5$ or so from my 40$ cad is there a way to get around that? Like if I buy online on a desktop program or will there always be a fee.

Thank you for your time and the help. 1. What's a limit buy order pretty new to this bitcoin thing so don't know a lot. 2. So when you buy do you buy 500$ at a time? 3. what's the smooth moving average? 4. What's the DCA purchase piece.  5. I understand what you said about buying but not selling, so you sell every time it rises by 0.6 but you only sell every 1800 seconds? Also where does the 2% profit come from?

I want to know if I did it right. So what I did was I scanned  the qr code from mycelium and than it asked me to deposit the money I wanted to put. Than it asked me for my email or sms, is that all I had to do?
@_date: 2018-04-30 23:39:58
Thanks 
@_date: 2018-04-28 01:22:06
Thanks I'm just worried
