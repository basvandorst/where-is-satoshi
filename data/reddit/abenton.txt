You only owe taxes on realized profit. If you never sold you don't owe anything.

Commenting just so I can show my kids when reddit actually, finally, went too far.
@_date: 2017-12-02 03:51:24
Damn I had $4 on that exchange, dollar menu on me!

unless it's monitoring for you to put in your private key
@_date: 2014-01-20 15:39:33
Cool story bro.
@_date: 2014-02-25 14:56:41
550/120,000+ is a small amount. Many people lost all their btc investment and lost everything they ever invested in the currency, period.
@_date: 2014-06-13 19:17:33
So if you but a share for .07BTC, you pretty much make your money back, with current trends, in like 10 months? Then it's all profit if all goes well?
@_date: 2014-06-27 03:16:34
I predict that this website will not be finished within two months
@_date: 2014-01-05 02:54:25
He apparently is running a site making scrypt rigs... I won't give the address to give him anymore publicity, but what a douche.
@_date: 2014-02-25 15:00:44
He was kind of like the megachurch pastor douche of bitcoin. Always trying to relate to the common investor while being, in fact, filthy rich.
@_date: 2014-01-09 18:50:02
That picture looks legit, let me open it.
@_date: 2014-03-11 18:20:10
Yes, but you'll have to send me 24.75btc to not post your gonewild account to your friends FB feeds.
@_date: 2014-01-09 17:56:46
He isn't going to answer and admit that *he* was the weak link in his security.
@_date: 2014-02-02 02:50:18
I'll say $100billion so you can now add me to the "I've heard guys say" line.
@_date: 2014-03-11 18:16:12
Good, no one has fallen victim *yet*
edit: it seems i spoke too soon
@_date: 2014-02-02 02:48:52
Seriously, I would much rather see it stabilize around $10mil/btc
@_date: 2014-02-02 02:51:05
Depends on your time frame.
@_date: 2014-01-08 20:15:52
He probably read this thread
@_date: 2014-03-03 13:58:07
Also mail them your first born child as collateral.
@_date: 2014-02-02 13:19:17
Really? Zoom out to even 3 months and show me the descend over that time.
@_date: 2014-03-11 18:54:27
Why would you do that? Ugh.. 
@_date: 2014-06-12 00:44:04
Their website takes VISA/Mastercard. 
Source: I bought jewelry from the site with mastercard
@_date: 2014-01-23 19:55:14
So basically do the opposite of what he says.
@_date: 2014-01-05 02:50:59
What in the fuck is this guy even talking about? It sounds scary that an exchange puts their users funds in cold storage? Does he understand that that's a good thing?
edit: wtf is the bell noise at the end?
@_date: 2014-01-16 17:36:28
This sounds like craigslist ads that say "have an idea that will be the new facebook! just need someone to do all the programming and design work (for free)!"
@_date: 2014-01-09 17:59:02
Not a very good day to admit that.
@_date: 2014-03-04 13:29:45
By conservative estimates maybe.
@_date: 2014-06-13 18:59:42
What kind of dividend does that work out to per share? And what is the time frame for the dividend payouts? Yearly?
@_date: 2014-01-08 20:18:03
How do you set something like that up? ELI5 please.
@_date: 2014-01-05 02:49:21

Dude, your son is worth more than any amount of money you'll ever make or save for him. You are his only father. Please go take him somewhere together and enjoy being a part of his life. Do not strip him of the right to grow up with a father.
@_date: 2014-01-15 18:14:37
Just curious, which ones?
@_date: 2014-01-15 18:15:07
There's always 2015

I mean as long as he's happy, that's a good way to use the funds when you cash out. There's never the perfect time, just a calculated, smart time for each of us to cash out if we need it

I too look forward to seeing 10k memes for the last time
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:54:03
I wouldn't say he's an idiot, he was HUGELY successful in business before he went down this road of drugs and mental illness. He is a decent mascot though, because he's about as level-headed as bitcoin is price-wise.
@_date: 2019-12-06 14:57:20
I have been bullish and hodling since mid 800s, where is your god now?

Well my father has been happily married to my mother for 35 years, and I have been happily married for 4. Maybe not everyone is the same? Not everyone chooses crappy partners? I know plenty of men who have been married more than 5 years and are happy.
@_date: 2019-04-10 12:14:28
Yeah man I am appalled, thought I was missing some weird sense of humor. Bunch of neck beard incels who get off on putting down other people's happiness. Congratulations @_date: 2019-04-10 12:32:33
Well I'm happy for you, but that doesn't mean you need to shit on other people's happiness.
@_date: 2015-07-15 11:17:26

I didn't realize he was engage to your ex wife, you should have mentioned that in your original comment, but then again I'm guessing that woman in the picture isn't your ex? But you know her much better than he does apparently.
@_date: 2017-05-06 00:10:45
Bro, this was an inside job.
@_date: 2019-05-23 20:15:20
No, I bought it on coinbase, and the only other place I ever sent/received to and from was poloniex and bittrex.
@_date: 2018-12-06 15:28:43
They have been here every time so far, what would be different about the next time?
@_date: 2013-12-09 16:36:45
Because they can't charge their users to use it (easily yet)
@_date: 2019-05-23 13:58:31
I was banned from Coinbase years ago with no explanation what-so-ever, with no communication. All I ever did was buy weekly, and withdraw/deposit from other wallets. They seem to have some secret voodoo something that marks accounts and bans them, but as to why, no idea.
@_date: 2013-12-04 19:14:31
I like cryptsy better but its 100x slower
@_date: 2013-12-17 13:37:12
I gotta say, even in this post, you guys are still going apeshit and speculating, debating, citing random websites you can't even read the language of. It's hilarious. 
@_date: 2013-12-13 17:57:09
2015 edition:
Fuck no. Fuck your shitty ass "currency". The fact that its value can drop from $1.5mil to $1mil in a day is the reason no true big business will ever even consider accepting it as payment.
As I see it, only the circlejerking retards on this reddit believe that they should use their own currency due to the belief that "the man" is keeping you down. Get a fucking job and stop playing with "money" that is worth less than monopoly money.
@_date: 2013-11-27 20:37:14
From one Soldier to another, what you did was incredibly stupid, but congrats on being lucky :P Best of luck to you!
@_date: 2013-11-28 21:51:21
And how exactly besides bitcoin do i make USD become bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-11-28 15:53:33
Yes, I bought 1 bitcoin on coinbase a few days ago that still hasn't cleared, and I want to put a good amount more in, but I can't because that transaction hasn't cleared yet. I also want to buy some LTC, but there is literally nowhere that will take my money. I would buy a few more BTC if I could but I can't :(
@_date: 2013-12-30 22:46:57
If I send you $1 in btc are you gonna mail me my cookie?
@_date: 2013-12-05 16:15:48

He can pay his taxes in bitcoins. After the FBI got silkroad they have a few addresses he could send to.

@_date: 2013-12-05 17:56:01
Be aware that cryptsy is the slowest piece of shit ever and you will miss the best times to trade... happened to me all yesterday.

Sorry if you thought I was a native speaker, I am proud to try to use my english. I have for many years been working in foreign-funded enterprises, although western banking is messy, especially Citibank. I just hold a real Chinese people's point of view of the problem. After this news came out, my colleagues said only two things: 
1. China's central bank was scared of BTC
2. I think it goes to the moon
Have to see to understand Chinese brothers, help translate it.
I may have fucked that up but I think that was the general gist?
@_date: 2013-11-27 15:13:46
Ah okay, I bought my first BTC yesterday morning, it's already turned a 17% profit, lol.
@_date: 2013-12-01 22:44:07
Please don't sell bro
@_date: 2013-12-10 17:28:49
Yes as long as you aren't building it to steal all my coins
@_date: 2013-12-05 14:22:23
Yeah, I contribute to a retirement fund, so playing around with my other money in digital currency doesn't make my butthole pucker quite as much, although who's to say my retirement fund will be worth a damn in 40 years anyways?

It's so damn hard to get my USD into bitcoins though, it's depressing.
@_date: 2013-11-27 15:07:59
Serious question... I am using coinbase but it takes forever for transactions to go through USD -&gt; BTC, is there a better way?
@_date: 2013-12-05 14:02:28
You aren't out if you have 1BTC in cold storage. That's called "long term investing".
@_date: 2013-12-05 17:44:17
Look into "dollar cost averaging". I am doing it.
@_date: 2013-12-05 02:20:34
They paid you a 1BTC kickback! Nice.
