But 2018 crypto to crypto is taxable (apparently)

Should people with something like Coinbase take their BTC off of that exchange because of lightning?
@_date: 2017-12-18 00:23:41
(Noob here) why will that happen Jan 1?
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:51:43
Any different thoughts again now that BCH is on coinbase?

You are (probably) wrong. BTC could stick around as a first mover, store of value, even if the tech is old because it doesn't need to be sophisticated.
Eth will definitely be 100% obsolete in the future as a more streamlined smart contract platform will come out at some point. Is that 5, 10, 15 years? Dunno. I'm not shitting on ETH at all. Its developers are doing the necessary legwork to pave the way for the future. There will just be something better later. Not that Eth couldn't adapt somehow, but it just seems unlikely. At some point adding on bells and whistles isn't as smooth as an out-of-the-box superior version.

No when we have alcoholics who have no intention of quitting admitted for things not related to alcoholism, we let them continue to have the occasional beer while admitted, as long as the beer is obviously not going to be detrimental. There is no point and doing benzos etc if they will just go back to drinking.

I admittedly don't have the strongest understanding of lightning, but I wonder that draw is most likely in the form of watchtowers or an equivalent... Obviously a major point of bitcoin is trustlessness, but still there is a degree of trust in LN if one doesn't have reliable internet. Perhaps at least to this degree, commercial entities could attempt to provide that trust.
Don't get me wrong, it is not desirable and it does run counter to the idea but it may be inevitable unless some sort of automated watchtower protocol can happen.

In the absence of an alternative reason as to why they would block withdrawals, the most reasonable answer is the most likely. Is it 100% certain? Of course not. But it remains the most likely. So stop acting like such a neckbeard and acknowledge what is staring you in the face: people are withdrawing their crypto and HitBTC doesn't want them to.
@_date: 2018-11-17 20:13:54
why march? genuinely curious
@_date: 2019-01-03 01:08:36
They certainly aren't freezing withdraws because they want them to remove their crypto.
So yes, it's the most reasonable answer. Aside from the fact that HitBTC is a shit exchange anyhow, what is another alternative since the stated one apparently is sooooo outlandish.

Alas there we have it. Unless something is 100% provable, we should ignore all correlation or suggestion.
You're trying too hard here.

Wooosh. That one went over your head.
@_date: 2018-02-22 03:52:57
And just to clarify what they said above. Any crypto on any exchange is not secure. The exchange could get hacked, fold, etc. and your crypto is just gone. Period. Little to no recourse.
So keeping a small amount on exchanges is fine, but larger amounts should be on your own private wallets.

I wish they'd let you send to segwit litecoin wallets with having to use a P2SH converter.

When you say halving do you mean the block reward halves? Or is this in reference to something else?
@_date: 2018-04-30 22:59:08
so are you thinking the price will half because fewer people want to mine it (because the reward halved)? Just trying to understand what you're putting down.

In the words of Morpheus: When you're ready, you won't have to.
It takes the dream of crypto where the banking/government middle man is removed, and makes it reality by making it nearly free.
Also, consider you are in fact paying the bank. Your money is inflationary, and they are loaning it out on interest. EVENTUALLY your crypto will be deflationary, meaning it appreciates in value by sitting there. Yes there are more nuances and details to the situation, but this is a basic summary.
Also bank tx are typically not instant. Yes some apps have been developed, like Zelle, but these are also typically capped to $500 a day.

I assume the tiny ass dot on the scale just as the yellow starts is 0?
