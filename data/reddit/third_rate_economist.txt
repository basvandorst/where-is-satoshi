And now he can't pay his taxes...Just kidding, he probably doesn't do the majority of his sales in bitcoin.

You're wrong though.  I'll give you a very flawed example to prove a point.  Say tomorrow no one was willing to buy gold anymore - no one wanted it as a store of value.  Gold is still valuable because it is useful.  People will still want to use it in electronics and for it's other essential applications.  Perhaps you're right in saying that intrinsic value is a purely human construct in that something cannot have intrinsic value without humans...
Your last paragraph is just wrong.

Fear of tungsten cores creates market pressures for gold producing companies to go to further lengths to ensure their customers that their product is genuine.  Ultrasound testing could be especially useful.

That's just value!  You can still value something that has no intrinsic value.  You could value a smile, you could probably buy a smile, but you can't do anything with a smile and so it has no intrinsic value.  
With gold, you value it (for whatever application), you can buy it, but you can also do something with it.  Whether that be making jewelry with it or throwing it at people to use as a weapon - it doesn't really matter.  The point is that bitcoin serves one and only one purpose.

Even fiat currency possesses some "intrinsic" value that bitcoin does not in a theoretical sense though.  We actually saw this happen in the Wiemar Republic.  Printed money became demanded as material to keep fires going and keeping people warm.  Due to the fact that fiat currency is physically existent, it technically could have value as something other than currency.  If money was in high supply and nothing else was I could build a shelter out of money but not out of bitcoins.

Props to you for at least listening to counter arguments.  Your first point about tungsten cores is true, and is definitely a concern; however, gold can still be verified by its density and there would also be market pressures in place that would encourage gold brokerages to provide proof to consumers that their product was genuine.  
Your last bit there doesn't make much sense to me.  The fact that bitcoin requires a vast network of computers to verify transactions is an issue.  If there a problem with this network, bitcoin becomes worthless.  Gold is physical and so this is not an issue.

I believe he may have been talking about the fact that gold is very immune to reaction with other materials and that it always maintains its density.  You can't really fake gold because one would always be able to measure gold's physical properties.

Could be a trading algorithm.  The time period is a bit long, but maybe?

Name one purpose that Bitcoin has that is not related to it being a currency or a holder of value.  
@_date: 2013-11-25 18:15:17
I think you're understanding a lot more than other people here.  The way I see it is that Bitcoin is only (ONLY) valuable because people are willing to accept it.  This is not the case with gold or fiat currency for that matter.

Scarcity is always an issue.  It doesn't matter if gold became so abundant that you used it as gravel in your driveway - it's still useful and thus has intrinsic value.

Perhaps appropriate use of the word inconsequential, but inconsequential does not mean zero.  You're right, a telephone is not very useful without a network, but it still has some "intrinsic" value.  It could be melted down and recycled, it could be used by a child as a toy, etc.  Bitcoin without a network is truly useless and valueless.  
@_date: 2013-11-26 01:36:44
I would agree with you there - I'm simply trying to point out that it is true to say that bitcoin has zero intrinsic value.
@_date: 2013-11-25 17:36:14
I have to disagree with you.  Gold has "intrinsic" value because it can be used, and its use is demanded, in various tasks.  It is used in electronics, as jewelery, aerospace, etc.  Bitcoins absolutely cannot be used for anything other than virtual currency.  
Whether you like it or not, this is a very important difference.  Say tomorrow there is a worldwide power outage or internet outage.  It would be more advantageous to have physical gold holdings rather than bitcoin.

This is very bad logic.  This "intrinsic" value we speak of is not really determined by an individual's perception of the good - in this case gold.  Gold is a physical good - bitcoin is not.  That means gold can be used for things other than simply a medium to hold value.  
The fact that gold can be used for something means that it has value.  The fact that you could build a bridge, a house, throw it at someone and kill them, make jewelry, use it as a conductor all mean that it has value.  You may not value it greatly and it may have too many substitutes for you to ever consider using it, you still have value for it.  It is only that the price for you is above your demand.  If gold was the price of gravel, you might find a use for it.
I'm using ridiculous examples to prove a theoretical point.  Bitcoin absolutely cannot be used for anything other than as a holder of value and so it has no intrinsic value.
