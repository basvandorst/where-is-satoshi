Mt Gox experienced a DDoS attack on 04/21/13. The price dropped roughly 15 USD immediately upon the exchange opening back up. Within 30-60 minutes, the price had [fully recovered]( 
The way a market determines a price of something is through people buying and selling it. In this regard, people  decide what the price is. If people panic, prices will drop. There seems to be enough owners of bitcoins who believe its value long-term that they are not influenced by panic selling. In fact, they view these drops as great buying opportunities.

That is some good analysis. With all of the volatility recently combined with the exchanges not being opened OR when they are opened they are slow and lagging, it is nice to read some insights into what is actually happening.

"They have chosen to use BitPay as their payment processor. The EFF can utilize BitPay’s ability convert directly to USD without having to worry about fluctuations in exchange rates." EFF is only holding fiat currency, not BTC.

This article contains a lot of good content. Overall, I think less regulation is better, but IMO, well-defined regulation is a better outcome than the uncertainty of future regulation.

This article provides great insight into Avalon's product delivery schedule. Does Avalon have a good track record of meeting schedule and delivery dates? Is this schedule going to be met or are we looking at a Butterfly Labs perpetual 2-week lead time??

This is a screenshot from [The Genesis Block]( The ad for Western Union's "Great Value" of $10/transaction is shown adjacent to an article on Bitcoin about it having low to no fees.

I don't know if you can make such a broad statement of "both currencies will fail, as there is not a large enough market and enough VC money to support two." There are [182 currencies]( in the world existing in the world today. I don't think adding two more currencies will over-saturate the market. And the amount of VC money available is completely unknown; it has increased dramatically recently and that trend will most likely continue. Not to mention, litecoins is a copy of the bitcoin protocol, so all of the existing infrastructure for bitcoins could theoretically work with litecoin with minimal coding. This is not an endorsement of litecoin by any means, but I don't think the acceptance and proliferation of digital currencies is a binary outcome where one currency wins or none of them wins.
