I bought more at 11k and will continue to buy at whatever rate I can. Currently stuck behind Coinbase weekly purchase limits. 
I’m trying to put another 30-50k in. 
As soon as they clear I put them in my hardware wallet and put them in my home safe.
I’m holding them like physical gold until they eventually normalize.

Yes I am, just curious about who he is because I see so many posts. Gonna try and catch a YouTube clip.

Without going into my specific situation just from an anonymity aspect, college and a lot of it. 
Grad school either law or medicine is a ticket to the 1% if you work hard during either. 
I grew up on welfare (spouse and I both did) and by 35 we’ve paid off all student loans, own a million dollar home and have 400k income combined. 
Currently investing 100k of that a year.

I knew before I did it. I did it because I wanted the guy to be able to eat. I’m just trying to figure out how sending $50 costs $50 since this is my first small transaction, I wasn’t aware that the fees could be this high. 
In the past I’ve only purchased whole coins so I didn’t really take the $50 into consideration. 
So if any transaction no matter how small going to cost that much?

I’ve been saying the last week we are on the cusp of huge shifts. I don’t think it’s gonna be like 17.5 today and 18.2 tomorrow. 
I’m anticipating jumps like 22 and then immediately to 28 - 35 etc and I believe this is going happen rapidly until we eventually stabilize around 100k where I don’t think we’ll see a lot of fluctuations. 
I think this was all inevitable, and was anticipated to happen in 2020. A lot more people became aware and wanna be part of the ride which has really accelerated this timeline. 
The 2020 100k bitcoin is going to be way way sooner.

It’s not the scene, it’s just not a movie you remake - unless Wilder is playing Wonka. 
Imagine a beetlejuice reboot with Depp - he’s the only guy I can imagine doing it, but it’s still gonna suck.

I keep hearing about this guy. 
Anyone have a paragraph on what his involvement is in bitcoin?

Not only do they get away with it, we bailed them out with tax dollars to pay for their crimes and as a final slap to our faces they used that money to pay their CEOs hundreds of millions in bonuses that year. 
Eric Holder refused to prosecute anyone, he was handpicked by Wall Street big wigs for Obama..

Mine isn’t bitcoin, but I went from welfare to the 1% and I remember always wanting a corvette. I bought it, sold it a few months later and realized now that I can buy any car in the lot, I don’t even care. 
It’s like you stop having the desire to obtain things when they are obtainable. 
Now I do spend money on fancy vacations.

I don’t care if I lose my whole “investment” this was always a risky one, which I’ve made plenty of in the past and lost on those too. Doesn’t effect my safe investments, so I’m moon or bust.

My goal is 100k, if it eventually leveled out for a long time 5-7 years, I’ll cash out. Right own I own exactly 1 bitcoin, but might add to that. I don’t invest in anything risky, except this. This is my 1 risky bet, and I’m willing to roll the dice. 
Bitcoins are less than 10% of my current holdings. You need a little risk, I did well last year (27%) but that was all very low risk mutual funds etc, so this is my gamble.

I bought in at $9500. If it crashes I’m buying a fuckton more.

I bought the ledger nano hardware wallet. 
That’s the way to go, buy from whoever then immediately put it in your own wallet.

It all depends on what your definition of luxury is. 
We stayed in 5-star resorts and ate wagyu beef a bunch. We spent about 5k for the week, not including first class flights which were around $6500.

I’ve been saying for the last few days I think we are the point of seeing jumps significantly higher. 
It’s not gonna be $19100, it’s going to be $23000 and then $30000 and so on. 
I am anticipating huge jumps.

I didn’t know how else to do it, and I was sending money to that poor starving guy in Venezuela who did the AMA - so I ate the fees so he could get the money. 
Just trying to figure out if there is a better way.

It’s like insider trading except with cryptocurrency nobody can be held accountable. 
Expect things like this to happen and insiders to get rich every time.
