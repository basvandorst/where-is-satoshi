It depends if you think that Wall Street traders are complete morons. I happen to think that to be a trader trading millions of $ of other peoples money, they probably require a modicum of risk analysis, and won't buy on the downside of a bubble.
They also may think that shorting Bitcoin is a better idea than going long.

How it's meant to work:
You buy Tether (USDT) from the Tether company, then they keep your dollars in their bank account and give you Tether tokens, which you can then trade for other coins. This effectively allows you to trade in pseudo-USD, which should be worth a real USD. You should be able to reclaim your real USD for a Tether.
The worry is:
1. Tether claim that they are getting billions of dollars from "institutional investors" buying Tether coins. However this seems unlikely, as it's such a ridiculous investment for anyone with a serious amount of money. Would you put millions into a company that banks won't touch? If you're a big investor, why not just buy Bitcoins directly, rather than buy Tether, then Bitcoins. Tether is mean to be 1:1 with $, so you won't make any money just buying Tether.
2. This leads to the worry that in fact these Tethers aren't backed, and are just being printed out of thin air.
3. These Tether coins are used to buy other crypto coins, which inflates the prices.
4. Because people think that 1USDT=1$ (and exchanges don't make the difference very clear), arbitrage bots will average out the prices from various exchanges, so the real $ price of coins is also inflated.
5. Tether in their terms say they don't have to give you your dollars back in exchange for Tether. If Tether are worth a lot less than $1, as is suspected, then you won't be able to trade your BTC for real USD at anywhere near the current prices. This will mean a collapse in BTC prices.
6. Tether and Bitfinex are owned by the same people. Bitfinex were hacked and lost a lot of money. They could be trying to trade their way back to solvency using Tether.
There are actually a multitude of scams that could be going on. Pumping and dumping, using arbitrage to get real $ in exchange for Tether, etc etc.
@_date: 2018-01-23 18:19:51
If most people bought it at below $2000 and hold on to them, it leaves a much smaller floating supply of coins to be traded. This smaller floating supply can be traded up to $10000, but the amount of money in the system is far lower than $10000 per coin, but much nearer $2000.
@_date: 2018-01-13 14:13:27
The rapid price increases in December were due to the masses getting involved. There isn't a single Bitcoin investor that is doing it without the hope of making money.
If you sell 50% now, then even if the other 50% drops to much lower levels you'll have a guaranteed profit. Massive rises like we've seen recently are unlikely, and a big drop is a possible scenario.
@_date: 2018-01-10 16:58:51
Yes, that is what Bitcoin is at the moment (well, that mania phase happened in December). However, that doesn't mean it doesn't have a long term future, merely that it is probably way over-priced.
People on here don't like the term bubble because a lot have bought it at too high a price. But those that are just interested in the technology and philosophy behind it all shouldn't be concerned. It's more promising to have a bubble because it at least shows there is demand, even if it ends up in greed and panic followed by a correction.
@_date: 2018-01-12 22:13:35
1. Buying something at such a high price is incredibly reckless. If you traded like some on here in a bank you'd be sacked instantly.
2. Banking regulation was working pretty well until most of it was removed in the 80/90s.
None of this matters as you'd still have banking in a bitcoin economy.
@_date: 2018-01-14 14:17:09
Because almost everyone here is long, and expressing wishful thinking.
There is no fundamental reason it should increase in price.

He's probably make some money as other speculators would see the big rises and think "it only ever goes up" or "fast rises will continue". If he's smart he'll end up selling to these people, and they will make a loss.
These same people are the ones that are long on Bitcoin right now - attracted in by fast price rises. They will probably lose a lot of money.
@_date: 2018-01-21 06:53:48
500 million in investment in the last week?
There is literally no point in buying tethers as an investor, as they are supposed to stay pegged to the dollar. What sort of big financial institution would buy that much Tether.
This is seriously worrying. Get your money off the exchanges as this could be mtgox 2, but worse.
@_date: 2018-01-30 18:12:21
It's finally happened.
@_date: 2018-01-29 17:53:12
Exactly, why indeed?
Tether is useful for exchanges who have been frozen out of their bank accounts, and/or if they've been hacked and need liquidity. The last thing any serious investor would want to do is expose themselves to an unregulated exchange.
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:06:49
Volume high, spread high on the downbar = lots of selling.
Volume low on the up bar - not many are interested in the up move.

This is spot on. If you buy bitcoin you are hoping that someone will be willing to buy it off you for a much higher price. It's all zero sum in Bitcoin, not everyone can become rich. For every Bitcoin billionaire, a billion $ has to be lost by other people.
It's happened once already, in that we've had a public mania of people buying Bitcoin. Is it likely to happen again?
@_date: 2018-01-25 14:00:37

No. It's under pressure because of the greed of all the people buying in at ever higher prices.
@_date: 2018-01-13 23:06:36
Imagine you change the scenario, so instead of talking about BTC you are buying and selling:
a) a pen
b) a car
The point is that in case a) someone has ended up spending 14,000$ on an almost worthless pen, and in case b) someone has sold an expensive car for 100$. There are always going to be losers, no matter what the intrinsic value of the thing being traded.
Bitcoin growing is very different to AAPL growing. 1 BTC isn't really that different in 2010 compared to 2018. AAPL at the start was a guy working in his garage, and it now has huge numbers of employees, offices and shops around the world. Just the amount of land owned alone will be thousands of times higher. And the most crucial thing is it returns a dividend to the shareholders. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 17:31:22
The lack of new investors is a worrying thing. You need people willing to buy it at higher prices, else it won't go up.
It's not like Herbalife, which is a pyramid scam. However bubbles and pyramid scams both fail for the same reason - lack of new entrants due to population constraints.

Bitcoin won't get rid of banks. The world relies on lending and credit. Entities would still have to lend Bitcoin.
The banks were reckless in the lead up to 2008, creating a credit bubble. However not nearly as reckless as those on here putting large amounts into Bitcoin.
This is why you need strong regulation, rather than zero regulation. People are irrational and without regulation greed and instability will be the end result.
@_date: 2018-01-13 16:41:28
Huh? Market cap is almost entirely reliant on the price (and the rest being the extra coin generated). It is most definitely zero sum. Everyone can't become rich through Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-23 13:15:04
They're invested and are hoping desperately for it to go up. They hope that if everyone believes this, they'll keep buying and not sell.
@_date: 2018-01-09 11:37:19
It's hilarious that people think that professional traders are going to go out and buy something that's likely over-valued. Maybe a small punt, but their whole bonus?
@_date: 2018-01-10 14:53:15
Simply a lack of buyers willing to pay the current price. The only reason people bought at stupidly high levels was because the price was shooting upwards and it was all over the news.
It's easy when trading to think that there is some mysterious force behind it all, but the reality is it's just the thought processes of lots of people. Yes there can be some market manipulation, but in the whole it's just the mass judgement of people, which isn't always that rational (see the work done by Nobel Prize winner Daniel Kahneman).
@_date: 2018-01-14 19:41:42
That's really tragic and upsetting. These are the sort of people that buy at the top - the uniformed public. It's ok if it's a small amount, but when it's their entire savings you've got to feel for them.
Also, having to pay interest on a loan has nothing to do with Bitcoin, and wouldn't change.
@_date: 2018-01-10 16:11:21
That has nothing to do with a speculative bubble. No one bought an iphone hoping that they could sell it on for a massive profit in 6 months time.

Wait a few months and you'll be able to buy lots.
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:05:36
People tend to have a direction that they believe the price will go in. They are then tempted in once it starts going the direction they think it will go. If there are lots of buyers, then there is a medium-high volume. If there aren't lots of buyers then the price doesn't sustain itself, and the volume is low.
You can use this to see what the market sentiment is.
@_date: 2018-01-21 16:14:46
A very good question. Realistically an economy based on Bitcoin cannot function unless there was another token representing value that could be loaned out.
If you just had banks or even groups of people lending out their own Bitcoins then the economy would collapse due to a lack of credit.
@_date: 2018-01-21 22:47:27

97% of economists asked said it was a bubble. Lots of people got suckered in at that price due to the Bitcoin media mania, so you're in good company.
Like all trading, you either take a loss now, or sit and hope the price recovers. This may take a long time, or never happen.
Before you make a trade, you must have 3 things:
1) A reason to enter the trade
2) A plan if it goes wrong
3) A plan if it goes right
If you don't have these three things you're just gambling, and likely to lose long term.

The first 3 have made money ($), not the 4th. You're also missing the person that no1 bought from. If the BTC is worthless then no.4 is now left at -14,000$. If the BTC was actually worth 14,000$ then the person before no.1 has sold a 14,000$ BTC for 100$, reducing his wealth by 13,900$.
You'll be thinking "but it cost very little for the original person to create so he hasn't lost money". I'd agree with that, but that means that the real valuation of a BTC is near zero.
You might also be thinking about Apple shares growth, but companies actually produce things and do economic work, hence the increase in their wealth. 
You can't just magic wealth by creating new currency (see hyperinflation), and you can't create it by buying and selling amongst yourselves. You can create wealth by other economic activities though, for example producing goods.
@_date: 2018-01-15 20:04:19

There is over-valued, and then there is a bubble. A bubble is where every man and his dog jumps in and irrationally buys something because of fear of missing out, with no thought as to the risks involved.
Currencies like the $ are generally influenced by interest rates, inflation and the strength of the underlying economy of that country.
Bitcoin is almost impossible to value as a currency, but the recent high prices are purely down to the general public buying it out of greed.
@_date: 2018-01-29 18:11:08

It's down to human behaviour. They don't always follow that curve precisely. Basically:
1. There is a slow but steady rise. This attracts a few investors in.
2. This starts to accelerate the price, which attracts more in. It's a feedback loop.
3. Eventually the news media start reporting on big rises. This attracts the general public and causes a skyrocket in price.
4. Because the price is now so high, sensible investors are no longer interested, and the only price rises are coming from the general public.
5. The top comes once the general public stop buying, because they're all already all in (by all, those that would likely invest). There is now not enough money coming in to support the high price. This is price exhaustion.
6. The price plummets as sensible investors get out early.
7. A few plucky souls attempt to buy the dip, but because the general public aren't able to buy as they've spent all the money they're willing to invest already, it's not sustainable.
8. The more sensible types sell early, but lots are now locked in and refuse to sell until the price is very low. No one is interested in buying.
9. Only a very low price do the public sell. You see this in so many stock charts
10. This is where the professionals buy - the selling climax.
There is actually some science behind this, and it's to do with the fact that humans act irrationally. A main factor in the way markets and bubbles work is: 
Loss aversion is why you get steady rises then fast falls in stock prices.
@_date: 2018-01-11 18:54:13
Everyone on here is talking about buying the dip, if they are going to buy. That might halt the down movement, but what they need is people to buy it at 15-20k. They're not willing to do it, but are hoping that others will. That requires the same rush of new people as happened in December, when it was all over the news, to happen again. I'd say it was unlikely, but I could be wrong...
I think there are many on here stuck in awful positions, desperate for the price to rise.
@_date: 2018-01-29 11:43:49
Haha, no I've never bought any Bitcoin. I've done some spread bet trades, so not on the actual market, but in tiny amounts due to the high risk, and mostly (but not all) on the short side.
I know people are excited give the unprecedented rises, but it cannot continue.
@_date: 2018-01-16 16:34:52
Yesterday the price rose then fell on low volume - this is an excellent sign that no buyers are interested in the upside.
If there were lots interested in buying then the volume would be higher, and the rise probably sustained.

It's all about the risks though. Something that hasn't really changed, but is now priced 10x what it was a year ago.
No professional would buy an AAPL share if it was priced 10x more than a year ago, as there is no sensible justification for such a high price (the company can't grow that fast).

@_date: 2018-01-14 14:35:17
1) A sign of strength in the charts, or a fundamental reason (e.g. a good company at a low historical price). I'm typically a share trader. I look for a low price, and a lot of buying (high volume) in the background. I want the professionals to be buying, and the general public selling. This tends to happen after a long downtrend, followed by a big drop in price.
2) This tends to be a stop loss, which then gives you a defined risk. If you're just holding, then your stop loss is zero, which means you're risking the entire amount you traded. No stop loss isn't always a bad strategy, as long as you're only risking small amounts of capital.
3) For me, this would be either a strong resistance level, or when I start to see weakness in the chart. Any acceleration upwards, or huge amounts of volume coming in means I'm likely to look to take profit.
I trade by trying to buy low, and sell high. With shares I've been pretty successful. I'm interested in Bitcoin at the moment because it's the first bubble I've witnessed live, and it's the biggest in history in % terms.
Once I saw "massive Bitcoin price rises" on the front page of The Times, I thought it was likely that the writing was on the wall for Bitcoin in the short and medium term. Why - because this is what draws the general public in, and when the professional traders dump their holdings.
 It may recover years from now. Of course, I may be wrong and it recovers a lot sooner.
@_date: 2018-01-10 09:32:48
Professional traders aren't going to buy Bitcoin at a stupidly high price in large quantities. They are professionals for a reason - they have to be very disciplined. Gambling your entire bonus on Bitcoin at a high price is the antithesis of what they do for a living. If it crashes to below $1000 then the reward:risk ratio becomes a lot more favourable. It's all about risk vs reward, something no one seems to mention on here.

@_date: 2018-01-10 16:27:54
If it were a company producing a product that was solving these problems and at the same time generating a profit then this would be something investable in. But with Bitcoin people are effectively investing in the value of the product, not the company making returns.
E.g. Paypal was a fantastic invention allowing internet money transfers. However you wouldn't expect the currencies themselves to increase in value because they could now be transferred more easily. I'd invest in paypal, but I wouldn't start buying US dollars despite the fact they are now far more useful as a currency.
This is where valuing Bitcoin is incredibly difficult. It doesn't make any return. Any increase in value is entirely reliant on new people coming in and buying it at ever higher prices. It's zero sum, and the early buyers are the winners, but I think it's too late and too risky now.
@_date: 2018-01-15 19:51:28

He makes some very good points:
1. Blockchain is a potentially useful technology. However it is available for free on the internet.
2. When you buy Bitcoin you're not investing in anything.
3. Nothing becomes a good investment just because “it’s been going up in price lately”.
4. And most importantly - When the supply of foolish speculators dries up the value evaporates – often very quickly. 
Anyone buying Bitcoin has to understand these points.

But you're hoping it increases in value (to spend on other things, even if you don't plan to convert it back to $), otherwise there's not a lot of point in keeping it.
Any trading is done with the hope that something will increase in value. The problem is always that you have to hope that someone in the future thinks it's more valuable than it is now.

There's a whole load more information out there, it's all quite interesting. 
This could all be cleared up if Tether and Bitfinex were to be professionally audited, so that accountants could verify the bank holdings they claim to have. However the auditor they tried to get to audit them has "severed ties" with them, and removed all mention of them on their website.
I'd just be cautious and not expose myself to Tether. If you have Bitcoin and think it will be worth a lot more one day, then keep it, preferably off an exchange so it doesn't get hacked.

We're probably somewhere to the right of the top peak.
The public buying has been fairly obvious, with bitcoin mentioned on the news and the front pages of newspapers, creating the mania. All the "dumb" money bought in above $10k, and there isn't enough left to keep the price up.
@_date: 2018-01-14 15:26:18

There isn't anyone left to buy it. I've been in rooms recently where almost everyone has invested in it. Maybe once it falls a lot then there will be lots of professional investors getting involved, but as far as the general public goes, they've already been suckered in.
@_date: 2017-12-31 13:23:20
Hence the bubble. I've witnessed the same, large numbers of the general public getting involved. This drives the price up massively, but when there is no-one left it plummets.

Fast price rise after a steady rise always sucker people in. Look at any stocks or currency chart.

That isn't really important, it's those that have money and would want to invest. The new buyers have to come from somewhere, and they need available money to invest. For prices to rise then people have to be buying it up at those levels. 
It's a bubble. That doesn't mean it won't eventually take over from fiat currencies, but right now it has been pushed up in price by pure speculation, which can only take it so far. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 09:08:18
Bitcoin isn't a Ponzi scheme, but the current bubble will pop for the same reason a ponzi scheme eventually fails - lack of public to buy in, because the gullible have already all bought in too late.
Stocks aren't Ponzi schemes. You own a bit of a company, which has real assets and make a return if the company is profitable. You can buy them at too high a price, which is what the general public tend to do, in the same way that the majority have bought bitcoin at far too high a price.

@_date: 2017-12-30 22:20:33
Spot on. The bubble collapses once the general public are drawn in, and there is now no one left to keep buying. No one on here would buy Bitcoin at $20k, yet they expect that there are those out there that will.
There is a real smack of desperation here.

Serious investors like Warren Buffett wouldn't have bought in late December 2017, even if they thought that it had merit.
Anyone who knew anything about economics and/or trading was selling, short selling or avoiding Bitcoin in Dec 2017.

I'm shocked that you say you're not a financial advisor, given your outstanding advice.

Shorted it a few times as it was an obvious bubble. Made a nice 4 figure sum so far. Not in at the moment, but might re-enter the short if it goes above 8.5k again, depending on how it looks.
As a trader I was actually more interested in just watching the reactions of the dumb money, which this sub is perfect for. I thought I may as well short it in a small amount for fun (but with only small amounts).

Market cap is defined here as price x number of coins.
It isn't the amount of money that has flowed into Bitcoin, which will be considerably lower. 2 billion is quite a lot.

I think it was worked out at about $6billion 2 months ago, with a similar price as today.

The claim is that they have been used when Bitcoin is in a crash to reverse it. You need to look for events where the market is going down strongly, Tether prints, then the price reverses.
I'm not sure whether it's true or not. Even if Tether isn't used this way, there's plenty of pump and dump going on in crypto.

They made the currency deflationary and asset like. Bitcoin will never work unless radical changes are made, but these changes are at the core of the philosophy.
In certain fairly unique circumstance having a decentralised currency is a good idea. But for most situations and most people it is a terrible idea. There are far more cons than pros.

Sadly the inventors of Bitcoin knew a lot about computer programming, but nothing about economics.

Sensible decision.

No you're not.

How is gambling on crypto better than gambling on stocks? At least stock give you a return.

It didn't work very well.

How do you get free education without taxes?

Just what I was thinking. The alleged Tether pumps only happened fairly rarely, mostly when the price was dropping. To ignore these is pointless, as these are the events that should be being studied
