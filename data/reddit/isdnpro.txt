I'd put good money on MtGOX having lost money as a result of this.
Their press release specifically talks about educating support staff to be aware of the issue - I wouldn't be surprised if their support team had been duped into redepositing BTC when the original deposit's txid was modified.
Also as others point out, Bitstamp specifically assured users no money was lost - on the other hand, MtGox has issued no such assurance and has also refused to prove solvency, despite being happy to do so in the past.
I think the writing is on the wall, and I'd get my BTC out (... if I could.)

We could do all that with MtGox wallet addresses, which I believe we have (some?) of.


Not sure what you mean by this, if they are just sending transactions though there'd be no way to differentiate if it was a withdrawl or some other type of transaction (can't think of any other reasons for BTC to be leaving Gox, except shuffling between wallets).
Worth noting that if the funds were indeed stolen by tx malleability, all of the bitcoins were 'withdrawn' - just many, many times when the users accounts really didn't have any BTC left in it.
@_date: 2014-02-25 08:43:47
Not 100% sure, it depends on how incompetent they were handling their hot wallet.
It really doesn't sounds like their accounting was up to scratch... if that's the case, they could have been filling the hot wallet daily from cold (I've seen this speculated) and not realised their cold wallet balances were running dangerously low.
That sounds stupid, I know, but this whole Gox thing is like one big sick joke so it wouldn't shock me if that was spot on.

Right fair enough, sorry I've been posting this in a lot of threads since very few people seemed to have came to the same conclusion.
I have no good answer as to how they managed to lose so many coins, though there's no real proof they've lost 750, 000, it could be much less but still enough to be insolvent.
Based on how poorly run the company seems to be, I can only assume they weren't reconciling against the blockchain or using balances from it. They may have been calculating their balance based off their own internal transaction tables, in which case they'd never see the multiplied transactions they sent.

From the IRC log it sounded like the images were in the database (probably as binary blobs)
@_date: 2014-02-26 07:11:15
This 100% is spot on.
And the reason they auto reissue and use different inputs is because Gox weren't tracking the age of inputs and were trying to spend immature inputs.
Their "fix" was to just reissue transactions over and over again with a different set of inputs until they eventually created a valid transaction.
Of course, this bit them in the ass in the long run. Hard.

I've never come across any, can you share?
@_date: 2014-02-25 15:13:30


I think you're missing the point.
You want the client to send a hashed password, right? For security.
Big scary hacker comes along and does a man in the middle attack - originally, he would have gotten the plain text. Now, he gets the hashed version instead.
... and sends it to the server, to which the server says "Yep cool, that's the hash I wanted" - much the same as if they had the plaintext.
There are ways you could try to stop that (like adding a salt to your hash), but it's a lot of extra effort to be no more secure (if not less secure) than sending the plaintext via POST via HTTPS (so not in plain text to an attacker anyway).
Edit: 


Re-reading that quote, I should also clarify (particularly for others reading) - the server will have your password stored as a hash anyway, so when you send your plain-text password to login, it is hashed and compared. If you were to send the same hash to the server, the server may as well just store passwords in plain text since if somebody got a hold of that hash, they could login. As it stands, a database of hashed passwords is pretty useless (if they were salted).

Well I assume your desire is for a user to be able to take their email address, hash it (SHA) and be able to determine their UUID.
If the 'email hash' contains the UUID, then the user would have to calculate their 'email hash' with every single possible UUID, which is about 189 thousand.
It takes my machine about 15 seconds to calculate 10, 000 hashes using sha256sum, so it would take almost 5 minutes to crunch every row in the database to try and determine which 'email hash' belongs to you.

They are, they're also one of the biggest ripoffs around.
I got a letter in the mail the other day letting me know my account balance of my prepaid travel card was now $0, as the $50 balance I'd left on it from my previous travel had been whittled away by $4 a month ("inactive account fee"). My fault entirely, but I do love the fact they waited until every sent was gone before sending me an account statement.

There is an IRC log posted in the daily discussion thread with this quote:


It sounds like MagicalTux is confirming MtGox automatically resent deposits if the initial transaction had it's ID manipulated - if that's the case, the amount of Bitcoin lost by Gox could be quite substantial, since anybody exploiting the flaw could simply do withdrawls and deposits over and over until one 'suceeds', their funds are doubled without any human intervention.
Other exchanges (i.e. Bitstamp) have come out and explicitly said they haven't lost any funds - Gox have NOT, and have also refused to prove solvency despite having done so in the past. I think it's quite clear Gox is short on coins and is buying time, else they would fix their wallet as other exchanges have done instead of passing the buck.
@_date: 2014-03-09 17:36:29
Not sure how these users are confirming since the mtgox_balances file uses GUIDs to identify users and as far as I can see, there's no file included that ties usernames to user GUIDs?
It is late though so I'm probably missing something.

I don't really see any problem with that TBH, it's a perfectly acceptable way to store data.
It's not like it made any difference to how much they could score from this hack, they got the database, they got some source code, they could've just as easily pulled down a bunch of passport images stored on the filesystem - having them in the database would make it marginally less work, but either way Gox were fucked.
Edit: This is copping some downvotes, which I don't mind, but as a developer I'm interested - is it considered bad practice to store binary blobs in a database? I thankfully haven't had to make the decision in the past, but I'd probably incline towards doing so to avoid a messy file system. Curious if this is wrong.

CSVs are definitely legit, confirmed my balance

Your ID is in the first email you receive from Gox, as part of the verification URL.
My balance was correct and I only moved BTC into Gox in Jan this year, so it seems pretty up to date.

Transaction malleability.
Their wallet solution was coded so if a transaction failed (based on the txID), it would be resent - main reason for this implementation was seemingly because MtGox would try to spend 'immature' inputs (not included in enough blocks), causing transactions to fail. Hence, auto resend.
The real problem was once the network was being DDoSed and every transaction was having malleability applied, they would have automatically resent a HEAP of coin.

That's false hope and a half, I don't think a single coin the US gov has seized has ever been returned to it's rightful owner

Somebody is 'chasing' BTC through the block chain - i.e. the person who stole them is tumbling them, but the person 'chasing' has managed to follow every step, and thus knows the final address they ended up at.
I just realised your post never mentioned tumbling - short version, you send in 1 BTC from an address, you get 1 BTC back (or more accurately, fractions totalling 1 BTC back) but the coins you receive will not have originated from your wallet. Google 'tumbling bitcoin' for more.

Maybe Mark has [already tried]( - links to 9gag (and NOTES that it's a 9gag link), says he cannot provide proof of solvency due to legal issues, and so on.
I'm putting my GOXBTC on Mark being gagged, especially after how defeated he looked in today's meeting. That does not look like a man who is weeks away from retiring on billions.

Pretty much everyone I've spoken to in person has pronounced it "Mount Gox", since "Mt" and "Mount" are synonymous in English so even people who don't know the original Mtgox acronynm tend to pronounce it "Mount Gox" instead of M.T.G.O.X.

Agreed, that is a huge red flag for a country.

With the difference being one virus would be targetting 100% of vulnerable users, 99% of whom would have no idea how to check each connection leaving their machine (let alone determing if it's suspicious), versus targeting MAYBE 0.001% of potentally vulnerable users because if they don't have the blockchain locally, forget it.

True enough, sorry if my comment was snarky at all I'm just a bit over this week :)

It's worth noting this ISP appears to be a "one man band" outfit (the phone number provided is a mobile number, and throughout the text there is "me", "I", etc.) - not that there's necessarily anything wrong with that, but it's by no means a known ISP and you should be wary if you are going to sign up.
Particularly since they sell their plans as Unlimited - this simply isn't sustainable in AU at these speeds, even if the NBN was rolled out the major cost for providers is international backhaul, which makes it far too expensive to sell unlimited (even unlimited ADSL2 is only recent-ish in Australia, and even then there are usually AUPs making it limited).
Finally, if you check the plan info page, all of the plans have a "committed information rate" of 100 kbit(!). In other words, if their network is saturated (which can EASILY happen with only a dozen or so heavy-hitters on 100 mbit plans), you might as well get out a couple of 56K modems because you'll be on-par.
(Overall I still think it is neat to see, and particularly cool that the NBN would have allowed startups like this, but it is very idealistic unfortunately)

Seriously? One battery explodes and it's an epidemic?
ANY lithium battery is a risk for explosion, especially if mistreated or a faulty charging circuit. There's been one S4 explode - search exploding iPhone and there's pages of em.

How hard would it be to build something like this for Android? (Or does something already exist?)
I'd love an open source version... interested in both platforms :)

Yep commenting here to play with it later :)

So uh, according to the pastebin ( this post is referring to... the attack is scheduled to start at 22-04-2013 at 15:30 UTC.
At the moment it is 12:38 UTC, so we have 3 hours to go before it even begins... (assuming it does. Regardless, this post has jumped the shark)

That's really not true... you can apply online yes but I'm pretty sure you need proof of ID, and the info is posted out to the address you apply with as well.

Yeah, reading the comments on that page is hilarious, they all think Bitcoin is some website.
They'd be about 10-12, I remember watching BTN in primary school ~10 years ago, can't believe it's still on.

Hi olaf,
When is it going to be possible for merchants outside the US to make use of Coinbase? According to [this page]( support for other countries was slated for early 2013, but it looks like this has been and gone?
I'd be very interested in using you from Australia, but it doesn't seem this is possible right now.
@_date: 2013-04-22 15:49:10
Yeah my bad, I knew as soon as I wrote it I'd used it wrong :P

I don't understand this... from what I can see in the discussion, everything was very civil?
@_date: 2013-09-10 17:16:00
There is a space there though?

Fuck that. It doesn't cost $10, 000 to develop Bitcoin integration, especially with things like BitPay now.
For 10 grand you could easily start a competitor!

Ahh true, I almost went with that but felt I'd look pedantic...guess it is too late for that anyway though, I've updated my post since it hurts me to look at in it's current format heh
