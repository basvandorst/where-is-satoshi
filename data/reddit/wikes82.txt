will be interesting to see how this plays out, right now bitcoin cash 82% more profitable to mine than BTC, I'm watching the hash rate on both chains.
@_date: 2017-08-14 18:33:11
Yup, It has been a while they integrated bitcoin

Seeing things like this scares me, that bitcoin price just a bubble, everyone hoarding bitcoins instead of using them.
There is no way Bitcoin being use for payment &gt; than Paypal.

Stripe integrated with Bitcoin, but I haven't seen any merchant using Stripe accepting Bitcoin.
If only Lyft and Uber accepting Bitcoin through Stripe, it will be awesome (they are currently using Stripe with CC only). Right now, I have to convert Bitcoin to Uber Gift Card using egifter or gyft.com to use it.
The point is, integration doesn't mean adoption. PayPal could integrate bitcoin, but people still using CC and ACH for funding.

Big block centralized, you can say the same for Lightning Network
@_date: 2017-08-11 03:27:23
Segwit locked in, but not activated yet.. according to xbt.eu
around 1796 blocks more to activate ATM.

I like to show friends or relatives to watch this video of how blockchain works, very easy to understand for non techie

2nd+ layer also would lead to centralized system and government regulated. Any transactions on 2nd Layer would be centralized and authority can regulate it (reversals, tracking,etc).
@_date: 2017-07-08 18:07:21
IMHO, whichever fork has Segwit + LN will reach $55k first ;-)
@_date: 2017-07-25 19:17:15
weak hands panic sell all your coins now
@_date: 2017-07-20 03:10:50
Fork is happening anyway with Bitcoin Cash.
Also PoW change with memory hard algo, bad actors can't come back with their existing ASIC miners.

Am I the only one here who doesn't want BIP91 lock in, and expecting hard fork and PoW change ? IMHO, its the best for bitcoin core future
@_date: 2017-07-01 02:16:39
it won't cause entire collapse of the system, there has been talks about changing PoW

those who downvoted me, wait until Jihan doing 51% attack on SegWit
@_date: 2017-07-22 17:48:53
they're still around... and bitcoin won't kill them anytime soon. People buying bitcoin as digital gold, not money transfer
@_date: 2017-07-23 03:05:19

@_date: 2017-07-19 14:40:56
I want Jihan and Roger mine on their own chain and leave us alone once and for all.

Try using Private Browsing in firefox or Incognito in Chrome

why not use

I got it... left 0.00007
@_date: 2013-02-19 03:08:11
address generated by the private key... so, the answer is no... you don't need the address
@_date: 2013-04-12 20:27:26
From what happen in the past it always bounced back... 
but the problem is, I can't buy ... 
Only way I could buy now is by using Coinbase, but I will get the price when the transaction clear
@_date: 2013-02-17 19:02:53
pissed me off... tried to buy, and got the 
"Sorry, the maximum number of purchases on Coinbase has been reached for today. Please try again in 24 hours. We'll continue raising this limit over time."
@_date: 2013-03-07 02:53:37
Now that the price back up to $44, can't imagine how people who sold when it was $33 feel right now...
@_date: 2013-02-19 02:48:26
typed this in my bash shell... then imported the result to blockchain.info

@_date: 2013-04-02 01:02:50
Instead  of doing that, why can't they do something like other exchanges, with preloaded fund... basically you transfer your USD to your account, then whenever you want to buy BTC just use that fund to buy instantly.
@_date: 2013-10-14 15:18:34
can we do it sometime on the weekend?
@_date: 2013-03-04 03:33:19
that's a valid bitcoin address, but there is no way to generate private key for that address... basically someone just created 1BitcoinEaterAddressDontSend and added the checksum at the end
@_date: 2013-03-11 22:31:21
thanks... it's the meaning of life
@_date: 2013-06-04 19:27:18
it's actually a good deal, compare to paying the regular price of $280
@_date: 2013-03-04 05:00:28
this one another blackhole with almost 3BTC in it
the private key for the address is impossible to generate cause the hash would be all zeros.
@_date: 2013-03-19 15:28:57
I hate it when it's volatile like this... can't use it for transaction... 
@_date: 2013-03-20 02:57:00
there is a way actually...but not easy to do, by double spending with transaction fee... 
@_date: 2013-06-04 19:28:01
Where can I pre-order?
