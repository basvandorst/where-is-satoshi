If it breaks I feel like it’ll 100% be a v reversal combined with roller coaster gifs all over crypto subreddits lol

A lot of the weak hands are out and traders and bots are only gonna push it so much lower; closer we get to around 5k less and less will sell.  We’ll see a little dip after the 30th and maybe see one long red candle but that’s about as far as I see it going.  Of the Mt. Gox btc that gets released I only see about 25% of being sold, the rest will be a split of hodl and alt coin acquisition pushing an alt run in q1.

 I’m exploring options, I need a good bank that’s in both the southeast and northeast United States that allows it

Bitcoin volatility is at a 14 month low, just chill and watch.  We’ll probably hit close to 5k or right below at lowest.  9 etf’s got rejected and the market held to the point of liquidating all the shorts.  Read the market sentiment.

it's been in a falling wedge, there was no chance of a breakout until a retracement happened.  It'll start it's new cycle within the next couple weeks.
@_date: 2018-05-21 04:53:51
As an entry point for right now with s9’s at a reasonable price, you could put together a decent farm with 20-30k easily.  With 40 of them you’d gross about $250-$300 per day, and electricity would run $100-$190 per day.  If f you have less than 4k to work with, you can’t even build a decent gpu rig that will scale it’s power with the market growth; just buy coins and trade/hold in that case.

Think $.08 per, forgot to factor that in lol.  650 day roi, good thing he’s probably not selling anything for 2 years.  It’ll probably be sooner since I’m using em for a prohashing conversion and not mining straight bitcoin.

As an American this made me laugh because modern American politics are a joke.  It’s literally as you said, two groups deciding what they like, only the media sells different narratives to different demographics to have us constantly at edge with each other.

This is pretty awesome.  I’ve read into the history a lot but I missed(maybe just don’t remember) a good bit that’s in this.  It’s a nice refresh.

What’d you recommend for fan speed?
@_date: 2018-07-11 21:02:10
105 is the cutoff, 90-92 is borderline.  Went ahead and took the filters off the front and got them down to 70s and 80s, too much air constriction.
@_date: 2018-07-07 03:27:59
Especially with media saying it’s a good buy sub 5k, that pretty much seals it.
@_date: 2018-07-07 03:25:19
Right?!  I wouldn’t even do this with a the knowledge to prevent all electronic theft, people can still find you and force things out of you

Appreciate the help!  But I thought about that, had to prioritize sound dissipation.  Their neighbor’s bedroom about 15 feet away from the window we’re using for exhaust.  Put 2 panels of sound insulation in the window as well.  Can barely hear em outside now.

Simple yet elegant description
@_date: 2019-05-23 05:02:41
“In a case in which a work is registered under a pseudonym, the Copyright Office does not investigate whether there is a provable connection between the claimant and the pseudonymous author.”
Actually saying same thing
@_date: 2019-05-23 12:19:36
I did, all it said is he “confirmed” he was the pseudonym.  This was directly after saying they don’t investigate the relationship between a claimant and a pseudonym.  After his long history of forging documents, I don’t trust anything he presented if it’s not investigated.
