I think;


Would, for sure, slow down the adoption speed of Bitcoin, and heavily reduce its usability at point of sale.   
But this doesn't negate Bitcoins strong store of value benefits and peer to peer network flexibility. Just like in Australia, they have tried to ban Piracy websites IP addresses such as PirateBay, they will never be able to block or control the actual peer to peer torrents effectively.   
The current point of sale fungibility of Bitcoin is awful, it is very difficulty and slow to actually convert the currency to local currency and spend it on goods and services. There are solutions like crypto Visa cards, but these are very far from even the crypto scene fully adopting.  
I would like to see those three big governing bodies try to stop a decentralized blockchain system, I believe it will be incredibly difficult, and potentially further promote more decentralization of the network, as large scale miners will be infeasible at a production scale at that point.

Thank you for your great response. This really highlights the magnitude of the current network state

Thank you very much, exactly what I wanted!

That would imply I have no understanding of WHY the federal reserve does what it does. The basics of increasing and decreasing interest rates to manage inflation and deflation, and backing a currency with stable assets such as exchange currencies and valuable commodities is a simple concept to most. 
I simply do not know at what point an asset class is defined as 'safe' or 'worthwhile' for the Fed reserve to hold. If you know, please inform me and anyone else that might be in the same position, thanks.

I'm not sure how a government managers a countries federal reserves, but I believe at some point, it will be unwise to NOT have BTC as one of its major assets

Oh for sure, I got into the scene pretty late (mid 2017), seeing prices at 2k, thinking, holy shit, it's gone up 10x in 2 years... then it proceeded to 10x again in a fraction of that time, which was just crazy to me. But do you think that given the current market conditions we could see lower than 5k this year, or potentially lower lows than last year? Revisit 1k-2k potentially? I feel like the buying power will be too strong for us to get there
@_date: 2019-08-10 06:08:34
Ahahaha so accurate
@_date: 2019-08-22 02:19:53
This market is insane! Can barely make a post without it being outdated within 15 minutes! We are not testing 9.5k yet though, I wonder if we will get that low, and if so, will be see a heavy buy rally at that point.

Correct, but it can also be a good indication of when to possibly make your trades when used in conjunction with a general idea of the markets momentum.
That is what I am asking, tell me what you think about the current market position, whether your thoughts are based off technical analysis or fundamentals. The very high hash rate at the moment maybe? Whatever it may be
@_date: 2019-08-10 04:26:16
This is very very interesting, thanks for the post
@_date: 2019-08-12 07:16:36
Correct, this is very true, a good graph to show it's stability would be BTC/Purchasing power, instead of BTC/USD would be interesting 
Not sure if this kind of live graph has been made or not, but that would be cool to see.

Everything is coming to the ground, Gold and BTC be flying
@_date: 2019-08-12 02:11:25
That's what I was thinking, theoretically it's impossible to stop everyone from minning, just like it's impossible to stop everyone from seeding torrents. They can for sure make it very difficult to use at point of sale, but that is about it
@_date: 2019-08-22 02:17:45
Interesting, I can definitely see this occurring, well if this is the case, how low do you see BTC falling, at what point does the buying power consolidate with the selling power?
@_date: 2019-08-13 23:15:58
The issue isn't that Bitcoin itself is in nature volatile, it is in fact only volatile due to the lack of market. Any stock or asset that has a very young and small market capital will experience high volatility. As the asset grows and matures, its volatility will calm down. Libra will be backed by a multitude of already established asset classes, mostly the USD, which in fact is already backed by a collection of stable asset classes chosen by the federal reserve. When Bitcoin gains more traction, and countries start to integrate $BTC into their reserves, stability will form. BTC has a LONG way to go though, the USD has over 14 Trillion in market supply (that being the market capitalization), which is over 70 times larger than the current Bitcoin market, Gold (XAU) not far behind, being around 7 Trillion. Even with this, look how volatile Gold still is relative to the USD. Not to mention the sociological hurdles that will come with spending other currencies that have not been the norm for most peoples lives (This is excluding the idea of traveling, as people expect this before doing so). When Fiat was introduced, that was "The Future Of Money" too, it took a substantial amount of time before people accepted it as the main form of value trade, not to mention it was heavily enforced by governance

Yeah, I know, I just want this to be debunked so I can yawn with you and get a good nights rest knowing my BTC is nice an super safe

Do you understand how the distributed collateral machine DAI stablecoin works? Also check out Nexo's crypto credit lines. 
Currently the only way to prove a reliable credit is to provide your own collateral. But the crypto credit space is still in its infantile phase. The entire idea of a loan is based on trust, which I'm sure you can imagine is difficult to quantify in a trusless decentralized anonymous space.

Why do governments keep trying to ban or increase the difficulty to obtain BTC, when ultimately, it is impossible to shut down? Look how well they have successfully put a stop to piracy...

Great response! One think that I question though is;


Only because this would also render everyone else's hardware useless too.


This makes a lot of sense though, and this the main reason I am confident in the network.
