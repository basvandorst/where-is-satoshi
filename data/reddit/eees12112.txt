I have a wallet with blockchain. I recently sent 800 dollars of bitcoin cash to a bitcoin address by mistake. I assumed since the addresses were the same, and since both currencies say, "bitcoin" in their name, that the currencies were interchangeable. I was wrong!
I have attempted to CONTACT BLOCKCHAIN FOR SEVERAL DAYS NOW, and they never respond to my email. I am getting the feeling that they don't care to help me at this point. I have sent them an email every 2 days for the past 10 days now, and nothing! I have even set up new accounts in the hopes that they would answer me and still nothing.
The wallet I sent the bitcoin cash to is telling me that they don't have it. They are telling me they do not accept bitcoin cash, and when I search the address I sent it to I can see the money is still there, and it has not been moved, so I believe them when they tell me they don't have it.  Or , if they do at least they have not tried to access it yet.
The company I sent the money to told me to contact blochain (the wallet I sent my money from) and ask them to cancel the transaction on their end. They are telling me that they cannot find the money in their system, and that I need blockchain to cancel the transaction on their end. 
When I go online it appears that if I don't own the private keys of the wallet I sent my money to I am screwed, and I don't. Is there anything I can do. Can blockchain help me or are they ignoring me because they plan on keeping the money. I keep receiving different responses. I am told by some that the money is lost. I am told by others that If I can get blockcain to work with me I can retrieve the money. The only problem with BLOCKCHAIN IS THEIR CUSTOMER SERVICE IS HORRIBLE, AND THEY NEVER RESPOND. IT HAS BEEN 10 DAYS NOW, AND NOTHING. I AM ALSO READING IN THE FORUMS THAT BLOCKCHAIN IS DOING THIS A LOT. THAT THEY ARE IGNORING (PURPOSELY) CUSTOMERS EMAILS WITH REGARDS TO ANY TYPE OF LOST COINS SITUATION.
Can you help me since BLOCKCHAIN HAS DECIDED TO IGNORE ME, AND PURPOSELY SCAM MYSELF, THEIR CUSTOMER! Yes, yes, yes... I know this is my fault, and if they cannot help me then yes maybe I scammed myself, BUT THE REASON I SAY BLOCKCHAIN WALLET IS A SCAM IS BECAUSE THEY REFUSE TO TALK TO ME? THEY HAVE NOT ATTEMPTED TO RESPOND TO ME NOR COMMUNICATE WITH ME. No company should ever do this.
CAN YOU HELP ME RECOVER MY LOST COINS WITH BLOCKCHAIN WALLETS?
Thank you,
