He's explaining what it is about bitcoin that gives it enormous value. He *could* have been a *tiny* bit less ambiguous and said something like:


but that makes for a much clumsier quote, and shouldn't be necessary.
@_date: 2018-01-05 09:48:32
But I think, in the context, since he'd just mentioned bitcoin, he'd probably been asked about bitcoin, bitcoin was by far the most well-known cryptocurrency at that time, etc. it's fair enough to assume that he thinks (thought) positively about bitcoin.

Practically speaking, what are the 'counterparty risks' that I, as an individual, face on a daily basis? I get the point about fees — I would like to pay 0 fees — but as far as I'm aware, the size of these is comparable between bitcoin and other methods (in fact, Bitcoin can often be *more* expensive).
Are we talking about fraud here, mainly? If I'm dealing with established businesses, do I really need to worry about that? I'm struggling to see a real tangible benefit that cryptocurrencies give me over fiat; am I protecting against *potential* drawbacks that I'm not currently familiar with?
Instantaneous transfers might be a selling point. Zero fees, too. Ultimately, what I really want is micropayments, but bitcoin appears to me to make micropayments impossible by design.

[This looks like a good set of instructions]( as far as I can tell. Note they don't say anything about using a machine that has "never been connected to the Internet" and they also mention, in step 6, the "the software's release signatures" which I what I was referring to ("checksum").
I don't see any mention of the private key in that section, so I'm not sure where that gets stored. But a LOT of that process happens offline, so is definitely secure. Maybe can explain whether their are any flaws in that process.

It doesn't really make any difference. The concept of 1 bitcoin is totally abstract, and just a psychological convenience, really. If it helps, you can always think of your holding in terms of satoshis which are 1 hundred-millionth of a bitcoin. So even if you only own 1 millionth of a bitcoin, you still own 100 satoshis :-)

There is no 'real' price, only the prices people have paid at various exchanges. If you want, you can try to average the price amongst them all and call *that* the 'real' price, but that's not very accurate since not all exchanges are equal.

Miners aren't breaking SHA-256, they're *partially* breaking it. A SHA-256 hash is 64-bytes long and current mining only breaks the 18 leading bytes. This gets progressively harder as time goes by and that number increases. It will get broken, one day, but not for a long, long time, at which point the blockchain algorithm will surely have evolved.

I was excited too — it's just human nature — but I think, deep down, I *wanted* it to be calm. Even if the price gets really high, really quickly, I'm not in for that much, so I wouldn't make a huge profit. I'm hodling for the long-run, so really it's in my interest for bitcoin to be stable, legitimate, and adopted by the mainstream. Many signals I've seen recently have suggested it is moving in that direction, I'm just hoping the futures don't lead to a huge crash and cast doubt on bitcoin altogether.
@_date: 2017-12-12 14:15:01
Does the Open Source project offer alternatives? If not, they've signalled a willingness to accept that fees will be an issue. If I were you, I'd donate whatever amount would mean the total, including fees, was 10 Euros (e.g. 6.50 euros, or whatever). You're still paying the same amount and the project would rather receive 6.50 euros than nothing.
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:47:35
Well, you can choose a very low fee, but it might not get confirmed at all if it's not worth it to the miners. But my point is that, a group could prioritise a certain transaction — I think — if they wanted.
@_date: 2017-12-10 12:59:24
What effect will LN have on a typical transaction fee? Will fees get so low that micro payments become viable? For me, this is the blocker for bitcoin to go from niche to widespread adoption.

There are LOADS of bitcoin ticker sites out there, they should show you the big increase in volume since about 20 minutes ago, when the futures markets ended. Also, the fluctuations in price since then. This is a good example:

Seems everyone's misunderstood your question. Although I don’t know the answer, if I had to guess I’d say the simplest is simply the value of the most recent trade.

Sell bitcoin at X for USD. Buy bitcoin at Y with USD. If Y is less than X, you now have more bitcoin.

The important question is, will it dip below its current value?
@_date: 2017-12-12 16:26:17


That's precisely *because* the fees are so high.
@_date: 2017-12-12 14:46:23
I agree. I think the only way to make that happen is to use it, with the hope that future modifications (Lightning Network, etc.) will reduce fees and lower transaction times. Yours is a perfect use case: you have nothing to lose if the total amount is what you were prepared to donate. It's the project that suffers from the higher fees; as far as I'm concerned, that's fair enough.
@_date: 2017-12-08 10:32:26
Yes, but you wouldn't want the dollars if it did!
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:18:29


a) Depends on how many btc you have, and how expensive the thing you’re buying is, factors in any transaction, no matter what the currency. If you have 1 btc and you’re buying a cup of coffee, the difference between price today and double the price in a week is so little (relative to your wealth), that it might be worth the novelty value alone.
b) Depends on how much you paid for your bitcoins versus current price. If you bought in at 7k, you’re effectively paying half-price for that cup of coffee versus paying for it in dollars.

@_date: 2017-12-08 15:40:20

Is there a way that miners can organise and prioritise a specific transaction if they think it's a 'good cause'? If people were willing to support it, that could make microtransactions feasible; as it is, the fees are just a bit too prohibitive.

I obviously don't know what your relationship with your wife is like, but I happen to think the best course of action in these cases is to confide in your partner as early as possible. If this is genuinely the main problem in your marriage, then I really think you stand a better chance discussing it, even explaining the lengths that you nearly went to, but haven't yet. Who knows, she might even agree that the gamble is worth it once you explain it to her, and you can make the decision together.
