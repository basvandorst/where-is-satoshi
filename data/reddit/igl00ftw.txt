@_date: 2014-01-17 20:24:39
peopel are thinking this sale will crush BTC market. but this sale wotn haoppen that soon and may not touch the market at all - they may keep the coins for some time. people are panic selling now but they shouldnt

@_date: 2013-12-16 04:30:02
they have this issue, my BLF died like that too.
@_date: 2013-12-17 19:57:51
if they declare it, that means they already have access to all our data.
@_date: 2013-12-21 18:40:07
i assume they did what was spoken before when forum of bitcoin foundation leaked. they try to be able to reverse/deny transactions. if thats the case we should all move from BTC to LTC or NMC. that ould mean this is end of bitcoin liek ti was designed.
@_date: 2013-12-18 12:08:39
sounds good!
@_date: 2013-12-17 04:20:56
oh i dont expect them to do anything. just i found it funny they write that and since i had all thsi cans stored because i didnt clean my room.. i decided to make a pic and see what happends.
@_date: 2013-12-17 18:30:24

@_date: 2013-11-16 13:11:34
this is preety crazy. Seems BTC may soon becaome just another version fo USD controlled by .gov
@_date: 2013-12-21 23:15:39
you are wrong.
imagine BTC is USD and blockchain is CreditCard.
if the CC takes ur data or transfers them - that is an issue.
@_date: 2013-12-12 02:47:53
this is elite.
@_date: 2013-11-30 03:59:45
fees ar too high for such blocks imo
@_date: 2013-10-30 03:46:18
good one!
@_date: 2013-04-11 23:18:00
ill take a coin or even cent from anybody that wills to share!
@_date: 2013-12-17 04:07:40
just to add - its not biased. i DO drink theirs stuff daily. hers ie my post of 2012 blog donations with their beer brand inside - 
i just wonder if they really support the movement or wante to get a bit with link bait.
