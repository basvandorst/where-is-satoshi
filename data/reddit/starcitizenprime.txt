The problem is there is not much you can still buy with BTC. Fees are to high and time is to long.
And dont want allways to trade it to LTC to buy something.

Sorry thats bullshit. LN will not solve the Problems of bitcoin. 
Altcoins are there for reason. There are different szenarios where altcoins work much better.
See ETH or IOTA. Thats szenarios where BTC is not usefull. And also there is this Bcash token which will have variable blocksize soon. 
I thing this will scale even better as LN.
Btw. i just hold altcoins and no BTC or BCH so please do your civil war without me. I am just an observer.

Can Simeone explain how 8mb will centralize the bch Chain ? Can Unserstand this Argument. If even sha256 is the Problem. Take this away Like zcash / ETH / other Alts and you are more than btx / bch will ever be.

Soon (TM).

Nope. Bitcoin will be soon meaningless. Gen 2/3 Cryopto will take the lead after this HUGH DIP (we are just in 1/3 of what will come).
Or do you still visit your myspace Page ? Bitcoin is Myspace. Leave as long you can.

its more likely to happen today at 17.38 CEST + 1.
Its common sense. Everybody knows it...

But bitcoin has major tech Problems. 
It doesnt scale, the mempool is filling, the miner are leaving...
There is more other cryptos which perform better. But all all if the dinosaure fall. Thats sad and we need to unleash us from this paradigm.

But they allrdy started to Pump the money into Bitcoin and generated a ATM.
Not that the "Hackers" dont buy any BTC we will see a price lost about 5% i guese

Bitfinex is good. Fasted one.
@_date: 2017-11-24 07:01:11
They wont. Next BTC Diff is -25% so there is eaven no reason. 
I trade all Bitcoins this and cash. Whats going on there is speculation. But if there is a push fpr about 600$ just because of a speculation. I thing both sides are a little to salty. Let the market decide.
And so far the market decide there is room for two bitcoins. I thing the guys which are extrem salty here are the one which dumpes BCH  1 and now miss theyr profit. So in /btc the guys which sold theys BTC  are the most toxic.
