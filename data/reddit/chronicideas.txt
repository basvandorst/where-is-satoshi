Couldn't agree more with this statement
@_date: 2017-02-14 12:06:49
This dude knows whats up
@_date: 2017-02-01 14:26:23
According to the documentary "Banking on Bitcoin" which I watched last night, we will reach 100% coins mined in the year 2140.

I've been thinking of doing this to buy on a £10k order but I don't like to think of my money sitting on an exchange for god knows how long
@_date: 2017-02-06 12:55:23
This is my thinking, looking at investing 10,000 GBP
@_date: 2017-02-14 12:20:14
It's like your posting what I'm thinking. This is close to what i'm doing. I'm getting about £16,000 GBP in inheritance, and I currently live very comfortably without savings, but my girlfriend keeps moaning at me to not put all my eggs in one basket, which is fair, so I'm putting £10K into BTC and hodling, £5K as a starting investment into a Stocks and Shares ISA and then adding £500 a month into that ISA, to hopefully save for a house or something in 4 years or so. The £1K I have left over I'm either gonna spend on things I want/need to help beat the urge of going into my savings basically, or probably just add it to my emergency funds if there's nothing I want.

What if there's a hard fork? (I hope not)
@_date: 2017-02-16 14:44:54
@_date: 2017-02-17 14:31:44
Doesn't a decision HAVE to be made on March 11th? They've run out of extensions now I believe.
@_date: 2017-02-21 14:57:35
I won't have money to invest until around March 21st, I hope price isn't 3k+ cos of ETF then :(
@_date: 2017-02-07 10:17:39

Don't mine. Buy bitcoin and HODL to the moon
@_date: 2017-02-17 10:44:24
what's your reasoning?
@_date: 2017-02-01 14:27:51
I think you've been spoon fed nonsense.
@_date: 2017-02-06 14:03:43
What about all this talk though about BU or a hard fork occurring, if BU became the original instead of Core I'm not so sure I would be laughing
@_date: 2017-02-17 16:05:59
haha very good
@_date: 2017-02-09 10:19:00
Thank you for posting this. The way I see it is we need a long term solution without the risk of a currency split. sigh.
@_date: 2017-02-06 12:05:51
Can you ELI5 why dollar averaging works out better because I've heard mixed reviews. If price keeps going up surely I'd be losing out
@_date: 2017-02-08 11:18:34
TO THE MOOOOOONNNNNNNNN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@_date: 2017-02-06 13:27:54
Problem with this though is if I buy weekly through an exchange I could ultimately be paying more in transfer fees and exchange fees than if I do one lump sum
@_date: 2017-03-17 10:26:29
I have an HSBC account and a Fidor account, I plan on investing ~£10k into BTC and ETH.  Do you suggest transferring from HSBC to Fidor and then Fidor to the exchange???
@_date: 2017-02-06 13:27:20
I know but last week it was lower lol
@_date: 2017-03-21 12:35:39
Please tell me if I understand this correctly, if a HF happens which one of the following will happen?
1. Let's say I have 10 BTC, if the HF happens then I have 10 BTC and 10 BTU ??
2. Let's say I have 10 BTC, if the HF happens then I have 5 BTC and 5 BTU ?? 
Can you please tell me which one it is? Thanks.
@_date: 2017-03-21 10:32:52
Can you please elaborate on this? I was planning to store on a col hardware wallet like Trezor or something.
@_date: 2017-03-07 13:25:16
Open an account with Fidor UK (who have partnered with Kraken),
Send your money to Fidor bank account.
Send from Fidor to Kraken via SEPA transfer.
Fidor have the lowest fees too, think it only costs like £2.50 for SEPA.
@_date: 2017-03-02 12:41:58
I get a large inheritance to invest a couple weeks after March 11th. I hope that's not too late to get on this money train. I plan on hodling for four years minimum.
@_date: 2017-02-01 10:06:11
Fidor has personal account numbers now
@_date: 2017-03-02 15:25:19
Oh of course, I have a stocks and shares ISA too and also some other index funds
@_date: 2017-03-21 10:41:33
Thank you good sir!
@_date: 2017-02-08 14:39:13
TO THE MOON
@_date: 2017-03-02 14:03:59
surely if its just the rule change on mar 11th id be ok to wait and buy on like march 20th??
@_date: 2017-01-21 11:18:38
Thank you for your good advice. But how many accountants know about Bitcoin? Are you saying if I sold a five figure value of Bitcoins via Local Bitcoins I wouldn't get flagged by HSBC and everything would be ok?
@_date: 2017-01-21 11:26:27
That's one example, there are others. Google is your friend.
@_date: 2017-01-25 12:38:55
Can you please explain in terms of Bitcoin what "leverage" is please? Cheers.
@_date: 2017-01-25 12:53:42
What do you guys think 1btc will be worth in 2020?
@_date: 2017-01-28 16:13:18
Surely if I logged all my trades and declared everything on my self assessment tax returns then it would all be fine right? I'm not trying to do anything illegal, I just want to make some extra pocket money if possible.
@_date: 2017-01-28 17:13:23
Can you please expand on the abbreviations you used?
@_date: 2017-01-21 17:17:25
Is there an easy way to work out tax stuff for self assessment and capital gains tax etc or would I just get an accountant to figure it all out?
@_date: 2017-01-29 00:02:07
Then how do people on LocalBitcoins sell BTC and have been doing it for years?
@_date: 2017-01-25 12:07:11
I go on holiday a lot. Backpacking round India soon, this £5,000 I have put aside from other funds specifically for investing to help towards a mortgage eventually when I'm a lot older or something.
@_date: 2017-01-25 15:51:39
I just compared a £5k buy on Coinfloor against LocalBitcoins and it seems LocalBitcoins would currently pay me roughly 0.15 BTC more.
@_date: 2017-01-25 14:52:53
how much time do i give before each smaller buy?
@_date: 2017-01-25 12:40:12
Thanks I like that divide. Need to learn trading so would definitely want to start small with that.
@_date: 2017-01-31 17:18:32
Ok thanks,
I believe my Fidor bank account is in GBP, and they only support SEPA transfer, so just wanted to make sure I can SEPA transfer to the GBP/BTC book?
@_date: 2017-01-25 15:58:52


Very true, thank you :)
@_date: 2017-01-29 10:10:45
no actually it's because i havent sold any yet.
@_date: 2017-01-25 12:06:29
not much experience trading but have lots of books etc I could read.  I'm preferring to sit on it for 3 years though yeah. Just hoping that I would definitely get a decent return. I can arguably invest a max of £15,000 GBP but thought I would spread it and invest some in bitcoins and others in bonds etc
@_date: 2017-01-25 17:52:09
I think I should put 20% into various alt coins and the rest in Bitcoins?
@_date: 2017-01-28 17:15:05
My searches show me OFAC is US related. As the title of my post states, I am in UK
@_date: 2017-01-21 11:08:31
I have read stories that if you buy Bitcoins via national bank transfer and you or the other person is an idiot and puts "bitcoin" in the reference then it will get flagged by the bank and possibly freeze your account.  Additionally, I've never really had a large chunk of money going in or out of my account before so am worried that because that's out of my character it would also raise flags.  I have received a large inheritance and am wondering the best way to invest it.
@_date: 2017-01-28 16:35:20
Fair point this is what I am mainly worried about. I heard from some sources to open an account with Fidor bank, is this a good option?
@_date: 2017-01-21 11:31:13
Thank you so much for this answer. I am looking to get on the property ladder in London as a first time buyer but my current savings isn't enough unless I invest smart or go shared ownership.  Thank you again for you answer. However, I'm a bit young to be marrying my girlfriend just yet lol
@_date: 2017-01-25 13:33:15
Yeah looking at getting KeepKey
@_date: 2017-01-25 17:43:10
Trump's team is potentially filled with huge Bitcoin advocates like Peter Thiel and Balaji Srinivasan.
Also how is Bitcoin centralized? 
Also, what happens in America can affect other global markets like China almost like a chain effect? I suggest you read up a bit more. However, I might hedge and invest some in alt coins etc like Ethereum too. Cheers.
@_date: 2017-01-25 16:00:19
I dont have experience using exchanges like this to be honest, i normally do direct bank transfer trade using LocalBitcoins, can you guide me through the difference and how to do it via Coinfloor exchange for better rates etc please?
@_date: 2017-01-21 11:09:07
Thanks, I am looking on how to invest an inheritance, if I made profit from it but then had trouble turning it back into fiat money then I would be very sad
@_date: 2017-01-25 16:13:46
That is also true but if it drops that much then all I would do is keep holding in the hopes it will eventually go up.
@_date: 2017-01-25 15:23:51
It's always gone up and down but if you look at it in the long term from a few years ago it can has gone up pretty significantly and I think it will continue to go up during Trump's presidency.  Additionally in 2020 is when the next halving will occur which will also have some sort of impact, probably positive.
@_date: 2017-01-21 15:32:34
did you declare your capital gains tax?
@_date: 2017-01-28 19:02:06
Would having a transparent meeting with my bank manager be of any help to me?
@_date: 2017-01-25 14:53:50
Can you elaborate?
@_date: 2017-01-21 11:15:11
Could you help explain how I would know how much Capital Gains tax i would need to pay? 18 or 28% ?? And how would I go about reporting the tax? Sorry Im a bit new to this.
@_date: 2017-01-25 17:01:55
This comes down to the individual and their perception on money and  their money management. I view this £5,000 the same as I would if I took it to a casino or I put it into my business bank account.  Once I move it, it's money I no longer have and it's also money that I can afford to lose.
@_date: 2017-01-25 13:32:19
Hilarious, have a downvote.
@_date: 2018-06-15 14:18:09
Yet eth is still stuck in a bear market :(

This is my first investment but I've been a lurker on this sub for a while.  I plan to HODL for a minimum of 4 years.
@_date: 2017-05-23 20:01:48
@_date: 2017-05-22 10:30:09
This is a great answer, thank you!
@_date: 2017-05-22 10:14:09
I simply asked for advice, any decision that is acted upon is ultimately mine at the end of the day, why would I blame someone else? Stop making uneducated assumptions.
@_date: 2017-05-25 08:38:32
I'm going all in now 
@_date: 2017-07-18 19:58:07
Surely rd better to think in terms of number of BTC. If I mined I would add it to my existing hodl and keep hodling until moon
@_date: 2017-07-29 16:03:32
That's a lot to some people 
@_date: 2017-07-29 14:38:47
If you Store your coins on an exchange then they're not really your coins, sigh.
@_date: 2017-07-18 19:46:56
100% definitely but it's better to mine dogecoin
@_date: 2017-07-16 10:06:32
Ledger Nano s 
@_date: 2017-07-18 19:52:53
thanks, I had a look at r/bitcoinmining but unlike r/ethermining they didn't have stickied posts for no0b guides
@_date: 2017-07-18 19:50:41
why are they even selling a new antminer then? why would anyone buy one if what you say is so true?
@_date: 2017-05-27 12:47:18
That's not really a ELI5 but thanks
@_date: 2017-05-26 19:31:28
Sorry I meant $2450
@_date: 2017-05-22 09:36:33
Ok but my monthly deposits from my work paychecks fall outside the scope of this initial 10k, should I DCA the initial 10k or lump sum it?
@_date: 2017-05-27 11:05:50
This makes me feel better, I put ~10k USD near the top, cared a bit about price dropping but I'm in it until minimum 4 years, I believe!
@_date: 2017-05-30 17:39:38
I do the same thing I probably check the price every ten minutes even though I'm planning to hodl for at least four years
@_date: 2017-06-04 10:21:47
Finally I'm breaking even again, only took a week :) hodling for another 207 weeks minimum.
