I dont think it will make that much of a difference. We'll need other layers before we can use it as a currency worldwide

Lol redditor for one week
@_date: 2017-12-06 04:45:44
To go to 10K, lets start at 1$. It's a 1 000 000% gain
Then to 20K if we start at 10K, its 100% gain
And there is a lot more exposure and a better reputation
@_date: 2017-12-01 23:58:05
Lol haven't tought of that one. Well tought
@_date: 2017-12-09 13:32:00
... what a drop mr prophet
@_date: 2017-12-08 10:39:44
If you sent it this week and you're in america it took me 2 weeks each time to have the money credited at Kraken.
@_date: 2017-12-09 06:02:36
When you enter the amount you wanna send, there will be a pen, you can click on it to have options for the fees
@_date: 2017-12-11 05:50:40
Dont trust anyone with a price prediction, they dont know, no one knows
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:23:43
You can change it, I did. In the currencies settings
@_date: 2017-12-02 23:08:22
I like the way you think. I'm saving this for later!
@_date: 2017-12-05 17:15:53
Or down if all the regular investors short it
@_date: 2017-12-01 18:33:12
Just google "bail in" and remember no one can take your bitcoins if they dont have your private keys
@_date: 2017-12-11 05:59:30
@_date: 2017-12-08 11:15:03
Good luck!
@_date: 2017-12-04 05:58:19
It did with... cryptokitties
@_date: 2017-12-08 08:13:31
I gave 0,002 to some people at my job when it was worth 10$
@_date: 2017-12-08 10:15:12
Well it was the least I could do, they were tired of hearing me talk about that "Bidcoin" thing...
Yes one of the called it Bidcoin lol
@_date: 2017-12-09 14:12:37
What about when you said "in the next 5 minutes"?
@_date: 2017-12-11 05:58:06
When enough people ise it, it wouldnt fluctuate that much, with a small market cap its easy to make it move that much. Give the same market cap to USD and other countries will play with it much more
@_date: 2017-12-06 04:37:14
I think they match those who short with those who think it will go up... But I dont really know. 
They make their money on the matches, not on the bets
@_date: 2017-12-08 10:37:07
XD gambler mind. Bitcoin will drop soon, might not be before christmas, but alts will rise. I wouldnt take that risk
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:12:37
If you always receive on the same address would it be ok?
@_date: 2017-12-09 05:43:32
Yeah right. I think it will drop when the futures will start but I'm not sure what people will do about those forks, I mean people bought bitcoins for the bitcoin gold fork.
@_date: 2017-12-11 12:03:59
The people are backing it, p2p currency.
@_date: 2017-12-08 10:32:04
Dont buy BTC now!
I always say we must take risks in life, but this one is not looking good.
Look what coins do 2 days before the events.
There's a reason we say buy the rumor sell the news
And guess what? We're 2 days before the futures.
P.S. I cant tell the future, you do what you want
@_date: 2017-12-02 00:00:58
And I think he's talking about bitcoin cash
@_date: 2017-12-01 18:47:42
Bet the next christmas supper
@_date: 2017-12-02 23:10:39
If you're not from japan, it can rake up to 20 days "openables"?
@_date: 2017-12-08 10:34:47
I suspect there is other things, might be the one thing that will make everything fall apart.
I'm not saying you should get married though, find a good friend and remember to say nohomo each time.
Bromance is the best!

There's bilionnaires in this world, arent they holding?
The thing is if no one uses it it wont be a currency, some people will use it, some will hold because there is no inflation.
Where I live everyone is getting fucked with their retirement funds. The government just cut off the retirements of their employees by about 50% and there is "negociations" but what do you want us to do in the end, the government is poor too, they'll have to up the taxes to pay if the employees win.
So I prefer "hodling" my money in bitcoin and being safe about that because my generation will get fucked even harder. That's why holding is not always a bad thing. But people will use it if it comes to a point where we can spend it. We need to live, why would no one spend it?
@_date: 2017-12-09 05:48:56
You can change the fees for low
@_date: 2017-12-09 06:05:20
I did it before, it worked fine (like instantaneous) but I dont know with this mempool. If its not urgent I'm pretty sure it will go trough one day lol.
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:40:47
Marketing sales staff, because they'll be able to sell the idea that their coin is a store of value, like gold, if they fail to make a peer to peer currency.
@_date: 2017-12-11 05:37:37
1) Bitcoin is backed by the market, like all the other currencies. Forex is deciding the price, not the governments.
2) I'm not sure what you mean.
3) if your government lock you up for using a currency created by the people for the people you are not the problem. Your government is.
@_date: 2017-12-06 05:58:47
Miners, to cover the costs of their electricity if their bitcoins are worth less
Same way farmers short a part of what they produce in case of a drop in price
@_date: 2017-12-11 12:10:53
What's backing gold?
@_date: 2017-08-15 06:57:54
Damn and here I am, dreaming of owning 1 Bitcoin lol
@_date: 2017-08-15 14:01:52
Working on it ;)
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:26:17
It has always been the free market intention. The 1 mb hard cap might be bad though
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:11:41
10M bitcoins on my phone!
But seriously... Nice try FBI!
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:10:37
He was damn right about the price though
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:43:39
It's a trap. They may look like females but they have a dick
@_date: 2017-11-03 09:32:51
You know big institutions like goldman sachs are getting in soon right? 
You really think investors will let a drop happen without jumping in?
I personnaly would take a loan to buy bitcoins at 1 000$
So if there's no big news about bitcoin getting cracked or getting banned by big countries, it wont drop 75%
P.S. I try not to make predictions but I think it will crash something like 25% in less then 2 weeks simply because of the 2X fork. But beside that, I dont see why it would crash more.
The bigger the market cap, the more stable will be BTC!
@_date: 2017-11-13 04:46:14
Typo from a drunk guy
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:04:25
You're giving us posts about the future XD
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:54:41
When I look at the book orders on Kraken I see nothing
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:07:43
Step 1 : buy some
Step 2 : wait until all they say happen
Step 3 : ???
Step 4 : profit
Edit : sorry for the Faggot thing but it needed to be done
@_date: 2017-11-26 06:39:45
I'm not joking, it's one of my concerns. I have one of my uncles who is calling non stop at his bank because he forgot his password. Seriously ask him to keep a 24 words sheet... and then ask him to add security with a passphrase
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:29:27
Let the doubters doubt until we are ready for mass adoption
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:00:28
Awesome didn't know there was a btcusd stock
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:52:13
Where can I see that?
@_date: 2017-11-25 14:42:22
Listen, I would put all my BTCs in alts but I have a checking wallet and a saving wallet and the way the fees are going up, I dont think it's gonna go trough
@_date: 2017-11-26 01:38:13
Just put a passphrase on it and hide it
@_date: 2017-11-03 09:48:39
I see your point but the more I read about Bitcoin, the more I want to throw my money at it. (I'm not rich and do not want to take a loan though... I'm a student). I have no knowledge about coding, I am reading a lot and I am trying really hard to understand EVERY aspect of bitcoin. So how can I help the Bitcoin ecosystem? I think working hard and putting money in the project is showing my interest and can help support the cause.
I'm not a bank hater though. I see bitcoin more like a way to offer easy "financial" services to the poorest on this planet, transfer of money between people in need. I'm offering 0,002BTC to a lot of people around me because I can and because I want to initiate interested people into it (as a student, I have a part-time student job and most people around me are not the richest people. They are mostly immigrants and send money to their families, they love the ease of use and the delays of Bitcoin. A good part of them are young and learn fast about it).
My goal is to have 1 full bitcoin for myself one day and I dont care if the price crash, I try not putting more than I can afford to lose.
If you have any idea how I can help more the Bitcoin ecosystem I would be happy to hear it.
Lets say that I live in a country where education is cheap and I am not at all in a domain that could be related to crypto.
Edit : sorry if bad english, my first language is not english.
Edit 2 : I try not making too much transactions as I know Bitcoin cannot support enough transactions for the moment. I am 100% willing to spend my Bitcoin (part of a full one for the moment lol) for anything I would need (and buy it back if I want). I dont believe the whole HODL mentality would be good for Bitcoin in the long run as it would be used more like a store of value. 
My view on Bitcoin is constantly evolving and I would like feedback :)
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:13:04
That's awesome. Where did you get that?
@_date: 2017-11-03 09:55:27
Not 100%. The big institutions are in but not their investors as they cant get the regulations and could get in big trouble if they dont do it right.
I'm also worried about like the army trying to crack Bitcoin as there seems to be a consensus about the american army being 10 years in advance of us in technology.
@_date: 2017-11-20 05:52:06
Why there is the ripple logo around it?
@_date: 2017-11-03 14:01:31
Lol it was announced in magazines?

Banks... -.-
@_date: 2017-09-15 17:47:10
Or the big orange, bitcoin investment INC
@_date: 2017-09-11 05:06:16
Finally an exchange where you can tarde your bitcoins
@_date: 2017-10-03 07:08:21
You should take a look at nem, it has already been tested (mijin), fees will be lower than bitcoin and there is more than just the currency side to it
@_date: 2017-09-27 04:53:27
... ok what's the difference?
@_date: 2017-09-15 17:38:03
I will build one of the great companies and maybe one day I'll become president... Who knows.
@_date: 2017-09-14 21:39:18
Please sell, my money is not on Kraken yet
@_date: 2017-09-27 03:33:33

On their website I think, wait, I'm working on it lol
@_date: 2017-10-06 02:50:39
What's the difference?
Sorry if dumb question
@_date: 2017-10-04 12:22:21
No you need to confirm every transaction manually
@_date: 2017-10-04 13:53:33
Got it
@_date: 2017-10-14 22:28:42
If you're both wrong, is he alive or dead?

Source for trezor and ledger nano s having a malware?
@_date: 2017-10-04 13:13:04
On the device
It confirms the amount you're sending, the recipient address and the fees.
Edit : ans--&gt;and

You cant have a segwit address though, can you?
