That's nonsense. Pseudonymity can lead to anonymity, as long as people can sufficiently untie their identities from their pseudonyms. Without a source of data that links the pseudonym to the identity, the NSA or any third party is powerless to unmask the address. Otherwise they would have unmasked Satoshi Nakamato long ago.

I've done transfers from Bulgaria and I can't sympathize enough with you. I was banking with [DSK]( in the beginning and they would actually charge me a fee of 6 euros every time I **received** a transfer that exceed 100 euros. Eventually i switched to First Investment Bank which at least doesn't have fees for incoming transfers. 
I've been to other EU countries and in most of them the fees for SEPA transfers are **0** there (I am sure that's the case in Belgium for example). The problem with Bulgaria is that since it's still not in the EURO zone it treats most of these transfers as SWIFT, and therefore charges ridiculously high fees. I really wish there was any other way to send money back and forth from Bulgaria other than having to wait for the country to join the euro.

Correlation does not imply causation. I would actually submit to you that the state emerged as an organizational technology for human civilization and allowed humanity to evolve beyond the pre-historical tribal social structure precisely because of the emergence of money as a means of transfering value. Empires and states would never have existed if there was no easy mechanism to transfer value whether it be throug metal coins, gold, and eventually paper money. You seem to suggest that the state emerges indepently of money, and I don't think that is true. There never was a state or empire without money (with the exception of perhaps the [Incan Empire]( which still preplexes historians as a great mystery). In fact the opposite is true, if there was no money we would still be roaming the forsts and jungles in small tribal packs of hunter-gatherers.

No, it is not true that the blockchain would have value without BTC. The value of this particular blockchain is that it provides a consensus about transaction history. That consensus is only possible because miners are willing to secure the blockchain in exchange for BTC as a currency. Without BTC as a currency, there would exist no incentive to secure the blockchain, the history would be easily falsifiable, and therefore the blockchain would have no value.

It won't work. The only way for the government to destroy bitcoin is to push its price to zero. By dividing the existing bitcoins in circulation into dirty and clean ones, and blocking the dirty ones, they are effectively removing those from circulation and reducing the money supply thus pushing the price of the clean bitcoins even further up - the exact opposite of their original intention. 
Governments are stuck between a rock and a hard place with regard to bitcoin. Their attempts to destroy the system only strengthens it and further validates the protocol.

With the emergence of distributed exchanges like ripple, it will be very difficult to block the flow of money in and out of bitcoin. Closing the centralized exchanges will only be a temporary victory for them, and will have no real benefit. Worse for them, they will have forsaken their ability to monitor the movement of money. At least now they are able to associate bitcoin addresses to real identities as most of the exchanges require some form of identification. At this point they know they are fighting a losing battle, and that the harder they fight bitcoin the stronger they will make it.

You are confusing inflation with an increase in the money supply. Inflation is defined in terms of the purchasing power of the currency, and its value in terms of a basket of goods and services. So in that sense bitcoin is not inflationary because its purchasing power has been increasing. That's independent of the fact that the number of bitcoins in circulation has been increasing.

Bitcoin will never fully replace centralized fiat currencies. Operating bitcoin incurs a non-zero cost because of the energy expenditure required to grow the block-chain. A centralized government currency, on the other hand, will not have to incur that cost due to its centralized nature - the official blockchain will simply be the one the government recognizes, rather than the one with the highest diffiiculty. 
While Bitcoin will not destroy fiat, it still has the potential to be widely successful given how terribly inefficient and wasteful the current banking system is. Even with proof-of-work, the cost associated with running bitcoin still pales in comparison with the humongous drain on the productive economy that Wall St banks have become. What bitcoin will hopefully do is set an **UPPER LIMIT** to the cost of financial transactions and the banking system in general, and thus drive the parasitic investment banks out of business. Central or government run banks will continue to exist as they have for hundreds of years, but their profitability will be reduced significantly.

Precisely, and this is why bitcoin will never replace fiat. A centralized clearing house will always be more efficient than the distributed blockchain. However, rather than using this inherent efficiency for the social good, today's central bankers have turned into parasites that suck in vast amounts of resources from the productive economy, orders of magnitude higher than what bitcoin "wastes". In the future I foresee a significantly leaner central banking system that coexists with a bitcoin-like distributed network. Bitcion's role eventually will be to set an upper bound to the price of banking, and prevent excess and abuses in the centralized systems of money.

I don't think human lives should be measured in money, but even even if your (offensive) example was valid, the economic cost of producing a person would certainly be far higher than just the 10 minutes that you describe. You would need to factor in the cost of raising the child, paying for the education, healthcare, and all the things that a person would consume to reach the point that they are at.
Besides, in a perfect free market prices would always tend to the cost of production, as excessively high profit margins would attract new players into the markets, unless you have some kind of a monopoly situation.
@_date: 2013-04-08 15:23:21


That is emphatically untrue. Bitcoin will never destroy the current banking system, it will simply reduce it in size. The cost of running a decentralized banking system based on bitcoin is the energy spent on proof-of-work, and therefore a centralized system which requires no such cost will always have an advantage. The leaner and meaner central banks will still survive after bitcoin becomes mainstream, but they will only be able to extract rent from the economy up to the upper limit of cost set by bitcoin instead of the current exorbitant amounts. 
@_date: 2013-04-05 23:02:52

Part of what makes bitcoins valuable to people is the ability to easily convert them to and from fiat currencies. As the exchanges come under attack, and that belief under question, it is natural for the price to fall down.

Moreover, at negative rates, borrowers will simply be able to make money by borrowing. You will simply be able to borrow a large amount of btc, sit on them for a bit, and return them while charging a sweet interest. Negative rates don't make any sense even during deflation.

Sure. There is no doubt that this is a bubble, but the real question at what stage of the bubble are we? Are at the early stage, or the late stage? This could go all the way up to $100 and then crash back to $50, and you'll still make a profit by bying at these price levels.  This has happened many times in the history of bitcoins.

There is a law in numeric cognition stating that the relationship between stimulus and perception is logarithmic. This logarithmic relationship means that if a stimulus varies as a geometric progression (i.e., multiplied by a fixed factor), the corresponding perception is altered in an arithmetic progression (i.e., in additive constant amounts). It is true for almost almost all human senses. This is why the intensity of sound is measured in [decibels]( (log scale), the brightness of stars in [apparent magnitude]( (log scale), and it only natural that the BTC price is measured on a logarithmic scale as well.

That actually is a very good idea. The blockchain provides documented evidence of when you acquired the bitcoins and capitals gains tax can be estimated from checking the market price at that time.

I think counterparty risk also plays a major role. With bitcoin you don't have to trust a third party to ensure your funds are safe, whereas with Mastercard you need to trust a company to ensure it doesn't freeze or disappear your funds.

A lot of mainstream media are a bit premature in announcing the death of Bitcoin. This is not the beginning of the end, but merely the end of the beginning.
