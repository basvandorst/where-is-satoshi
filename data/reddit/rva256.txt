And what exactly is wrong with spending only on things you really need? This is the typical US mentality where development/happiness = spending tons of money on shit you don't really need and then dumping it into landfills.

Sure, coz spending only on stuff you need translates to going back to 18th century and everyone losing their jobs. I don't know how familiar you are with the concept of re-allocation of jobs. Apple employees could hypothetically be working on climate change and renewable energy coz guess what - that's something we NEEED right now. 
Also btw, nothing wrong with growing your own food either. I could have a backyard where my food grows and be working on particle physics simultaneously.

Umm, that's why "we kids" don't keep our money on exchanges, sir.

The fact that you feel so certain that that is the only reason people buy bitcoin shows your ignorance.

Maybe I didn't quite understand what you are saying. But now I have a more basic question. Can't you send money from a segwit wallet to a non-segwit one? If so, then why do you suggest waiting for wider adoption?

People around the world are shifting and getting real jobs in renewables, mate. But I guess US has to stick to hypothetical jobs since dicktator Trump pulled out of the Paris agreement.

Do you think really think people using bitcoin as a currency wouldn't go to restaurants, use laptops, watch movies, use uber etc? Just because a currency is (currently) deflationary doesn't mean people sit in a shack eating bananas while waiting for the value to go up. 
People do spend, each according to whatever he/she thinks are his/her "needs". People do work, pay taxes on their salaries, products etc. Only difference is that people get rewarded for saving money securely with themselves, rather than being rewarded for being in debt with a bank.

Well, as a primary form of currency, bitcoin also stops being deflationary according to its design. In fact, the rate of its deflation is inversely related to its adoption. 
Note that I am not claiming me or anyone knows the exact trajectory and outcome along the process of its adoption. But saying with certainty that the economy would go on a downward spiral or come to a grinding halt as claimed in the original comment is also an overreach. It is not backed by any such historic events (there have been very few to begin with), or by most economists. We do know very well the horrors of hyperinflation though, which we can avoid with certainty with a limited money supply.

Interesting. Although I'm sure people who don't want to pay taxes will just split and form a separate blockchain and an alt-coin. Bringing us back to the question.
