Not completely true. Any bank that is a member of the federal reserve is a shareholder in the federal reserve. They even get dividends from these shares. Totally public. 
See ex: 
List of large banks. 
The law on holding stock in the fed. 
Section 2.3.

Here's a tip I used and got my request accepted: You can find your IP in "Details" at the bottom of Gmail's web interface. If most of your login IPs are the same, you might have a good chance with using that.

Better for your heirs in the US too. They don't get their federal income taxed on the gain (FMV - price you bought it at) if you bequest it to them.

Not sure if it's entirely an empty threat. Yeah, there's prosecutorial discretion, but  I can see the SEC going after significant purchasers, by arguing they are underwriters who flip tokens to the general public.

That's going to be a massive tax bomb if it's going to be a sale to get you through retirement (assuming united states)

Generally, like any other investment. If you have any gains and convert it back into dollars, it's usually taxable. If you have losses, it's usually deductible. An undecided question is whether you realize (taxable) income when you exchange your appreciated coins for a substantially similar asset (other coins). This is not tax advice.

I don't think they are fungible at all. Ethereum is a separate product. Wall Street firms value Ethereum because of its potential use cases and lesser degree of decentralization.
