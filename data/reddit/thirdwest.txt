What was the cutoff volume to make the list?

Can you clarify for me exactly how the mining in secrecy works?  I understand that any POW's that meet the side chain difficulty can just be kept private until they are all released at once.  But what about the POW's that meet the main chain difficulty.  Surely the miner is not going to forgo Bitcoin mining rewards and must publish those blocks.  Won't it be possible to identify from those blocks that they are actually merge mining on the side chain despite their prior claims not to be (since they have to include the hash of the side chain block)?

Excellent response Erik!  I think they owe you an an article that properly articulates what we're trying to accomplish with Bitcoin.

If you're from WV, please let Senator Manchin know you totally disagree with his position on this.   In the end, congressmen exist to serve the interests of their constituency.  Let's let Senator Manchin know the people of WV don't want to ban Bitcoin.

I think this is great news really.  It's not about the rules for the protocol or the regulations/law surrounding Bitcoin.  It's about finding a safe harbor for the banks that want to take on Bitcoin businesses as customers.  They want to come up with a framework that protects them from their regulators if they're ensuring certain AML and KYC procedures in their Bitcoin clients.  That's a big step forward from right now where most banks just don't want to run the risk.

I'm sorry, but this just doesn't sound authentic to me.

If you find or create a design document that makes it a bit easier to understand the overall architecture, it would certainly be a valuable thing to share.

How would that work?  The whole beauty of Uber is you don't have to issue a payment after the ride, they already have everything on file.   Likewise the drivers don't have to worry about you not paying.

I'm not sure we can celebrate when we're still 10 places behind birdswitharms.  Apparently I don't spend enough time on the internet.
