Soooo.... guard your keys *and* if you entrust a third-party with a 2 of 3 ... AUDIT their ITSec and/or buy some liability insurance

Trezor is open source, but doesn't have a secure element.
Ledger has a secure MCU but therefore can't opensource the firmware.
Keepkey is a Trezor copy.
Bitbox ( is fully open source, has a secure element to store the secrets and is Swiss made. They need to work on their marketing.

Me and my phone walk down Main Street in Smallville ... the Telco knows who and where I am ... I consent to having *really relevant* advertising served to me, but I want to be paid for it via Bitcoin.
    
Unlike the M-P-W-paywall problem, this seems like a reasonable opportunity for advertisers to pursue ... no ?

FedEx International Priority 1-3day depending on where in the world ... that said Trezor &amp; Ledger also charge similar (more ?) for the same service.
FWIW - if you hold a meaningful amount of BTC do these prices and shipping costs really impact your buying decision ?   Really ? &lt;/serious&gt;

Without malice, with all due respect and please do remember, I’m nobody … I wanted to share my personal opinion on the situation in which Coinbase finds itself. For the foreseeable future, there is neither IPO nor trade sale in sight — survival will mean generating operating profit or demonstrating to future investors strong *growth* and positioning the company as a sector leader. We all have a cross to bear this this is yours, in my opinion.
The pursuit of “growth” and “leadership” coupled with a limited time horizon is in my opinion the lens that allows me to best understand your blog and twitter posts including the one above.
FWIW, there is trouble on the horizon, but it’s not the “interesting failure” you identify above; the miners are certainly capable of financial and operational planning. Not one will wait until the halving before acting. They have their forecasts with the halving baked in since a while. How could it be otherwise?

Gents - as junseth's legal and financial advisor, I'd like to bring you're (the collective you) attention to the fact that this reddit forum (nor slack FTM) is not the best forum for this discussion.
u/wbnns - do contact [21.co/dario]( to remedy this situtation.

I can help a bit. 
The date &amp; time of the transaction are under the gent's thumb :(
There is a 6% fee and a circa 2.5% spread on BTC.
The BTC requires the customer to enter his/her Swiss mobile phone number so Sweepay can send a code to confirm and close the loop.
All mobile SIM sales in Switzerland require an ID check.

Hi - I read somewhere that Ledger had done 50k during the first 3yrs ... now 1mn ... THAT'S HUGE 
that's 5'000 units per day coming out of your offices (I've seen your videos - *nice*)
possible ?
plausible ?
