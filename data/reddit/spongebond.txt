I heard this is just a popular way for russian officials to launder money. "All this money came to me by the way of investing into bitcoin 5 years ago!" kind of thing.

If you do nothing, your bitcoins are safe. But you essentially will have "extra" additional BCC coins which you could sell for little profit. People predict that BCC with tank to $0, but who knows. So, you do nothing, you get all your coins + BCC, then BCC devalues, and you're left with your "original" coins.

Grandstanding. Putin going for isolation, but he has to control all his oligarch minions who love US and EU. As citizens do too. Putin will be gone sooner or later.

I'm unsure to be honest, I just follow what veterans approved.

You won't see it in your current electrum wallet unfortunately. That's why to redeem BCC you'll need to follow these instructions.

This interview was hilarious. BCH guy saying Bitcoin is controlled by globalists, Jones loves it. Callers keep calling and calling-out BCH guy, Jones gets a headache trying figure this shit out LOL
Just as a matter of optics entire interview looked like "shady shit on top of shady shit" haha

Hold on. Even clearer plan: 1. Fork happens. 2. Get new electrum wallet (this is a regular wallet, NOT Bitcoin Cash wallet). Transfer everything to new (regular) wallet with a new seed. 3. Wait for transfer confirmations. 4. Get Bitcoin Cash wallet that supports BCC. Use your old seed in BCC wallet. 
This is how I understood it. Hope it helps.

Jesus hentai christ, all these wallet politics. Here's the relevant part:
How to redeem my BCC?
BCC wallets will require you to import your seed or your private keys,
which can be exported from Electrum. Doing so will expose all your
Bitcoin funds associated with that seed to the BCC wallet you decide
to use.
Therefore, *after* the BCC fork, but *before* you enter a seed or
private key in a BCC wallet, you should move all your funds to a new
Electrum wallet, with a new seed. You will still be able to use the
old seed or private key with BCC, because BCC has replay
protection. Wait until your funds are confirmed in your new Bitcoin
wallet, before you enter the old private key in a BCC wallet. This
will protect your BTC funds from rogue/untrusted software.

Oh, rock on! Thanks for linking official plan.

This is **literally actually** how I feel right now: 
So main question now: Do I move wallets before or after folk? Isn't today the worst day to move? And I'm at work now D: FML.

Alright awesome, this makes sense. Thank you for clarifying!!

I'm not a rocket optometrist, but here's my step by step plan:
1. Fork happens.
2. Get new electrum wallet. Transfer everything to new wallet with a new seed.
3. Wait for transfer confirmations.
4. Get wallet that supports BCC. Use your old seed there.
Bam, you have coins in both wallets.... ? Can veterans confirm?!
