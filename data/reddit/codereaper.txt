I agree with that 100%, but if such a tiny percentage of payments fall through, than it's still mostly a minor issue. Definitely needs direct refund though.

I've bought several laptops, games, and other goods on Overstock with Bitcoin and had zero hassle about it. I think this is a tiny mistake in the large run of it, and Overstock is pretty reliable.

For the sake of decentralization. Bitcoin was made to be decentralized, and CEX.io is making itself the central Bitcoin miner, and the possibility of being bribed into doing a 51% attack is there, or hacked even. We need to keep Bitcoin decentralized.

There are postives and negatives to deflationary currency, as presented by the different schools of economics, but one thing that doesn't apply in any legitimate field of study is "common sense." People try to argue against experts by using common sense arguments all too often, because common sense sounds nice, despite being false. For example, one poster in the conspiracy subreddit a few months ago argued that scientists were lying about objects being mostly empty space because we'd just fall through them then. That sounds nice to people who know nothing about basic physics, but by learning just a tiny bit we know that objects are held appart by forces and not by direct contact (as it appears to our eyes.) In the same vain, arguing "but it goes UP IN VALUE" is a common sense argument that doesn't apply to actual economic theory. No expert in economics would ever use that argument to justify deflation, even if they were defending deflation.

Yes, it IS an absurd idea, I agree. Mocking ideas does nothing to help people understand reality, though. Instead of saying a sarcastic remark ending in "amirite" as though that proves something, point out the flaws in the argument, refer to Austrian Economics, etc. Putting someone down for their ideas instead of actually debating them just encourages them to think that people with your ideas (even if they are right) are assholes and it gives them incentive to cling to their ideas, however misguided. On the other hand, calm and rational debate can win over people willing to hear the other side. I have no issue with disagreeing with the sentiment of that poster, I only have an issue with mocking an argument instead of debating it.

Right, because there's definitely no way for meth to be used [responsibly.]( And following your logic that a drug that is dangerous to others should be illegal, alcohol would be the first thing to be thrown out the window - and we all know how great the Prohibition worked!  
  
Point is, drugs are dangerous, yes, but violent cartels and gangs are more dangerous, and DNMs are a more peaceful solution to the illicit sale of drugs, making things *better* not *worse.*

Trying to get rid of the good old metric system, shame on you! MilliBTC is a precise unit that tells you the amount of bitcoin, it shouldn't be done away with for the sake of catchiness. I already don't like the "bit," which should be called the microBTC. The satoshi is a really icky amount, also, at ten nanoBTC, instead of being 0.000000001 BTC and thus one nanoBTC.

I got my bitcoins at less than 500 USD a long time ago and hodled them so this is still smooth sailing. Great time to buy though - wish I could right now.

I have impeccable timing, apparently - I have an account there, largely inactive for a year, and decided to give my info in order to withdraw my bitcoins exactly one day prior to getting the email that they were shutting down.

I got about 4 when they were worth between 200 USD and 500 USD but yeah, should have got more too. : /

Lol implying that it's literally inevitable to use a drug irresponsibly despite it being used medicinally in some contexts.

My close relative used meth in college. (Spoiler: he's a professor now.) Also: anecdotal evidence is the scientific equivalent of children arguing "But my mom said..." and has NO value except personally. The empirical study of meth lead even the FDA to classify is as Schedule Two... not One. Schedule Two means the drug is dangerous, yes, but it still has medical value. And before you argue that the FDA is unreliable because they made marijuana Schedule One, remember that public hysteria about drugs always creates *more* regulation, not *less,* meaning that public hysteria about meth would place it in an incorrectly controlling category than it belongs in, meaning it is *less* dangerous than it is scheduled as, not *more.*  
  
Now please do continue building strawmen out of anecdotal evidence and then *oh so savagely* burning them down with faulty logic.

Yeah. I just expected my bitcoins to hold value, and instead they nearly quintupled in USD equivalent! Bitcoin is always able to spring back from major setbacks anyway, and this setback is a fairly normal one, not a major one. Exciting stuff!

I bought a lot of steam keys for ~0.05 in mid-2016 totaling something like 0.5-0.7 BTC - which I could now buy a damn great computer with. Luckily, I saved ~4.6 BTC, and the price increased significantly since I first got them. Also, I used to give loans on BTCJam, and two of my debtors defaulted - the amount of bitcoin was significant (~0.9 BTC) but the current USD amount is not significant enough to be worth hiring a lawyer to help enforce the arbitration, and the legal deadline comes soon.
