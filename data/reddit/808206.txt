I've always thought the rush towards mass adoption was "wrong" and pushed too heavily, too quickly.
I definitely want others to use Bitcoin, and have done what I can to speak to others about it. But it (Bitcoin) is just not ready for everyone.
I think trying to hard to get "the man on the street" to understand and fully embrace Bitcoin in its current iteration is not the right approach.

You can't say for certain that it "never happen" just because the press hasn't revealed the evidence.
It is completely possible that during their investigation and arrest of this man that they were able to seize BTC.
@_date: 2018-05-28 13:05:34
Whenever I see this I'm reminded that Bitcoin is already doing so much. The price might not be going crazy like a lot of us would like it to, but things are happening.
Bitcoin is being developed, it's being invested in. Smart people are currently working on solutions, on innovations. The suits, whether we like it or not, are interested. They're trying to work within the ecosystem, they're getting involved.
Things are happening. Bitcoin is doing stuff. "HODL", at least to me, does not just mean hold on to your coins. It means hold your position, hold your horses. Have patience. Keep living your life, keep buying Bitcoin, have a pint, and wait for all this Bitcoin Boredom to blow over.

Regardless of what this guy did or did not do, it's still possible. People ARE that stupid. Which is what I've been saying this whole time.

Regardless, it is still within the realm of possibility that his phrase and key were easily found.
Also, it appears they weren't able to seize all of it. I'd love to know the actual evidence and details.
@_date: 2018-05-28 14:29:05
No, it has been in a steady decline after the extremely large spike late last year. I've been around long enough to not feel like this is any different that what has happened in the past.

@_date: 2018-05-27 11:50:57
Its not a concern of mine either, because I properly store and secure my BTC.
What I am saying is that it is a general concern regarding BTC storage and security. A general rule concerning Bitcoin security is to safely store your private keys so they are not lost or stolen. Some people dont, making it possible  for them to lose their Bitcoin or have it stolen. 
@_date: 2018-05-18 12:39:17

You are completely ignoring the fact that the owner does not have to "give consent". Wallet keys have been stored in plain text files, they can be incredibly easy to seize. Granted, I don't know if this is what happened in this particular case. But to suggest that it isn't possible is hogwash.
As far as the media is concerned, I disagree that they are telling "lies" just because they don't provide every single bit of proof tied to a case. Personally, I'd love to see the proof. But you can't completely discredit an article or story solely based on the fact that they don't publish the evidence.

Guy gets arrested. His computer is seized by the government. They inspect his computer and find a wallet key. They move the BTC from his wallet to their own. At that point, how has the BTC not been seized?
@_date: 2018-05-27 10:44:15
Do you really believe that BTC cannot be hacked or stolen or seized? Preposterous.
@_date: 2018-05-27 10:00:19
I completely disagree. Assets, digital photos, computers, food, etc. are all things that can be seized. Whomever controls the keys to a Bitcoin wallet controls the Bitcoin. If the keys are obtained off a computer that has been seized by the law, then they have seized the BTC.
@_date: 2018-05-27 11:44:39
Maybe. Its just arguing semantics at that point. Perhaps "seized control of" is a better phrase.
@_date: 2018-05-27 10:06:02
I did not say "hacked or infected his computer with stealing code". Where are you getting this from? He is arrested. His computer is "seized" in the very common legal sense. His wallet keys could have been easily found on his computer and the BTC are seized.
Again, I don't know if this is how it happened in this particular case, but you're a moron if you can't see how this is completely possible.
@_date: 2018-05-03 06:07:39
lol, this is great.
@_date: 2018-05-27 09:24:19
Fair point, these BS articles are ridiculous. But...


Did anyone here suggest otherwise? This is exactly what happens when BTC are "seized" in the legal sense. 
@_date: 2018-05-27 10:17:20
It's completely within the realm of possibility. Many people keep their private keys in plain text. You're claiming that "BTC can't be seized", and I'm providing a very possible scenario in which it can be. I don't understand why you're so convinced that BTC can't be easily stolen or seized.
@_date: 2018-05-27 12:02:18
No. Just because I properly store my Bitcoin doesn't mean its not possible that others may not properly store their own. You're being completely  irrational.
It's entirely possible for someone to improperly  store their private keys leading to loss or theft.

I don't mean hack the encryption, and I certainly didn't suggest that I am able to do any of these things. I meant, a computer can be "hacked" into, wallet.dat files can be recovered, private keys CAN be found in plain text (ITS COMPLETELY POSSIBLE).
Stolen - keylogger? I'm simply talking about wallet and private keys being found on devices that have been stolen. A phone is lost and found or stolen, and the private keys are found. At that point the thief can easily move the BTC to a wallet that they control. It's a very common security concern. It is actively suggested that you DO NOT keep your private keys in plain text; because PEOPLE DO, an their BTC are at risk. It is a completely possible and realistic concern.
You can argue semantics about the word "seized", but it can absolutely apply to BTC being recovered and then controlled by someone other than the original owner.

I can't help but believe that people who ridicule Bitcoin really just don't have an understanding about how it works. I believe they actually think of Bitcoins as the money equivalent of Facebook Likes or upvotes on Reddit.

Regarding the question of "What is the biggest hesitation?" for people that aren't on board yet, I would have liked him to say something along the lines of "they don't understand it yet." I truly think that once you understand what Bitcoin is and how it works, you can't help but be a believer.

Because that would follow having some inside knowledge that the current price is the top of the bubble, knowledge that which OP has not claimed to have.

Thanks, ! I love them delicious bits!
I'm putting these into a special wallet, one that I won't open for 10 years. Perhaps some day in the future we can go to lunch, my treat!

"I got my 9mm" sounds cooler than "my point two seventy inches gun."

Also, the person spending this bill is actually using it to buy the proverbial coffee, while the Bitcoin dork continues to hodl onto its own weenie.

"Nothing to do whatsoever" is simply untrue. Hyperbole. All the liberals I know essentially fit the description. How is that cynical?
@_date: 2018-04-09 01:32:48
I have kind of a "stupid" question. Can someone from out of state/country use these BTC ATM's?
I live in Hawaii where exchanges like Coinbase are not allowed to do business. Will be traveling this summer and would love to hit up one of these machines.
@_date: 2018-04-13 12:09:56
I'm not arguing that "conservatives" don't believe in civil rights, I was pointing out how your assertion that "everyone" believes in civil rights is delusional.
@_date: 2018-04-07 11:28:29
Fucking fascinating. Thank you!

So many "shoulda's" though, didn't always have a lot to invest. Cool pins, by the way!

Really? I mean, handle your OPSEC however you want, but certainly you must understand the concept of keeping your finances private. Would you tell a bunch of strangers on the street how much cash you had in your wallet? It's the same concept.
@_date: 2018-04-10 08:35:02
Congrats on your milestone. Pretty great to hear. The stickers look cool, too! Bitcoin!
@_date: 2018-04-13 11:46:54


You are delusional if you believe this.
Again, no one I know believes "Bezos should buy Twitter." or any of this other nonsense. You're lumping a whole group of people together with a small bunch of nuts. Would it be fair if I blamed all "conservatives" every time some extremist calls for "liberals to be cured with a 9mm" ?
Also, naming a bunch of websites (??) does not prove any point you're trying to make.
@_date: 2018-04-13 08:58:20


I'm a "modern Liberal" and I'm none of the things you describe. I'm not a communist, either. You're wrong about all of that. You're also wrong if you think shooting "Liberals" is going to "cure" anything.
@_date: 2018-04-18 15:27:12
There was that one time I so badly wanted a beef burrito and couldn't find a place that would trade me one for Bitcoin. Pretty much a huge failure right there.

This is one of the higher goals Ive seen so far this week. So yes, let us go with this one.

Yay! Bitcoins!
@_date: 2018-04-07 11:29:11
Yup. I haven't kept up with every theory or whatever, but this is definitely the most solid case I've read yet. Fascinating stuff.

70BTC after Moon is potentially a whole different beast.

It's such a weak angle to try to take against Bitcoin. It seems desperate. Like if a vegetarian tried to argue against meat eating because "what about all the propane use from the GRILLS!"
@_date: 2016-07-15 12:17:15
Right on, Andreas. Very excited to hear what you two have to say about bitcoin.

Bitcoin is also used to:
* Buy drugs
* Buy sandwiches
* Pay employees
Furthermore: It's so complicated, it could be used for terrorism.

You mean rocket boosters into space?
@_date: 2013-11-20 07:05:32
Yes! A sizeable discount for Bitcoin purchases is ideal during this (still) early adoption phase. It benefits both the consumer and the vendor.
@_date: 2013-04-06 09:28:07
Looks great, but a larger size would make it way better.

This. Call your city officials and explain to them what is going on, why it is wrong, and what you think should be done.
Call the media and let them know you're waiting for your response from the Mayor on why blankets are being taken away from homeless people.

Bitcoin first intrigued me as a vendor because of the low fees. Compared to the merchant fees paid to the major credit card companies, Bitcoin is leaps and bounds less expensive. It's only a matter of time before more retailers adopt it.
