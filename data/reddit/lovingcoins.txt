Sucks that its more like a "walk people through buying process" than promote your affiliate link. Hopefully in the future they will an affiliate program in which you get an unique link and anyone that sign up and buy one Robocoin using your link gets you those lovely Bitcoin.

Ohhh no I dont know of any at the moment. I did a quick research and didn't find but one and it looked really scammy.

I'm not sure am understanding your question =(, what I meant to say is that they referral program is more for people that do walk in and talk to potential clients instead of the old ref people using your ref link and they'd closed the sale.

Yes, you can set multiple alarms each time the value goes up or below your desire value. Its call Bitcoin Checker, and the logo is a green shield with the B.

Those lottos are just pure gambling and I personally think that people that constantly waste money on lottery tickets are silly. With Bitcoin at least you know or have better changes of making a good profit doesn't matter if it is within months or years. I won't lie I'm not buying Bitcoins because its innovative and what not, all I care about is making a profit. You see people here saying "I couldn't care less about the price blah blah" and then panic sell.
Of course there are those people that are truly loyal the currency and idea, but saying you don't care about the price when deep down you know you do is absurd. I bought my first .8btc for $800, went to one of those casinos and build my balance up to 1.48btc and then exchanged it for 4.5k Quarks,  if everything goes to the ground I couldn't care less, unlike some people I didn't invest more than what I was willing to lose.
Some people sold at $900, others at $1k+, and others were thinking "it will go higher I wl just wait some more" and now those are panic selling at a loss. Greed is our worse enemy, each time that I gamble I ways want more and more and then see myself on the edge of losing everything. If the price keep going down I will keep buying coin by coin because I know that soon or later I will make my money back.

I thought Coinbase was the safest way to buy for USA residents since BTC-e dont have payment processors for us, beside Wire transfers. Could you recommend a good provider?

Best of lucks in your current and future ventures!

Feeling really good right now, I went back to the stupid casino with .5BTC and earned all my money back plus some profit in less than 30 minutes, .3BTC+, needless to say I will stay away from it and any other form of gambling. I won all my money back but almost lost my .5BTC once again o_O
