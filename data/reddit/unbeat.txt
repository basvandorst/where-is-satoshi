I made a new network called speed of light network, instantly transfer money across the world peer 2 peer in less than .001 seconds. It’s not with bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-11-14 13:16:55
And if I don’t give up your wallet Your good as dead
@_date: 2017-11-11 21:05:11
It’s well adopted already, that’s the most important part 
@_date: 2017-11-12 16:04:17
yah the price dropping then the Cashers CEOs selling out
@_date: 2017-11-12 21:20:37
it's like another attack just like yesterday, except now even during the adjustments 
@_date: 2017-11-24 01:10:50
Lol Roger Ver is robbing you enjoy thanksgiving
@_date: 2017-11-11 12:12:08
All altcoins claim to have better technology than bitcoin, yet bitcoin continues to stay strong.
@_date: 2017-11-14 13:16:13
If I was part of the government why would I create my own coin when I can just get the military and take over the mines and wallet of each individual and Toss them in jail forever
@_date: 2017-11-12 18:44:48
They will be back, the only way to stop them is remove them from the real world
@_date: 2017-11-11 13:40:43
At the end no merchants accept bitcoin cash and they have no atm machines 
@_date: 2017-11-24 19:24:34
Will never reach that with thousands of other coins and hard forks coming up. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 14:16:09
BITCOIN GIGAFACTORY LETS GET IT STARTED
@_date: 2017-11-14 12:37:44
Like I've posted in the past. Miners control bitcoin now, but the government with guns will control the miners. REMEMBER THAT
@_date: 2017-11-12 17:52:13
History shows weapons decide the fate of each country
@_date: 2017-11-11 21:07:45
U gonna keep adopting a new coin every time it adds something different? Then you’ll never have a stable currency for the rest of your life
@_date: 2017-11-12 17:51:36
Killing and taking over miners can't stop it?
@_date: 2017-11-14 02:10:34
Just google Roger Ver and look under Wikipedia for conspiracy
@_date: 2017-11-12 21:19:38
money flowing out of BTC is not good for BTC and the entire market
@_date: 2017-11-12 21:17:07
market instability. when 2 major platforms on the same algo
@_date: 2017-11-12 20:14:24
it should adjust gradually?
@_date: 2017-11-12 17:09:23
if bitcoin gets too big, miners won't be around for too long when militarize governments walk in with guns blazing
@_date: 2017-11-03 13:50:02
I’m asking someone to come build it
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:23:54
All they have to do is block the exchanges, going to have difficulty moving money back to a country you live in if you can’t convert to your own FIAT currency
@_date: 2018-02-04 15:33:48
His name is Elliot aka Mr. Robot
@_date: 2017-10-15 16:32:32
Then I’d take those overinflated bitcoins and convert them to another countries currency and buy whatever I want 
@_date: 2017-10-16 16:30:52
Because warren buffet said so
@_date: 2017-10-15 15:29:37
But it wouldn’t matter anyways if there’s less buying power with that fiat currency since because a government can create unlimited amounts 
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:33:03
I have a massive tax write off for previous losses so I can help 
@_date: 2017-10-15 16:30:18
Why would the government suffer they already holding the bitcoins lol
@_date: 2017-09-15 11:22:45
Exited going back to the stock market
@_date: 2017-10-16 00:08:29
Do it you can’t lose money in bitcoin
@_date: 2017-10-15 16:28:56
Yah bitcoin sky rockets but it’s due to fake money being pumped into it
@_date: 2017-10-15 15:32:49
Even if it cost 1 million usd to buy a bitcoin, if I have unlimited USD I can buy as much bitcoin as I want in theory
@_date: 2017-09-15 11:22:45
Exited going back to the stock market
@_date: 2017-10-15 16:10:31
Everything wouldn’t be inflated only bitcoin and the country that did it would be destroyed. All other countries wouldn’t just accept that countries currency or bitcoin since it’s been compromised
@_date: 2017-10-15 14:17:28
Well unlimited purchasing power to bitcoin
@_date: 2017-10-15 16:16:17
I’ve done virtual currency since 1999 and from what I recalled it didn’t work out well
@_date: 2017-10-23 00:14:34
All bitcoin miners in China will have unlimited cash, back to centralized life
@_date: 2017-10-15 16:42:22
Who cares if his country collapses he’s got bitcoins that can be converted to any currency at a high price. He’s the ruler of the world
@_date: 2017-10-15 14:11:28
But if one small government can print unlimited cash and buy bitcoins... then essentially they have unlimited bitcoins
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:36:34
I can write off about 10 million dollars in losses first come first serve
@_date: 2017-10-15 15:47:26
But bitcoin prices would be inflated as well by a corrupt government, so wouldn’t it make bitcoin also worthless?
@_date: 2017-10-15 16:26:49
That logic doesn’t make any sense to me. It goes back to my initial theory that if a corrupt government printed its unlimited currency and converted it to bitcoin it would compromise bitcoin for everyone
@_date: 2017-07-16 19:11:49
Bitcoin is going back to 200 dollars
@_date: 2017-07-16 19:29:02
$200 dollars just watch
@_date: 2017-07-16 19:20:09
This is going down to $200
