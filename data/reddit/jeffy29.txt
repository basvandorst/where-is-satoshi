Dear Grandma in Korea: You can come and take the bitcoins from my cold dead hands. I'm not selling!

Yeah but that's something those awful bankers made up, if you keep believing in magic coins they will deliver forever and ever.

Well, technically 99% of bitcoins will be mines by 2032 so fee market  will happen lot sooner, but even then nobody was thinking it would be at the current level of absurdity. To send my ~$10 from Coinbase left I would need to pay $31 right now, 12 hours ago it was $34. Just fees.

Though I am sure Baron Trump owns plenty of bitcoins, with his Cyber skills and all.

1TB blocks? What are you smoking? Just to scale to the level of Visa, 1GB blocks would be plenty enough and by the time 1TB blocks are required, it would be very very far into the future and 1TB wouldn't even seem like a lot. Hardware is progressing much faster than what Bitcoin needs or will need.
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:39:41
Absolutely, which is why anyone sensible has been already disclosing and paying capital gains taxes on Bitcoin already. This move further legitimizes and promotes digital currency by treating it as any other commodity but this sub (of course) typical reactionary fashion and greed is blindly outraged again. 
Being seen as legitimate doesn't always come with upsides.

Because fuck people who were doing something productive in their life in 2009 instead of looking at obscure conspiracy ridden websites, right? Fuck all the people who have not been born yet.
Oh yeah that reminds me of different system that works in the same way, land. Oh your grandpa didn't buy an acre for a nickle 60 years ago? Sorry that land is now worth 5mil, fuck you stupid millenials, stop complaining about price of housing.
That's the thing about digital space, we can't make more earth but we absolutely can change the rules of digital things.

Yep this, of course they were making insider trading but it's bitcoin/altcoin so nobody cares. These exchanges affect the price in a giant way.

What FUD? Mainstrean lay media are hyping bitcoin while when I go to transfer $10 worth of Bitcoin from Coinbase (they gave it to me for free with new account), the fee is $24 lol. That's the real problem lol, not some fucking FUD.
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:57:10
It is technically correct but not really, rate new bitcoins is slowing down (by design), 80% has already been mined, by 2030 99% will be mined and by 2040 99.9% will be mined, next 100y will be spent on mining 0.1%. So yeah mining itself will be largely dead by 2030-40 and miners will need to rely on feed to be able to sustain verification process. There are far more comprehensive explanations in this sub, look it up.

Funny how Satoshi himself [believed in bigger blocks]( yet reddit experts are doing whatever gymnastics they can to stay on $30 fees. Enjoy banks running all the sidechains without which the whole network will collapse.

Blockstream controls the reference design, everyone else is irrelevant if Blockstream is the only one who decides what goes into BTC.


And you know, Gavin Anderson, Mike Hearn and other core developers who got kicked out by Blockstream.

Personally, when he came second time to JRE podcast and Joe asked him about recent Bitcoin problems (mt gox and others), he was excusing it by saing how all the banks have have same thing and banks caused recessiom and banks stole billions from people etc - what the hell does that have to do with anything? 
It's been two months and I forgot most of the podcast but I distinctly remember being annoyed by him when he defended bitcoin by shifting the blame instead of admitting some of the weaknesses of bitcoin and if it can be fixed. I guess what I am trying to say is that he came off as too much of a fanboy instead of someone interested in bitcoin like in the first podcast.

If something has perceived value than it's a form of money, otherwise I would be "buying" my coke with art paintings.

And there was a perfect guy to put him instead of the MTGox guy - few weeks ago some idiot here was arguing that some bitcoins have more value than the others and someone is going to make a killing after buying federal auctioned bitcoins, even if they pay more than the market price - wish I could find the thread.

The fact that they forgot to bring the second belt and scrabbled it right during the speech made the moment even sweeter.

I knew about bitcoin when it was at $12, I thought "Should I invest $1000? Nah, it will crash and burn". Fuck me.

"10k is a base because hodlers will always buy it at that!"
Not for nothing, this will at least clean up lot of self professed crypto trade experts who know jack shit about markets or economics. It's not hard to look smart during bull market.

Is there a sub or a place where I can go to know what is currently happening? I was randomly checking bitcoin github and looked up the current price and saw a spike, but when I check here the front page is full of shit memes and people in comments talking in almost religious way. Does this place have any moderation? Doesn't look like it.

The old veteran conman, the young fat (and totally not hairpiece wearing) hero and suave conman focusing on old ladies. Add a female who is totally out of our hero's league and token minority and you have yourself a classic Hollywood "romcom". BitConned maybe?

Currency can only function when there is a "limitless" supply and currency is being constantly (albeit at very small speed) devalued. All worlds civilizations and nations have ran on this principle naturally since the beginning of human time. 
When you have limited supply of something, it forces the behaviour of not investing, because your thing (be it bitcoin, van gogh art or limited edition star wars release) will always increase in value because new value is being created but the supply is the same. 
While in regular cash where more gold can always (not infinite but you know what I mean) be mined and more paper can always be printed. Which has effect of pushing people to constantly investing because holding their money will achieve nothing.
Bitcoin is very interesting technology but fundamentally flawed and economy running purely on bitcoin would function very badly. 
Everyone is still mocking the guy who spent 12k bitcoin or so on a pizza, but that is a problem, this whole monstrosity of human civilization and all the inventions and progress is built on constant investment and risk taking. Hodling is exactly the opposite effect you want for an economy to function and adapt fast.
Limited supply massively rewards early adopters while someone at the bottom has no way of reaching them. What other natural limited supply currency you can name? It's right under you, land and resources. All the other "early adopters" are massively benefiting because their grandpa bought a farm or drilled oil for a nickle while rest us chumps are living in small apartments. Human civilization works well on inflation while it creates massive inequality and scarcity on deflation.
Look at businesses, almost all are massive old companies that were rich when you were born and will be once you die. You can't start a startup to drill oil lol. Except one major industry - technology. Technology has limitless supply because all you need is a smart person with pen and paper. Elon Musk comes from middle class family from South Africa, now he is one of the richest people in the world. 
Bitcoin inflation right now is 4% which is a healthy number, but every halving it will get worse.
Jesus christ this was way longer than I wanted to make it. So yeah, Bitcoin is a very interesting technology, but I don't think economy will be able to function on it. Bitcoin will function as a means of currency transaction, but 90% will always stay as a means of speculation and nothing else because of the flaw in design.
edit: I forgot to mention, permanent loss of bitcoins is also a big problem, even at this point it's like 1mil+1mil by Satoshi. Even I mined like 0.0001 couple of years and then threw it away because I forgot during reinstalling, that money is gone forever. Terrorist attacks on servers of large exchanges could literally start a recession.
@_date: 2017-10-18 15:37:18
Because land and natural resources, just like bitcoin is a limited supply currency. We can't change the nature of land and natural resources, but bitcoin adopters want to do that same for the money, which would create even more inequality.
The true decentrelized digital currency will be one with limitless supply and inflationary system, one day maybe someone will figure out how to do that.

Ding ding ding, that's why in nearly all good (and most bad) economies of the world, central bank is semi-independent. Because you would get plenty of demagogues getting elected on platform of "free printed money for everyone!".
Bitcoin does not have president per say but will of the crowd has essentially the same effect, what's the few million spent on astroturfers when you can make billions selling them a scam, plenty of companies here tried.
@_date: 2018-02-06 15:07:39
Because without regulations the market gets flooded with lot of scams, it creates artificial bubbles which hurt the entire market. You prevent scam exchanges from and prevent critical things like Tether having absolutely no oversight.
And you don't even need to have governmental organization, it can be non profit with governmental observers. ICANN has functioned like that for very long time with no issues. Even small things like Ethereum platform allowing only exchanges which meet certain criteria to trade with their coins, would go a long way towards stabilizing the market.
