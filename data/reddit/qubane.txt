The tulip mania again! Never gets old.
@_date: 2018-01-30 20:11:48
A small clarification: new backups after every 'addwitnessaddress' are only necessary for the wallet to recognize these addresses as part of the wallet. It's still possible to restore from an old backup and re-create the segwit addresses simply by using 'addwitnessaddress' again. So don't panic if you used this in the past without updating your backups :)

Many things. The selling point of Ethereum however is that it's "willing to move fast and break things" to compensate for its shortcomings over time, which means regular hardforks for everything, from bailing out failed smart contracts to difficulty bombing miners to venture into the unknown that is PoS etc.
That's all good and fine, and works well enough as long as we're talking about a small niche project. But nobody in their right mind would want to become dependent on something as unpredictable and unproven as Ethereum. Buterin's central position in all of this doesn't help either. And no, Microsoft and others aren't building stuff on Ethereum, they're simply using the same code base.  The only people who don't care about any of this are the ones who create vaporware ICO's for quick profits. For that, as well as for gambling or something like cryptokitties, Ethereum is perfectly fine... if Buterin's plan to scale it actually works that is.
And all that said, that's not even the main issue why I wouldn't invest in Ethereum. The main reason is that having a completely separate platform like that for smart contracts is inefficient and unnecessary. The future of things like that will be built on top of a single secure blochain, everything else makes no sense. And that blockchain very much looks to be Bitcoin.

@_date: 2017-12-21 15:35:55
The 0.15.1 release was planned to be the release that implements full Segwit support in the wallet. But then the whole 2X thing happened, and the devs had to use their time and ressources to make sure that the network isn't going to get disrupted by the 2X nodes going live. This was necessary because the 2X guys refused to implement proper mechanisms that would have made the fork go smoothly for both sides, either because of incompetence or because of intentional malice. And that's why we don't have full Segwit support in Core yet.

If people actually understood what they're buying, and used just a little bit of common sense, then most "cryptos" wouldn't have much value at all.
But that's not what's happening right now. Instead people are buying everything that looks like it could be the next big thing. Doesn't matter much what the real value propositions are, or if the fundamentals make any sense at all, or if there are actual use-cases for the things they are buying that go beyond speculation. All you need is a white paper full of technobabble and buzz words, a good marketing budget to create enough hype, and voila, people will buy your tokens and start shilling their new "investment" on social media for you. That's the reality right now, and some might call this a bubble. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 12:57:36


Ethereum already "took off" (at least price wise) this year. It's at 1/4 of Bitcoin's market cap for god's sake. You really shouldn't compare prices of single units of which there can be arbitrarily many. If anything, all things considered, I'd say eth is overvalued right now, and in some kind of ironic twist, it might end up being the actual Myspace of smart contract platform (say hello to Rootstock etc).

Hey wow, I'm a realist too! Looks like we do have something in common.
@_date: 2017-08-10 14:17:17
That little statement sure made you angry.

It's pretty much public knowledge.
@_date: 2017-08-10 14:30:15
Oh, so you're saying it's actually funny *because* Ethereum has no future? Because that's the joke? Okay, sorry for not getting it right away.
@_date: 2017-08-10 15:16:10
That's a completely different statement. Reading comprehension isn't your forte, is it?
@_date: 2017-08-10 15:08:13
Where have I said any of that?
@_date: 2017-08-25 12:33:57
Okay fair enough. I was under the impression that you deliberately created all the segwit utxos just so you can craft this transaction. 
@_date: 2017-08-10 14:51:03
The reasons are manifold. The bottom line is that it has no future. Set a reminder for a year or two or whatever. 
@_date: 2017-08-10 14:48:13

I completely agree with that. I also never pretended that I've given you anything to convince you that Ethereum has no future, because quite frankly, that seems like a lot of effort with very little in it for me. You'll have to educate yourself I guess.
@_date: 2017-08-10 15:07:34
I'll answer it for you: you're here because you're angry when someone tells you that Ethereum has no future, because deep down you know it's true, but you don't want to hear it while you're still financially invested in it. Sorry for making you angry.
@_date: 2017-08-10 15:01:02
That's good. There's no reason to be angry at someone telling you that Ethereum has no future. It is what it is.
@_date: 2017-08-22 14:01:35
Your loosely related but ultimately irrelevant to the point analogies don't change the simple fact that there is no reason not to implement replay protection, other than as an attempted attack on "the other chain". And that's why it should be treated as such.
@_date: 2017-08-22 13:49:30
The status quo is the existing consensus. If you change the existing consensus, then you are the one forking. And if you don't do so responsibly, then you are acting maliciously, especially when it means putting other people's money at risk.
@_date: 2017-08-10 15:52:23
You realize this here takes almost zero effort, and it's at least mildly amusing and a good excuse to procrastinate. While convincing someone like you, who probably doesn't even have the necessary understanding of how any of this works beyond what the price ticker tells him, would take a lot of effort, in return for nothing at all? You do understand that, don't you?
@_date: 2017-08-10 14:33:32
Okay. As long as we agree that Ethereum has no future.
@_date: 2017-08-10 14:54:04
Yes. The difference is that one has a future, and the other one doesn't.
@_date: 2017-08-22 13:59:48
What a convoluted way of bending an argument. The point remains: there is no reason not to implement replay protection, other than as an attempted attack on "the other chain".
@_date: 2017-08-10 15:03:13
I have no idea what you're trying to say, sorry.
@_date: 2017-08-10 14:42:52
Yes. It was born out of the misguided corporate blockchain hype, fueled by a premine funded PR machinery. It has no future, whether you like it or not.
@_date: 2017-08-10 15:40:52
There's no way OP put them next to each other. Nope.

I've said what I've said. You're the one pretending that there's more to it than there is. Ethereum has no future. I know it, other people know it, and deep down you probably know it too. That's all this hilarious thread is about.

So you crafted this huge transaction with tons of inputs (which all had to be sent to segwit addresses beforehand too), just to get a block over 1MB? That seems kind of... pointless.

No, but the irony of a fork that was created to get rid of segwit allowing their users to send their money to segwit addresses despite them not being supported is kind of funny. Why didn't they also update the address version bit, just like bitcoingold did? That would have made this costly mistake impossible.

It's because always buying a fixed amount of 0.1 btc means you invest only a small fiat amount when it's low, but a large fiat amount when price is already high, so the average price of your investment will be relatively high as well.
It would look a lot different if instead of buying 0.1 btc each time, you buy $100 worth instead.

The two blockchains can coexist, just like with Bcash. But users might accidentally transact on the one chain when they think they're transacting on the other chain, because Garzik is being a dick about implementing replay protection (and some other stuff).

There isn't much to watch. Forking in this context means creating a 1:1 copy of both the Bitcoin blockchain and the Bitcoin software, then changing some rules in the software to make it incompatible with the original Bitcoin, then go and run that instead. It's not a big event or anything.
