Maybe, and maybe the person that commented it totally thinks like that. But that's not his/my/your/anyone's place to decide that part of the puzzle.
But a few results of research imply that "prayer" (and well wishing in general) are actually beneficial in a placebo way. Which doesn't necessarily fix the problem, of course..
But hey, it's not like they have anything to offer OP (unless they do, then why tf are you guys praying and not fixing the issue?!?!?!?!), so their words are all they can offer, which will make OP feel better (presumably -- he sounds/seems like a cool guy that appreciates the support regardless of the "source" of their support).

Again, to people who are religious, it's much more important to say "prayers" than just saying "get well, friend". Your views aren't everyone's. Regardless of whether or not a god or gods exist, they feel/believe it/they do, so they're going about it from their perspective. Just do what people say all the time about bitcoin -- zoom out. If people are going to believe in a religion, then there's so much more meaning to them asking their god to help OP than there is in "get well OP"
Edit: Neither "Get well soon" or "Prayers" will fix an issue, right? So what is the point of saying someone should say "Get well soon"? I understand being against various aspects of religions, but who hurt you enough for you to get pissy about "Prayers" while contradicting yourself (You originally pointed out that science will help, words won't) by saying that "Get well soon" is appropriate?

Good look. Petition to meme it?

But these people, with their (presumed) lack of ability to cure his problem, decided that they care enough to pray to their highest order. Even if it's literally just a "Get well soon" to you, to them it's the most they can do without the ability to actually fix the issue.

Careful. With an edge like that, you might cut someone.

But that's the thing. It's just another tool for the same job, I agree. Sure, I would love for everyone to be a little more grounded in their beliefs, but that's not going to happen. The action itself, why does it matter? "Hope all goes well", "Keep you in my thoughts", and "I'll pray for you" are all going to get the same result. It's arguing semantics and it's completely pointless for someone to argue against it if they admit there's no difference between it and other well-wishing phrases other than whether it's religious or not.
It doesn't reveal anything about the person saying it other than that they are religious. As much as we want to correlate it with ignorance or whatever, you can't really say that a religious person is ignorant specifically because they say "I'll be praying for you" when it comes to someone who's legitimately sick. 
And it wouldn't even be worth arguing if it weren't in a thread so serious. It's like making a dark joke at a dark time. Sure, you can do it, but you're just going to look like a dick. The commenter was totally just offering the best they feel they can offer to OP, and then the other guy said "Prayer doesn't do anything, science does."
Which it totally does, but only if they're able to utilize the scientific aspect of it. Otherwise, all they can say is "Hope the best, bud", which he did -- from his own viewpoint.

But neither work, right? What does it matter, the religious connotation? Do you really think that every religious person is harmful to your own personal existence? If so, might I ask why? This is coming from an agnostic who couldn't really care less about religion as a personal practice, but as a firm believer in the existence of perspectives that aren't mine, as long as they're not harmful to me, I will fight to my death for you to preserve that idea.
If you really felt it didn't have any power to the average person, you wouldn't think there was a difference.
I totally get if this person was sick and this other person was like "Repent unless you want to go to hell!", but this is a simple "Prayers, mate,", which holds as much conversational power as "Hope you get better". Has no effect, regardless of the words chosen.
Edit: apologies for getting into that on a post that had nothing to do with religion, OP. I hope the best for you in the immediate and distant future, and wish you peace regardless of the turnout.

You say that, yet even basic needs require some form of monetary payment. Money might not buy happiness, but I know for a fact being unable to buy stuff you want will make you feel worse than having the money. It's about being comfortable and able to not worry. Money does that in numerous ways for people.

Education is expensive af. Clothes can be cheap, sure. Health also gets expensive to take care of. Shelter obviously costs money, too. Transportation as well, with mandatory car insurance and potentially paying to get it fixed if it messes up because you're inevitably trying to pay less for a used car, or car insurance and car payments for a brand new car. Even social skills require a base sum of money. If you don't have access to many of the aforementioned things, you will probably be shunned around those that you require the social skills to survive around.
Money is required in today's life, and you're not going to be happy without it unless you're okay with living off the land (which would be great)
I'm not saying it's not fucked up, but it's the truth. Today's society IS about consumerism, but unless a mass societal paradigm shift occurred, it's not as easy as someone saying "Money doesn't buy happiness!!!!"
Until I'm getting my basic needs for 100% free, money buys happiness. It's not all as black and white as you say. The lack of a car itself can be detrimental to the mental health of someone. Same for social skills, obviously. It's all about maintaining mental health. If you fail to maintain your mental health, you are -- get this -- unhappy. Or in denial. Guess what? Video games don't make many people enjoy their time on Earth, but it does me. As does playing guitar, or driving. All of those cost money. Money might not make *you* happy, but don't speak for everyone else. There are many more needs for the human mind/body than just the four you say.
