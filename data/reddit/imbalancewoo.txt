Yes but most wallets don't recognize bech32 addresses and won't let you send to them.
@_date: 2017-12-05 11:55:03
There are ways to make it so that anyone who wants your coins needs physical access to your keys and hardware wallets make that easy as long as you go through the user manual and FAQ.
You don't need to be a computer science major just to store bitcoins safely.  Sure it will take some studying but it's well worth it.

No, you can send from a bech32 address but most wallets (at least the ones I've used) won't send to a bech32 addresses and say that it's an invalid address.

How can you be sure of this?
@_date: 2017-12-04 01:23:32
I got some tips.
* Test your seed before sending any bitcoins to your Trezor. Wipe the device, start recovery process and set it up again. That way you can be sure the words you wrote down are the ones on your device.
* Use that bloody "Show on TREZOR" button next to your address when you're sending coins.
* Don't wave that seed in front of cameras or input it on any electronic device. Write it down on paper and stamp it on a steel plate. Hackers can't get to those.
These should be just common sense but plenty of people fuck these things up and lose huge amounts of money.

Because you can't be 100% those certain addresses belong to Satoshi. But it is highly likely that they do. This is where the 1 000 000 estimate comes from.
@_date: 2017-12-06 14:37:06
For storing Bitcoins I wouldn't use software wallets at all.

If you're so sure why not go long with 20x leverage on Bitmex or some other margin trading platform?
@_date: 2017-12-04 02:28:21
You wipe a device when it doesn't have any coins on it. Then you plug it in as a "brand new" device and go through this process with the seed it gave you when you first initialized the device. That way you can be sure that the words you wrote down match the key pairs on your device.
* 
Here's about that "Show on TREZOR". It basically makes sure that the address you're sending to is on your device.
* 
Last point about keeping your seed safe should be obvious. Part of what makes Trezor so secure is that your seed is never entered on any computer ever so hackers cannot access it.
Go through this user manual and understand what this device actually does.

At the start block reward was 50BTC per block.
Someone mined 20 000 blocks and has never moved those coins from the addresses they were rewarded to (check the first 20 000 blocks on any block explorer).
People suspect those blocks were mined by Satoshi.

Except it doesn't. Going from 4tx/s to 16, 32 or even 64 does fuck all. Not to mention it wipes most nodes the fuck out forcing the network rely on fewer full nodes making it way easier to attack. So basically you're fucking up everything for no gain whatsoever.
Anyway, love the little concern trolling you got going on here.

Rolling back the chain like DAO? Oh, it's okay when bitcoin does it, right? :) 
@_date: 2017-12-06 19:00:11
That's correct. Exchanges just facilitate selling and buying of bitcoins. Here's a way you can demonstrate bitcoin wallets. 
* Turn off mobile data with airplane mode 
* Generate a wallet in your app of choice (electrum, samourai etc)
* Send BTC to the wallet while your phone is still offline
* Turn connection back on and wait for it to sync
Most people think they need an internet connection or a service like coinbase to create addresses or receive bitcoins.

I'm looking at Bitstamp and on 2011.11.25 it started at $2.5 went all the way to $15 and crashed back to $2.75 so I guess that's the biggest jump percentage wise.

First of all there's no such thing as "ASIC resistant". GPU mining isn't some magical thing that makes your coin immune to developing specialized hardware. It's a dishonest marketing buzzword scammy altcoins use. If someone hasn't developed a specialized device for a task it's just because it's not worth it. If Bitcoin somehow changed its proof of work you'd do this whole thing all over again. Someone develops an ASIC and becomes more efficient than the rest of the market players at manufacturing them. Then everyone else has to catch up and while they're doing it the first player has disproportionate influence over the mining ecosystem.
Second, you want to secure the network with the highest efficiency possible. Why would you want to use devices that perform less hashes resulting in a lower difficulty making the network less secure? That's completely backwards thinking.

You create key pairs in offline environment. If your computer has no way of accessing the internet then no one can remotely steal your private keys.


You just send bitcoins to your address. As simple as that. You can even check the balance of that address on a blockchain explorer like blockchain.info without compromising your private keys.


Your bitcoins are not stored on your hard drive. They don't really even exist anywhere. Blockchain is just a ledger of transfers to different addresses. And to make those transfers you need private keys that match your addresses to sign transactions that you broadcast to the bitcoin network.


Yes and that is why you store your private keys on an offline system so that nobody can get them.


Because online wallets expose your keys to systems that are connected to the internet opening a door for remote attacks.

Miners are mining BCH because they made it much easier to find blocks on their chain, which makes it more profitable but also inflates their currency since block rewards are handed out like candy.
They're going to adjust it soon and miners will come back to Bitcoin chain. 
Not the first time this has happened and everything was fine.

It's a change address. When you make a bitcoin transaction your whole UTXO has to be spent ("check" of bitcoins you received to that address) so Trezor sends the remaining coins to a new address.


Yeah you found a scam that no one has noticed during all these years Trezor has been active. Come on now.

It does help but all you can really do is estimate. At the moment some 10-20sat/B transactions are getting scooped up every block but it could change as soon as you send your transaction.

That's not how it works.
You are free to choose any private key you want. Then your address is derived from that private key. Nobody can stop you from using someone else's private key. They're all out there and available for use. Just pick one and see if it was already in use. :)

It is a USB device that stores your private keys (basically your bitcoins) and signs transactions with them. People use them because malware can't steal your keys from it or spoof transactions as long as you check its screen before you confirm your transaction.

I have never used Breadwallet so I can't say for sure but my guess is that it gives you these 12 or 24 words that you back up on a piece of paper or whatever. It uses those words to generate your private key and address pairs and they are stored only on your device. These words can be used to generate those same keys you use on your phone on pretty much any device. So yes if that is the case then you control your keys.


No. That would defeat the whole purpose of Trezor. Putting old, possibly compromised keys on it is not safe. The device will generate 24 new words and from those it will generate new address and key pairs. You have to move your coins to those addresses. That way they're behind private keys that never leave your Trezor as long as you don't input your seed words anywhere other than paper, which hackers can't access.


Most likely yes. Your coins will be safe as long as you don't move them on EITHER chain (2x or Bitcoin) until it is absolutely certain that replay attacks are no longer a threat and everything has been figured out.

That's a lie. Why would a miner pick up your 0 fee transaction when there are a bunch of people paying to have their bitcoins moved?


3.64 what? 3.64 satoshis? As far as I know you can set the fee yourself in Trezor's UI. But please keep in mind that setting it lower means you'll also wait a lot longer to have your transaction confirmed.

I'm pretty sure it's a false positive. Every time I download a new release of Electrum Avast stops it, sends it to their labs for inspection and then a day later informs me that the file is safe.
I even check the signatures and they're fine too.

@_date: 2017-11-01 19:49:16
Yes that's correct. Electrum on PC supports signing transactions with Trezor. On android you have Mycelium. I'm sure there are other wallets too.
You can set the fee by selecting "Custom" from the drop down menu. Just make sure you check the mempool before setting a low fee.

No offence but this was a legitimately funny question. No, there's no age limit to using bitcoin because it's entirely permissionless. As long as you can use computer software you can use bitcoin. There's no one in charge to stop you.


I don't know what is the best way but some of the options are selling it on P2P markets like hodlhodl or Bisq, using two way BTC ATMs or selling it face to face for cash.

1. Your seed should be randomly generated, which makes it hard to remember. No, don't tell me you can do it. You're going to forget and lose your keys.
2. Yes. A wallet serves other functions too besides storing keys like generating that said seed, deriving addresses from it and signing transactions.
3. Do you know how to generate addresses from a seed without wallet software? Kind of hard to receive bitcoins without addresses. I should add that if you don't intend on using addresses associated with your seed for receiving or sending bitcoins you can simply store your seed on paper, steel or whatever you wish and import it into a wallet software once you need to.

Currently your BTC and BCH are in exact same addresses behind the same private keys. If you want to make BCH transactions but you don't trust BCH wallets to handle private keys that also grant access to your BTC you just move your BTC to a new address before you make any BCH transactions. That way your BTC cannot be accessed with the private key you currently use.

You don't need to separate them as long as you have them in an offline wallet. You have them both and they just use the same address on their own chains.
However if you plan on using BCH or BTC you should probably move them to different addresses just so that they aren't behind the same private key.

Depends on the ATM. Some ATMs let you sell your coins too some don't.
Only way to make new coins is to mine them as a block reward. Whenever you buy coins they are from someone.

No. Bitcoin 2.0 wouldn't be Bitcoin. If someone asked for Bitcoins you wouldn't be able substitute those Bitcoins with Bitcoin 2.0.

Does copay use segwit? Current version of Electrum does not support segwit and will not show you balances that are in segwit addresses.

It won't. If your wallet gets hacked it means your private keys were compromised and the hacker used them to move your funds out of your wallet.

There is no such thing as a bitcoin account. Your Coinbase account is just that. An account on their website that has a certain amount of BTC tied to it. Coinbase doesn't give you your private keys so it's impossible to import your Coinbase wallet to another service.
If you hold your own private keys you can import them to as many wallets as you like as long as those wallets support importing private keys.
@_date: 2017-09-25 23:25:13
You aren't getting to those keys unless you have the password or a seed.

Yes if those really are the recovery words for those private keys that held your coins.
Download electrum, restore your wallet, select "I already have a seed" when it asks, then click options and check these boxes.
Your pass phrase should be the last word.

@_date: 2017-10-13 21:00:03
Hardware wallets like Trezor are very, very secure and easy to use. As long as you do not input your recovery seed on **any** digital device or flash it in front of cameras it should be impossible to remotely steal your bitcoins. I recommend looking into it.

Wouldn't this be a huge issue? That person could make losing trades with collateral that isn't actually there.
@_date: 2017-10-22 20:07:00
I would use it for everything if I could. All you need to do is replace them as you spend them. But the thing is that you can't really spend Bitcoins anywhere apart from some online stores.

Do NOT move 2X coins after the hard fork! They have no replay protection which means you could lose your BTC if you make any 2X transactions.
Also making BTC transactions after the hard fork could mean losing your 2X coins.


Yes. You can move your BCH and it won't affect your BTC even if they "share" the same address. If you decide to move them to an exchange just make sure you are moving them to a BCH address. BTC and BCH addresses look the same.

You might want to look into mimblewimble. I'm not going to pretend that I understand much of this but people claim this enables confidential transactions without bloating the transactions.

Looking at charts is sort of pointless because you can put log on or off, stretch it in x- and y-axis and zoom to parts you like to manipulate it so that it looks the way you want.
Want it to look like a massive bubble? Turn log off and squeeze the x-axis. Works the other way around too. You can make it look like whatever you want it to be.
In other words, look at Bitcoin as it is, not how it looks on a chart.
