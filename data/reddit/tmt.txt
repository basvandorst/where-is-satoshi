We all know who wins at the end. Keep strong

Who does that?

My opinion, it can go up or down.

I'm from SA - a fool and his money will soon be parted. Can't stay the richest woman doing (selling) idiotic things like that. Crypto is only just beginning. One day her biggest waste of money was to sell when she did.

It went down.

Are you're bitcoun gone since yesterday? Karen says she have not receives it?

Gold asked the same question to fiat... Adapt or die.

Bru you can't always have correction between 13 800 and 9000. At some point it will break past those levels. We already had a few 10 000 touches and went back down. The growth this time looks nice and stable, no 10 min 1000 jumps. At some point bitcoin will break past 20 000 again, hopefully with some stable natural growth

Why do you blame Kraken when you forgot or got your own passwords incorrect?

Which is the majority. I live in South Africa and believe me it's apartheid against the whites. Unfortunately they still need us.

Bitcoin is not the problem, buying and selling illegal stuff is. Cash can also be used for illicit stuff and you won't believe it, but far more illegal transactions are made with cash than bitcoin. So shouldn't cash be banned?

Everything should not be measured by USD value, but rather sats value. You missed the ALT season. Spread your risk and have a higher % just in BTC. Then you don't have to battle the sats value as most alts are 90% and more down in sats value.

It's a fake post

Hands down the smartest question of all time.
@_date: 2019-06-27 10:00:26
Nice work, waiting so long just to sell right at the bottom! That's how one should do it, buy at the top &amp; sell at the bottom.
@_date: 2019-06-29 15:09:39
Please states your facts. Google, Coinbase and Oracle (to name a few) thinks otherwise. Stop stating things without being able to back them.
@_date: 2019-06-29 15:45:26
Exactly, I'd rather just enjoy my gains and not waste time on delusional people. The future is here and time adapt or die.
@_date: 2019-12-31 06:56:04
Can you please explain how you don't understand this?
Would you give someone your banking login details to install paint on your computer.
Honesty this is the dumbest question I've heard in a long time

Luno sent another email stating in was erroneously sent and can be ignored.

Asking questions like that means you aren't ready for crypto tbh.
@_date: 2019-05-09 19:31:41
That's if bitcoin holds it current dominance. People will get greedy and alt season will kick off again. Cycles of the market.
