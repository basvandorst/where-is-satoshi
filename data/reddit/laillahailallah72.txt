says the American Federal Reserve Bank which has controlled and continues to control all global imports and exports. When the gold backing to the Federal Reserve Note was dropped, it was replaced with imports and exports. The largest import being OIL. Bitcoin is not tied to oil. Therefore bitcoin has no stable value. This is economics 101.

as long as the federal reserve dominates the world continuosly it's nearly impossible for the bitcoin to replace anything.
you think the concept of the cryptocurrency will stop the CIA/FBI/Federal Reserve from having full control over the worlds economy?
laughable. a history book will give you a good idea. these people are just being optimistic though, id be too when btc just rocketed 17x+ its value a little while ago.
