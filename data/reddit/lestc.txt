And there I was hoping that we could break away from btc
@_date: 2018-08-21 22:16:28
Do whatever the fuck I want.. I paid for this crap
@_date: 2018-08-13 12:59:05
How did you manage that? 
@_date: 2018-08-09 12:44:42
Bizarre

I sent ledger nano with custom fees. If I have to increase the fees then thats segwit out the window and if it's happening to others that 14% will not be 14% anymore. I actually don't give a shit about down votes up votes or upsetting the btc fan club. As a means of payment we all know it's a waste of time and the only benefit, if at all is the digital gold thing. 
I personally think btc is holding everything else back. These people that bang on about how great it is should move on. Yes it was great at the time but that was a few years ago so unless you can send btc for next to nothing and it arrives as you would hope it would like nano for example, then please give it a rest . Reminds me of these blokes who still buy and wear Reebok classics and have never tried another pair on coz they are the dog bollox. Sad

I switched to segwit and had to wait over  2 hours for tx to process.  What a  marvellous technology breakthrough

Am I ok ? I'll tell you What, after watching my money take a massive nose dive the last couple of days this is exactly what I needed and the funny thing is you guys just keep on giving �� your got the cheek to say I sound like the ramblings of some one with a tenuous grip on reality . Are you being serious ? This is from a member of  the amazing technology gang . 
Just give it a rest .
Oh I must warn you guys, dont ever use nano because OMFG you just wont be able to handle it. The technology is so strong in that one that I really fear for you . I advise that you never use it on your own just in case you can't handle the amazing technology .
Now if you can excuse me I am going to walk over to family Mart and use my phone to purchase some goodies just like everyone else does over here . If you ever get out that cave or desert island don't come to a country where using your phone to pay for the goods is the norm because your look quite silly foaming at the mouth when talking to the pretty sales assisant
@_date: 2018-06-12 01:04:25
Have you been living in a cave or a desert island  all your life ? Amazing technology is a little far fetched. I cringe when I read these type of posts 
@_date: 2018-06-12 02:21:02
i never use this sort of jargon so excuse me just this once , I am PMSL ����. Are you suggesting that it's "amazing technology" please leave me alone. I am in tears. Amazing technology , come on are you guys, serious. I mean how old are you ?  Is it a cure for cancer, hhhhmmmm , I don't think so. Will it take a man to mars hhhhmmmm, I don't think so, I could go on and on . No I havnt havnt  used lightning and if your about to suggest I should and then I will see the amazing technology for myself ���� . Just maybe it might be a mind blowing experience.  Do me a favour and you and your mates go and play with your new found amazing technology and leave me alone
. I remember when I used a debit card about 30 years I was impressed and I was pretty impressed when i used nano because it was much quicker than anything else but I wasn't overcome with emotion that led me to believe it might change the world we live in. 
You guys have just made my day ��������
@_date: 2018-06-12 05:42:58
Thank you if that makes you feel better but coming from someone who gets a hard on over the lightning network and  who must be either under 12, has an IQ of under 50 or retarded that doesnt make me feel any better. 
Your detect sarcasm or irony as you develope more as a person,,, maybe
@_date: 2018-06-12 05:15:13
Really and why would that be ?
@_date: 2018-06-12 05:28:46
What amazing technology are we talking about here , are we talking about the magical,mystical lightning network, by the way , how much does it cost to have the privilege of using this service ? 
Bitcoin ??? Did I invest in Bitcoin?? Let's for argument sake say I did . I invested in Bitcoin because I wanted to make shit loads of money , now please tie me in knots 
@_date: 2018-06-10 18:39:57
Another comedian . How many more times . . I'm with the other guy on this ,, fuck off
@_date: 2018-06-14 15:23:09
When moon when lambo
@_date: 2018-06-12 05:53:05
Considering all other forms of payment crypto etc etc
Am I missing something here . Doesn't lightning network involve cryptocurrencies?
