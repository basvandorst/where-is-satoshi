I cannot report  to Twitter. Every time I try I receive the following message "403 Forbidden: The server understood the request, but is refusing to fulfill it."

I have no idea what I am doing. Can you show me how to setup my own node? Directions on literature?

Looks like Menufy that processes the transactions. One of our Chinese restaurants here in Austin uses Menufy (which allows for Bitcoin payments).

I was aware of a Bitcoin for some time now. I never really took it serious until recently (this year for a matter of fact). From time to time, I would check in on the value of Bitcoin and I found it hard to believe that cryptocurrency had a future. As the price of Bitcoin increased, it drawn my curiosity. At the time, I really didn't have a good paying job to invest into Bitcoin, so I had to be an observer for the most part. As Mt Gox filed for bankruptcy I saw the value of Bitcoin take a nose dive. At that point, I felt for sure Bitcoin died, and was glad I didn't waste my money. But as time went on, you know the story, the value of Bitcoin increased and then increased more. Now here we are at $4,400. I am glad I started investing into cryptocurrency this year. I didn't want to observe any longer and had to just do it. I see a bright future for all who are invested.
