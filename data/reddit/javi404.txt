I wish I sold at 17K Sold today because I feel like we are going to settle at $10K here. I think there was lots of hype + manipulation of the market in December. Now that hype has died down a little.
The question is, how will this effect the TX fees?
@_date: 2018-01-15 05:05:20
Exactly this.
@_date: 2018-01-19 15:25:43
I'm thinking OP is a poster looking to make coinbase look bad or just a fucking fool.
If I was going to move $40K anywhere, I would be flying to their offices with a check and bringing my lawyer with me.

move to new wallet in a safe version of electrum. Then setup watch only wallets using the public key so you can see balance from multiple devices.

Just like the stock market as I assumed. Manipulation to buy the wife a new lexus.

After you give some to don't be afraid to gimme sum.
@_date: 2018-01-19 17:14:07
Very possible. If you had 40 million, then 40K is nothing.
@_date: 2018-01-19 15:16:45
I don't know the particulars of this situation but anytime you make a transaction that is $10,000 or more, be prepared that it is reported to the IRS and/or other agencies.
Even a 10K USD withdrawal from your bank account is reported by law.
Perhaps this has something to do with it?
You probably should have done 9K transactions into coinbase instead of $40,000
I hope you didn't bet the house putting $40,000 USD into some online exchange. I would assume this is money you would have been OK with betting on the superbowl or something.
@_date: 2018-01-19 15:24:34

Thanks for this. I would be using a debit card or a visa gift card if using a CC is the fastest way so I would be stuck with the 5% (which is better than 12-14%) and I think that is it.
@_date: 2017-12-23 23:33:30
This is one from an old test.
of course I have the key and can just use a different piece of software or put it in coinbase or something but I just don't know what my options are. Feels like of like throwing away a 20$ bill.

Why is your wife's grandfather texting you? Don't you think this a little bit strange? OK, I read the rest of your post, I understand you have a bond with him.
Just don't talk to him about finances ever. This business is between you and your wife.
Talk about stocks bonds and the usual shit, and just don't mention crypto till you cash out and pull up in a brand new Ferrari.

for fucks sake. I signed up last night. Made 2 transactions. Bitcoin buy and litecoin buy. Now they don't show up and they want my ID and pic. and that is broken. What a pain.
@_date: 2017-12-23 21:10:17
I kind of thought it was funny, why is OP trying to get his wife's grandfather into bitcoin?
The fucking guy lived his life already.  Also, how the fuck old is this OP that his wife's grandfather is still alive in the first place? Or how old is the grandfather? like 101?

I don't know what bullshit is on but check my history, not trolling.
I turned about 100 USD into ~1500 in less than a year.
I am doing fucking great in the stock market, but 60% returns is nothing compared to that.
Why the fuck wouldn't I gamble more?
I don't have any fees anyway, I'm a low problem long time renter to a home owner who has probably paid off his mortgage with my rent by now. When I explain why the rent is late, he will probably want in on it.
The reason I posted is to see if I am not the only crazy fuck in here who likes to gamble.

I love watching the videos those operations. They don't give a lying fuck about anything except keeping the miners running dirt cheap.
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:32:56
I have a coinbase account. I made transactions last night. Today they don't even show up. It tells me I need to verify my account by sending pics of my face and license. I do, it fails. hassle. still doesn't work.


I did this last night to make the 2 transactions for BTC and Litecoin and now it is like it never happened. If it is still in their system, good. but I don't see it now.
@_date: 2014-03-07 00:40:12
What some journalist puts in 1 article is not evidence. It's just her word. Now if 2 different journalists independently verify the same information, then that might be a little more plausible.
The bottom line here is that this is about selling print copies of Newsweek for the new owners and selling online subscriptions. It's not about investigative journalism that the Newsweek of times past was known for. Only the name was sold to new owners. Read for yourself.
@_date: 2014-09-09 05:34:42

There is nothing to credit the article in the first place. Its a mis understood quote. The whole article is based on a quote denied by the person who said it. Why didn't she record it? Because its BS.
@_date: 2014-03-07 07:43:37
Agreed, and I also grew up with model trains (HO Scale) and I see nothing online linked to the name Dorian overlaps with crypto or bitcoin.

My guess is someone in Thailand didn't get paid to allow him to operate there. They then came back and shut it down permanently.

@_date: 2014-03-06 17:13:13
He isn't actively doing anything so they probably aren't interested in him much. Plus if you read the article he has worked in the defense industry with security clearances etc. Pretty sure they are watching the exchanges more than anything else. They already blanket tap everyone anyway so this wouldn't be new.
@_date: 2014-03-05 02:46:49
How do you know it wasn't mt.gox cashing out and saying (we don't know what happened we were hacked.)
Once the transactions have cleared its all done.
@_date: 2014-03-11 00:15:08
Link is to an example of one, seem like an endless supply of these transactions right now for the same value.

@_date: 2014-03-06 19:34:27
I predict this is Newsweek's last chance to keep from going under for good. This special print edition is a gimmick. This whole thing is planned and staged and this Dorian guy is just some unlucky bastard who was born with the wrong name. Its obvious that this l.goodman is just a shill who will work for the highest bidder (check who she writes freelance for on her website).  I predict this whole thing goes away in a few weeks. 
BTW, the Newsweek you remember is long gone. The only thing left was the name and that was sold to these new characters. Its a shame that they tarnish the name with this "journalism" after it being a trustworthy news source that was in print for more than 80 years.
@_date: 2014-03-10 03:04:37

There are more than one Satoshi Nakamoto out there. I bet there are at least 20 of them in computer or engineering fields. Considering there are about 8 billion people on the planet there are many shared names.
@_date: 2014-03-07 00:10:59
The only hard evidence I see in the article is they found a guy born with that name. How many others are they? Also the guy changed his name way long ago. Why would he use the name Satoshi. He didn't even want to use it in real life. If he didn't want to go by Dorian online, why wouldn't he just use Jack Ryan. Unless this guy comes out and says "Yes, I originally created bit coin" then I am not buying this evidence. Even if this reporter is lucky and found him. She may be correct. But there isn't much to substantiate her evidence other than this guy did some programming (just like 80% of reddit users) and lives a reclusive lifestyle (like how many others on here?)
That is not proof, its circumstantial evidence.

@_date: 2014-03-06 17:14:41
Exactly. Its just some guy who is a recluse and shares the same name. The fact is that if it wasn't recorded, it didn't happen.
@_date: 2014-03-07 01:34:56
looks like most of us here were correct. Its not him.
@_date: 2014-03-07 23:50:40
But since it's not confirmed that he is the same satoshi that invented bitcoin then he was not a public figure. Although he is one now thanks to Newsweek.
@_date: 2014-03-06 19:13:55
Fuck that. Post her shit.
@_date: 2014-03-07 00:35:29
This looks way more valid to me. And in the end, who cares. If the Real Satoshi doesn't want to come forward, we may never really know who he is/was. And in the end. Who cares. It might be better that way.
@_date: 2014-03-07 19:35:24
For her to take that quote if its even true, as proof, is BS journalism.

Those people don't do their own banking and probably don't use computers much.
They have accountants and lawyers do it for them. They just make calls and say "get me on a flight to Tokyo" "Book me a hotel" "Buy that restaurant I like" "double the size of the pool in my Miami house for this winter"
Then once a month, someone sits down and goes over their net worth with them.
