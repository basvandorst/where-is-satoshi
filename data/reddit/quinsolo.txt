Point them to the cash app by square. Super easy to use, but they'll have to install a seperate btc wallet to withdraw from cash app and send to your store.

this is why running a node is important. 
Users that run fully validating nodes will not accept that miner's transaction. It is considered invalid because it does not follow the rules determined in the bitcoin protocol. Block reward amounts are part of that rule set. 
These rules can only be changed if every user agrees and decides to run a new version of the software. This is a very difficult task as there are thousands of nodes across the globe.
This is also part of the reason for the smaller blocksize. We need to have the absolute minimum amount of system requirements so any and all users who want to run a node can with minimum hardware. Bitcoin Core, the full node software, can run on Raspberry Pis, Phones, and basic computers.
This is partly what makes Bitcoin decentralized.

People want to hold an asset as a store of value. It can't be used as a medium of exchange before people want it to store their value. Then once people want it to hold consistantly, we can price things in satoshis. I agree we should use btc, but the logical order is store of value, medium of exchange, then unit of account.

You could, but then people would choose to route around you because you charge high fees. Might as well do an on-chain tx at that point. 
Edit: when LN becomes a proper mesh network because of auto pilot features and new routing algorithms are implemented, hubs will not even be a theoretical problem. 
@_date: 2018-06-20 13:51:56
@_date: 2018-06-05 18:57:08
That is the lightning network. Instead of "offline" its "offchain".  But it keeps track of all the channel states. 
Also, opendime works that way too. You physically transfer the device IRL and have to rip it open to get the private keys to withdraw.

So sorry about that! International packages over a certain weight do cost quite a bit more. USPS has certain rules about the rigidity of the envelopes.  It was 16 to send a medium package to Germany from Texas the other day.
But I think you may have found a bug in the shipping calculation. Shipping only two magnets would be right on the threshold of sending for a lower price. Ill check it out and get back to you! Pm me and ill send you a discount code. 
Sorry for the issues! 
@_date: 2018-06-17 14:47:36
Right now, you'll need to open a channel directly with my store to do LN txs. This is because there are very few connected nodes with funds on the other side of the channel to enable routing to quinsolo.com. However, we have a few channels with other merchants and routing nodes to enable payment routing. So if you open a quinsolo channel, you can do LN txs with the blockstream store, satoshi's place, and lots of other places that those nodes are connected to.
We are still in the very early stages of LN. In the future, you won't even have to think about selecting and opening a channel. It'll all be done in the bkg with autopilot features.

You should probably wait till a more user friendly LN app comes out. Most LN implementations are in beta and all through command line. It is possible though, go to github if you wanna try. 
Dont think you can use a hw wallet. Coins need to stay connected to the network and always be online to receive on LN. 
Google LITbox. That'll be nice when it is released. 
@_date: 2018-06-18 13:40:57
The only thing that could be centralized in LN is a routing node. If it became a hub and spoke model, that would technically be centralized. But here is the thing, they can do nothing but charge routing fees, that is it. There is no 51% or anything like that in Lightning, no real benefit from being in "control" of a hub. Everything is securely backed by the bitcoin blockchain and time locked. If we saw a hub and spoke forming, everyone would just route around the hub charging high fees and they are no longer a problem. 
With future features like auto pilot, this will not be a problem. 
@_date: 2019-06-09 03:34:25
Watch this asap.
Cash app is great because you can buy and withdraw to your own wallet instantly. Coinbase and some others can make you wait 2 weeks. 
Also, cash app pays the fee and it confirms within a few blocks.

It will clear for sure at 3 sats. 
Worst case scenario, if you bid a very very low fee, like under 1 sat atm, it will just sit in the mempool for a week or so then it will clear out of most mempools like the tx never happened. Your wallet wont see it as unconfirmed, it'll just won't be there. This is why you wait for confirmations on bigger transactions or physical exchanges. 
Most users/miner's mempools clear out after 72 hours of not being cleared, but it'll sit in other's for weeks. I have had this happen to me once. I put in a very low fee, after a week it was cleared and back in my wallet, then two days later the tx cleared and the funds were no longer in my wallet. This can't happen if you do another tx in between with those UTXOs, like if i just broadcasted it again with a higher fee after it cleared. 
The way to fix these "inconveniences"  is with better wallet software. If you have coin control features and the ability to spend unconfirmed txs built into the wallet. The user will have all the tools they need to handle a fluctuating fee market. Replace by Fee (RBF) for senders and Child pays for parent for receivers.
But again, yours will clear if you wait another 24 hours or so.
Setup a lightning node and you wont have to worry about confirmations!! 
@_date: 2019-06-09 03:35:33
This is a true con. I want them to fix this.
@_date: 2019-06-11 16:19:35
yes that is right. 
Even though you bought those coins, a custodial could lose it by getting hacked, negligence, or even government coercion. 
If you control your keys, only you can lose them.
That is the new and unique thing about bitcoin. It's the first time you can secure your funds and have true financial sovereignty.
@_date: 2019-06-07 19:56:57

They set a lower fee, which is ok. But as soon as you did, a bunch of transactions got dumped into the mempool. 
blockstream.info has you clearing in 144 blocks. Which is another day. 
If you look at the mempool over the last 8h, you can see it spike. 
on the left side there are less txs, right as you put yours in it started going up. Your fee is 3sat so you are the blue color on the bottom. The last to get cleared. 
You will clear in the next day or so don't worry. If you need the TX now, they can try a RBF if thats supported by his wallet. (Replace By Fee) which is basically a double spend with a higher fee, it would invalidate your old tx.
There is a "Child Pays for Parent" way to increase the fee since you are the receiver, but i've never done that myself. I need to research how to do that soon...
@_date: 2019-06-07 16:58:35
they can see the balance in the channels you have open, if you are a public routing node. 
If you are private, they can only see the direct channels opened to your peers, i think..

I mis-read the earlier comment. If you have .5 then you would mix it in 5 cycles. If you have 1 BTC you would use 10 cycles. 
The idea is to mix with as many different people as possible, so you would want to break the BTC up and mix as many times as you can. 
@_date: 2018-11-15 21:28:59
The easiest way to do it is to run BTCpayserver. It's meant for merchant processing, but you don't have to use that feature. You can run LN with lnd or c-lightning, and even use the zap gui on lnd. 
You can install it manually on a local machine, but I think it's much more convenient to use a cloud service. Luna node has a one click setup for BTCpay and it's not expensive at all. They accept BTC  for payment too.  
@_date: 2018-11-18 07:12:08
That is for the older version of electrum. The newer version is installed automatically. There is not a plugin option anymore. 
When you use the skeleton on the sd card in electrum it will ask you to plug it in. Just say ok and leave it out it will work by giving you the addresses and balances. Look up the electrum guide to see how to export the transactions so you can sign offline.

i run a lightning network enabled store using BTCPay and it works great for me. 
The drawback i see is that it is very cumbersome. You have to manually open and close channels and balance the liquidity, which is a slight pain. and it is mostly still a command line interface. But all of these problems will be resolved with time and development. I'm excited to see where it will be a year from now!

I would just make the book available for download and put a donation address next to it. 
Or, you could use BTCpay server. There's a feature which let's you create a payment button. You can set it to let the user choose a custom amount. After the payment is complete you could then redirect them to a download page that is hidden from search engines. 
BTCpay has a one click setup, so it's really easy to get started. 
@_date: 2018-11-03 16:24:21
I think he meant someone was buying directly from a miner every time they got the block reward. That wouldn't necessarily shoot up the price in the short term. But that's only 12.5 BTC... Not 500k USD.

You're right, should have toned back the attitude, apologies. 
OP seems new to the space, asking some basic questions. I had the same journey last year with lightning and after a ton of research, BTCpay was the easiest method for me to deploy a node. It is not over complicated to me. 
I'm not a developer or programmer, so from my perspective this setup is very easy with a support structure that was accessible if I had questions. All for no cost. 
I'm not trying to "shill" anything specifically. Luna is the service that is available for 1 click deploy and accepts Bitcoin, that's the only reason I bring them up. You can still use azure too. I have no affiliation with either, other than running btcpayserver on them. 
BTCpay can run locally. There are a ton of projects that are selling hardware with BTCpay running on them. It's not only a cloud service. 
Feedback is good if you want to change things on BTCpay. It's an open source project. Jump in if you want to see something happen.

Bitcoinshirt.co! They have lots of good stuff! 
@_date: 2018-11-17 04:31:06
It is not over complicated at all. I have two servers running now and it was very simple to setup, way more simple than setting up and installing LND or c-lightning on my own machine. It's the easiest way to get access to the full features of LN atm. Hopefully mobile will catch up soon.
Btcpay can be installed on any local system or cloud service that supports docker. Luna Node is the least expensive cloud service with a 1 click setup, that is why i recommend it. 
Have you used BTCpay server recently or are you just spreading negativity for no reason?
@_date: 2018-11-03 16:04:55
You setup a wallet and move over as much bitcoin as you'd like to mix. Then, you queue up the mix within the wallet after those funds confirm. If you only have 1 UTXO of 1 BTC, you would queue up the whole amount and it would automatically enter it in rounds of .10.
Not sure if it only does 1 round of .10 and change the rest or if it will mix the whole btc. I would expect the latter. I've not used it with enough BTC to go through multiple cycles. 
would have a better answer. 
@_date: 2018-11-03 02:22:23

I agree that you should be cautious, but completely avoiding these promotions due to the fact you don't want anyone to know you own BTC is slightly paranoid. 
I started selling crypto themed merchandise to be a part of and contribute to this system. I wanted to help in anyway I could and since i'm not an experienced programmer/developer, I decided to start making these items and sell them for bitcoin and other open blockchain tokens. 
We are currently giving away a free BTC vinyl, just pay the 50 cents for postage (in america). If you want to take part use the code "quinsolobitcoin" 
We also give a free 3D printed bitcoin to anyone who purchases an item that ships out in a package. Basically, anything not in a standard envelope. 
There are a number of things you can do to keep your privacy high. 
\-Proper address management. Make sure you are using a new address every time you are receiving or withdrawing BTC. A good wallet will do this automatically. This will keep the total number of coins spread across different public addresses, making it harder for those analyzing the blockchain to tie all the funds to a specific person. 
\-Use a different shipping address. This could be as simple as sending the items to your office or a P.O. box. As someone else commented, UPS has the ability to hold a package as well. 
\-Don't use your real name. While it may make shipping harder particularly if you send it to an office to holding facility. You can use a pseudonym while placing an order at [quinsolo.com]( We don't want your real name. 
\-Use a privacy focused wallet.  Samourai Wallet has a feature called [ricochet]( it sends the payment through multiple hops, obfuscating the original source. 
We are almost completely self hosted. I run my own btc and ltc node through BTCpay server. We also accept LN transactions in an effort to beta test the software and assist in further development and bug fixes. 
All we are trying to do is support the cryptoconomy by giving people a place to spend their coins on some fun items.

Is there a specific aggregate Bitcoin merchant site you're thinking of?
I found 
But I feel like there's a better one out there. 
I can see it feeling like homework, but I'm just hoping to get people a bit of exposure past the "get rich quick" scheme most media portrays. 
Plus, I would expect someone to not get a noob only Bitcoin as a gift. That would not be the greatest.

It's because you are using coinbase. Not your keys, not your coins. 
If you actually had control of that BTC, you could set your own fee and broadcast the tx yourself. 
I've never had that issue using my own wallet. 
Coinbase is a bank that is okay with crypto. Don't think you are using the real thing when you are not.

I agree with you if Bitcoin is the only gift that is given to a person who has never been interested. You shouldn't be giving Bitcoin to just anyone, but there are some who could benefit. 
There are tons of people in my life that are interested but just haven't taken the steps to getting any btc. This handout would make it a tad easier to gift it without a 30 minute conversation.  
They could watch the quick 5 min video and be done, or read all the links and listen to all the podcasts, whatever they want to do. 
I do see your point tho.

No backups on those make it a tad scary for noobs. 
I'd just get a trezor, ledger or coldcard. They will have to learn a slight bit, but they need to get educated anyways.

It is passive, but you have to withdraw the funds to get them to your node. 
When you get tipped, it's like an IOU for satoshis. If you have a node with routes available, you can create an invoice and withdraw from the tip bot.

I was able to withdraw this quickly without any issues. Thank you so much! 
This is the coolest bot I've seen in a while. Can't wait to use it more!

Yes, but you have to have others tip to use the lntipbit.  Since you don't have a node, you can't deposit or withdraw funds. You can only receive and give away through the bot. 
Think of the tip bot as a custodial wallet. They hold the funds until you withdraw. 
You really should run a node!

Lightning network is coming. Eventually, a company like coinbase will have hosted LN wallets and noobs like OP can instantly transfer. Or better yet, easy plug in and play at home nodes!
We are not there yet, but the currency doesn't suck because of it. 
The concept of mining, holding your own keys, and the fee system are not going to change drastically. People need to have the drive to learn something new and not be closed minded like OP. Realize there are still people out there writing checks at grocery stores, some people are not going to get it.

Pierre Rochard has made an easy lightning setup without using commad line.  
Here is a tweet about it. If you buy our artwork for $0.01 we will give you a code for a free magnet. 
BTCPay Server is great too!!

Because Verizon has bad reception in my area does not mean phones suck.
No one is forcing you to use Coinbase. There are plenty of other options out there.
Use a better service and educate yourself about Bitcoin and the benefits of financial sovereignty. You're obviously missing the point.

Check out the links in the post. You have to have your own node to withdraw. But you can withdraw from the tipbot to spend a ln tx. It kinda works like a custodial wallet. Check out satoshi.place to spend you 15 sats.

We're doing a giveaway on twitter. 
Just follow and retweet and you'll have a chance to win. Odds are usually pretty good based on the number of followers we have.... which is not that many.��
