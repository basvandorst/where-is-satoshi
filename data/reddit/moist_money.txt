Its all starting to make sense now. Thanks.
@_date: 2015-03-19 01:12:42
Thanks, I'll look at this later.
@_date: 2015-03-18 05:25:37
I tried circle today with both my credit cards. Visa and MasterCard. No luck. Maybe its because I'm with Westpac?
@_date: 2015-03-18 23:51:19
Thanks. I'll give that a go.
@_date: 2015-03-18 22:56:02
Thanks for the replies. 
I might have to look into buying bitcoins locally using cash or bank transfer.
@_date: 2015-03-19 08:22:13
Ok I'll look into this tomorrow.
@_date: 2015-03-19 09:31:23
Yeah I'm going through a similar experience. Ive gotten so many bullshit copy/paste email replys. Ive been asked for photo ID and still not managed to buy any coins. Bitcoin will never find mainstream acceptance until this is an issue of the past.

Hi from New Zealand
@_date: 2015-03-19 01:44:10
Thanks. I see how easy bitcoin can bee.
@_date: 2015-03-19 07:42:37
There was only one in the country. And that only lasted for about a month. Never knew it existed.
@_date: 2015-03-19 19:22:42
Will do. Thanks
@_date: 2015-03-18 23:51:06
Yeah I backed out of a few places after being asked to send a scan of my ID.
@_date: 2015-03-18 23:08:13
Yes but this is the main problem with getting bitcoin accepted by the mainstream.
@_date: 2015-03-19 01:13:50
Yes I live in Auckland. I'll check this out.

"Error, whoops something went wrong"
@_date: 2015-03-19 23:45:48
Woo yeah! Thanks
@_date: 2015-03-19 02:18:38
Nope. The only one we had closed last year shortly after opening.
@_date: 2015-03-19 09:59:14
Thanks bro! I won't be giving up on bitcoin. I'm not going to use Igot, seems dodgy like a few of the other sites. Looks like local bitcoins is the way to go.
@_date: 2015-03-19 09:24:10
Haha as you may be aware I know stuff all about bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-03-19 05:32:46
Yeah I can't see this hurdle being overcome anytime soon.
@_date: 2015-03-18 09:15:29
Yup. I have both and neither work.
@_date: 2015-03-19 01:48:18
Looks like the atm was shut down shortly after it was opened :(
@_date: 2015-03-18 23:52:22
Thanks. That put things into context for me.
@_date: 2015-03-19 19:21:30
@_date: 2015-03-19 08:34:37
Yeah I looked into that. I have to physically deposit money for that service. Which seemed over the top at first. But it may be a good option.
@_date: 2015-03-19 01:11:19
Yes but the sheep can eat paper money.
@_date: 2015-03-19 22:22:53
Hey man. I contacted the guys that had the bitcoin ATM. He said the guy that had the machine left. They are not aware of any others that are currently in the country.
@_date: 2015-03-18 20:47:21
Thanks. A few thousand more of those and I won't need to use my credit card.
@_date: 2015-03-19 10:16:20
Thanks. I hadn't heard of that one.
@_date: 2015-03-18 23:51:36
Thanks!! I'll look into that.
@_date: 2015-03-19 01:14:45
Thanks. I won't give up. Everyone here is being so helpful.
@_date: 2015-03-19 19:20:54
Wow, thanks dude!
@_date: 2015-03-19 01:10:46
@_date: 2015-03-18 23:01:19
Yeah I've tried about 20 times with two different cards. No luck.
