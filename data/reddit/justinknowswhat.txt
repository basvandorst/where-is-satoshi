Literally why I bought

Price volatility of +-$100/day is not unexpected, just look at past charts. As far as the current drop, one can only speculate. My guess is that the IRS ruling coupled with the People's Bank of China ruling that all Chinese banks need to stop playing with BTC scared some people, and they jumped out. I wouldn't be too worried about the fiat exchange rate; you're still sitting on a ~2800% gain.

I do have backups, I just can't get access to them. Re-familiarizing myself with bash now (fish spoiled me)
@_date: 2014-04-04 15:09:35
what would i run it from if my computer's off? the recovery terminal?
@_date: 2014-04-04 15:22:41
Just for the record, I recovered my .key file. Backing up to cold storage now

probably, but there hasn't been much movement all day. interested to see what the rest of the world does to the market as most of the US traders start going to bed

If you have a business, your business partners are entitled to know about all of the possible things that can go wrong. With the recent news, Chase is no good. Either move your checking account, or move the business account

How long is the sale going on? I'm interested in grabbing something but I won't have access to my computer until tomorrow!

Check your backups. I just recovered coins that I thought were lost today. What OS are you on?
@_date: 2014-04-04 14:57:53
the drive was already wiped. I found time machine backups. digging through them now for my wallet data
@_date: 2014-04-04 22:51:06
~/Library/Application Support/MultiBit/multibit-data/key-backup
That directory should have a .key file. Use MultiBit's "Import Private Keys" function, in Tools &gt; Import Private Keys to import that file
That is of course, if you have a backup on an external drive somewhere

is it bad if i was waiting for an explosion?
@_date: 2014-04-04 15:28:51
nah man, all of my backups are on an external HD, and i'm about to set up USB's for cold storage

Localbitcoins is cool, I'm just looking for something to trade on that doesn't have any subscription fees. 
Online... forgot that part. haha
@_date: 2014-04-02 04:13:00
well, luckily my orders are in and prices are stagnant. just hope they can still execute trades...
@_date: 2014-04-04 14:25:10
Searching my time machine backups now, no luck cause my drive won't let me access it
@_date: 2014-04-04 13:34:28
So I'm guessing the account's in your name... You may want to consider moving both accounts
@_date: 2014-03-12 16:52:09
all of these are phenomenal, I had no idea they existed. Thanks!
