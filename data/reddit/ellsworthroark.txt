Go to coinatmradar.com and find your nearest bitcoin ATM and buy it with cash. 
Otherwise try localbitcoins or paxful, they have tons of options. 
Also, you should have a good wallet where you are in control of your own funds. For Android, Mycelium is good. For iOS Breadwallet is good. For desktop, Electrum is good.
I would stay away from coinbase and circle as they have a reputation of giving trouble to customers by freezing accounts, collecting information and censoring usecases like prostitution and gambling.

You don't have to listen to your parents. Just buy some bitcoin next time you have some cash, for example. They don't need to know and how could they stop you?
The whole point is that it doesn't matter if you have permission or not because bitcoin is permissionless.


No. First of all, how would an employer find out if you don't tell them? Second of all, you can just say you used it for a legal purpose or maybe just wanted to make an investment. Thirdly, you might consider going into business for yourself instead of getting some kind of job. Finally, many employers don't even check if your resume checks out...there are so many people who have lied through their teeth about their background and experience to get a job, and gotten away with it - so again, the rule is just to not tell them anything they don't need to know. 
Of course I can understand that you would want your parents to be on board with whatever you are doing. It is nice to be on the same page as your kin. But you using bitcoin and them approving of bitcoin are two different things and you can start using bitcoin on your own time and then work on convincing them without letting them in on the fact that you are already using it. Bitcoincan be used to make foreign remittance cheaper (the poor people who send money back to their home country to feed their family, in many cases end up paying over 10% in fees) because you don't need permission or to fill out paperwork etc. Bitcoin is a great innovation that helps the poor and disenfranchised in the world, and your parents don't want that to happen! 
Furthermore, Silk Road was a great thing for drug users, which normally just get abuse from the likes of your parents. Drug users are an ostracised group in society that nobody cares about, and Silk Road made it possible for them to get drugs that were of higher quality and more pure so they were also less damaging for their health. You can really tell the ilk of someone when you hear what kinds of horrors they want to subject drug users to in order to "save them from themselves". The whole drug war was a big scam from one end to the other. Heroin being illegal in the west is the source of the vast majority of the funding of Taliban. There would be basically no opposition in Afghanistan if Heroin was legal in the west. How many people need to die and how many billion dollars need to be spent? How many people need to be bombed? How many people need to be put in prison until this madness ends? 
Meanwhile, pharmacutical drugs prescribed by your doctor, like amfetamines given to 6-years olds due to some bullshit diagnosis (like ADD)...that remains a practice that is fully sanctioned. 
In the end of the day, you shouldn't care what other people think or how they might judge you. Instead you should try to make your own judgement and act accordingly. Sometimes people get offended when they are confronted with a large dose of truth, but that isn't your problem.

I'm not talking about whether it makes sense to do so or not. That's a different discussion. 
I'd say what makes sense is to buy coffee beans and make your coffee at home. Or forgot it alltogether and just hodl the Bitcoin - I'm not sure lightning would make people want to spend (waste) their Bitcoin (on petty purchases) anyway.
Or you could pay for your next 10 coffees in advance. As long as you pay the fees, you can buy whatever you want, even drugs - that's the whole point. 
And if you don't want to pay the transaction fees, you could hand someone an opendime to avoid paying them.

I noticed that at the beginning of the discussion it seemed like the Chinese miners had a strong opinion in favour of BIP 100. Then, over time, it seemed like they didn't know exactly what was the best idea and deferred to the users and developers. At one point it seemed like they said miners were the end all...and at another point it seemed like they said it was up to everybody else. 
My interpretation is that they were discussing different aspects more than committing to one specific thing. That in English the translation is something like "the Chinese miners think that ________", but that the more accurate translation into English would be "one important aspect is ________, and I doubt that any other of the Chinese miners would disagree directly (even though they might give another issue more weight)". That from what I hear Westerners often mistake Asians for saying something very definite, whereas in reality it is more of a "maybe". Could it be that Asian philosophy has a tradition of using a more "fuzzy language"?
Since you have experience in China, do you have any views on that?

Kudos, great work!


Yes, but is it not in the spirit of Bitcoin to unify those differences with a compromise rather than to split up? Anyway, sometimes it doesn't always work out between people and I still wish you luck in developing the organisation as it now will be easier for the board to find compromises.  
Some ideas I think could be a good way forward for the foundation in 2016:
1. DevCore (corporate and preferably institutional sponsorship and grants can help lower the cost for the foundation, this is where the work goes into filing applications (and finding which to file) and cold calling which can be helped by community participation).
2. Research into how to perform education and outreach effectively and eventually coming up with a better plan over time (maybe partner with a university or try to just establish some metrics informed  through community participation).
3. Research how to create public budgets, plans and accounts and implement it for 2017 (again, crowd source ideas and ask the community or experts who know about these things for help).
4. The rapidly changing dynamics of the bitcoin space requires leaving some manoeuvring room for unforeseen events (keeping reserves at 50% USD and 50 % BTC would give the foundation the possibility of benefiting from an increase in bitcoin price as well as being able to deal with expenses in a bear market).

The Bitcoin Knowledge podcast is great. Trace Mayer is correct. The only thing that held Bitcoin back was the fear created with the division because of the blocksize debate. That is not an issue anymore, and it turns out that Bitcoin is stronger than expected in Latin America and China. Localbitcoins shows growth pretty much across the whole world ( 
Currently, the block reward is 25 BTC per block. 25x6x24x365 gives something like $263m per year at a price of $200, $526m per year at $400, etc. that needs to be invested to keep the price at that level for one year. Additionally, you have people selling their coins, or spending them with a merchant that converts it to fiat. So we are talking massive amounts of money being invested directly into bitcoin itself. Possibly a billion per year or more in the last two years. And this money is increasingly coming from all over the world, making the Bitcoin network far more decentralised as information is translated. 
We are talking massive interest over time from all over the world, even among wealthy people. We are talking a recent increase in Google searches for Bitcoin. We are talking a recent increase in the price. The scaling issue roadblock is not present. On top of that you have all the benefits of Bitcoin *and* the block reward halving. 
There is no way we aren't going to see a massive increase in price to at least 3000, if not far more. And if we can get there, people are going to ask themselves if it could go even higher. Then we will start seeing currencies failing, governments trying to really ban Bitcoin, and the collapse of a real exchange rate as no one would want fiat anyway. By 2020, Bitcoin could hold a very significant part of the world's total wealth.

I agree with what you are saying. 
Yet I do think that it is still possible to be even less aggressive and even more diplomatic without destroying a core resistance to trolling. My point is that we should not get frustrated and angry with the shills and sockpuppets if we can avoid it. We must learn to keep our own emotions in check so that when the evidence of sockpuppeteering and shilling becomes obvious, we can feel vindicated even to the those who got caught in the flow of the opposite argument without feeling superior. 
I'm not saying to take the feelings of the shills into account. But please assume they are real people if they give a little evidence of it so that we can rescue as many from that space as possible.

I agree. It is **not a good idea** to store *all one's money* with a third party. (which is why I would suggest that Coinbase creates a wallet(/vault) option that has private keys 100% in control of the user). 


Hell yes, they are useful. Only problem is that new users might not be aware that if they store money with Coinbase they will not get all the benefits they have been "sold on" regarding Bitcoin (ie no trust and no permission). 
I believe that Coinbase would get a lot more credit here if they would just be a little bit more honest and upfront about those things (without having to create too many extra clicks for new users)...like all they have to do is to remind users a little bit about where private keys reside and what it means. 
In the end of the day, Coinbase needs to find a way to take care of the users who want smooth sailing in practice while also caring for the users who want control of their own fund. In that way they will get all kinds of people to endorse them because it would be possible to prove that they are also taking users interests' into account.
@_date: 2015-12-28 01:04:47


I agree. 
Maybe we have two camps. One scared about Bitcoin collapsing because of too slow development. And the other scared of Bitcoin collapsing due to rash development action. 
As a community we need to stick together -- that is what will give Bitcoin value and hence succeed. Fear would break us apart and there is no economical reason any actor should want to break sticking together or break cooperation up. 
Any actor who is going against that economical incentive will lose out. And we all need to trust in that economical incentive, because we trust that people in the end will act in their best interest over time.
EVERYBODY: Stop worrying. In time, we will come together and scale because the only thing that gets us together is our common interest in the first place. **Bitcoin will not die**. 
@_date: 2015-12-05 19:56:25
But what if they can't increase the interest rate?: 
Besides, it isn't like they would try to raise it a lot. We are talking fractions of percent here. 
I think the likely outcome of a very modest rate hike would be that they can pull it off and that money would keep going into USD, propping up the exchange rate. 
Short term, we are probably looking at a strong USD and a weak Euro, since the Eurozone looks likely to push forward into negative rates, even a modest increase in US rates will have great effects in the forex market. I mean, outliers Switzerland, Sweden and Denmark have negative interest rates already. Of course, cash is a problem when you have negative interest rates so many if not most Europeans have severe and increasing both legal and practical restrictions on cash (in Germany craftsmen have to be paid electronically to be able to declare taxes from 2016 on, France has restricted buying anything at more than a few thousand Euros with cash, Greece is forcing civil servants and pensioners to use plastic only).
Longer term, this will create a further crisis in the outer parts of the hegemony, like SE asia, South America or Africa who then lose their purchasing power and have their prices inflating, causing more money to flow into the "safety" of the USD. Then, eventually, it will be Europe and Japan who get inflation, before the collapse eventually reaches the heartland and the USD fails.

They are changing the way their currency is valued from basing it only on the dollar, to basing it on a basket of currencies. Similar to a move by Singapore before they introduce a completely free-floating currency, and as far as I understand a move that the Chinese government has been talking about for years as part of their plan to move towards a completely market-based exchange rate.
The big news here isn't China at all, it is the incredible strength of the dollar. To my mind it plays directly into the idea that people are seeing dollars or dollar-based assets as a safe haven or lower risk. Basically, we are seeing capital flows into the dollar, because the US is still the most powerful country, and hence it will be the last one to have its currency fall - thus creating a huge movement of money into dollars, as other currencies get into trouble. Eventually of course, people will stop demanding USD as well, and then it is all over.

And you're saying Bitcoin will be unsuccessful just because. 
In fact, there are good reasons for why bitcoin will be successful. There are no alternatives to proof of work and Bitcoin has the most proof of work done. That means that nobody else can build a permissionless, immutable ledger that actually works. These are the same reasons since the beginning. On top of that we are seeing the realization of second layers *and* confidential transactions (increase in fungibility). The two biggest problems in Bitcoin is lack of fungibility/privacy *and* figuring out scaling. These things are being solved as we speak in very smart and well thought through ways. There has never been a more exciting time to be in Bitcoin.

For sure Core had some weaknesses in communication, but that is being improved.

The Bitcoin core devs have contributed a lot to BU by exposing vulnerabilities. They didn't have to do that, but they did. By helping them they have also experienced that, not only is the project full of vulnerabilities, it is also not well tested, nor is it patched very quickly. 
BU isn't very interesting for devs to work on, because its core tenant of unlimited block size is total madness. The reason that it is madness is that it is dangerous for the network. Nobody wants to work on an unreasonable project. BU just isn't Bitcoin, so there's nothing to be passionate about. Bitcoin is a honey badger that doesn't care.

Yes, the Chinese government could try to take control of the mining power in China, but they would have a hard time doing it as there are many pools with miners all over the world. If they shut down a pool, miners can switch to another pool. Then there would be the public outrage of the government shutting down owners of legitimate businesses when they have said that they will not ban bitcoin. 
If the Chinese government tried to disrupt or control the supply of chips from China, that would quickly render China irrelevant as all chip producers would move to countries with more stable political climates.
Neither the American nor the Chinese government exist in isolation. And they are not all powerful. Besides, I think a growing number of the elites are amassing Bitcoin, so they will have an economical incentive for it not to die.

I can see it existing without much use as a regular payment system for coffees and toilet paper...just like gold is working just fine without being used regularily as a payment system (though hard core gold bugs use gold as a payment system whenever they can). Am I missing something here?
edit: Anyway, the Lightning Network will allow Bitcoin to disrupt traditional payment systems in a way that simply increasing the blocksize limit won't. That is because the Lightning Network is built in a layer on top of Bitcoin and will allow far larger throughput, lower fees, etc. than running every single transaction on the actual Bitcoin network. Hence, if you want Bitcoin to scale to the level where it can replace all other legacy payment networks *and* allow for *even more* transactions...then the scaling roadmap of Bitcoin Core should be the best way. Bitcoin Core wants to increase the blocksize, just a little later, and preferably after IBLT will make it safer. In the meantime SegWit will buy some time as well as making other important fixes at the same time. Bitcoin Core wants to increase the blocksize, just in a smarter, safer way:

I wouldn't be surprised about that either. But I thought you were talking about an attack with the potential to break Bitcoin...and I think people who try, will find it much harder than they thought (I believe several actors have tried already or decided against it). 
It makes very little sense at the outset because it is a global phenomenon and its nature makes it exceedingly hard to do so, especially without detection (which is vital for the plan to work). 
You have to be stupid enough to try, but let's say someone is. And what if you are right. What if some actor decided to try and burn $10-20bn to get rid of the $6bn blip that Bitcoin most likely looks like to their minds. Then discover that it will take another $50bn when the price is at the moon, causing other people to invest in mining *and* their plan is discovered because you simply can't throw these kinds of sums around unnoticed. Then, after burning enormous sums of what is probably other peoples money (as this is more than anyone has lying around) this actor would have to have the polical capital to absorb the backlash of the destroyted useful economic activity. We are talking about someone willing to piss off the whole world and burn tens if not hundreds of billions of dollars on something that is unlikely to work.
And then, eventually, an alternative coin, resistant to that attack would appear. 
I would have believed your attack a vague possibility a couple of years ago (but then Bitcoin was too small for them to bother caring that much about it), and by now it is starting to get so expensive and difficult to accomplish that doing it secretly enough would hardly be possible, and hence the whole attack would not be possible.

So it is the miners who are keeping the blocksize smaller and not the artificial limit?
@_date: 2016-01-21 16:31:40
As far as I understand, most of the miners are happy to do blocksize scaling along Core's roadmap instead of risking to try to break away from some of the smartest and (after the blocksize debate) clearly most patient and level-headed coders in the world. But of course they support bigger blocks eventually, everyone does that. Core has just come up with an ultra-conservative way of doing that as safely as possible without rushing into less optimal solutions based on some fear that the Bitcoin price will tank if we don't increase the blocksize yesterday...I got into Bitcoin after careful deliberation, and I'm in for the long haul. So far Core has been consistently adding value and I see no reason to fear they will stop doing that. Additionally their scaling roadmap does offer clear solutions with the least risk. 
Who else offers a clear solution with equal or less risk?
@_date: 2016-01-21 08:43:32
Then we agree that he did not say that Core will change the PoW mechanism to stop Classic, right?

I believe what he means is that you have to use a node as your wallet or point your lightweight wallet to get data from your own node. There has to be a selfish reason for why you are doing it.
There are lots of benefits to you: you get increased financial privacy, and you get much better security when receiving transactions from untrusted third parties. With your own node, you can check and verify the network and your balance yourself. Otherwise your "vote" when we are talking about economic majority is going along with whomever's node your lightweight wallet is pointed to.

If the black budget is $52bn, and CIA controls $15bn of that, how is building and desining a chipfab from scratch a negible cost to them? 
The Chinese government could order miners from hardware producers. But extremely large orders would probably be detected. 
That doesn't mean that the Chinese government *easily* could set up a clandestine mining hardware-producing factory. Besides, how much do the CIA and the Chinese governemnt know about the technicalities of running a large scale mining operation? 
If word ever got out that CIA were trying to do this, China would follow suit, and vica-versa. So would every other country hoping to gain geopolitical influence by burning cash. Before they know it, their other objectives would be trumphed by their economic interest in Bitcoin.

You mean apart from having code with lots of bugs, poor testing and a non-open process?
Well, the main problem with Bitcoin unlimited is that it allows miners to increase the blocksize as much as they want. 
This increases centralisation pressure. Eventually you'll only have one big miner and then there's no security anymore. 
A second problem with unlimited blocks, is that it increases the costs for full nodes. Full nodes verify that the network rules are kept and they are the backbone of Bitcoin security, but unlike miners, they get no financial incentive from Bitcoin. We need full nodes to be secure, and we have to be careful of making that too expensive.
There are more problems. I suggest you go read about them.

It might be obvious to you. To me it was not the most obvious way to interpret what he wrote at all. 
But maybe part of the reason for that is because I tried to read the context of the discussion before I started interpreting what I thought he meant rather than just reading one line.
It is not about whether he *could* have anticipated it, but about whether he *did* anticipate it and about whether he is always thinking about all of the ways people can percieve what he says in the most negative light possible. I'm pretty happy that he spends most of his time thinking about how to improve Bitcoin in the best possible way. 
You *could* also have tried to understand what he was trying to say instead of speculating in what kind of subterfuge he was trying to do on behalf of the other core devs. 
Look, I'm not saying that everyone who misunderstood GM are idiots...misunderstandings happen every day to everybody, and it doesn't signify that they are dumb. But by calming down and trying to understand, doing a little research and at least reading comments above and below one does reduce the chance of misunderstanding.
I just think it is unfair of you to put all the blame on GM for other people misunderstanding what he is saying about some obscure technical issue that is really unlikely to happen where he is basically just referencing discussions other people have made many times before in regard to what could be done if miners turned on the rest of the network.

What luke is saying isn't FUD. He is trying to protect the community and trying to keep it together. BU is an altcoin because it is a complete deviation from the community promise of Bitcoin, which was a decentralised cash system. 
Furthermore, he isn't denouncing people trying to make altcoins, he is just fed up with people wanting to call their altcoin "bitcoin" because that name is already taken.
If you were so interested in the good of the community, it would help if you could stop painting someone else as the villain while you yourself is spreading a very coloured narrative. Stop focusing on other people so much, start educating yourself as to why luke holds the position he does and then start helping the community understand why we need to move forward building on what we have started while BU is something else entirely and that people are free to pursue other projects on their own if they so choose (but there's no reason to mix that in with bitcoin).

I thought the limit was on the blocksize, not on the number of transactions. 


You mean don't want it to be possible to make one transaction represent several other transactions?

Well, you are completely uninterested in using a layer on top of Bitcoin that settles into Bitcoin (would be perfect for smaller transactions). Then you are saying that for larger transactions, the fees would still be too high on the Bitcoin network without qualifying it. The whole thing is that Core is trying to develop a method that would allow billions of people to use Bitcoin's aircraft carrier-grade security. Only scaling the blocksize would not be enough for the whole world to use it as a low-fee payment network.


This is patently false. They surely own *some* bitcoin. But they definitely own the Bitcoin network as a whole.


Based on the scaling roadmap. You are simply assuming bad faith in core and pulling accusations out of your ass. 
Elements and Lightning will add tremendous value to Bitcoin, no matter how you look at it, because it would mean that you would be able to run billions and billions of transactions that settle into Bitcoin. The value of bitcoin would go up.

Everybody wants 2mb...the question is why do we **have to** have it *right now?* Is there a problem with taking it easy, see how SegWit pans out and how the fee market pans out and in general gather more data?

Ah. Exactly. What you explain above is exactly why i don't believe that miner is fully aware of what he is saying. Or that it at least is more posturing than hard definite promise. ...It would be different if that miner added "and if that means I will block progress til 2018-2019 then so be it".
Also it is worthwhile to consider the possibility of cultural difference between west and east. What could sound like a definite promise in the West could actually be more of a reminder of one possibility in the east.
Personally I'm just seeing a rehash of the 2015 blocksize debate...just in China. Since everything was already hashed out before so loudly, clearly and publicly, there is reason to believe the Chinese might even go through the motions faster. 
I saw a video from a debate at a Shanghai meetup. They totally framed the thing like it was "the two sides" and "we have to take control of development from core" (as if it is not the economic majority that decides already and as if there was another team of bitcoin experts ready to replace core anywhere).

I believe that most are already convinced or on their way to. There are probably many reasons why miners haven't adopted SegWit yet: laziness, ineptitude, deliberation, viewing this as a political game and trying to wean some kind of power out of this situation, fear of being then first one to make a decision, wanting to see how fee markets develop, etc., etc. Even Roger ver isn't _against_ SegWit, he's just trying to weasel in 2mb hard fork on the way.
I just don't see how you can conclude that there is no way to get SegWit when (you agree) there shouldn't be any way to not get SegWit and just a month and a half has passed. 
Has someone said publicly: "we will never ever implement SegWit"?

I'm sceptical about that until I start seeing good quotes backing that up.
Personally, I believe that it could be possible that some miners are looking at this chart:  
...and that they are thinking something along the lines that there is **no immedieate hurry** to activate SegWit right now. Maybe they are simply curious to keep watching how the fee market develops before they rush to increase the amount of transactions possible to include per block. But this is just speculation. 
@_date: 2016-12-30 20:51:03
There aren't two camps. We're all a bunch of people who want to see bitcoin succeed and hence we're forced to use logic.

There is definitely a balance to be struck in terms of block size and transaction fees. I believe miners understand that and that is why they haven't already made their own 2mb hard fork. The transaction fee market that has developed is clearly healthy. No miner will stand to gain from blocking technical improvements when they know more adoption will make up for the slightly added block space.

Look. You can't stop Bitcoin. It just isn't possible the way it is designed. And even if you did actually manage to stop it, through enormous amounts of effort, something else (that would be even harder to stop) would spring to replace it.
Legalising and regulating (including harm reduction measures) recreational drugs is probably the best thing you can do to stop addiction. That would also seriously curb darknet markets.
When it comes to carfentanil and other insanely deadly shit, all I can say is that insanely deadly things like guns are regularly sold to people just like that...and then they can go and shoot up a school or something. Indeed, there are many dangerous things like bombs that can be made from regular items. It is literally child's play to make it and the recipes are all online. Should you ban chemistry then to stop this possibility?
I have a hard time seeing carfentanil being big business selling, but maybe there is a market for it. If you remove the incentive to buy recreational drugs from darknet markets though, they will seriously lose their appeal. 
I'm not rationalising, I'm providing solutions. You're just upset.

Agreed. We need cellphone nodes. That could happen the way we are going, but we need Moore's law to catch up with node requirements if this is going to be a reality.
There is a theory, though, that miners will re-decentralize once they hit Moore's law and start scaling at the same rate as normal CPUs instead of doubling in hashpower twice a year. That has happened, and the effects will take time to spread.
Once SegWit is activated and ASICboost is out of the way, this will again lead to less centralization pressure in mining. 
Finally, the uneven distribution of electricity costs will also play a big role in spreading out mining geographically.

Gold doesn't need to be secured by mining. Bitcoin does. Total mining reward (mining subsidy + transaction fees) will need to be a fraction of the bitcoin network's market cap to make an attack unprofitable. 
We are already having transaction fees in bitcoin terms equal to what the mining subsidy will be after the 4th halving. 
Some people estimate that we need 3-4% of the total market cap in total block reward (fees + mining subsidy) to keep the network safe. Maybe the real figure is 1% - I don't know (but with 4 halvings, mining subsidy will be at 0.2% of market cap, and if transaction fees increase about 2.3x in bitcoin terms from today, then we will be at 1%). 
1% of a 10trillion market cap (with 20,5m coins in 2030) is 100bn per year.

Your point is still pretty much invalid. Credit cards prove that people don't mind spending 2.5% on transactions. The thing with Bitcoin is that you get censorship resistance, no counterparty risk and a flat fee. We're still miles away from that point and even if it happens at some point, even by then not many people are going to need censorship resistance, no counterparty risk or flat fees at so low payments. Besides, if it does happen before lightning, even after segregated witness is deployed...then it will be only for a short while, and it won't be a bad thing that Bitcoin is popular.

The argument will be that companies need ways to hide transactions from competitors. Governments can say that only they will be able to see the true identity, but that is simply not true as pretty much every NSA backdoor is systematically being used by China to spy on American companies. Since Bitcoin is permissionless by nature, if a multinational gets confidential transactions, then a single individual will also get it. 
As Andreas Antonopoulos said: "I would argue that if you cant buy drugs with your money, then its not actually money!"
The great thing about Bitcoin's nature is that it makes it almost impossible to escape or hide basic economic truths.  If money becomes impossible to use illegally, it will also lose its value eventually. And with open, decentralized, permissionless currencies, eventually means basically instantly. 
But hey, governments can try to go further down the path of centralization and police state. The thing is that with such a globally integrated world it will be almost impossible to plug all the holes...so it won't last as long as the Soviet Union. And even the SU was completely unable to dominate the entire world...or even effectively protect its borders (at a time when people didn't really know the truth about what was going on outside...now people almost everywhere effectively have an idea, making it 1000x harder).
I believe that governments efforts will be hopelessly slow to react to these newer paradigms as they are stuck in the old master-slave paradigm and simply cannot fathom or understand p2p.

I see Ayn Rand as a fiction writer, just like Heinlein. Great interesting stuff, meant to inspire you to think for yourself...not ideologies to be followed (on this ground alone, I reject objectivism without having really looked into it. My favorite Rand-novel was The Fountainhead...inspiring my handle, but without putting too much thought into what it means). 
As for terms and boxes to put around oneself, what do you think about the term Voluntaryism?  
At least it *sounds* better. But I don't care so much about that, what is important is the meaning people put into the terms *they are* using. 
A friend of mine said that the only "right" or "law" is the survival of the fittest/strongest, and that property rights isn't actually a natural right. But it *is* a way for humans to establish some kind of communication without killing one another. So at its very basic, property rights are actually more a cooperative tool through the implicaction of the market than an individual right. 
I always believed that anarchists on the so-called "left" and anarchists on the so-called "right" have far more in common than statists at the "centre". In fact, I believe that so-called "leftist" anarchists could exist completely fine within a so-called "rightist" or anarcho-capitalist system. They don't preclude one another. 
Another friend of mine told me that when you get a bunch of anarchists together they will start fighting between themselves about who is the real anarchist rather than cooperating.

I'm not saying it is completely black and white. In reality most Germans back in the day didn't do anything to oppose the opressive murderous regime, just like most Americans don't do anything to oppose it today. I consider it immoral, but it is a sliding scale because the world is exceedingly complex. Are you saying that you are starving and that is why you are paying your taxes? Look, I'm saying that as an individual it is a sliding scale...almost all choices are bad, but the best would clearly be to not pay tax and not vote. Do you disagree with that?
My point is that by voting you basically cannot vote for one thing only. You might vote for the George W. Bush if you want less taxes, but then you will by extension also vote for more for intervention and more war...for example. Unless you agree 100% with everything a politician does and you vote for that person, then you are enabling them to do all those things you disagree with. That is the whole problem with democracy: 


By your logic, if a company pays $5bn in taxes, then they should increase government programs to the tune of $20bn so that they can get 25% of that extra government money, costing the whole country $20bn. The problem is they are not lobbying the government to minimize their taxes. They are lobbying the government to give them money. That money has to come from somewhere, which is higher taxes on everyone else. That is theft. They are increasing the size of government to get less taxes for themselves. Do you understand that simply paying less taxes is not lobbying for more government and hence one isn't responsible for the other things that are paid? 


But they are not just getting handouts, they are lobbying for more handouts at the same time as they are campaigning for less handouts to other companies and people. Can't you see the duplicity in this? 


Well it is Ellsworth Toohey-style...not relying on logic, put on propaganda and manipulation.




I'm not moving the goalpost at all. You were the one who claimed that all rich people are by definition a paragon of morality because they are rich. Then you linked to the list of the world's richest and asked which of them had basically employed stealing to gain their wealth. I provided other examples than the Koch brothers. I also said that not all rich people steal to gain wealth, but some or even many do. 


Some of them are useful products, sure. But fertilizers, for example, is a product in demand due to the incompetence of a crumbling system. Regardless, if they are making all those useful products, why do they see the need to lobby the government when they can just let the products and their work speak for themselves? 
What I'm saying is that we can't really know how the Koch brothers operate, especially because they do so much PR control.

I'm speaking as someone with so low living costs that I don't need to make a million bucks a year just to survive, nor even ten thousand. I'm sure that to you, it is all about making the maximum amount of money and screw the rest. 
I'm exaggerating, of course, but reading her mission statement I understood that part of what she wanted to do was to be as far away from all the shit as possible. Then you come and say, "then you won't be successful, please reconsider your mission" which by implication basically implies the following: "and by the way, what's the point of making unique jewellery, you might as well just make more of the more popular models and make more money, and while you're at it, just use lower quality materials, and outsource the manufacturing to somebody else so you can increase the volume...". It is fine by me to warn people that their turnover might be small with doing things this way, but to say as a statement of authority that you won't be successful with a bitcoin-only business is false. Bitcoin Trezor is a testament to the opposite, even though they lose out on a lot of customers who want to buy a Trezor before they get Bitcoin. Another example were all the sellers on SilkRoad who sold the same products that one could buy elsewhere for fiat. And besides, what does it mean to be successful? Is it only measured in money or can it be measured in personal satisfaction as well? Furthermore, maybe we are at the eve of a lot more business being able to run Bitcoin only...who are you to say that that time isn't coming very soon?
I for one am interested in something unique, to me businesses that only accept Bitcoin is a feature of a product, because I loathe the current unsustainable system. Furthermore, there are many businesses that have been successful in selling stuff, even if there are hurdles for customers to go through...part of the appeal of these products are that they are exclusive. I'm not saying it will be easy to make a ton of money by only accepting bitcoin, but I'm not going to say don't do it, but rather give helpful advice on how it might be possible.

The price of bitcoin determines the value of the reward for securing the network (mining reward). 
The value of the mining reward determines how much electricity miners will purchase and consume.
Until we have fusion, we have a finite amount of energy. If the bitcoin network starts consuming very significant amounts of world electricity production, there will be a limit to how much price can rise.

Lightning network would increase transaction fees on the bitcoin blockchain because LN transactions just settle on the bitcoin blockchain, one settlement from LN on the bitcoin blockchain could represent a million transactions worth many millions in total. 
People sending a transaction with LN would not pay high fees, but the resulting bitcoin transaction that represents a large amount of LN transactions would pay a high fee.
edit: but of course, actual transaction fees on the bitcoin network might not be as high as block reward is today. But they would have to make up for some of the shortfall so that the network is secure. Which again will use up a large amount of electricity if the price is high enough.

The efficiency of ASICs is totally irrelevant. If 1 piece of mining hardware produces 1 hash, and needs $1 worth of energy for that, then $100 total reward (fees + miner subsidy) will tend towards creating 100 pieces of mining equipment as miners compete about reducing fixed costs and capital costs associated with mining. If a new generation of ASICs come out where 1 piece of mining hardware produces 2 hashes for $1 worth of energy, then the old ASICs will be turned off and the mining market will trend towards 100 pieces of the new type of ASICs, still consuming $100 worth of energy (but consuming twice as many hashes, which will be adjusted for with increased difficulty requiring more hashes to get the same portion of the total reward). 
So let's say that overnight, total reward goes up 100x due to massive increase in price. Miners will have a total of $10 000 in rewards to share for which they pay only $100 in electricity, making $9900 in profits. Everybody and their grandmother will do whatever they can to get their hands on a miner, and eventually enough miners will be produced to use up $10 000 worth of electricity. 
Even with another, third generation of ASICs, where 1 piece of hardware produces 3 hashes for $1 worth of energy, miners will in total buy a number of miners approaching 10 000, creating 30 000 hashes, sharing the reward equally among the hardware pieces that consume an amount of electricity approaching $10 000.
Miners profits trend towards zero over the long term (because it is an example of perfect competition in economic theory where each product is perfectly substitutable), even though they might have short periods of windfall profits. They use their windfall profits to buy new miners until rewards = electricity costs and they no longer can afford to buy new miners.


According to this calculation, Bitcoin mining power consumption was around half that of New York City by January this year:  
As price increases and mining reward increases, electricity consumed by mining will continue to increase, regardless of how effective mining chips are (miners will then just get more chips). 


That would make mining insanely profitable, and people would be continuously be trying to buy more and more mining hardware forever. 
Either price (and hence mining reward) would have to decrease, or there would eventually be enough chips produced to use up enough electricity to cover the increase in mining reward that resulted from the price increase.

If the total block reward (miner subsidy + fees) is x btc, and the value of x btc is double, then the value of the block reward also doubles.
If the total block reward halves, and the price of Bitcoin doubles, then the dollar amount spent on total block reward stays the same. But in this case, the relative security of the network is less and an attack more economical.

...and we could see price competition between bitfury and bitmain. It would definitely be beneficial.
So the chips themselves are dirt cheap per unit when bought in bulk from a semiconductor foundry like TSMC. But these guys only sell in bulk, and you need to bring them the chip's hardware designs which isn't that hard to do but you need someone who understands chip design and you need to do a lot of testing. 
When you see Bitmain's astronomical miner prices, it is because, capital costs, assembling (PSU, heatsink, fan, etc.), shipping, customer service is very expensive and a huge headache. 
Bitfury doesn't want to get that headache themselves (just like TSMC) but if someone orders one of their huge units they do offer full service, running and maintenance included.
I'm sure anyone can contact bitfury, order large amounts of chips, assemble them into miners and sell them to customers for profit. But the problem is that when you have done all of that, it is far more profitable to just mine yourself than to sell to individual miners (unless you sell at sky high prices like bitmain does).
Everyone was would love to see mining decentralise, but for that to happen, the economics need to change. If it was possible to organise an open source chip design, making it easier for anyone to order chips from a chipfab, it could help (but who would pay for that design? And what if someone improved on the design and kept it secret?). But the economics is still in favour of bulk orders, when it comes to the actual chips, their assembly, handling customers and capital costs/risk. 
So until you find a way to sort out all those issues and change the incentives, it is going to be hard to re-decentralise mining.

That is a generalization. You have to realize that many, if not most, rich people today owe their wealth due to one or another way of using force, either through government or through their own means. But some rich people have earned their wealth through the value of their own work or through voluntary exchange with other people. These people don't *take* money from others. Of course, the world isn't completely black and white and there are endless shades of grey. To me, Bill Gates, worth approx $100bn is a parasite and a taker, but Linus Thorvalds, at a more modest $100m is someone who has created his own wealth. However, it is not the relative wealth difference between them that is the cause of the difference in their moral character.
The people who create their own wealth, instead of stealing it from others are not likely to take much pleasure in their wealth for the sake of wealth (and by extension power for the sake of power), but rather they take pleasure in creating. 
Critizising people just because they are rich and not because of their low moral character implies jealousy, which in itself implies a low moral character. Because life isn't all about money, even though many people believe that – both rich and poor.

I imagine the typical money laundering scenario of someone who has a bunch of cash, illegally gained, then they go and buy some gift cards and get bitcoin. Then what? They still don't have a bunch of money with a legal status. I mean, they would have to first lose 30%, in addition to whatever exchange rate risk...and for what exactly? Why wouldn't these people just buy smaller amounts of bitcoin for cash on localbitcoin or atms with no ID requirement for smaller purchases?  
Could you please explain to me a scenario where it would make sense for someone to use Purse to launder money?

They will tend to spend approaching 100% on resources for proof of work. Main resource at the moment is electricity, might be chip materials in the future. 
Maybe one day capital or labour will be the bottleneck.
But my point is actually more about mining consuming a significant portion of total resources and becoming a hindrance to other activities. That would limit Bitcoin price increase.

What I'm saying is that the sales price of a miner is comprised of the following elements:
1. Cost of chip design and testing
2. Cost of chips
3. Cost of assembling chips into functioning miner (complete with heat sink, PSU, fan, etc.)
4. Cost of customer service to individual customers
5. Capital costs and risk
6. Profit for miner vendor
Nobody knows exactly what costs 1-5 are and bitmain obviously wants people to think this is really high so that they can get away with getting the highest possible profit (6.) as a percentage of the sales price. This is the same for any mining vendor. Therefore bitmain posts their official price at a few percent below the lowest official price of other vendors. People who don't know anything about what the costs 1-5 are will pay the lowest official price posted. But people who have some insight into how much the costs 1-5 are in reality are in a position to negotiate lower prices with bitmain or whatever other vendor they have. Bitmain would benefit from this negotiation to start as high as possible so they can claim they have super high costs and therefore cannot afford to sell you a miner at lower prices. It is up to you to call their bluff and negotiate a better price. But nobody knows exactly at what price bitmain would cover their costs 1-5 at, so bitmain has every incentive in the world to enshroud those numbers as much as possible and pretend that costs are higher than they are.
The cost isn't known now. We just know that one company paid about half the official price (but they bought miners without PSUs), this shows that Bitmain's profit margin 6 is fairly high on the official price. All we know is that their costs of 1-5 is less than whatever this company paid...but they could still be even lower than what they paid.

But total mining reward is composed of mining subsidy + transaction fees. As the subsidy decreases, transaction fees are expected to increase to make up for the shortfall.
How much is spent on gold mining per year?
@_date: 2017-04-13 20:06:35
Well, it depends on what astronomically high fees are. 
Let's say that total collected fees increase 10x from now (but with SegWit and Schnorr, we are able to send 5x as many transactions) that means one transaction would cost 2x more than today. You could settle 8 times per year for about $10. 
If total transaction fees rose 10x, they would be as high as mining subsidy is today. 
In addition, there are a whole host of other layer two technologies that further change the picture.

As far as I understand, we are talking about 7 out of a large group who are employed by Blockstream. They are hired for their technical competence, and part of their salary is in time locked Bitcoin. Many other companies benefit from Bitcoin's Blockchain but are not interested in hiring anyone who supports the actual codebase, though they are more than happy to push for solutions that throws out the entire proven team in favour of one unproven team after another. As far as I understand Blockstream hires these people to build technologies utilizing the Bitcoin network and pays them in a way that gives them an incentive for Bitcoin to succeed long term. Blockstream doesn't direct their activities in contributing core code.

I mean that at a very high price, the amount of electricity needed to secure the network might be so high that certain price levels are unsustainable. 
Sure, the mining subsidy will decrease, but transaction fees are expected to at least make up for some of the shortfall. If they don't, then the network won't be properly secure. 
All I'm saying is that the electricity generating power of the world will put a limit on how high the price can go. Maybe making $500k per coin impossible.

Thanks for the thoughtful and well argued reply.
I used to agree with this reasoning, but I don't anymore. I do agree though, that from some viewpoints, this is less inefficient government spending than many other types of government spending. And if I was cutting in government spending it would not neccesarily be the first place I would cut. 
First of all, let's look at the cost to society, it would likely far more than the actual cost of the daycare itself. Think of the administration costs of the program and the costs of administrating the administrators.
Also, what is the true cost of daycare per day? I know that in Norway, childcare is regulated in such a way that there should be a maximum of 8 children per daycare worker...in practice though, one of the people might be sick or not able to be there the whole day. But let's take the regulations by their word...one person can take care of 8 children. What is the salary needed for a daycare worker? Let's use the median salary in Canada for 2013, which is CAD $32k per year (source:  And what could a woman expect to make from going to work? Let's say CAD $32k. In a completely free market, there would not be much administration cost or taxes, so the cost of day care would be CAD $20 per day (assuming 200 daycare days and 200 work days). 
I believe the government subsidized daycare costs more than that, due to administration costs outlined above instead of just having a person doing it, or cooperating with people in the neighbourhood for this. I mean think of the expense of renting daycare facilities isntead of using the empty houses while parents are at work. 
It would be difficult for them to influence that as the government is paying for it and mandating everything through a complex bureaucracy. Then think of the costs associated with raising the taxes needed to subsidize child care and child care bureaucracy. Probably, the total bill for government subsidized daycare is several multiples of $13. Then think of if the government subsidized daycare does something parents don't like, and if that influences the child's development and creates a loss for that child later in life. 
Of course, part of this could be solved by using a voucher system where you just hand that money to parents and they can cash it in at daycare. Still, there are costs associated with raising taxes. So it still only makes economic sense to parents as long as the people who don't have children in daycare help pay for people who do. And technically it was the parents choice to get the child in the first place. 
But the whole idea is that the woman who otherwise would be staying at home, would then be using other government services (like roads) without paying any tax at all because she would not be working. So it only makes economic sense for the government to pay for this, since they already are paying for so many other things.
It does get a little complicated and I must admit I'm not so good at laying out my thinking clearly. But bear with me, the above are just economical details. 
Contrary to social democratic propaganda, I've come to believe that there is not much ethical need to work in the first place. That the main reason that governments want to get women to work is because they will have another milking cow for their militaryindustrial complex and self-serving bureaucracy. I believe that 40hrs of work per week should be more than enough to cover the needs of one family. In fact, it should be more like 10-20hrs. Ideally, those working hours should be shared by both parents...and both parents should also share in the raising of the child, as well as ideally their extended family and the rest of their community. The reality is that we now have families putting in 80hrs or more, and they hardly get time to spend with their offspring. That is only profitable for the state that wants obedient citizens that do not have the time to think for themselves. 
I know this line of thinking needs a lot more work. But I'm pretty sure that even daycare is inefficient use of governent resources as long as the government raises its money from taxes because that distorts the market as it is based on using force to extract the money. Naturally, I do support a completely free market, so that would be a world with absolutely no regulatory barriers between people to allow them to organise optimally in a voluntary way.
Hope this makes some sense.

Do you have access to the first article cited [9]? 
I don't feel like paying $38 at jstor: 
First of all, in my book, corruption is far more than black market activity (you have corporate corruption scandals of bribery abroad, ministerial corruption scandals with handing contracts to preferred companies, the 30 or so consultancy companies basically slowing down and between them deciding the fate of any government project, you have the process of how they choose which type of asphalt to pave the roads with, you have appointments of politicians in all sorts of positions as favours rather than because they are skilled for that position (see asphalt type choice)). Secondly, I would *really* like to see how they measure overabundance of regulation. Thirdly, I notice that the the highest significance was on RGDP/Cap, which supports my theory of a self-congratulatory feeling of superiority. 
Yes it is difficult to measure corruption, but I'm pretty damn sure that people in Scandinavia understimate the amount of corruption in their own countries (many people don't even know that cronyism is corruption) *and* that the CPI is not the be-all and end-all of corruption comparisons.
Still, counting for all of those factors, it could be that Scandinavia is one of the least corrupt places on earth...but there are big, big maybes. I mean why do island communities of something like 1000 people get a bridge connection costing $150m? Sounds fishy.

@_date: 2017-04-14 21:19:58


What makes you say that? Bitcoin has been working for 8 years, it is proving to be one of the most, if not the most secure thing the world has ever seen.
PoS cannot work, and there is plenty of stuff out there about why it doesn't work. As for other things that work just as well as PoW, I just can't see what it would be (it definitely isn't Casper or PoS-based) - but if someone finds it, it will be a paradigm shift. 
You're more than welcome to try to find a PoW replacement, but there is no reason for you to hope that Vitalik will find it when other people have explained why what he's doing is pointless and all he does with that criticism is waffle waffle or just ignore it.
Vitalik just got in way over his head and promised a whole bunch of things that turned out was a little (actually a lot) more complicated than he thought. 
There is a reason all the most talented coders are working on Bitcoin - it is the only game in town (though there are a couple of projects that could be contenders if Bitcoin went down).

Me too. It *has* to be completely unsustainable for most of them. Probably about too much hype. I remember an interview when Patrick Byrne talked about how he struggled to get funding for Overstock back before the IT bubble because he didn't include any hype but was talking about sober business practices, about buying stuff at other companies excess stock at a low price and selling it to customers at also a low price after having taken a cut. Obviously Byrne was right since Overstock has grown year on year since then, whereas most of the hype internet companies went bust. 
Blockstream though seems to be less about hype than many other companeis, they have only spend half their original VC investment. They pushed forward their plan to get the next round of investment not because they ran out of money, but because they need more capacity due to huge demand. Seems like sober business practice to me.

If they are making too much money, there will be some greedy fuckers with enough knowledge and financing somewhere who will try to get a hold of a piece of the pie. My point is that over time, enough mining hardware will be produced to gobble up increasing amounts of energy. Remember, we are already past **half of NYC** in power consumption if the picture I linked to with calculations is correct.


Power is never totally free. Some might obtain it for free, but that just means someone else is paying for it. In the long term, that's not sustainable.


I understand. But the lower the price per kWh, the more power will be required by miners -- but I think you're saying that we will run out of materials to make chips from before we run out of electricity. 
That's a fair argument. That chip prices will rise before electricity prices. 
But that will make computing power expensive.
Or conversely, if we start running out of electricity, then electricity prices will rise. 
Neither situation is particularly good. 
Or is what you are saying that electricity prices will infinitely decrease (for example through fusion power), and we will get access to more materials to make chips from (through space mining) so that the bottleneck will be actually bothering to make the chips and run them to perform proof-of-work.
It would be great if you could explain a little more about what you mean so that I can understand why you think what I'm saying is ridiculous. If Bitcoin truly will swallow all value, then understanding how that will affect the mining incentives is *really* important.

False. Like any tool it is being used for that by some people. The whole point is that it is designed to be able to be used by anyone for whatever they please.


Bullshit. Running a bitcoin node does not mean you endorse crime. Coding for Bitcoin does not mean you endorse crime.


With any open, permissionless and uncensorable system you can't clean it up. 
By your logic, anything that can be used for crime is designed to be used for crime. 


Blocks aren't clogged, they are mostly filled up and people pay transaction fees to use the block space. This is working exactly like designed.


Nobody can deny this is happening. But so what? Some of these mixed coins might be used for crime, others for anonymity for perfectly legitimate actions. You make it out like anyone who desires privacy is automatically a criminal. This is wrong on so many levels. In fact, privacy is vital for democracy to function properly.
Finally, the definition of crime is relative to what code of morality you subscribe to. You don't have to be convicted to be a criminal - several members of the US government could be argued to be war criminals while many people who are convicted of this that or the other haven't harmed anyone. 
A criminal in one country can be a victim in another.

Either you are exaggerating/misrepresenting or you are talking to idiots. 


Yes, they can trace and hack anyone, regardless of if they use Tor or not.


If you read that link, you will see that Tor is both a Honeypot, but also something that could be useful. It's not like they can just snap their fingers and see all of the Tor traffic, but obviously intelligence agencies all over the world run Tor servers and try to snoop from the traffic. 
Just because the government funded Tor, doesn't mean it was created to be a honeypot. It was created to be an anonomyzing tool for the government to use, and for it to be useful they need other people to use it for that too. The truth is that the government wants Tor to be anonymizing enough (for their own purpouses), but not entirely so (so that it doesn't become a free for all total complete anonymity). It is more than good enough for buying drugs. 
As for bitcoin being created by the government. There is no evidence for it, and any such allegation is a total and complete conspiracy theory - end of story. That said, lots of people in the bitcoin community have been talking about this specific conspiracy for years. However, who created bitcoin is totally, completely and utterly irrelevant. 
Finally, I don't understand why you are so against bitcoin. It is just a tool that can be used by anyone, just like a pen can be used for both horrible acts and great ones.

Yes, I'm aware that the mining subsidy goes down, but presumably, transaction fees are meant to make up for (at least some of) the shortfall here.

It's impossible to make it hard. 
The point is that the harder you try to squash something like that out, the hydra comes back with more heads. The more you try to control drugs, the more money can be made by pushing it and the more harm you cause.
The way to make our kids safe is to try to educate them by showing them how dangerous opioids are. Real, realistic, non-moralising stories about opioids is the best way. A good example is cigarettes, cigarette consumption is going down because people realised it was actually dangerous. And the kids are hardly smoking nowadays, they think it's stupid an smelly.  
Some people think it is criminally insane that any person in the US can go into a store and just buy a gun. Same with knives, we let our kids be around knives, even though they can be used to kill someone. 
Yes it is a brave new world out there, but the first thing we can hope for is that out of all the stupid mistakes one can make in a lifetime (and humans are meant to make mistakes), kids realise that getting addicted to opioids is one of the worst. At the end of the day, we can't remove all of the risks from society. But what we can do is try to teach people to choose not to make the worst mistakes.
Actually, there's more we can do. We can help treat the addicted, we can have more social workers out there to help people who feel low - especially before they do something stupid. Research shows that addicts need love if they are going to have any hope of getting better.
In fact, if we legalised all drugs, we could lower the incentives to push drugs further. Also we could provide better information (ie warnings on the package like with cigarettes). Make it easier to find and help those in need (ie less stigma would also reduce fear about seeking help). Check ages of whomever buys drugs. In fact, we could also tax them a little to finance social work to combat harm. We could regulate doses so that overdose deaths become abolished (they have abolished overdose deaths in Switzerland and Netherlands where they have a program where the heaviest addicts get free heroin from the government when they enroll in the program) because kids like in the video above often overdose because they don't know the exact purity and make a mistake with the doses. 
This is not an exhaustive list. 
But the point is that addiction to drugs is a medical condition and not a criminal one. Hence we should decriminalise user doses and try to help people more.
Full legalisation is something we need because we cannot stop drugs from being available online or on the street. So since we can't stop it we have to make it legal, but under certain conditions and then we set those conditions to minimise harm. 
This is the way to reduce drug addiction.
Leaving drug selling to the drug pushers on the darknet markets who sell whatever to whomever is criminally insane when people could buy it from a pharmacy with certain safeguards put in place instead (and we could collect tax dollars from that that we use to help those who get in trouble).
We all agree that kids taking opioids is a bad thing.
It's just that we've tried to stamp it out for 40 years and it just keeps getting worse. Whereas some countries try a different tack, and they are making progress. So the evidence shows that there is another way to reduce drug abuse, harm and addiction that actually works. 
Don't you agree that we should try something that actually works?

I love this idea. Life is not all about maximizing profit. Only accepting Bitcoin and only selling designs once is admirable, in fact the whole concept speaks about quality and dignity. 
You probably won't get as many sales in the beginning using this strategy, but you will be able to hold your head raised high. That is a feeling that money can't buy. 
I have two pieces of advice. 
1) have extremely low living costs (read the book Early Retirement Extreme by Jakob Lund Fisker for advice on how to think to achieve this) so that you can survive without having to sell so much and that you can keep your principles (you might need to count on having a side income in the beginning).
2) there is nothing wrong with having very high margins. Hey Apple has high margins, Tesla motors have high margins, don't be shy, it is the only way you can make money at low volumes and it shows that you believe in your products.
Ps. also you have to sell your products on openbazaar once it comes online.
Pps. sometimes having the balls to tell potential customers that they have to pay in Bitcoin and that their fiat scrip is useless to you will get you attention and show that your products are unique and exclusive. So go out and sell your products to friends fools and family, use social media, contact traditional media go at it with your guns blazing and make sure you have the financial situation to stick it out for the long haul.

Bitcoin changes this by allowing poor people to accumulate as well. 


I don't think it is up to some*one* to find that balance, because one person or a group of people (even a majority of people) will always strike that balance wrongly. I think it is up to the market, which is the sum of the wants and desires of everyone without the force of someone else deciding what is best for them. 


Possibly. But no matter how rich you are, you will only be able to convince people who are willing to sell out their principles to help you cause that mess. Socialism is about changing peoples principles to convince them that it is ok to use force in other people's best interest.


Nobody is sure that it would be "better" as defined by you or me in the short term. But we can be sure that we aren't using force to tell other people what to do...and surely that will be better in the long term. 
The internet makes it extremely difficult to monopolize information and hence average Joe will catch up much quicker, in fact, average Joes are numerically surperior to the elite rich then they can cooperate on finding out how to get out of the sinkhole. Every strategy has a weakness and eventually it will be found, even by average Joe...as long as we don't base ourselves on using force because that will corrupt people and in the end cement elites and prevent average Joe from arising.

Yes, I'm just trying to say that there might be some physical limits to how much the price of Bitcoin can increase. The exact quantitative details are totally secondary.




I imagine some will be fore fixed costs (buildings and geeks to run the miners), some for capital costs (financing miners) and the rest for electricity. You are correct that the other costs will approach zero, though of course it is hard to imagine them being exactly zero. I don't know if in reality it will be 50%, 75% or 95%  of the reward spent on electricity. And it doesn't really matter.




More energey efficient hardware would just result in more hardware being bought and hence more electricity consumed.


I agree that demand for Bitcoin will determine the price. But I also doubt that the world will ever have mining consume HUGE, amounts of it's electricity.

Precisely! The security of the network depends on the total reward (mining subsidy + transaction fees) relative to the market cap. Right now, we are around 4% per year. As mining subsidy decreases, I expect transaction fees to make up at least part of the shortfall as a portion of the total market cap. 
If transaction fees don't do that, then bitcoin will be less and less secure because even if a price increase of bitcoin will make sure the fiat value of the mining reward stays high or even increases, the total market cap (and hence the reward for cheating the system) increases more. 
I believe total transaction fees will increase, though not necessarily fee per user transaction (through more transactions made per block b/c SegWit + Schnorr and layer 2 technologies like Lightning Network).
Some people estimate that we need to spend as much as 3-4% of market cap per year to make it unprofitable enough to attack the network. Maybe we need to spend less (edit: but it is still a relative portion denominated in bitcoin).
@_date: 2016-02-09 23:46:57
In many cases and countries the fee does get charged to customers though. Besides, people could just research where all the rewards come from. I think many people know, and if they don't...they're not unlikely to be straddled with credit debt anyway and wouldn't really be able to buy lots of Bitcoin. Besides, not many people use bitcoin for the primary use of shopping. If they use it to get discounts, then paying a small flat fee is not a problem. 
I agree that we want new users. But of the possible new users, are the people who rely on bitcoin for shopping $10 or less, the ones that will bring the most value to the network (they could easily switch to another payment network with low fees, because as you say they don't really know or care about anything)? 
The people who use bitcoin for its more unique properties are likely to be more sticky users and should be prioritized if you *have* to prioritize. That is what's happening. Those people who don't know and don't care can just use a third party, but why would they consider using something other than credit cards in the first place? Why go to the hassle of learning something new?
As for mass market application, bitcoin won't ever be able to fulfill that by only scaling block size.

You never post the real price on the website. Bitmain has the lowest official price posted and they're not going to lower it unless someone else posts a lower official price. If someone wants to buy miners from them and already have done the math so they know how much they cost to assemble and are buying in bulk and have an alternative, then it is a different story.

I believe so. But it would make you less so if you don't vote, for example. Also, finding ways to not pay taxes, or reducing your taxes would be good too. Keeping money in the bank is basically lending out money to a murderous thieving system and should be avoided too. Like in Nazi Germany, did all those people just following orders have no guilt at all? Look, we live in a world of greys...I pay taxes too, but if I find a way to get some of them back or pay less without going to jail, then I take it. All I'm saying is that as individuals we must try our best to insulate ourselves from the money flows that finance the oppressive system, but of course not to the exclusion of everything else either – we all have to find our own ethics in this. 
I'm not against companies trying to pay as little tax as possible, and they already do that. What I'm against is companies paying as little tax as possible, yet ignoring exorbitant tax rates for SMEs who can't afford an army of tax lawyers high...effectively blocking competition. 
I'm not against a company trying to lobby against a particular piece of onerous legislation that will screw up their business, but ones that seek to control more broadly or seek specific protection against competition from governments.  
The Koch brothers' lobbied for the Biomass Crop Assistance Program (BCAP) program (  ) which gave them government handouts from money that taxpayers like you and me pay. That is theft. 
Also, the Koch brothers are spending vast amounts on think tanks in Washington. If an idea is true, then it shouldn't require Koch money to become widespread.
edit: but these are all specific points. My more general point is that in the US and basically any country today, it is possible to make lots of money with coercion and deception...and many people do.

And what we have today is state capitalism. 
You have to call things what they are. You are doing the same things as the people who call the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel for the Nobel Prize in Economics even though Alfred Nobel never created a prize for economics in his will. Or the same people who claim that feminism is not about women's rights but about equality between sexes. 
In some contexts it is completely fine to use the regular misinformed shorthand, but in this subreddit you have to accept that people will be a bit more nitpicking. Of course, you don't have to accept it, but here a lot of people, including me, will try to call you out on such things because a lot of people here believe that these finicky details actually are important.
And in this view, what you call "capitalism of today" isn't capitalism, either you can call it state capitalism, socialism, bolshevism, fascism, crony capitalism, corporatism, neoliberalism or something like that – you have to call a spade for a spade. Calling what we have today simply "capitalism" is misrepresenting the oppression we have today as somehow related to freedom or free markets. *It is a newspeak way to subtley discredit markets when they in fact are the best way to allocate resources without opression.*
Anarcho-capitalists have a bad reputation because the name "capitalism" is being misused so much...that's why many people prefer to call themselves libertarians (I know there are many flavours and there are more specific definitions and subdivisions here as well). The truth of course is that Anarcho-capitalists can be just as nice and warm as other people, maybe even more so.

The combination of a vast countries with a small populationand lots of natural resources has definitely had something to do with it. Those things (wealth extraction), combined with private enterprise (wealth creation) is definitely the greatest source of wealth in Scandinavia. Governments in Scandinavia get in the way of wealth creation because they crowd out private enterprise with inefficiency and that is precisely the argument of the centre-right party in Sweden.
That being said, most other countries are socialist too, even though they like to call themselves capitalistic...I believe the better term is State Capitalism. It is just that if you are going to collect lots of taxes, it is far better to spend it on things that help the people in the country than to spend it on expensive wars in foreign countries...but that doesn't mean that collecting taxes is right or the best way to create a just an equal society. The end doesn't justify the means, and never will.

Nederhandal made a characterisation of Gavin, the only way he can justify that is with examples. I commented on the examples, and not the general characterisation of Gavin. 
You cherry picked the word "insult" from nederhandal's post, instead of looking at the broader meaning of what he was trying to say, that Gavin was deflecting technical discussion and being less than constructive, contributing to lowering the level of the discussion. I'm not familiar enough with Gavin's posting history in this time period to comment on that as a whole.
Reading your post it sounds like you make it out like Gavin has been acting perfectly reasonable, whereas the fact that he was pushing a 20mb cap is a point that puts doubt on that in my mind. As far as I understand, it turned out that it would have put the network at risk because the other improvements that would mitigate those risks weren't ready yet, or those improvements themselves had other possible flaws in them that weren't ironed out. In addition, Gavin went in full support of XT, which was another worrying sign because he had no qualms about leaving Mike Hearn as the main developer – if he was so reasonable, why wouldn't he support BIP 101 instead?

I believe you are mistaken here. 
The mining reward + transaction fees = total amount of money used to buy electricity used to perform the work that secures the network (or at least orders the transactions) = Security Money (SM)
The total market cap of bitcoin would be the prize, and the SM would be the cost that you have to overcome to win the prize. Hence, if SM becomes too low compared to the total market cap (ie the prize for attacking the network), then the network would not be secure as it would be profitable to attack it. 
Let's say that 1% of market cap is needed per year for SM (some people estimate we need more, like 3-4%) - it doesn't matter what proportion is miner subsidy and what proportion is transaction fees, this is the cost to securing the network from a 51% attack. 
So, a price of 500k means a market cap of 10.25 trillion in 2030 (with 20,5m coins). If 1% is needed to secure the network, then we need 102.5bn per year to do so. With an electricity price of 0.05/kWh, that means 2000tWh of electricity is needed to secure the network. By 2030, electricity production is forecasted to be 31 000tWh worldwide, and that means we need 6.6% of world electricity to secure the network. If we need 3% of market cap to secure the network, we need almost 20% of world electricity.

You welcome. 
The reason the figure is variable (2-3.7mb) is that some transactions have relatively more witness data than others, so a bigger proportion is separated out. 
Multisig transactions have more witness data relative to the rest of the transaction data. 
And witness data is just another word for signature data.

How is the system 'stuck' now? If you use high enough fees, your transaction will be handled in the next block. The block reward halving will cut miners' bitcoin reward in half. But the supply of new bitcoin will also be cut in half. So with the demand staying the same, the price will increase lots.

Segwit means that blocks are extended (the witness data is segregated, or separated out outside the block) in such away that would mean the equivalent of 2-3.7mb blocks without segwit. To fully verify everything in the blockchain you also need the witness data, so in effect, segwit is a block size increase even though the witness data isn't technically a part of the block.

Ah, I forgot, I have to call you out on the corruption part, because that is just plain wrong. It is an index of corruption perceptions and not corruption. It basically means that Scandinavian's assume that *their* countries are squeaky clean and that all the corruption is abroad. It is more a measure of naïveté, a self congratulatory feeling of superiority and the fact that corruption in Scandinavia usually involves 'favors' rather than grey envelopes with money. In the past few years, hardly any of the biggest companies in Norway have not been involved in a corruption scandal, this is also true for ministers in the government.

I would never buy stocks from those bloodsuckers. According to Patrick Byrne, owning stocks is just holding a contractual right to a contractual right to a contractual right to the actual stock. So you might end up getting screwed that way with stocks. 
My strategy is to buy and hold. Then as the price balloons again I will sell a certain percentage of my stash for gold just to retain some of the value in case the price dips back down for a year or two and I need to spend some money in the mean-time. When I reach 100 btc my goal is to then start diversifying into other things like these:
To my mind, good investments are investing in personal skills, bitcoin, land, precious metals, rare collectible items and art, cryptoequity that is provably yours in DAOs that you fully understand and vouch for what they do, donating to the right people.
Being afraid of losing your money in a bitcoin investment is kind of stupid if the alternative is holding stocks (which you actually don't hold but just have a contractual right to a contractual right to a contractual right to) in heavily indebted companies exposed to gigantic systemic risk.

You don't HAVE to run it as a wallet. You could also point your SPV wallet to your own node. So when you have an SPV wallet you basically have to trust the node you are connecting to not to screw you over and give you the wrong information about the blockchain (like tell you that you have received bitcoin, but you actually haven't). That's when you point your SPV wallets to your own node and you have verified yourself that the info is correct.
It makes a difference because you have an economical incentive, because you rely on your node and not someone else's to verify your transactions. It basically makes the network more robust because we then have one more participant that it is virtually impossible to screw over because they verify themselves.

No full blocks:

@_date: 2015-11-05 12:05:16


Yes. Which is why I'm not inclined to outright dismiss Theymos' decision as a mistake. Seeing the hostile, seemingly puppet-fueled "discussion" in this thread (you and a very few others have been trying to make reasonable explanations though), it makes me wonder what kind of forces are behind the call for bigger blocks now, and a trashing of the current review process. 
What I meant to point out is that trying to suggest a BIP that is uncontroversial from the beginning is encouraged here, and discussing possible downsides of keeping blocksize at 1mb is definitely a part of that and understanding how to make an uncontroversial BIP. 
But starting with something that **is** controversial for many, and then campaigning to get less than what has been normally agreed upon as consensus before to make a change, that is not part of a discussion on improving Bitcoin, but a campaign to break it. That is why this type of stuff is moderated here and that is not the same as this forum having a "political moderation policy to hide the downsides to users of keeping blocks small(er for longer)" (if there are any).
The more I've read about the scaling discussions, the more certain I've gotten that it is a fairly complex issue. And when faced with a complex issue, the right answer is not to run around like headless chickens screaming "larger blocks ASAP" and "screw the review process". 
What I was trying to say is that this reddit isn't politically censored by moderators (that I know of), it is under a sustained attack by someone who has an interest in breaking bitcoin's consensus by framing, confusing (and flooding) the discussion. 
The only thing that is censored here is campaigning for trying to break the consensus – breaking the consensus is pretty much my worst nightmare, and I understand where theymos is coming from. I just don't want people characterizing the moderation on this forum by saying that "real discussion is banned", when in fact the only thing that is banned is "divisive political campaigning aimed at destroying bitcoin".
@_date: 2015-11-02 23:46:11
That is the fundamental question. 
Also, the Bitcoin network is larger than just the miners.
Balancing the needs of the different stakeholders is clearly the way to give Bitcoin the most value. 
Consensus is what makes Bitcoin useful and valuable, trying to break that consensus with political campaigning to reach 75% of the miners will only destroy that usefulness and that value. 
What if people always have to worry about being in the 25% camp?
The whole XT-campaign reeks of rash (Gavin Andresen has said that he has based the numbers for blocksize increase and its schedule on back off the envelope calculations, and XT would be run by one benevolent dictator) collective action. If we seek out solutions that are palatable to ~100% of the community rather than saying 75% is enough, then Bitcoin will have far more credibility. Acting conservatively and trying to achieve consensus as overwhelming as possible should be our number 1 priority if we want to attract people who want put their money into Bitcoin for the long term.

I normally say something like that *I* believe that the enormous potential reward of Bitcoin means that it seems like a common-sense prudent financial judgement that almost anyone would benefit from putting a small amount of one's portfolio, say 1%, into it. It is kind of like a hedge against currency failure with fiat (recently most currencies are significantly down against the dollar btw). 
Then I follow up, with explaining how I'm almost all in (except a little cash and gold) for a different reason. I don't want to keep my money in the (banking) system because I don't want my money to be controlled by someone else and used to fund wars, I tell them about Greece and Cyprus...how when you have money in the bank, you don't really have it in the bank, but you are actually lending it out to the bank (for 0.01% interest), which lends it out again to the military industrial complex, coca-cola and the giant vampire squid Goldman Sachs.
I prefer declaring my honest opinion in front of people I consider my friends. It is up to them to do whatever they choose though, and I will certainly respect whatever they choose to do or try to answer any question they ask. 
It is important to remember to tell anyone that security is difficult and that there are no guarantees if something goes wrong and that it requires some time and effort to secure an initial investment properly.
I try to word it so that I'm not trying to *tell them to buy bitcoin* but rather explain my judgement of the situation and declare my bias. 
edit: if they are really close friends and family, I'm fighting the urge not to scream into their ears to buy a little bitcoin. It is because I worry about their safety if there is a problem with the current fiat system.

Criticism is good and it isn't banned here, it just has to be civil. 
Also, nothing has matched the order of magnitude security strength (and market cap) of the Bitcoin network. I think we can all work together, and leverage that.

Your post comes off a little panicky, on the verge of fear mongering. 
There is one point, though, that I do agree with. More people should have been working on sidechains or related (like tree chains, etc) ideas sooner. These type of things are a bit technically complicated - but so is it going to be to set up competing (and as or more) secure financial systems. But good luck getting that message out under the constant noise and FUD of the XT-shills. I think the Bitcoin ecosystem has become stronger and more resilient from that attack. As it stands today, Bitcoin is doing fine and dandy. Improvements are being made both to short term and longer term goals.  


Bullshit, LN disproves that. 


Wrong, LN is far from alone. You have...
Counterparty and Liquid. Oh, and then there is Confidential Transactions which will help protect the people who have a lot of Bitcoin from becoming kidnapped. By the way, A hedge fund recently borrowed $10m using t0 and the blockchain:  ...and of course there is Omni (formerly known as Mastercoin). I'm sure I've missed several projects.


If you thought that the change from the current banking system to the blockchain was going to happen in one quick snap, you have been caught up in all the hype. We have had the internet for more than 20 years, and print newspapers and print publishers are still dominating many markets.  


You have not pointed out any protocols even close to competing with Bitcoin, especially in security and scale. 


As I understand, one thing that is currently being done to improve the pace of innovation is to modularize different aspects of Bitcoin Core, making it easier for people to contribute to the code or just copy it wholesale into their application (like Armory did with consensus-related code). In other words, more coders will come to the project and find coding easier, so the answer is a hell of a lot could be done in the next 10 years.


Outside the west there is. Oh, and inside the west there is use for people who care about freedom. We are also seeing Bitcoin slowly starting to bust open markets like unused vouchers or foreign remittance. Also, Bitcoin is useful for those who are looking for long-term store of value/investments. Then there are people under the age of 18 who in many places can't open their own bank accounts.

I fully agree that there is very important to compromise, but only if there is a debate to compromise.
You are unfortunately misunderstanding the issue. You simply state that there are perfectly safe ways to have big blocks. By that you mean that there are perfectly safe ways to have big blocks if you accept a significant decrease in the network's decentralisation. But accepting that, you might as well just go all the way to the logical conclusion and use PayPal instead. 
It is a philosophical issue in the sense of if you need blocks, proof of work, permissonlessness, immutability...or if you can just make do with a  database, which is the ultimate layer one scaling technique. The thing is that we already​ have those kind of payment networks so there is no point of turning Bitcoin into that.
It is not possible to compromise when there is no other point to compromise with. 
Who has been acting like petulant children? It's definitely not the people supporting that we stick with core's roadmap and world class peer review process. That process is the compromise we all made and what has gotten us safely thus far and can guide us safely on for much longer. We shouldn't undermine that process.
Anyway, the proposal that luke wrote (but didn't support) here would not help with on chain layer one scaling any more than segwit +1mb at all because weight is still at 4mb. It just makes it a little more economical with simple non-multisig transactions. Probably won't change anything as multisig transactions for layer 2 solutions will probably pay higher fees and price out layer 1 transactions regardless.
At least if we're going to do a hard fork we should implement some things from the hard fork wish list instead of just changing the blocksize. Segwit+2mb is pointless. But hard forks should be avoided if possible. 
So it's not philosophical, there is no debate to settle, there is nothing to compromise with and by accepting a nonsense suggestion we just start degrading the consensus and compromise based approach that we have in the peer review process.
It would be a great shame to let childish, populist trolls who refuse to budge get their way in ruining a grown-up, level-headed compromise.

As far as I understand. Central banks can QE all they want, which lowers the long term yields in the repo market - but that will hardly help if no one will accept the collateral banks have to borrow in the repo market. 
Also, it is questionable if the Fed will be able to raise the interest rate, if they want to do that: 
Fundamentally, what is needed to prevent another severe meltdown is more high-quality collateral. But there is no way to create more of that without growth. 
Especially considering that the 50 companies are essentially in control of 40% of the world (see page 33  ). This means that the entities that want collateral already have exposure to almost any collateral already through the network of government control. Furthermore, this means that accepting any of those shares as collateral will increase their systemic risk and not act as a collateral at all (which is exactly what they are trying to avoid in the middle of a credit crunch).
Considering the difficulties of holding physical gold, I think that it does make sense for banks and companies to keep a little bit of Bitcoin as hardly any assets are worth anything in a financial crisis.

Your argument is sound except for one thing. It hinges on the miner actually selling the mined Bitcoin. Consider the following scenario:
A big miners knows they can keep on operating for some time coming. They intentionally depress the price by blocking segwit temporarily and hoard Bitcoins meanwhile. Then they turn around and signal segwit, causing price to skyrocket. 
Having this knowledge of an event before it's going to happen allows the miner to profit from the asymetry of knowledge.

Thanks for the support! That actually means a lot in this thread...reading all those non-arguments for one side, downvoting reasonable or even great comments, etc. -_- 
I've been thinking that consensus, agreeing with each other, it is probably the most important of all. 
Have you ever found that you've had a heated discussion with someone, then had the time and patience to actually talk it through properly and realized that you actually agree on most points and that the few outliers you don't agree about are because of completely other fundamental things that require months (or even years) of talking to sort out? 
Well, my theory is that everybody will agree on pretty much everything given infinite time and a little good will (and no interruptive spam). So, if that is a given...then why not start from the assumption that x solution to any and every problem simultaneously is out there, and if everyone doesn't agree, then it can't be x? If you don't balance the equation, if you don't get the answer, then it is no good. You have to make it equal on both sides, on every side. That is when we take collective action. When there is no minority left to suppress because everyone agrees. That is how to avoid the tyranny of the majority, which is current democracy's greatest flaw.
Technology is neutral, it is up to us to decide whether we use it for something positive or something negative. Striving for consensus, should help guide us towards the positive by carefully making sure it is non-negative. I have not yet heard of a better way to achieve this than the current review process.

No, and I've never been there. But I have talked with many people who have, as well as reading and researching a bit. 
So here comes my completely unqualified but not completely uninformed opinion on the matter. 
Macri wants to end capital controls. I'm saying sure, but he might not be able to, at least not right away (a possibility). 
The problem is that he will have to deal with several issues to make that happen.
One issue, often overlooked in politics in general, is the entrenched ideas of the bureaucracy. Argentina has been under Peronist rule for the vast majority of the past 70 years. Peronism is based on different interest groups coming together and divvying up the spoils. So, one can assume that the bureaucracy is entrenched and if they are hostile to reform (like in many other places) it will present a formidable obstacle.
But I think the results of the vote makes it very clear that the Argentinian people are fed up with capital controls. So let's assume that the bureaucrats were so fed up that they voted Macri too. 
Here comes the next problem. Argentina refused a debt payment on some national debt that had been partially bought by some vulture fund that was blocking debt renegotiation. A solution to this can be found, and once it is, then Argentina can again get access to New York capital markets.
Furthermore, the Argentinian Peso has two exchange rates. The official exchange rate and the blue dollar rate (black market rate). Officially, you can get about 9 pesos per USD. But if you go to the black market, you will (last time i checked) get 16 pesos per usd! So if he quits the capital controls over night and lets the peso float freely the government would also lose lucerative income from the companies that are currently forced to pay the official rate (which then means cuts in government budgets). 
But in the end is a confidence game. If he manages to present a plan that analysts deem credible and that makes them forecast gdp growth for Argentina, then the Peso will strengthen from removing the capital controls. If, on the other hand, people don't belive it will work, then the peso will be in an even worse free fall than it already has been as people now can move money freely out of the peso from their bank accounts. 
These are some of the difficulties he will have to deal with. In the end, it is basically a confidence game. 
I believe that it could be that lifting capital controls becomes delayed, or maybe a gradual process that takes place over time. Otherwise, if the capital controls are lifted in a poorly executed way, without a comprehensive credible plan, then that might lead to even increased amounts of inflation and total implosion of the peso. In that case, you wouldn't have "capital controls", but you would still have great economical incentives to use bitcoin. 
Personally, I hope Macri has what it takes to reverse the peronist mess without creating and even bigger one. 
One interesting aspect I came over in this article (that I read with Google translate): 
He says something about shares. That keeping a currency gives you a share in the national economy of that currency. And that he believed that it would be much better for Argentinians to have a share in their own economy instead of the US one. That being said, bitcoin is country neutral and a growth sector in the economy...so his remarks are in line with bitcoin and he would have no reason to fight it even though he is unable to change the current system in a meaningful way. 
Anyway, after writing this I came across a fresh off the press article in FT about similar issues to what I've written here:

I believe that it's not sane to undermine the peer review process. In fact it could be a slippery slope into insanity. And if we're evaluating risks like that, why is bip148 more risky?

This. 
Many Americans have a myopic view of currency fluctuations because at the moment the USD is the world reserve currency and they don't see prices in other countries. It is presented as if the Chinese devalued against the dollar, but compared the euro has lost far more compared to the dollar. And there are so many countries whose currency has lost even more towards the dollar, like Brazil for example. 
Of course one could use a service like coinapult's USD value freeze but another option to mitigate the volatility factor is that when you recieve Bitcoin you pay parts of your recurring bills immediately. If you have low variable expenses, then most of the rest are long-term savings anyway.
Edit: for some types of expenses it is also possible to delay buying until the price is better.

I agree that cars have become a plague. Walking, bicycling, public transport and even small scooters/motorbikes are far more efficient alternatives. 
I find cars ugly, loud and dangerous. It is really sad when people decide it is a good idea to bring a ton of steel just to do their grocery shopping. Or even worse, driving to the gym!
Jacob Lund Fisker made a calculation in his book Early Retirement Extreme that shows that for any journey that will take 1 hour to walk or less, it is actually cheaper to walk than to drive. He took into account a decent hourly wage, cost of gasoline, cost of car ownership, time spent getting into and out of the car, etc. 
I'm sure one could optimize some of the numbers to make using a car cheaper, but then compare it to bicycling and you will still be better off for many journeys. In my country, in the time before it was common to own a private car it was also not common to own your own home. People would normally move to a location that is close to their job to minimize the time spent commuting. In that time, people didn't fill their houses with useless junk either, so moving wasn't so painful.
Another interesting aspect is the death of the people transport on trains in the US. Tracks had been built without subsidies from the government and were profitable in their own right. But then government stepped in with a temporary war (WW2) tax on the train companies that became permanent. The government subsidized highways and airports everywhere. And finally, the unions also played their part in strangling rail transport.
If the government would stop subsidizing road and airplane infrastructure, then drivers would at least have to pay the cost of the infrastructure they are using. Furthermore, they should pay for the cost of polluting the air and for the noise pollution. In addition, what is the cost of traffic accidents and road policing?
In fact, one can calculate the Energy returned on energy invested of getting the oil to the car and realize that drivers should be paying for the pollution of extracting the oil, refining it and distributing it as well. Then one can have a look at the energy efficiency of the combustion engine, the oversized engines, the ton of steel people bring around with them, congestion and the wasteful drives people make. Private car ownership is a monumental waste of enormous proportions.

The way I see it, the "Chinese devaluation" is an effort from China to balance out the strong dollar vs the weaker other currencies in the world like the Euro.

I believe this is bullshit. Volume is high in China because of ZERO fee trading. And financial institutions are banned from getting involved to avoid that Bitcoin's risk/volatility will spread into the existing financial system (the reasoning by the government of China).

Sure, the post linking to that BS article by Mike Hearn putting all sorts of unsubstantiated claims and FUD out there. Wake me when something relevant to Bitcoin gets banned. 
Making it very hard to make a hard fork is what allows people to trust that Bitcoin's main selling points, like the maximum of 21 million won't be changed. Any proposed hard-forks have to be a part of a difficult, technical and open review process, otherwise people would not trust Bitcoin. 
Has it ever entered anybody's mind that Theymos might right in his arguments against XT? That proposing a hard fork that many people dislike from the beginning, and then try to force it through with campaigning is something that endangers trust in Bitcoin and hence its whole value proposition.

There is a good chance you are right. I buy every month and hodl. 
I don't use the Coinbase feature, but the main point is still valid. I'm pretty sure there are quite a lot of people following the same strategy with whatever portion of their income they prefer as the potential upside is so high it does make a lot of sense - even if you believe it is much less than 50% likely to go to the moon you are still looking at a 400x-4000x upside. If the price goes lower, we will suck up more supply, eventually making the price go higher again. The rational choice is to put (at least) a (small, if not big,) portion of one's savings in Bitcoin, period. This is why Bitcoin's fate is self-fulfilling - the smart money always wins.
The reason I buy Bitcoin regularly, however, doesn't have much to do with moon-scenarios or profit maximization. To me it is like some kind of weird fetish pleasure to sell fiat and gain honest money. I'm slowly, almost imperceptibly making a run on the government and the central banks, taking away money and value from the military industrial complex, and doing my small bit to stop the madness and make the world a better place. Even if it doesn't turn out that way, it is a damn nice fantasy.

The word compromise implies that there is a debate. But the technical debate has been settled long ago. Accepting an irrational way forward against better judgement isn't progress or compromise, it is setting a dangerous precedent of undermining the peer review consensus model that has served Bitcoin so well. That is undermining Bitcoin's arguably greatest asset and hence undermining its long term value for possible short term gain.

I think the article is arguing that inflation will decrease in Argentina (ie "bad news" for inflation which will become less) - very confusing way to put it. I guess the truth is that for bitcoin, in a way, everything is good, though I guess the net is what counts.
The President is pro-bitcoin, but he also tries to stop the blue dollar and help Argentinians. 
We have a pro-bitcoin president of one of the biggest countries in South America. Great. If he manages to curb the blue dollar, Argentinians win. Great. If he doesn't manage, we still have the blue dollar incentive to use bitcoin in Argentina *and* a pro-bitcoin president of one of the largest countries in South America. Great.
Regardless, even if Argentinians get a stable exchange rate with the dollar (unlike the euro), they will still not be a stranger to the argument of money with a limited supply.

First of all, just giving money to *any* charity is stupid. Many charities exist for the benefit of its employees and to keep the organisation going, not helping people. Source:  
The UN once estimated that of aid to sub-Saharan Africa, only 7% reached those who needed it. Where did the remaining 93% go? Maybe to people making everything worse. 
You need to specify which charity, instead of just saying "give to charity". 
Secondly, a charity holding 10 million Bitcoins...WTF? People are talking about all the remaining Bitcoin holders getting richer if one person burns some BTC. If more than 7% of the remaining Bitcoin holders are providing a net benefit to the world, then that might be better than giving it to charity. 
Finally, giving to charity, if it is a good one, will make you feel good about snoozing. Giving it to the unidentified masses of Bitcoin holders wouldn't give people the same feel-good experience, and hence people might actually just wake up instead.
@_date: 2017-05-23 22:30:52
It's not about it being directly detrimental. But first of all, hard forks should be avoided unless you really have to use them. And if the total block weight is going to be 4 anyway, then the only major difference is that you change the economics of segwit transactions so that multisig transactions get less of a discount compared to regular ones.
First of all, have we tested this configuration?
Second of all, if we are going to do a hard fork, we should be doing lots of other things than a simple blocksize change. There is a long hard fork wish list you know.
Thirdly, there already is technical consensus that we should move forward with 1mb blocks as is and a segwit soft fork for various reasons. This has been technical consensus for a year and a half or so. The debate about this ended then. Since then, there has been various trolling attempts, but no real serious technical arguments have been raised.
Anyway, the main thing is that we don't want to undermine the fantastic peer review process we have in Bitcoin. It is really par excellence.

So you don't think people will want all kinds of different things after the collapse of the financial institutions? 
Do you really think people will stop needing all those different bits of anything (Overstock pretty much sells everything, even fresh produce)? 
Don't you think there will be a million ways for them to pivot their business operation just from the fact that they will be one of the only companies who can continue operating and paying wages? 
Is "considering getting *some* Overstock shares" really such a madcap idea in and of itself because it is one of the few companies that actually has a good chance of surviving long term? 
Germans who held shares of Siemens, for example, were and still are completely fine even though they lost two world wars and had one of the most rampant hyper inflation periods the world has ever seen.

If you are unsure, then split your money in half, buy for half now, and if price goes beyond a certain threshold you set and it still doesn't seem like relenting, then buy more. If it doesn't and crashes back down to around $200 then you can average down and still be set for the next gargantuan bull run.
edit: Personally, I'm convinced that anything less than $10000 is a good buy opportunity for the next 2-5 year time frame and that's why I buy as much as I can afford every month to make the price relatively average and because I can't help myself.

It's not like the mining subsidy is wasted, it incentivizes a secure network. And mining profits depend on the difficulty, so the more miners, the higher the difficulty and each miner gets less. If mining is crazy profitable, then more money will be invested in mining and it will become less profitable. We don't need to mess with the incentive structure of Bitcoin around here. Users are supposed to pay for transactions with fees anyway as mining rewards will dry up.

The American Red Cross gets 81/100 on Charity Navigator: 
Despite two terrible and relatively recent reports:
 
From observations in other people, and also from my own experience with how I feel, it seems to me that what often happens is that the desire to give and help others is stronger than the will to do proper research. 
Looking back on some organisations I have given money to, I'm not so sure I did the right thing, possibly I made things worse on the net effect. For example, I have given money Wikipedia. However, I have recently come to doubt if even that is a good idea:
Here is a quick list of some criticisms: 
Here is a longer story about Linda Mack = SlimVirgin, that illustrates the kind of madness that goes on at Wikipedia:  
It looks like Wikipedia is dying a slow death because the editors of Wikipedia are an exclusive and dwindling club due to editorial wars shunning experienced editors and making the barrier high for new ones: 
There is probably a lot more both praise and criticism of Wikipedia out there, but  maybe I'm just wearing a tin-foil hat. I used to think that Wikipedia was a straight up good place to donate, but I'm no longer fully convinced of that. I have gone from Wikipedia-supporter to Wikipedia-neutral. Looking into criticisms about Wikipedia will make your head explode, as everything circles over these minute details leading ever further until you just give up.
Yes Wikipedia has still been pretty useful for me even though it might be highly deficient on many topics (how would I ever have time to research that on every single topic?). So the question is if they really are a net-benefit, or if they are just a website with a collection of simple facts that you can get from other websites, and the rest is descending into a politically charged shitstorm so severe that almost no-one wants to contribute anymore.
And that is the case with so many charities out there, exactly *how* am I supposed to **really know**?
My point is that when I set out to help other people, **I better be damn sure I'm not in reality being used as a tool to serve some other purpose or inflict net harm** - because I know that is the bias that has been exploited in so many people who *want to help* others (**socialism is a good example**, the movie *The Soviet Story* shows how *helping* the workers can *easily turn into eugenics* in one form or another because what you are fundamentally trying to do is to change other people into becoming something else). 
Mostly I think like this to minimize the risk of inflicting harm instead of helping: 
=I give money to people whom I know personally and can ask questions about what they are going to do with the money - they could still be trying to trick me, but I believe that a majority of humans will not lie to someone they know personally when being interrogated thoroughly *and* have answers to probing questions without being bothered or *seem like they are lying*.
=I just give money directly to people whom I believe could use it.
=That I myself just help people I meet by doing something that helps them.
=That I look out for my own self interest, but also try to not harm others but be helpful, so that if it is harmful by mistake, at least *someone* is benefiting.
Otherwise, I believe the EFF might be a good charity - but maybe I'm naïve. eDRI looks like they are supposed to be fighting for good causes (and giving voice to arguments that are seldom herd in Brussels and sorely needed, but I can't find much information about them). I'm open to suggestions of other charities that have a relatively high likelihood of not being corrupt.

If people wanted to avoid capital controls, they would buy BTC for CNY on a Chinese exchange and then sell it for USD or EUR on an American or European exchange. Hardly, anything that would correspond with such a prise rise because people would not end up holding BTC. 
The Euro has devalued several times the amount the CNY has over the past 2 years if you compare it to the dollar...so I think the Chinese "devaluation" is trying to balance the exchange rate somewhere between the EUR and the USD, the currencies of China's two largest trading partners (about *equal* in size of trade), the US and the EU.
The one thing I would say we know for sure, is that the capital flight aspect we are seeing with Bitcoin is a slow and steady flight out of all kinds of all kinds of fiat to avoid any (capital) control by any country and **into** Bitcoin - but that is an overall 6 year trend.
Hopefully some of the Chinese investors will really understand Bitcoin and become long-term hodlers.

Start talking with the dispensaries you are supplying and how it might be really beneficial if they start accepting bitcoin and paying you directly with those Bitcoin. You'll be completely free to do as you wish, without fear of the federal government. 
If you need help in the specifics about setting everything up, I'm sure people here, like would be willing to help you figure out the details and if you succeed in getting a dispensary to accept Bitcoin and paying you directly with those Bitcoin, then you will be responsible for one of the first close-loop businesses. 
That will be huge news and the dispensary would surely get a lot of free marketing from this reddit and any Bitcoin news source, meaning they, and you would get a lot of extra business from excited Bitcoiners wanting to pay with Bitcoin without worrying that the Bitcoin is immediately sold for fiat and hence reducing the price.

No, No, NO. This is newspeak. The words DO matter. 
"All of them, in some way, are using the blockchain, some of them are still using bitcoin,"...is he indicating that blockchain will be used but that bitcoin won't in the future?
If investors run away at hearing the word bitcoin, then good riddance. We don't need investors who have no clue and who get scared once something gets too disruptive for them.

This is move shows how desperate the country is. Capital outflow will start increasing, starting in developing countries. Looks like we are seeing a rehash of the Asian Financial crisis:  
That means US dollars will still be in high demand for the time being as outflows to Bitcoin and gold (the only real alternatives) are still negligible compared to the billions and trillions of dollars worth that flow between countries.
edit: As for the foreign workers being blamed for the government's failure, they will be able to use Bitcoin right now to solve their problems. Assuming they find someone who is willing to sell BTC and buy Ringgit...but that might be difficult now that the cat is out of the bag and the government is panicking.

Great post. I don't welcome MIT/NSA involvement in Bitcoin. The whole XT-debacle should be a warning sign. Remember how Satoshi Nakamoto disappeared after Gavin Andresen said he was visiting the CIA? And how Gavin Andresen started working for MIT and spearheaded a divisive hard fork?

Users running full nodes have no incentive at all, and they would be punished if blocks become large.


Not if we keep focusing on consensus.


Campaigning for breaking the consensus is censored here, not arguing possible downsides of keeping the blocksize limit at 1mb. 


Currently blocks aren't even full and people report still being able to send zero-fee transactions.

Because, among other things, to quote Hampus Sjöberg from a recent post on the Bitcoin mailing list: "Just doing a simple 2MB without fixing anything else is very uninteresting, and a hardfork without addressing replay protection seems really unprofessional to me."
But more importantly, agreeing to this is undermining Bitcoin's peer review process. That is a serious long term risk.

Hahaha. Thanks for making me laugh! 
Look. What's totally unfair is that all these scammers are allowed to go around spreading false claims and tricking 16-year-olds to part with their money. Actually, the SEC will probably come down on a lot of these shitcoin (in fact you even using the term altcoins somehow implies that they are on equal footing with Bitcoin) and ICO scams.
I'm not denying that there could be one or two other projects outside of Bitcoin that could have merit. But if there are, you can't identify them by looking at market cap. In the meantime, Ethereum, Dash, Ripple, etc. is just hot air. It's hard to be anything but dismissive about these projects...and any reasoned technical criticism usually just gets waved away as details and not real problems.
The real metric to see the value in Bitcoin is that it is actually being used (and I'm talking about real use, not speculators moving money. I'm not talking about speculators buying something online that they could also have used a cc for), it's hard to believe that there is much real use of any of the other "coins".
So in fact, the most fair an balanced views is that alts are shit (with extremely few possible exceptions that cannot be seen from looking at market cap).

If they are a lot dumber than you and have a track record of being insanely unsuccessful, maybe they are not talking bullshit, also – that depends on *what* they are saying.
My point is that you have to listen to *what* people say, not *who* they are. 
Even the person I respect the most, I will not take seriously, when they speak bullshit. If you are happy to doubt your own judgement because someone "smart and successful" says something that doesn't make sense then go ahead. I prefer to doubt my own judgement only if there is an actual argument calling it into question.

Indeed it looks like this is the case in some jurisdictions. 
Also there is the case that with smaller amounts of currency should not be treated as an investment anyway. 
Furthermore, there is another interesting case: if I'm living in Europe and have some USD lying around for which I buy a Cigar at a time when the USD exchange rate has changed so that my purchasing power has increased measured in Euros, then I can hardly believe I would be liable for captial gains tax. The same should apply with Bitcoin.

I haven't said that it is a bad thing. I don't know whether zero fees is good or bad. And frankly, I don't care.

I have all of those things already. I'm looking to diversify further. 
Companies that have survived through periods of great strife are excellently positioned for whenever they comes out on the other side. 
Another thing I like about Overstock is their focus on simple and sober business practices. Unlike many other businesses, I don't find myself thinking "I could have done that a lot better". 
Besides, holding gold is a dead asset, not generating anything, it just sits there. Holding shares of a business is a share of economic activity that keeps on going - however most businesses are not likely to survive the collapse, most businesses use business practices that have to formulated by drunk madmen and holding shares of businesses in the regular way, through brokers, means I would risk losing a significant chunk of my holdings if the shares have secretly been lent out to other people.
Most of my savings are in BTC, but not all.

The one thing that Mr. Allaire fails to mention is that his customers don't get the benefit of the trustless nature of the Bitcoin blockchain, only Circle does. 
If Circle were a company with the right motives, they would go in the direction of user control of funds, open source and layers on top of Bitcoin. With their banking connections they should easily be able to set up some kind of marketplace to make bitcoin interface better with USD.

The way I see it, the "Chinese devaluation" is an effort from China to balance out the strong dollar vs the weaker other currencies in the world like the Euro.

Andreas Antonopoulos clearly has the means to get a lot done, because what he is doing and saying makes sense.
As for ms Masters, you think she has the means to get *what* done exactly? She currently seems to have the means to draw the banks' attention away from where the action *really* is. Which is actually something good for us. At the moment, I see her as some kind of pathetic, narrow-minded careerist that has no clue about what she's doing. 
If, on the other hand, she starts talking about how Bitcoin allows people to side-step banking altogether and put power back into the hands of the individual because of the Nakamoto consensus rules. Then I will take her seriously. If she starts talking about how the banks need to start mining Bitcoin because it is basically impossible to regulate otherwise...then I will start to get nervous. 
Her connections, background etc. don't matter for squat when she clearly has no idea what she is doing. And someone with that kind of background that is supposedly so stellar having no idea what they are doing - that is very hard to take seriously.

What I'm saying is that the zero fees means a lot of people (or bots) are buying and selling to themselves at the same price. I don't know if this is a good or a bad thing, but I do know that you cannot compare volume on exchanges with fees to volume on exchanges without fees - hence saying that 80% of the trading volume today is happening in China is meaningless.

I had to chop off at some point because that post was fairly long and convoluted and I didn't want to get into its entirety here. But I did link to the source. 


I believe this is a false premise. More transactions can be jammed in per byte as we get future improvements (like Schnorr signatures). Furthermore, improvements in bandwidth and storage space, will make room for larger blocks...eventually. Finally, a regular person would probably only need to make a handful of transactions on chain in a lifetime. But when those transactions are made, it is important to be able to verify that they are real.
But  even accepting your false premise I can answer you directly based on that: People who want to confirm that they indeed did receive a transaction would want to run their own node.
Now let's get back to what we were actually discussing:




Whoa! Hold your horses. BU was a HF. Then after this you go on answering something that totally was not my question. To repeat, my question was "why do we need replay protection in this case?"

Perhaps I was too absolute. 
But what I'm trying to understand is how BIP148 could not be activated when the incentives and previous situations point towards that it will. 
I mean, how do you see the situation of some exchanges not accepting bip148 coming about? Through ignorance or "cheering for their team"? 
Or do you see rational explanations of such a behavior?
@_date: 2017-06-11 13:08:19
Here is the official list of wallets, and as you can see blockchain.info is not on there among the web wallets. And none of the web wallets that are on there gives you "control over your money". To me Electrum seems to be the best compromise between security and usability for noobs. But in time you should consider running a fully validating node:

Bullshit. You said:


Source: 


I have shown nothing of the sort. A replay attack is where you spend money on one chain after a split, and your transaction gets broadcast to the other chain as well. To protect against this you need to split the coins by making sure that they are on one address on one chain and on another on the other and that you have sufficient confirmations of that. 
Now, please answer my question of why we would need replay protection.

@_date: 2017-06-04 10:12:16
Exchanges couldn't risk being wiped out, they have to accept bip148. Miners can't risk it either. Almost everyone is pro-segwit now, so there is no reason to go the risky route on the legacy chain just to be wiped out.

The problem seems to be that it's impossible to remove all risk of chain split if a major miner doesn't want an upgrade. They can just start mining their own chain. It might be unsafe just to let the status quo continue.

This becomes a problem only if miners split the chain. 
Many wallets already support bip148 and users should be safe in case miners decide to split the chain: Airbitz, Coinkite, Coinomi, Electrum, GreenAddress, Ledger Wallet, Mycelium, Samourai Wallet, Trezor. 
Storing Bitcoin with third parties has always been risky and if exchanges accept Legacycoins in the event that miners decide to split the chain, they're in big doodoo.
