Every organization or cause has overzealous supporters they're called cheerleaders, bitcoin is no different.

What did the Doge say to the Bitcoin?
Doge: Such joke, so wow.

On the official bitcoin forums there is a sub-board titled economics. This is what they were refering to.
@_date: 2011-08-07 06:44:24
Seriously your first clue should have been that someone was trying to sell you a bt downloader. No decent client costs anything.
@_date: 2011-08-05 17:04:17
So basically what they're saying is since some hacker website was registered on the same domain registar that it automatically must be them? 
The owner of mybitcoin could have easily foreseen this correlation and laid a bait and switch for an easy scapegoat. I find their spacious reasoning disturbing.

Yep mtred are down for me.
If it was a ddos its definitely not cool.
@_date: 2011-05-21 06:06:48
Can you tell us why you chose to do it this way?
@_date: 2011-06-11 15:38:13
Yeah, I really don't know what good taking the forum down would do in that process, there are other places to communicate, like reddit.

It's nice for starters who can't setup there own miner, but it's also mutitudes slower than setting up your own miner.

Hey again, found the link to what I was looking for. You may not neccessarly  have your account frozen but you may want to[ read this]( Be careful friends, the rest of the thread is primarily about people being probed by paypal regarding bitcoin related activities.
@_date: 2011-07-06 19:06:32
I think someone contacted them and cleared it up, i can no longer find any results for Bitcoin or bitcoin.
EDIT:Ignore me I'm an idiot.
@_date: 2011-06-11 14:18:53
I think it means a previous order you made has yet to be put through.
@_date: 2011-05-21 06:03:45
I thought paypal was actively freezing the accounts of bitcoin traders, has something changed?
@_date: 2011-08-07 07:46:33
Personally I don't think that the wireless trade off is that great, I can get several MB/s outta my wireless connection which is more than sufficient. Unless you're downloading ridiculous amounts of bt's it should be enough for you too. That being said if doing something for free works, why change it?
Honestly your bitcoins are better spent on something else. I know you were just trying to help out the economy, but right now(and for the past few months) the economy isn't stable enough to justify buying anything.
@_date: 2011-08-07 06:17:02
Just use utorrent with rss feeds.
@_date: 2011-06-11 23:27:43
Yes they are popular, but they didn't have the volume of bitcoins to pull it off.
Lulzsec donation address history:
The 400ish they have is nowhere near enough to cause a slide like this.
@_date: 2011-06-11 14:21:38
They've done this a lot over the past few weeks, they're just sorting out details.
@_date: 2011-05-17 08:26:19
Yeah it's kinda low because I'm just testing this all out on my laptop. When my pc is back in working order things will be different.
@_date: 2011-05-19 02:55:51
Looks cool, but it feels like its missing something.

I only got 0.02 BTC from the faucet....
@_date: 2011-06-12 00:39:39
That'd be great except for the daily limits exchanges pose on withdrawls, they simply cannot move that volume. Not to mention that the money has to end up in someones bank account eventually, which would raise tax flags that lulzsec really doesn't want to be waving.
It was more likely this guy 
@_date: 2011-05-18 02:01:14


Unless you run a crappy computer, in which case pooling is far more efficient.
@_date: 2011-07-06 19:31:32
My bad misspelled it.
@_date: 2011-05-17 09:06:18
That's what I was implying, once my pc is working again(broken) I will have a gpu to use instead of this shitty emachines laptop.
Also I already did a bit of research on this, I was asking here to get info from a real human being rather than a wiki.
@_date: 2011-08-07 04:38:27
You ordered a bit torrent downloader? &amp;
@_date: 2011-10-18 15:38:23
Does your company block peer to peer traffic?
@_date: 2011-06-12 00:01:30
That may be true, but where did the coins come from? Let's assume they bought them back around may when they were just gaining publicity and the price was around $5. The volume they'd need to buy to cause this slide would be in excess of tens of thousands.
Ask yourself, if you were a lulzsec member would you contribute that much money so your friends could pull a prank? I wouldn't, but then again I don't have money to burn.

I honestly couldn't tell you if that was possible or not, maybe the folks in this thread can help you: 
Note: the topics on the bitcoin forums are as of recently turning to dipshitery so please be advised.
@_date: 2011-05-20 21:02:31
Try pooling, its far more effective than soloing at your computing power.
Your hitting around 18 mhash/s combined, which isn't horrible if your pooling. But if you want to solo you're going to need GPU's pulling around 1 ghash/s or more. [This guy]( is pulling around 6.5 ghash/s off of four computers.
@_date: 2011-08-07 07:09:12
In that case it's worse than I thought, if you're buying a machine to dowload bt's then you're really trying too hard....or not hard enough I can't decide.
@_date: 2011-06-11 14:53:36
I know someone was speculating that they colluded to take the forum down while at the same time they dumped coins. 
However I seriously doubt that's the case, it's more likely that the increased volume of traffic to the forum as the price fell caused it to go down temporarily.
@_date: 2011-08-06 04:53:00
M Night would be proud.

At first I thought you were a novelty account someone created five minutes ago, then i checked your sign up date, that's dedication.
@_date: 2011-08-03 20:36:10
That being said it makes me fear something much worse, the owner didn't keep up with his hosting payments and the provider shut him down and deleted his content including the wallets he had. If that's the case then $1 m worth of bitcoins got flushed down the can by some unwitting sysadmin just doing his job.
@_date: 2011-05-18 04:29:01
Please help me out here....
Wouldn't pooling render more consistent pay outs as there are many people splitting the work load and the rewards? Yes your payout is much lower than that of a person with a solo mega rig, but isn't something still better than nothing if you're running a crappy rig?(disregarding power costs of course)

Interesting, I've never thought of the implications of knocking out a competing pool. 
@_date: 2011-06-12 01:05:56
I'm not convinced they had the forsight to do so, just seems too coincidental.
@_date: 2011-06-11 23:16:34
In order to pull this off they'd need copious amounts of bitcoins. I think lulzsec is trolling for the lulz as the case may be.
Edit: It's more likely this guy 
@_date: 2011-05-30 17:05:14
....and deepbit is definitely one of the biggest pools hash power wise. But unless they have the machines to pick up the slack would it make any difference?
@_date: 2017-05-15 21:55:25
Until Rick Sanchez has his way with it.

Despite proving a point about security, why attack bitcoin pools?
@_date: 2011-08-05 19:02:14
PHP isn't that bad if you know what you're doing, since we don't know anything about the guy running mybitcoin we could easily assume he doesn't know what hes doing at all.
