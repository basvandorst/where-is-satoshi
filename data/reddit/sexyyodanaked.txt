I can see it being a store of value but nothing else, which is fine. A gold standard that isn’t practical but a steadfast OG of crypto/blockchain projects. Realistically I think that will happen alongside ETH. Doesn’t HAVE to be “all or nothing” by any means.

Paying $5 in transaction fees for a $10 game? No thanks- not surprised unfortunately.

I made a transaction today with Bitcoin Cash. It was nice because I actually DIDN’T have to pay $25 to move the money. 
I can see BTC core becoming a store of value, but that’s it. I’m afraid that the lack of usability will ultimately turn people off though.
I know I’ll get downvotes for this, but I can’t tell you how FUCKING easy and fast it was to use BCH. I didn’t want to, but I find myself being forced to now because of BTC insane lag and absurdly high tx fees.

Exactly this- I am extremely worried that once people realize it is unusable, the price will fall hard and take entire crypto market with it. Ughh please find a fricking solution to this!!

I think having a gun in place is at least more of a deterrent than not having one though

If I ever become a whale, I’m going to do this for real just to blow everyobes minds

That’s insane to think we came off using gold for trade less than 100 years ago....all these people denying that crypto is the next phase are completely in denial.

Naw going to $1,000 apparently according to r/cryptocurrency

Coinbase has many Americans locked in because they made it super super easy to buy it on users iPhones and crap- someone needs to figure out how to do this without being corrupt smh
