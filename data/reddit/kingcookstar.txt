“Bitcoin is the internet of money. Currency is only the first application. If you grasp that, you can look beyond the price, you can look beyond the volatility, you can look beyond the fad. At its core, bitcoin is a revolutionary technology that will change the world forever.” - Andreas M. Antonopoulos

@_date: 2018-01-17 09:42:52
are you ok mate? I’m worried about you
I’m sitting on the toilet at work and had a look through your previous comments it’s all very negative, you should find a subreddit you enjoy and can be positive in, rather then constantly commenting in a subreddit you seem to hate
Do you have hobbies or anything you enjoy doing? There’s probably a subreddit for it

He’s advising people to keep there bitcoins on a exchange now I’m done 
Edit: anyone new to crypto please purchase a hardware wallet to store large amounts of bitcoins on
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:05:54
to name a few, the easiest way would be to send bitcoin to the exchanges and swap it for Ripple, be careful though do some research before you start swapping BTC for alts

@_date: 2017-12-21 16:29:46
Please don’t swear, right so what’s wrong with buying bitcoin with it? 
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:53:58
So you are not going to answer the question still because I’m right and you have no reply so just swear and be rude instead nice debate 
@_date: 2017-12-21 08:46:57
There’s no point arguing with this gem guy he sounds like the manager of a bank who doesn’t understand blockchain  
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:44:30
Again please don’t swear, you haven’t answered my question in my previous comment

I’m not your mommy on reddit. I was at work and didn’t  have time to search the sub or google to link you a post 
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:16:41
What about localbitcoins 
@_date: 2017-12-21 10:58:58
No, 
coinbase &gt; GDAX = free
GDAX &gt; any wallet = free 
You can avoid fees by doing this if you search google/this sub there’s posts about it 
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:19:51
Because if the exchange gets hacked you will lose all of the bitcoins...is this a serious question?
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:55:56
It’s nice to see only 19% of people have been tricked isn’t it!
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:50:47
You haven’t answered it the first place bro, relax you sound so angry and aggressive 
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:18:36

Point taken, like I said to the other guy who said the same thing, I have now removed that sentence, I was just trying to explain the future has never been brighter 
@_date: 2018-02-05 08:54:58
Nice, good luck!
@_date: 2018-02-05 08:58:41
True, maybe I’ll edit that bit out, I was really trying to say the future has never looked so bright apart from the price 
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:27:47
No it hasn’t.
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:02:01
I’m not referring to the price, the technology itself has never looked in better shape
