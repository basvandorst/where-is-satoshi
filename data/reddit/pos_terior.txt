Proof must be multi-faceted. The person in question must:
* Sign a message with the private key that holds the genesis block 50BTC
* Prove ownership of the [Bitcoin network alert key](
* Sit down with someone fully versed in the early Bitcoin code(Gavin Andresen, etc) and demonstrate full knowledge and understanding of the code.
Do this an we **may** not consider you an imposter.

The meaning of "sidechain" is relative. To Liquid, Bitcoin is a sidechain. 
Liquid could, one day, become a primary cryptocurrency, supported by merchants, used by their customers, and controlled by a consortium of exchanges and payment processors. The network could easily be co-opted by the banksters. 
While Liquid sounds very promising, lets not kid ourselves. It is a tool to be used by a closed club. It is not an open decentralized system.

Yep.  They're "protecting" us from MITM(Man in the middle) attacks. Well, they are the MITM if they don't give us the possibility to even see the bitcoin address and force us to use protocols outside of Bitcoin. 
In the age of crypto where one party can sign a message to help the receiver to authenticate the message, why the hell do we need this sort of crap? They could publish their public key in the blockchain. A payment url would contain the amount, bitcoin address, and a signature and our Bitcoin clients could use it to verify the content of a payment URL.

You can't make $12/day mining Bitcoin with a GPU. GPUs mining capabilities are rated in millions of hashes per second. Current technologies(ASIC miners) are rated in the trillions of hashes per second. You'd be competing with that. And add to that the fact that the efficiency of a GPU is equally poor as its hash rate. You'd pay more for electricity than you would make in bitcoin earnings.

But wow, the paper is dense.    
The gist is: 
"In this paper, we present a probabilistic gossip-based Byzantine reliable broadcast algorithm ...  Essentially, we propose samples as a replacement for quorums. Like a probabilistic quorum, a sample is a randomly selected set of processes. Unlike quorums, samples do not need to intersect. Samples can be significantly smaller than quorums, as each sample must be large enough only to be representative of the system with high probability. 
A process can use its sample to gather information about the global state of the system. An old Italian saying provides an intuitive understanding of this shift of paradigm: “To know if the sea is salty, one needs not drink all of it!” Intuitively, we leverage the law of large numbers, trading performance for a fixed, arbitrarily small probability of non-representativeness."

No suitable answers here. One cannot expect end users to run a specific operating system, learn scripting, or develop anything.  There are other problems with recurring payments as described below.
"Automated recurring payments are not possible with decentralized Bitcoin wallets. Even if a wallet supported automatically sending non-reversible payments on a regular schedule, the user would still need to start the program at the appointed time, or leave it running all the time unprotected by encryption.
This means automated recurring Bitcoin payments can only be made from a centralized server which handles satoshis on behalf of its spenders. In practice, receivers who want to set prices in fiat terms must also let the same centralized server choose the appropriate exchange rate.
Non-automated rebilling can be managed by the same mechanism used before credit-card recurring payments became common: contact the spender and ask them to pay again—for example, by sending them a PaymentRequest bitcoin: URI in an HTML email.
In the future, extensions to the payment protocol and new wallet features may allow some wallet programs to manage a list of recurring transactions. The spender will still need to start the program on a regular basis and authorize payment—but it should be easier and more secure for the spender than clicking an emailed invoice, increasing the chance receivers get paid on time."
Another problem with repeatedly sending payments to a single payment address is: how do you know that the address is still valid without checking it from time to time? How do you know that they receiver didn't change wallets due to data loss or a compromised private key?

There should be a system whereby holders of BTC can sign a message with their private key(s) in support of a BIP and these are then tallied and viewable by all.
That is the only way to measure economic support. Of course there is nothing to prevent some exchanges from using other people's funds to sign messages. Then again, if you don't hold it, it ain't yours.

The only reason that credit card companies give so many perks is that they also sell your behavioral information. That is a huge  profit for them.
Just like Google(You think GMail and other Google services are free?), they are selling your behavioral or profile to advertisers.

Bitcoin is a growing ecosystem. We need to put Bitcoin in more people's hands. Especially in the hands of individuals and small businesses. THIS will help Bitcoin adoption and growth. So... give these people a reason to accept and continue accepting Bitcoin: spend it on their products.
Now that we've got a way to help Bitcoin grow organically, we can take a little more money and buy Bitcoin and hodl it. And if all goes well we'll benefit.
This is called a balanced approach. Participate in Bitcoin economic exchanges to keep the crypto-blood flowing in the organism. If the organism's blood stops flowing, it dies(or is replaced by another). This organism WILL give back if you hodl, so do that. But also be a part of the  organism by engaging in exchange.

Knowing that there is a limited number of transactions per unit time  that Bitcoin can handle  - it's effective throughput of ~7tps - is there not a risk of causing a panic where there should be none?
What about this scenario: 
 * People start transferring funds out of exchanges
 * Some exchanges send out all the bitcoin in their hot wallets and need to top them up from their cold wallets.
* These top-up transactions get delayed due to high number of Bitcoin transactions.
* There is rumor of insolvent exchanges
* Some people - who did not initially intend to move funds out -  panic and decide to move their funds out of their exchange, this adding more transactions to the network.
* More exchanges are unable to move funds from their cold wallets.
* More panic, more transactions, more delays
* Mass panic. MSM goes freaking nuts with it. Bad news for Bitcoin.
