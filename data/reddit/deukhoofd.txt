Well, that means you will still be paying taxes. It's that simple.


Unless I'm completely misinterpreting you, you are very much against the government and if it were up to you the government wouldn't exist. However, it's not up to you, it's up to every person in your country of residence.  This would mean you either fall in line with the rest (need of the many outweigh the need of the few) or you move to another place, a place where you can live without a government.

You live in a community, that community has agreed they will all pay taxes to make life better for the community. A few people might disagree, but seeing as how they are living in a democratic community they will have to do what the majority agrees to (Which is a bad thing about a democracy, but well, we haven't thought of a better way.) 
They can of course move out of the community if they really don't want to do it.
Basically, living in a community you fully disagree with and which you apparently refuse to recognise (which is extremely selfish) is extremely useless, and you might as well remove yourself from the community.

He's not measuring your intelligence based on if you agree with him, he's basing it on him explaining why you are taxed to you, after which you said you didn't listen and apparently don't care. You say something is bad, but don't want to listen to the reasons why it is in place. That's just plain moronic.

So you have 2 choices: either you move to somewhere else or you start agreeing to the rules. Seeing as how you are apparently breaking your own moral guidelines living in the US, why are you still living there?

Seriously, why are you still living under a government you so hate? Go ahead, stop paying taxes, stop doing everything the government tells you to. Let's see what happens.

That's true, however this is also achievable with a government. There is of course the possibility of toll roads, or the possibility to moderate the distance driven by cars, and basing your tax on that. 
While you may be nice enough to pay for what you use, I believe that if you'd remove the government some people wouldn't pay for services they use. I believe there needs to be an entity to make these people also pay for it, and if that's the government, so be it. 
I agree with you that a less controlling government is a good thing, but I also think taxes are a necessary evil.

"People built the roads'
You think they did that for free? The government paid them to do that. The yearly maintenance of those roads you're using is 44 billion dollars. New roads cost an additional 20 billion dollars yearly. [Source]( Who is paying for that you think?

If the government were to be removed you'd still need to pay for the roads, so you'd still be paying taxes.

What do you think would happen if you suddenly pull a banks license?  Rabobank has 700 billion worth of assets. Imagine what would happen if a government just forcibly toppled a bank like that, you'd have another financial crisis, but this time instead of the housing market the Food and Agrarian sectors would be hit hardest, as that is where Rabobank specializes in. You'd cause a global crisis, and no government would want to cause that.
