Hey Marshall! What techniques you use to improve cross-(China) border bandwidth and latency?

Arthur, Sam and Ben are an amazing team and have done a great job with BitMEX...look forward to watching them grow!

Sounds like EST. I set that stream to start at 8:50 AM HKT.
Sorry you won't be able to make it! :-(
I put all four session streams in a playlist: 
Better to bookmark our bitcoinhk page or the playlist in case the individual streams need to be changed before broadcast! 
They'll also be linked off of scalingbitcoin.org very soon.

I'll be there. Look forward to it.

Some of us in HK have been looking more closely at some of the questions behind this exchange. We'll be collecting and sharing our findings here:
@_date: 2014-11-08 19:09:05
Very true. The success of companies like Xiaomi show that customers in the $50 and $100 mobile phone market also want and deserve a great user experience. Bitcoin can and will offer that.

Go read about Perfect forward secrecy: not having it is only a feature if your customer is a bunch of black hats or the NSA.

It's a post about Hong Kong: HSBC, Bank of China &amp; Citi are most of the banking market and the two exchanges are 100% of our Bitcoin exchanges! Definitely not scientific though!
@_date: 2014-04-29 20:51:41
Congrats! Super excited for this to come to Hong Kong too!

I'm using "Bitcoin" here to mean "the Bitcoin community." Apologies for any confusion.

Open bar for first 100 ppl, HK$30/drink if u pay with bitcoin. HK$50/drink with fiat

You're right. Sorry about that! I had written most of the post before that news came out. I kept the part about QR codes in because that's what people are currently using. It is also what iOS users will continue to use for mobile payment unless Apple has a change of heart about opening up their NFC api. I do hope BitPay NFC is widely successful. Will be great for the Bitcoin community!

With out Perfect forward security exploiting heartbleed exposes all current, historical and future encrypted traffic. With PFS exploiting heartbleed only exposes current and future traffic. Majority of data at risk is historical - PFS protects that.

Author makes interesting case that what they're up to are micropayments with Bitcoin that could change the way network traffic is routed &amp; paid for. I think author underestimates the complexity of implementing QoS Internet wide, but an interesting read nonetheless. Definitely something big happening.

HAHA ❤️ multipass

You can add it to any site! The Javascript code is a bit hidden, apologies for that!  
@_date: 2015-05-11 13:25:08
Worse than the current system which is asking you random questions about public record information like:  date of birth, ID card number, address, etc?

Gravatar is centralized and using it automatically breaks your site in a number of countries where Gravatar is blocked. Also using something like Gravatar in a product requires a business relationship with Wordpress &amp; leaks proprietary information about your business and customer base to Gravatar.  
You can use Passcard avatars for your wordpress avatar and embed profiles with my project Nametiles...there's a wordpress plugin:

Update: Bitstamp CEO Nejc Kodrič issued a public comment via Twitter

Wow that's a great way to put it! Makes a lot more sense to me when described as removing the commons!
@_date: 2015-05-20 20:58:06
Website is open source. You can also read it on github! 
@_date: 2015-05-12 05:22:37
Few more: 
6. No need to update your profile information at 100s of sites each time it changes
7. no more broken links on sites that mention you
8. freedom from censorship/3rd parties forcing you to use their concept of a name or identity, appropriate profile pic, etc
9. infrastructure businesses can build on without permission or business risk (see what we're doing with Passcard &amp; Pay4Bugs

Everything they do is open source and use is voluntary. There are a number of companies, projects and people involved in the identity portion of the project that aren't working for or affiliated with Onename, such as myself and my Nametiles project ( which builds on top of the Blockchain ID (formerly Passcard) standard that they put forth.  I share your concern about private companies trying to "own" identity which is why Onename's work was so attractive to me.
We all hang out over at Blockstack ( Would love for you to stop by and further explain your concerns so that we can make sure that no one has to fear one company trying to own a critical part of the crypto ecosystem. 
@_date: 2015-08-05 15:18:33
Unlikely - they've been talking about open sourcing their registrar code for a while. Any info about idchains that isn't in 1/2 hour video form? A write up or something?
@_date: 2015-08-05 18:01:18
Cool. I saw. The Slack is for chat - forum is probably better place to get started. Here's a good thread!

I look forward to the movie &amp; hardcover boxed set! Samson has a bright future in Bitcoin fan fiction!

Namecoin already require additional tools to perform lookups at any scale - I've been running a node in production for 1/2 year at  - will also be following the move to Bitcoin/blockstore
@_date: 2015-09-30 08:01:40
Not true. The move from Namecoin to Bitcoin/Blockstore was discussed at length in the community and it wasn't a unilateral Onename marketing decision. 
@_date: 2015-09-12 17:52:11
There is a discussion thread here discussing (&amp; debating) the reasons for the move to Bitcoin from namecoin.

Great work! Thanks for sharing!
