I think you are correct.. maybe this is the way they changed the email address. IF not hacked inside job, have no idea.. Fact of the matter is that email address could not have been changed by itself.
After closing down the chat on the site because of my requests, they finally let someone else answer emails, and well.. they found an excuse instead of admitting they again effed up:
 Thanks for the email. Sorry for the late reply, and we have double checked your previous email. Since full passport copy is provided and you explained the concerns about account security. **In this case,** to protect account information, **the information you provided is enough** to freeze the account.  
So yeah... i\`m done with okex. Poloniex is better, Bitmex if you are a little crazier

Change bank... I have good experiences with ING, the other.. cannot say

And now for the lies... 
You froze my account without my permission on Fri, Dec 14, 2018, 5:55 PM
because i had not activated 2FA. NO annoucement NO warning! 
You then had the audacity to ask me for video verification to activate my account again although i explicitly asked you from my REGISTERED mail to unfreeze my account because i have open positions that need attending. You refused!
When we got on skype you wanted to make me lie about the reason for the unfreeze and i quote "Sir, please say this after me: I have requested the account to be locked  and now i want to unlock it"
After asking you why you wanted me to lie, a voice in the back said.. it's ok without the lie!
"We checked that your account email address hasn't been changed on our platform"
I never said my account was hacked, a friends account, which username i won't be posting in full here, but if you want i can send you an email with it. trk***
Yes he also deserted you after that fiasco!
And you are lying even in this post.. " Please be noted that our due diligence is to ensure a strong &amp; compliant trading platform and to better secure your assets in OKEx"
You have untrained ppl that tell me it will take 24 hours, and then it takes 72, you have ppl telling me that my account will be unfrozen immediately and then it takes 3 days, and more over it takes video verification again?!
Right now i wish i could delete my data from your servers, but you refuse to help me stating policy.. basically you are stealing customers data and citing "internal procedures".. That data is NOT yours, and unless you are willing to give me money to trade on your platform i sure as hell won't be coming back. There is too much risk and honestly you seam shady (and we all know what happened to a shady exchange named MTGOX)
So while i do appreciate you trying to clear your name here, at least you could have told the truth! 
If you want to inspire confidence please answer these questions below with YES OR NO:
1. Did you lock out people out of their accounts (freeze) because they didn't have 2FA enabled without any prior warning?
2. Have you EVER been hacked or had an incident that involved an email address changing without any Email communication whatsoever which resulted in you paying back that customer a part of his loss?

Here is how it works:
These mother fuckers BTP Flap are now operating under a new name called Miners Center Inc. ( These scum bags are issuing press release to promote their scam.
*** PLEASE SPREAD THE WORD EVERYWHERE ABOUT THESE JOKERS ***
Here is their latest story
Miners Center Inc. offering 10 % more than market value for bitcoins .
Miners Center Inc. ( Delaware based cryptocurrency trader announced today that it has put a offer on the table for Bitcoin sellers, as it's revealing its new cryptocurrency investment policy and appetite. The company has launched a market break-through offer on Bitcoin trade, sustaining a buying rate which is 10% higher than market's official rate.
The offer has been promoted with no time-frame, although the company explained that, according to its policy and the capacities targeted, it is likely that the offer will be just dropped, with no prior notice, the moment when sales target is reached.
Miners Center Inc. was founded in July 2014 by former banking professional Emilian Tourey, who has seen the opportunity and future financial market development going on the way of technology, while cryptocurrency will flourish. "It will eventually go mainstream within the financial system and we're not very far from that point, it's only a matter of few years," declared Emilian Tourey, the company's CEO.
The company has started as a moderate cryptocurrency buyer and investor, having seen great business opportunity in the emergence of alternative currency markets but with no means of putting uncertainty risk at the core of its business development, up until now.
MinersCenter has on-going negotiations for becoming the first Bitcoin exchange house serving a couple of major consumer goods online vendors who are now turning their faces and policies towards Bitcoin acceptance. Along with those, discussions are getting close to signing with an important online Casino, also willing to implement Bitcoin use for its services.
In this pursuit MinersCenter has developed a purchase strategy aiming to pool all the sellers who want to benefit from the company's latest offer and who are willing to sell their Bitcoin for the best deal available on the market.
All the details related to the company's offer and other information, together with the contact details of the Sales Team are available on their website:

thanks for the reply.. I still don't understand how this transaction:
that i sent from the jaxx wallet here:
with high fee and it won't confirm.. From this wallet i have sent before and it confirmed, but this last one did not..I have indeed some 70s/b transactions, but those were sent from kryptokit which is discontinued. 
Here is another one, with high fee that seems to have been split and shared with other amounts..
so, no i`m not daft, i honestly don't get what is happening
