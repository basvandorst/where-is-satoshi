Is there really that much bitcoin hate?
And why would it matter in general?

These  non clear walls people keep building their houses out of is leading to a very dark place. 
People can do what they want in their own house. We have no way of watching them from outside.
Imagine if terrorists got ahold of a house with non clear walls. They could build a dirty bomb and blow it up in Time Square.

BUT, anyone can do that. I can send up a table with a sign and exchange what ever currency for bitcoin.
But I sure as shit can send any currency myself around the world.

No, he promotes shit he like all the time. 
That pickle company, C2o, ANYONE who has ever been on his podcast. Thats just off the top of my head. Does he promote his own products? Yes who wouldn't.

Someone eventually will break into one of those things...... Physically looking for actual coins.

Bitcoin makes the a lot of cents(pun) in the Philippines. Not only do they have a huge tourism economy but they also have a large number of Phillipno citizens leave the country to  work in other countries. They end up sending large amounts of money back to their families. 
All of this is heavily fee'd. (is that a word?) Weather it in the transfer of money or in exchanging of the money. The ability to transfer money around without having to pay a troll toll every time would do great things for a country that is very poor.

Well here is a slightly more digestible version for someone who has not Idea what bitcoin is.

Kinda ya, but I don't see why it would matter unless it was feuling legislation. 
@_date: 2014-10-25 04:50:33
Probably, but I want to see someones face when they realize there are not coins. Just stupid green rectangles. 
@_date: 2014-12-03 21:58:41
100% agree.

Guns compared to bitcoin doesn't work here.
Because I can't shoot someone with a bitcoin.

Well the permit is only given to those who prove they have X amount of Skill.
Just like a driver licence.
These seems like a good idea to me considering the consequences to having untested or permitted drivers or doctors.
Hair stylist on the other hand should not need permits. I dont mind if they do to school to get a degree to prove to customers they have X amount of skill. But anyone should be able to cut hair.

I have seen plenty of crazy fucked up ads on the original silk road. I can not say if they were valid or not but I definitely saw them. There were barely any and 99% of the ads were for drugs. Drugs will always be in the same area of horrible things as long as they come with a multiple year sentence for distributing them.

Does anyone know if this is legal? I am assuming the bank doesn't do anything illegal IF they are making a paper trial and sending people notices. 
@_date: 2015-02-13 18:09:48
Well this si so the obvious answer is YES.
My only issues is that with bitcoins semi negative shady look, i think I better for PR for both sides to avoid each other till its Pot is totally legal.
Just an idea though.
