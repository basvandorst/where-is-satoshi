That’s a lot of cash. If you are going that route it’s cheaper to start a company and apply for BOI privileges. It can be 100% foreign owned 0% corporate tax for 5 to 8 years depends on the category etc.

He thinks the same thing in 2017.

Well if thats the case you have 2 problems; 1. You will need to submit your documents (proof of identification) and 2. you really should find out why you are coming up as if you are in China. Are you running a VPN? Go here and see where your IP shows your located:

Are we in a bubble? Im holding because I don't agree that bitcoin is in a bubble. Will we see a potential massive correction? Possibly. Will the media call that massive correction the bubble bursting, possibly. At the end of the day, I believe that blockchain is here to stay. I also believe Bitcoin has great value, therefore I invest, use it and help friends and family when they have questions.

500,000 THB. At the current growth rate, we will probably hit that by Christmas!

You can sign up for a [QuadrigaCX]( and transfer your coins there and then cash out to your bank account.

He's involved with pyramid schemes (Bitconnect &amp; Hashflare). With all of his referral bonuses he happens to be sitting at the top of the pyramid.

Have you gone through the verification process?

@_date: 2017-12-08 07:59:04
And for those few minutes you were dead to me!
Welcome back BTW.
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:58:39
Why do you think that?
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:19:12
So, can I ask what position have you taken (assuming you have bitcoin in your portfolio)? Are you holding through the dip, selling now or soon and buying back in on the dip?
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:36:23
This is a correction. Its a healthy part of the growth process. Just hold. If you need, stop looking at the prices go out and buy an ice-cream.
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:42:11
Where are you trying to buy it from? Gdax? Coinbase?

Curious, is there an advantage over the S9?

Not hard but you will need to get hired by a company. There isn’t a freelance or digital nomad visa. If you are a digital nomad you can get a work permit through this company:  they require a % of your monthly income though.

When he says it could end badly, what is he talking about? My thoughts and please correct me if Im totally off on this one, is that if it crashes like 40%, 50% or 60% it will eventually climb back up. For me ending badly is bitcoin breaks (I know not possible) and the protocol just stops. Outside of that, what is the could end badly thing?

I see that your twitter account has been deleted. Can I ask, who won the "Limited Edition Gold KeepKey"?

Not too long ago they were using lasers to try to impede the facial recognition so they would not get recognized. Withdrawing all your money would certainly put you on the list that they were trying to avoid...

By the way its going now, I think it will reach 1 million in about 10 minutes!

No, within about 10 mins! Its coming!

I think everyone is pumped about eating his own left ball. Maybe the thought is to get the level so high that he just eats his whole body!
@_date: 2017-11-08 13:54:55
I did the same and I agree with the suckness when it went back up again.

SNM_2_0, you seem pretty sure of yourself. So lets have a little bet, you know put your money where your mouth is. If on December 11th Bitcoin falls to 1000 USD or below, I will buy you 2 bitcoin or the equivalent in any alt coin. If it doesn't then you buy me 1 bitcoin wherever the price is. Deal?
@_date: 2017-11-07 06:39:37
Alternative coins; ETH, NEO, XMR, XRP, LTC etc.
@_date: 2017-11-28 03:31:01


If you don't want to, then don't and **hold**. Even if it dips and you 'lose' your profit for a short period of time it will come back up to an ATH, that's of course if history repeats itself which is has time and time again.
This of course is my opinion.

Almost every (or every) exchange will want the same verification. If you don't want to go through that because you find it invasive or creepy than you have the option of  You will setup a wallet and then buy directly from someone around you.
