These sorts of dark arts may be our only hope.

Even with a Trezor I just somehow expect my coins to be stolen. It's always stressful plugging in my trezor(s).
I don't know how anyone could keep their coins on some website. Fuck me.

Such a crazy thing to wake up to, I had expected it to fall back down. It's like a dream, a very very brilliant dream.

Also want these, anyone have a link to originals?

I paid for a haircut what is now worth several thousands dollars just to get my barber to accept bitcoin. She still has it luckily for her.

You should buy their house out from under them and then threaten to kick them out.

Not a millionaire but having a year off work, working on a game I always wanted to write, made new friends, now live right in the centre of the city, doing things I want to do.
All because I bought in the second dip last year. And yes, I now realise I paid absurd money buying things with bitcoin. I paid for a haircut in bitcoin - those coins are now worth almost £1000! Lol. My barber still has them, she was asking me how to sell them. I told her sell enough to recover the cost of the haircut and keep the rest!
I'm making no long term plans, just plans for the rest of the year then I guess back to some sort of work. I don't have enough coins to retire... well... unless they keep going up in value :D

Exactly what my sister did. She is sure she has mastered the coin now. She cannot lose.

7.7BTC here. For some weed and some adderall. Fucking hell. That's like 40grand or so now.
That said this just made me boot up my old laptop and I discovered my old drugs ordering wallet still had 0.1btc in it :D :D

Holy shite looks like almost quarter of a dozen of us!!

Good chance people think cashing out at 9k will allow them to 'get away with it' before people cash out at 10k.
Something similar happened back at 4/5k.
I've decided to keep mine until 2020 though. Then see if I can buy a house or similar.

Today I bought Twinings instead of Tesco tea.
Superbly celebrating.
@_date: 2019-06-26 15:04:33
Don't worry man, I bought a house @ 12k in the crazy 18k run in 2017 and I'm still really happy I did. Sure I could have got more if I'd waited but I've had such a cool time living here, made loads of new friends, just have a better life. So I'm happy, I hope you are too!
@_date: 2017-11-06 19:37:41
I am actually looking for a flat. But I would do this. Save having to cash out etc.

As the only Geordie with bitcoin tis an amazing day, with this fortune I can buy myself a house and some coal.
@_date: 2017-11-27 15:03:42
Yeah, i'll just check my silkroad and alphabay wallet.
Oh. Oh no.

I love these stories and hope the people who got random BTC a few years back still have access to it. I've posted this before but I paid my barber in BTC and the BTC is currently worth £1255. She still has it and has moved it to a trezor.

Also in the UK, at Natwest today and the person dealing with me was asking about Bitcoin in an enthusiastic way this is quite different to last year when they laughed at me... give it another year and they will be trusting Bitcoin as an asset I think.

For the first time since &lt;$1000 I'm actually considering buying more. I sold a decent amount at 17000 and I'd quite like to get all that back at this discounted rate. I'm pretty sure in the long game it will be back over 10k this year.

UK checking in just to confirm we still use the measurements too. There is just something satisfying about a foot long sandwich.

Sadly this sort of thing happens all the time in the business world. You just sort of get used to it, especially when you're dealing with companies overseas. If I could get back all the money I've had stolen like this I could retire tomorrow. I've just got used to putting it down as a loss and continuing on.
Essentially you have two options now. 1) You can put this behind you or 2) you can be driven mad by it, keeping you awake at night, talking to everyone about it, wanting revenge and so on. 
Try to go with option 1 but use learn from the experience.
It sucks, I know, but if they went bankrupt that money isn't coming back. Look forward, work harder than you would have done, try to make up for the lost money in other ways. The feeling of loss will pass.

Trezor are struggling to deal with growing as a company at crazy speed. They are setting up distributors in each country. I guess they will have someone in the USA to deal with this in the coming weeks/months.

Well for some of us because the value just keeps going towards the moon any purchases are sort of free (due to the value going up) and free from tax/conversion to other currency (you might have to pay tax on your 'profits').

I'd had over 1 btc in a tor site from last year. Thought at the time my account had been stolen by the site owners, but no, I'd just got the password backwards after finding it written down a few days ago. Log in. Coin still there. Straight to hardware wallet. Happy days.

Bitbargain is probably the best route for this guy, I agree.
@_date: 2017-06-24 00:14:16
There is a way, if you're registered correctly as a business or self-employed, to close your business and pay 10% tax on all sold off assets. Other BTC owners have done this in the UK. Follow it up.
