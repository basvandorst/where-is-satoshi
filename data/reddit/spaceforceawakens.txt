Ah, I see. You're one of those "the government is an evil entity" people who think that taxes shouldn't exist at all. You think that if we let people choose exactly where every cent of their taxes is spent we'd have roads? We sure as hell wouldn't have vaccines or an army or help for the disabled. 
Your distrust of the government is something I can understand, however don't let it confuse you into some black-and-white situation where you think that every politician is evil and only out to get money or that society can't come together from time to time to uphold the public good. There is such a thing as being so cynical that it's a detriment.

Most people don't have enough to save for retirement, you mean. That shit went away with my parent's generation.
I had a 401k, but when my former company went out of business it disappeared. Poof. Gone. The idea that everyone can save money for retirement is an old one and not at all realistic for most people today.
@_date: 2019-07-10 06:22:46
If everyone got to pick where their tax money went directly then we'd have no roads. There would be far more people begging in the streets. It's not about people wanting the resources, it's about allocating them where they'll do the best good for society as a whole. 
The government doesn't "steal" those resources; the government makes sure you pay everyone contributes if they can. If you can't contribute to society as a whole then you shouldn't be a part of it. But that includes using publicly funded things such as the Internet, which you are using right now.
If making sure that we have clean drinking water and bridges over rivers and an army to hold off other armies then, sure, I'm evil. I'm ok with that.
But really your comment is proving my point -- you're calling me evil for expecting people to contribute to the greater good. If people got to choose where all of their money went we'd not have any of those bridges or water or civilization as a whole. Libertarians can't seem to look past their own noses to how the world around them is connected to them, and how they're connected to the rest of the world. It's not evil to want to make our country civilized, it's evil -- and selfish -- to pretend that you're above that kind of thing.
@_date: 2019-07-10 05:43:51
He's a libertarian. In a libertarian's world, they are the only one who matters. There is no such thing as a common good unless it directly benefits them. People are poor because they choose to be, or because the government takes all of their money. All taxes are theft. 
Seriously, that is their world view. I used to be one and I'm ashamed of myself for feeling that way. It is the ultimate in selfishness-as-a-lifestyle.
@_date: 2019-07-10 05:44:32
Exactly. So what happens if the market takes a dip or there's another bad recession? Then that money is gone. That's the "security" part of social security. This guy is an idiot.
@_date: 2019-07-10 08:17:45
Excellent points, and I'll have to respond to them when I wake up, except for that last bit.
I may have phrased that poorly. How about, "if you won't contribute to the greater good then you shouldn't be a part of it". It wasn't about what a person can do, but rather what they're willing to do. I am  a tired man.
Also, are we having a rational discussion about politics in This might be a first.
BITCOIN TO $50K BY FRIDAY, PEOPLE!

I think that OP feels that the government is seizing social security from citizens against their will, and if said citizens were using bitcoin (or another crypto) then the government couldn't seize it. Or something.

Yeah, some people don’t tip. Those people are dicks. You can’t use the actions of dicks to justify being less-of-a-dick, but still KINDA a dick.
And it IS cool of some levels, as I said, I like it in spirit, but people who gets tips usually live on them — it’s not a bonus. Making anyone jump through hoops to get money they need for rent — even cool ones like yours — is shitty.
@_date: 2019-03-24 03:31:55
I re-read it and I guess I see what you mean about them already into crypto. That, of course, is fine. It read a little more ambiguous though. 
@_date: 2019-03-25 04:11:17
1) "I couldn't give a damn about it's supposed reputation." Well there's your problem. It won't get wider adoption until it's bad rap is flushed out of the popular conversation. I'm here with three of my buddies -- none of the nerds, into finance, or anything like that -- and all three of them, independently, said, "Bitcoin? Isn't that a scam?"
And that's the little problem. The big problem is guys like you who can't see past their own wallet to the bigger picture. We need to work to get the rep of crypto, especially bitcoin, back into the green. Leaving paper tips for $10 won't do that. If someone thinks it's a scam -- which is very probably -- they'll think the tip is a scam. It doesn't matter that I know that it's not, that you know that it's not, it matters what *the rest of the people think. The general acceptance of crypto requires that we shed that negative image. 
I get the feeling that  you're either a financial bro or a silicon valley duder, either way you seem to be in a bubble that doesn't reflect the reality of the rest of the world.
2) I don't mean literally leave a $50 tip. I meant that $50 would be worth their while to learn the ins and outs of crypto, whether it's a tip or not. $10 for most people won't do it.
3) This isn't about the intelligence of anyone. I'm sure they can figure it out. It's about the willingness, patience, and the overall fitting into their lives. Do you really believe that people working service jobs are blind to the bigger issues of economics and the world of finance? They're not blind to it, they just have bigger issues to deal with. I mentioned rent before, but how about student loans or daycare? Those require US dollars right now, so US dollars are what you should tip with unless otherwise requested. Opting people in to something without asking or warning is, in general, not a good idea.
4) Because idealist platitudes and tipping in crypto would be great in a world where crypto is easier to use and more common, but we're not in that world. I think we will be, but we're simply not there yet. I do admire where the heart is, the willingness to just go for it, but I'm disapprove of the inability to see how this could affect the people who get affected by it the most. When the idealists put their ideals ahead of the needs of actual people -- even if those ideals are good ones -- it doesn't do anyone any good.

@_date: 2019-03-24 22:25:35


Do you even know how the service industry works? To split up the crypto 12 ways requires more work than it's worth for a person who isn't into crypto already.
Bitcoin is not easy enough yet for this kind of thing to be effective.
Again, I love it in spirit, but in execution it's lacking.
@_date: 2019-03-24 22:23:26
Those are two hoops. Then you have to find a marketplace to sell the crypto, which for many is a daunting task. There's such a negative buzz around bitcoin because a lot of people have created a lot of scams. There's a lot of misinformation. Just figuring it out is hoops. Hoops everywhere. Too many hoops.
This kind of shit is what turns people off form bitcoin and other crypto, not turns them on.
@_date: 2019-03-24 13:24:03
Next time try adding the little details like that into the post. I missed it completely because I don't have the patience to wade through this shit storm.
But some of the other people in these threads. Jesus fucking christ on a cronut.
@_date: 2019-03-23 02:32:07
Yeah, exactly this. I like what OP is doing in spirit, but as a guy who worked in service, this would just piss me off.
Whoever gets that isn't thinking, "oh cool, crypto!" they're thinking, "so I have to learn shit, download it, configure it, then sell this crypto to put $5 in my gas tank!?" It's really going to do more to turn people off of crypto.
Unless, as the nice person before me said, it's like $50. If it's $5 or even $10, it's just like the "fake $20s" evangelical christians leave instead of tips.  Just leave cash. They need cash.
@_date: 2019-03-27 10:19:20
I actually came here to ask about this.
Are you going to offer flat rates or will you have a per-kWh metering in place? I had a small mine here in Seattle going until it got too expensive. Okanagon is out there, but that has many advantages.
Are you open to new customers/business proposals/cases of beer?
@_date: 2019-03-24 13:21:53
But there will likely be multiple other dollar bills in there, so that the total being split up is easier to do.
And splitting a dollar bill is easy. It comes out to a 1/100th fraction called a penny.
@_date: 2019-03-24 13:19:26
A tip that the person getting it has to jump through hoops to use. What if I took some of your rent money and told you that you can't have it unless you learn some obscure-to-you shit that you don't care about?
@_date: 2019-03-28 19:32:38
I know that this is going to be unpopular, but it needs to be said: This is fucking terrible advice, OP.
It's true that the bolivar is worthless and they're in economic dire straits. But bitcoin, like any crypto, needs two things that we take for granted to work that they have in short supply: Electricity and an Internet connection.
I work for a guy who's been doing exactly what you're describing for the last few months. The product is solid, the developers are all in Venezuela, and they were all paid via bitcoin. But then they lost their connectivity and a short time later their power.
They cannot work. They cannot upload their work so others can work on it. They cannot get paid. They cannot invoice. They are utterly cut off from my boss and the other members of management. The main dev hasn't been heard from in almost two weeks. We don't even know if he's alive.
The project is on indefinite hold.  That means none of us are getting paid while they're busy deciding if they'll have a civil war or not.
And now the Russians are there, and who knows what the fuck they're going to do.
So, OP, while I like your idea in theory, it's not at all practical, and leads to even more problems, and further highlights some of the shortcomings of crypto when it comes to using it as a day-to-day currency.
Granted, Venezuela is an extreme example, but that goes more to the point that throwing crypto at the problem won't fix it.
@_date: 2019-03-24 23:40:34
1) I'm not saying bitcoin is to blame directly, or even indirectly. But that's not the point: Bitcoin comes up when people mention internet scams. The ransomware shit that happened a couple years ago is a great example. The ransomers wanted to be paid in bitcoin, and for people who aren't familiar, all they hear is "ransom in bitcoin" and associate it negatively. I'm saying bitcoin has an image problem -- even though it shouldn't -- and shit like this doesn't help.
2) Why sell it? Because landlords don't take bitcoin! Why can't you guys understand that for service workers tips aren't a bonus or "fun money", it's how they live? "Why sell it?" Because they need real money in the real world.
Elsewhere in this thread I posted it's the same as the people who leave religious tracts as tips. Their heart is in the right place, but it doesn't do anybody any good.
*Forcing* people to use a crypto to get the fiat money that they currently need in their pocket negatively affects the crypto, the worker, and the community as a whole.
@_date: 2019-03-25 02:36:46
1) I was saying bitcoin is *not* to blame, but that doesn't mean it doesn't have a bad reputation with some people. And it's not about "shunning", it's about practicality. Any currency is only as good as how accepted it is for goods and services, right? Bitcoin, sadly, is not to the point yet that it's practical for tipping in this way.
2) OK, lemme unpack this.
a) A tip itself is not going to pay the rent, but a tip will go towards the rent. Straight towards, no having *to learn new shit* to make it work. I'm not sure why you can't seem to understand that a crypto's worth is always what the holder values it at. To a person ignorant of the crypto, it may have none. Thus, this stunt will likely do more to *turn people off* from crypto than entice them to *learn* about it. At least for $10. Make it $50 and it's a different story, but the majority of people in the service industry whom I know -- and it's a lot of people -- would just throw this away without learning about it. $10 isn't worth their time, and they'd be annoyed that it wasn't dollars, the widely accepted coin of the realm.
b) Again, I understand the incentive, and I understand what you're saying about religion. Let's use tips to introduce people to crypto. It's a fine sentiment, except, for the reasons stated above, it's impractical, as people who work for tips have more important things to do than learn about crypto! Right now, crypto is the playground of nerds, visionaries, and people who understand economics and finance. That person is generally not the person at the coffee shop making the latte. That's a student or single mom who isn't into crypto because they have to make sure they can pay all the bills. It's *hard enough to do without people slipping alternative currencies into the mix*! Do you understand that part? The idealism is commendable, it really is, but in execution it causes more problems than it solves.
c) If you're giving someone a tip in a crypto currency, then they're forced to use a crypto currency, aren't they?
You've got all kinds of platitudes, many of the laudable, but you fail to grasp the problem that slipping crypto into a tip jar does more harm that good, and can add one more problem to the lives of people who have enough already.

Right, there's nothing I see there about Ragan ordering Ol' Ollie to do anything. Not sure what you're referencing there?
@_date: 2019-08-30 23:09:52
I've got a buddy who I got into crypto way back in 2010 or so. He built a mining machine and gathered a grand total of 26 BTC. He got bored of it, so he wanted to convert it into a gaming rig. He backed up the wallet onto a thumbdrive, wipe the machine, re-installed Windows, and went to work.
Somewhere between his apartment and his job he lost the thumbdrive. So that means that somewhere in Seattle is an old thumbdrive worth about a quarter of a million bucks. Idiot.
@_date: 2019-10-22 02:29:26
As far as I recall there was never any evidence that Reagan personally directed the crack sales thing, but that it was the brainchild of one of the other implicated members of the scandal, no?

Don't you mean communist or free market?
@_date: 2019-06-27 04:44:02
This is the best one of these. I get the feeling that if BTC drops a slight bit again, maybe to below $11k, then there will be a moderate sell off, then the old-timers will snatch it up, which will drive it even higher, then they'll all feel like chumps, then we'll get more of these.
Or something. I can't even keep track anymore.
@_date: 2019-10-22 04:11:16
Sorry but that’s not right, either. He answered guilty to charges of lying to Congress and obstruction-related crimes. The crack to the bloods and crips via the anti-Sandinistas was a tertiary development and had nothing to do with Iran-Contra directly.
Some of the money that the Contras got was indeed used to supply crack in LA and San Francisco, but that was hardly directed from the conspirators, especially Ollie and Ron.
I used to be a journalist and covered this all when Ollie tried to run for Congress. It was a popular conspiracy theory but it simply wasn’t how things went down.

I fully expect that young man is right. Instead of the larger stand-alone ATMs I've been looking at the smaller "teller" style desktop/countertop models.

I'm probably moving back there in a year or so, and I was thinking of spreading a few BTC ATM around, but then I did a search and they are everywhere down there. I'm up in Seattle and they're everywhere here, too, so I always found it weird when people post pics of their local ATMs. I'm like, "so?" But then I did a bit or research, and I'm like, "oh."

Let's say your reddit karma was a crypto, but Internet-wide, and you can kind of get it.

Okung is the man. I met him in Seattle in 2012 or so at a campaign event for the Mayor. He was on the IR at the time and pissed off that he had to wait to get off of it per league rules, even though he was ready to go. He said the good part was that he could drink all he wanted and not get into trouble, so we did a couple shots with his wife, who was a sweetheart. Then we talked about playing Halo, best place to get a Macbook fixed in Seattle, and then he was kind enough to send a short video message to a friend of mine who was a huge fan of his.
Him being into crypto does not surprise me one little bit. Dude's one of us.
