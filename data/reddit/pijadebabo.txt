It will be valued according to the efforts you've put in ("waiting"), a.k.a. nothing
@_date: 2019-09-28 17:59:25
Yes but 100% of the dollar's value comes from it being a tax credit.

Why is there no one here. Last threads 7 hours ago

None of that adds any value, if basic value is absent.
To give you an example: your house is worth $300,000 and you start dreaming: "I wish I could fit my house into my pocket, to hide it from the taxman."
And someone says: "This proves that my lighter is worth more than $300,000 because it actually does fit into my pocket."
Well this is true, but the fundamenal value of the lighter is $3 and not $300,000.
So the fundamental value of bitcoin is $0 and it being portable doesn't help.
@_date: 2019-09-28 06:26:52
Yeah but that is not relevant to my point. All taxes in the U.S. are demanded in dollars. Otherwise, punishments await (kicked out of home by IRS, imprisoned).
So to avoid these penalties, USD is the get out of jail card. That is what gives fiat money value.
And it is completely missing in cryptos!

If you have $8000 in cash one of side of the table, and Nothing on the other, what would I grab
@_date: 2019-09-28 06:36:50
Yes, stocks are actually valuable because they promise to one day pay Dividend.
Gold is valuable due to its direct usages.
Bitcoin has NONE of the above.
@_date: 2019-09-28 06:01:44
Very good questions, don't let these yescoiners a.k.a. nomoneyers steer you wrong.
The correct answers are as follows
The dollar has value solely because it is the thing needed to pay taxes.
Bitcoin is completely worthless
@_date: 2019-09-29 08:31:29
Usually computers get much faster. For example my 1988 hard drive was just 80 MB and today 80 MB can even be internet speed in just 1 second.
So, if bitcoin today is spending Years to make calculations, wouldn't that be equivalent to 1 second of calculations in the near future.
@_date: 2019-09-28 06:46:52
Yeah but my theory is that ALL purchasers of bitcoin are actually waiting to RESELL it higher.
So nobody wants the thing, and the name of the game is to resell to a greater fool.
So, you remarking that "someone wants it" is actually not enough to prove that it isn't ultimately worthless ($0).
@_date: 2019-09-29 05:00:12
Because in the early days (2017) all bitcoin stories were success stories.
Now 2 years later, most stories are shaping to be Horror stories ("I bought at $15,000 and it's now $7,500")
@_date: 2019-09-28 06:56:53
I knew you would say that, that is why I added "promise of dividend."
Meaning, some companies aren't yet profitable, but their Future Earnings are where the potential value lies.
Cryptos have no earnings.
@_date: 2019-09-29 18:59:50
It is astounding how many people believe this is a "sure thing."
"I'm not worried if it goes to 6900. I will simply invest all my net worth into it at that point, problem solved."
@_date: 2019-09-28 15:08:14
Yeah but if you dropped the value from $3 to $0 then the teleportation would be worthless.
Namely, I am now sending you the letter A quickly: A A A A A A A A A A A A A A. But you don't feel like compensating me.
That is why BTC is worth nothing
@_date: 2019-09-11 03:04:16
Simple, bitcoin will fail and collapse to zero.
@_date: 2019-09-29 05:10:11
That implies that you "know" that 6000 is low. What if the next level is 0.6 dollars, how is 6000 low then.
@_date: 2019-09-28 18:21:44
Yes but that is circular. "I am the pope because the pope is infallible and I said I was the pope."
So it cannot be the case that Bitcoin is valuable because it is the thing needed to access the very valuable thing called Bitcoin.

So I need to pay $8100 in cash in order to prove that a .pdf file existed in 2018.
I'm sure that can be done for $0 already
@_date: 2019-09-26 09:00:34
Yes, I will explain it. It's because dollars pay taxes, and derive their value from that fact.
@_date: 2019-09-29 20:53:06
The dollar is needed to pay tax.
@_date: 2019-09-29 10:11:35
Every 30 years computers speed up by 1,000,000,000 times.
So, today's ridiculous "mining" that takes years, should be equivalent to less than 1 second in 2059. Does that make sense? If not, then bitcoin is a dubious proposition.

I will tell 2 quick jokes and you can spot the similarity with bitcoin.
Why does Mo purposely buy shoes that are smaller than his size? Because of the awesome relief when he takes them off.
Two guys meet in a desert, one's carrying a phone booth and the other an anvil. He explains: "This is protection against lions. When lion comes, I shut myself in the booth. Wbu?"
- "My anvil is also against lions. When one comes, I throw the anil away, and this enables me to run faster."
So, the joke is that you shouldn't create difficulty, and then pretend that removing it later on is an overall improvement.
So therefore, why would you solve your own mathematical tasks (bitcoin).
@_date: 2019-09-29 10:31:42
So bitcoin mining is unrelated to computer speeds?
@_date: 2019-09-29 19:11:23
I remember 15 years ago on Yahoo Finance chat, you could select "Strong Buy, Buy, Hold, Sell, Strong Sell" next to your post.
So, the concept of Hold has been present for tens, probably hundreds of years.
Suddenly in 2018 bitcoiners start saying HODL like it's something they just invented, so they play with it.
It would be like saying "Hey I invented something new, I like to jokingly call it Sullpy and Demand."
@_date: 2019-09-28 07:06:56
OK When I said resell, I include spending in that.
The point is, you cannot ENJOY your bitcoin, your actual ultimate goal is to get rid of it.
Given that... everyone else ought to try to get rid of it too a.k.a. it's going to zero.
@_date: 2019-09-09 08:56:13
Yeah it is
@_date: 2019-09-28 19:12:53
OK So give me a 9-character sample of something that you think is contained on bitcoin.
For example this is a 2-character sample of my name: LI.
Now write me something bitcoin contains

Q: Why is bitcoin the stupidest thing in history?
A: Because Flat Earth doesn't consume 1 trillion gigawats of power
@_date: 2019-09-28 18:41:05
You could have skipped the "access" part and just told me what this magnificent value of blockchain was.
But something tells me you have no answer, and writings on the blockchain are pure Crap.
