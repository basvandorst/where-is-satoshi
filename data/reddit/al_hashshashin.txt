umm ... yay?

lol ... it's like trying to buy drugs.
@_date: 2014-07-01 02:24:21
oh spare us.
If some nobody who's looking for his five minutes of fame can threaten bitcoin then you better sell now.
@_date: 2014-07-01 04:14:21
I don't care if he wants to turn all the bitcoins into bananas and shove them up his ass.
He's a nobody who is no threat to bitcoin and you should feel stupid for considering him dangerous.
@_date: 2014-07-01 04:24:47
I was on the fence on whether you were an idiot or a troll.
Thanks for clearing that up for me.
@_date: 2014-11-07 05:17:28
hehe - "Hey Mom!"
That's what I imagined it was like too.
@_date: 2014-08-31 20:13:30
There's un-owned bitcoins?
Many bitcoins have been misplaced forever (forgotten passwords and broken hardware) I suppose, but other than that ... all bitcoins are owned. Your question makes no sense.
@_date: 2014-12-12 04:16:36
keep your money brother.
this microsoft thing is gonna make us *all* rich!
@_date: 2014-07-06 04:47:54
well ... eight years ago she submitted a video link and then seven and a half years later she started posting (somewhat eloquently) about bitcoin.
your first instinct seems good.
@_date: 2014-07-11 21:27:34
so then, xhamster.com remains a free site and it's live cam girls that accept bitcoin.
the only thing new about this is that there is now one less way to see free cam girls.
I'm gonna have to think this one over before allowing it.

Does this mean we can stop tipping now?
Because I'm down to my last twelve cents ... thirty, forty more tips max.
@_date: 2014-08-31 20:47:50
Another nonsensical question.
If the details of supply and demand (for any commodity, not just bitcoin) were completely known to the market there would be little to no price fluctuation.
You want to know the unknowable and it's making you look stupid.
Please stop.
@_date: 2015-01-13 03:59:33
lol ... you think $285 was *before* the bottom dropped out?
@_date: 2014-11-08 09:32:18
ooooo ... 2.1 cents
wow so profit
much spend
many good life
need wallet
so not happening
Hey Mom!
@_date: 2015-09-09 01:30:58


lol ... didn't you read the proposal?
zip, nada ... they have $30 K in capital (Dave the marketing guy's mom got a second mortgage on the house) and you get "equity share". This means you get half of negative 30 K ... you work for free and you owe Dave 15K.
They (Dave and the "two PHDs") want you to kick in 15K *and* show them how to trade?
sign me up Dave.

If by "pops" you mean went down 13% in a single day ... then yeah, I guess [TWTR]( popped.
@_date: 2013-12-08 21:53:12
why didn't you say that then, that based on your sentiment or opinion you thought what you did?
instead you insinuated that you were some kind of chart expert ("looking at the btc charts, and I do a ton of stock trading") and that you saw some technical support.
it's obvious to anyone who is familiar with a chart that bitcoin had no history in the $700 range so anybody who was claiming expertise and seeing support there was talking out of their ass.
so yeah, we're in agreement ... you're full of shit.
that said, congrats on the prediction ... for the moment anyway. The price has settled around $700 and I hope it stabilizes there, or somewhere. I don't care if it drops to a hundred again as long as it stabilizes.
i've got a real need for bitcoin as a currency, both on the buy and sell side, and I need it to be stable, to be useful. I've no interest in speculating in it ... I need to be able to use it.
don't tell me how much it's worth, tell me how much it's being adopted.
@_date: 2013-12-07 09:38:43
oh bullshit
bitcoin rocketed through $700 on its way up, and has now plunged back through $700. 
there is no possible technical indication of support of any kind at this level in this kind of chart, this is all new territory.
the only possible case to be made for support was the $950 level it bounced off a couple of times (even that "support" didn't last long) and anyone interpreting any kind of support at any level is full of shit because bitcoin has never been in this position before.
It does seem to have a ceiling though, somewhere around the price of an ounce of gold, coincidental or otherwise.
edit: seriously ... looking at a bitcoin chart with a technical analysis at the moment is a bad idea. The technical indications look disastrous actually ... the support is like $150 or something and the trend is obvious.
@_date: 2013-12-29 07:30:03
I'm having a great time.
I thought that would be obvious.
But now, you've come along and ruint it for me.
Why? 
Why would you choose a famous author as part of your name and then spell his name wrong?
Wrecked my whole day. I can't even muster up the will to swear at anybody any more.
@_date: 2013-12-18 09:24:29
c'mon ... you guys are killin' me here.
the "economic" speculations coming out this sub are childlike.
china has about a trillion dollars in US Treasuries
china is known to have 3500 metric tonnes of gold in reserve, and it's probably much more than that.
china had a trade surplus with America alone, in November alone, of over a third of a billion dollars.
the total market cap of bitcoin at the moment is somewhere around six or seven billion dollars, small potatoes in the real world.
if the chinese wanted all the bitcoin they would just buy all the fuckin bitcoin
why, would they want to do such a thing?
if bitcoin is monopolized (which it's in danger of, but not by China) it becomes worthless.

lol ... I love reddit
@_date: 2013-12-29 03:54:15
Shut up fuckface.
The very [post]( before this one you spelled I with an i. How does that work in your brain fuckface?
And looking at your history you're apparently a dickwad fuckface, the worst kind of fuck-face.
Yeah, I hyphenated fuckface because I felt like it.
Fuck you fucking fuckface.
The fucking word is losing all fucking meaning you stupid fucking fuckface.

Of course you're libertarian ... we all want freedom and liberty in our lives ... we just disagree on the best way to achieve that.
Big L libertarians wrongly believe that freedom can be achieved by ridding ourselves of law and regulation, that when the yoke of government is thrown off we will be truly free, that markets and free will and the innate self interest of man will ensure us liberty.
I'm a commie libertarian, a libertarian of the left.
I understand that the remarkable freedoms I enjoy right now here in the west are a direct result of government, of democracy. Until recently, only a few hundred years ago, only a select few people enjoyed the type of freedom available to the masses in the first world today and it certainly wasn't Libertarianism that brought that about, it was the American revolution ... America's greatest gift to the world ... democracy and the rule of law.
Libertarianism as a political system is as unworkable and unrealistic in today's crowded world as Communism and bitcoin won't change any of that.
@_date: 2013-09-22 00:43:47
why would I give bitcoins for what I can get for free on r/cuteteens
@_date: 2013-12-17 00:33:54
thanks for making my point ... and putting Austrian right at the front of your post ... lol
@_date: 2013-12-29 07:40:06
the arrangement of letters in a correct order to communicate.
you've done it wrong, and worse, you've done it wrong in reference to a famous author.
I'm just heartbroken.
@_date: 2013-12-18 11:06:37
heya dude!
how's the economics goin' over there in Austria?
@_date: 2013-12-14 09:55:05
I'd like to thank OP for putting "Austrian" right at the beginning of the title.
It makes the downvote process much more clean and efficient.
@_date: 2013-12-14 18:59:54
yeah ... I read and up voted your post above before I saw your reply/link.
About the only thing I disagree with is your assertion that progressive liberals shoudn't be called libertarian.
Everybody's a libertarian ... who doesn't want freedoms and liberty for themselves? We just disagree on the methods of achieving those freedoms for ourselves.
@_date: 2013-12-29 06:52:38
well fuck them uncle fucka's too.
probably fuckface up there ... he seems a little bitter.
