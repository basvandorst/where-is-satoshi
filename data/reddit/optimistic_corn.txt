I truly appreciate it when someone calls me a nerd. So, thanks for calling me a nerd. Oh! And by the way, GTFO troll!

I am trying to make a point here, and that is, if you don't drive a lot, it doesn't make sense to buy a modern economical turbo-diesel because of the problems its emissions control systems will develop from low mileage. Instead, a fun to drive petrol powered car that is not very economical to drive will be better because it will not have those problems and you're not driving enough for for it to dry your wallet. Also, fixing problems with the emissions control systems in a modern diesel is a rather expensive ordeal and will most likely offset if not trump the savings you'll make from the lower fuel consumption.
P.S. Try to understand the points others are trying to make before calling them things.

I also have a very similar story. Back in early 2015, I was thinking of mining Ethereum and holding onto my earnings for at least 3 years. I came so close to doing it that I had even decided which parts would make what would have been my first mining rig. But, I didn't do it. This is only thing I regret in my life. Live and learn, I guess.

Never trust anyone and always be skeptical. Consider your lost money a fee for a lesson.

How would you mine Bitcoin in Venezuela without any mining hardware? I've read that Venezuela recently banned the import of cryptocurrency mining hardware ( Is this fake news?

We all make mistakes. Back in early 2015, I was thinking of mining Ethereum and holding my earnings for at least 3 years. But, I didn't do it. Biggest regret of my life.
Live and learn!

So many predictions... Nobody really knows what's actually going to happen and if somebody does, they'll most likely keep it to themselves and make a lot of money.
@_date: 2018-06-12 21:18:16
Now, that's called adaptation.

Me too. Sadly, looking at the current state of the cryptocurrency market that seems unlikely to happen anytime soon.

There are lot of factors that determine Bitcoin's price at any given moment. So, I am afraid we can't count on what you're saying.

Is it a C63 AMG (the one with a V8) or a C250D?

Half asheep more likely.

Mining anything on free electricity is always profitable! What you need to ask is that whether it is profitable enough to make an ROI and earn some profit before the mining hardware conks out?

Instead of Uganda, Binance should try setting up a cryptocurrency exchange in Nigeria. All those Nigerian princes will make cryptocurrency a multi-trillion dollar market in a matter of days.

If this news story is true, then, the folks over at Coinbase should stand up and say fuck you to Zuckerberg and refuse any deal with Facebook.

Why buy a diesel when you're only doing 5000 kms/year? Seriously, if I was in your shoes, I would have bought a BMW 335i. You're not driving much, so, the fuel consumption won't dent your wallet that much. Better make your drives a bit more fun and maybe hit the racetrack once in a while.

They should've been fined at least 500 billion dollars and their personnel responsible for this should've been given the death penalty. That would've served as a lesson for them and a deterrent for others in the future.

I was going to mine it to my wallet and hold it for 3 years. Mt. Gox wouldn't have affected me at all.

Bitcoin has added a 0 to its price every two years from its genesis up until now. But, it doesn't mean that this trend will continue forever. There are a lot of things that come together and decide Bitcoin's price at any given moment.

Yeah, he should sue every last penny out of those low-life airport security cunts!
