What I ask myself during dips like this is "Is this the end of cryptocurrency?"
And the answer is no, so it will recover.
When it's high, people see an opportunity to sell. When it's low people see an opportunity to buy. But a $500B+ crypto market is not going to vanish overnight. We might not beat ATHs for a while, or even get close, but we will recover to a reasonable level.

*Priority* implies that funding healthcare for children and protecting DACA dreamers are conflicting and/or contradictory goals, which they are of course not. They have nothing to do with each other. Both programs are overwhelmingly supported by the majority of Americans.
Children are being used at *leverage* to advance bad, short-sighted policy rooted in pandering to racist impulses of Trump's base.
And if you *don't* think it's rooted in racism and hide behind the argument that it's just about money, [consider the colossal GDP hit that will be incurred and the $6.3 Billion in employer turnover costs]( which will be realized immediately because none of they will have the ability to continue working.

"racist diversity" is a literal oxymoron, which makes you a regular moron


If you had skills, education, work ethic, or any combination of those, then employment wouldn't be an issue for you. Don't blame your shortcomings on immigrants.
If every last illegal immigrant was deported overnight, we would have a shitload of industries turned on their head, food shortages nationwide, a bunch of vacancies because of lack of skilled or educated labor, and even more vacancies from jobs that Americans are unwilling to take.
When you let your racism, emotions, and unemployability drive policy decisions, you scapegoat immigrants and hurt the nation.

Roger Ver is a legitimate reason not to like BCH.
Bcash is attempting to usurp Bitcoin by copying it's name and likeness, while not staying true to its principles. Bitcoin is *supposed* to be decentralized. Bcash is very much under the control of Roger Ver, and that's bad news for a cryptocurrency. Even fiat currencies aren't under the control of a *single* person.

For a community so strongly in favor of a free market with absolutely no regulation, there are an awful lot of people bitchinf and whining about what's happening with Coinbase, Bcash, and Ver. This is the free market at work people. Like it or not, most people (especially newcomers to Bitcoin) are not going to move away from Coinbase, and many will even buy into Bcash. Regardless of what you may think of it, it will be affecting the crypto landscape, and if it truly does handle transactions and/or fees better than Bitcoin, then it's got some serious competition. So even if you move away from Coinbase, Bitcoins prices being affected on Coinbase will affect you still.
Again, this is the free market at work - insider trading and all. This is what people wanted. All the bitching about it implies those same people never truly believed or understood what a free market meant.

Just by the very way you phrase it shows that you don't know what NN is.
The regulation as written states that all traffic which includes Bitcoin must be treated equally. That is what the government  is mandading. That protects Bitcoin. To use your words, an "unregulated" ISP would have no such restriction and will be free to disrupt or block Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency as they see fit.
I know many people have a misguided hardon for deregulation out of ignorance or naivety, but this regulation protects Bitcoin and consumers.
@_date: 2017-11-21 20:35:32


Are you serious? This the same FCC that argues in court that 1 ISP is a sufficient number to constitute 'competition'. At every turn they have acted in favor of corporations and anti-consumer.
You are mad and/or naive if a) you think that Title II regulations in any way shape or form inhibit innovation, b) that this won't be exploited to the fullest for corporate profit, and c) that the FCC will do *absolutely anything* to inhibit the behavior of any 'bad actor' ISP.
In fact, you can't even *define* what it means to be a bad actor, because the regulations will be so incredibly loose, that everything they do will be both completely anti-consumer, but also 100% legal.
Repealing NN completely stifles innovation, because any small business, service, or website will be forced to pay a fee to have their content delivered, thus we won't see nearly as many businesses, services, or websites popping up. The only people who will survive are the incumbents.

@_date: 2017-11-07 22:20:05
100% yes.
Any type of traffic to any destination can be throttled to absolutely nothing.
We can play games to try to obfuscate what we're doing, but ultimately, without net neutrality, your internet could be throttled down to absolutely nothing, save for the specific subset of websites who have paid for a "fast lane," assuming of course that you as the consumer have also paid for access to that fast lane. VPNs can't help you because connections to them could also be throttled - they will likely be an early target because they are going to be the first thing people try to use to circumvent throttling.
It sounds extreme to say that ISPs could deny access to all but a handful of selected IP addresses - it's certainly a worst-case scenario - but there is also no consumer protection to say that this won't happen.
@_date: 2017-11-22 15:48:56
Nobody is free to offer it, because this is not a free market. And it wasn't a free market before Title II.
Nobody can make new ISPs to compete, because ISPs won't allow it.
Net Neutrality at least makes the online landscape an even playing field so that we can at least have a true free market there. Lose net neutrality and we won't have any form of a free market.
@_date: 2017-11-22 15:54:09
Net Neutrality has existed since the inception of the internet. Once it was being threatened by ISPs demanding ransom from many companies like YouTube, Netflix, and Riot to name a few, Title II was enacted. Title II came about in 2015 to keep the net neutral.

The data and your conjecture are unrelated. Title II has NOTHING to do with investment. Absolutely zero evidence to link this. I believe the ISPs when they say that Title II does not affect investment, because *it is not in their interest to admit that*.


Because Title II was put in place before it grew out of hand.


You are willfully ignorant because millions of households and mobile users enjoy data caps. Mobile market - all data plans used to be unlimited, until they were phased out and existing customers slowly forced off their plans. Persistent customers who did not want to leave their plans were throttled.
For home internet users:
Cox services up to 20m customers, AT&amp;T 120m, CenturyLink 48m, Comcast 109m. They all have data caps along with ~200 other smaller ISPs. The only major ISP which to my knowledge doesn't do data caps (yet?) is Spectrum (formerly TWC/Charter/Bright House).
Are you still going to downplay that is a widespread problem? Is that fear mongering? No it's reality.

A Neutral Net was the de facto standard because ISPs didn't interfere with anything until high-bandwidth users came along. I'm sorry you have a short memory, but that's how it was. Just as the article states, there was no formal or clear legal protections of Net Neutrality prior to Title II in 2015, and that only came about because ISPs were testing the law and throttling to see what they could get away with. Title II nipped that in the bud and formalized what we already had. Prior to the early 2000s many people already didn't have great options for internet, so throttling consumers didn't make sense. Streaming video hadn't taken off by then either. After streaming video did take off, now people stopped subscribing to cable and ISPs were losing money that way, so throttling was a way for them to hamstring their competition like Netflix. NN stopped that, and they didn't like it one bit.

Yes, because it's been effectively done before. Look at any developed European nation. Look at Canada. Look at the US even. Regulation is everywhere and we're all reaping the benefits of it. It's nonsense that the government has a "lack of knowledge." Believing that as a rule is willful ignorance, sorry to say. Where do you think the government hires from? Oh what grounds can you say the government has a lack of knowledge?


So what you're saying here is that regulation doesn't work because capitalists will work to corrupt it, and therefore we need to get rid of regulation? Yeah, not buying that.

It needs to upgrade now and it's not happening. There needs to be protections against exchanges getting hacked and people getting robbed.

Sorry, YOU are the one who is lying. The internet is currently as it was in 1996-2015. It never changed. ISPs were moving towards throttling traffic selectively, so Title II regulations were amended to formalize and preserve that status quo of Net Neutrality. We have had Net Neutrality, uninterrupted, since the inception of the internet up until now.

When people die, if they are holding bitcoin, that will be lost forever too unless they've explicitly made arrangements. Bitcoin can't inflate, only deflate. While bitcoin being lost make all the others more valuable in the short term, when we inevitably lose bitcoin through attrition, and supply dwindles, it's going to be a hinderance to the idea of bitcoin changing the world like so many people want to believe.

So a few things here:
Repealing these rules would allow ISPs to whitelist certain domains and blacklist any other unknown traffic. So Bitcoin and VPNs would be caught up in that.
They could be incentivised to disrupt bitcoin by major financial firms or whoever else has a vested interest in seeing Bitcoin fail. Pay the ISPs, have them disrupt Bitcoin. Simple way for them to make an extra profit.
Third, VPNs are an obvious way to circumvent any restrictions, censors, or pricing packages that ISPs impose, so VPNs themselves can be targets for ISPs to be blocked and throttled.

I can't because all of them do. If there is capitalism, there is corruption. That's the point. But societies that actually take steps to make sure some industries don't become privatized and for-profit like healthcare and education fare much better. Well places consumer protection and anti-trust regulations that capitalists squeal at the thought of are essential. But if you mention simple things like that to protect consumers from predation, or prevent monopolies and promote competition, capitalists and their armies of useful-idiots will scream bloody murder and accuse you of being a communist.

Show me. How does the ISP landscape in America closely resemble a free market? Free markets require competition. That's an inconvenient truth that corporations, conservatives, and free-market advocates love to forget about. We have an [FCC headed by a Verizon lawyer who goes to court to argue that 1 ISP in a given area constitutes competition.](
If you have faith in the free market, why are you OK with losing Net Neutrality? A free market is precisely what it protects. We have an even playing field on the internet, and we are going to lose that. Now instead of competing with Netflix by offering better service (IE the crux of a free market system) they are able to simply hamstring them so their in-house service becomes the better option. That's not free market, that's corporate sabotage.


There is competition in the mobile market because of its nature there are no local monopolies. What about the bigger problem of non-mobile customers? Local monopolies left and right. That was the case well before Title II came along. Municipal ISPs can't pop up because ISPs fight them tooth and nail. Private ISPs can't pop up because ISPs will block them, destroy them, and make it prohibitively expensive. Where is the free market?


They don't need to. First off, nothing is stopping them from remaining 'unaffiliated' and working together on that. Second, all it takes is to disrupt the network to influence and manipulate the price.
@_date: 2017-11-21 20:20:59
ISPs will have full authority to curtail any type of traffic they want. If they so decide, they can kill traffic between nodes of Bitcoin and any other cryptocurrency, and also kill peer discovery.
They don't have a direct and obvious profit motive for doing this, but they can be incentivized. Say someone wants to manipulate the market, they can pay an ISP to fuck with Bitcoin traffic, drive up fees. 
They could demand payment from Coinbase, Kraken, or whatever other currency exchange in return for reliable service.

If it reaches this mark, it will be the de-facto world currency. That's not happening in 5 years, certainly not in it's current form. Bitcoin right now has some major long term &amp; big picture problems to address before it can do that. Also governments haven't even begun to push back. Some won't, but there is zero chance every government is going to happily sit idly by while Bitcoin usurps their control. For bitcoin to hit $1m in 5 years, its rate of growth has to be an order of magnitude faster than what we've seen even in this meteoric year.

Well lets look at the facts:
2014: ISPs hold Netflix, YouTube, and Riot hostage by throttling and demand ransom for delivering their content
2015-2017: In the two years since we've had Title II, the government has not tried to censor or manipulate the internet in any fashion
The ISPs *already* showed disdain for NN and violated it. How on earth are they the lesser risk? Plus, if the government wanted to manipulate/censor the internet, Net Neutrality provisions is not what is going to give them that power.

You just don't want to admit that you can't remember or are ignorant of ISPs throttling big companies and demanding more money from them. That's what led to Title II.
Where is the "free-market self regulation" that prevented this sort of extortion where paying customers were forces to pay extra?
It didn't exist because it's a delusional fantasy that naive libertarians believe in. Honestly... You can put a libertarian on an island out in the pacific with no government or laws, and they'd *still* blame all their life problems on a lack of free market and government regulation.

That's not inflation though. It's inflation if your Bitcoin's worth drops to $1000 because there is a new supply of bitcoins. But that can't happen.
There will be a finite number of bitcoins, and over time many will be lost and unrecoverable. That drives the value of each up, but poses a problem for sustainability. If too many are lost, when then? Imagine a future where 20 of 21 million bitcoins has been lost over time. Then we'll all be scrambling over the last million, which is still plagued by attrition.

Modern socialism is not what you are thinking about. Socialism in modern developed societies is democratic socialism. There is room for free markets.

@_date: 2017-11-22 16:25:14
Net Neutrality is the principle that protects the best free market that we have. That is hardly trivial, and yes, it is the **government** protecting that. I know that bothers the libertarian in you, but it's a truth you just have to swallow.
The simple fact of the matter is that corporations **CANNOT** act ethically because their sole purpose is to make money. They **CANNOT** be trusted to behave ethically, in a pro-consumer, or pro-competition manner. It is simply not possible. So as much you hate any sort of regulation, the government is an effective way of keeping them in check. This is exactly where they need to kept in check.
ISPs created the monopolies they enjoy, and fiercely stamp out any whiff of competition. So while you'll always come to the defense of corporations in thinking that it's wrong for the government to tell ISPs what to do, I think it's wrong for ISPs to tell me how I can use services that I pay for.
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:34:58
The ruling on Net Neutrality? I doubt it.
Losing Net Neutrality means ISPs can interfere with absolutely anything they wish to, cryptos included, but there is no way in hell that they would be able to institute changes so rapidly that anybody holding Bitcoin needs to worry about. Their ruling which is likely going to be in favor of repealing Net Neutrality is also going to be challenged in courts, drawn out, and congress may have to legislate a solution... blah blah blah
Short answer is no because no hard changes will occur immediately.

Loss of Net Neutrality = **anything** can be throttled and censored by your ISP.
That means that traffic between nodes can feasibly be heavily throttled or halted altogether, wreaking havoc on the network (driving up fees?), and connection to the DNS Seed nodes can be severed, hindering node discovery.
There is no limit to how much damage losing Net Neutrality can cause.

There is nothing that ties Title II to lack of investment.


What? He claims investment is down because of Title II. It isn't. How is that attacking the person?


Sometimes people admit things when they shouldn't, but more likely their strategy changed since they said this shortly after Title II was passed. Can I trust them to behave ethically? No. In an anti competitive fashion? Yes. In an anti-consumer fashion? Yes. Same can be said of Ajit Pai.


Except for companies getting throttled and being forced to pay ransom. Did you forget about that? Or ISPs imposing data caps, then zero-rating their own services while hamstringing the competition?

Yeah because the internet was in its infancy, people were on dial-up, and ISPs didn't care about losses from piracy because they didn't have a stake in the game.

Regulation is why people can't sell leeches and miracle elixirs as cures anymore. I can live with that. This is another fallacy I flatly reject. The only reason regulation is perceived to create inefficiency, is because it is usually designed to prohibit profiteering off of extreme unethical behavior or predatory practices. Is it an inefficiency? By some twisted definition, sure. But it's an inefficiency I'm perfectly fine with. Capitalism is not and has never been about being efficient. It is about ruthless profiteering. Society be damned. Nation be damned. People be damned. Ethics be damned.
@_date: 2017-11-21 22:38:01


Correlation does not equal causation. Show me the incontrovertible evidence that lack of investment is because of Title II. Otherwise all you have is conjecture which flies in the face of the admissions of ISPs themselves.


First, we're dealing with a very different, anti-consumer FCC today. I have no faith in a Verizon lawyer to preserve the interests of anyone but Verizon and similar ISPs. Next, Net Neutrality hasn't become such a big issue until streaming services became big, prying Cable TV profits away from cable companies offering those services. 20 years ago was 1997. Net Neutrality was hardly a hot topic then. This shift only happened in recent years and forced them to pay attention to the internet and bandwidth usage because offering good internet service was hurting their other services.


Other than Spectrum, if you signed up for Comcast or AT&amp;T somewhat recently, barring gigabit plans, you probably have been capped. You might be capped now. It's extremely common and hard to get away from. Some ISPs offer unlimited for $50 extra. Not all. Some just want you to eat the overage fee.


Sprint still throttles even on their unlimited plans. Verizon and AT&amp;T's unlimited data plan has a \*drumroll\* data cap!! After which they throttle. Same with Cricket. They will all data cap you, and throttle your speeds when convenient, or in varying ways, but they all do it.

It is reputable. Coinbase is a wallet though. They just make it easy to buy and sell through there, but will charge a lot in fees. Coinbase's exchange is called GDAX. Make a Coinbase account, and you will be able to log into GDAX and buy/sell with much lower fees if you place buy/sell orders.

You have to trust ISPs, because they will hold all the cards, and there is nothing you can do.


Calling names now because you can't handle a dose of reality? Very predictable! I don't need to get out of Bitcoin just yet! Not while there are still useful-idiot libertarians dumping their cash into it and driving up prices for me.

So Bitcoin is easy to lose or steal then...
Bitcoin has also been confiscated by the government. Bitcoin cannot be counterfeit, but you can't counterfeit a chemical element either. It's either Gold, or it isn't.
As for new gold being mined, it's true it is being mined, but there is also a finite supply of it. As more gets mined, the difficulty of producing more increases. This is the same as Bitcoin, except if Bitcoin is lost, passwords forgotten, or it is stolen, then it is gone for good, completely unrecoverable, and that's a major freaking problem that nobody wants to face.
@_date: 2019-04-23 01:01:13
Well newsflash: people are idiots. And bitcoin has been stolen and confiscated time and time over. It happens. If people are involved, it will always be a factor, and no more or less secure than any other commodity. 
And as long as bitcoin remains a niche commodity, it's value will always be limited.
When people dying and taking Bitcoin to the grave with them is really the only thing keeping its value afloat, and even that isn't cutting it. How much Bitcoin has been forever lost?
