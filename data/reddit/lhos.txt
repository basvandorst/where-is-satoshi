This thread is definitely the least triggered group of people I've ever seen.

New dev team? Suddenly aware I may have been living under a rock.

This is what has me most skeptical of LN; it sounds like I'd have a "camp store" account with someone else, where I've paid to have money locked up with them in order to achieve quick transactions. It's very different from how I spend my money now - I don't have x dollars set aside to spend at, say, Target - so the idea of how LN works (as far as I understand it) seems very awkward and not especially useful to me as a consumer.

You could at least be entertaining if you really need a response that badly.

[Maybe try turning on the graph for BTC]( It's pretty cool how the LTC &amp; BCH graphs suddenly flatline.

Wait, are you trolling me?
I'm being serious. This is a serious question.

r/bitcoin is at least 50% r/btc hate and worthless memes.
r/btc is at least 50% r/bitcoin hate and (hopefully?) willful ignorance about how BCH will totally overthrow BTC next week for realz.
Anything that cleans either one up would be a huge step in the right direction.

Your explanation doesn't include enough opinion stated as though it were fact, you need to edit it.

I first came across both r/bitcoin and r/btc a couple months ago.
Neither subreddit manages to completely get over the other, though both have highs and lows. Both make snide remarks about the other and create entire threads to the tune of "hey did you guys hear what the idiots in *that* subreddit are up to today? ^^^so ^^^stupid ^^^amirite " (cue comment circlejerk)
It's like a pair of feuding exes, and has been the single most frustrating part of trying to use either for information or discussion.
For example.




Swap r/bitcoin and r/btc, and you'll find it on r/btc with just as many people agreeing on that "fact".
