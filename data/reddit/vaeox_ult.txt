If the open deposits, I wonder if you'll be able to withdraw.

Just to help put you at ease, there are many many people who had to buy in for the price to go up to $22k. You are far from being alone.

Some currencies such as ETH you can set up smart contracts. And yes by a median there can be a middle man for the trade. Just because someone invented a wheel doesn't mean there's just a single size. If someone doesn't want to sign up for one of those websites, but want a sub they want to communicate in, now there is a place for that. There's tons of sites out there to buy hardware, art, etc. but that doesn't mean there can't be subreddits to do the same.

that is for bitcoins, but if you're wanting to trade other crypto currencies there currently isn't a system

I looked into that and it still is focused around BTC. You can purchase other currencies and sell them, but for BTC according to the video on their site. Also new currencies may be slow to be added. In the sub, you can go straight to buy and selling new currencies.

While I do agree, we are looking to mitigate the possibility of being scammed with different paths.
Trading in person for physical currency would be the safest of course. But others who would want to trade online could either setup a contract, or have a median in place for the trade. Also looking to put in place a local karma system so people can give karma in regards to their interactions with others. Fresh accounts with no karma will not be allowed to post (yes this could be fluffed) but it will help mitigate some spam trades. Many subreddits (especially hardware ones) are setup in a similar manner where as one party must trust the other to ship their products, but since this is all digital, a median will be much easier to have.
