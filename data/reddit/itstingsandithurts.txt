It's not a good idea to compare Bitcoin to shares to newcomers, it creates an air of misinformation. If you want to buy another countries currency you need to go through all that as well, so use that as your comparison.

Although it gets a ton of flak on here Coinbase is probably one of the easier entry points into Bitcoin. It's also the only option I've found as an Australian that both accepts Credit Cards and my state issued photo ID (I don't have a drivers licence), so despite them being my *only* option I have, they have been pretty good.

There's a reason why there is laws against monopolization of certain industries, what sense does it make for one person to have a monopolization over the main channels of communication around Bitcoin?
I'm pretty new to Bitcoin so I don't have a "side" in this, but both sides seem to have decent arguments.

I don't understand why people get hung up on what Satoshi originally proposed for bitcoin. Sure he had a brilliant idea when it came to bitcoin, but does that mean he would have gotten everything right? Bitcoin is meant to evolve for what is best for the people, both miners and users, and maybe his vision of "true btc" wasn't perfect.

Unless you want to do trading you're probably better off getting a hardware wallet and holding your own keys.
Not that CoinBase or Gemini aren't trust worthy, a lot of people use them and don't have many issues with them, you are just in greater control and have a greater security holding your own money.
When you leave your funds in CoinBase or Gemini you are leaving the keys in control of those websites, and while they may never abuse that power, if you are the only one to have the keys to your funds there's *no* chance of losing access to your funds(as long as you don't lose your keys).

Then it's likely just a pending transaction, if a business or someone you don't know does this it's possible for the funds to never come through, you should ask him if he has pending transactions waiting on funds to be received, once those funds are confirmed, yours should be as well.
@_date: 2017-05-15 05:38:52

Yeah, it's been fairly stable the past 3 hours or so, before which was rising? ~~I don't see any big drop.~~ I see a drop now, but it's not really noteworthy, like $5USD in the past 10 minutes, is that what OP is referring to?

Instead of buying $500 today, buy $100(or whatever you want) each week. If it goes down you'll still be able to buy at a lower price, but if it rises you'll still have invested and made money.

This goes against the idea of Bitcoin, in that you end up in control of your own money, but would we likely see forms of "banks" emerge on this kind of system? Centralized nodes that *don't* go offline that a lot of people can make deposits into without fear of the partner going offline?
@_date: 2017-05-15 06:05:17

No one knows for sure, and you're asking the bitcoin subreddit where most people here are confident that it isn't a bubble, but it's impossible to tell for sure.

@_date: 2017-05-16 05:45:40
I only had this explained to me yesterday so I might get this wrong, but you pay a deposit into a multisig account, as to verify you have the funds to make a transfer. Both parties have to sign off on a transfer for it to go through so the other signature holder can't just take the whole deposit and run, however, you can use a "pay Peter to pay Paul" situation, where you and Peter have a shared multisig account with a deposit and Peter and Paul have one as well, so Peter can verify you have the funds to make the transfer, so he himself can sign the multisig to pay Paul, and you pay Peter to make the transfer. Everyone can verify the funds exist, without the need of the chain, but it's still technically trackable through the chain if you followed the "who paid who to pay who" links.
@_date: 2017-05-17 04:54:30
The best advice I was given (I only recently started investing in BTC) was to invest over time.
Put a portion in each week, instead of dumping it all at once. It'll save you the stress of seeing it dip a week after you put it all in, knowing you are buying at a lower price, and it will almost certainly rise eventually.
@_date: 2017-05-31 03:37:16
Why would you want to join a cloudmining operation?
@_date: 2017-05-15 09:07:49
Oh so both parties have a key to the account, so both know that there are funds to make a transfer, but the transfer can't be made without both parties signature? Once both parties sign, they both know the transfer has been made, but the blockchain doesn't update until the 10 minutes (but isn't needed to confirm the transfer?)

What do you mean by 'Better Brand'? Good branding of a product doesn't make it a better product? 
I can agree that the lower fees and faster transactions are a big bonus over Bitcoin, but big money doesn't mean much, there's tons of money in Bitcoin as it is, it doesn't make either a better product. 
I think having the bitcoin name, which is becoming a household name, draws more attraction for businesses to start accepting bitcoin, if I asked the store down the road to accept bitcoin they might consider it seeing as they've seen it on the news a few times, but if I asked them if they would accept ethereum, they'd probably just give me a funny look.
@_date: 2017-05-25 09:25:41
It mainly talked about how much people lost by not investing sooner.
They had a random guy who lost his keys to a wallet that would be worth $44m and talked about the bitcoin the show bought a few years ago at something like $130 and they're planning on giving the profits to charity.
All in all a good segment but not really in depth about what bitcoin is or does.

If lightning networks become the norm before Bitcoin becomes known outside of the crypto-savvy scene as having slow transactions won't that become a non-issue?

Same thing is happening to me, I'm only buying 0.03btc but every time the charge is made it very shortly refunds it and cancels the order. It's been happening about 12 hours now.
I tried 4 or 5 times until it said that I had reach my daily card denial limit and to try again later. I called my bank and they said they didn't have anything happening on their end, no chargebacks, no flags for fraudulent activity or anything so I know it's not on their end. 
@_date: 2017-05-17 04:59:35
Bitcoin has the name to back it though. Anyone first getting into crypto currencies won't buy Ripple or Litecoin first, they'll buy Bitcoin. 
I don't know how much this effects the market, but being the best known crypto has got to make it have more weight on the market, right?

You should always keep whatever coins you aren't using for trading in an offline storage wallet where you control the private keys. There's plenty of tutorials and guides on how to do this if you don't know how.

So say Peter and I have a multisig account, he can verify I have a deposit which can pay him to pay Paul who he has a multisig account with who also can see he has a deposit to finalize the transfer on the blockchain when it updates(with an indefinite amount of nodes inbetween)?

120GB isn't *that* much, especially when even mid range *laptops* are shipping with 1TB+ harddrives, which continues to grow at a pretty crazy pace.

Making it illegal might hurt the market, but it certainly won't get rid of it.
I don't know much about Bitcoin, I'm still fairly new to all this, but the whole idea of Bitcoin is to not have a governing body in control of it, which means even if it was made illegal, it still would be operational, just 
 perhaps harder to transfer Fiat currencies into it.

It's definitely not deterred me from investing in BTC or other altcoins, I don't know too much about what happened though.
I definitely care about the blocksize debate, purely because I'm interested seeing how it effects the market, rather than how it effects my use of bitcoin. I'm investing for the long term gains, not the short term usability.

One guy being a jerk shouldn't stop you from recommending services that you've personally had a good experience with to others. I haven't had any issues with coinbase, slow withdrawals sometimes but nothing that you wouldn't find with other exchanges during the same peak traffic times.
Coinbase is probably the most accessible to those outside of the U.S. as well, as an Australian there's next to no other services that I can use that will accept a credit/debit card, the next best has a 3 day waiting period on bank transfers.

BitcoinCash is almost definitely going to be a split from Bitcoin, which is primarily what Coinbase is protecting it's users from. However this split is a relative non-threat to Bitcoin itself, unless *a lot* of users jump ship from Bitcoin onto BitcoinCash (highly unlikely IMO) it will go almost unnoticed.
If you have Bitcoins on Coinbase and want to ensure you don't lose out on holding BitcoinCash as well when the split occurs, withdraw your Bitcoins before July 31st, as Coinbase will not be trading BitcoinCash and any BitcoinCash you would have gained from the split will be forfeit to Coinbase.
@_date: 2017-07-31 23:19:25
where they will shit on coinbase any chance they get. 
Everyone knows coinbase is unreliable and shitty, but it's most peoples entry point into crypto and a lot of peoples *only* option for buying bitcoin, not to mention it isn't an exchange for trading like kraken or polo or others, so to call out coinbase on a kraken thread makes no sense.

@_date: 2017-07-31 23:15:40
Not trying to be a dick, but people say around here *all the time* not to keep your coins on exchanges or other services. One of the main points of bitcoin is to be control of your money, and leaving it on somewhere like btc-e, or even coinbase or other reputable exchanges is the exact opposite of being in control.
It sucks that you lost money, but hopefully people can learn from mistakes like yours and not do the same thing themselves.
@_date: 2017-07-30 08:35:46
I wasn't calling people out on *not* withdrawing, if you don't care about the fork and are happy leaving your coins in coinbase, thats your prerogative, but the people complaining about the slow withdrawals when they left it to the very last minute to get their coins out doesn't make sense.
It's the people who *do* care about their coins, but aren't bothered enough to do it before it's too late and are now complaining about it are who I'm calling out.
Also, "nerdy bullshit wallets" are far more secure than any other way of storing your coins, there's plenty of easy options for storing your coins but only if you aren't worried about the service you use liquidating, or having assets seized by the government like btc-e recently. 
@_date: 2017-07-30 13:01:03

It's a new coin but Iota seems like the kind of tech I expect to come out on top. No idea if Iota will actually succeed but with "The Tangle", a decentralized form of mining, where each node confirms a transaction when it makes a transaction, making transactions free, I hope to see Iota, or a similar coin using similar tech, to come out on top.
I believe having a truly decentralized, peer-to-peer network is the only way forward.
