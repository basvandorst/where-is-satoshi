Looks like the only thing being posted there is are links to a promotional Twitter account. It's a dumb way to participate on Reddit.

I loathe Ver. I can't even listen to this interview because it gets my blood pressure up. Something about the guy just makes my stomach turn so as a result I couldn't make it to the quote that this thread is about...insider trading being a non crime. I agree.
Everyone whining about insider trading is being a major wuss. Want to go crying to the SEC about it? Go for it. Sure let's bring the regulators in even deeper because someone beat you to your precious gains that you assume you think you're entitled to.
I was watching that buy wall on Gdax just like everyone else. It was going to spike and trip the circuit breakers with or without insiders. They made no difference.

This is my understanding as well. I plan to claim the BCH as income at the price it was at when I redeemed it. 
In a similar vein, I have not redeemed my btg. I tried but the split tool didn't work so I have no access to them and can't say how many I'd be entitled to, so I won't claim btg as income until till I actually have access to them. Once I do I'll record the current price and claim the entire amount as income or capital gain, whichever definition it fits.

My guess is that it would have prematurely altered the trading dynamics to issue a PR in advance. They treated this much more like a traditional PR coming from a publicly traded company, hush hush until the word hits the street so that no one can trade early on the info. I think Coinbase did the right thing here by springing it on people. But there seems to be an obvious technical problem.

There was a buy wall of over 3K BCH when trading started. It was obviously going to spike when the switch was thrown, which was within an hour of when the announcement went out. Didn't take any inside knowledge to see what was going to happen.
I'm not saying they didn't tell their friends. I have no idea. But all the order matching engines I've seen in the last year perform this same way when bid orders stack up like that.

If someone asked me today, how should I invest 1 billion dollars in bitcoin, I'd say to put 100 million into coins, and spend the other 900 million on bitcoin infrastructure, network resilience, lobbying, and most importantly education. Investing in Andreas is an investment that pays the network.

I feel like you have nothing to worry about. The fundamentals in bitcoin have never ever been stronger. Every day there is a new technological innovation, whether it's privacy, transaction efficiency, second layers being launched, or large institutions planning to enter the space. This isn't bear market, it's an intermission. If you have a job and can pay your bills, don't sell your BTC.
@_date: 2019-06-16 14:17:32
This is a totally valid thesis, and you aren't alone in thinking it. I'm personally betting on BTC absorbing a significant share of the real-estate-as-store-of-value market.

At current difficulty, running a single Dragonmint T1 (faster than an S9), and mining on a large pool like Slush, you'll average a little over 50,000 sats a day. So using round numbers....
100,000 sats/.001 BTC every 2 days
1,000,000 sats/.01 BTC every 20 days
10,000,000 sats/.1 BTC every 200 days
100,000,000 sats/1 BTC every 2000 days
I'm currently paying about 11 cents/kWh and using 35 kWh/day. So that's $3.85 per day.
$3.85 x 2000 = $7,700.00 BTC breakeven price
The math on all this will, of course, change drastically in 2000 days and not in your favor.
But mining is still fun to do as a hobby and it REALLY helps you understand and appreciate the incredible mechanism that is Proof Of Work. All you have to do to participate in the security of the Bitcoin network is pay for electricity and run a miner. You don't need an ID, or anyone's permission. And you will likely be profitable at current prices. You'll find it mind-blowing and elegant how bitcoin harnesses open source software, selfish financial incentives, and trustless cooperation among total strangers who are geographically dispersed across the globe to maintain it's clock-like emission schedule. 
It will also illustrate in a very real way why pre-mined, non proof of work based, central treasury controlled shitcoins like Stellar (and many others) are just apps; toys that offer finance as a form of entertainment, with an endless array of "features", but none of the sound money properties, and the unforgeable costliness of Bitcoin.  
By all means get a miner and start mining.

Important question. There's enough renewable energy to power all of our mining operations and drive our cars and run our homes. The transition away from fossil fuels should happen Asap and given the fact that solar energy is now the cheapest form of energy on the planet, and also given that Bitcoin mining provides a direct economic incentive to pay as little as possible for power, the two could be part of a virtuous cycle of adoption.

Replace "will" with "may"
Replace "is" with "might be"

I'm reading Mastering Bitcoin now and part of the Core's node discovery protocol includes DNS seeds. 
"The Bitcoin Core client contains the names of five different DNS seeds. The diversity of ownership and diversity of implementation of the different DNS seeds offers a high level of reliability for the initial bootstrapping process."
Since these seeds are public, could an ISP monitor these IPs and block all inbound and outbound traffic from them?

No requerement to join a pool. Just sign up with any old email address, then create a worker ID (or several).
Yes including the cost of the miner it's hard to be truly profitable. It's all about hash rate. You want to be doing more hashes than everyone else with the same amount of electricity. The faster asics make more sats, but cost more too.
Personally I don't consider today's prices. In my mind I'm planning on $100k/BTC minimum, in which case every 10 Satoshis is a penny. And 50K satoshis is 50 dollars. That's where I think we're headed.
However the fact remains that financially you'll do better simply buying those satoshis on the market. 
It's all about what your priorities are and what kind of learning experience is worth it and at what cost.

He's the most knowledgeable dilettante I've ever heard speak on a subject. He does himself the greatest disservice of all by failing to represent the few good arguments that actually exist for bitcoin cash. I'm not going to offer those arguments here because I'm not a fan of that project but I will acknowledge that it has value which he cannot articulate and perhaps does not even see.

I appreciate where this is all coming from. I personally only keep the bare minimum on exchanges. But any plan for everyone to do it all the same day is fraught with peril, and unseen complications. 
Again, I love the public service message that this sends. But only undertake full custody of your coins when you feel ready to handle it responsibly without losing the keys. And if you're not in a hurry just wait till transaction fees are low and only transfer small amounts at a time.
No sudden moves people.
