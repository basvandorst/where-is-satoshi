bitquick.io looks promising, has anyone here used that?

Is buying local bitcoins a safe endeavor though? I feel like it's kinda like a drug deal or something and am afraid to get scammed, is their a way to find out if the seller is reputable?

No I meant buying local bitcoins, from a person. I'm assuming that's what you were referring to, I'll check out purse.io

No from my understanding that's why Gemini denied the transfer, not my credit union. My credit union had no problem wiring the money for me.

My title was misleading, Gemini denied the transaction, unless I misunderstood the guy at my Credit Union said when he called. It sounded to me like he implied they tried to wire the money and Gemini denied it under "Risk Management".

I can't do ACH until my bank account gets verified, and can't get it verified until I wire them some money from it. Which I did, and they denied it..

I just emailed Gemini and they said "send me a screenshot or error code" I'm like there is no screenshot I went into my CU and manually wired it as my CU isn't on their list of banks that can do it from their website. I was wiring them $100 just to link my account with them. Should I have not sent as much money at first?

Yeah I never found any reason to buy altcoins aside from Monero and Litecoin, which at this point obviously aren't shitcoins.

So I CAN use one, I just might get banned randomly for doing so. Hrmph..
