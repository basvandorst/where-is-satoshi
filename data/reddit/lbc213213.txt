First time I actually heard about bitcoin was from silk road, maybe like 2011 or so but I just thought it was a way to get around international laws/send money without legal issues like paypal etc (even though it is kinda true now) . I found it properly first last year though from an investment point of view since proper stock/commodity exchanges started trading on it, price was around $800. Tried to convince parents etc to let me borrow money so I could invest. My theory was that it would definitely double over the year (100%) at least ( in 2017) since it had been performing well doubling every year since or better. I had no money, they didn't believe in it,  can't really blame them, fast forward now its gone up over 1000%. I'm depressed seeing how far its gone up but happy at the same time. Not sure if I'd ever be able to afford some or part of a coin once I start work but since it's becoming so mainstream now it's bit exciting to see how crypto will do in the future. It's like the dot com era. Some will "moon", others will collapse I guess.

Almost bought waltcoin,  still might consider it then sell soon as it doubles lol. I don’t know if I would consider it shitty but there’s so many it’s hard to keep up with all the details etc

Nice. I will hopefully be entering soon. Like everyone I should have bought much sooner! I remember reading about bitcoin first on 4chan just last year and almost persuaded my parents to loan me money (was in college) to buy some when it was under $1k. Oh well...

But that was Greece’s fault to be honest without sounding harsh. They borrowed and spent a lot of money without being able to afford paying it back. It had nothing to do with the currency itself.
