If I'm not mistaken it takes 100 confirmations to complete

I make a bet that in 30 days the price of Bitcoin will be 19K.  If the price is actually higher than 19K, say 20K, then I get paid 1K in fiat.  If the price is actually lower, say 18K, I pay out 1K in fiat.  No actual exchange of any bitcoin, it is all cash bets on the future price.

I think if he goes through the full ID verification (upload a driver's license, etc) his limit will increase

Futures contracts actually don't affect bitcoin supply at all since they are all side bets settled for cash not bitcoin.  In addition to offering futures contracts these firms would also have to purchase a bunch of Bitcoin to drive the price up short term to sell and screw the long contracts later.  Doesnt make a lot of sense logistically in my opinion.

Well it will be somewhere around year 2140 before all 21m are mined, but regardless of that the quantity is fixed which means there is scarcity.  You can't just decide to "print" more bitcoin as the US does with dollars so as long as there is demand there will.be increasing prices.  I imagine the price increase will in effect stop once we don't use dollars to measure the worth of a bitcoin and just use bitcoin day to day.

There is a lot of confusion right now in this sub on these topics.  A lot of people seem to think that Wallstreet is propping the price of bitcoin up before the futures launch to cash out and dump the price, but considering that futures contracts are all side bets related to price and not the actual exchange on bitcoin it doesn't make much sense.

Ok, you've sparked my interest..  How do I buy Bitcoin on bitstamp and get it to coinbase in time to sell for the premium quickly?  
@_date: 2017-12-09 22:36:10
Why not? Simple supply and demand.  As long as people are willing to pay for it the price will continue to rise, especially as it becomes more mainstream.

This is really how you short bitcoin, not what futures contracts are.  Futures contracts don't have anything to do with transfer of bitcoin, they are cash only transactions.

Thanks, Yoda. Looking forward to your next riddle.

it is normal to have a delay.  Backlog in the mempool...

relax, no need to worry if all you did was send BTC from your wallet to gdax.  An "unspent" transaction means your BTC is sitting in your original wallet waiting to be transferred.  "Spent" means that the transfer is in progress and you will now wait for your transaction to be confirmed (logged in the blockchain and visible in dgax).

You should have 4.4 BTC and 4.4 BCH

To short bitcoin you would need to borrow BTC from someone now and sell it for fiat.  Then when the price drops you buy BTC again and return it to the person you borrowed it from and pocket the profits.  Futures contracts are side bets settled with cash only, not bitcoin, so I can't see how futures have anything to do with shorting.  
@_date: 2017-12-24 04:39:24
That makes sense, thanks

The majority of supporters and folks in this sub don't believe Bitcoin is in a bubble.

Just to clarify a little, a "normal" futures contract would result in the exchange of an asset.  Airlines do this with fuel.  If I am American Airlines, let's say, I can make a contract to purchase fuel one year from now below what I think the market price will be.  I am locked in  to that price even in the fuel price tanks for some reason.  Since airlines purchase so much fuel each year it is a way to mitigate some financial risk (if their bet pays off).  With the bitcoin futures the contracting parties just agree to settle with the cash difference instead of handing bitcoin back and forth (as per the CBOE and CME guidelines for this specific futures market).

It'll go through eventually.  I did an exchange with Changelly a few weeks ago that took 6 days.  If.you search you will see many people in the same boat as you, I won't ever use them again...

I think he is asking if the price can go so low that you owe money.
@_date: 2017-12-24 04:09:46
The amount of time it takes to send Bitcoin between exchanges basically ruins anyone's arbitrage ability.

The network is very busy, it took me almost 8 hours to get a transfer through last night...
