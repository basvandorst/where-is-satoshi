I 100% agree with you. China publicly announcing the huge potential in Blockchain, as well as Bakkt, hosting a platform that allows legit corporations to hop in the way they're accustomed to. All the signs are there. Lightning is going to change the way payment processing is handled by the masses. Every mobile device becomes a Point-of-Sale(POS) system with lightning/blockchain technology. I believe this decade we will witness a major shift towards Blockchain-based tech.

Block 11 will begin selling pre-configured nodes in February 2020. We also integrate commercial companies online marketplace to process crypto payments via lightning. So, to answer your question, IM SPREADING LN, not just participating.

Banks have stopped allowing users to purchase via credit card because they classify crypto as a 'risky' purchase. BUT they allow people to blow through their credit limit on designer clothing and unnecessary items. I tell people to go buy a dollar.....you can't. The majority of Americans don't have liquid cash available to invest in things like this. This is just one tactic they're using to deny access to the average American.

I've had two different contractors request Bitcoin as a form of payment this year. I'm sure that number will climb in 2020

Looks like they are a knockoff of Block 11

I'll be sure to reach out when we surpass $4 Billion....but I highly doubt at that point I'll have to tell you. You'll know....and feel really dumb for questioning Block 11 and the progress it brings to the industry.

We are currently looking into this integration feature at Block 11.

I love supporting the tech. Can't wait to see what Lightning Network becomes, I have very high hopes for the LN.
