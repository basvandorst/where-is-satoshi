Bitcoin is going to be attacked in every way possible and it's up to Bitcoin to be resilient to that. Even if Coinbase fixes this issue, what's stopping any of the worlds government's from spending a few billion dollars spamming high-fee transactions?
@_date: 2018-01-07 19:52:55
Not to mention that the developers themselves describe it as an experiment. They have no idea if it's actually going to work in the wild.
@_date: 2018-01-12 17:57:16
So do we blame you for being a bad actor on the internet, or do we blame the technology for not being resilient to attacks?
@_date: 2018-01-07 19:58:10
It's a 1.7x increase in the number of transactions that can be included in a block with a 4x increase in the block size.

They said LN was 6 months away over 2 years ago. People are losing faith in it.
@_date: 2018-01-12 18:32:51
That's not what I meant at all. The attack vector has nothing to do with LN nodes. LN is optional, and no one has to use it if they don't want to. A bad actor can spam the BTC mempool with hi-fee transactions, thus making it incredibly costly to create or destroy LN channels.
As an example, right now there's around 300,000 transactions per day on the BTC network (rounded up a little bit). A government or bank could easily spend 30 million dollars and clog the entire network up with transaction fees at $100. This is an incredibly tiny amount for a government, or a bank. In reality it wouldn't take 300,000 transactions to perform this attack. Something like 30,000 transactions would probably be enough to push the fees up significantly.
That means a LN channel will cost $100+ to open, and another $100+ to close. I don't know many use cases where people will be willing to burn $200+ to move money around.
@_date: 2018-01-12 17:53:30
Ultimately bitcoin needs to be resilient to every possible bad actor. This really isn't about Coinbase, it's about a flaw in the technology. Even if Coinbase fixes the issue and implements Segwit, nothing is stopping a Government from doing the same thing on a much larger scale. If bitcoin can be taken down by a single company, it's bitcoins fault.
@_date: 2018-01-12 18:02:46
LN won't remove the spam transaction attack though... Since you still have to pay BTC transaction fees to open and close channels, spam transactions can still make LN unusable.

Honest question - I thought the bitcoin protocol was supposed to be able to handle attacks. If all it takes is one company to bring the entire network to it's knees, doesn't that mean something is wrong with the protocol?
@_date: 2018-01-12 18:06:25
LN will help, but it won't remove the spam-transaction attack vector though... since it still requires BTC transaction fees to open and close channels. Any third party is still free to spend as much money as they want spamming. If a government wanted to take out bitcoin, this would be the easiest way for them to do that.
@_date: 2018-01-08 14:25:10
Huh? What other sub.
Are you saying that people don't normally talk about facts here?
@_date: 2018-01-12 18:21:41
That's not what I meant. They can flood the BTC mempool with hi-fee transactions, making it incredibly expensive to create and destroy LN channels.
@_date: 2018-01-12 18:00:03
It's not really about Coinbase though. If the technology can be taken down by a single bad actor, then the technology has a problem. Even if Coinbase implements batching and segwit today, nothing is stopping a large government from completely taking down the network.
@_date: 2018-01-04 15:56:42
There's a few problems with this though. For starters, most people don't know what to do with themselves if they don't have someone telling them what to do.
The second is... if you try to throw the rich off a cliff, you have to get through all the people that they are paying to stop you.
@_date: 2018-01-12 18:39:47
Almost everyone I know lives paycheck to paycheck... if the goal is to allow them to adopt bitcoin than you have to find a way to include people that don't have the ability to dump a year's worth of expenses into a LN channel up front.
I also disagree with you about how much it would take the spam the network. A large bank can easily afford to spend 3 million a day on spam transactions, and that would likely be enough to exacerbate the problem and make BTC almost unusable.

The entire BTC-BCH drama is what he's talking about. It makes no sense at all. If one crypto does well it's a huge win for all crypto. Who cares which one it is? At the end of the day we will try dozens of scaling solutions, and not all of them will work. But it's good that we are trying them all to experiment and see which ones do work.

Well, for someone to move 2 BTC through your hun you need to have 2 BTC deposited in it. Naturally, this will lead to a few really large central hubs that everyone connects to and they will be soaking up the fees.

LN needs a block size of 133mb to allow global use of it once a year anyway.
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:25:00

I feel like the community in general should move there.
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:16:09
You can open a connection to one other point that allows 0.1 BTC to flow through it.
Say you want to pay steve, so you open a connection to him for 0.1 btc. You pay the BTC fees and now you have a channel where 0.1 can freely go between you and steve.
Later you open a connection to Starbucks and use it to pay them with another 0.1 btc. This also costs the normal BTC fees to open.
Steve can now send up to 0.1 BTC to Starbucks through your connection, paying you a tiny fee.
Naturally this will lead to a few central hubs that everyone wants to connect through because they have 100s or 1000s of BTCs of capacity, and they eat up the LN fees.
Eventually I think their goal is that 100% of BTC goes through LN, which makes their private corporation a bunch in profits.
@_date: 2017-12-26 17:37:25
Right, but all of this only seems to work if the cost to broadcast the transaction is lower than what you would gain by broadcasting it. Although I suppose in the case you mentioned, an attacker would have to pay the same fees to broadcast an older state... so it's unlikely they would do that unless there was a lot more money at stake and they thought they could get away with it.

Bitcoin will require a hard fork to increase the blocksize before LN will be able to scale to any meaningful levels. Until that hard fork is announced there really isn't any reason to be worried about missing out.
With 1mb block size, LN is expected to process 100k transactions per day, which means it would actually process fewer transactions that BTC already does today.
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:39:55

@_date: 2017-12-26 15:55:11
tldr: I had some numbers wrong. LN could possible see a 25% increase using 1MB blocksizes. It's highly likely a hard fork is still required.
Ahh good catch, there's some issues with the units. Let me also pull real world figures instead of using my memory.
Right now it says BTC processed 230,548 transactions in the past 24 hours.
The LN white paper says 105,000,000 per year. That comes out to roughly 287,671 per day. That's roughly a 25% increase, assuming the white paper numbers are accurate.
There might also be some changes to these numbers with increased segwit adoption. I think most sources say the segwit 4Mb increase would give a 1.7x transaction rate. So we might see a small boost to transactions with LN right now. Nothing on the orders of magnitude scaling that we are going to need.
@_date: 2017-12-27 16:28:34
It literally does not matter which coin is "the real bitcoin". This is just some made up fantasy argument that people use to distract from actual issues and discussions. It doesn't help either coin.

You would have to preload $1000 or more. At that level a couple $30 fee is close to what a debit card processor would charge. You would have to be really committed to drinking a lot of coffee, and also be wealthy enough to afford it.
In any case BTC is going to require a hard fork to increase the block size before LN is going to be usable or provide any scaling benefits.
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:10:01
But LN requires block size increase to work anyway. The current BTC network can't handle LN without a hardfork.
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:40:19
Satoshis plan was always to increase block size. It was the last thing he talked about before he disappeared.
There have been tests with 1gb block sizes that worked perfectly fine. Not that we need them to be that large today, but it would be possible when it is necessary.
1mb is tiny. It's like floppy disc technology from 30 years ago. If you just look at moores law scaling from when the 1mb limit was added, we'd be well above 8mb now.
The 1mb limit was added only to stop spam transactions when there was no monetary cost to mining blocks. Today we have massive monetary incentives to prevent miners from doing that.

I'm still trying to understand Lightning Network and get my head around weather or not I think it will actually work.
I think it's important that we try to scale with larger blocks, and we also try to scale with side-chains and directed payment channels. If we try something and it fails, that's awesome. We will learn from it and try something else knowing more than we did before. I think the real solution will be a combination of things.

You have to make a BTC transaction to create a LM channel or to close one. The transactions are only free inside those channels. The current network will see no benefit from LN because everyone still has to pay super high fees to get money in or out of LN.
The white paper States clearly that the block size would have to be 133mb to allow everyone in the world to open and close 1 channel each year.

I misunderstood. Contracts are created with time limits, not channels.
There is still the issue of bad or unresponsive actors that would force a channel to be terminated.


I'm still not sure what happens when the cost to broadcast the transaction occurs a higher cost than what you would gain. This still feels like its a huge attack vector, and if you know anything about bitcoin its that people love to attack it in every way possible.

From what I've researched no one has figured out how the routing algorithm is even going to work between multiple nodes... And to be honest its sounds like it's going to be a NP (mathematics term) problem which means it cannot be solved in polynomial time. Similar to the traveling salesman problem.

LN cannot scale Bitcoin without increasing the blocksize. The current Bitcoin network cannot handle LN without a hard fork. 
For everyone in the world to create one LN channel and close one channel every year the block size would need to be 133mb.

I'm not sure why you think I'm shilling some agenda... this information is directly pulled from the Lightning Network white paper.
Here is a direct quote from the scaling section of that paper.
Note that it says with 1MB block sizes LN would be able to support 35 million users with 3 transactions each. That's 105 million transactions, which is less than what BTC already handles today.
If there is something I am missing feel free to let me know.


make 3 blockchain transactions per year on average, Bitcoin will be able
to support over 35 million users with 1MB blocks in ideal circumstances
(assuming 2000 transactions/MB, or 500 bytes/Tx). This is quite limited,
and an increase of the block size may be necessary to support everyone in
the world using Bitcoin. A simple increase of the block size would be a hard
fork, meaning all nodes will need to update their wallets if they wish to
participate in the network with the larger blocks.

They likely won't do that because it's the high fees that make LN profitable and necessary to begin with.
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:52:08
To make any real profits you'll need a massive amount of BTC and you will have to set up a large LN hub and get a bunch of people to connect to. You still have to pay the BTC fees to lock up your coins in a lightning checking account, and then pay fees again to remove them.
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:16:40
Thanks for replying.
Everyone pushing LN has been super critical of even super tiny blocksize increases. When I said that the current network (1mb block limit) will see no benefit I mean that it won't be enough to clear the mempool and bring transaction fees back down to 0.
The numbers I used were pulled directly from the lightning network white paper.

It's a block chain transaction to move money into LN or move money out. Those fees go to BTC miners, just like every other BTC transaction. You can move money around LN channels, but only up to the amount that was locked up in those channels when they were opened.
@_date: 2017-12-21 23:16:02
Also, Coinbase is FDIC insured.
@_date: 2017-12-26 13:51:57
It wouldn't be very useful right now. You would have to pay the transaction fees twice to open and close the channel, and that would only make the current scaling issues worse.
@_date: 2017-12-26 14:30:36
It doesn't really matter how many lightning networks you have... you have to broadcast a transaction on the BTC blockchain to open or close a LN channel. All the funds you want to spend have to be locked up at the time the channel is created.
So if you wanted to buy coffee from Starbucks you would open a channel with them and lock away some amount of money, and over time you can slowly spend that money. The fees to create and close that channel are dependent on the BTC transaction fees, so it would cost $60 just to open and close the channel. You'd have to lock up a LOT of money for it to be worth it.
Also, if there is a bad actor in the transaction chain the only way to force them to pay up is to broadcast the transaction and close the LN channel. I don't really understand what happens in the case where the fees to broadcast that transaction are higher than the money they are trying to steal...
@_date: 2017-12-26 15:08:25
Your response makes it sound like you haven't read the Lightning Network white paper and haven't done any work to inform yourself on how the protocol works.
A transaction can go through multiple hubs before it reaches its destination. Any one of those hubs can decide to not pay the next person down the line. For a hub that did not get paid it's only recourse is to forcibly close the lightning channel with that hub by broadcasting the entire transaction on the blockchain.
What happens when the fee to broadcast that transaction on the blockchain cost the hub more money than it would gain?
@_date: 2017-12-17 21:09:22
Ahh yeah. Some people claim 0 on their W2 for the same reasons. It causes the US government to take less out of each paycheck but you also owe more at the end of the year. It's sorta like an interest free loan to the government of you let them take out more.

@_date: 2017-12-26 16:35:33
Right, so the clarification is that LN would support and infinite number of transactions for 35 million users, as long as...
* There are only 35 million users.
* No other on-chain transactions occur. This means every BTC user, wallet, exchange, merchant, etc. has adopted LN.
* Each user only does 3 on-chain transactions each year: Presumably acquiring BTC, creating a channel, and closing a channel.
* Everyone has enough money at the start of the year to lock into LN for the entire year, and never has to add more funds mid-year.
* No channels are force-closed by either bad actors or timeouts.
If any of these assumptions is false it would limit users entering into the LN network.
@_date: 2017-12-26 18:53:21
Interesting. How would that work? Wouldn't the exchange have to create a channel for you still?
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:31:08
LN is only going to increase BTC transactions though, because you have to transact to lock funds away in the LN checking account and transact again to remove the funds... So a single transaction now takes twice as much space. I don't see how that fixes anything.

Bitcoin currently supports somewhere between 100 million and 125 million transactions per year. Lightning network can support 35 million users, each using 3 transactions. 35 * 3 = 105 million transactions per year. So adding lightning network right now without a hard fork would do nothing to help the transaction rate, according to the white paper.

Channels are created with specific time limits, so its not indefinitely. Pretty much everyone I know lives paycheck to paycheck, so asking them to lock away even a months worth of money is a huge deal. Eventually if they got paid through LN this wouldn't be as big of an issue... but that's a long ways off still.
If there is a bad actor in the transaction path, the only resolution is to close the channel out. If everyone is acting in good faith this won't happen, but it's definitely an attack vector on LN. I'm not sure what happens if the fee to broadcast the transaction is higher than the value of the transaction. It seems to me that LN would only be able to reliably support transactions that were significantly higher than the fees, because you would be risking a bad actor stealing value from you with no recourse.
The white paper says that LN can handle 35 million users with a 1MB block limit. 35 million is a very small number here. To scale beyond that would require a block size increase. Those numbers are assuming that channels stay open for a long time.

Is this a joke? I have to give up my private keys to use LN?

Didn't block stream get like 74 million in funding?
Edit: spelling

I don't see why there has to be religious wars over it. I'm investing in both Bsegwit and Bcash. Time will show which has the better technology stack. Outside of that I'm agnostic.

Sure, but isn't this what needs to happen for it to go mainstream?

Hardware or paper wallet.

You know what else would have done that? Doubling the block size. Except that would have been a super easy upgrade and already solved the fee problem.

Should have picked LTC. It's up like 4x in the same time period.

Reddit rules require less than 10% of any users content can be self promotion.

If it drops then I'll just buy a little more. If it ever reaches $5k again than its still worth it, and I'm just throwing in a few thousand here and there so it's not a huge deal if I lose it. But in the case where it does really well then I'm ready to be pleasantly surprised.

I disagree. Spending money on science almost always leads to benefits for society. Maybe landing on the moon didn't do a ton itself, but the advancements in satellites and other related technology have directly impacted almost everyone in the world.

-Trades should usually not be advertised here. For example, submissions like "Buying 100 BTC" or "Selling my computer for bitcoins" do not belong here. is primarily for news and discussion.
@_date: 2017-10-20 15:22:51
No, are you? This post is entirely someone posting about a trade they made. There is no news or discussion at all. I don't understand why the community would be so upset about trying to enforce the rules they everyone already agreed upon.
@_date: 2017-10-07 01:23:46
What the hell man. Why would you ruin the ending for me? I don't even want to watch anymore now.

Yeah, but does he still have to split the money if the bitcoins get "stolen" into another wallet?
@_date: 2017-10-06 23:32:36
There is no such thing as intrinsic value. Even bitcoin has no intrinsic value. People give things value based on what they think it should be worth, and when you have enough people involved in trading it you get a market. It's all based on faith.
@_date: 2017-10-20 15:35:11
He's literally saying "Hey, look at this trade I made!" How is that anything but advertising a trade? There is no news value or discussion value, and that is exactly what the rule says not to do.

This isn't even it's final form yet.

This is directly against the rules of the sub Reddit tho.
