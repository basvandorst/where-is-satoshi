Am I reading right you are using ASIC erupters? Those can't mine scrypt.

Why would you prefer your debit card?  If you pay off your credit card immediately at the end of every month it's a free loan.

Some debit cards also do rewards so I didn't think it was fair to use it as an argument.

The war against drugs has destroyed more lives than drug use alone ever could have hoped to achieve.

eBay is constantly playing whack a mole with people's btc listings though, they are not a fan of btc related sales either.

Or a normal hard drive for that matter.  Why do people think this is a thing?  Yeah it could wreck your 1.44 floppies.  It's not going to harm a hard drive that's encased in a metal box.

If you max out the fans it's fine.  Noisy though.

Make sure the hot air exiting the cards has somewhere to go.  In addition to the vents on the PCI slot covers there is a vent that blows inside the case.  This will cause the hot air to be re-ingested if there isn't a way for it to get out.

A little careful overclocking will get you to 950.

The CC statements should have the same level of detail.
Also if a CC is compromised you're not out the money.  With the debit card that's your real money that's tied up during the investigation.

Using your botnet for this purpose comes at a high opportunity cost. There is more money to be made renting it out for spam and DDOS attacks.
Edit: the GPU in most consumer non-enthusiast machines is junk. And people will notice when their GPU fan is running full tilt and get the computer looked at and de-botnetted. Successful botnet software can't be too hardware intensive.
