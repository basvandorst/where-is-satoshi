yes but now they can buy bitcoin at a lower price!

Thank you! Yeah, it is unfortunate too.. was hoping this tied the community together in a better way.

Depends on the market value of the fart in question.

Great question, I have an engine in place that currently converts all coins to bitcoin and then $USD almost immediately if I want it to. Currently I have no need to convert much of the coins, so I'm just holding them. But if someone were to buy 10,000$ worth of stuff, then I would do the conversion on the fly so I can ship these products out and to their door in 4 days flat. 
TL;DR - I am taking on risk right now because I believe the coins will do good, but once I reach my risk cap, I will convert coins to USD almost immediately with the built engine.

Over the past few weeks I have been silently working on a marketplace that was initially dogecoin inspired. I wanted to build a simple and efficient shop where you could go, search what you wanted, and get what you came looking for. During about mid-phase of development, I decided that I should do what has never been done before. I should open up a marketplace that accepts all major cryptocurrency's! We currently support Bitcoin, Litecoin, Dogecoin, Namecoin, Peercoin, Quark, Worldcoin and Primecoin but I am looking to implement as many as I can to accommodate those looking to convert their coins for items in our shop.
I introduce to you: 
I would love any and all feedback, I am really working hard to make this a reality! Thank you in advance and I will be here to answer all questions. Thank you everyone!
Shoutout to for helping me with some incredible artwork. You always came through for me when I needed it!

to be fair, not a single one portfolio app does what i need it to do. some are good for some things, others are good for other things. we'll get there eventually i hope...

Are there advantages to ethereum that bitcoin doesn't have? All I know is that it was hacked not long ago lol
@_date: 2017-05-30 14:46:01
Hm, so what could stop Ethereum from becoming a useless coin? Or on the flip side, what could stop it from overtaking bitcoin in the future if it offers more advantages over bitcoin? Genuinely curious.

RIP lol

How much is that even worth? Is that a lot? Is that a little?
@_date: 2017-05-30 15:08:37
Thank you for your response! Is the security behind ethereum considered to be much worse because of that? I feel like there are a lot of faults with each of these coins, but I'm surprised someone hasn't tailored a coin based on all the things people actually want. Would it not be possible to take all the advantages of all the different kinds of coins and generate something like that?
@_date: 2017-05-30 14:42:35
So just so I understand, he is an owner of a company that mines bitcoins, and has developed some advantage to mine more coins than other miners, thus wants to keep the way things are for his own financial gain? 
@_date: 2017-05-28 02:49:27
Much wow, such sad. :( 
@_date: 2017-05-31 15:02:37
lol i hear that about every coin ever. bitcoin was overprice at 100, then at 500, then at 1000.

As dumbed down, concise, and forward as you can. While I might know more than the average, a lot of people, especially the new comers don't. This reads really well, only thing I can think of is just outright saying If this then That kind of setting where people can understand that if X occurs, they can look for Y to happen as well.
