I disagree.  Never is a long time.  I think the killer app will be one where you will be able to hold many different currencies on a smartphone and you will be able to convert between any currency you want, almost instantly, for little to no fees.

Sure, people that have been around bitcoin for a little while.  People completely new to bitcoin have a hard time understanding it at first.  Once they do understand, they don't want just a fraction of a coin.

You can if you are willing to take the risk.  Even if you have to charge a 50% markup to account for the fraud.  I do agree though that the business would not last very long because the amount of markup required would get out of control and the owners would either get out while they were in the green or end up in court.

Great point.  One problem I see with people new to bitcoin is that they don't want 0.00032145 bitcoins.  That has a psychological effect.  It takes a while to explain to people that you don't have to have one whole bitcoin at a time.

Aw, cmon let people speculate, panic, and go crazy.  This is Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-08-08 03:22:39
One way I like to explain it to people is comparing it to email.  
Using a CC online is a pull transaction.  In other words you give them all of your private information for them to basically get into your account and pull the funds.  If email was used like a CC, you would give someone your email address and password so they could log into your email account to send an email from you to themselves.  Then this data is sometimes stored in plain text(could be wrong here) on servers for years.
With Bitcoin whoever you are paying gives your their public account number (bitcoin address) and you push the funds to them by transmitting a transaction to the network.  It publicly records it on an open ledger that you authorized the transaction. The private key is like your email password that you do not give out to anyone.  It is what lets you spend the bitcoins at the corresponding public key.
So bitcoin is kind of like sending an email.

If bitcoin gets to the point of processing 25 mil transactions per day the 99% will be more like 99.999998% that will not need to wait for 1 confirmation.

First of all they would not be able to immediately arbitrage.  If I know the community, as soon as they find out what these coins were bought for, they will try and drop the price below it.  Therefore it is not riskless at all.  
It is actually a lot of risk buying these coins.  The people with the money able to even bid on this will take the risk into account over everything else.  In other words, they will not lose money on this deal.
Edit:  Not arguing, I just like the discussion and you have great points.
@_date: 2014-06-17 14:31:22
I tend to agree.  My first thought is that they would be sold in the 200-400 range.  I find it hard to believe that anyone would bid over market price.  You cannot estimate this by looking at how much it would move the market if they were all bought at once on the open market.
@_date: 2014-03-16 18:47:09
They also do it to hide orders/walls on the books.  I would think that it makes it a bit harder to make quick decisions.

@_date: 2015-09-21 17:27:22
I agree.  It will be interesting to watch them.  Altcoins might have their place in spots around the world, but like you said, you go back to bitcoin.
Edit:  I would actually love it if it was easy enough and secure for every business to create their own altcoin.  Imagine if you could get TargetCoins for rewards for shopping instead of mail in rebates or all of the other BS they use.  Then have a mobile wallet that can add or delete any altcoin and have them all in one place with seamless trading.  Gyft is sort of getting there but we need to use cryptocurrencies that cannot be defrauded or stolen and retain value that can be easily traded.
@_date: 2015-09-21 13:58:48
And the attacks just make me more confident it is disrupting things.
@_date: 2015-09-21 16:21:23
Well, it is not so much that bitcoin is just better at everything such as block times and size.  There are a **lot** of technical things you can change to make an altcoin.  I think there may be better forks out there but I think they will never get the network support that bitcoin already has.  I don't have the time to follow it in depth enough but I also don't think anybody is really spending the cash and development into mining chips like bitcoin.  Except maybe banks.
Now the mining, which the word confuses a lot when applied to bitcoin.  It is simply the security behind the network.  
Money needs security online.   Bitcoin solved it first.

The bitcoin transaction is being corrected.  So nobody is kissing anyone's money goodbye, at least in this case.  
A phone call might have fixed it for the old guy that got reimbursed from the bank, but the teen has to reimburse the bank.  Now the bank has to wait to get it back from the "idiot" teen.  
I agree he is an idiot but that is not the point, that is just the first article that popped up when I did a simple search for incorrect deposits.  It's also from March 10th 2015, this kind of thing happens all the time.  This was fixed by firing the employee.
@_date: 2015-04-26 13:02:24


Are you really going to get that petty.  If someone steals a $20 bill, a *new transaction* takes place when the bad guy gives it back.  I know that is hard to understand.


Let me guess, its more immutable than bank balance sheets.  Hell, it only takes one person to add a couple zeros when nobody is looking.  Show me where some one or a group of individuals *edit* the blockchain everytime a bug gets discovered.  You can't.  There was one double spend and the guy returned it.  One transaction since the network started.  Now how many double spends happen every day in your legacy banking system?


No it is not.  If it were, we would not have coins worth anything close to even a penny.

Of less than $13.3 million have no minimum reserve requirement;
Between $13.3 million and $89.0 million must have a liquidity ratio of 3%;
Exceeding $89.0 million must have a liquidity ratio of 10%.[4]
