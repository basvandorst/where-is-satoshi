Increasing the denominator is fine (and might even happen with Bitcoin someday) as long as you keep everyone's stake proportional.

I think the design is alright! Though I'm not sure why you got downvoted for criticism.
There are a few things that could be fixed up. I think the search bar should be open by default (and maybe a little bigger), because that's probably what I'll be using first.

I would still be able to buy things from overseas, like I use torrent websites hosted overseas. I could still use it for personal transactions, donations, or virtual goods (gift cards, steam games, bitcoin stocks). It's not a perfect a analogy, I agree, but this is just how I picture the future of a banned bitcoin.

Depends where you are. Here in NYC, I'm willing to bet Whole Foods does way more than 5,000. Hell, even my local supermarket (Foodtown) likely does more than that.

Good point. It does bring a lot of news to cryptocurrencies in general. 
I do agree with your point that it won't be just Bitcoin in the future. I guess I just don't like the whole meme/joke aspect of it. The community seems great.

I recommend finding a good credit union in your area. I have a savings/checking account with one in my area that is free and comes with a debit card, which I have set up to disallow overdrafts. Really good deal for me, since I'm a broke college student :P

I'd leave your website and never come back, to be honest.

If the database was stolen and contains password hashes, you could have a website set up where you ask people to enter their passwords and still know if they're entering the wrong ones, but steal the correct ones by saving them in plaintext when the hashes match.

You don't need confirmations for low-value transactions. Nobody is going to spend millions on a double-spend attack to cheat you out of $20. This is how Coinbase's online merchant payments work - you send the right amount of BTC to the address they specify, and the payment is confirmed instantly and your order is complete (at least, that's my experience with the Humble Bundle and feralhosting).
@_date: 2014-02-27 22:16:31
Okay, but IMO it will be just like regulating illegal downloads. Obviously the implications will be vastly different considering it's an entire currency we're talking about, but the regulation won't be any more effective.

Not true, you can make your own node with different rules. If you can get most of the network to agree with your rules, you just modified the protocol.

22 times is about half as much as 30-40 times (what martypete said). That's why I said "way less".

Yes, but nothing there means that it can bypass a firewall. Sure, it can tunnel through NAT, but if you disallow these connections it's not like it has a plan B.

Right...? The VNC listening for connections from the public.... Why wouldn't you at least set up a VPN tunnel for external connections and firewall off everything else

Prices are determined by demand and supply on the markets, nothing else. The majority of supply isn't miners, but other speculators.

Sentiments have really changed. Last year, anyone other than the kids I knew at school who were tech savvy, would immediately call it out as a scam.
This year I presented a speech using Bitcoin as the topic in my speech class. I got a lot of amazing questions from the audience, and even my elderly professor was really into it. My dad finally asked me about it after hearing me talk about it for years, and he invested some money and actually spent some BTC rather than just holding.
The future is looking good. :)

For instance, many online websites don't store your balance in a wallet, but rather a database. It would be a pretty huge clusterfuck if some sites didn't switch on time and you withdrew 1/1000th of how much they owed you.
It's easier to just switch to a decimal.
@_date: 2013-11-25 07:06:11
Not sure why you're being downvoted. This is true. One of the possible ways the protocol can be amended is additional decimal points.

3) Most hashes do not return bitcoins. The network agrees upon a 'difficulty', based on the current hashing power. The higher the difficulty, the more difficult it is to find a hash that generates bitcoins. Once a hash is found that generates bitcoins, the hash is sent out across the network, and 25 (currently, will be halved in the future) BTC are given to the wallet of the hashing entity.
