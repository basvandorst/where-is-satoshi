Forgive my ignorance, but isn't buying USD with your VEF an alternative? After all, USD is less volatile from BTC.
@_date: 2018-01-28 15:42:47
Amazing explanation. Thanks!
@_date: 2018-01-26 12:13:36
I see! Thanks for the clarification.
@_date: 2018-01-28 10:55:26
ELI5 please? What is tether?
@_date: 2018-09-20 10:37:20
So if we assume mass adoption, then that means less volatility, which means less speculation. So mass adoption will also decrease the price in some sense.
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:03:41
Could you elaborate? Why would the price sky-rocketing indicate there might be a huge buy? Wouldn't a rational buyer wait for a dip?
@_date: 2018-09-18 10:08:14


Bitcoin itself does not despise anything. It's people that do.


I don't believe this is true. Success is defined by adoption IMHO and this is much more complex than just an ETF.


Whales benefit from more volatility, not less.


That's too pessimistic. It's an interesting time with Lightning, DEXs etc.

Don't want to be a party-pooper but wouldn't it be a smart move (promotion-wise) if that "someone" was Andreas himself?
@_date: 2018-09-18 17:34:22
I think you're misinterpreting "interesting" as "bad".
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:00:50
Big players bumping the price to sell makes sense to me. I think this time of the year would be great timing to do this, since psychologically I think people are feeling more generous when Christmas are approaching. So there will be probably big buys until the end of the year, I suppose.
Just my opinion though.
@_date: 2018-09-02 06:45:31
Why you're assuming someone is "pushing it to your face" and not just giving it to you as a present? If it's interesting, I'll read it.
@_date: 2018-09-18 09:31:08
I just can't wait for the future 5-6 months. Whatever may happen, it's interesting. Anyone else with me?
@_date: 2018-09-18 09:12:21
They were *forced*, not chose to wait. There's a difference.
@_date: 2018-09-18 10:56:03
Yeah whatever.

The butterfly effect.
@_date: 2018-09-27 15:38:13
Never in their site I've read the term "Bitcoin". They refer to a blockchain-powered technology, but do they actually use bitcoin or some other coin of their own?
@_date: 2018-09-10 07:34:13
Oops. Pardon me.. :/
@_date: 2018-09-01 11:18:15

Thanks for the explanation!
@_date: 2018-09-20 08:09:36
Out of curiosity, how much BTC this could account to? Is there a way to estimate this? Or in fact, *know* it?
@_date: 2018-09-20 14:21:30
What if the current price is manipulation and not actual liquidity?
@_date: 2018-08-31 07:53:06

@_date: 2018-10-01 12:45:27
It's great to see it being adopted, but as a currency, not as a means to make more money. Just my opinion though.
@_date: 2018-10-15 07:37:09
The question itself makes no sense.
@_date: 2018-10-10 07:00:36
False dichotomy.
@_date: 2018-10-11 07:17:47
True this. Bitcoin needs more thorough testing and development procedures established.
@_date: 2018-10-01 08:54:33
Isn't it strange that so much people put their hopes on a single company? I guess it's the people that want to make money from bitcoin (ie. the majority).
@_date: 2018-10-04 06:32:28
Just a thought that occurred to me while reading this article: What if banks are forced by cryptocurrencies to have competent prices (so that they don't become obsoletE), somehow make transfers cheap and fast? Won't BTC loose some value then? Honest question.

It's more like 3-5$ per month.
@_date: 2017-08-23 14:34:09
Newbie here, some questions:
1. Isn't Segwit already activated around a month ago?
2. Why OP claims that Segwit2x is beneficial to large mining pools? How does it benefit them?
3. Is Segwit2x generally supported by Core developers?
4. What's Segwit8x vs Segwit2x?
@_date: 2017-08-17 16:56:10
That's pretty much how public-key cryptography works and is not relevant to my question.
@_date: 2018-10-04 06:45:40
Right. I've edited my question. Can you please read it again?
@_date: 2018-06-25 21:05:09
These seem like answers
@_date: 2019-10-27 19:31:59
Just look at the charts
@_date: 2019-10-02 09:31:40
I'm curious, why are you referring specifically to LN? I guess for  that specific use-case (central bank pays companies), using plain old on-chain transactions is going to be sufficient.

Why converting to USD and not just keep it a fixed amount of BTC? If they were really into bitcoin, they should state:

The proposal is not to just spend your BTC. It's to spend your BTC _and_ replenish _at least_ what you used. This is superior to just holding because it also supports Bitcoin's economy, which is good for you too, actually.
@_date: 2017-09-29 19:24:17
An honest question I have: how come some key people like Gavin and Jeff _do_ support segwit2x HF?
Above all, they are good developers and technically know that this HF doesn't have to be rushed and should implement replay protection. If so, how come they support it?
That's the only weird part of the story for me.
@_date: 2017-09-08 14:39:32
Thanks for clarifying.
@_date: 2017-09-08 06:35:30
Why is that? Why not 1 or 0? What's special about 2?

So to get this straight, bcash has already happened and its source code is located at: 
And segwit2x HF will happen on November and its code is located at  right? Is that right?
So are there people already running segwit2x clients? If so, they see the same chain as bitcoin core until November? Are all these companies already running segwit2x code?

Of course they processed them before, otherwise segwit wouldn't be called a _soft_ fork.

And what you earn is in BTC or in USD? So when you cash out, you will always get the BTC amount listed in your profile?

On the other hand, if you don't spend it eventually it's useless.
@_date: 2017-10-16 17:26:04
Not necessarily though.
@_date: 2017-10-16 17:16:03
Technical question: Does this mean they just upgraded their full node to a version that supports segwit?
@_date: 2018-11-13 14:46:32
That's a superpower.

If it's infeasible, we shouldn't have to explain that it would destroy the value proposition of Bitcoin.
On the other hand, if we worry about it, maybe it means that we're not sure it's infeasible?
@_date: 2019-05-30 14:18:03
The term "intrinsic value" is thrown out so often that it's now pissing me off. There's no such thing as "intrinsic value" - value is something we humans perceive in our minds and there's nothing "intrinsic" about it.
I'd even argue that the term "intrinsic value" is an oxymoron.
@_date: 2019-05-03 09:08:40
What's that "premium"? Honest question.
@_date: 2019-05-20 08:48:30


No it's not. It precise and accurate - wholefoods *will be accepting Bitcoin,* which means that people will be able to use Bitcoin to buy stuff there.
What they do with it, is another subject.
