Owning costs the world nothing, buying / selling / transferring does

Not that it's really relevant, but what is your source?
@_date: 2018-01-19 16:19:01
You have misunderstood. I am saying that I thought the 1 block per 10 minutes restriction was added so that not too many new coins would be created too regularly (thus causing hyperinflation) - and that once all BTC are in existence we could increase the number of blocks per minute.
@_date: 2018-01-26 10:04:26
A very accurate one: 
@_date: 2018-01-10 13:18:24
It's not centralised, it has a coordinator running until there are enough devices on the system to make it reliable enough to operate without it. It was recently turned off for a while, I don't think anyone noticed, did they?
@_date: 2018-01-14 12:00:49
"Zero fees" - Are you claiming nobody mined it, no miners were paid, or that there were fees but they were deferred to another part of the process (pay in advance, etc)?
@_date: 2018-01-10 11:55:35


Mostly I'd agree, with the exception of IOTA. At least that works differently.
@_date: 2018-01-19 14:18:08
1 block every 10 minutes means fewer transactions per minute and therefore low supply. Higher supply would bring down transaction fees.

1: Go to a bank and get a loan
2: Use that loan to buy BTC

They were selling flowers that hadn't been grown yet, and assuming they would grow without problems. Then they were selling flowers that hadn't grown yet in fields that hadn't yet been deforrested. If what I read was correct, in the end they were selling tulips not only that didn't exist but that couldn't exist. It was all a massive bubble because their value was escalated so high based merely on the fact that people were confident they could sell on their investments to others for more money, and was (in the end) nothing to do with selling anything of any value.
I'm no historian, just passing on what I recall.
@_date: 2018-01-31 11:20:23
No, people started calling the original "BitCoinCash" - some time later Roger Ver came along and stole the name and assigned it to a fork of that technology!

Lots of young people getting rich, then more businesses seeing the value and jumping on board. I started on the Internet in about 94ish.

Is IOTA also susceptible to the Sybil attack?
@_date: 2018-01-10 15:07:55
IOTA org, but once there are enough devices on the network it will be made redundant.
The currency isn't centralised, it is temporarily chaperoned. I don't think that's a problem, and I doubt it is unique.

What is the intrinsic value of £1, or $1?
@_date: 2018-01-11 09:33:35
Same applies to all open-source coins that have ever been or ever will be.
If Samsung and Mitsubishi exchange value using this technology, will they use SamsungOTA or MitsubishIOTA? What about when they interact with Testla and countless others? IOTA is likely to become the standard coin in this area.
@_date: 2018-01-12 13:34:54
Buy a Trezor or Ledger Nano S and hold your coins with that.
@_date: 2017-12-23 10:53:38
That's more like IOTA than BitCoin.

I once read they were selling tulips that didn't yet exist, and were over-speculating to the point where they didn't have enough fields to grow the tulips that had already been sold.

Coinbase have been putting up alerts for days explaining there is a backlog, and that they are looking at using other providers to fulfil them.

There are many other places you can buy them. For example, BlockChain.info

Not 100% sure, but if you paid via bank transfer I have been told the price you ordered at is the price you will pay.
Sit back, relax, and wait for the backlog to get processed.

@_date: 2017-12-20 17:31:32
I don't understand his argument either. I am guessing that other currencies devalue due to inflation, and blockchain difficulty is supposed to prevent that. However, it wouldn't stop people from buying it at increasingly higher USD values and then suddenly discovering they no longer have anyone left to sell to, because the price is too high.
I don't think BTC will be the world currency of the future, that's probably going to be something that works much faster, like IOTA. In the meantime, I will ride the price up. When my investment doubles I will take my initial investment back and then keep whatever coin I have left just in case the price continues to grow.
@_date: 2017-12-18 15:35:59
I read that CoinBase stores most of its coin in cold storage, and users are insured against losses through their website being hacked.

Mine took about 5 days from the point of transfer. Did you add the reference to the bank transfer that you were told to include?
@_date: 2017-12-27 14:32:38
Other than "I have thought of a good name" is there any reason to proceed? For example, does it do something better than any other coin, such as the way IOTA uses a Tangle instead of a block chain?
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:15:21

Processing a bitcoin transaction requires more work to complete than a Visa transaction. I see no reason therefore why Visa cannot always be cheaper.

Democratised, no. We don't get to vote for who should own the coins.

The moment you walk into a bank and apply for a loan you are not loaned money that exists, you have just invented money.
@_date: 2018-02-18 10:18:47
As far as I understand it there are mathematical problems employed that are crypto secure (hashes) and those that aren't (private keys).
The problem won't be the increased hashing power but that it will be easy to take someone's public key and work out their private key - thus enabling anyone to pretend to be you and sell your coins.
This is interesting.

I, possibly like the majority of the people on the planet, have never watched it so I wouldn't know.


You just did it again. You are associating being called a homosexual with being an attack on your values.


The best way to do that is to not be the person to bring it up.


Being homosexual also has nothing to do with either. You brought it up, not me.


It's nothing to do with how you worded your statement. It's because you discouraged ad-hominems based on your sexuality, which implies homosexuality is a negative association. You don't deserve to not be disparaged on account that you aren't a homosexual, but because nobody should be disparaged for being a homosexual.


You are free to say whatever you like, just as I am free to tell you I think poorly of you for saying it. If you feel like hiding from the world every time this happens to you in life then the Internet is the wrong place for you to be.


If you said "Oh yeah, I didn't think of that" or added ("That's a Seinfeld joke)" I'd be very happy. But you aren't here to make me happy, so you can do what you like. I just wanted to make sure you were aware.


No, I haven't. I am unable to stop you from posting your opinions, and I wouldn't if I could. You are being overdramatic. Nobody has stopped you from doing anything.


I don't care if you are offended. Your feelings are not my concern. Try replacing the criteria with another human attribute that is beyong the individual's control. For example, try replacing the word "gay" with "black", see how it reads then from the point of view of someone reading your post without the benefit of knowing what you had in mind when you wrote it.


Or, you could be mature about this experience. Accept that it wasn't a big deal, learn from it, and move on knowing that you are better equipped to not give the wrong impression about your opinions.

Apart from this part, it was a good post. Being a homosexual is not a slur, you don't have to announce that you aren't gay. Not only is it irrelevant, but it would not be a negative thing if you were.

The exchange owns the wallets. One wallet might have 50 BTC in it even though you only own 0.5. The exchange software should keep track of how much is yours, but they screwed up and released too much existing by to you.
