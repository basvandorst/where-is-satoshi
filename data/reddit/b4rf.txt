I dont know about coinbase directly but I wouldnt try since their fees are much higher I think.
@_date: 2019-07-02 09:48:17
Maybe you are confusing cause and effect?
When the price rises many people panic and try to get their orders in, and this is even more true for all those bots operating on the coinbase api. Maybe they weren't able to handle such a huge workload and to prevent failures they had to shut down for a short period of time.
And after such a price rise it is almost certain that a downward trend is following, so put your tinfoil hats back and keep accumulating.
@_date: 2019-07-15 12:59:44
The 300 sats refer to the fees of the transaction not the actual amount send which could be even multiple btc.
@_date: 2019-07-27 14:24:56
I would guess it depends on your exchange. I wrote a simple bot for kraken and gdax which is running on my raspberry pi.
I decided to shut it down recently tho to prevent taxation. Now I am just buying from time to time. I would say thats more profitable in the long run.

Their support page about fiat deposits:
"Multiple deposits in the same amount made within 3 business days of each other may be delayed. If you make multiple deposits within 3 business days of each other, please send different amounts."
I guess this happens due to automatic processes which dont work consistently with duplicated transactions or something like that. Stay calm and hope for the btc price to drop ;D
@_date: 2019-07-27 14:33:25
I remember having all those dust transactions from faucets and one day sending the whole amount to another address to save fees in later transactions.
If the amount was large enough you would get your transaction within some days even without fees.

Yes channels have no routes but I would guess that you can choose two nodes within the network which have to use many intermediate nodes to transfer funds (and yes I know that no one can actually see the whole lightning network).
Your comparison doesnt work. For the easy of the example I will have only 3 nodes in my lightning network: 1-2-3
I open a channel with node 1 and with node 3. Then I will send funds repeatedly from 1 to 3. This way the node 2 will increase his "buffer" with node 1 and decrease his buffer with node 3 up until the point where he has no more funds to send towards node 3 (correct me if I am wrong).
Afterwards transactions through node 2 will only be possible into the direction of node 1. In a higher scale with a large amount of funds you would be able to unbalance a large number of nodes into one direction. 
@_date: 2018-08-03 06:34:51
Sorry, but I guess even constructive criticism is not very welcome in this subreddit.

@_date: 2018-05-31 07:20:21
I just thought about an easy and legal attack against the lightning network.
What if someone opens two different channels to the network with the longest route possible through the network. Now he always sends "high amounts" from one channel to the other through lightning and afterwards creates an onchain transaction from the receiver back to the sending channel and repeats this over and over.
Wouldn't this drain multiple buffers in the lightning network and make nodes only operate into one direction?

@_date: 2018-08-03 06:56:32
And it also ignores that someone might close a channel for whatever reason and open new ones.
Don't get me wrong, I am all in on lightning but we should take things like this seriously and think about solutionsor workarounds.
Don't just rely on someone else to fix all the problems because if thats the mindset of all of us then lightning will never be used in the everyday life without obstacles.

I buy every x% price drop and sell a protion of that after a certain price rise. This way I increase my btc amount and do my part on keeping the price more stable. And btw this is done by a self written bot which runs 24/7 and therefore I dont have to worry about missing out ;)

Lightning is a second layer above bitcoin and any other coin that implements segwit can use Lightning as well.
And you only have an onchain transaction for funding and closing your channel which would make your pizza purchase not directly be stored in the blockchain but depending on the amount of other transactions you make between funding and closing it would be very much obfuscated.

@_date: 2019-01-11 06:41:50
random private keys someone lost access to and some block rewards miners fucked up.
@_date: 2019-01-09 06:48:25
Does running a full node + ln node consume much of your bandwidth?
I have a pi lying around and was considering setting one up in case it has no pain points for my everyday usage.
@_date: 2018-03-27 14:13:39
And the drop was after a 400% increase so who is selectively looking at only one side ;)
@_date: 2019-01-07 08:14:10
You should be able to avoid suspicious nodes. And all lightning channels are backed by actual bitcoins so I dont think this analogy really works out.
But it's worth a thought.
@_date: 2018-03-06 07:26:42
Same for Enjin Coin (ENJ) but it simply doesnt get mass adoption I think.
@_date: 2018-11-15 09:20:04


This is bs right?
The difficulty automatically adjusts so that a block will be mined about every 10 min
@_date: 2019-01-15 11:33:12
But he doesnt has usd, he has btc. And at any given time after his comment the amount will have changed. So he could simply not say any amount at all since nobody knows how much it actually was or is.
Edit: Oh and most people on this planet are not using usd btw.
@_date: 2019-01-09 15:41:35
Ok thanks.
@_date: 2019-01-10 09:28:51
If you have the mnemonic or private key then someone will be able to  help you.
BUT MOST IMPORTANT! Don't send these to anyone otherwise they will be able to transfer your btc to their wallets and steal it.
@_date: 2018-11-28 13:12:23
Wrong, each buy has a corresponding sell. So the same amount of people bought and sold.
The difference is that more people were willing to sell for lower prices then to buy for higher ones.
@_date: 2019-01-15 06:30:05
Lets say this would actually be done (spoiler: it wont). How do you inform all people that this change will take place and that everyone with long hold coins need to move them?
And how about lightning channels or similar contracts. Do I need to close those and recreate just to secure my balance from being handed over to the miners?
This would destroy btc I would guess.
@_date: 2019-01-09 06:37:09
I am not saying bitcoin is not secure. The incident was handled pretty well I think.
But saying bitcoin has NEVER been hacked is wrong because "never" is also valid 9 years ago.
And btw there has been found another bug just some months ago but it was discovered before someone was able to exploit it.

Guys...I think he is planning to time travel...
@_date: 2018-11-06 06:23:20
Nice work.
But signing a message with my private key in an online environment seems risky to me...
@_date: 2019-01-15 06:21:07
yeah I dont get it why people start talking in usd on this sub. Like have you checked where you are posting? Dont you think there is a more appropriate currency to use?
@_date: 2019-01-07 08:09:09
But £1000 &gt; $1000 ...
@_date: 2018-03-12 07:30:47


Maybe you are just plain stupid because of being unable to read the 3 sentences linked in the post.
@_date: 2018-03-16 07:18:49
It's a really weird situation that there are lost so many coins already and it will be more and more over time.
And nobody actually knows how many coins are lost forever.
@_date: 2019-01-15 06:39:15
You do realize that they need to ship you the item you buy right? Doesn't make a difference which currency you use they can still enclose their shipping range.
@_date: 2018-11-16 09:29:36
I never said I could time the market...read my comment again.
@_date: 2019-01-15 11:29:50
Your assumption is false.
He gave them btc. So He was calculating his btc to usd instead of simply saying the amount of btc he gave them.
@_date: 2019-01-09 07:15:23
73.6% of all statistics are made up.
@_date: 2019-01-11 06:38:33
Or simply add smaller units? And this is already happening in lightning.
@_date: 2018-03-22 07:38:46
I think the general argumentation against a 51% attack is that if you are able to provide so many hash power you would do better by simply not attacking but instead taking the miners fee/block reward.
But this doesnt really seem to work in the case of a government since they are not heading for profit but control and therefore wouldnt care about the bitcoin gains but simply try to destroy the bitcoin value.
@_date: 2018-03-14 07:12:01
I hodl because I lost my private key.
@_date: 2019-01-22 06:14:23
I think our current state is "YIKES"

@_date: 2019-01-10 08:25:57
Maybe someone sold all his coins?
Selling all alts for btc and then all btc for fiat. First one will drop the alt towards btc and the second will drop btc price which most of the time affects all alts as well.
@_date: 2019-01-08 14:27:38
I will just leave this here.
@_date: 2018-03-12 15:08:56
I guess someone joined the hype train at 19k and now spreads his madness...

I tried to use my Coinbase account after at least 4 years and had the same trouble.
Took them almost 3 months to activate my account but this took place in january so maybe you will have a faster resopnse.
@_date: 2018-03-29 14:54:21
Do you even economics bro?
@_date: 2018-02-06 07:48:02
So I should sell everytime it goes down and if it rebounds I should buy back in for a higher price?
Will add this strat to my tradebot, thanks!

Who talks about selling?
@_date: 2018-02-15 07:37:23
This was the first bitcoin meme I saved some time ago since it perfectly fits my argumentation when someone asks me about bitcoin "investments".
@_date: 2018-02-15 07:31:21
Sounds good, doesn't work.
@_date: 2018-02-28 07:01:48
I am pretty sure he is serious.

Dont you see the patterns?

I have a calculator but I dont like the fact that it supports this useless square root function.

@_date: 2019-09-18 05:27:00
But did someone login into your account or not? They didn't answer anything.
@_date: 2018-07-05 06:10:00
I see what you did there
@_date: 2018-07-25 05:58:36
Someone bought at 20k € (yes €) on kraken when the site went back life after a longer downtime.
I guess he placed a big market order and the order book was almost empty.
Never underestimate the stupidity of some people.
Edit: I am not saying that this is therefore the ATH btw
@_date: 2018-07-25 05:40:18
The price is not dependant on the mining cost.
That's not how it works.
@_date: 2018-07-11 11:06:38
But does the pool know my identity?
I can use a trashmail for registration and I would be fine.
@_date: 2019-09-10 10:14:17
It's still possible to owe someone more than 21 million btc.

Dont comment on this post guys!
He just wants to know which reddit users own more then 1BTC!
DONT FALL FOR THE SCAM
@_date: 2018-07-25 05:37:41
We need to create a sell wall at that level.
@_date: 2018-07-25 05:54:31
20$ is a cheap lesson.
Might have saved you big money in the future.

Time to ask your friend where you can meet up with David and break some knee caps.

@_date: 2018-02-27 14:50:53
I am pretty sure he is serious.
I am almost as confident as him but I think the price will stop at 1 mil and it will take a bit longer then 2020.
@_date: 2018-04-04 10:32:35
It's not really "in Russian" tho...
@_date: 2018-04-24 06:10:28
Now go and check some vulnerabilities on their website and make it real.

Why do you promote this ponzi site?
And why does no mod take care of this?
@_date: 2018-04-20 06:14:45
Why would the price drop by 60% in the capitulation phase?
At that point the price should be very stable or slowly going upwards I think.

Oh, my sweet summer child.
@_date: 2018-04-24 09:33:13
What do you use to buy your bitcoin?
Do you get paid in bitcoin already? If so, nice for you but most people still get paid in fiat.
@_date: 2018-04-04 13:20:08
I am not talking about the location but the writing.
Although those letters are russian they dont translate into facebook.
@_date: 2018-04-09 06:31:54
Sometimes I feel bad for those people...
But then I think about my lambo and feel great again.
@_date: 2018-04-22 14:46:26
I didnt assume it. At that point no one took any actions.
I was just asking. Maybe this is allowed and I didn't know.
@_date: 2018-04-09 06:03:31
Thats not really an alternative since its around the same price.
@_date: 2018-04-12 06:16:11
Reminds me of the earlier days where you just used one input of at least 0.1 BTC and a bunch of dust inputs to collect them without paying any fees.
Took some hours or maybe even days but as long as you are in no rush you were fine.
@_date: 2018-04-05 06:03:09
[You don't say?](
@_date: 2018-04-19 06:41:14
No. All transactions within exchanges are accounted as hold by the exchange.
So most likely exchanges are one of the big hodlers in these charts.
@_date: 2018-04-24 09:35:15
@_date: 2018-04-26 06:33:01
Same here. Except that I didnt intent to buy but my bot went on a rampage and I realised it too late. Fixed it and now I hope that the price goes up instead of dropping :D
@_date: 2018-04-18 06:25:53
I dont think I would tell anyone that I own a million bitcoins. You would only make yourself a target...

btc is worth only $160 ????
fuck what happened?
@_date: 2019-05-17 05:49:04
most common causes to lose your bitcoin:
1. boating accident
2. 5$ wrench
3. wiped hard drive
@_date: 2019-05-29 13:00:54
Do you have a source for this?
I would really like to see his point of view.
@_date: 2019-05-27 05:21:13
Why would you sell if bitcoin does so well in the next years?
I would buy a house and in my day to day life simply spend and replace.
@_date: 2019-05-16 11:35:58

There are still people using poloniex?
@_date: 2018-12-14 13:57:22
Using one coin as reference is exactly how you mesure which one lost the most.
You could use BCash as reference too and you would see that BTC gained value in comparison. It's just another perspective at the same result.

@_date: 2018-12-11 06:45:58
Or maybe if more people would run linux there would be more exploits found/created for linux since it would make it profitable as well. 
Just maybe...

@_date: 2019-05-07 04:57:50
I know where you are coming from but this has nothing to do with inflation but more supply and demand.
The current inflation rate of bitcoin is still higher than the one of USD and I think this will change after the next halvening to be lower for the very first time.

I think his point is that obviously the "slave" will not be rewarded in dept slavery but the guys who lend the money. That's why they try so hard to get people into wanting a loan.

I am no expert but doesn't this sound a bit like proof of stake.

Makes me happy that at least one got it :D
@_date: 2019-05-07 05:02:27
Wouldnt help in this case tho since all the damage is done on your exchange account which is most likely known to the IRS
