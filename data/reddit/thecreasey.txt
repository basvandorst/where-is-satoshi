How the about and it will show a link to Btc live chat
@_date: 2019-06-05 00:01:09
E.x. When btc was hovering around 8500, there were some periods where I sold a tiny amt of btc for a silly %, then purchased 5 min later, acquiring an extra .1. Btc  basically for free

I agree that it’s a good sign, but let’s not forget that Microsoft was like  a “ Let’s monopolize everything, fuck everybody” way doing business until Apple and Google became viable competitors.

You’re a joke man. Stop trolling.

Agree that we need to add some cock and balls to maintain this as OUR, the people’s way of transacting, not fucking Wall Street and Congress...they’ve cocked and balled us enough already.
@_date: 2019-06-05 08:14:12
Yes, because more people owning BtC are pussies who sell, and sell, until the whale comes back...except now he’s  got 30 k btc

Why 7200? I raise that to 7,800

Savings accounts = perpetuating a financial scheme where your money gets taken to make more more for the bank, assuring you a measly return. Fuck savings accounts and fuck the banks.
@_date: 2019-06-04 23:58:28
IMO: You have to play back (a little bit) by capitalizing on the fear induced volatility by trading ...increase your BTC. Only 21 million exist, I think it’s important to acquire as many as you can while being responsible .
@_date: 2019-06-05 07:32:33
I suppose. But if the end game is that  eventually BTC blows up, the HODLs missed out on some easy money. And I’m not reading anything but 5% or my stake in BTC.
(Edit: trading, not reading l)

Pre-FOMO = buy

A % if the current value of bitcoin that is disproportionately ends up in my favor, e.g. if, as expected, the price of .1 BTC is about to drop, and I sell it at a point high that, perhaps 1-5 minutes increases back to that point or above. I then buy (essentially convert that .1)  into, say, .109 or even .11, incurring only $2.00 in fees. Simply put, I got more ownership by incurring no costs. [edit: in response to  below

Unless ur just being sarcastic, I don’t know or care.
@_date: 2019-06-05 07:33:57
One could argue the unfavorable opinion here that not doing something is risky too, though. Don’t get me wrong, I’m 95% HODL, 5% trading.
@_date: 2019-06-05 08:39:14
To be honest, 25 to 30 BTC is  the “true whale” i.e. the so called 1%- is what he or she could wipe his or her ass with every morning
@_date: 2019-06-19 03:16:47
Got liquidated despite being buying long on btc. Lost 3k in 2 seconds.
@_date: 2019-06-05 07:42:35
Coming from some named “buy_bitcoin” you’re response is surprising. If you read what you wrote, it’s a relatively less risky way of “buying coin.”

No. That would require “guaranteed” as being interpreted as being contractual offer. Contract law 101 bruh

I’ll do whatever you say if you can explain in 5th grade terms and in three sentences what I need to do. 
1. Do this...

3.  Etc.

I know, you’re probably thinking “this guys a fucking moron.” Honestly, I’m just bad with money. I’m thinking of this as a way to mitigate damages. If I buy btc now when it’s high, knowing it will probably drop in the short term,  at least I can preempt myself from blowing it all...plus, it gives the added benefit of continuing to compulsively watch this market (which I find oddly more entertaining than almost everything in life lol). 
@_date: 2019-04-13 12:26:28
This is a joke right

This is a long-haul move. I don’t See it going back to 3K. Considering a triple digit move in anticipation of regulatory scheme being more beneficial or less hostile than people worry.

Obviously rather buy at 4K, but ... seeing as I run a good chance of  blowing my last 5 grand in booze, drugs, and broads...maybe I should just make another purchase of btc?

Ok. I already made the stupid decision of buying from coinbase, so I'll have to figure that out too. But thank you, I love this community.

I can’t pretend to have anything other than a general sense that bitcoin is going to change the world significantly. I don’t take specific advice seriously, but, I must say, the collective intellect underlying this movement is enough to make me a believer. That said, I blew my load on BTC today, reserving enough funds to pay for school expenses. I am officially balls deep in this thing, 
@_date: 2019-04-04 14:01:54

@_date: 2019-04-05 03:47:11
Bro, you're take yourself waaaayyy too seriously. The fact you think I made a "prediction" shows (1) that you *yourself* cannot detect sarcasm -- besides, are people not allowed to make outlandish remarks in jest on these forums? Is this a "no nonsense" business casual only forum? 
And (2) the fact that you called me a schmuck implies that "it hasn't all been sarcastic" from your perspective.


Who are you, the Batman of r/Bitcoin?  Some people like to have fun, apparently you are not one of them. Get off your high horse, stop drinking non-alcoholic beverages, and go to the beach (maybe on a boat, perhaps).

It's beyond "trusting gut"...it's seeing the forest instead of the trees...having an awareness of how things are evolving around us and, in turn, having a reasonable belief that the prediction in right. IMO, the evolution of BTC is like the advent of the internet, which I was too young to experience. That being said, I'm sure there were signs that, to an acute eye, would signal a shift worth taking a risk on.
@_date: 2019-05-28 15:41:52
terrible analogy
@_date: 2019-05-28 19:24:29
BUT why don't you see hedgers investing in alt coins is reliable reason to conclude, "hey, people are investing in BTC for reasons other than their gut feeling?"
@_date: 2019-05-28 19:20:14
Agreed. Fucking gold, lol.
@_date: 2019-05-28 23:00:40
I think you have to operate under the assumption that hedgers has already determined that crypto is viable investment, but I agree their involvement it might lessen the concept or actual value of btc.
