I'm still in the 1.9.7 version.
Is the old seed format compatible with this new Electrum V.2?
If not, what is the safest way to update my wallet?

Nope, that flag is called the "estelada". It's the independence Catalan flag (northeast Spain).
But yeah, it has a historical relationship with Cuba and Puerto Rico because the design was inspired by those flags after they became independent from Spain:

Sending money to Spain is super easy. You can send Bitcoins to any spanish mobile phone and the recipient can withdraw Euros just from a normal ATM (no need of any credit/debit card). 
[There are a big ATMs network available.](
You only need to use one of these services:
* 
* 
* 
That or the more traditional bank transfer or Paypal.

Well, they have Spanish and Italian ancestors, but also mainly because this is a "remake" of an old 90's Italian techno song :p

Oh, that's not the case in Spain. Most ATMs can collect cash automatically. In fact they are more like multi purpose machines and they can offer so many kinds of financial and vending services. You can buy tickets for concerts and cinemas (you can even choose your favorite seat), museums and event tickets, you can pay taxes and fines, buy public transport tickets, money transfers, load cash in pre-paid phones and a lot more. 
I still remember when my American friends came to visit us to Barcelona they were very surprised with the ATMs cause apparently the ones in the USA were very basic in comparison.
