AFAIK I haven't advocated for right-wing politics at all if that was what you were implying. Also, Lambda Legal does much more than just propagate for LGBTs and HIV-infected people to be treated with respect. From Antonopoulos' Twitter posts we see Donald Trump with a big sign on his head reading "SUED". It's as political as it can get at that point.
@_date: 2017-12-25 16:11:46
And I think he should be free to do so if that's his wish. It's just that it's not particularly smart if he wants to reach out to as many as possible with Bitcoin. Just in the U.S.A. political ideas vary greatly from state to state. And the guy wants Bitcoin to scale to Africa, Middle East, etc. His ideas certainly are controversial globally.
@_date: 2017-12-25 18:23:23
You can see from several of my other posts that I also bring up the scalability issues Bitcoin is currently facing. If these aren't dealt with, Bitcoin will obviously sink. And like I've said before, I think Antonopoulos should feel happy to post on Twitter about whatever he fancies. But it's not particularly smart considering he also strives for scaling Bitcoin to billions of people that disagree with his liberal politics.
@_date: 2017-12-25 01:07:00
Why's that? From the responses on Antonopoulos tweets it seems clear this shifts focus away from the important issues Bitcoin is facing. Do we really need his left-wing political ideas on top of the enormous scalability issues Bitcoin is currently facing? I personally only care because I know others take offence from politics being embedded.
@_date: 2017-12-25 04:06:03
The difference is that Antonopoulos announced to all his followers on Twitter about liberal politics and publicly bashed Trump and advocated a liberal organization fighting for LGBTs and HIV-infected people. Basically he propagated for these political ideas as loud as he possibly could've done. He even encouraged others to donate as he had done.
@_date: 2017-12-25 16:00:56
We disagree. I think Bitcoin should aim solely at its purpose of providing financial freedom by delivering a fast and cheap transaction system. I don't think it'd be good if it was hijacked to support political ideas.
@_date: 2017-12-25 02:51:55
Obviously there are more than just religiously Christians and Muslims that disagree with liberal politics. But these are probably the most zealous opposers. By embedding liberal politics in his work on Bitcoin I think Antonopoulos could potentially lose a hefty sum of supporters. Specially if he steps up the frequency of his political remarks.
@_date: 2017-12-25 00:50:08
You'd be amazed at how much peoples beliefs differ regarding these matters. A lot of the elderly, religously Christians and Muslims for example view same sex marriage and LGBT adoption as obscene.
@_date: 2017-12-25 03:29:11
It definitely is. It can also be a libertarian viewpoint. Definitely not conservative or religiously Christian or Muslim though. By your definition you're also allowing incestuous relationships of most sorts which are even more controversial.
@_date: 2017-12-25 00:36:13
Exactly. Unfortunately others disregard what people have to say based on their political beliefs.
@_date: 2017-12-25 01:29:32
I agree. Whether Bitcoin benefits from that is another question. I for one think it's harmful in the quest for Bitcoin to scale.
@_date: 2017-12-25 00:17:49
Spot on! That's my point. While LGBT "rights" are becoming less and less controversial it certainly isn't for many religious communities. And like I gave an example for earlier, imagine if he was promoting something as obscene as bestiality? Would people be embracing his right to express himself or rather frown in disgust and lose a lot of Bitcoin supporters in the process?
@_date: 2017-12-25 03:59:31
If you think the entire world hates Trump then you're delusional. A perfect example is how Trump was received by the Chinese in comparison to how Obama was received. The guy didn't lose the popular vote by that much either. Also, take into consideration that Antonopoulos' liberal politics are extreme to Africans and Arabs among others.
@_date: 2017-12-25 01:26:44
Sure. It might be in that it strives for delivering financial freedom to mankind. But I don't see where liberal politics come in the picture.
@_date: 2017-12-25 00:56:16
You're drunk but you got your point across! Merry Christmas!
@_date: 2017-12-25 17:12:48
Sure. Libertarians embrace financial freedom, which is something Bitcoin aims at delivering. Ron Paul, a several times presidential candidate and a libertarian, however, is against abortion for example. Libertarians debate about whether illegalizing abortion is right or wrong. My point is that, even among libertarians, their standpoints on matters vary greatly. Thus we can't just say "Look! Bitcoin is libertarian/liberal!" and sling these politics at everyone even though these have nothing to do with Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-25 04:23:00
Would you care to elaborate? I think Bitcoin should be clear and simple. Specifically being a fast and cheap transaction system for mankind. By removing political ideas being promoted through Bitcoin I think it has a greater chance to succeed.
@_date: 2017-12-25 04:19:48
You can perfectly be a humanitarian without a liberal agenda. And yes, if what he wants to do is to take advantage of his position to spread his political standpoints then he should do that. I just don't find it particularly smart. What do you mean by "You are the one somehow linking that to bitcoin"? "somehow linking"? Christ... Obviously people recognize him for his work on Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-25 16:42:42
I agree. But considering the early stage of Bitcoin and the serious issues it's currently facing with transaction times and fees, we'd fare better without embedding politics in it. Just to scale Bitcoin is alone a very ambitious task. To start propagating for liberal politics which are considered detastable in huge parts of the world probably isn't that smart.
@_date: 2017-12-25 01:49:48
The community probably has different political views. In the way Antonopoulos posted on Twitter, it's clear he supports bashing on the president of the U.S.A. and I think that's a good move if you want to lose supporters. What backward attitudes are is another discussion.
@_date: 2017-12-25 03:24:16
That's where a lot of people disagree. And that's why I disagree on that it's a wise idea to embed political ideas within Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-25 04:13:48
Agreed. That's the case. I just think it's smart to set aside Bitcoin and personal political ideas as to reach out to as many as possible.
@_date: 2017-12-25 02:47:19
He's publicly supporting Lambda Legal, an organization that bashed the president of the U.S.A. and his administration for their stance on civil rights. The organization also strives for changing politics in favor of LGBTs.
@_date: 2017-12-25 01:13:10
I suppose that's why it's a political question, along with the fact that Lambda Legal also bashes the president of the U.S.A. and his administration. People simply have different opinions on whether same sex marriage is alright or not. Obviously religiously Christians and Muslims condemn homosexuality. Many elderly also condemn it due to the fact it was viewed as obscene when they grew up.
@_date: 2017-12-25 00:31:15
I only see a problem in the sense that others than myself exclude what people have to say regarding subjects if they find out their political ideas don't match their own.
@_date: 2017-12-25 03:22:02
That's the controversy. Is it being a decent human being by allowing 2 individuals of the same sex to marriage, or is it obscene? That's where liberals disagree with the religiously and conservatives.
@_date: 2017-12-25 03:06:40
I don't like what he did because I find it unprofessional. But I still enjoy a lot of what he says about Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-25 01:03:19
He's (the most?) prominent spokesman for Bitcoin. My idea about Bitcoin is to deliver a transaction system to mankind which is fast and cheap. I personally embrace Bitcoin for these simple and easy to understand features it strives for. That's why I think it's clever to tone down political ideas which have nothing to do with the product.
@_date: 2017-12-25 03:09:36
That's true. What I'm arguing for though is that it's not particularly smart for him to start advocating for liberal politcs. Specially not considering Bitcoin right now is facing really serious scalability issues. More controversies after another doesn't bode well.
@_date: 2017-12-25 02:33:58
The point is that there are a lot that disagree with these liberal ideas. Thus it might not be very effective to implement politics if his goal is to scale Bitcoin to as many as possible. While these ideas have gained ground in the Western world they certainly haven't in the Middle East or Africa for example. We're also at a very early stage for Bitcoin. We'd fare well without controversies right now.
@_date: 2017-12-25 03:03:55
I posted this because I dislike the idea of hijacking Bitcoin to promote political ideas. It's certainly not good for Bitcoin considering there are people with all kinds of religious and political beliefs that don't align well with Antonopoulos' liberal politics. AFAIK the only political accomplishment Bitcoin strives for is to provide financial freedom to mankind. Both a Christian theocracy and a fully genderqueer society can embrace that.
@_date: 2017-12-25 00:52:17
If Bitcoin was used solely to accomplish financial freedom that'd be wonderful. These other matters should be dealt with in other platforms.
@_date: 2017-12-25 17:32:40
First my thread was removed because it mentioned a "taboo" coin. I then reposted the thread without mentioning this coin and it was again removed. This time without notifying me for what reason.
Edit: This thread is now back up.
@_date: 2017-12-25 01:51:55
I'd love my kids regardless. I don't value someone over what they get excited about.
@_date: 2017-12-25 00:41:17
Personally I think Bitcoin should work exclusively on blessing mankind with a fast and cheap transaction system. Taking on religion simultaneously might be an overwhelming task, don't you think?
@_date: 2017-12-25 02:45:33
I understand. The problem is that a lot disregard what someone has to say based on their political beliefs. An example of what harm can be done when embedding politics in their crypto work was when Vitalik Buterin posted on Twitter that an unban on child pornography wouldn't be more controversial than an unban on heroin.
@_date: 2017-12-25 00:15:12
Well, considering Lambda Legal is trying to change politics in favor of LGBTs and HIV-infected people, that's certainly political. Supporting an organization that publicly bashes the president of the U.S.A. and his administration is even more so.
@_date: 2017-12-25 01:27:25
Where do you see me "hating" on anything?
@_date: 2017-12-25 00:28:00
I agree on that many supporting Bitcoin do it because they want to be set free from the banking system. But that doesn't mean they have a libertarian stance on every other subject. A religious Christian for example isn't libertarian on a lot of subjects considering he believes in theocracy. But Christian theocracy doesn't exclude Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-25 03:47:13
In the sense that he's probably the most prominent spokesman for Bitcoin and he advocated for these political ideas from the same . What he then says will undoubtely be seen in the context of him promoting Bitcoin in the same manner politicians are judged when they publicly advocate opinions. To illustrate with an example you can imagine him advocating something as obscene as bestiality or incestuous relationships. His support within the Bitcoin team and his Twitter followers count would obviously sink like a rock. It doesn't take a genius to figure that out. And no, I'm not likening liberal politics with these obscene things. I'm overexaggerating to help you understand some people dislike others political views.
@_date: 2017-12-25 01:08:36
Financial freedom doesn't equal freedom in every aspect of life. Bitcoin aims specifically at solving financial freedom, not to grant mankind freedom on doing whatever anyone pleases.
@_date: 2017-12-25 16:14:47
Thank goodness! Imagine if Satoshi was still around and started slinging his political ideas. That would be a huge obstacle for many to embrace Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-25 01:39:29
You implied LGBT "rights" are a good thing. Others disagree. My point is that what Antonopoulos embraced in his Twitter posts is controversial to a lot of people. Embedding these ideas in Bitcoin is therefore illogical if you want it to scale as much as possible.
@_date: 2017-12-25 02:56:44
I'm definitely not requesting Antonopoulos to be silenced. I just find it ineffective and unprofessional that he embeds his personal political ideas in his work on Bitcoin. He could've donated to Lambda Legal without being loud about it. But obviously he wanted to take advantage of his prominent position within the Bitcoin community to propagate for liberal politics. He can do that and I want him to have that right every day of the week. But it's probably not particularly good for scaling Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-25 00:46:20
It bothers me in the way that politics shift focus away from the product. Look at the insane criticism aimed at Vitalik Buterin for expressing his thoughts on that an unban on child pornography wouldn't be more controversial than an unban on heroin. Bitcoin Cash's CEO Rick Falkvinge has been marked for several political controversies aswell, which is a shame.
@_date: 2017-12-25 00:39:10
I don't think he should be restricted at all. He should feel free to publicly endorse whatever he wants. It's just that it won't go unnoticed. People really do take politics seriously. If the goal is to scale Bitcoin to as many as possible then it might be a good idea to separate his political ideas with his work on Bitcoin, specially at this early stage.
@_date: 2017-12-25 00:13:06
I totally agree. The point though is that promoting one's personal standpoints, specially political ones, can serve as an obstacle when trying to scale Bitcoin. Imagine if Antonpoulos was promoting bestiality instead of left-wing politics (I'm not putting them on par). That would certainly put a lot of people off.
@_date: 2017-12-25 01:36:00
Are you seriously arguing for that Bitcoin strives to legalize everything?
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:18:34
Yeah, because bashing the president of the U.S.A. and his administration and also donating and encouraging others to donate to a politically activate liberal organization is definitely not politics, right? Could it be that you're the one that doesn't understand politics?
@_date: 2017-12-25 02:24:37
I don't think he sold bombs. Atleast not from the information I've come across. IIRC he explained on the Rubin Report that he sold some sort of firecracker that wouldn't be harmful even if it blew in your hand.
@_date: 2017-12-25 00:34:39
Obviously. My point isn't that it's illogical to donate to organizations you embrace. The point is that it's probably bad advertisement to publicly support an organization that bashes the president of the U.S.A. and also supports ideas which many religious communities deem obscene.
@_date: 2017-12-25 01:23:22
I think it's a shame when people don't filter through political ideas. But a world without preconceptions is a utopia. That's why I think Bitcoin will fare best without having irrelevant political ideas embedded within it.
@_date: 2017-12-25 02:37:19
I agree. However, he's probably exlusively known for his work on Bitcoin. He'll definitely reach more people if he doesn't embedd political ideas into this.
@_date: 2017-12-25 02:28:49
Andreas publicly supports Lambda Legal which bashes the president of the U.S.A. and his administration for their stance on civil rights. Lambda Legal also has ambitions to change politics in favor of LGBTs. What the organization stands for is deemed obscene within religious Christianity and Islam for example.
@_date: 2017-12-25 02:41:16
Exactly. Since political ideas are such a sensitive topic, I would find it wise if Antonopoulos didn't propagate so hard for liberal ideas.
@_date: 2017-12-25 16:06:47
I encourage keeping political ideas at a distance from Bitcoin. I'm not saying that just liberal politics should be excluded.
@_date: 2017-12-25 16:25:48
Maybe that's why we'd fare better without such a shattering subject that politics is.
@_date: 2017-12-25 02:39:22
Sure. I assume you're referring to Bitcoin's ambitious goal to provide financial freedom to mankind. But how do liberal politics, such as LGBT adoption, come into the picture?
@_date: 2017-12-25 19:07:35
In most countries in Africa and in The Middle East same sex sexual relationships are penalized with jail time or even death. If the channels promoting Bitcoin also start advocating for same sex marriage, LGBT "rights", etc. then it will certainly serve as an obstacle for Africans and Arabs to embrace Bitcoin. Now, Antonopoulos didn't only advocate for these things, but he also bashed the president of the U.S.A. which wasn't very appreciated on his Twitter page. A world where people aren't offended by political or religious ideas is a utopia, and that's why I'd prefer them not to be advocated through the same channels Bitcoin is being promoted through. Specially considering Bitcoin is in such an early stage right now with so many issues.
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:16:01
Most of the world's population is against same sex sexual relationships. There's either law prohibiting it or it's unnatural in the culture. Even though it's not prohibited in the law in the U.S. or in Europe, there are still many against it, even though it could be that they're not in majority in the west.
@_date: 2017-12-25 00:20:12
I agree completely. Unfortunately a lot of people disregard what people have to say based on their political or religious beliefs. I see the possibility to scale Bitcoin as greater if political ideas were set aside.
