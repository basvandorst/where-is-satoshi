I am gonna try this.

Oh. You reverse engineered it yourself.

Same here. I liked what he typed. Currently, I have just started working, and have a job that pays really well. I am definitely in a position to buy some bitcoin without losing sleep if all that money is lost. I am not afraid of risks, but feel disappointed whenever some "opportunity" in investing passes by. But yeah, that guy is right. There will be many more opportunities. Just need to find some potential ones, do a shitload of research, and fucking invest! I feel that it is important not to overthink any investment decision. Do your research, and take the decision of buying something or not. It might be a wrong decision, but you gotta take it, right?

Deal with what?
@_date: 2017-07-09 07:49:06
Good find. But I don't think we can say anything conclusively based only on the usernames. Bitmain might own more than one usernames over there.

Damn. That was good to know.  
But my question was different. These "pools" have individual miners like you and me that might switch to a different mining pool. I mean,  
AntPool = Bitmain + (other individual miners)  
How much percentage of AntPool's ASICs are *owned* by Bitmain?
@_date: 2017-07-09 07:49:40
Okay, but how do I find out which of those "users and workers" are Bitmain?

Thank you. Was waiting from a long time for a reply.
@_date: 2017-07-07 08:02:47
Thank you. That is helpful, but I need the non-technical, "community" incidents that have happened too.
@_date: 2017-06-21 14:29:03
This was video where I, for the first time, *really* understood Bitcoin.

Dollar cost averaging is what I have started doing for the past month. I purchase a fixed amount of bitcoin every Monday at 12 pm. I bought some yesterday. :D
@_date: 2017-06-06 06:42:12
Same. Coz I wanna buy some more. Coz it's eventually gonna rise. Hopefully.

My personal advice (and this is *personal*, and in no way the *correct* advice): Don't.
1. Diversification is the preferred way of investing. What if Ethereum rises a lot tomorrow? You'll not be making those gains. What if Bitcoin falls, even if a bit, and Etheruem rises, even if a bit? You could have minimized your losses. My portfolio for example, has about 30% Bitcoin, 20% Litecoin, 25% Ethereum and 25% Monero. Note that I have not only bought different currencies, but also different *types* of currencies.
2. You don't want to buy an asset only because of the hype. Investigate and find out if the "intrinsic" price of an asset is close to the current market price. If the market price is too high, it will fall; if it's too low, it will rise. That's what they they mean when they say that the market is self-correcting. I know more about Bitcoin than most. I don't know enough about Ethereum, I feel. But I keep reading.
3. Very, very few people can predict how an asset will *exactly* behave in the future. And by "very few", I mean, probably Warren Buffet and maybe 5 other people in the world. Fun fact about Warren Buffet: He does not invest in technology stocks because he says he doesn't understand them. I consider Bitcoin to be one of the most advanced technologies of the time. So, people who believe they can correctly predict Bitcoin are just guessing. (I mean, there is nothing wrong with that. I am guessing too; I bought some Bitcoin in the past week.)
Consider all these facts, and maybe others, do your research, and make an informed decision based on them. Don't be emotional and scared of losing out on making gains. Be sure to write down your reasons on why you are selling Ethereum, if you are. Read and re-read those reasons, and make sure that they sound logical.
Best of luck!
An update: Monero, for example, has risen 13.38% since yesterday compared to Bitcoin's 9.91%. Litecoin has risen 3.91%, while Eth 3.66%. Such differential gains will keep happening.

This.  
That's why I asked for sources. So we can decide for ourselves how reliable the information/claims are.
@_date: 2017-06-15 11:14:05
I did. :P
@_date: 2017-06-05 18:22:46
Or use bitmixer.
@_date: 2017-06-06 09:08:14
Just don't forget about transaction charges. For such a small amount, they matter. My guess is you must have lost $4 to $5 when you converted your bitcoins to eth.
@_date: 2017-06-06 09:00:12
I don't.
Ideally, one would like buy it when it is at a temporary low. Or even better, when a bubble bursts. But I don't think I am skilled enough to identify a "temporary low". Or a bubble. (Is anyone?) And the market is unpredictable. What if you wait and the price keeps on going higher? What if you buy at your "temporary low" and the price keeps on going down?
The best you can do to offset this volatility is dollar cost averaging.

Chill, guys. You would have to be one in a million to predict that bitcoin would become this huge. You couldn't have possibly predicted it. Like then, I am sure that there other such investment opportunities today. And I don't mean only in cryptocurrencies. Look for the next Amazon IPO, the next Microsoft IPO, the next place to have a real-estate boom, the next business opportunity in the market. I am sure there are many.

Buddy. r/litecoin. :/
@_date: 2017-06-06 06:37:15
Wow. The latest one is from Dec. 15, 2010, titled "Why Bitcoin can’t be a currency", when the price of bitcoin was $0.23.

You had me with your above comments. Seemed to know like you knew what you were talking about, even if a little pessimistic. You lost me at "... but I'm quite certain I'm right".
