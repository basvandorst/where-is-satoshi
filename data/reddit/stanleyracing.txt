Why he is hiding and he is not here to clear his name?

he confirmed it in a presentation in front of 200 persons when asked directly whether Neo lost any coins from Mt.Cox
he said "the company has not lost a single coin from the Mt.Cox fiasko. These are old generation BTC businesses, we are the new generation, we are professional and people can trust us"
So cut the crab.

You have a lot of explaining to do.

Very good excuse for running away with thousands of people's coins.

the "unofficial explanation" given today in the Bitcointalk forum from either him under a pseudonym or somebody close to him, is that he received "threats" that appeared in the forum on the 26th of March...
hhmm... very good excuse actually..going silent and running away since the 18th of March for "threats" received on the 26th is actually a very good excuse for running away with thousands of people's coins!

"Cypriot police was looking for Danny to get his statement"
Yeap. This if why arrest warrants are issued and not for (according to the press office of the Cyprus Police):
THEFT, FRAUD, COUNTERFEITING, FORGERY, MONEY LAUNDERING.
Do you know how many years you'll get for that Dannyboy?
Our congratulations to the CYPRUS POLICE. We are sure you will bring him to justice. Justice will be done.

Thanks for the timeline and the summary man.
Brewster is on the WANTED list of many people. He screwed up hundreds of investors, employees, creditors etc.
