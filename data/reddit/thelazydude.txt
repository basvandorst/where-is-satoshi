Well shit... you're right.. I totally freaked out, it's the only bitcoin app on the phone, now back home was going to buy like crazy.

True. I barely look at the price though - the App sends me a notification as soon as Bitcoin goes up or down more than 20%.. and it seemed like that happened. What are the other things you observe, that are important to you, concerning Bitcoin?

Great work! Keep it up! This is a genius way to get people to learn more about Bitcoin, just like that other person making a Monopoly version with Bitcoin.

Not really answering your question, but if you are new to crypto do these 3 things after buying your first bitcoin:
1. Buy a hardware wallet (ledger nano s, trezor or keepkey), to keep it safe.
2. Transfer your bitcoin to your personal hardware wallet.
3. Wait a few years. Profit.
Also diversify into other promising cryptos..

Check this out: 
Just scroll down to "Bitcoin price per weekday", select "USD all time" and deselect "Euro last month". It seems like Sunday is the lowest price. The graph below shows the average "Bitcoin price per hour" - lowest price at noon in US, evening in Europe and early morning in Asia.
But trying to determine when to buy or sell Bitcoin during the week/hour is useless, because in the last month Thursday was the cheapest day and Sunday the most "expensive" - so you shouldn't try that IMO. Also I don't know how reliable those charts are.
