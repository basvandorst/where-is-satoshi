One of the payment options is Bitcoin. They are pretty backed up right now because of how many preorders they got. If you order now, the order will probably come in January.

They would lose 3% anyway if we paid with a credit card. They are just sending the savings back to us to increase use of their app, if I understand correctly.

Is there anyone that would be credible enough to institute such an awareness day?

The way I eventually worked it out:
I signed up for a Dwolla account and sent $ USD to Dwolla from my bank account. This took about 4-5 days for the funds to arrive. 
I then signed up for a Campbx.com account and used that to purchase bitcoins through Dwolla.

It's cheap. It's quick.

I haven't really gone all-out meal replacement yet. I still eat regular meals with friends and family pretty often. Its more a thing of convenience when I'm at work or need to head out the door quick in the morning. I'd say I'm certainly more productive, but that might just because of saving time. I've always avoided foods that I notice make me feel groggy so I'm not sure I would notice a huge difference. At some point I'll try a Soylent-only diet for a few weeks just to see, but I find regular meals a big part of social interaction so I'm inconsistent depending on the circumstances.

The brand-name soylent, it arrives in the next week or so. Though I've used other similar/more expensive products that I really appreciated for the sake of convenience.

I'm excited that I've found something that I want to use my bitcoins to buy! My first bitcoin purchase other than bitcointip!
@_date: 2013-10-12 19:34:37
I buy my orders of soylent with them

Thanks, I just don't feel like giving out all my personal info just to donate. For now i'll just give you a bitcointip:
+bitcointip $2

... hmm ... I really don't care about these sort of things, but if it's worth $50 then I need to check out this RES thing...

Could you put up a QR code for donations? I keep my spending wallet on my phone and it's really hard to type in all the letters for an address.
