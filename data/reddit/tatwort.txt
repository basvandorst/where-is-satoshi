Ah, you're my personal hero for today. That saved me a lot....

My main concern: That this leads to further centralization. Just imagine that there is one single chip-producer who implements it first: He'll basically would be able to get the mining business in his hands for a long time, especially after the halving takes place.
Secondly: The whitepaper doesn't specify how the software will be distributed amongst pools. If, at the end of the day, only big pools can afford this, some smaller pools will be squeezed out of the business.
As long as Timo doesn't specify how he wants to licence this model, I consider this as risky.

It's the one from Bitcoin-not-bombs. Funny sidestory. A pilote once asked me what plane this is for he thought I am a plane-lover. I told him that I have no idea but it is about Bitcoin. So he, too, was becoming very interested. At the end of the day, it turned out that he is head of the local chapter of ACFE (Association of Certifided Fraud Examiners) and he invited me for a talk there. One of the attendants is working at the national tax authority, therefore, I received just a couple of days ago an invitation to explain Bitcoin and the Blockchain to them.
At the end of the day, I see a lot of interest, but few knowledge. I had to find a way how to explain Bitcoin in a way that non-technical people understand it and remember it. Maybe I should write it down one day as an example...

But isn't Satoshi a time traveller anyway? I mean: The pdf on bitcoin.org was created 2009:03:24 11:33:15-06:00. But it was posted in the Internet in November 2008. So Satoshi is above time...

Wish it were like this. But the really funny part was that the old guy said that he still does online banking, but his son told him to use a Ubuntu Live-CD to do this.... that really made my day...

I'm self employed, and last time I checked, I had a different name :-)

No, I'm a client with this bank since a while. When I left (I really HAD to buy some Christmas stuff before the shops closed, otherwise my wife would kill me today...) he asked me if he could contact me if he had some additional questions. I told him he can, using my contacts they have on file.
I run a small firm which is Bitcoin related, and when I established this firm, I needed a bank account. The people at this bank were interested, but declined to open an account because they were afraid of all the compliance. They thought they are just too small.
About three months ago, I sold privately some comic books in the US. The buyer tried to send me money to my Swiss account. However, it bounced back several times. Obviously, sending money from the US to Switzerland is sometimes rocket science. So the client finally sent me a check. But it is almost impossible to cash this in in Switzerland. "My" bank was not able to cash it in, too - they would have to send the check back to the US, cash it in through a corresponding bank - which they do not have - and charge a fee of more than 400 US$ for all the work.

It is a small bank, and all my contact details are on file there. For example: I don't have a banking card, but people happen to know their clients. It really is a great bank, thus very small and familiar.

Is Brock indeed a "strategic advisor" to Neucoin - which looks more like a scam than anything else? If so, I doubt that people like Brock really can change anything to good in the Bitcoin Foundation...

Thanks, dude. Just returning from my mine, and yeah, it was dry as hell... so the beer is very welcome!

Yeah, from time to time, mainly their ATM at Kafi Schoffel...

Yeah, have seen this, but it works with giving fake data.... However, here's the main text of the homepage:
Taking a novel approach to fostering startups, nexuslab introduces a programme inspired by the blockchain paradigms of decentralisation, trust and efficiency. To extend the range and expertise of its mentor network, the programme will collaborate with Startupbootcamp Fintech.
nexuslab will host its three-month programme, which will take place in a predominantly virtual setting based on a secure collaboration platform to facilitate tailored coaching sessions and offer on-demand training. Three weekend hangout sessions in major European cities will provide founders of participating startups with the opportunity to meet face-to-face and learn directly from successful fintech companies. Throughout the program, the start-ups will be individually matched with senior level mentors and financial services experts to receive practical advice on regulatory, technical and commercial aspects of their specific business. nexuslab will collaborate with Startupbootcamp Fintech to provide participants access to selected experts and build on Startupbootcamp’s experience of helping and growing startups. During the final month of the programme, all teams will gather at the nexuslab pop-up lab in Zurich for additional in-person mentoring and to prepare their ideas for a pitch day.
nexuslab will consider applications both from teams with convincing early-stage ideas and startups that have already acquired seed funding. At least one of the founders needs to be based in Europe. nexuslab is open to fintech ventures with business models based on or related to blockchain technology. The programme features three tollgates at which a decision will be made whether a team will progress to the next stage. This built-in selection mechanism allows nexuslab to start with a larger pool of teams and give entrepreneurs with early-stage ideas a chance to prove themselves.
The first round of nexuslab will start in March, 2016 and we will not take equity from pilot group participants.
Application is open now!

They still wait who will pay them more for a story...

As a matter of facts, this would also mean that Bitcoin basically will become fully legal and constitutional in Switzerland.

It is time now to reveal: I'm Jean-Paul Sartre. And I must say: Wright NEVER signed one of my messages.

I don't know in which world you are living in...


This is like saying: There are webbased Bitcoin-wallets, so why would we need a wallet on our computer...
In times of NSA and others snooping on all communication, it is more than ever necessary that you use a client which you can configure according to your needs.


Well, because I'd like to see a wallet implementation which would enable these people to use it as simple as e-mail. It is not about burden or making money with it - it is about making it easier to spread Bitcoin on the world.

Sounds a bit fishy... Lawsuits are pending, and boom - they go bankrupt. Nice planning....
