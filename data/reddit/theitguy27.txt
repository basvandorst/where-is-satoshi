I feel like that would have a negative effect on the banks though.

The market cap would soar if this happened. Everyone would feel like they could own a 'whole' one and would buy in.

I believe he himself recently said he is not

He's a fucking idiot. He just said it's cause of him that Andreas is a millionaire now. While that may be true, what kinda sociopath is this guy. How could anyone ever want to follow his lead

Im currently experiencing the same issues. Its terrible. Ive been using them for a while but havent had an issue up until now. Did you ever get a resolution?
@_date: 2017-12-18 15:38:43
While this is a cool website, this definitely is not an accurate reflection of BTC lost.
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:27:53
Yeah and there will be flying cars and hover boards

Why do I always click on these...
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:45:16
By doing that they are also pumping up the price and causing more and more people to talk about bitcoin. To the point where they are trying to get in on the action and sign up at Coinbase, causing it to crash earlier today. Bitcoin is already viewed as a stored asset, so to me the price going up encourages people to hold on. 
I get what your saying, but just saying it could have negative implications that the banks didn't anticipate.

That’s great news. Thanks for relaying the message!
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:52:08
I wish the fad was to donate bitcoin to me :(
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:48:52
Ah, so you're saying the banks bought in a while ago, gotcha. Thought you meant more of a quick pump and dump, like whats seemingly been occurring over the last few days.

I have my BTC in breadwallet. Am I at risk of losing my BTC at all? I am waiting on my Ledger Nano to come in but is back ordered it seems.
@_date: 2017-08-21 02:24:03


Would you recommend moving them to a hardware/desktop wallet?
@_date: 2017-08-29 23:02:12
Appreciate it boss
@_date: 2017-08-19 17:16:14
We need more people like your in this world. Maybe it wouldn't be such a bad place after all?
@_date: 2017-11-14 05:40:20
What is this dip you speak of
@_date: 2017-11-14 03:39:00
Wouldn't the analogy be more like owning a McDonald's while owning a Burger King right across the street? You'll be competing with yourself.

Ill be looking around for a tall building if this is the case.
@_date: 2017-11-11 03:22:23
What address do I need to put into this to see my info? I copied the link and put in my bitcoin wallet's (ledger nano) receive address and it said I too had 0 transactions and a 0 balance. I clearly see my balance in my account.
@_date: 2017-11-15 02:55:33
ASAP, unless the fees are super high. In which case I will wait it out a little bit.
@_date: 2017-11-17 03:48:02
Yes. There should be no more responses necessary.
@_date: 2017-11-11 15:59:44
You're absolutely right. Thanks man!
@_date: 2017-11-12 02:07:00
Edit: Scratch that
@_date: 2017-11-12 02:02:37
You can buy BCH on Breadwallet? or are you just storing on Bread? 
@_date: 2017-11-12 04:12:28
I see. I guess I’m thinking of when I buy bitcoin on breadwallet. The more I purchase, the higher my fees. I just assumed that’s how it was. Apologies!
@_date: 2017-11-12 02:02:25
Have you us ed shapeshift? Been trying all day but have been having issues. If so, what were the fees like?
@_date: 2017-11-07 04:36:08
bitcoinity.org ftw

Was it your favorite before or after you saw this machine?
@_date: 2017-10-06 18:28:14
Isn’t it like getting free coins if they give you both? Why wouldn’t you want to do that? Sorry, super confused by this part. Say I have 4 bitcoin. I now have 4 bitcoin and 4 of the new coin, no? 
@_date: 2017-10-25 05:12:20
Probably due to price drop with everyone wigging out
