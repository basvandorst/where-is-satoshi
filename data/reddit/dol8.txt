i'm sorry if i sound stupid, i'm a nub and i'm trying to learn. 
i mean if you don't own the bitcoin then why even buy it from there when one can have it in their own wallet?

@_date: 2017-12-17 06:04:19

@_date: 2017-12-17 06:07:02
what do you mean by investments? 
like buying a shit ton and saving them and hoping for the best? 
@_date: 2017-12-17 00:28:56
wait so if you don't own your coins on coibase, what is the point? 
@_date: 2017-12-18 18:54:11

@_date: 2017-12-17 01:23:27
but then what is the point in buying on coinbase? 
@_date: 2017-12-18 18:43:28
