theres literally nothing you have to varify manually for tier 1 and 2 so a bunch of retarded anythings would do it infinitely faster because you shouldnt need to do anything at all. besides, kraken isnt some small shitty startup, theyre one of the most popular websites out there, if smaller websites can do it in less than 24 hours then i really dont see any excuses for a week+ for tier 1 and 2 besides incompetence

you still didnt anwer anything i said. youre welcome to defend their 3 week "identification process" any time you want or you can just keep yelling the same shit youve been yelling for the past 3 replies about no one else understanding the delicate and really complex subject of auto-identification, which is somehow used by everyone else except kraken

my frame of reference is literally any other website that asks for identification, and sure, i could get a delay on passports or soemething with a small startup, but they literally took a fucking week to verify tier 1. TIER FUCKING ONE. what verification do you suspect they did? did they google my country to make sure it exists? did they check my name or facebook? did they count the years on their fingers to make sure im over 18? they didnt call or message my phone though, so maybe they should take another week to verify it.
it the first time i see a company be so slow, and then have enough balls to ask for extra money with the transactions with such shitty service (pretty convenient of them to instantly lower it back again after they got so much shit for it isnt it? its almost like it wasnt necessary at all)
oh and by the way, please fuck off with the small startup shit ok? its 6 years old and im pretty sure you cant call a company a startup anymore when it has already bought 4 other startups

"oh shit some valid criticism, i know what to do, i guess ill just repeat the same empty response that answers literally nothing over and over again"
if youre too retarded to actaully read what i said, i can sum it up for you
my frame of reference: other companies that actually offer a service they promise to offer.
a company that already bought 4 other small startups is not a small startup anymore.
expecting something that a website promises is not unreasonable

i assumed they werent, but i guess that proves  my point even further. if a small shitty startup can become one of the most popular websites even if they take literally weeks to complete tasks that any other webiste does instantly then the bitcoin market as a whole is still small as fuck
@_date: 2017-06-08 19:03:46
is the bitcoin market really that small? i mean kraken is supposed to be a big website right? and im pretty sure a bunch retarded monkeys could do the verifications faster, why does everyone put up with this shit?
@_date: 2017-06-22 17:16:02
you are extremely correct, i dont care at all. as long as they take literally weeks to do something any other company does intantly because it doesnt even need any actual manual oversight then their system, waiting list or whatever the fuck else you come up with as an excuse doesnt matter at all
