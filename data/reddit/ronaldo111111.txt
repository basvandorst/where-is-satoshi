Unfortunately the reality

It is the same as to go out to distribute $ 6000 to unknown people, and to expect that they will bring $ 150,000 in 5 years.

When I did not understand this , I would think that this is my negligence or lack of knowledge , it's not so , in fact , if all currencies fall below 90%, the question arises, where did the money go and when they will return at least 1:1 not to mention the profits . This is the answer someone took them and demands that they would be sold for a miser, except for the exchange no one else. Exchange spies on you and selects the time,
when you are left without anything, moreover, the whole network is viewed and until there is 1% - up to 5% in dollars the amount that can be distributed , such as profit , the entire network will hang minus 90% to go to the next cycle with a profit in the trend reversal . Same story with mining , what would people buy expensive equipment cards and Asimov again ???? where the money goes ????? again, there and again minus 90% because at the normal price they will not sell the cost of the cutter, etc . In the end, gradually you are ready, for that would drive the money in Fiat and again the cycle is repeated , and the money is not and will not even those that you gave. If you ever lucky , then soon someone will roll the other way . Not much to criticize . After the publication in all the media that the crypt will soon be gone, one second passed and on the Internet all the media disappeared with this news.

Greed and self-conceit also begets nonsense
