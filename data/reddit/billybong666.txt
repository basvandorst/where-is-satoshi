How much do you have to pay for a transaction fee that's confirmed in 10 min?  Thousands of dollars? 
I have been paying the "regular" fee, ranging from 5-20 USD.  The screen says "estimated confirmation time, 1+ hr" .....   
And yet, I have had no confirmation for weeks. 
In years of using BTC, I have never seen transactions take weeks.

I am curious, myself. When I google "local bitcoin atm", a cardtronic ATM appears on google maps at my local supermarket.  In fact the majority of bitcoin atms that appear on my local map are cardtronics atms.  I don't think they'll really support it, but I plan to go and find out for myself very soon.

This transaction was set at 60sat/B, the "regular" fee on blockchain. 22411fd381bd99d6606aa5692e25bfa99230a0b0e3a33649b58fa1e77b5ccd28     
This was sent a few days ago, still 0/3. 
This next one was much more expensive, and I customized the fee to 700sat/B. I sent it one hour ago; 0/3.

On the blockchain website, it will give three options for a transaction fee:  "regular", "priority",  or "customize".
So, yes there actually is a "regular" fee.   I usually choose regular, but sometimes I use priority or customize a fee.  
Most recently, I have set the fee at a higher rate than the priority fee. 
I set the transaction at about 700 sat/B, for about 25 USD.  Still no confirmation.
