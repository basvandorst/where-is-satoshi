"Ossified" - what a great term for this phenomenon he describes in computer science.
@_date: 2014-05-14 13:43:48
If you think that is true you're going to hate bitcoin.  
Actually the liquidity trap you cite is exacerbated by fractional reserve banking which was institutionalized in 1913.  The money multiplier effect causes small amounts of "hoarding" create large drops in the money supply. The gold standard was "abandoned" because JP Morgan and the banking cartel got the Federal Reserve created to be a lender of last resort and bail them out during bank runs on their fractional reserves.
An honest banking system is based on 100% proof of reserves, and bitcoin is the first time in human history that these reserves can be instantly verified worldwide.

Escrow services using multisignature wallets (a built-in feature in bitcoin) is going to be the answer here.  Then, 2/3 parties are required to make the transaction occur.  An arbiter like ebay or amazon could make the decision about who gets the money, just like with credit cards or paypal.

Loans are taken from central banks by commercial banks, who loan it to consumers.
If ALL the debt was paid, there would be almost no money in circulation(besides that which existed under the gold standard).  This is how fractional reserve banking works. 
The monetary base is created as a loan by the central bank to commercial banks.  Here's an example using the 10% reserve requirement banks have today:
Central bank creates $100 dollars in its electronic ledger to loan out to bank A.  Bank A loans $100 to a customer for a mortgage, and he gives the house seller $100.  The house seller deposits $100 in his bank, Bank B.  Now Bank B can loan $90 to a new customer, and that customer pays for another house/car/tv, and that the new person puts $90 into bank C.  Now bank C can loan out $81 dollars, and so on.  
If everyone pays their banks back, and no one wants a loan, then the banks have to pay the last$ 100 back to the central bank.  No money in circulation.

Once complete, you will need to answer questions regarding your use of BitInstant at any time in the last 2 years, declare the number of bitcoins you own in other exchanges, when they were purchased, personal porn viewing habits, and under penalty of perjury, attest that you have not, and will not ever insult Mark Karpeles, belittle his beverage consumption habits, speak ill of the Mt.

However, I think the precise numbers of specie in the system are irrelevant.  To me, the most important part is that those numbers are immune from corruption and political influence.  In my opinion, no central bank will ever be able to achieve this, "absolute power corrupting absolutely" and such.  Giving freshly printed dollars to a particular class of individuals year after year for a century creates the 1%-99% kind of dichotomy seen today. 
I believe a hard protocol is the best way to avoid the pitfalls of poor central economic planning.  If the length of the meter remains the same, year after year, engineers can keep building bridges.  As long as entrepreneurs, investors, savers, and spenders have a clear idea of how much their currency will be worth in the future (whether gently deflationary or inflationary) significant economic depressions can be avoided.  
Fortunately, bitcoin has given the world a choice - to keep existing traditional currencies and their electronic transfer methods, or bitcoin.  Ultimately, the market will decide between government currencies and cryptocurrencies as the new "gold standard" of monies.

People think they're ready for the drops because they've seen them in the price history.  Then they get 5 months of bad news, and they're ready to abandon ship.  We've heard many, many calls for the death of bitcoin, and the ecosystem didn't have 1/10th the capability it has now.  
The price dropped from $38 to $2 for a reason: people thought they would be totally worthless.  The price dropped from $250 to $90 because people thought it would be totally worthless.  Now people are realizing again, "hey it really could be totally worthless".  Same type of people get shaken out each time - weak hands.
It ain't a sure thing, but the stakes are huge.  If you bought in at $1000, I'm sorry for your paper losses.  But if there's a 10% chance this thing could have the market cap of gold, it's worth the risk to me to keep a small portion of my assets in the protocol.

I'm aware of Gresham's law.  That applies generally to two forms of the same money, silver coins vs zinc coins with the same face value.  But note my caveat.  In a free market, people will prefer to accept sound money.  Over time, currencies that do not hold their value will be rejected.  For example, the Zimbabwean dollar.  Few people were willing to accept them, so the currency was completely abandoned in 2009.  I believe all fiat currency is headed this way.

If you buy a bitcoin from someone, this usually means they are sending a coin from their wallet to your wallet (wallet creation is very easy, many programs will do it for you).  This is the safest way to buy a coin.  If you're buying a paper wallet (A written private key, like a casascius coin), they are transferring you control of a wallet they own.  You must trust that they don't keep a copy of the private key.  Whoever knows the private key can spend the coins, the bitcoin network doesn't care if zero or one or a million people know the key.  The first one to enter the private key in a transaction can do whatever they want with the coins.

Money printing is a form of taxation.  It allows the government to tax without a direct levy anyone who holds the currency.  Regardless of government intentions, inflation of the money supply hurts low income wage earners who must pay higher prices year after year, even if their wages won't increase. The middle class must enter the finance market to save their wealth over the long term, rather than just save money, as was possible in the age before fractional reserve banking.  Money printing allows governments to spend significantly beyond what the electorate would allow (Iraq would never have happened if government had to raise the revenue through added tax).  This has allowed big government and empire building that is not possible without control of the money supply.

I believe Litecoin will gain advantage when high finance gets involved and uses cryptos to back their inter-institutional transactions.  Eventually high finance may create its own altcoins to suite their specific needs.  
But initially, I think finance will prefer litecoin to bitcoin for accounts settlement.  The 10 minute generation time means that there are bitcoin aberrations where 30 minute or even 60 minutes occur without a block.  If no block has been mined, you don't own those new coins, period.  Those are very long periods of time in the financial world, eternities really.
In litecoin, the odds of even a 30 min period without a block are very low, 1 in 4,096.  In bitcoin, those odds are 1 in 8.  
I understand the knee jerk reaction to reject altcoins (As a majority bitcoin holder, I was skeptical initially), but honestly the only thing bitcoin has on litecoin is history.  But gold and paper money have a lot of history too.  It is no protection against their obsolescence.

My point is, Bitcoin as a currency, if widely adopted, will radically reduce the size and scope of states worldwide.  The ability to transact privately with other individuals without any 3rd party's knowledge will make taxation and wealth forfeiture difficult.  Furthermore, most states use money printing (inflation) as a way to surreptitiously tax savers and wage earners.  This form of taxation will also become obsolete. Less government revenue + no money printing = austerity.

Say your funds are tied up in transfer.  There's a market meltdown, but you can't re-spend your funds while you wait for a confirmation.  Suppose there is a black swan kind of event, where the is major market turmoil during a freak 90 minute interval between blocks (in bitcoin the odds of this occuring are 1 in 512).  Sure, those funds are coming.  But you cannot respend them until the blockchain knows you own the coins.
The odds of a 90 minute period with no litecoin blocks are 1 in ~69 million.

I'm no developer, but had this idea:
TweetCoin: Each "transaction" in the "blockfeed" could be a tweet.  Bitcoin already has an overlay to allow embedded messages in a transaction.  People would pay to tweet with tweetcoins, they would likely be very cheap or easy to mine on your own. You could send a tweet without a coin recipient, with just a transaction fee that went to miners who published your tweet in the blockfeed.  The transaction fee would pay people who mine to keep the blockfeed secured and up to date, and people could buy or mine tweetcoins with which to make tweets.  Rather than be limited, there could be an infinite number of tweetcoins available to mined.  Tweetcoins would make tweets cheap to send, but not so cheap that people would spam the network with dust.  People would probably end up paying a few dollars a year, but there'd be no censorship.

Question 1: Yes, your private key controls the wallet, not the file on your computer. You will be able to wipe the wallet into your Blockchain.info wallet using the private key alone.
Question 2: Create a new wallet / key pair, send the money to the new address on electrum.  If there is no rush, use no fee, and it'll come within a few days.  Wiping a wallet into electrum prevents you from recovering those funds with the electrum seed if your computer crashes, so I don't recommend it.

One thing that could really take the wind out of litecoin is a fork in bitcoin to reduce block rewards and generation time by 75%
Litecoin really is better for person to person transactions.  Everyone wants to see that one confirm happen, and the odds of it not happening for half an hour are pretty large in bitcoin, 1 in 8.  For litecoin, these odds are 1 in 4096.

There is no form of money that ever started out in a homogeneous distribution among all people.  Someone tends to start out with a lot, and they have the job of marketing their money as a means of universal exchange.  Gold, dollars, silver, beads, bitcoins, litecoins, whatever.
Having said that, the market will decide on this one.  Altcoins could become popular to avoid the potential volatility of one person having a huge effect on liquidity down the road.
In my opinion worrying too much about this is falling into the envy trap.  Either the money is useful at the price you pay, or it isn't.  Don't spend your life worrying about how much other people have in their bank accounts.

My personal opinion is that with the inevitable self-destruction of fiat currencies, there will be races to the exits for different forms of currencies.  We saw this in Cyprus, where a tax haven country was forced to devalue bank accounts (bank levy) to pay for bank insolvencies.    This small default caused a significant spike in bitcoin value, and even now the market cap is only 2 billion USFRNs ($).  I'm speculating that bitcoin will reach reach gold parity within 3 years.  Within 10 years, the dollar sign on keyboards will be replaced with the bitcoin sign. When inflation is repatriated to the United States and the value of the dollar drops precipitously, it may go higher, much higher.  Or could be worth nothing.  If it were a sure thing, I'd put every penny I had in it.

2.5 minutes is a big improvement, and bitcoin could actually be really improved by adopting it with a hard fork.  10 minutes made sense when there were just a few nodes on the network.  Now, I think it's obsolete on such a mature network.  When bitcoin addresses its massive block generation time, I'll be trading my LTC in.  Until then, I believe LTC is the better protocol.
That first confirmation is important to verifying the transaction, and the odds of it taking 30 minutes with bitcoin are orders of magnitude higher than litecoin.
@_date: 2013-11-14 02:34:02
In some way, you're missing the point.  There is no coin. There is only a publicly held ledger (call the *blockchain*) of which *wallet* owns how many *coins*.  The owner of the wallet is a person who knows the "secret code" associated with a particular wallet.  This secret code, called a *Private Key*, is what allows the bitcoin network to accept a transaction from a particular wallet.  The wallet address is public information, the private key is a secret code that allows you to send the coins to another wallet.
This private key can be kept anywhere until such time as you want to spend your coins.  But you must keep it secret, and safe from destruction.  A physical thing that represents a Private key might be a scrap of paper with the Private key written on it.  This is a security method used by many bitcoin owners to protect their wallet from online hacking.  But there must be no digital version of this private key to be certain that it can't be hacked.  Casascius coin could contain a prviate key, but then you must trust the person that sent it to you doesn't have a copy of the key too.  Much safer to generate your own keys and skip the coin part altogether.

I was under the impression that a 51% attack gets harder with litecoin.  Suppose you want to be sure the securities or stocks you sold for bitcoin doesn't get double spent.  You make sure to wait for 60 minutes.  Assuming average generation times, A 51% attacker must get 6 blocks in a row on bitcoin to fool you after 1 hour.  These odds are 1 in 64.  A litecoin 51% attacker must get 24 blocks in a row, odds of which are 1 in 16.8 million.  Am I wrong?

They want that sweet DHS cash to create a fucking sniffing tool.  If they want to change the blockchain, no one will touch their fork with a ten inch pole.  If they want to create a database that analyzes the blockchain, there's not much anyone can do to stop it.  The question is, who would willingly give up personal information to associate a wallet.  I suppose legislation will force companies like Coinbase to get this information from users.  The question is, can we get people to use bitcoin without fiat convertibility before the Feds can stop said convertability.
