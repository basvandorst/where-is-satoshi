Hey, you might get in touch with Bitwala, they are open for business and issue cards with an excellent EUR/XBT rate.
@_date: 2015-12-10 15:33:59
works for me.
@_date: 2015-06-30 11:27:09
save some of your coins, Bitwala does the same for a 0.5 % fee --&gt; 
@_date: 2015-06-08 13:13:44
not everybody has (access to) a bank account, your accounts might be frozen or empty. there are people living abroad or traveling without being able to send money or want do to cheaper and faster transactions without one-time or setup costs
@_date: 2015-12-10 15:34:14
what is bad about it?
@_date: 2015-12-10 17:50:57
Okay. I think Bitwala offers to order and top up the card in bitcoin. with their European and international wires in different currencies you basically do not need a fiat bank account anymore. if it comes to finance and technology not everybody wants to be a master of slaves but everybody wants to master his own money easy and fast

all4btc.com - a global shopping service for ebay, amazon and anything else.
@_date: 2014-04-15 11:37:37
For Europe you could buy using all4btc.com anything from bitcoin-non-accepting retailer, especially from Amazon.de &amp; co.uk or Ebay etc. You could easily buy gift cards, as well.

I recommend using Bitwala ( They offer the fastest way to cash out Bitcoin into Euro and all other European currencies while charging the lowest fee on the market (0.5 %)
@_date: 2016-01-03 09:23:38
For EUR the best choice is  (cheap, fast and reliable)
@_date: 2016-11-17 12:52:16
Yeah, pretty convenient. Love it, too
@_date: 2016-11-18 10:16:24
I was waiting for that one long time, so it finally arrived, makes me really happy. Gonna test it out right away and report. I think living now 100% on bitcoin is much easier using a hybrid solution like Bitwala for everyday. This is the way to go currently because Euros and Dollars are not going to disappear quickly...

Greek is not like everything is blocked, they are still different payment methods available, may just limited. You can buy bitcoin with localbitcoins.com for cash, some people own bitcoin and can sell them to use services e.g. Bitwala or All4btc to send money abroad or to shop online. You can transfer good, services and values in return for bitcoin... it depends on your creativity and effort. And if you follow the news from European bitcoin companies - they are Greek users doing that and making it possible for their friends as well.

I can see only bitcoin companies here and some blockchain startups but no litecoin yet :) greetings from Berlin.

5 EUR for a physical or virtual bitcoin debit card is really cheap, most of the banks in Europe are charging many time over that price. it is possible to get a virtual debit card and start shopping online within one business day, that is actually pretty cool.
@_date: 2015-07-10 07:11:10
Good job.
@_date: 2016-02-03 19:21:44
right, that is the point.
@_date: 2016-02-03 15:26:01
how you come up with their website? this company does not offer any debit cards
@_date: 2016-02-03 19:21:15
it is faster, less registration &amp; account setup is required and very often cheaper. also you need a bank and an exchange account
@_date: 2015-10-21 18:22:52
 is a faster and cheaper alternative to cash out your bitcoin in Euro
@_date: 2015-02-06 13:57:25
The general pricing is not transparent without the display of the API / real time rates of the BTC / EUR exchange prices e.g. like bitpay.com/bitcoin-exchange-rates - Could your offer that to proof the non-existence of hidden fees?

If you are from Europe, the bill payment service bitwala recently opened up -  to cover all your fiat and paper invoices by using bitcoin. It is a 2 EUR or 2 % fee on each transaction and works within one business day
