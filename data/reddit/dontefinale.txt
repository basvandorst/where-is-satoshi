Posting about faucets is against the rules on this subreddit.  I also don't know of any myself that I can suggest.  
@_date: 2018-01-06 07:16:57
Just a promotion to get users to join.  Fees will be added
@_date: 2018-01-01 08:29:47
To add to this, when you sell you will pay capital gains on the entire amount, even if the price of bitcoin goes down from when you got it.  your cost basis for the bitcoin you received is 0, so ou have to pay taxes on all of it.  But only when you sell.  Hold forever, never pay taxes.   
@_date: 2018-01-04 19:46:10
Greetings chillip135, Your assumption is correct.  The fee (96 sat/b)  is too low for the current backlog and so your transaction is being ignored by the miners for transactions with higher fees.  


No it is not.  Its in the mempool, if it was in the blockchainm it would be confirmed at this time :)  
You'll have to wait for the mempool to clear out, or try to accelerate it with a service like viaBTC, or paid accelerator services (I have no experience with these, so I can not help you or suggest any)  
@_date: 2018-01-01 08:11:03
When price goes up like crazy there will be meme posts everywhere.  Only the mods can stop it from getting crazy like that.  But it is nice seeing technical posts returning to this sub.
@_date: 2018-01-04 19:08:38
using this, you might be waiting for a very long time.  its claiming anywhere between 3 block and infinity blocks which is not a good sign.  
You can hope the transaction volume goes down, or you can try a fee accelerator service like viaBTC offers.  
@_date: 2018-01-04 19:10:58
I wish you luck on getting it in then!  I haven't been lucky with the recently.  However I'm also not sending bitcoin that much either thankfully.  Just trying to help other people.

Send a small amount first, just to be safe

So she didn't like it, or liked it so much she didn't want to share.
@_date: 2018-01-13 17:03:16
They didn't mention mining, but for their audience I think that was a wise choice.  Overall was a great ep.
@_date: 2018-01-28 19:03:50
You will be by locked into what ever the market price is at that time, subject to slippage.
I'd suggest using be limit orders, no fees.

Question, any way to set a alert when a wallet address value changes?
@_date: 2018-01-29 15:40:52
Nice app op. I've been looking for a wallet address tracker that works for a few currencies.  
@_date: 2018-01-04 18:52:56
No.  You want a Faucet of some sort, but even then your getting pennies a day if your lucky.  
Anything that is free will either be a scam, or very very slow.  
@_date: 2018-01-04 00:03:37
Actually if it's a gift you inherit the cost basis The Giver had.  So i was wrong.
But I'm curious, are you saying they're going to start taxing losing trades? Because that doesn't make much sense.  
@_date: 2018-01-04 18:51:09
This is solid advice.  I've also had great success with ViaBTC
While I have you friend, do you know the minimum fee value viaBTC will accelerate for free?  I know they have a lower limit set I just don't know it.  
@_date: 2018-01-04 00:32:05
Even coin to coin is taxable before this new bill.  
But check with a accountant to be sure.
@_date: 2018-01-04 19:03:25
npnp!  I know how hard it is to get one accepted these days.  Hope you had some success! 
@_date: 2018-01-28 19:35:38
They both have their up and downs.
If you want your order filled right now and you don't mind the fee, market orders are perfect for you.
If you want a specific price with no fees and don't mind waiting, limit orders are fine.  
It's really up to the person :)
@_date: 2018-01-08 05:37:58
10/10 would get hacked again.
@_date: 2018-01-28 20:00:50
Due to easier / harder fiat on and off Ramps.
Also due to fiat or crypto flowing into the exchange.

ViaBTC has a min fee required. I think 20 sat/b is too low.  
@_date: 2018-01-28 20:50:56
Rather that, if it's a large amount at least, than potentially making a mistake and losing it all.  But I'm paranoid.
@_date: 2018-01-04 19:38:37
Yes, but different amounts.  Its because you had a Bcash balance at the time of the fork in August.  
@_date: 2018-01-02 04:54:22
I'm sure those things are hard to keep fueled is all. 
@_date: 2018-01-28 19:55:10
Total fees paid is only one part of the information we need to help.  Could you post the transaction ID?

A lot of hope actually with the mempool finally getting to reasonable levels.  Your in luck that there is one more holiday before business comes back on the 2nd
@_date: 2018-01-04 15:32:03
If your asking about trading just between the crypto trading pairs, you can but the only link between them is BTC.  You can't trade LTC for ETH.
also if you in the States trying to avoid taxes by trading just crypto and staying out of fiat, that doesn't work.
@_date: 2018-01-16 16:23:49
Any trade for any amount, be it crypto or Fiat, is a taxable event.   So if you buy and hold you will have no capital gain taxes in the USA.  
But the moment you do sell you'll have to calculate any gains and then pay taxes on those gains depending on what your tax bracket is.
@_date: 2018-01-01 08:24:58
Tx can expire after 2 weeks, so the BTC may not be lost.

@_date: 2018-01-29 03:31:18
Providing liquidity for the exchange. Without limit orders you can't have market orders. But you can have limit orders (submitted, not filled) without Market orders. So those who provide them normally get a discount.  On GDAX they happen to be free.
@_date: 2018-01-04 18:31:26
Exchanges batch their transactions, and charge a flat fee for everyone (Gemini and GDAX are not counted here)  So they generally make money off out going transactions.   
Also code updates take time, money and resources, and also open up platforms possible vulnerabilities so a lot of testing has to go into the upgrade as well.   The bigger exchanges handle a lot more users so they have even more reason to be extremely careful about an upgrade.  While it is frustrating, and long overdue at this point, I can see why exchanges are dragging their feet.  
@_date: 2018-01-06 07:19:01
Commence the jingling?
@_date: 2018-01-29 03:53:21
It's all good :)
@_date: 2018-01-04 19:05:28
GDAX if your looking for less fees.  (coinbased owned, so if your looking to stay away from them in general thats a bad choice) 
Gemini is a good choice as well.   
Unsure of your local, but those answers are if your in the States.

@_date: 2018-01-29 02:17:13
While this is true, if the transaction is worth thousands I think I'd go the safe route and make sure everything works. Even if I end up with extra inputs.  But that's me

Nope.  You only pay taxes when you sell and make a profit.

Found the real estate appraiser / agent / smart person who understands business.
@_date: 2018-01-04 18:45:56
So your 1st transaction (high fee)  is spending a output of the 2nd transaction (low fee)  and because of this it will not confirm until the 2nd (low fee) transaction confirms.  Your in dead lock until that happens.  And with a 70 sat/b fee it might take a while for that to go through.   
I could be completely wrong with my assessment but that seems to be the problem here.  
@_date: 2018-01-01 08:17:36
This is correct.  time stamps from when you trade into or out of USD, not where the business is located.  
@_date: 2018-01-01 08:31:38
potentially puts a target on you.  For instance lets say bitcoins value gets to.... $500,000
You've admitted to owning a lot of money now.  Brings unwanted attention.   While it may be viewed as being extremely paranoid, I'd rather be safe than sorry.  
@_date: 2018-01-01 08:26:09
You'll need to wait for a support response most likely.  
Also don't say how much Bitcoin you have.  "I have an amount of BTC on bitpay"  
@_date: 2018-01-16 17:01:14
No problem, also consider talking to a tax professional if you've made significant gains.
@_date: 2018-01-04 18:35:16
A dollar is a dollar.  Its market cap is not 100x more because you can turn it into 100 pennies.  
I'm not following your logic.
@_date: 2018-01-04 19:56:08
Thats due to the node that Blockchain.info uses.  If that happens again use another site like blockexplorer.com

I'm so hungry :(
@_date: 2018-01-04 19:02:24
Yes its normal.   Fees do not scale with the amount of BTC sent, just the transaction size.   Due to the recent price run up, and the mempool size, fees have gone up which is why it cost you so much to send.   
If you were transferring from an exchange, next time wait for  larger amount of bitcoin before sending.  You'll pay the same fee, but ti will be a much lower % of what your sending.  
@_date: 2018-01-04 18:39:22
What is the address greenwallet is giving you?   Make sure it is correct.  
If it is correct, try using another browser.   
Also this should go without saying, but if your moving a large amount of BTC, send a small amount first as a test, even more so if your having trouble like this.  
@_date: 2018-01-01 08:33:51
Its just a interface. Your seed words can be imported into other wallets. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 00:03:51
I feel like that might be true for most platforms these days with the amount of new users vs their support staff.  
However still good information to know.
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:08:49
Hmmm.  Possibly could be an expired link.  I'm not sure if blockchain. Info has a support staff but if you can find a email it might be worth reaching out to them.  They might be able to look back in their system and see that there is unclaimed Bitcoins.  That would be your best bet.
@_date: 2017-12-14 22:37:43
Due to the nature of Bitcoin being a digital asset it is a high priority Target for hackers and scammers.  It's just generally safer to not discuss exact amounts of Bitcoin. Also if the price does continue to go up the amount you have now may be insignificant to you currently, but in the future it could be very significant.  So significant that people start to try to figure out who you are so they can get it.
@_date: 2017-12-14 22:40:56
You sound like a statistics junkie like me.  Unfortunately I don't think this data exist. Large bulk of fake ones remind by early adopters so I guess you would have to put a zero for them.
There's also way too many exchanges so it would be very hard to get a complete dataset.  This would mean that you'd have to survey people and people like to lie on surveys so that would be trustworthy either.
Simply put I don't think you're going to see this, but I agree it would be really cool to see.
@_date: 2017-12-14 22:44:00
Consolidating a wallet?  Looks like your fee is way too low.  And if I'm correct that's too low to accelerate using viabtc.  Sorry :(

Yes, find a wallet that supports Bcash and either scan your paper wallet or put in your private key.  You should have all the Bcash.  
Also this is not the sub for this kind of question.  
@_date: 2017-12-15 00:59:29
You can profit off it by buying all the coins at that wall, assuming you believe the price will rise further.

This is not a high enough fee.  
You can try to use  this:  
They only do 100 transactions each hour and it fills up quick.  
@_date: 2017-12-19 17:55:09
Most likely an extremely overloaded system.  You have to talk to them and I guarantee they are overwhelmed with support request.

I think anyone that predicted Bitcoin was a bubble for the last 2 years is going to claim they called it when it pops, regardless if it pops tomorrow or 6 months from now.
@_date: 2017-12-30 17:49:35
Very unfortunate.  Always make sure a Bitcoin transaction confirms before sending any product.
A lesson learned
@_date: 2017-12-30 17:39:01
If the transaction has been double spent then yes.  
I don't know the details of how you were sent this Bitcoin, but it sounds shady at best
@_date: 2017-12-21 13:26:08
P2P funding is always something I look for in a exchange.  Any plans for that?
@_date: 2017-12-14 22:20:20
Sounds... Invasive. But if they're being positive then I guess there is no harm.
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:28:01
Sadly I have no answers for paid services, nor do I know any miners.  
your fee is too low for the free services i know of, and those are currently over whelmed as well at this point.

Didn't notice that, still kinda neat
@_date: 2017-12-15 19:13:25

@_date: 2017-12-21 19:02:32
In 2014 there was a bear Market that lasted over a year.
The reason bull market lasted over a year and may not even be over yet this could just be a dip.
But the takeaway you should have from this is no one knows when this will end or if it's just the beginning. So hold on or let go.  Bitcoin will do what it does.
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:24:03
No.  Bitcoin is still being developed.  these are (Extremely large)  growing pains due to some world wide attention and the recent bull run.   Things will calm down and development always continues.
@_date: 2017-12-14 22:35:30
OP please post the transaction ID and we'll be able to assist you easier.
Most likely this is due to fees or a change address.
Bitcoin transactions are made up of inputs and outputs, your wallet takes inputs and then sends them.  If you don't have the exact amount it will take a larger input and break it into two outputs, one goes to the address you're sending to and the other one goes to your change address which is normally your wallet that you sent from.  So if I had to take a crazy guess it sounds like your wallet took a .09 input and broke it into a .06 input (the amount you want to send) and a .03 input. (Your change)  
But once again I transaction ID would really help.
@_date: 2017-12-14 22:58:36

Little known fact but the actor that played Charlie in that scene was us.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:38:37
thats your choice.  
@_date: 2017-12-14 20:32:09
Same rules, even easier if all the Bitcoins you sold were owned under a year or over a year.  You just need to know how much the cost you at that time, and  what they are worth now.
Ex:. You bought .1 BTC for 200 and then another .1 BTC for 400.   You sold both for 1700 over a year later.
600 (your cost) 
1700. (final amount)
1100 (total profit)
You'd pay long-term capital gains taxes on $1100.
The hard part for most people is they didn't keep track of what they spent.  But most exchanges keep a history so you'd have to dig through that.
@_date: 2017-12-16 15:59:39
No problem and sorry again!
@_date: 2017-12-14 19:44:33
Good luck!  Be safe with local Bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-12-14 23:42:45
Eventually the transaction will just be forgotten by the network.  Though I personally never experienced this and I have no idea how long that will take.
@_date: 2017-12-17 16:46:20
I wouldn't call Bitcoin dead. The network is overloaded right now due to all the price movements.  
Scaling should be on the horizon, until then we're going to have to wait for all these transactions to die down once the price decides to settle.
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:56:03
Specifically for Bitcoin if you just take the money and buy Bitcoin, you'll make more.  This is assuming that the value of Bitcoin continues to go up.
I can't talk about other coins.
@_date: 2017-12-14 23:06:09
We need more of these /s
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:40:18
No problem :)
@_date: 2017-12-28 09:03:51
Yes op, you would pay for any capital gains the following year, in this case 2019
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:26:06
I'm not kidding about how fast it fills up.  Be waiting to do it, and the moment you see your clock flip to 8, hit it.  have it prefilled out.  
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:38:03
Good luck
@_date: 2017-12-15 21:25:12
You're correct the fee is independent of coinbase, what I'm saying to you is deposit money (USD) onto coinbase to make a purchase of the amount of Bitcoin you need.  I would do that now so it's ready for Christmas.  You can then transfer that money to gdax (for free). And then withdraw it (also for free)
If you're trying to withdraw from your Ledger wallet you going to pay fees no matter what you do.  My work around only works if you have a bank account already attached to coinbase and you can get your coins to gdax exchange from coinbase so you can transfer.
Sadly I do not know of any other way to bypass Bitcoin Network fees.
@_date: 2017-12-15 02:09:48
There is always a need for more Full nodes.  Its something not too complicated and helps the network.  
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:48:22
deposits should be unlimited.  Its when you withdraw you will run into trouble. 
It might depend on how verified you are.  but if your doing this legitimately you should have no problems.  
Gemini is also a good exchange to look into.
@_date: 2017-12-14 19:40:15
The answer is  yes
I'm not familiar with how iPhone store Wallet information but there may be other users on here that can help you.
That being said please be careful with exactly what information you give out as they're also people that want free Bitcoins and are happy to scam or trick people to get it.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:24:19
Gemini would be next best I would think.
@_date: 2017-12-30 17:17:38
So you are correct the fee is way too small.
At this point you have two options. Option 1 is wait and hope that the transaction drops from the network.
Option 2 is using an accelerating service or contacting a minor and getting them to include your transaction in the next block.  This may come with a fee.
@_date: 2017-12-15 15:50:58
Hurting people with legitimate problems to serve your agenda.  I would just tweet at them, much simpler and doesn't kill the support queue.
@_date: 2017-12-19 17:52:52
I'm unsure, but I trust nothing.
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:37:27
Sorry I don't know that.  But you could go to their specific subreddit and ask that question I'm sure many people will be able to answer it.
@_date: 2017-12-16 15:54:50
So that wallet.dat file is the most important part of this.  I believe that is what you use to import into a bitcoin wallet. 
here is a guide that may help: 
@_date: 2017-12-15 05:11:07
So many coins, its hard to keep up with or so I assume.  They most likely only have so many developers, and those developers have to work on not only the wallet software, but any new upgrades to a network (like segwit) so the more coins they have the more they have to track.
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:59:47
You could always open up another exchange account and withdraw directly to it.  Or hope that when you want to go to an exchange, fees are cheaper.
@_date: 2017-12-17 19:18:14
Yup, try a few block explorers if something doesn't make sense  Might clear things up.  
@_date: 2017-12-14 22:17:30
Tether makes me paranoid.
@_date: 2017-12-25 00:39:56
No idea, sounds interesting though
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:50:13
Unsure, I am not going to look into it for you.  I'm just suggesting you be careful with what information you provide them.  
@_date: 2017-12-14 19:37:48
So why are you buying? Do you understand the technology or you just hoping that the price will keep going up?
What happens if the value of Bitcoin drops heavily?  Would you be upset? Your hear this a lot in the subreddit but please only invest what you're willing to lose.
As for your other questions coinbase is a fine app to use.  No one knows where the price is going so no one can tell you when to buy.  You'll have to roll the dice on that one.  
Either way good luck!  I hope you take the time to look at Bitcoin as a technology and not as a means to grow your net worth.

One of the major benefits to bitcoin is being in control of it.  "Be your own bank"
If you own Bitcoin on an exchange it's not yours its the exchanges.  I would probably be the biggest drawback but if that doesn't bother you then go for it.
@_date: 2017-12-16 15:46:36
It will happen once 19k is broken.

Not much a site can do with a transaction ID, so I don't see how it could be malicious.  Let me know how your experience is with them, if you feel like it in the future that is :)
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:00:40
I tried, but it was full already.   
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:06:57
You can hope the backlog clears and it gets confirmed.
You can hope it drops from the mempool (unlikely, but can happen.  Takes a long time (2 weeks +)  
You can talk to a miner and have them add your transaction to their next block.
you can pay a accelerator service.

Sounds like a Bitcoin dice Casino, unfortunately I'm not very familiar with them so I can't suggest any, but I'd start there at least.

@_date: 2017-12-20 03:51:30
Depends on the fee you use when you important that paper wallet into the wallet you are planning to send from.  
I would suggest using a 500+  sat / B fee.  If you have the option to set your fee.
If you dont then your at the mercy of your wallet which may set a low fee. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 17:07:38
It might be a very merry Christmas !
@_date: 2017-12-25 00:50:46
You'd want an exchange if you're planning on buying and selling. Coinbase is really good for just buying, but they have high fees to do both.
Gdax is an exchange owned by coinbase, and has much more reasonable fees.  Also free withdrawals currently. Here's a video on how gdax works
There are other exchanges as well such as Gemini which also provides free Bitcoin withdrawals but they do not support as many coins as gdax does currently.
All of this information can change in the future.
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:48:46
There's a large backlog, there's a large backlog your not the only one.
@_date: 2017-12-14 19:33:23
I wonder from a programming perspective which one would be harder.  I'm honestly curious.
@_date: 2017-12-14 22:19:25
You shouldn't share the amount of Bitcoin you own.
As for your question if it's in a coinbase account there should be an option to just sell.  You should already have a bank account hooked up but if you don't go through that process which might take some time.  After that withdrawal the cash = profit
@_date: 2017-12-30 16:57:28
Contact coinbase support.
Also consider using an exchange instead such as gdax or Gemini.  Much cheaper fees and you can transfer your Bitcoin away for free
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:55:37
That I do not know.  But if you do find one let me know so I can point others in the same direction.

I bet something happens.  Lets watch.
@_date: 2017-12-14 23:17:54
Hardware wallets or wallets that were generated on a desktop that's never been connected to the internet are your best options.  Unsure what wallet would be considered the best.
@_date: 2017-12-15 19:14:56
It's considered capital gains, so not other income.
Also because you didn't hold the asset for longer than a year you're going to be subject to short-term capital gains which is a higher percentage.  I am not a tax professional though so please seek some advice from some of that knows exactly what they're talking about.
@_date: 2017-12-15 02:22:59
Thank you for answering, I had no idea if that would be enough.  
@_date: 2017-12-14 22:55:29
Certainly check into that first before you go on a buying spree otherwise the fees transferring into those tokens and then back into other tokens you can actually store on a ledger could really add up
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:33:11
This would be building your own transaction from code in the command line.  Not recommended. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:33:56
I'll try to put it in on that site as well when the new hour comes around.

Okay I can get behind that.
But that's very much true about everything.  
I don't currently use social media so I'm not subjected to it as much.
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:27:31
Which exchanges have segwit support? 
@_date: 2017-12-14 20:38:02
And under normal Network conditions that probably would have been true and you would have had a confirmed transaction within that time frame.  Unfortunately the network is currently backed up so most transactions with lower fees will take much longer.
@_date: 2017-12-14 23:30:53
Thank you!
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:05:16
I only used it once, but that does look like the site I used.  
Once you import your keys, That wallet will ONLY give you control over bitcoin cash coins.  
Make sure your sending to a Bitcoin Cash address.

Why do you want to know the exact fee? If you sent from an exchange they generally do batched transactions.
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:29:19
No problem, and good luck!  
Also if your not aware, GDAX (coinbase exchange)  has less fees and free withdraws.  A good way to get around fees when sending to your wallet.  
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:49:12


HAHAHAHAHA  thank you for that. 
Anyways a hardfork is when someone takes the current software (lets say bitcoin)  and Forks it (changes it and creates a new version of it) 
Bcash is one such hardfork.  Bitcoin Gold is another.   But this isn't just limited to bitcoin, there can be hard forks of other non crypto software as well. 
This is a simplified expiation.  Someone might be able to get a bit more technical. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 15:07:00
I believe the default length of time a transaction stays in the main pool is set at 2 weeks.
How much was the fee?
@_date: 2017-12-14 22:26:11
Don't mine.  Unless you have free Power it's a waste of time and you'll make more just buying the currency directly.
The second part of your post is basically describing the mining process.  You're modifying the nounce but then your hashing it, that hash has to have a certain amount of zeros in it.  If it does then you've won the block. What you read about getting partial Bitcoins through mining is most likely referring to mining pools where they split up the reward depending on how much hashrate you're supplying.  Just add to this whenever you win a block you're also getting all the fees so you're going to get way more than the 12.5 block reward.
Yes use something like coinbase or gdax or Gemini.  Mining is an unprofitable hobby at this point.
@_date: 2017-12-29 07:35:17
Those were simpler times
@_date: 2017-12-19 17:48:09
What you should have done was taken the private key of the original wallet and imported that into more up-to-date wallet.  This would have given that wallet control over those Bitcoins without actually moving them on the blockchain which would have avoided a fee.  I'm not familiar with the first wallet you used to so this might not have been possible.
However you're saying that you moved the coins from your old wallet to the new one and you paid a fee to do so correct?  If that is in fact true then you should only have one input to move now. Inputs are combined into one output when moving two or more. So when you move to your coinbase wallet you shouldn't have any trouble.  You have to pay a fee but nowhere near the fee that you just paid.
This is assuming of course that you transferred the original inputs into one wallet and that wallet now should have just one input to move to coinbase.
@_date: 2017-12-14 22:07:30
Then yes you should be fine :)
@_date: 2017-12-17 17:09:46
Biggest tip is don't invest more than you willing to lose.
@_date: 2017-12-23 22:13:05
Unless the owners set up some way to transfer those Bitcoins upon their death, they will be lost.
@_date: 2017-12-15 01:43:12
From the Mempool**
@_date: 2017-12-15 22:01:33
Either work.  Your cost averaging so thats always good.  Just dont put more in that you can afford to lose.  
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:03:04
I do not have enough information.  I'd need the fees in Bitcoin not $$$
How big is the Transaction size?  is it one input or many?  
You need to be at least above 50 Sat/B for it to be confirmed within 24 hours.   
Around 630 sat / B if you want it confirmed next block.  
@_date: 2017-12-28 22:21:46
Bitcoin is deflationary because the current system of inflationary currencies bothered the Creator.  Or so it seems.
You are correct new cryptocurrencies can be created and used, however they are only as good as the the network and users that support them.  Bitcoin has the first-mover advantage and a good brand.  While other coins might take the spot light in the future, it won't be because of extra coins existing, it will be due to functionality and use cases.  
@_date: 2017-12-28 09:00:00
Do you keep your spoons in the same place?  I witness that keeping them segregated seems to improve the forks.

Not for me currently.  But it is certainly taking a beating.  
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:27:33
Next time do a test transaction.  At least when using Gdax so it doesn't cause so much panic.  
Best of luck to you!

Because tax evasion is a crime and most people dont realize they have to pay taxes when selling bitcoins.   Ignorance is not a defense in the eyes of the IRS, I'd rather people be armed with the information than find out later.

This OP.  Always understand what your putting your money into and the risks involved. 
If you did so in the past you might have realized the potential Bitcoin has.  It still has room to grow if it becomes more mainstream, but it oculd also be replaced.  Do your research and make up your own mind :)

Keep in mind using gdax you can buy with no fees (use a limit order). And transfer from the exchange with no fees.
Also keep in mind the prices will vary from exchange to exchange.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:45:01
Learn about what you put your money into.  Do some research, ask questions about the technology.  do not blindly invest because you were told it was a good idea or you think its a good idea.  KNOW its a good idea.

Oh nice, doing it smart.  Well done OP
@_date: 2017-12-17 17:57:25
So If I could ask, Could OP import their Private key into a wallet that supports RBF, or does the original transaction have to support RBF for you to be able to use it?  
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:37:39

@_date: 2017-12-28 23:01:18
thats true, I was mostly speaking to the coin cap.  But Your right. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:33:51
Whats the transaction ID? 
@_date: 2017-12-17 17:09:26
A lot.  Until a more standardized way to handle the transfer of coins when a user dies is implemented, there will be a lot of unaccessible coins.
Right now it's up to the user to put safeguards in place so they're coins can be passed on to friends or family.  I'm betting a greater proportion of crypto users don't have anything set up currently because they think they're going to live forever.
@_date: 2017-12-15 01:12:35
I always found the price went up after a plane ride.  happenstance I know but I like to pretend its my flights that cause the price to go up. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:23:10
you will not get far with no TX ID
Also you can do it yourself with this site for free because your fee is high enough: 
They only take 100 transactions a hour, and it fills up in less than a min so be quick.  
@_date: 2017-12-25 04:00:17
I hope your right.  Happy holidays
@_date: 2017-12-23 22:16:50
Are you putting it in Bitcoin and hopes that you make more money and can go on your trip sooner?
If you don't have a lot of funds I would suggest just buying small amounts Bitcoin and keeping them on the exchange until it becomes a large amount of Bitcoin in which case you should probably transfer it to an address that you own.
I would not suggest getting into Bitcoin in the hopes of reaching a specific monetary goal.
@_date: 2017-12-25 05:41:28
Unconfirmed transactions can disappear and appear on all the block explorers randomly.  This is because the black explorers use specific nodes and if that node doesn't happen to have your transaction it's been pool it doesn't exist to that block Explorer.
So worry not as long as one of the block Explorer sees it your transaction still alive.
The reason why this transactions on confirmed is because your fee is too low at around 100 sat/b
Your coins are not lost however they may remain unconfirmed until the transaction drops from the network.  The transaction could also be confirmed if the current backlog is cleared.  Last I checked we are around 40,000 unconfirmed transactions which is significantly lower than when we were above 100,000.
TL;DR: what you noticed is normal.  You'll have to wait for this to resolve itself.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:18:46
No one knows if its a good time to invest. 
People don't buy and sell as the price moves because it creates taxable events and it can get really confusing.   
It may look easy, but its not.   Be careful, only invest what your willing to lose, and please don't try becoming a trader unless you are very informed and have done lots of research.  
@_date: 2017-12-14 19:31:15
I hear Geminis good place to go as well.
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:04:04
It really could have been handled better.  
@_date: 2017-12-14 22:54:41
Very possible.  
@_date: 2017-12-15 19:47:38
@_date: 2017-12-31 08:09:38
Yes there will be a fee
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:16:55
Pay a higher fee.  No idea what fee you paid but it was not enough to get your coins to the exchange in a timely manner. 
That or keep your coins on a exchange if you plan on selling them and don't want to deal with block confirmations. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:20:25
You did nothing wrong.  your fee is actually fairly high. almost 500 sat/b which honestly should confirm within 24 hours (do not quote me on that)  
Give it time, but this is far from the worst case I've seen for a stuck transaction.  I promise everything will be Ok.
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:57:45
Gemini is literally a Bitcoin Exchange.  
Coinbase is just a on ramp to bitcoin, its not an exchange.  
GDAX is an exchange as well.  
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:45:41
Gdax covers the fee for you so you don't have to worry about it, and they generally set a decent fee.  Your transaction should show up in a ledger almost immediately though it may not be confirmed.  I'm not familiar with Ledger but if it's like any other Bitcoin wallet even unconfirm transactions should show up.  Although it might take a few minutes for it to show up if gdax hasn't broadcasted it to the network yet.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:44:00
you must have had bitcoin on the exchange when the fork happened in August.
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:59:42
Or they will start charging fees for withdrawing out of gdax.  Thats a easier solution than adopting segwit.
@_date: 2017-12-15 01:43:01
Eventually the network will drop your transaction.
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:26:57
Just the current state.  This is not the final release of bitcoin, while yes the current state of everything is very frustrating, it is not the end.  I agree bitcoin should be more than a store of value and I signed up for more than just that.  I'm optimistic though.
@_date: 2017-12-14 22:49:15
I'd be surprised if that's the case, but I wish you luck.
@_date: 2017-12-19 17:25:55
I would like that
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:54:00
518.381 sat/B  is a fine fee.  you should be fine, though it may take a day or 2.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:07:15
Why are you scared?
@_date: 2017-12-15 05:11:58

@_date: 2017-12-14 19:25:58
Please also be careful when sharing data.  Transaction IDs are public information so there's no risk to you, but do make sure you're not sharing any private keys or other sensitive information with people online no matter how nice they seem.  Just a note!
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:28:59
Ah, there are a lot of interesting physical coins out there.  Sadly they all come with a premium, can't think of a cheap option off the top of my head.

As a side note it's really interesting how everyone has a different name for that Christmas event.
My family has three names for it when is extremely incorrect "Secret Santa". I tell them every year this is wrong and something completely different.
They also call it Yankee Swap and Chinese Christmas.  That last one comes off as extremely racist. Never heard it called steal from your neighbor about throw that one in the mix next year :)
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:19:57
If you sent from your Nano S, there should be a transaction ID.  That would give me (and everyone else)  more information about this transaction and why its delayed.  with no ID, I can only guess it has to do with the fee you paid.    
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:14:35
Let me know when that confirms for you.   Any idea which mining pool they use?  
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:30:06
Currently fees are around 500 - 600 sat/B  
You'll transaction will confirm, it might take a few days though depending on how long this backlog lasts. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 22:20:25
The Bitcoin devs are currently working on a way to scale Bitcoin.  These fees are more akin to growing pains.  
@_date: 2017-12-15 16:15:19
Satan Works in amazing ways.
@_date: 2017-12-15 03:27:30
Well someone has to pay for the transaction, otherwise the transaction would never confirm.  Its just GDAX That covers it.   
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:13:47
This is good for current transaction fees.  
I hear the weekend is best for sending Bitcoin, but currently.... I don't think there will be any good days until this backlog is dealt with.  
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:45:29
Eventually the transaction back log will clear and your transaction will confirm.
Viabtc has a free Bitcoin accelerator service.  Just Google Bitcoin accelerator and it should be the first result.  Only problem is everyone's using it right now and they only accept the first 100 transactions.  It's not easy to get a transaction into it.
@_date: 2017-12-24 16:52:21
And having the marketplace use segwit addresses would reduce fees, but that's on their end.  You can write to them and request it however.
Unfortunately though it's a bad time to send Bitcoin transactions.  The mem pool does seem to be going down which is good, but we are far off from scaling in the short term.  
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:01:26
I would suggest contacting their support.  I don't work for GDAX or coinbase so I have no idea what they have in place for this type of situation.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:40:04
No.  When you buy it (say on coinbase)  youve already agreed to pay at that price.  
your bitcoin will be worth less when it arrives.
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:29:37
So let me ask you to explain a bit more. 
You roll dice,  is the order of who rolls decided before hand or random? 
I assume everyone rolls in turn until they hit doubles, then they can pick.  After they pick they no longer get to roll because they have a gift? 
How does the stealing phase work?  Is it at the end?  Or once you roll doubles you get to steal from people who already rolled doubles?   
Sorry I'm just trying to understand the mechanics of this, If it sounds like more fun I might be able to sell the family on it.  
@_date: 2017-12-14 20:16:33
Hello there I'm sorry that you're having this issue.
This is a Bitcoin accelerator service.  I only accept a hundred transactions every hour though and it fills up real quick ( normally within a min)
It's a free service you just have to pay attention to when the next hour is rolling around.  I've used it twice myself and had no problems. Once your transaction is accelerated you just have to wait for that pool to find another block and it should be confirmed after that.

Those are  estimates.  If new transactions are being added to the network faster than they are being mined you may see a longer wait time.

Best Strategy:  Buy bitcoin, hold it in hopes it goes up in value 
How much will you profit:  Depending on how much it goes up and when you sell will dictate that. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 19:11:55
Originally it was.  Unfortunately however this changed when bitcoin became popular.  Block space is limited to prevent spam transactions and other attack vectors on the network and scaling is a bit off in the future.
Essentially the network is still being developed and these are growing pains.

Hi, no not here.  go to an exchange.
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:11:37
What are you asking here exactly?
@_date: 2017-12-15 22:21:41
This is a wallet address that you provided me.  This wallet has no transactions meaning no Bitcoin has ever been sent to it.   
Are you trying to move the Bitcoin cash? If so I wouldn't be able to help you with that.  You have better luck posting this on. /r btc
@_date: 2017-12-15 02:11:41
Too easy to go down this rabbit hole.  
There was a time you could mine Millions of dollars worth of bitcoin a day, with a laptop. (2017 bitcoin value of course applied here)  
Don't waste your time dreaming of what you could do in the past when you can be planning your future :)

Every exchange has maintenance.  None of them would risk losing customer funds or just bugs in general by applying changes live.  
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:23:02
You might do better asking this question over in the Bitcoin Market subreddit.
@_date: 2017-12-15 21:02:54
Thats a very nice person.  But no you havent been hacked.  Your wallet should show you the amount sent, even when its unconfirmed.  If you see a transaction on the network, but no balance in your wallet then something fishy *MIGHT* be happening, but it could also be your wallet software not being fully caught up to the current mempool.   either way once a transaction confirms its yours forever.  so enjoy!
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:48:54

I would believe that any stock could split, but if the shares represent Bitcoin then I'm sure that would create a huge regulatory headache.  
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:46:47
Just remember if you get it in, ViaBTC still has to find a block which might take some time. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 16:14:23
Unfortunately I don't believe there are any exchanges that allow you to use your backup seat phrase to deposit Bitcoin.  But that's a interesting idea... 
Your best bet is just to wait until the transaction volume dies down so you can send a cheaper transaction, or pay a small amount and try to get the transaction accelerated.
@_date: 2017-12-14 19:09:32
Do you have the transaction ID?  did it confirm?  
If it's confirmed then you need to reach out to coinbase support.
@_date: 2017-12-16 14:24:00
Personally you can keep your coins on an exchange and have a stop loss order setup.  This would insulate you and ensure that you get out at a certain price point if the price starts to Tumble significantly.  
But honestly I don't think there's much we can do as a community.  If tether is a scam, then when the Music Stops there's going to be a reckoning.
But without any solid proof the music will keep playing, and who knows how long that will go.

@_date: 2017-12-20 02:41:29
To be sure I understand what your talking about.  You would like to send all your bitcoin from one address, tothe SAME address?  Or are you sending from one wallet you control to another wallet you control with the same Private key?   
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:52:05
@_date: 2017-12-17 17:32:02
Sounds like you did your due diligence so good on you.  Most of these posts are people not seeing the Mempool size or setting a low fee.  
for this transaction:  
 
You should see this confirmed sometime today.  The fee is appropriate and I see no issues.  
However this transaction seems to have no fee? Or at least the block explorer is showing it that way.  
 
Unless the block explorer I'm using is bugging out. Which is possible.
I would also like to note that I was not able to find these transactions using 2 other blockchain explorers.... I'm not sure the cause of this but it seems like these transactions have not propagated fully yet.  
@_date: 2017-12-29 17:57:50
This.  Some nodes will rebroadcast transactions, transactions do not have time stamps associated with them so node only knows when it arrived.  If it gets rid broadcasted the countdown clock starts over again.
@_date: 2017-12-15 00:21:40
Congrats you were "airdropped" Forked coins, also grats on the amount you had laying around, that must have been a nice feeling.  
Do with them what you wish.  They do have USD value, but you'll have to find a exchange that you can sell them on.  Currently I believe poloniex allows you to trade BCH but not BCG.   
You can of course keep them,  They could be worth more in the future, or less.  I don't know :)  
@_date: 2017-12-17 16:57:34
Greetings let me first say that there's no reason to panic.
Things may seem helpless but you do not have to worry.  Nodes have a default setting to keep transactions in their mempool (this is where all unconfirmed transactions stay until they become confirmed by minors) for maximum of two weeks. You're about 2 days away from that so in about 2 days you're transaction should drop from the network, allowing you to create a new one at your leisure.
@_date: 2017-12-17 18:15:52
Unfortunate that he is no longer around, but it may be best in the long run we don't have a leader.  
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:22:13
The only way you can do this is by using a exchange like GDAX where you can withdraw for free.  
You'd also need to set up a wallet for who ever your are buying for, since you do not wish for it to be a paper wallet you'll want to set up a digital one on a phone or computer.  Send to that address from GDAX and your done.  
Not sure what else your looking for here.
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:47:53
Open source public blockchain.  you can make your own Bitcoin if you want and copy the bitcoin block chain. 
The reason why Bitcoin cash is not a failed project (currently)  is due to the support they have.  It may stick around forever it may die in a few years.  Weather that happens has nothing to do with Bitcoin allowing it or not allowing it to exist.  
@_date: 2017-12-14 19:57:01
It's really unfortunate, but I believe Gemini allows you to purchase immediately after you request a bank transfer, you just can't withdraw until the funds arrive.  
I never used them though so please verify! 
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:40:33
I get you. its all good :)
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:10:04
It may, but it might take a while.  24 hours + .
Please keep that in mind.  If this needs to go through quicker than you need to pay a higher fee
@_date: 2017-12-15 01:04:09
They are curious.  Hell I want to know how many bitcoins everyone on here have, I just know that no one will tell me so I'm not going to ask.  Nor would I share that info myself, but that doesn't mean I don't want to know.  
Its just a new asset.  In time it will be viewed as rude, but right now not many people are taking it seriously. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 07:01:22
GPUs havent been useful for mining bitcoins in years.  
Mining in general is not profitable for a average user.  You'd need a  ASIC and even then youd need access to free power or close to free.  
Do not tryto mine, but if you must mine for what ever reason, head over to r/bitcoinmining
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:27:03

You're asking people to speed up your transactions but you want them to send the new transactions?  This will require them to have access to your wallet and they could just steal all your coins. be careful.
@_date: 2017-12-23 04:41:01
No problem! Glad to be of help :)
@_date: 2017-12-23 22:27:27

@_date: 2017-12-16 14:12:08
When you don't own your private Keys you're at the mercy of the person or entity that does. In this case coinbase.
They may in the future support it but for now you're SOL.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:51:17
Seems like it.  Lets see how this one goes.  
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:00:55
The choice of which exchange you use is yours, But to answer your question yes you can buy directly from gdax and then transferred to a wallet of your choice.
I've never used bitstamp so I can't say much, but I will warn future people that their verification process takes a while thanks for the information.
@_date: 2017-12-17 17:18:32
Sorry! I'm on mobile didn't catch that.
Unfortunately that is extremely low, meaning that you wouldn't be able to get the transaction accelerated unless you felt like paying a fee.
This means you have to wait for the transaction to drop from the network which will take about two weeks.
@_date: 2017-12-25 03:34:47

Yes but if the forks are useless, then there is no point to them.  
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:22:42
Correct.  what you paid (including any fees) would be your cost basis.  This is a new asset that was created from your current asset, so there is no USD cost basis.  The full amount will be taxed.   Honestly it could be counted as income....  Talk to a tax professional for more info, not some loser like me on reddit.  
@_date: 2017-12-17 16:41:27
You should certainly have Bitcoin cash if you bought before the fork, you have the private key which is all you need.  You just need to find a wallet that supports Bitcoin cash. 
Unfortunately I don't know which wallet to suggest to you and I have no guides.  Sorry :(
@_date: 2017-12-29 20:21:27
Potentially.  This doesn't always happen but it can happen.
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:56:14
whats the fee? 
It may drop from the network, it may also confirm if the backlog clears out.  
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:56:39
Very impressive.
@_date: 2017-12-15 22:03:33
Withdrawing from GDAX to any address (bitcoin, ETH, LTC) currently is free.  So just get wallet addresses for your family and send.  No fees required.  Enjoy.
edit:  Spelling.
@_date: 2017-12-15 23:24:24
A wise choice :)
@_date: 2017-12-14 22:04:25
Unless you know your private key that Bitcoins gone.  Knowing the address doesn't help, you need the private key that controls it.
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:55:15
No problem.  Should confirm pretty quick too.  Gdax is really good about setting appropriate fees.

The network is currently working through a backlog of thousands of unconfirmed transactions.
It sounds like you didn't use a high no fee so you're transaction will have to wait, or it might fall off of the network in the coming weeks.
Don't be worried.

this may help:  
@_date: 2017-12-19 17:56:04
Probably not.  
Personally I prefer the diversification.  But if you're a Gambling Man then you feel like Bitcoins going to outperform then go right ahead.  Just have to deal with the taxes from selling Amazon.

It's an unregulated Market. 
There's also theories that tether is being printed and used to keep the price inflated.  So that could *possibly* be the cause.

That really depends on what exactly it says.  It could be a wallet Private key, it could be a backup of a wallet (as another user said, a list of 12 words)  It could just be a wallet address.
But if it was $10 it might have been coinbase.  Have you tried logging into Coinbase?  Maybe check to see if you ever had a account.  I recall them giving Bitcoin away for new user referrals.  
  
^ See if you signed up with a email account you used to use.  There may be Bitcoin waiting for you :)
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:37:03
Not unless your wallet supports replace by fee.  
See if there is a "child pays for parent" option somewhere with the wallet you use.

This sounds too good to be true!
@_date: 2017-12-14 23:15:22
Bitcoin accelerator is your best option, you just need to be very quick on the draw.
Sounds like your brother has an understanding of cryptocurrency, just send him the transaction ID that should be proof enough.  Sounds like he's just being a little whiny baby at the moment.  
Just bad luck with the recent increase in prices that tends to cause the mempool to rise which in turn makes transactions more expensive.
@_date: 2017-12-29 15:49:24
And other physical coins / bars as well.  But cas coins will always be the most wanted
@_date: 2017-12-15 22:02:13

@_date: 2017-12-20 02:05:26
Np.  I'll try again next hour if I remember.  
As I said though, your fee isnt horribly low.  Even if we dont accelerate this, you should see a confirm within 24 to 48 hours.

As I said before, your not in as bad of shape as I've seen on here.  I've seen ~30 sat /B 
Anything under 100 is going to be stuck for a long time.  your transaction should get confirmed within a day or 2.

When dealing with immutable irreversible transactions, its best to do your due diligence before and not after.  
I do not know this site, but I would be very untrusting of any site that claims to be a escrow service.  I hope this gets resolved for you OP.

Always best to not discuss matters of money with anyone. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 00:24:52
Looks like 400 Satoshis/byte is the current fee that will get you into the next block.  Assuming a transaction size of 225 bytes, this results in a fee of 90,000 satoshis or 14.85
You can of course put a lower fee, 200 sat/b might be high enough, that would be 45,000 satoshis  or about 7.42.   
Just dont send a transaction out with less than 100 s/b or you'll be waiting a very long time.
@_date: 2017-12-17 17:39:31
If its a Large amount of money, you should talk to a professional about this.

I'm assuming your talking $$$ and not crypto.
If that's the case it's generally done within 5 business days.  But that can very bank to bank, and depending on how much your moving.
If your depositing 10k+ you should give your bank a heads up.

@_date: 2017-12-14 19:16:17
You're feeling what a lot of people felt probably after the original run up to a 1000.  Well it may seem impossible, it certainly isn't impossible for the price to continue to increase.  
Will it?  No idea.  Should you cash out?    If you feel like you should then do it. If your in profit you at least take something away from this right?   Just make sure you report your taxes.

@_date: 2017-12-28 09:02:06
If you have the transaction ID you should be able to look it up with any block Explorer.  Easiest way to find the fee is either using the block  Explorer (they do it for you normally). Or taking the original amount of Bitcoin you sent and subtracting from it the outputs.  This will leave you with the fee you paid.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:58:03
ETH is not a fork no.  LTC may be considered forked.  I know its based on BTC code, but its been modified for quicker block times.  And I'm sure some other things.  
but they didn't fork from the bitcoin blockchain, they made their own blockchain from what I know.
@_date: 2017-12-15 01:41:04
They are generally not good.  You stand to make more money if you just buy Bitcoin with the money.

Goodness no. 
right after the chart there will be a brief explanation on what the best fee would be. 


For the median transaction size of 226 bytes, this results in a fee of 142,380 satoshis
so if you want to get into the next block you'd have to spend 630 sat / B
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:03:53
Slow down.
You went to Gemini and got an address to withdraw too, then you went to GDAX and withdrew from there to that address?  
You should have a transaction ID from GDAX.  Can you provide that?  
go to the top right of GDAX near where your name is, and open the menu there,  then go to Accounts.  From there go to BTC Account and then on the top right side of the screen you should see "history Holds Transfers"  Click transfers and find your transaction ID by clicking your recent transfer. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 08:04:47
In any case you're going to need to contact their support for assistance.  Unless the funds show up in your bank account.
@_date: 2017-12-17 18:13:27

Interesting.  We pick numbers,  number 1 gets to go first, they pick a gift open it and show the rest of the group, then number 2 goes.  2 gets to open a gift, show the group, but they also get the choice to trade with number 1.  Then 3 picks a gift, and they can trade with 1 or 2.  4 picks, and can trade with 1 2 or 3.  This goes until everyone has their turn. Then finally number 1 can pick from any gift they want.   
Its a lot of fun and generally causes a ton of in fighting and collusion.

Yup your looking for a "Stop loss" order also known as a Stop.   Just set the amount you want to sell and the stop price, it will trigger (as a market order, so there will be fees) once the price is equal to or lesser than that value.  
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:32:57
Different people.  There's always going to be someone on the other side of the fence.

When you send a transaction it's broadcast to the Bitcoin Network and held in the  mempool. 
Nodes are the keepers of the men pool and generally have a default setting to hold onto transactions no longer than 2 weeks.
So transactions do go unconfirmed, and just drop, or fall out of the mempool.
Of course other nodes will rebroadcast these unconfirm transactions and keep them alive sometimes.
@_date: 2017-12-15 02:23:30
Default for most nodes is set at 2 weeks.  
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:58:52

So you sent this BTC to an exchange correct? From what you posted it looks like you sent 0.11235 BTC successfully to the address 18k2RgCXVQWUFskk4V74H8MFACyB8X1hiG
The input has been successful spent to that address. So it should show up in your account there.


What exactly do you mean by this? You might be seeing something I am not.
@_date: 2017-12-17 16:43:43
The Exchange owns the private keys that owns those Bitcoins currently. The only solution I can think of is opening up a support ticket and asking if there is a quicker way to withdraw.
I've never used Kraken so maybe someone else knows another way.
@_date: 2017-12-15 03:06:40
Your just begging for up votes arnt you.

I can see this happening soon if the popularity of Bitcoin or cryptocurrencies in general continues.
Most likely they would have each kid making their own coins and saying how better they are.  No probably some dumb coins like buttholecoin and the like.  Cartman's would probably be anti-Semitic.
Guess we'll have to wait and see.
@_date: 2017-12-14 19:43:59
My recommendation is always gdax.com which is an exchange that coinbase owns.  If you use limit orders there are no fees involved meaning you get 100% of your USD turned into Bitcoin with no fee.  Another added bonus is withdrawing Bitcoin from gdax has no transaction fee currently.
Gemini is also good, I haven't used it myself however I've heard great things from friends and people on Reddit.
However you noted that you have PayPal, I'm not familiar with exchange is enough to know which ones accept PayPal for deposits, or if there are any american-based ones that do.
@_date: 2017-12-21 12:52:01
So the wallet you use shouldn't effect how long the transaction is unconfirmed.  That depends on the nodes that hold it.
Glad it was dropped though!
@_date: 2017-12-31 08:05:54
Best of luck to you

@_date: 2017-12-14 19:51:23
Please be aware that it's only no fees if you're Market maker, meaning your providing liquidity to The Exchange.  To further break it down what I mean is you have to set a limit order, not a market order.  Market orders have fees.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:03:53
Eventually.  But i would highly suggest using that accelerator if you can.  its hard to get a transaction in it, but if you can it should help.
otherwise your transaction will just sit until it confirms or the transaction drops form the network, which can take 2 weeks or longer. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:32:34
Exchanges use many wallets and cold storage.  Its possible your deposit was swept away into cold storage and not taken away by a hack.  
Many people seem to think that exchanges have one address for each of their clients and the funds stay there forever until you withdraw.  Not he case, this would be madness and expose all of the funds of said exchange, as all fund would be in a hot wallet and not in cold storage.  
I can't speak about them losing your money, but I can say that what your describing doesn't sound out of the ordinary for an exchange.   (in terms of bitcoin moving addresses, the funds not showing up on their platform is VERY concerning.) 
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:48:30

I think they would argue that World of Warcraft gold doesn't have value, only in the game itself.  Where bitcoin does, and it's extremely significant, specifically when juxtaposed against Warcraft gold.
But I'm just guessing here, I have no idea how the IRS would handle this.  Just providing the other side of the coin.
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:36:32
Nope, its instant which is great, also free.  
The problem you may run into is GDAX requires a sign up, and that might take time.  
@_date: 2017-12-25 06:51:40
They have big players trading on their Exchange, and those big players probably don't withdraw.  The eat fees because they are making money on the trading fees.

So I'm confused did you pay $100 for .1 Bitcoin? Or you saying you bought .1 Bitcoin and then later on noticed there was $100 charge sperate from this purchase?
Are you sure you didn't mistakenly set up a recurring Buy, or that you may have deposited another $100 to buy Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-29 15:56:32
To be fair, 1000 sat/b is 100+ sat/b.
Wallet software needs to be better at seeing fees.  This is proof that the generally public need their hand held.  But we already knew that.

Sadly this is a coinbase issue, no idea why they are blocking you from using your cards.  Could be a false positive on some AML or KYC check.

Well that's unfortunate.
You're most likely have to use a replace by fee transaction, unfortunately I've never done that and would not be able to assist you with it.
@_date: 2017-12-15 21:47:34
Forgive me, I used a poor choice of words.  I also haven't used coinbase in a long time.  Buy using coinbase and transfer the BTC to GDAX so you can withdraw for free,  or transfer cash onto GDAX  when you are able to set up an account, and buy on GDAX and withdraw for free.  


This is what I am saying.  GDAX will cover all the fees of transferring it, jsut make sure you withdraw directly to your paper wallet :)
The problem you face is getting USD to GDAX, or BTC you bought on coinbase to GDAX.  Opening a GDAX account might take time as well.  
@_date: 2017-12-15 22:04:50

OP, whatever this person said was deleted so it must have been wrong. 
The correct answer was posted here though, whenever you sell your Bitcoin on any exchange or over any kind of platform or medium, it is a taxable event.

Youd have to import your private key into a wallet that does support bitcoin gold.  Assuming you gave a valid BTG address that your private key had access too.  But I am not a BTG expert so I am not sure.

It means that Coinbase was most likely keeping track of user funds when the fork happened (I forget when but it already happened) they most likely took a snapshot of everyone's funds and will be giving them an equal amount of Bitcoin cash.  If that's the case you don't have to worry and they will be awarding you your Bitcoin cash.    But they will only be giving you the same amount of Bitcoin cash as you had in Bitcoin at the time of the fork.
Edit, fixed. reply from mobile not making any sense.
@_date: 2017-12-15 21:00:42
what exactly are you asking here?  your question is a little broad is all.   If your looking for a place to acquire bitcoin your location would be useful.  If your curious how the network works i would point you to youtube, there are many videos that would do a much better job explaining things than anyone on reddit, there is just to much to cover :) 
   &lt;&lt;&lt; this youtube channel is a fantastic place to start as well. 
If you have any specific questions please ask!  I'll do my best to answer. 
Also dont tell people how much bitcoin you have.  Just a good general rule to follow.  
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:49:46
You have 2 problems.  One your buy wont go through until your money gets to CB (your wait until 12/28/17)  And then your second problem is sending the BTC to that wallet when it finally hits your account. You'll have to pay fees, which are currently  (average) $23.46   
Source: 
Using Preev to get the USD value: 
So you'd lose most of that.
Solutions!:  I can't help you with your coinbase  purchase. its going to take as long as its takes.  Your note idea is clever but it might make one of your coworkers feel jaded. 
As for the fee issue!  I can offer some help.  You'll need to open a GDAX account (this is coinbase's exchange)  It is free to transfer bitcoin to GDAX from Coinbase, and it is free to withdraw bitcoin from GDAX (or any crypto) They cover all mining fees.  
So create a GDAX account now for future withdraws and then withdraw from there when you buy.  
Also consider buying from GDAX, the fees are lower.

@_date: 2017-12-14 23:33:14
I don't think so.  Really what you need is a stable price for the transactions to go down.  Think of it this way: when the price is going up people are trying to move their coins either to exchanges to sell or away from them to keep them safe.
During a crash the same thing will happen, although more people would be trying to get their coins to an exchange to sell then moving them off of exchanges.  
Price movements in general tend to cause transactions spikes.  
@_date: 2017-12-28 22:16:41
Indeed this is extremely troubling.
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:47:07
It works the same way as stocks.  The price you see is most likely the last traded price.
If you're looking at a ticker, that ticker could be an aggregate between several exchange prices.  
It's literally the same as the stock market in terms of how the price is reported.  They just happens to be many exchanges and they all exchange different rates due to how easily you get Fiat or crypto out/in. Or what country it's in.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:34:23
Your wanting to consolidate all your inputs in one wallet to a single address?  There should be no problems here, you will be paying a very high fee though.  Please keep this in mind.  I would wait until the network is a little less busy.  
@_date: 2017-12-17 18:29:53
Monkeys can't be sent to anyone in the world instantly (though confirmation times can lag during these price moves) 
Clearly he is trying to make bitcoin look like a scam, but there is real value in bitcoin, millions spent on mining and countless hours on development from some of the smartest people in the space.  These are not pet rocks or wild monkeys.  This is a immutable ledger that gives the power of control to the people.  
I think its pretty neat.  Or at least more neat than some monkeys.

Do you still know the friend that gave you the Bitcoin? Perhaps they can help you as they're a trusted source (I assume)
@_date: 2017-12-17 18:00:56
That makes sense.  You sent this BTC to an exchange, exchanges do not keep BTC on specific addressed for their users, they use cold storage and hot wallets so after your BTC arrived, they most likely either moved it to cold storage, or possibly it was used to withdraw funds.   
Your BTC exists on their platform now.  So you can't follow it anymore after your first transaction to deposit.  
You need to talk to their support and figure out what happened on their end.  
@_date: 2017-12-23 22:04:46
Haha, I gave you like 10 seconds!  5 times the amount that you just requested!

@_date: 2017-12-17 16:38:55
You going to need to contact their support because that transaction is confirmed so that Bitcoin should be with Bittrex currently.  Unless you provided the wrong transaction ID.  
At this point only Bittrex can assist you.
@_date: 2017-12-14 22:29:31
If that's the case then most likely you're out the $1,500.  But coinbase support will be the best source of information.

1). Yes
2) no issues, you should be fine.
3) I'm not a wallet expert but I believe you'll write, your 12 word phrase would have generated well it's for those other currencies if you feel like using them in the future, but they would be no balance.

@_date: 2017-12-29 15:51:46
User GDAX or Gemini if you want to buy bitcoin.  They pay your mining fees when transferring off exchange.
Or buy other coins with cheaper fees from coinbase.
Coinbase is a good starter for buying cryptocurrencies did you plan on continuing to buy them I would suggest finding an exchange.  You'll save more in the long run.

Not exactly true.  If you're being paid Bitcoin for a service that's income and its taxable.
If you're selling Bitcoin for a profit that's capital gains and that's taxable.
But if you buy Bitcoin you never sell it then you can't be taxed on it.  
@_date: 2017-12-28 22:01:10

55.296 sat/B
this is too low, currently you need to be paying 500 sat/B or more.  
find a miner to put it in the next block they mine.
Hope the backlog goes down and it gets confirmed.
hope it drops from the network. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 20:27:31
Whenever you're moving Bitcoin between wallets using the network there's going to be a transaction fee. 
Things to look out for:
Scams.  They are everywhere.  Phishing sites, malware, seemingly trustworthy people giving advice.  Be paranoid.
Something to note about fees, well it's generally will set these for you, but some wallets will allow you to set your own fees, you can look at the Bitcoin Network and see how many unconfirmed  transactions there are and determine what your fee should be.
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:51:49
Could be worse, you could have sold at 12.9k
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:19:04

You decide how you feel, but trading with emotion will not turn out well.  
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:17:04
Well if you have a exchange account set up, there isn't much you have to worry about in terms of safty.  Just send the BTC to the exchange, but be advised that fees are a little crazy right now.  80,000 unconfirmed Transactions currently and that doesn't look like it will go down anytime soon.  So you might be paying a hefty fee (500 Satoshi / byte or higher)    if you want it to get to the exchange.  
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:48:18
No progress, instead you need to get the transaction ID. Then you can use a block explorer and see if your transaction has confirmed or not.
@_date: 2017-12-25 05:35:20
Your too kind :)
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:01:45

Nice guy.  Hmmm ok. Well if you run out of options and give up and if you're willing to trust a random stranger on the internet feel free to private message me the link you got in a text message.  Worst case scenario you'll still have no Bitcoin, best case I figure out a way to Get to it and we get it to your exchange so you can sell.
Up to you, I don't blame you if you don't trust me, there wouldn't be any hard feelings.
@_date: 2017-12-15 20:54:57




If you have a coinbase account you might be able to use GDAX, and if you can use GDAX you can  Transfer bitcoin free off the exchange, to any address you want (in this case a paper wallet)  
I think that would be your best bet.  Go to Gdax.com and see if you can set up a account, im not sure the process for anyone who already has a coinbase account, but if you start now you should get it all done before Xmas comes.  
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:28:03

Oh thats good.  Go to the receive section and generate another Address and then just send to that address.  should be no problem.  
@_date: 2017-12-14 19:24:11
Okay so you're transaction didn't go through yet.  It's stuck due to what seems to be a low fee used.  You paid about 20 satoshi's per byte of data, which is low, due to the amount of network congestion at this time.
Your best bet is to use an accelerator service.  This is the best one I know of (it's free) but it only accepts a hundred transactions an hour and generally gets filled up fast.
 You'll then have to wait for this mining pool to mine another block before it confirms.  It could be another hour or longer.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:40:07
thank you for providing this ID. Your Transaction is fine.  the fee is just a little low at 384.643 sat/B 
Currently to get into the next block you need to be around 500+ sat/B  But do not worry, this is still a good fee, it just might take  24 to 48 hours to clear.  Assuming the network doesn't get any further delayed. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 16:34:39
I'm always paranoid that I'm actually on a scam site rather than the legitimate site. So I don't blame your paranoia here.  
I was unaware that ledger didn't accept Bitcoin and I've never purchased a ledger product with or without Bitcoin so I won't be any help for you. 
I do know they sell on Amazon, but the same problem arises am I buying from a legitimate Ledger account or is this a fake one trying to trick me.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:06:56

@_date: 2017-12-14 18:29:05
So in the future if there's a lightning Network, miners would be making fees off of those channels opening and closing.  If Bitcoin still around and still being used then we would have a giant user base and hopefully have scaled to Visa sized levels.  
Will the fees be enough? That's hard to say because we don't know what the value of Bitcoin will be at that time. But mining is designed to adjust depending on the hashrate so I guess the hope is will reach a happy medium where the hash rate is high enough to prevent anyone from doing a 51% attack, and minors are making a profit.
@_date: 2017-12-28 21:57:00
I often remind people because most don't realize selling Bitcoin is a taxable event.  What they do with that knowledge afterwards is up to them.

But if I had to take a random stab at it, since your friend used a game currency to buy bitcoin, the cost basis should be 0, meaning they would have to pay taxes on the full amount.
But I'd be more worried about answering all the questions from your friends bank and the government when they see a $3,000,000 deposit hit their bank account.  
Get a professional to help.

Luckily in your case they're actually maybe a way.
You have to open up a gdax account which is coinbase exchange. 
You can then transfer your Bitcoin or Litecoin or ethereum to gdax for free.
Gdax happens to have free withdrawals, or to put it correctly, they pay the transaction fee for Bitcoin Litecoin and ethereum withdrawals.
Tim after transferring your coin of choice withdraw to your address for free and enjoy.
Please note that opening up a gdax account can take some time.

It might need to catch up transaction wise, unfortunately I don't have a lot of experience with this so I can't help much.

There is.  Nodes can rebroadcast transactions to the network which will keep them alive.  Unfortunately nodes have no idea how old a transaction is when its first received, they only keep track of how long they have it for.  So it could last forever.  but I believe it will be dropped at some point. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 01:40:13

From what I understand (and Keep in mind, I'm not confident in what I understand)   Increasing the block size Opens up he network to possible attack vectors.
I also believe it would cause Full nodes to cost more to run.  
I have nothing to back any of these statements up, so take it as hearsay.

@_date: 2017-12-16 15:44:31
Further segwit adoption will help a bit, but not much.  Any major price movement will always cause transactions to skyrocket.
Lightning is what most are saying will solve the issue.  I would be confident that all the devs are working on scaling solutions as that is the major bottleneck of the network at the moment. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 20:02:59
I'll try to explain:
Market orders are immediately filled, you're taking away bitcoins being offered from other users using the same exchange, because of this you are considered a Taker (you're taking away liquidity from The exchange). Takers are charged a fee.
Limit orders are you telling the exchange "I want X bitcoin at Y price". 
An example : buy 2 Bitcoin at $16500.
Limit orders give you more control, and ensure that you are getting Bitcoin at a specific price you chose.  The main drawback though is if the price moves away from your limit order it may never fill.
Exchanges is generally reward people that use limit orders with either free trades or very limited fees because it's giving liquidity to their Exchange.  If there were no limit orders there would be no order book and no way for people to make trades.
I hope this helped a little, I think I'm going to make a YouTube video to make this a lot easier to explain.
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:19:42
It's possible, I wouldn't rule it out completely.  In fact I would say it's more than likely especially if Bitcoin Remains the top dog in cryptocurrency and solves the scaling issue.

Looks like its possible,  but only if your creating a raw transaction yourself.   I suggest using a new wallet address in this case,  it should give you the same result without any risk.

You can pay a higher fee and be in the next block.  Still just as liquid.
@_date: 2017-12-15 20:48:04
Bitcoin transactions are made up of inputs (what your sending) and outputs.  Wallets normally hold these inputs and when you create a new transaction, wallets will find the best way to send them for you in the cheapest way possible (more inputs means larger transaction size, meaning you'll end up paying more)
Because of this there is normally something called a "change address" involved in a transaction.  Most of the time you wont have the perfect inputs youll need so your wallet takes one input and breaks it into 2 outputs.  One goes to the address your sending too, and the other goes back to your wallet (the change address)  
If you add these outputs togeather they will be less than what you sent, the missing amount of bitcoin is your fee you paid to the miners.  In this case 0.00094294 BTC 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:46:08
sure sure CAN.  But its not profitable.  Its more of a hobby thing now.  If you still want to mine, knowing you will lose money, not gain money.  Then I suggest heading to r/BitcoinMining

@_date: 2017-12-14 22:09:41
Highly debated.  Keep records of everything (USD value of assets when traded) and the date to be safe.  I'm sure if you directly ask the IRS they would say it's taxable event but I'm not the IRS nor a tax attorney.  I would err on the side of caution.
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:39:46
I can't even begin to speculate.
But if the price of Bitcoin starts to Flatline you should be set.  Sadly that doesn't look probable in the short term but I wouldn't rule it out.

Fees remain high even after the mem pool starts to die down, it's a flaw of many wallets.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:54:30
Yes it is taxable.  Your cost basis is 0, so the full amount will be taxed. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 03:05:01
Gdax Covers the fee. So no need to worry.
@_date: 2017-12-15 02:28:26

Your transaction might be stuck however for the next two weeks,  but Your coins will be in your wallet.  :)
@_date: 2017-12-14 23:40:40
Bad news, the fee for this transactions way too low.  10 satoshis per byte.  You'll have to wait for a lowland transactions for this to confirm or get lucky and actually have a minor help you out.
As for the two outputs of this transaction, Bitcoin transactions are made of inputs and outputs.   Your input is 0.43177384, but obviously this isn't what you wanted to send, so it's broken into 2 outputs, the amount you're sending and the remaining change.  That change is heading back to your wallet which is what that address is, your change address.
@_date: 2017-12-23 22:12:33

@_date: 2017-12-15 00:30:03
So there is a chance!
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:53:20
Your fee isn't horrible.  If you give it time it most likely will confirm. This assumes that transactions start to die out in the next few days and we start to make progress on the mempool.  Which is entirely possible, unless the price decides to continue to be a rollercoaster, which is also entirely possible.
Sadly I've never used any other transaction accelerator service other than the one you listed so I can't provide you any advice.
@_date: 2017-12-14 23:54:40
Also, you could set it to be a limit order when triggered,  but a market order is better if you want to ensure you get out of the position.

It can be, to be honest I'm not exactly positive and it could also depend on which wallet software you're using.  But do make sure that your .03 Bitcoin ends up back in your original wallet, if it doesn't there is something wrong.
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:54:28
The fact that it goes against the TOS is why the IRS wouldn't care about it.  But I bet if you recorded the USD value of that gold to the IRS and paid taxes on it, the IRS wouldn't argue.
Bitcoin or really any cryptocurrency for that matter doesn't go against a TOS for trading it for money or Goods / services.    I think there's a fundamental difference between Bitcoin and WOW gold.
For instance bartering still exist in the world, I shadowed an accountant way back in my schooling days and she had to convert the value of a dentist's services that was traded for some goods so they could be recorded and eventually taxed.

OK thats good, however you could have a little less money as well.  Would that be ok ?  If so then go for it.  If not I would just hold onto it and have the money on hand when you go. 
also keep in mind any gains you get will be subject to capital gains tax.  
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:14:43

Well I agree with the investing part, why can't people talk about Bitcoin if they don't understand the technology?  Shouldn't they ask questions? Are we some kind of religious group that only allow those who seek out the answers themselves to join.
Ecosystem would not be this big if people weren't just diving into the price rise over the years, some of those people will learn about the technology and understand Bitcoin through and through and most likely will stick with it.  Some won't.  No need to dictate what those people can and can't do.  
@_date: 2017-12-16 14:14:48
It's all very possible.  Don't invest more than you willing to lose. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 17:21:15
Most likely stuck for now, but with scaling Solutions like lightning you might be able to move it in the future.
@_date: 2017-12-14 20:39:44
Honestly that's the easiest thing you can do.  Your CPA will love you if you just keep track of every transaction where you move from Bitcoin into any other asset from USD to any other cryptocurrency. Just make sure you record the value that you traded in USD and the date and they should have no problem.
@_date: 2017-12-31 08:12:48
The moment you sell that Bitcoin it becomes a taxable event.  It doesn't matter if you've held it for 1 day 1 year or 40 years you will pay taxes.  
The fact that you have a joint account with your parents will not matter, it's your Bitcoin, the burden to pay taxes is on you.
@_date: 2017-12-25 00:42:48
Correct, 80 sat/b is not enough.

You only need to report any earnings you made after selling.  If you haven't sold anything yet then there are no taxable event and you don't have to worry about taxes. (Assuming this is in the USA)
The moment you sell though you have to calculate how much profit you made (final amount - cost). And then figure out how long you held the asset for.  If it was over a year you pay less, under a year you pay more.

So if you own your private keys you'll have access to all the new coins in the future, however just because someone forks Bitcoins code and gives it a new name doesn't mean that new coin will be worth anything.  Most of the upcoming forks will be worthless or close to it.  Still if you want to take part the best thing to do is have bitcoin in a wallet where you control the Private keys.

Your luck there's work around but just for coinbase users.
Coinbase owns and exchange called gdax, if you're able to open up an account with them you can withdraw for free and you can transfer funds from coinbase to gdax for free as well.
You can also use gdax to buy Bitcoin at a much better rate, with less fees or no fees.
So open a gdax account if you can, I have no idea how long this process takes so I'm sorry if it doesn't happen in time.  After that transfer your Bitcoin from coinbase to gdax and then withdraw from gdax directly into your paper wallet for free.

I'm glad to hear that you're looking into storage solutions first but you can keep Bitcoin on an exchange after buying it.  Both coinbase and Gemini are fantastic exchanges if you're based in the United States.  And I don't see either of them going anywhere anytime soon.
As for the wallet choice, I think bitcoin.com supports Bitcoin cash which is different from Bitcoin. 
Unfortunately I don't have a Mac so I can't tell you which wallet is best.

I believe all kinds only offer high-speed internet money because of low use.  Some of them may have faster transaction times, but it would be curious to see just how all of them work in a standardized environment.
As far as I know(I don't know much) no coin has figured out how to scale, but there are a ton of things in the pipeline.  It will be interesting moving forward.

I never used a ledger so check the instructions given or online documentation.  But fantastic job making sure your back up system works.  I would have done it before the coins were transferred, but I'm paranoid.
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:06:19
 40.419 sat/B 
This is far too low for these times.  
You can beg a miner to add the transaction to their next block
You can pay a accelerator service to do the same. 
You can wait for it to hopefully drop from the network, but there is no guarantee that will happen.
You can wait for the back log to get handled and it will be mined.  
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:02:00
Nice!  My office was not as receptive and they still resent me even with the price increase.  I'm just not talking about it anymore unless someone else brings it up.
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:43:22
They certainly did.  Enjoy. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 22:16:17
From what you told me the only information you have is your wallet address. Seeing has addresses are public information it would be a poor design if this allowed you access to your coins.
I'm not familiar with desktop wallets however so maybe it's possible there is some way to login to a account, but I am quite certain most wallet store all the information locally on your computer.  So if you no longer have that computer and you didn't transfer your wallet files over you won't have access anymore.
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:07:16
New Cycles like this are always going to happen.  Same with price increases and decreases in Bitcoin
I'm just confused as to why you're pointing it out, or what specifically is bothering you about it.
@_date: 2017-12-14 22:57:03
If it requires more confirmations then yes it will probably be just a matter of time.  Sun systems take a little bit longer to recognize a confirmation as well, it all depends on which node they are grabbing their information from.
@_date: 2017-12-14 20:51:07
Yes you want to keep track of both.   Your initial costs are very important, these do include any fees you were charged as well so keep that in mind.  The technical term is cost basis, that includes all fees and cost for the asset that you acquired.
 You want to keep track of the amount of Bitcoin because you may not sell the entire amount in the future all at once.  Example is if you only sell half of your original amount that you purchased.  You still holding on to part of the  original purchase, and this becomes even more important if you continue to purchase Bitcoin.  Then you have to start applying things like first in first out or last in first out, which becomes confusing.
Just record how much money you spend on bitcoin and the amount of Bitcoin that you have and the date.  Then anytime you sell Bitcoin record the amount that you received how much Bitcoin you sold and the date.  
If you're trading for other cryptocurrencies, take the amount of Bitcoin that you traded and convert that to the value of US dollars and record it along with the date.
If you do all of this a tax professional should be able to tell you how much you owe in taxes.

Don't fix it if it ain't broken 
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:51:06
They don't!  They have to pay them,   GDAX just covers the fees for its users that withdraw.  It most likely will not last forever, although if they start using segwit it would really help the network out.  
@_date: 2017-12-14 22:10:25
Oh it's a shit post!

Making transactions does not equate to being happy with the speed or cost of those transactions.  
But I shouldn't be making sweeping generalizations for the user base of Bitcoin.  
@_date: 2017-12-15 20:38:38
While using it to transact with would be best, we are not at a point where the network is mature enough to support that well.  Once scaling is figured out more merchants should start accepting Bitcoin and then you can actually use it.
I personally believe buying and holding is the best thing you can do at this point.

This post might get removed just because it mentions BCH. 
The topic is very divisive.

No your probably right.  But we are still at the start of this new technology.  The winner hasnt been chosen and everyone is placings their bets on which currency will be number 1.  
Also most coins have their own special niche, not every coin can do everything (yet)
@_date: 2017-12-25 05:52:31
I don't use Gemini but I hear that your first 30 Bitcoin transactions every month are free.

@_date: 2017-12-20 04:55:04
No, but it shouldnt take longer than a hour or two.  Coinbase/GDAX pays good fees and generally are included in the next block.  But Gemini may need a few confirmations.  Also you'll need a Gemini account (duh)

So if I make Boobcoin and have it copy the bitcoin blockchain so your private keys can move coins on my boobcoin blockchain, do you think that would effect the value of bitcoin?  
Anyone can copy a blockchain, but without a network behind it, and a clear purpose and road map its just a waste of time and energy.  
So no, these new forks will not crush the price of bitcoin.  They are just money grabs most likely.  
You'll gain the same amount of the new forked coins as you own on the current block chain. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 01:19:30
Sadly that's too low for the current back log.  You need to be 500+

All the miners?  I feel like there would still be miners trying on the bitcoin chain no matter what.  unless the project was abandoned by everyone, in which case who cares what happens. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:12:15
Correct, no fee to move to GDAX, no fee to move it to your paper wallet, just follow the video I posted and it will explain everything.  
With GDAX you just have to wait for your funds to get to the exchange before you can buy.  So you would start a ACH transfer and then about a week later the funds wil be available.  GDAX will let you know when them money is there.  So yes there is still a delay, but GDAX has lower fees (0.25% instead of 1% on coinbase)   And can actually be free as well.  (using limit orders, there is no fee)  
@_date: 2017-12-14 20:10:34
I respect that you realize you should know more.  However I would highly suggest before investing you should learn about the asset that you're investing in, not after.
Your question a little vague, I have no idea what your scope of knowledge is on the subject to begin with, but my first suggestion would be to go to YouTube and watch some videos on bitcoin.  From those videos search for anything specific that someone might mention that you want to learn more about.  If you hit any dead ends you can post on Reddit  with specific questions and hopefully we'll be able to answer them for you.
If you have any specific questions now I can try to answer them for you.
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:17:48


This one.  
Though I'm not sure how electrum works.  do they have a 12 word seed?  If so you might have to convert that into a standard private key.   
Not sure how much help I'll be from this point.  
@_date: 2017-12-15 20:16:21
Well at that point are the big players even using bitcoin?  I feel like they would be long gone.
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:31:41
Nodes hold the blockchain.  Blocks are just groups of transactions that miners confirmed.  When a miner confirms a block it's broadcast to the network and added to the blockchain.
This process continues forever.  
I'm not familiar enough with cryptocurrencies that don't have a blockchain so I can't really answer that part.
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:39:53
Any United States exchange is going to be subject to know your customer regulations and anti-money-laundering regulations (KYC, AML)
So the short answer to your question is no. All the legitimate exchanges will require information such as Social Security numbers or other identifying things.
I think I heard bitstamp has free withdrawals but I've never used them so take that as hearsay until you can confirm it yourself.
Gdax would be your best option and I know that they are free to transfer off of.  Lots of hate flying around for coinbase, but the exchange works for a good on ramp that's free to transfer from.
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:02:47
This,  Its not a big difference. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 23:44:53
Do you have any information such as the website you signed up on?  Or perhaps the long string of numbers and letters you wrote down? ( Don't post that here as it may be a private key and you'd be giving away your Bitcoin)

I wish you the best luck!  Happy holidays
@_date: 2017-12-17 18:12:24
I wouldn't call it a catch all.  It may be unique to you until its filled, or it might always be unique to you.  But after funds are moved there, they can be spent by the private key (owned by the exchange) to either move to cold storage form the hot wallet or maybe sent as a withdraw for another user. That receiving address is most likely one of thousands that one private key controls.  
But I'm just assuming here.  
@_date: 2017-12-23 04:24:07
Honestly watching all of them is a good start.
Sadly can't recommend just one.
@_date: 2017-12-30 16:53:47
Did the person provide you a transaction ID?
This all sounds very fishy.  What were the terms of this deal? Where did you meet this person and arrange this?
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:04:00
Your feet so hard because you have 10 inputs which made your transaction size much bigger (taking up more space in a block, hence the fee)
You're fees around a 140 sat/b which during normal circumstances should confirm.  However there's a very large transaction backlog and so your actually underpaying.
You have two options, wait and hope that the transaction backlog is dealt with and eventually this will get mined.  Or you can use a transaction accelerator service, I know of one free one but there may be others.
Every hour they allow 100 transactions to be accelerated, these fill up quickly so you literally have to be waiting on that website at the top of the hour and submit it when it rolls over to a new hour.  
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:48:15
@_date: 2017-12-15 00:37:25
Honestly I think people would love that.  The amount of money needed to do this would be astronomical.  
At first we wouldn't know,  but as the price rose less and less coins would be available, so price would continue to rise,  more coins may be sold but I dont think an entity could do this.  It costs too much and wouldn't really solve much.  
What would stop us from making bitcoin 2?  Or forking the network to have newer units of bitcoin  (32 decimal places)  so we could use the remaining 1000 coins?   
This isn't something you should worry about.  but I sure hope a bank is dumb enough to attempt this.  
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:11:23
I don't use that Exchange.  But I do not believe it is free.
Also I believe they charge a fee when trading, GDAX does not if you use limit orders.

ViaBTC is what I've used in the past, but the mempool was much lower.
No generally will hold onto a transaction for 2 weeks.  Some notes will rebroadcast transactions some don't. Regardless I think you'll be fine and I wouldn't worry too much.  I've heard stories of transactions falling off the mempool recently, so it does happen.
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:20:44
I'm not sure the IRS would agree.  I can still see them wanting you to pay taxes of the USD value when earning / spending BTC.  But I don't work for the IRS and I'm not a tax professional.
@_date: 2017-12-19 17:37:16
It's he still part of the bitcoin space?
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:05:46
you'll need to set up on a exchange.  Unless you use local bitcoins or something, unsure if they support Bcash.
@_date: 2017-12-14 19:45:29
You have to consider that they probably just on-boarded thousands of new customers and all those customers need to be verified.  It's an unfortunate byproduct of the regulatory laws that coinbase has to abide by.
@_date: 2017-12-14 20:34:47
This is when things get a little tricky.  Technically when you sold your BTC for XMR that could be considered a taxable event.  I'm not a tax professional so don't quote me on that.  But I'm almost certain if the IRS came knocking on your door they would consider it a taxable event.  Meaning you'd have to convert the value of your Bitcoin that you traded for the XMR into US dollars and then subtract the cost of those coins when you originally bought them to figure out how much tax you have to pay on them.  
Meanwhile you have to figure out the USD value of you XMR at that time so whenever you either traded for different currency or sell it you would know how much you should pay in tax taxes.
Yay taxes.

How the hell is this transaction still in the mempool.  Transactions should expire after 2 weeks.  
OP please check the wallet you sent from and see if you have the option for "child pays for parent"  This may help you.   Your fee is too small for any free transaction accelerator that I know of to help.  There are paid services for this, but I am not familiar with them.

@_date: 2017-12-21 19:07:23
I wouldn't really call it spam and has a high enough fee to be confirmed in the next block.  Most spam transactions use lower fees so they stick around. 
Well I can't think of a reason to send Bitcoin to the same address that you just sent it from, that doesn't necessarily mean there isn't a reason to do this. Very strange though.

Depending on how many you have you might want to look into Hardware wallets.  While they come with a cost the ease of use and the security they provide cannot be beat.
If you're looking for a software wallet, check the sidebar as there are many options.

Gdax is the only trick. You can either pay the fees or hope they verify you on gdax.
Or hope that they Implement something that reduces their fees such as Segwit.  But I wouldn't hold my breath.

You can always buy bitcoin and withdraw that, might be simpler.  
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:26:23
If you transfer your coins to a wallet, they are now under your control and only your control (assuming its a wallet you have private keys too)  
You then have the option to send it anywhere you want, so yes you could send it back to coinbase to sell, or anywhere else that allows you to sell. 
Please keep in mind though you'll have to pay to transfer the coins out of coinbase and back to coinbase.  Bitcoin miners do not work for free confirming your transactions.  Currently fees are very high, so keep that in mind.
