Sounds like he has one of those “top up £20, get 500 minutes, unlimited texts and 10GB of internet” type plans, where the £20 credit (or some of it) gets carried over if you don’t use it
So basically, if you can buy Bitcoin with the credit using mobile billing payments, you get your phone plan discounted or even free.
The phone companies work on the assumption you’ll top up more than you’d otherwise spend monthly and then every few months will spend it all in one big splurge on overpriced data

I’m not buying, as I sold off perhaps 2/3 of my holdings in Jan/Feb when I decided the stress of watching the price wasn’t worth it and it was about time for me to take some profits.
Roughly speaking, the 1/3 I have left invested is what I’m comfortable with, after taking that profit, so that’s true “HODL” money, and putting much more back in would make me overinvested again
That said, with the current prices, and having done some work to my house with the 2/3 I withdrew, I’m about ready to start buying in again slowly. The original plan was to buy a little each month, but last year got so crazy that I went in a bit heavily and made a ton more than I expected. It’s starting to feel like that craziness is mostly over, though, and it’s time to start looking at the long game again.
So yeah, next payday will likely see me return to $50-100/mo purchases, but nothing much more exciting than that.

Bitmain can likely 51% attack Bitcoin anyway - they control several of the largest pools, and they’re the only real producer of mining hardware.
They also appear to have made a good chunk of profit lately, enough that they can afford to stop selling hardware temporarily 
All they’d need to do is stop selling ASICs for a while to build up a stockpile of hashpower: they wouldn’t need to accumulate 51%, Just the 10% or so to bridge the gap between what they currently control.

It’s typically more about
1. Not sending a scan of your passport across the Internet. We’ve all seen youvebeenpwned.com, does anyone trust internet companies with our security anymore?
2. Not having ID - either because you’re young, or just because you don’t have ID. Most people do, but not everyone

Safe: depends on the site. Some are legit, some are scams. You should generally be okay with the bigger, better established sites
Legal: depends on your jurisdiction - if Bitcoin is legal in your country/state, mining it is likely legal too. Your biggest legal question is likely to be tax laws
Profitable: almost certainly not. I’ve had a few mining contracts for 18 months or so since I got involved with Crypto, and I’ve still only seen about 60% of that amount returned ($ value) on any of them, even with the last 12 months being fairly profitable for crypto mining. I’m not too upset since I only bought a few $30 contracts to see how they worked and what the return was like, but I certainly can’t recommend it.
If you want to invest in Crypto, you’re almost certainly better off buying the coins directly than buying mining contracts. Mining margins, particularly for Bitcoin, are thin anyway - by the time the cloud mining takes enough of a cut to be profitable, there’s basically nothing left for you. I’ve had an average payout of perhaps a dollar a month on each $30 contract, so about $18-20 return so far including the more profitable summer, and $0 profit... while $30 of Bitcoin bought 18 months ago is worth about $300 now. Obviously last year is an unusual one with the crazy price rises, but mining profits were up too.
I doubt I’ll even break even on the 2 year contracts. And if the lifetime ones were truly lifetime, I’d buy some to have the permanent little trickle of Bitcoin income. But even the lifetime ones generally have a fixed fee and are therefore basically guaranteed to stop being profitable after a couple of years, because a fixed fee can’t ever keep up with a rising difficulty. They might just about break even, but I’m not expecting a profit on them.
I really can’t recommend a cloud mining contract.

Nope - you can get special shape ones for certain cars
Those dimensions are typical for European cars, where we have longer, thinner number plates.
Lamborghini doesn’t make a separate panel for the US market, so you have a choice of a more expensive plate, or your US plate looking silly on your $250k HyperCard... which do you choose?

It was a hypothetical question: clearly anyone with $250k to spend on a supercar is likely to spend the $200 for a plate that fits
