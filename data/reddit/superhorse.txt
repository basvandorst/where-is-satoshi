The government can already print an unlimited amount of money.  Why the fuck would they care about mining Bitcoin?

Another reason to use amazon.com instead of overstock.com:

The feminist and SJW crowd that are to blame.  They use Twitter as a platform to bully people and things they don't like.  They find out where you work (if it's not already obvious) and then harass your employer as well - either leading to you being fired or having to give an apology.

How many more months can he drain the account at this rate?  There's your answer.

To be fair, she is likely shaken and nervous because she pissed the internet off. Imagine the emails and private messages she is getting. It would shake anyone up.

Some of the people in this community are the same people that donated the money.


Pretty sure I just implied that he is laundering it.  Can you read?

A lot of people argue that Theymos is laundering that large sum of donated money.  **He is bleeding it dry 100k/mo at a time to have custom forum software written**... There are literally 100 established code projects for forums, probably more.  Why reinvent the wheel, and at that extremely high cost?  Hell, with this logic why don't they write their own operating system as well, so it can be super efficient at handling requests? /s
I've followed the GitHub account of the new forum - the developers push out tiny code changes each day, something that anyone who is actually talented could do in under an hour.  What i'm saying is: the amount of work done is very minimal, even for one person working on it - let along the supposed team of 4.  **It's a fucking scam.**

You sir ~~are a moron~~ have done something foolish.

Maybe if aesthetics were a factor in mining...

Fake. OP is a faggot.

Source on this?

Laughing pretty hard at this.  Take a look in the mirror bro.

There have been a lot of shitty posts in this sub-reddit lately, and this isn't one of them.  I enjoyed your write-up and video!
@_date: 2013-12-18 22:50:46
I can look at your post history too!






My original assumption checks out.
@_date: 2013-12-18 19:05:36
Exactly, posts like this are giving them tremendous satisfaction.  When you show a troll that you're mad, you've lost.

Misleading title.  They paid $750 ransom which got converted to Bitcoin - not 750 Bitcoins.  That amount would be obscene.
@_date: 2013-12-18 18:37:00
Of course trolls will be trolling when a great opportunity presents itself.  Try and get some thicker skin and don't take the internet so personally.
