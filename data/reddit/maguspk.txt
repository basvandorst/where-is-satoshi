You fundamentally misunderstand mining. This post should be thoroughly down voted. These values are not arbitrary they were chosen with speed and security in mind with balance as a goal. You cannot mint a block just because you want to it’s based entirely on random chance and the event is controlled by probability. It isn’t and will never be related to the number of pending transactions.

No each block is 12.5 BTC so that is roughly $135,000 USD at current exchange rates.

It isn’t a thing you can easily quantify. Network decentralization matters because it is literally the only way to achieve Byzantine fault tolerance in network of untrusted actors. It’s inherent in the nature of the solution to the problem Bitcoin solves.

Core has done a lot of research and experimentation with block size and network propagation. It is extremely naiive, and unfortunately extremely common, to think increasing blocksize is a “obvious solution”.
There are factors to consider such as time for a block to transmit, implications of time to mine etc. Bigger blocks actually can favor larger centralized mining operations because finding a block means you can start finding the next block sooner, before anyone else is able to (because they must first receive the block).

Don't trust anyone with your BTC, period. The technology is here for you to remain in CONTROL of your money. You do NOT need to give anyone full control of your bitcoins and it should be a red flag when you do!

Your assumption is that everyone agrees buying illicit drugs is crime worthy. It largely isn’t, many rational people disagree strongly that the government should have any say on the products one chooses to ingest.

Simplest reply I can give is just because something is illegal does not mean there is absolute consensus it is wrong. There is always room for interpretation and there are a lot of people who believe and could be convinced selling drugs online should not be illegal.

This does not truly compete with either of those services. Take a closer look, the video never mentions that one might have access to the BTC. It is abstracted away from the user almost entirely except in the form of an exchange rate. 
@_date: 2014-05-22 18:26:12
Technically speaking it is because it's easier to store a BTC value and then use a single 'true' exchange rate to convert to USD. If they wanted to show the value at transaction time, they would either need an API for getting the BTC price for a given time, or modify their transaction datastore to also store the exchange rate at the time of the transaction.

What seems to be the case is that the user only interacts with fiat. You can deposit into Circle and transact and withdraw, but there is no option to deposit BTC or withdraw BTC. This makes some sense because otherwise a user could abscond from their walled garden after abuse. 
It could also be the case that they plan to make money on the value of BTC rising. For example, you deposit into Circle, $200 dollars. Maybe if BTC rises 25% they pocket that and you still have $200 and not $250 dollars. After all, since you are only interacting with fiat values, this makes sense. I realize this goes both directions but they are obviously betting on a rise given their space and mission. 
So it seems BTC is a transaction layer and they are using it to facilitate the space. They compete with Paypal, Square, etc. They do not seem to compete with wallet services or exchanges, e.g. Blockchain, Coinbase, etc.

Let me try to give you analogy because you seem to thing you understand but you don't. 
There are sheets of paper with really cool designs on them. We all agree on one particular design and give it to the paper manufacturer to produce mass market and distribute as shredded bits of confetti. The manufacturer then modified a small section of the paper design before making and shredding the paper to production. End result? Nobody knows the manufacturer changed the paper because the shredding process obscures his change. 
There is not a way to have consensus like you suggest because of the nature of the App Store. Your use case is far to specific and paranoid to have a place in a modern day App Store and ass a result the simpler alternative "one party submits a single app" is the prevalent one.

Actually you are right, it seems more likely they will just charge a % fee on top of their exchange rate and call it a day. You could always send BTC to your own wallet to get it off Circle.

If you aren't using purse.io or a similar service you are really missing out. I consistently get 33% off any purchase on Amazon by using bitcoin. 
Unless you enjoy paying a 33% premium on your purchases by using fiat, using bitcoin just makes more sense.

Bought a GoPro Hero 3+ Black, iPad Air 64GB and various other things like makeup, Camelbak, etc.
The coolest part was we used the Air and GoPro for a trip to Japan and after returning we sold them for a profit on...Amazon.
Ended up making about 50-100$ on each sale. At this point I could care less about the fraud that likely powers a lot of these transactions because the onus is on Amazon and I am just glad to get my huge discounts and use bitcoin.

Please do not spread misinformation. The third key is stored, by default with a third party provider, not Case. Additionally, you can opt to use your own private key during the setup process by supplying a public key and storing the private key yourself.

BIP45 is implemented so it will have hierarchical deterministic address generation. Most likely this means a new receive address (public) can or will be generated at some point(s) in time after wallet creation.

After the redesign I am unable to view order pages for ongoing transactions. I received my items but I am unable to confirm the shipment.

The third key can be generated yourself, independent of Case, the default third party and your Case device. Meaning it is sufficiently air gapped from the rest of the parties in the multisig assuming you exercise some basic security when generating the third key.

It would probably help if you understood BIP45 but the private keys are not transmitted. Each party in the 2-of-3 multisig shares a special kind of public key which is used to keep the clients in sync regarding address generation. The private keys never leave the respective parties, just a public key. So each party can generate the addresses for the other parties but only the party can sign for that party.

This really isn't true at all, just because a language is 'slower' doing a class of things than another language doesn't mean it's strictly inferior. It's such a narrow view of software development, it's sad so many people make this mistake. There is a reason people choose Python and it isn't because they aren't educated or poor programmers. Look at companies who use Python in production code today, Dropbox. Google, Quora, etc. These are not groups of people who are poor engineers and you are making a classic mistake novice programmers, not Computer Scientists, make. Please consider all things, network, latency, I/O, etc. within the context of CPU cycles, bounds and then the execution of code. Stop spreading misinformation.

Like he said, performance issues are due to implementation and have nothing to do with Python. Python is a language, it cannot be 'slow'.

This reeks of ignorance. For one, a language cannot be slow. Python has many runtimes. CPython, JPython, etc.


What task is that exactly? Guess what, Python is fine, a particular implementation can be good or bad.
