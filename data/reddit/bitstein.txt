But *how*? My answer is by utilizing State power to enact regulations and create endless supplies of fiat money. By contrast, look at what happens to shady financial institutions such as Mt. Gox that operate in a more free market environment. They face consequences.


Sure, Bitcoin is great for everyone. I would simply argue that non-libertarians are ignoring the social implications of Bitcoin. It seems like they want a revolution without a revolution. They want to sell WhatsApp for $16B and call it disruptive. The Bitcoin protocol is a radically different way to organize consensus on a network, and it is a very libertarian way at that. It mimics scarcity and individual private property ownership.

Very true. In fact, humanity was able to do that for millennia.
But this is sort of a non sequitur. Money is a good whose quality depends on a sound protocol across the entire network that uses that good. Economists since Aristotle have recognized certain qualities that make a good money. Since 2009, we've known that the Bitcoin block chain is the very best way to capture these qualities (see:  And this is true despite the high costs of agreeing on a distributed database. We know theoretically and historically the downfalls of having anything less. Gold standards are akin to monetary constitutionalism, full of security holes. Fiat currencies are security exploits by definition. Having to pay for bandwidth, storage, and time to have a functioning block chain are not only worth it, but I would argue necessary, to having any sort of truly sound money.
Stock markets, though? The benefits of a block chain hardly outweigh the costs. First, not everyone in a network needs to verify that a trade I was involved in went through. Why would I want my computer to have to keep watch on the NYSE? Fraud in a stock market trade I'm in does not affect me directly. Those within the trade should be paying the costs of verifying it. Second, the time to confirm a transaction is much too long for stock markets. Stock market trades must be able to happen rapidly. Block chains cannot do this while also guaranteeing the security of the transaction. Third, stock market trades do not need to be publicly available to outsiders. They just don't. If you were able to solve 2 or 3, you would have a serious competitor to Bitcoin.
The better answer for a stock market would be a platform like Open Transactions. You get to back your instruments with Bitcoin, have rapid high-volume trade all cryptographically secure, and only those with access to the server get to be involved and only they have to pay the costs.
Block chains are good for protocols that truly require network consensus. Money is one of these protocols. Stock markets are not.

I spoke with him about Bitcoin shortly before this talk ( He told me he "loves the principles, but [doesn't] understand the technology." As he mentioned in the speech, he thinks if it were serious competition, the government would have probably tried to do something about it by now.
I told him how Washington doesn't quite seem to understand why Bitcoin would be a serious threat yet, mostly because they are too stuck with their monetary policy ideology:
* In [this report]( by the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, they cling tightly to the State theory of money and even think Bitcoin somehow conflicts with Hayek's monetary theory because it is a "quasi-monopoly" in the crypto-currency market, and that there isn't a single private enterprise issuing the currency.
* In [this report]( [PDF] by the Congressional Research Service, they have a section entitled "The System’s Long-Term Deflationary Bias Will Discourage Its Use as Currency," which shows their biases towards monetary institutes that redistributes wealth to them (and ability to induce Stockholm Syndrome into those having their wealth redistributed away from them). The market, when given a choice, has the opposite biases, of course.
In all, I'm very happy to see this is how Dr. Paul views crypto-currencies. He is not a tech person, so there will be obvious deficiencies in his analyses. However, he is a principled man, and he knows good principles when he sees them.

Obviously. My point is not that non-libertarians can't see that Bitcoin is special. I'm arguing that non-libertarians can not fully appreciate Bitcoin on a social, political, or economic level. Konrad Graf did a fantastic job outlining the full implications of Bitcoin here: 
From every angle, Bitcoin is libertarian through and through. In order for non-libertarians to appreciate Bitcoin, it seems they have to cherry-pick aspects of it. For instance, they will say they like it as a payment system but not as a currency. This is for a variety of reasons, but it contradicts Bitcoin's very nature, since the payment system and currency are the same thing. Likewise, you pointed out how people can like Bitcoin but still be okay with taxation. In a sense that is fine, but if the whole world were run on Bitcoin, taxation would have to be completely voluntary. This is more akin to a libertarian view of government rather than a more mainstream one, given taxation is by definition non-voluntary.
I hope non-libertarians embrace Bitcoin. It benefits everyone, except monopolistic money producers and their friends. In fact, I hope for non-libertarians it is a gateway drug to peaceful anarchism.

Alexis, no one is against consumer protection measures. The question is who will provide it. To ask organizations such as the Federal government to provide these services risks increasing costs of entry. This is disastrous in many ways. If you need help understanding why, I'd be happy to explain in detail.
What you should be asking for are people to self-regulate. Remember, Bitcoin is 100% a "push" system. Businesses can only engage with customers if the customer completely *voluntarily* agrees to submit *any* transaction. In such an environment, reputation is king, and it can be lost in an instant. It is not the government that can improve the customer experience with Bitcoin. It is the developers of wallet software and security measures and the businessmen themselves who must exhibit extreme professionalism if they wish to remain in business.
On the flip side, Bitcoin requires that people be more responsible with their money. No one else can be for them. With this comes the responsibility to be more cautious with the businesses they choose to interact with. Caveat emptor. And that's a feature, not a bug.
tl;dr - Please do not invite thugs to our peaceful experiment.

Hi, Michael Goldstein here. I'm the co-founder of the Mises Circle, and I'm the one who edits and hits the publish button on the website.
I'm sorry that you were so offended, about our use of the Scrooge McDuck imagery on this article. For decades, Scrooge McDuck has been both playfully and maliciously the butt of many jokes concerning money, banking, and greed. Hoarding, you see, is not a very popular behavior in our world, including the Bitcoin world (as you can see below). That is why Daniel was kind enough to write a wonderful article liberating the act of hoarding from its public scorn, showing how it is actually the wellspring of economic growth. Praise be the hoarders! (And the hoadrs for that matter.)
I know ducks have long been persecuted for their real and/or perceived monetary practices, but whether or not they all actually hoard like Scrooge McDuck, our hope was that this article would show that people should be *more* like Scrooge. The world would be a much better place if people saved more, and Bitcoin's success would happen at an even faster rate.
I hope you understand.
Disclosure: I am well known to be a duck myself, as my name suggests, and I have experienced many of the jokes you associate with that image of Scrooge diving into his room of Casascius coins. "Where're your duckcoins, Duckstein?" "Yea, don't all ducks have tons of duckcoins? You control all the duckbanks anyhow." I'd always hope I'd find ways to counter these negative perceptions of myself and fellow ducks, and I really thought this article would be a step forward. C'est la vie. I guess it isn't rabbit season.
But speaking of that, here's a picture of me at a coffeeshop in Teal Aviv, the best city in the Holy Duck Land, that accepted duckcoins. I didn't spend much, though, because I wanted to hoard as many as possible.

They are not the same. Bitcoin requires network consensus because otherwise it is not useful as a money. A stock just needs an issuer who has enough reputation to mitigate counterparty risk. Using a block chain to issue stocks does not remove the counterparty risk. Bitcoin on the other hand is self-referential and does not have any counterparty risk.

The fact that money has in the past been easily manipulated is damning to the specific monetary technologies, not the concept of money itself. Money is an incredible tool for reciprocal altruism. I would recommend reading Nick Szabo's ["Shelling Out: The Origins of Money"]( on that topic.
Bitcoin gives us a real opportunity for truly sound money, which puts an end to the security holes that worry you. And while I probably disagree with you about what constitutes unfair employment practices, I would say that as a technology Bitcoin allows for much more diverse methods of transactions, which allows employers and employees to be much more entrepreneurial in the contracts they wish to create and engage in.

I prefer letting Bitcoin tell its own narrative. A forerunner to Bitcoin was Wei Dai's b-money protocol (see footnote 1 of Satoshi's whitepaper). His post to the Cypherpunk mailing list did not begin by listing the merits of a frictionless payment system, even though that was very much a component of the protocol. Instead he made reference to Tim May's work and how such a money protocol could be used to help for crypto-anarchic communities.




As points out, the rules of the protocol clearly choose policies typically espoused by anarcho-capitalists and other advocates of sound money, rather than supporters of central banking and other governmental monetary institutions.
Different parts of the story appeal to different people, and you should tell that story accordingly. Don't act like the other parts do not exist though. If and when those people who get into Bitcoin are interested to know *why* it works as a protocol, it will be Austrian economics and libertarian legal theory that best informs them, not any statist policy or philosophy.

You could, sure, but there would be no economic reason to do so. Fractional reserve notes are not somehow more liquid than bitcoins themselves, nor do they lower any transaction costs. Banking as you conceive it is an obsolete technology. You will be hard-pressed to find anyone on this subreddit arguing that you should even store more than nominal amounts of bitcoins with a third party, let alone one that issues debt-bearing instruments that anyone would recognize as equivalent to a bitcoin. Plus, based on the nature of Bitcoin, any fractional reserve bank would be fully auditable on-the-fly, which would only make their scheme collapse even sooner. These web services you mention should be expected in the future to adopt the use of technologies such as OpenTransactions, which will help their security and transparency. Them "just having bitcoins on a ledger" is an interim computer hack, not an ideal method.

certainly knows more about the ins and outs of the complexity of the modern fiat monetary systems, so I'll let him handle that aspect if he wants.
As for how Bitcoin reduces complexity, have you read Satoshi's whitepaper? It is nine pages long, easy to read, and covers everything perfectly. Now let that sink in. The protocol that has the potential to replace all of our complex banking systems can be reduced to that paper without losing much technical rigor. Bitcoin's simplicity is beautiful, although it can take some time to fully understand how all the pieces fit together.
The whitepaper:

I think you'd gain a lot from reading Daniel Krawisz's ["The Original Value of Bitcoins."](


Right, this makes goods like Bitcoin very peculiar compared to most economic goods, but not in any sense that would give reason to abandon the subjective theory of value. Quite the contrary, it very much bolsters the subjectivist position. It's no wonder that you seem to have a harder time fitting Bitcoin into your monetary worldview than a good praxeologist does.

On the other hand, I'm happy to hear my student group would interest unknown people on the Internet so much that they would even feel dissatisfied with a meeting. I've always hoped our discussions would not be relegated to oddly lit university classrooms.
If you think you or someone you know would be a great guest speaker on crypto-currencies at the Mises Circle, I would very much appreciate an email so I can make it happen: michael

Wow! PM sent.

I know that guy... Why didn't he invite me?

Heretic. Actually what happened:
Friedrich Hayek died and merged into the World Wide Web, the most spontaneous of orders, and in 2008, he sent his only begotten son, Satoshi Nakamoto, to rid the world of its monetary sins.

I will tweet the Google+ Hangout link on  when we are live. Google+ has a limit on participants so don't be disappointed if you have to stream on YouTube.

The inverted pyramid is an explicit attack on the power structures you are trying to assert Cody is a part of. It is also a nod to a great little bookstore here in Austin called [Brave New Books](

This will be a great article to refer the literati to, so we can save them from publishing trash like this:

With so much drama in the BTC  
It's kinda hard being S-a-to-the-toshi  
But somehow someway  
It keeps risin' in value nearly every single day  
May I kick a little somethin for the Gz  
And make a few ends as I breeze through  
a thousand on the gox and the party still jumpin  
Cuz the dollar ain't dead  
I got bitcoins on the paper off the connect  
And they ain't comin off til one thousand become ten  
So what you wanna do sheeeit  
I got a wallet full of coins and my homeboys do too  
So turn on the Tor and hit the Road  
Pirate's gone but drug trade only slowed  
So we gonna smoke a ounce to this  
Gox up, Fed down, while you motherfuckers mine the bits  
Loadin up the chain, runnin qt, watchin the coins flow in  
Laid back with my mind on my money and my money on my mind...wallet

Trying to tack on prestigious awards is hardly the way to show appreciation for Satoshi's creation. Better yet would be continuing to understand, develop, implement, and learn from the Bitcoin protocol. Bitcoin wasn't created so that a group of elites could shower it with praise. It was created to show that things can, should, and will be done differently in the Internet age, *regardless* of what a group of elites thinks.
Richard Feynman had important things to say about the Nobel Prize and honors in general in *The Pleasure of Finding Things Out*.

These two articles sum it up:  
  
Fellow Traveler has been extremely busy making awesome things happen with OT, and I, for one, am very excited.

You should check out Konrad Graf's article on the topic: 


Loaning bitcoins requires actually handing over bitcoins. You can't merely expand credit and increase the money supply. This is radically different from fiat money. And government backing is the only meaningful definition of fiat. All others are merely metaphorical and do not help in an analytic discussion.

The exploitation of this flaw is inevitable. Just look what they did to Charlton Heston.

This is wonderful news. I was able to inspire the very first Bitcoin transaction at the Mises Store back in July during Mises U.
Let's just hope they take my advice and use a merchant processor such as BitPay so that paying with Bitcoin is just as easy, secure, and fluid as it ought to be.
Do not give into evil but proceed ever more cryptographically against it.

That is completely misleading. 
You said:


Open-Transactions is completely open source: 
The Moneychanger client is as well: 
Say what you want about proprietary enterprise software, but don't conflate that with the software library itself. Anyone will be able to compete with Monetas's products by building on the open source library.

Daniel Krawisz did a great job of deconstructing the flaws with Mastercoin here: 
Fellow Traveler has deep knowledge of financial cryptography and has a comprehensive vision as to how to implement these functions. Open Transactions is very well engineered and does many of the functions Mastercoin is praised for: smart contracts, equities, decentralized anonymous corporations, etc. Instead of a flawed implementation on top of the block chain, OT can ultimately work directly with it as protocol development permits. This is not to say building on top of the block chain is bad, of course.
Mastercoin should be met with great skepticism (as all of these technologies should), and I think Open Transactions offers more robust, and sound, potential.

I agree. This is the sort of widget I'd love to see any merchant drag &amp; drop into their websites. The more community involvement in the creation of these tools, the better and easier it will be.
You guys rock for testing out Bitcoin and looking for the best ways to make the most out of it for consumers.

Of course he's from Austin, TX.
