Im new to bitcoin but this seems wierd to me, much like propaganda. I'm freaking out(sold low after buying bch), I'm going to fud out and buy more bch, I only invested a cowards amount of less then 50% my savings but I perfer when too many people say the same thing so I will now invest 50% and then 50% more, and will stop when people stop saying the same people stop saying the same people stop.

Don't hodl in coinbase. Put it into breadwallet. Not sure where litecoin can be put tho.

Then what COULD one buy with?

Bitcoin I don't feel like touching because I believe in it that much. I'm in it to the end. I don't like the idea of buying and selling and micromanaging it with all these fees. Mainly using coinbase so fees are high.
However, with my other cryptos that I believe in way less I am doing just this. Selling portions and will buy back later when it looks like it's back on an upswing.

This is all free. 
Download breadwallet app for iPhone or android. Send from coinbase to your breadwallet using the unique string you get. Test with like $1 first just to make sure you're doing it right.
You now own your own coins. Only bitcoin supported atm though.
And also, write down your backup codes somewhere safe and hidden. Breadwallet walks you through a lot of it.
Finally, make sure your phone isn't rooted or something like that. That just makes it vulnerable. Protect your phone with your fingerprint. Make your phone delete itself if someone tries to get in incorrectly more than ten times.

Also would like to know if breadwallet counts as s private wallet.

Simplified version is that a split in bitcoin is coming soon, Aug. 1st, and the price is expected to fluctuate more than usual. Watch for big drops and invest then. Alternatively, some would say perhaps now is the absolute best time to invest because perhaps the price will never be this low again? Either way, paper wallet or other type of private wallet should be where you hold your coins.
Exchanges are going to be freezing withdrawing/buying soon until the dust settles on/shortly after Aug. 1st.

Breadwallet. 
@_date: 2017-07-26 18:06:14
That I'm not sure of. I just used breadwallet to get my coins out of coinbase as quick as possible. 
@_date: 2017-07-23 14:02:05
Just 2 million dollars.

They sent a warning on the 19th to every registered user. I withdrew my coins from the vault, forgot to approve it for a few days, and still got my coins out instantly without any delay after that. They gave us plenty of warning. If you didn't expect there to be a delay as the 1st came near I don't know what to tell you. 
@_date: 2017-07-23 14:16:14
I am too honestly. Perhaps it isn't true?
