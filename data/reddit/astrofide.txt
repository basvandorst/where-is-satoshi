but how do you get the bitcoin you bought out of the exchange and into your wallet?
@_date: 2018-01-22 16:15:07
Yes, for many years now.
@_date: 2014-02-03 12:59:41
I don't believe you. It just seems too easy to print out a little bitcoin logo and tape it someplace, then "hey reddit look at what I bought with bitcoinz!". Like really, these pictures are everywhere. Someone should start getting funny with them.
@_date: 2014-02-17 00:39:31
Bravo. You're like the Batman of BTC.
@_date: 2014-01-13 18:13:49
It's pretty apparent.
A) The average person doesn't carry that kind of money in a wallet.
B)The average person doesn't want to put forth the effort in converting their dollars to magic internet money.
It may be difficult for you to see the serious message, bit it is there.
@_date: 2014-04-13 03:58:02
So you're certain bitcoin/crypto will never become the universal currency? Bold claim. I never asserted certainty. 
@_date: 2014-04-13 04:01:12
Good point. The whole internet thing is limiting. 
@_date: 2014-01-06 15:56:26
Never heard of it.
@_date: 2014-04-03 12:56:44
Teach *that* in school? And potentially cause students to become independent free thinkers that see the world objectively instead of how their parents told them it was? Preposterous. 
@_date: 2014-04-14 22:55:15
@_date: 2014-04-13 02:05:44
For clarity:
If all currency in the world was put together and converted to USD you would get $46,513,000,000,000. 
Divide that by the 21 million potential bitcoins in existance: 21,000,000
You get the potential max value of the bitcoin: $2,214,904.76
This would only happen if Bitcoin becomes the universal currency in a global economy. Long way to go.
@_date: 2014-04-26 20:49:53
This is exactly what will make Bitcoin worthwhile for the average consumer - global access to the network. 
This is also paving the way for [the outernet](
@_date: 2014-05-16 04:38:05
For one to gain others *must* lose, that's what makes investing in Bitcoin different from gambling. My theory is that the ones with the largest market influence (most Bitcoin) are winning, while all others are just sheep feeding the whales. It's kindof like capitalism. 
It's also why I stick to mining/holding.
@_date: 2014-12-24 18:08:06
You should probably move
@_date: 2014-04-02 17:08:09
Time to switch to BTC-e.
@_date: 2014-02-02 05:20:12
Your ISP can block/filter any content they please, and have extensive access to your usage data and personal information you use through their connection. How could it be any worse?
@_date: 2014-05-23 03:05:27
I can promise you there will be no "flood" of new Bitcoin enthusiasts because of a $100 rise. It will likely just fall back down tomorrow anyway.
@_date: 2014-03-27 19:50:34
Could be botnets that are mining in their own private pools.
@_date: 2014-02-21 13:33:47
You don't know how many of my friends have tried to get into bitcoin but couldn't muster up enough initiative to learn anything. I straight up told them if they can't figure out how to use a wallet they probably can't trade wisely either.  
One responded "I'm an Econ major bro I know what I'm doing".
Made me chuckle.
@_date: 2014-02-21 13:23:34


who was a notorious asshole and had it coming for him, I would not give a fuck actually. Poetic justice.
@_date: 2014-04-02 17:10:10
It's actually a pretty huge deal given that one of the largest crypto exchanges, BTC-e, is hosted and ran in Bulgaria.
@_date: 2014-04-14 22:50:25
Once there is a need for bitcoin, when it presents the consumer with more utility and a more convenient money solution, then you'll get both the chicken and the egg.
@_date: 2014-04-13 02:34:56
how is this crap? it's math. I'm not saying it will happen or should, I'm saying if it does happen this is what it will look like.
@_date: 2014-04-13 02:33:55
haha this was all in theory. quite obviously, no one knows what the fuck is going on with btc.
@_date: 2014-05-22 07:57:38
This is perfect.
@_date: 2014-04-11 18:29:14
And facebook's user account number grows daily but we don't call that a bright future for plainly obvious reasons.

$30 worth of M&amp;Ms
@_date: 2018-02-12 17:21:35
I've always liked the idea of moving the decimal over 3 places and just calling it a "bit". 
0.007 Bitcoin -&gt;  7 Bits  ~ $50
**1,000 Bits = 1 Bitcoin**
Just sounds easy and catchy.
@_date: 2019-01-09 23:27:40
is there a ruler of gravity?
@_date: 2019-01-06 21:02:42
Neither of those things.
Its not stability in the sense of monetary value because its value doesn't come from what people are willing to pay for it, unlike gold or stock.
Not security because that's relative.
Its a technology play, that not only happens to be faster, safer, and sometimes anonymous, but also has an enormous implication on the way every day transactions relate to the structure of society, ie. governments, banks, employers, work, life. The value comes from the sheer fact that the system itself will solve a problem or present so many more benefits that we want to use it. Its a need/use thing.
The value isnt something necessarily unique to bitcoin either - it just so happens to be the most widely adopted, improved and supported crypto blockchain tech, which likely won't change.
@_date: 2015-09-02 16:25:17
@_date: 2015-09-03 00:46:50
It's not about what's easy for the experts to do, its about what's easy to explain. Do someone who only has a brief understanding of Bitcoin, this is no explanation at all. If I were to have seen this a year ago, I would have immediately thought that this technology was so absurd and inconvenient that it's not even worth my time.
@_date: 2015-09-02 18:02:30
You can tell them that all you want, they still won't get it. I have a pretty good understanding of cryptography and the block chain and even this made me go "what the fuck is he talking about".
Imagine trying to use this example on a normie.
@_date: 2018-04-11 18:57:38


Try mailing cash for a transaction and let me know how that works


You just pointed out the single most problematic feature of cash and followed it up by saying it's good. Wat?
@_date: 2018-04-02 16:11:53
wtf do you mean "price slump".
BTC is still up seven-fold in a year and this is somehow a price slump?
@_date: 2018-04-10 17:21:38
I hope you realize people have been saying this for years, and yet 19k still happened....
@_date: 2015-10-25 07:23:06
Money is the problem. Bitcoin isn't a solution and it's already falling towards having the same shortcomings that money has. Money doesn't have intrinsic value - neither does bitcoin. What has value is what you do with the money. 
And anyone that tries to slam bitcoin for not being "backed by anything" needs to pull their heads out of the sand and realize that this country is 13 trillion dollars in debt because our dollar actually isn't backed by anything either, which is why it's much easier to just add a few zeroes to a computer banking credit system than it is to actually solve economic problems.
@_date: 2015-10-25 17:10:05
That is in fact a flaw.
Money shouldn't be able to be used as a means in and of itself to gain more money. You may call that an "opportunity", I call it pure damn evil. It's not hard to hire someone to set up a tradebot for you and watch your money turn into more money. It IS an absolute feature in all of the money systems we have seen thus far. A system created to ensure that power cannot be abused in such a way would be so much more successful as a medium of exchange that I wouldn't even want to call it money as the name itself would blemish such a system.
@_date: 2015-10-25 16:11:55
In the ideal sense, money is used only as a means of trade. You do a service/sell a product and get money, you use money to buy a service/product. 
Less ideally, money is used directly to gain more money (banking, wall street, bitcoin markets, etc).
As soon as that is allowed to happen you have a direct flow of money going to the ones who already have the most money and can therefore leverage the system to their advantage.

Your grammar bad now is.
@_date: 2015-10-11 15:49:43
get out, degenerate.
@_date: 2018-04-11 19:23:31


not cash.


good for you!
@_date: 2013-11-19 19:35:12
This answered the question best. I was unaware that for me to be able to purchase my own bitcoins through a market I would first have to buy out the sellers of lower price.
@_date: 2013-12-27 00:14:48
Right, but if those services are required for it to be used, it might as well be considered one in the same.
@_date: 2013-12-14 05:56:14
CEO of BTC China eh? Since when is there a CEO of bitcoin at all? I call shenanigans. This is bullshit. Come back when your only sources aren't youtube videos.
@_date: 2013-12-31 17:18:10
Not sure if sarcasm.
I sent back a miner and PSU and got a PSU in return.
@_date: 2013-12-27 01:47:14
I tend to think the same way, but we can only wait and see.
@_date: 2013-12-31 17:17:01
They don't have a number.
@_date: 2013-12-14 06:01:42
This probably didn't happen!
@_date: 2013-12-26 17:32:42
This is exactly the issue with BTC. It's just not convenient or trustworthy enough for the average consumer to use, therefore it cannot replace fiat as the primary medium of exchange over the internet.
@_date: 2013-12-07 16:14:43
Let the panic sellers sell, if they want to give their losses to the rest of us let them do so.
@_date: 2013-09-25 16:45:48
bitcoin is now officially impossible for the everyman. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 19:31:56
No one would need to want to buy it for $2,000, I could buy it from myself and only lose in transaction fees. I'm saying I believe it's too easy to do this, and if it is happening en masse, it means that the rise in the value of the bitcoin is purely bullshit.
