This pays more than most faucets.

I would be gladly willing, but that involves others trusting me. As we know there are some people who are willing to scam in the name of charity. So I could understand why people would be skeptical. I am trying to think of an indirect donation means that doesn't involve as must trust if they will not accept them directly.
