I grabbed the mbtc - thanks!
It seemed to work well, but I think it may be a bit confusing for users who aren't already familiar with the concept.  The fact that there's no real difference between the two sides of the transaction might seem strange.  Instead of "release", what about calling it "receive" on the recipient side and "refund" on the send side?
I was also a bit confused about the requirement for both sides to be viewing the page for the release request to appear.  Having to coordinate an exact time to both view the transaction page to get it done seems a bit cumbersome.
Good luck with the service, it fills an important void!

Regarding [end-to-end encryption]( be careful with client side javascript crypto.  If you're going to do it, you'll almost certainly want to deploy signed browser plugins to deliver it.  While "zero knowledge" of transactions on the server is certainly desirable, it's basically impossible to pull off securely.  If someone hacks your server, or even finds a simple XSS bug on one of your pages, they can easily (and silently) siphon off the data before it's encrypted.  This would give a false sense of security, which is arguably worse than no security at all.  See here for more - [Javascript Cryptography Considered Harmful](

Ah I didn't notice your security page earlier, just saw the mention of CryptoJS on the github issue.  You've certainly put a lot of thought into security at an early stage which is very refreshing to see!
