Are you really claiming the uncertainty of the name changetip (political change? pocket change?) has a better marketing posture simply because it has one less syllable? 
Bitcoin has made it's name known enough that a new user seeing bitcointip for the first time immediately thinks "Oh, this is that weird digital money thing I heard about. I have some now? Maybe I should look into this."
Seeing 'changetip' however, just makes a new user question what political/social campaign someone is trying to raise funds for and likely ignore the transaction. There's no immediate recognition. No generalized association. Your claim that changecoin has a better marketing posture is false. 
Opps, I mean changetip.

I think you're a little confused. 
Wanting to associate a service with it's underlying architecture, where little to no third party association exists, is quite unselfish. (bitcointip)
Wanting to associate a service with your third party, obscuring the underlying architecture, is actually selfish. (changetip)

There's another point I made elsewhere in the thread regarding the proposed name change. 














I really think new users (the audience bitcointip was intended to reach) will just broadly ignore the spamy sounding 'changetip' notices.

= "We haven't seen it done yet so it must be safe!"


= "My system's perfect! No-one involved in my super-complex Three-card Monte has accidentally or intentionally introduced a weakness!"


= "Suddenly math is not math!"

Yup, math you clearly have no grasp of.

And circular logic is a logical fallacy? 
Math can be used to track traffic patterns and analyze your behavior. You put 123.456BTC into a black-box containing 1000 BTC and got 123.256 out leaving 1000.2 in the black-box? 
Traffic analysis is already a popular mechanism for degrading the privacy of encrypted traffic. Obfuscating your holdings by playing and fancy game of Three-card Monte isn't a reliable privacy mechanism.

The weaknesses of Tor are exactly the point I've made. It's not magic.

The entirety of a good marketing posture cannot be boiled down to "a catchier name". There are tradeoffs. I'm suggesting that we continue to use the established brand (Bitcoin) via bitcointip and transparently improve the service with the code behind changecoin.
