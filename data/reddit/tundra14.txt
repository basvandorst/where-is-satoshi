I think it's unlikely, but possible. 
I was just covering my bases. 
@_date: 2018-01-09 18:54:14
Not all cryptocurrencies have outrages fees attached. 
@_date: 2018-01-04 10:09:23
Minus the one percent due to inflation... I mean, they need more money, and they have to get it from somewhere, right? Why not just print more!
@_date: 2018-01-09 19:04:08
I can send it virtually instantaneously across the web. 
@_date: 2018-01-09 19:19:18
And there are fees involved. That's why at some gas stations it's cheaper to pay with cash. 
I don't especially trust the state of our banking system. I mean, the financial state of the world is worrisome to say the least. 
@_date: 2018-01-09 22:36:53
Well you're welcome to stay on the sidelines if you wish.

People who buy bitcoin to try to day trade and get rich are going to get wrecked.   
Sure, you could get lucky and the price explodes overnight, it's happened, it's just not the most likely scenario. Hold for a year or 2, and yeah, it'll likely go up.
@_date: 2019-07-27 13:36:36
personally I'm for bitcoin going anywhere between 1 million and 10 million. It might be 25 to 50 years, but I should live that long. Unless bitcoin gets hacked, I don't really see it going under.   
Will there be a better one? I think there already are. It's just that bitcoin will always be worth something valuable to some people as it's the first.

I started in June, and I'm pretty happy with it. Did I expect 10k by the end of the year? No. Do I expect 20k by the end at this point? It's possibly, but really I expect people to be considering their bills for next month more than anything. 
This is probably a good buying opportunity... 
@_date: 2017-12-23 08:07:37
I saw no reason not to be able to afford to lose 1 coins worth of value for my share in the possible future. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 03:00:10
I mean, the answer would be to hold. 
But there's also that you're not suppose to invest money you can't consider lost/spent. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:46:48
those are pretty sturdy it would seem. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:26:30
Boo fucking who, give some bitcoin to some people you know don't have any. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 05:49:57
It's been a turbulent month. 
@_date: 2019-03-15 18:11:15
That's why you get a shift card, (or something similar) and then you can spend your money where visa is accepted. 
@_date: 2017-08-07 11:33:37
Oh please, bitcoins not anywhere near that stage yet. It's power-level isn't over 9000 and that happened before he went all super. 
@_date: 2017-08-07 11:29:08
I've been explaining it this way to people. 
@_date: 2017-08-07 21:15:34
Thor wasn't the first to say it either. But thanks to the sophisticated technology of the day, millions have heard him say it, even though he's a fictional movie character. He's not a good source though, as he is fiction, magic does exist in the imagination. Sort of. 
@_date: 2017-08-09 19:01:22
I'm Hodling. 
@_date: 2019-08-19 05:19:40
Seems to be fluctuating right now. Which is good.
@_date: 2017-08-07 11:32:12
I've heard magic is really just a fancy word for indistinguishable sophisticated technology.
@_date: 2019-10-31 00:24:12
On Comming from Musk.   
I smell change comming.   
No really, our current banking system has already been proven bunk.   
Bitcoin isn't perfect. It's designed to include updates.
@_date: 2019-06-27 19:33:23
You know part of it's going to be some of the people who've been around for a while that just stopped buying because of just how much it's gained. There aren't enough newbies to keep driving the price up, so it's collapsing.
@_date: 2019-06-27 19:21:48
It's down several percent today, but I bought in at 2300 back in June the year it hit 20,000 by December.   
This doesn't even begin to scare me.   
Now if I hear news somebodies wallet was hacked ... (not an exchange) Then I'll be concerned.
@_date: 2019-06-28 03:31:47
Chin up, It's not about tomorrow. No investment should be bought today and sold tomorrow.
@_date: 2019-06-27 20:20:51
and not the worst bitcoin has seen.   
At the start of the year it was at 3.2k and now it's at 10k.   
If somebody seriously expects it to only go up, they're only fooling themselves.
@_date: 2019-06-27 19:11:07
This is why you don't buy when it's been all green for a while.   
If it continues red for a few days, I wouldn't be surprised.   
If it continues green again, that's more surprising, but again, not TOO surprising.
@_date: 2019-06-27 20:25:44
So what you do is hodl and wait. Ideally bitcoins price wouldn't move much at all. It's volatile.  I knew this before I bought in at 2300, which was sort of a high at the time. Before I bought in I did some research, and this was explained to me by virtually every source I came across.   
The number one tip to investing, don't spend more than you're willing to lose.   
If I lose what I have invested today, yeah, it'll hurt, but I'll survive.
@_date: 2019-06-27 19:35:19
I'm not going to be made if it's a bear market for a little while longer
@_date: 2019-06-27 19:22:37
I'm not sure it's dipped low enough to  buy yet... But in theory even if you bought at the high this week, you're still going to profit.
@_date: 2019-06-04 16:59:30
It gained over 100% in a couple of months. A 10% pullback isn't much.
@_date: 2019-06-27 19:30:15
I think xaxiomatic just means the price swing. 13 to 10 is only 3k. The price of an extremely nice computer.
100k to 80k is 20k is still not a Tesla.
@_date: 2019-06-28 03:33:37
I bought at 13k, last time it was at 13k.   
I'm still hodling. (I started at 2.3 ... it went up up and up. I last bought when it dipped to 13)   
P.s. I'm fine with things as they are atm
@_date: 2019-02-20 05:03:53
Fomo Fud
@_date: 2019-06-27 20:27:36
That's true, but today is the first day of the dip. It might go up briefly tomorrow, it might not. But it also stayed at \~3500 for a few months or more, and so, I did buy more :)
@_date: 2019-12-07 04:57:32
Too bad I'm like her.
@_date: 2019-04-27 18:08:46
which is a protocol
@_date: 2018-11-24 21:57:28
with my luck, I'd sell, it bottoms out, and begins climbing again. 
@_date: 2018-02-23 21:06:54
depends on how rich I was, and what the actual purpose is. 
I'm not super rich, but I can afford to help a few other people. 
@_date: 2018-02-24 06:08:17
You asked first, and If I'm to give to multiple, people. 
I'd give to you... second. 
maybe you deserve 13.50 as apposed to 12.50 (Pm(not Am) ) 
I'd give you around about that much. 
I'm a thousand air
look at me flaunt my money about. 
I"m a godamn poor person. 
But I have .1 of a bitcoin. 
.000125 isn't hard to give. 
Neither is , .00125
@_date: 2018-02-24 06:06:37
I read this message earlier, and if I were less drunk now, I'd consider it. 
12.50 isn't much, but I also can't just copy that address. (I (I guess) made a typo)
@_date: 2018-02-24 06:09:16
Math adds up though, I can't give that to 'everyone' (middle ground) 
Some people just are worth more than others, to some people. 
To me. 
you're all at least worth, 1 satoshi. 
@_date: 2019-09-23 14:43:35
I wouldn't care about crypto if it didn't seem like a better currency
@_date: 2019-09-25 14:25:24
They don't say buy the bottom of the dip, and when it does jump in price suddenly, you should sell. 
Personally I'm just collecting a little at a time, and in 10 to 20 years if it's still doing well, I'll retire.
@_date: 2019-09-25 14:31:52
When I first bought, it was 2300 a coin. 6 months later it briefly hit 20,000.
@_date: 2019-09-25 14:30:28
You have to pay taxes on all currency when you trade it for more than what you got it for initially, supposedly. 
Anytime you trade something for more money, the profit is supposed to be taxed some amount.
@_date: 2019-05-27 08:24:16
I've used it, and personally I think it works fine. The thing is, it's not a hardware wallet. So if you keep large sums of money on it, it's at risk.
@_date: 2019-05-19 02:30:02
I own .1 of that. If it does move, It's because I have a hardware wallet
@_date: 2019-05-27 03:32:40
I was going to say something along the same lines... Not surprised somebody else did it first.
