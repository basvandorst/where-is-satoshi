You have 8 digit phone numbers in Australia? That's almost as bad as the spiders...

That's hilarious. The 2008 crisis happened because of too little regulation, not too much. There's a reason Canada weathered the recession far better than the US did, it's because Canada has far stronger banking regulations.

Alright I'll give that a shot, if not I'll try the brute forcing

I'm not sure, a friend ran it for me. I think he just found it online.

Bitcoin-qt. The backup is from February 2013, not sure what version I was on back then but it might be the really old one. I may have sent coins once since then, but never since the encryption. 
@_date: 2015-07-17 21:18:13
I know it tells me that, but from what I read that's caused by making new transactions under the encrypted wallet, which I haven't done. 
@_date: 2015-07-17 21:07:36
How old would I be looking for?

Never touched command line, I don't want to accidentally mess up the backup too. Would it be safer to install it on a sperate PC then load the backup wallet?
@_date: 2015-07-20 18:55:31
Backup worked fine. Made a fresh wallet, sent all the coins over, nuked the old ones, made sure to write the new password in more than one place.

It is very difficult to withdraw cash on MtGox, but it is the best market for day trading. That's why Gox's volume and price is so high comparted to other exchanges.

Just to confirm this is only if you logged out and back in during that time period, not if you were simply logged in, right?

By that logic no store should have store ever have a sale. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 15:40:36
That's bullshit. Even in 2011 we thought $1000 a coin was possible,  if not unlikely. $600,000 a coin is ridiculous, even $10,000 is a reach. 
@_date: 2013-11-28 21:39:39
Gox's rate should really be ignored, since it is so difficult to get your money from them. Coinbase has a comparable rate, so does Bitstamp.
My unscolicited advice would be to turn that Gox USD into Bitcoins and hold them for a while, unless you need that $300 now.

• What made Bitcoin look promising enough for you to buy in / mine?
Honestly, I was a teenager with a shitty job excited by the idea of free money. My interest in bitcoin as a concept didn't come till I was already mining. 
• How was your financial situation beforehand? What was your reaction to the recent price jumps?
Like I said, I was a broke teenager. Now as a slightly less broke university student, I'm not really phased by them. In theory I have enough BTC to pay my tuition for my whole degree (I'm Canadian, so that's not as much as you might think), but for now I'm holding. 
• What does the future of Bitcoin hold for you? Do you plan to stay invested or sell when you feel the price is right? 
When I need the money I'll probably sell half of mine. I almost sold 3 for 3k flat on Virtex but I backed out at the last minute. 
• If more local stores were to accept Bitcoin, which currency do you think you'd use more, Cash or Bitcoin? 
Until bitcoin stabilizes I prefer to use cash, eventually I'd like to be able to use bitcoin for everything though. 
• In your opinion, will Bitcoin ever reach the point of being a widespread currency used in most countries?
Depends, the price needs to stabilize first. 
• For the most part, it would seem the majority of the Bitcoin community is friendly and generous, why do you think that is?
 Bitcoin's success depends on it having a positive image, plus a lot of people are genuinely excited about bitcoin and want to share that  excitement with others. 
• When you first heard about Bitcoin, did you honestly believe anything would come of it? 
March of 2011 was the first time I looked into it. I couldn't figure out how to mine though, so I dismissed it. I didn't start mining until May of that year. I mined a few with my GTX 460, then the hype started to build and in June I picked up two 5830s for $100 each. Overall I mined just under 20 coins, all of which I have today (most on a truecrypted thumb drive). 
Any answers are appreciated guys, thanks and happy holidays!

Understandable, I'm contemplating cashing out some of mine to pay for tuition, if Bitcoin continues to rise at a rate over 5% a year I'm better off taking student loans though.

Thanks for posting this! I just got an Android phone (Nexus 5), and I was about to transfer a small sum of BTC to it. Now I'll definitely think twice about sending any sum that I would be bothered by losing.

Thanks, I can't believe we still let trash posts like this on @_date: 2013-12-01 20:03:30
I remember when we thought 300,000 was insane and unprofitable. 
@_date: 2013-11-28 21:24:32
That would make sense, if people are using Gox's larger volume for speculation, then cashing out on more reliable exchanges. But still, 20% is a huge gap.

I've never really regretted my decisions involving Bitcoin, but I seriously regret dismissing Namecoin when I first heard about it.

Conspiracies aside, he was certainly robbed of Maine and the media attention that would've come with a win.

On a side note, I also think we need to do something about the length of time it takes to confirm a transaction. Over an hour is a long time to wait. 
@_date: 2013-11-28 21:12:06
I'm glad it wasn't a problem with the wallet itself, it just reminded me I should be as cautious with an Android wallet as I am with my wallet on Windows.

It's great news in the sense that it's an official affirmation from the government that that Bitcoin use by citizens is legal.

CAVirtex will let you withdraw 3k a month with no verification, they do a direct deposit into your bank account at any major Canadian bank (I use TD). The fee is only $6, but their trading fee is 1.5% which is high. Processing time is about a week, the prices are about  20% lower though.
