This is a really stupid thing to do. Especially now that bitcoin has proven itself not to be ready to be used as a currency (yet). Brb losing 60% of my hard earned wage just because some rich people want to cash out their btc.

Assuming you are living the low-middle class life with that amount of bitcoin, not cashing out anything feels foolish. At least sell maybe 20 btc and recieve some of that hard earned hodling power to upgrade your life and feel less stressed by market fluctiations.

What correction
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:33:09
Thats what everybody has been saying ever since btc hit 100usd. Also there are plenty of other cryptocurrencies who have a higher chance of doing a 1000% gain from here other than bitcoin. Dont focus too much on the one thats getting the most hype.
@_date: 2017-12-01 19:00:43
Thats just retarded. Then just buy the game with cash and save yourself the fees and trouble for using btc transactions.
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:43:28
I suggest doing some research and then you'll realize its less of a gamble and more of an investment into a future where cryptocurrencies will be inevitably used for almost everything. and im not talking about bitcoin persé, there are hundreds of viable candidates.

Nobody is buying any btc with futures
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:20:42
Yes we are watching history, no we are not trading at 19k (yet) with the exception of a few buggy trades before gdax/coinbase crashed

If you are forced to spend btc on an item because you dont have any cash you should rethink your strategy because thats just stupid. 
You can justify it however you like, spending your asset that will increase in value to buy cash or items will lose you money. And thats not even including the network fees.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:07:32
No, you are just watching a buggy overloaded exchange
@_date: 2017-12-01 18:57:50
Buying things with btc is literally cashing out with an extra step. sure your game you bought with 0.0001 btc may be worth 10usd now but by next year you would have spent 1000usd because btc grew 100x and you didnt want to buy with cash. And then im the one getting downvoted ...
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:05:30
"price is too high, i wont buy, i need it lower so i can get some gains" 
-price drops
"i was right not to buy, its going down" 
I mean now is the perfect time to buy if you use your own logic, dont give in to the fear.

Just because physical money is stored in a digital system doesn't mean they are cryptocurrencies, it just means they put all the aspects of the current monetary policy online with all the negatives that go along with it such as inflation. It is not backed up by any code like cryptos
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:50:52
How about "wall street" selling a billion usd worth of bitcoin versus the 0.1btc the average joe owns. Combine that with negative press and media and futures, OFCOURSE they can crash the market.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:39:18
This is not about foreign currencies, its about 1 exchange trading at 19k usd while the others are still at 15k, You really dont see anything wrong with reporting the price on that 1 exchange and ignoring the rest , especially since its in the middle of a crash caused by overload?
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:01:34
It did not hit those numbers yet, only cause by an overloaded exchange
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:38:32
This is only coinbase, this is not the global price
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:30:23
No it didnt, theres some weird stuff going on in coinbase that is not representative for global btc price
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:44:53
Its not, stop with these fake price threads, coinbase seems to be up to weird shenanigans, real price still around 16k
@_date: 2017-12-03 12:59:21
This seems like the most probably scenario. These big investors arent dumb and if they can make a self fulfilling prophecy come true when futures launch by crashing bitcoin themselves, it would make them very happy.

!remindme 20 days
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:53:14
You are right, i would also pick coins with better potential such as ethereum or iota. good call
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:30:33
Getting all your statistics from 1 exchange doesn't work either, its the global price/picture that counts.
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:28:17
I think the biggest point you are missing is the mathematical code behind every crypto and its transaction which is uncorruptable and irrefutable. The same cannot be said for usd stored digitally, sure as long as the government controlling it stays loyal to its users it should be fine, but why take that risk? 
@_date: 2017-11-11 10:15:50
200sat/bit here, just surpassed 24hours with not a single confirmation .. this is getting retarded 
@_date: 2017-11-11 08:30:09
i put a 4$ fee yesterday, its still pending ... this is retarded
@_date: 2017-11-21 05:59:26
What dip
@_date: 2017-11-12 17:25:22
Ye, im sure they are kicking themselves in the head for going from 300usd to 1500 post correction.
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:20:15
pick one wtf ... Buying games is the same as cashing out, but if you like to pay 10 000usd per steam game, thats yours bsns.
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:16:15
Or worst case it goes down 20% every year from here on until its at 1k again ... exponential market graphs are nothing to celebrate in the long term, no market has ever sustained such growth. I would like for bitcoin to prove me wrong but its highly unlikely.
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:29:42
Assuming the growth % will be the same next year. And looking at the parabolic btc graph it would be retarded to think any market could keep this up ...
@_date: 2017-11-02 06:02:32
you mean 7k
@_date: 2017-11-29 07:55:55
well duh, the question is if it can sustain this growth rate. 
@_date: 2017-10-30 11:38:26
Trade all my btc for neo ? Ok got it !
@_date: 2017-10-27 15:35:20
hence the usage of the word "could"
@_date: 2017-10-17 05:36:04
Just be mindful that you bought in at an all time high. Expect a correction in the near future. Its all nice and fun when markets explode but holding through the dip is the hard part.
@_date: 2017-10-27 14:54:26
The head and shoulder pattern theoretically signals a trend reversal. In this example it could indicate a drop in price for the next days.
@_date: 2017-10-21 18:54:38
looks like he pulled down the wall as soon as it was about to hit it ;) just some good old price manipulation by whales. Probably nothing extraordinary but was still cool to see.
