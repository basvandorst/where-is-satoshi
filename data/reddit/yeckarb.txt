Don't answer  it's too blatantly obvious. Anyone with half a brain should realize the massive fraud Mt Gox commits

Shh, dumbass, that's the idea in not buying right now. Load up after the second deadly crash and watch it rise a third and even greater time!

Did you have to scan a proof of residence to use Dwolla?

LOL. Prepare for regret.

Except it'll never again be lower than $0.01 ;)
In it till the end!

THIS THIS THIS. MTGOX is run by a group of people who have WAY too much control over the price. They purposefully lag the servers to buy bitcoins for themselves.
The bitcoin exchanges are the real failing point of bitcoin. Where you finally have to TRUST somebody...

right, because that applies and is relevant in this market...

Nah dude, seriously, bitcoin is, in and of itself, something more than just 'what the Silk Road uses.' It's an idea, and a conversion rate to USD.

I think bitcoin is past confidence, bud. People are just playing it like a penny stock. Any reasonable predictions are over, other than UP UP UP

Yes, it is, and it should have been implemented from the beginning.
No joke, guys. I know I'm a bit of a conspiracy nut, but after all this DDoS bullshit, this should come second hand. The fact that Mt. Gox HASN'T done this makes me think they might be the ones DDoSing themselves.

LOL. Bad? This is GREAT for the coin. The earlier the better. I said the same thing you did 5 months ago
