Are you saying that we're at the moon already?

No, they totally allow for that to happen, but you'd have to reverse everything that happens in the universe.
Everything that happens in one direction can happen in the opposite direction, it's just less probable.
A time machine in the traditional sense wouldn't work though.
@_date: 2019-07-11 19:56:53
I think you're missing my point. Your CC number, or bank account number IS your private key for your account. If someone has that number they can do whatever they want to your account, and they NEED that number to be able to process a transaction.
In bitcoin, NO ONE needs your private key to process a transaction. You can do so without ever exposing anything that makes you vulnerable to attack.
With banks and credit cards, **every transaction** is opening up yourself for attack, is essentially exposing your private key.

You're a fucking nutcase. That's the stupidest thing you could have done with your money.
I have no doubt you'll succeed. I've been thinking of filing the same.

Yeah, it's crazy how out of date our financial system is.

Ehh, sometimes it's hard not to jump to conclusions, I guess.

I really don't get the beef. I sub to both, and both seem fine.
Edit: Hmm, seems like I don't sub to anymore. I don't remember unsubbing, and looking at it now, yeah, I would agree with the scam sentiment. Hahaha.
Edit 2: when did become about BCH instead of BTC? WTF? That's dumb.
@_date: 2019-07-11 19:51:54
None of them were ever Spotify subscribers, and they were being charged $119 4-5 times in succession. It was straight fraud through compromised account numbers.
With bitcoin, you never need to expose your "account number" AKA private key like you do in the banking world.
@_date: 2019-07-11 19:46:19
It's interesting to read the article and realize how well bitcoin fixes this.
No one, without your private key, could withdraw money out of your account, and paying money doesn't expose your private key, unlike in the rest of the world, where your account number IS your private key.
@_date: 2019-07-12 16:11:33
It probably isn't even Spotify billing their accounts.
It's super easy to put whatever you want as the name for a charge like that.
I could charge your account and make it show up as "Spotify"

Someone has decided to play with the dosage of their medication today, I see.
@_date: 2019-07-07 21:46:35
Ehh, I can't be bothered to get too bent out of shape about any of that.
I get what you're saying though, I remember when all of that was going down.
@_date: 2019-07-11 20:52:03
Yeah, it'll be an interesting thing to watch for sure.
@_date: 2019-07-11 20:19:44
According to the article, it's more likely fraud. It has nothing to do with Spotify fucking up. It might not even be Spotify doing the charges. None of these people ever even used Spotify. Someone can put whatever they want in that text box when they withdraw money out of an account.
Because, fundamentally, the way we handle banking, account numbers and credit card numbers is flawed.
If you have someones account number/CC number and name, you can charge their account whatever you want.
With Bitcoin that isn't possible at all. It's a push instead of pull.
The old banking method, as one of my friends said, is like giving someone your full wallet and telling them "just take how much I owe you out of that and leave it here when you're done."
Where as bitcoin is more like "Here is the money I owe you that I took out of my wallet from a hidden place that you have no possible way of finding ever"
@_date: 2019-07-07 19:11:47
Come on, I just got platinum for my post, do you think I'm going to believe anything you say after that?
JK. But yeah, I vaguely recall that. IIRC, the final straw was the fact that they always had drama going on there (legitimate or not, they were always bitching, and seems still are). I think I even made a comment to that effect and how it's not what anyone is there for, and how it only hurts their own community. I got shit on hard, and was like, "welp you don't need me to sink this ship, peace".
@_date: 2019-07-07 07:38:11
Yeah, someone replied and it reminded me why I unsubbed, I was subbed to both for bitcoin news and to hear peoples thoughts on btc.
I remember the beef but wanted to hear both sides, but eventually their side was nothing other than personal attacks and just garbage, so I unsubbed.
@_date: 2014-05-10 02:35:10
Wow, bitcoin must be really struggling, they could't afford to properly and fully clothe that poor girl. She is missing a whole shoulder strap, and the rest of it looks like it was 3 sizes too small...

I don't think he fully appreciates how much power governments have.
While I think the odds of several governments working together to do such a thing are laughably small, I don't think it's impossible, and that sort of thing has happened historically MANY MANY times, so it's definitely not impossible, and naive to think it can't happen again.

This is the most worrying part about bitcoin I've ever heard.
What is our governance structure like?
@_date: 2019-08-14 23:07:08
Yeah, gold historically always recovers, and is doing so right now from it's all time high, Bitcoin doesn't have anywhere near the history to guarantee that, like how gold can.
Don't get me wrong, I love Bitcoin, but it's a bit of the pot calling the kettle black.

Who has control of the github repo? What if the owners of the repo decides to shut people out and take bitcoin in a fucked up direction? We fork? Again?
How many forks can we take before it's death by 1000 papercuts?

It's up 200% for the year but down 50% overall.

IDK. if it were run more like a Co-Op I think I'd feel better about it. Something like each bitcoin is also a voting share.
But who knows if that would work either.

Huh, that is a great point that I hadn't considered.
Thanks for actually engaging and providing real info, without throwing insults. I appreciate it.

I mean a hard fork from the blockchain perspective.
It's easy to call them janitors, but when they are the only ones who hold the keys to the castle, that kinda changes things quickly.
I think we need to address this issue as a community somehow.

The price volatility isn't crypto's biggest problem...
It's the fact that it doesn't pass the grandmother test.
It's still too complicated to use, and the average octogenarian can't figure it out.
Hell, when I went to pay for something via bitcoin, I had a hell of a time figuring out if I had a segwit wallet or not, and how to pay. I incorrectly assumed it was as easy as scanning a QR code or entering an address and a value, but nope.
It took me 2 hours to figure it out, granted because I was being super cautious and double checking everything, but with Bitcoin, there are no transaction reversals, so if I fuck up, it's game over.
But that's a whole other problem, the average person isn't going to appreciate how careful you have to be, they are going to assume that the systems in place are going to protect them from small mistakes. They won't, and if they get bitten even once, they will likely lose confidence in the technology entirely.
This is Bitcoins achilles heel that no one talks about.
Before you say "but exchanges do...", no, the whole point of bitcoin is that it's decentralized, and you can manage it and hold it yourself. Exchanges put the user right back where they were with banks.
@_date: 2019-08-21 14:27:24
I wrote the comment then clicked through the link.
It doesn't really address my concern that if the github maintainers decide to try to do something fucked up, that we have any recourse but a fork again.
Also, how do we choose the maintainers? It's not democratic it seems.

The person isn't doing the process right then.
I know a designer who had another designer of the same name take her twitter handle by filling a claim that she was an imposter.
It went through successfully.
@_date: 2019-08-21 01:43:21
Well, bitcoin.org is presumably run by the same individuals that maintain bitcoin core's code base, is it not?
I'd say they have the best justification for ownership of the bitcoin twitter handle.
@_date: 2019-08-21 14:44:58
If the maintainers go in one direction and other people go in another, that's a hard fork.
@_date: 2019-10-09 23:10:49
So close.
@_date: 2019-10-09 23:09:00
I mean... This hardly counts...
@_date: 2019-08-20 23:31:41
Why doesn't bitcoin.org just contest the twitter account, take it over, and get it verified?
@_date: 2019-10-15 15:37:25
I did that when it peaked at 800 dollars, then slumped to 200 for like 3 years.
Kept on holding though.
@_date: 2019-12-03 17:33:47
That doesn't really make sense for a multitude of reasons.
@_date: 2019-12-03 17:56:39
Explain how you couldn't obfuscate where the bitcoins came from by passing it all through thousands of tiny transactions in thousands of wallets over the course of several years?
Part of the core points of Bitcoin is no central control authority, so how could you centrally void someones's currency?
@_date: 2019-12-03 19:10:04
Sure, but if there is a long enough trail it's gonna be hard to track, plus...
Doing that is a huge problem, because someone could innocently receive "tainted" bitcoin and then the won't be able to spend it.
This is contrary to the whole point of bitcoin, where there is no central control of the currency, if we start doing crap like that, what's to stop a government from saying "No one can accept money from person y because they broke the law by being a woman, gay, believing in vaccines, etc."?
This is hugely problematic, and goes against everything bitcoin stands for.
@_date: 2019-12-03 19:46:09
Despite your desire to paint it this way, this isn't "my vision", this is what Bitcoin is billed as.
A currency that is free of any sort of limitations by governments, wrongdoers, or powers that be, controlled entirely by your private key, for better or for worse, because all other existing currencies are manipulated to leverage control over people and take way their financial independence whenever it suits the people in power.
I think most of this sub would agree with me on this too.
Now, I don't know if what you're saying is factual, but either way, it's HIGHLY problematic, because it makes bitcoin no different from any other currency, which at that point, why fucking bother?
This is a rhetorical statement, don't respond.

America is also one of the 3 top counties with the most debt.
America also has a higher percentage of people living below the poverty line, 14.5% vs. Russia's 11%. (
 )
So, if you look at the individual people, they are better off in Russia, wealth wise. There are MANY other problems in Russia though as we're all well aware, but that's not the point.
The point is, a free market economies are very good at making a small group very wealthy and everyone else very poor.

That depends on how you define "better".
If you take "better" to mean having more, then yes.
If you take "better" to mean happier, then in the US no. Not statistically anyway.
@_date: 2017-04-30 01:53:08
Because free market economys have worked sooo well in the past. :/
@_date: 2019-04-07 13:54:17
Yeah, like WTF?
If bitcoin catches on, it will be worth the energy it uses, which is kinda the point.
@_date: 2017-04-30 15:16:28
Free doesn't exist. The whole concept is misguided.
There is always a cost, and in free market economies, the cost is that some people get rich, and they are able to create a feedback loop to make themselves richer, and everyone else becomes poor.
Then as the rich get richer, it dilutes the value of everyone, making the poor even poorer.
This is really rather simple, and very long studied. It's like anything else in the natural world.
