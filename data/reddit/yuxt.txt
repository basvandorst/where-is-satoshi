it's not a big market, but I assume majority of people who trade bitcoins also play on the stock market.

Organic Crepes for bitcoins in Brooklyn DUMBO.     [ Though I found it tricky to actually accept them when not online. One of the way is to use BitWillet. Since we have WiFi people with laptops can buy crepes buy visiting this page:  [o-crepes.com/bitcoin](  once we confirm the transaction we can server the order. Another way is by using QR code reader to get the address.

Can anyone create a graph depicting price of Bitcoin vs Stock Market?

You probably want to post some information about yourself. Due to all the recent events people are very concerned who they trust their bitcoins. Fast look at whois records indicates that there is no real person behind this site. It's a great cause, but how can you guarantee my donations will reach the recipients?
