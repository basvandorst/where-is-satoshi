I have no idea really, I never used any of those exchanges.  Maybe others have more insight.  But I think naked short selling may have something to do with it, which is different than regular shorting.  So if you have Bitcoins on one of those exchanges, then possibly those Bitcoins don't really exist and the exchanges are using fractional reserve practices, which pushes down the price.  This is probably more likely in places like China and other sketchy countries.  Bottom line if you don't hold your own private keys, you don't really own Bitcoin.

I think big banks and other entrenched interests are [shorting]( Bitcoin to kill it.  They know Bitcoin is a threat and have huge amount of capital that they can use to attack Bitcoin.  It seems kind of like a criminal scam.  Its easy to put tons of shorts, and then dump some bitcoin on the market to profit on it.

Hi fucknozzle.  You seem to be the one who misunderstands.  Its like if someone is prepared to dump 10,000 bitcoins.  But they decide to open some large short positions beforehand.  Therefore when they do dump, they also profit on their shorts.  Its called market manipulation and even the CFTC has recently spoken their concerns on the matter: 


Also if you think banks and the status-quo are not threatened by Bitcoin or even interested in it, well [you're wrong]( about that as well.  
Also learn the difference between regular shorting, and naked shorting.
