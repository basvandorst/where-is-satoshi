Believe what you want to believe but a normal person like me and many others wouldn't find it easy to deal with that much money if it is indeed proven that it is stolen. Many would simply return it to avoid problems (or at least don't ever touch it).
But again, do you have any evidence at this point that those funds are stolen? I have seen none so far.

I posted an address just because this may be historic and exciting. I would probably either give them back to its rightful owner (if it is proven without a doubt who is the owner, for now it seems they are not bfx coins) or else not touch them for years, maybe never. Every coin out of circulation benefits every other bitcoin holder as supply is crunched more and more. I wouldn't really like to mess with truly tainted coins, for moral and legal reasons.

If that is our hope to decentralize development in case it is necessary, we are in for a painful journey.
@_date: 2018-01-04 19:41:15
That is the most ridiculous thing ever.
If Bitcoin really suddenly lost it's leading status after years of consolidation it would be a fatal blow to the "digital gold"/"store of value" idea that has catapulted crypto to it's current heights.
Coins would be then rightfully considered as a mere casino chips.

They wouldn't owe us anything if they didn't have a "monopoly" on the development of "our" $250B network.
They have the privilege to be at the center of this world changing technology and they should act accordingly.

@_date: 2018-01-05 02:47:36
Maybe because 99% of alts are trash that don't actually have a reason to exist?
Try finding the needle in the haystack...
@_date: 2018-01-06 00:16:46


Agree about this completely. I just ended up searching for providers accepting BCH (ugh...) for services that I previously paid in BTC.
However... this is mostly an engineering problem for which there are solutions approaching fast.
Once this engineering problem is solved (or greatly improved) there will not be much reason for the existence of 10 more alts (let alone 1,300...)
I don't discard the possibility that Bitcoin won't cover 100% of use cases, so maybe there will be some surviving alts, but certainly the existence of dozens, hundreds or thousands of mostly useless alts is against everybody's long term interest. As it is now, it is basically an international casino game, instead of a history-changing technology as it could and should be.
@_date: 2018-01-04 18:51:56
Have you not been following the news?
You can transact with LN right now.
I think you're used to instant software improvements like when centralized companies (FB, TT, etc.) release a "new feature" for everyone, but this is not like that. Remember all the innovation here is about decentralization, if you want instant new features go to Paypal (or even some supposedly decentralized alts)
@_date: 2018-01-29 03:01:07
This is the most important question actually.
We're identifying new attack vectors on a daily basis.
@_date: 2018-01-08 06:21:36
All I'm saying is the network is barely usable now. It's pushing hardcore bitcoin maximalists (like myself) to other networks to complete basic value transfers. I'm not even remotely talking about paying for a coffee, I'm now talking about moving $100 or more.
No amount of conspiracy theories will fix that (even if some of those theories are true).
We need a solution, at least a temporary one, and we need it very soon.
We shouldn't be willing to test the true nature of bitcoin success so far... I suppose almost nobody into bitcoin for the past few years want to see it being surpassed easily by competitors for not being able to hear its users timely enough.
I'm not even talking about market cap (that is currently a shitty, shitty metric). I'm talking about being surpassed as a usable network.

@_date: 2018-01-07 20:11:39
Does Bitcoin Cash have Segwit?
Does Bitcoin Cash have the network effect of Bitcoin?
Does Bitcoin Cash have a clear dev roadmap apart from changing a variable in the Core code?
Does Bitcoin Cash even have a healthy, extensive community of open source devs involved?
If so, I'm all in...
@_date: 2018-01-08 06:14:50
Well, if you think I've been misguided by propaganda, I'd be happy to know the truth, please enlighten me.
@_date: 2018-01-30 23:11:10
I care and actually I'm very happy about Facebook decision. It was one of the main ways the crypto ecosystem got contaminated and new users scammed away from it.
@_date: 2018-01-12 19:20:17
Exactly, let the ACTIONS talk. This is no time for words anymore.
@_date: 2018-01-09 20:18:13
Look, I am as pro core as someone can be. And I've been understanding and testing Lightning and think it is brilliant and has the potential to sweep the alts once fully implemented on mainnet.
However, there are two things you can't deny:
1.- Many, many users who are not really into technology (not everyone must be into it) are VERY ANGRY because of extremely high fees.
2.- There is an immediate solution that would relieve the problem temporarily (increasing block size) while we have the other sophisticated solutions implemented, and there are devs that are willing to make the change but the Core guys in control of the repo won't allow it.
That means there is a monopoly over the development which was and is my point. I don't se how you can deny that (I'm not even implying it is necessarily a bad thing).
@_date: 2018-01-07 19:12:45
"Transactions" should only include elements of one kind to be accurate (like transferring value from A to B).
@_date: 2018-01-13 20:55:26
Well... If they spend much more than 2 - 3 weeks for testing batching...
I think we can expect their segwit implementation in 2020...
@_date: 2018-01-07 18:55:52
Even as a faithful believer in Bitcoin Segwit + Lightning improvements and hardcore Core devs supporter I tend to agree we are in need of urgent actions to relieve the high fees problem.
While Bitcoin technology can be the most solid when talking about decentralization, it will risk losing another equally important feature that currently makes it the dominant force in the crypto market: network effect.
I, myself, have been FORCED in the last few days to pay for online services that I've always paid in BTC in different crypto currencies because of the utter impossibility to make them in bitcoin.
Some say the Core devs don't owe us anything, but I tend to disagree, they are voluntarily holding the "keys to the kingdom" of a value network that holds over $250B in users' funds (our funds).
They owe us a proper roadmap for the improvements we need or else they should pass the responsibility to equally capable people that can provide us that roadmap. The certainty of the value we hold on the network is at stake.
@_date: 2018-01-30 04:09:31

Thank you for the information, time traveler.
@_date: 2018-01-04 19:11:56
And the network effect...
EDIT: Nevermind, I misunderstood your comment.
@_date: 2018-01-08 16:42:20
So everybody should be a Bitcoin dev according to you. Got it.
@_date: 2018-01-08 23:16:36
I bet you there's many people out there that says "give me the keys and I'll do it" as shown by the various forks of people wanting to do the changes that haven't been accepted to the reference implementation. 
But guess what, they won't give the keys... so they effectively have a monopoly on the Bitcoin protocol.
So they have a responsibility with us, I really don't understand why some of you say they don't. Because they don't have a direct pay from the network? Not all the responsibilities come from a money payment, this is a moral/ethical responsibility.
@_date: 2018-01-04 20:00:42
There is effort involved in anything crypto. Today there is more effort involved in making a LN transaction than most people is willing to do. It is expected to be reduced in the near future (and that is what normal people will feel like a LN deployment, when it is seamless for normal people because it gets integrated in common wallets and services).
If effort was the only thing that stopped people from "endorsing" some new crypto technology please explain me how there are some basically unusable, bizarre coins with double digit market cap gains today.


You're right on that. Bitcoin is today not suitable for small/medium payments, but neither is any other crypto because: 
a) they haven't solved scaling yet
b) they don't have a big enough network effect yet
c) a combination of A and B
@_date: 2018-01-09 17:45:25
Well, good to know.
Let's all be unethical then!
@_date: 2018-01-12 19:40:32
Yeah, the thing is that batching is a change that any competent dev team could do in 2-3 weeks (and I'm saying two weeks given the size of the company, a smaller company could implement it in days).
Segwit is more complex and Lightning on the other side is a serious computer engineering challenge.
Just imagine, the whole mempool being relieved in days for a change 1 SINGLE COMPANY CAN MAKE IN DAYS!!!
Also, batching can be undone easily if necessary. And fast.
(I even got mad typing this, how have they not done it yet?!)
@_date: 2018-01-31 18:57:36

There is an old saying that applies well to software engineering: "nine mothers can't have a baby in one month".

There is no good for anyone in having 1,300 "internets of value" and counting

@_date: 2018-01-12 20:43:46
I bet you there are at the very least a hundred competent devs and Bitcoin holders here that would volunteer their time to make a so simple f---ing improvement to their code so that they stop f---ing the entire network. (If dev power is what they are lacking apparently...)
@_date: 2018-01-08 06:37:50
Let's be honest.
At this point Bitcoin is the reference client: Bitcoin Core.
Unless they make the change, the change will not be recognized as Bitcoin by anybody. 
(Unless you are into "xxx is the real bitcoin" kind of delusions)
@_date: 2018-01-07 19:41:19
The real problem about BCH, at least for me and many other people, was the way they did the fork and the people behind it (few with any real technical background, some with very shady conflicts of interest, etc.)
Also, they didn't want Segwit enabled, which is an improvement endorsed by most technically capable people as necessary.
That said, even if you cannot continue increasing blocksize forever, which is true, you can add SOME block chain space while the more advanced engineering solutions are deployed in an emergency case like this.
@_date: 2018-01-09 17:47:10

@_date: 2018-01-08 06:35:31
That would be true if the core devs didn't have a monopoly on the development of this massive $250B network. They accepted a responsibility and should act accordingly for their users.
It's a privilege for them to be at the center of this historic technology, not the other way around.
@_date: 2018-01-12 19:18:10


For who?
The thing is this is a nascent technology with limitations that will be gradually solved in the future.
They are making huge business from this technology and should ensure they HELP the network and not the opposite, at least while the technology matures and this kind of issues are solved.

The important thing about bitcoin is not if it resembles the traditional banking system or not. I would go as far as saying that the more it resembles traditional banking, the better for getting to the common people.
The truly important thing about bitcoin is that instead of fiat you use, well... bitcoin!

They are not contradictory, they are both true.
It is true there are already working implementations being tested on tBTC.
It is also true there is no clear and definitive release date for LN on mainnet.

@_date: 2017-12-20 08:06:15
"Nearing" as in it's already being tested but it is not clear if the deployment will be in 1 month or 6 months.
What is so hard to understand?
@_date: 2017-12-19 09:26:13
Ok, let me elaborate:
Your hardware wallet holds THE PRIVATE KEYS to you Bitcoins (there aren't "Bitcoins" in there, just the keys with which you can sign transactions).
So in case of a fork, nothing happen to the private keys.
@_date: 2017-12-01 05:46:10
Yeah but what that means is that huge gains is not a synonym of impending failure, there are some assets/stocks that prevail.
@_date: 2017-12-06 06:52:08
If Bitcoin already attracted the "gamblers" of the world, we would already be at $100k+

When you see a 50% increase in 24 hours, it is very, very probable you'll see a sizable correction soon.
Buying at the top and selling at the bottom is the surest way to lose money fast in crypto land.
@_date: 2017-12-01 18:20:46
Oh no... maybe what I forgot to tell you is that I'm a proponent of BTC as digital GOLD. I think it has not worked well, nor will it work well in the near future as digital CURRENCY.
So FIAT will still be predominant for international commerce for the foreseeable future, there's no doubt about it.


I'd like to know how would you think all world governments will first, agree on that, and then do it.
That's the beauty of Bitcoin, if it remains easily transactable (not necessarily legal, just transactable) in JUST ONE JURISDICTION in the world, all the other markets become perfect locations for underground usage. So it would have to be a very sophisticated worldwide ban to really maim its long term potential.
@_date: 2017-12-01 17:24:20


This is where I think most "experts" get scared. Every single thing in the history of the world has been unprecedented once.
This is a phenomenon of the digital era. Think about it, now you can be camping in the middle of nowhere and connect to a global network to see a Netflix movie or do a Google search to look for survival information if needed.
This is unprecedented but it is not going to stop (unless a massive solar flare or something that extreme, of course)
With bitcoin it is the same: 10 years ago there was no way to send value over the world in minutes without passing through several middleman, each of which took its cut of your payment and saw and stored all your information without any respect to your privacy. Also your payment depended on the authorization of several actors in order to allow it go from A to B.
Now, that is possible with Bitcoin.
Think about that and you tell me if $10k a coin is unsustainable when probably not even 1% of the world population has tasted the future yet.

This is true, but these are the early days when some people are chasing the "next big thing", the "bitcoin killer".
If and when bitcoin sorts out it's challenges (scalability, extendibility, etc.) money/value will tend to concentrate on one or a few coins because it's the way it is most useful for the world.
If there is consensus that Bitcoin is the one network with value, there won't matter if there are other 10,000 copycats. It's all about consensus.

This one. Heck, I'd prefer 99% Bitcoin at $1k
I want an alternative to fiat that can't be diluted as easily as fiat. If we accept 100s of competing coins are "stores of value" we're putting the concept of digital scarcity in risk.
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:56:21
Of course.
To achieve true decentralization, you have to be able to run Bitcoin nodes with as little technical requirements as possible (CPU, memory, storage, bandwidth).
If block size is increased a lot (and you'd really need to increase it a lot to achieve mainstream usage level capacity) you start to require a lot of all those parameters I described above to run a node, so the consequence is that nodes start to be run only by entities with a lot of resources (usually corporations and/or governments) which are more easily forced to comply with any kind of official requirement (e.g. censorship) than if the network is really maintained p2p.
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:03:20
I perfectly understand what you are saying and don't necessarily disagree with you.
I think Core devs should give a clear roadmap for full LN deployment and also consider temporary measures if deployment is not near enough.
We are risking serious damage to our "network effect" and "first mover advantage" if this doesn't improves soon.
@_date: 2018-09-12 05:14:02
Thank you for your opinion, but I don't agree with it.
@_date: 2018-09-11 21:39:25
I agree with you, in the "store of value" realm there are maybe space for a couple coins other than bitcoin.
But... 1900+ coins/tokens competing for "store of value" status? That's a threat for the whole concept of digital scarcity.
@_date: 2017-12-01 06:41:29


Yeah... well... this would be more impressive if we supposed all this uber rich guys got uber rich only by their smarts and not by abusing the system.
I have yet to hear a truly rational critic of cryptocurrency from:
1) Someone who actually understands what it is and how it works, and...
2) Someone who hasn't benefitted greatly from the "status quo" and cannot even fatom any sort of disruption to it.
Most common criticism from this type of guys is "it is not backed by a state" as if "states" and "statesmen" are the only ones that have a God-given right to back a store of value/medium of exchange.
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:20:49
This doesn't look good at all.
The fact that they felt the need to make this announcement is, in itself, a reflection of how bad this situation actually developed.
@_date: 2017-12-01 06:26:00
Treason/sedition/counterfeiting for using bitcoin?
That would mean your country became a totalitarian regime.
Fortunately it is improbable all 200+ countries become totalitarian regimes at once, so you could perhaps move to a different country with more fair and rational laws.
@_date: 2017-12-01 17:16:54


There lies your trouble understanding this.
The idea behind crypto is that states can do jack sh*t about it.
I'm not saying it is a sure thing crypto will triumph but each day that passes seems to confirm it is anti-fragile.
You seem very interested in not changing your preconceived ideas about value. I invite you to open your mind and think about the current reality: a digital asset, invented by an unknown person or group of persons is about to be 10 years of age, while going from 0 users to millions of users worldwide and from $0 USD value to $10k value. And also sparked over a thousand alternative currencies with it.
Just think about that for a second and try to reconcile it with your preconceived ideas and paradigms.
This is called disruption. You either embrace it or experience the Blockbuster experience.

@_date: 2015-12-10 07:05:41
Certainly plausible. People here seem afraid and even offended about this possibility mostly because Satoshi is now an idealized myth. But there was definitely a human being behind Satoshi (maybe more than one), and we know no human being is perfect.
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:01:15
That's correct.
For obvious reasons, Bitcoin tends to concentrate in strong hands (people who won't panic sell easily) over the long term, which means, less bitcoin in the market.
If the demand is steadily increasing, as it has been for the past few months/years... it means serious upwards pressure on price.
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:10:54
Ok, I'll bite to your half assed troll attempt.
High fees are currently an engineering problem that is being actively worked by talented, experienced engineers from all around the world.
When an engineering solution is applied that solves the problem (and there is one nearing deployment, called lightning network), the case for most competing altcoins disappears overnight (and with it, market interest for most of them too).

@_date: 2018-08-23 19:23:29
On the contrary, they were artificially inflated by two things:
1.- A general crypto bull market
2.- A sense that BTC was "failing" and that the next Bitcoin was about the be born. Now a year later it's clear that was 99% FUD and they are getting back to where they belong.
In my opinion 99% of alts are still grossly overvalued right now. There are 1800+ of them for a market that is still in it's infancy. Most of them should not be worth much higher than zero, it's simply ridiculous.
@_date: 2018-08-23 19:15:45

No, but seriously, this is a high risk, high reward opportunity. Do your own research and follow your OWN conclusions. Blindly following TV/online "analysts" advice won't take you very far in the financial world.

It may be funny but it's true.
In the scenario you're describing (pseudo apocalyptic solar flare or something like that), people won't turn to peacefully commerce with gold. At least not in the short term. Your best bet in that case would be exactly that: ammunition, medical and food supplies.
And by the time enough people is reinstating a civilized market, it is likely power and communications have been reinstated, at least partially.
I really hope we don't see that kind of scenario in our lifetimes, in which case Bitcoin will still be much more practical than gold.

In the interview, Munger said "it is artificial gold".
So he basically acknowledged what bitcoin actually is: digital gold.
The thing here is they, probably due to their advanced age and also their interest in maintaining the status quo, can't see or won't accept why there could be a valuable digital gold.
The thing is, millenials and subsequent generations can much more easily understand and appreciate the value of a decentralized, global digital gold.

Then I'll post here what I posted in the now deleted thread (is somewhat frustrating to dedicate some time to a post just to see it arbitrarily deleted):
Yes, I'm here to say Bitcoin... but just because I think it's a very efficient way to move money around. Obviously this is true only once you have Bitcoins (that's the good thing about Bitcoin as a store of value: they are scarce and will be even more scarce over time).
So, if you're facing 8% fees to move the money now, you could offer a small discount for your renter to get bitcoins for cash through a site like Localbitcoins.com or other way available in his country. He should first make sure that it is legal there to do so.
Once he has Bitcoins, he could send them to you (that's quasi instant and super super easy).
When you have Bitcoins in your wallet, you can do several things: 1.- Sell them for cash via Localbitcoins or another platform (I'm not sure your options since I'm not in the US, but there are plenty there). Also make sure you understand any legal implications for your jurisdiction. 
2.- Hold them for yourself in your wallet (their value have grown exponentially over the last 5 years and if the technology gets massive there's a lot of potential for more growth) 
3.- Pay for products and services directly in bitcoins (several big companies have started to accept Bitcoin as a form of payment. Companies as Dell, Overstock, Newegg, Expedia, etc. and very recently Microsoft too!!)
You should, at least, really consider this way of payment as it represent a lot of advantages once you get familiar enough with the technology. Me and a lot of other people, including very important and known people, consider this to be the future of payments and storage of wealth.
If you have doubts you could always refer to the community at they're always very happy to help newbies.
* Disclaimer: This is not qualified financial or legal advice. Consider that bitcoins' price has been fluctuating a lot over the last few months and it could happen again (for better or for worse). You should make your own legal and/or financial decisions based on your own research and knowledge.

I don't know specifically what articles you're talking about, but the smartest money I've seen talking on TV and on articles (I mean Wall Street guys like Novogratz, Goldman Sachs, hedge funders, think bitcoin as digital gold, not a currency).
And these views only reaffirm what I saw since the first day I discovered Bitcoin several years ago, so I think I agree with them.
The wonderful thing of Bitcoin is that, on the long term when price stabilizes, it will be usable as a currency too.
Care to think about that? A true hard asset that can be practically used as a currency too. Wow.
@_date: 2014-10-10 22:06:25
You think so? I think, considering they have basically no competition right now, their price is reasonable. It makes me think when there's competition, hardware wallets will be like $10 or less.

That's awesome. So basically with Circle.com and localbitcoins we could setup a "Credit card or cash in US" to "Cash in Mexico" remittance system for the millions of mexican migrants that send money home monthly... cheaper and faster!
Also I believe it's easier to find a Bancomer ATM than a WU location.
This is really incredible and could be one of the first bitcoin's killer apps.
Everyone interested in bitcoin success should promote this with others that might benefit.
@_date: 2014-10-04 22:49:11
Thank you for your post, but I'm not referring to big BTC holders (whales). They can do whatever they want with their holdings (free market). I'm concerned about the exchanges themselves. Do we know if they can be trusted? Imagine if you had that sort of power over a multi-billion market and no regulations in place for (almost) whatever you do...
@_date: 2018-05-28 17:57:53


This is how almost every risky investment works.


In my view, the only way this will be true is if bitcoin completely fails. There is certainly a possibility it does but simply by surviving, the ROI is almost mathematically guaranteed to exceed that of a savings account under almost every model you come with.
This will NOT continue forever, but we are really early still.

Please UPVOTE to avoid unnecessary, additional FUD.
[Mexico's biggest exchange says nothing changes for them, this only applies to banking institutions and newly-defined FINTECH institutions, Bitcoin use still legal in Mexico.](
[The public can send comments to the Central Bank HERE. They'll consider the comments and add to this regulation what they consider necessary.](
However, this is obviously bad news because Mexico was about to authorize "digital assets" into its banking system according to last year's fintech law. The error the law makers made was to add a provision to the law that stated that the central bank is the entity responsible of defining which digital assets are authorized. Now the central bank simply said "none"... even when that was supposedly not the intention of the recently passed law.
Let's hope the central bank gets some public pressure and/or the law makers add provisions to the law to avoid this kind of monopolistic behavior by the central bank.

Only if your country currency is the USD you may be "somewhat" safe from exchange rate fluctuations. Remember the US is not the only country that exists nor the USD is the only currency that exists.


Basically same answer than above. There are many, many countries that have seen 40-60% (and much larger) drops in value for their currencies in the last 30 years.
Do you want to know how many country currencies have seen increases of 10000% in value in the last 30 years?

Guys, seriously leave your paradigms out of the door for a second. Currency/stores of value are a human invention, not something only certain people can create as a God-given right (banks, governments, etc.).
You're witnessing the birth of a new asset class for the digital age. If there is enough consensus among the people, it CAN BE a store of value. It doesn't necessarily need anybody's blessing to be one.

In many (if not most) countries, you can exchange a thing for another thing and there is a way to account for that transaction in terms of national currency.

It has done pretty well for the past 5,000 years, I don't get your point. On the other hand, see the loss in purchasing power of the USD in the last 100 years (&gt;90%). And we are talking about the reserve currency of the world, just imagine the weaker currencies...


Well, actually it was confiscated from private owners for a long period in the USA and in some parts of the world you cannot (legally) transact directly in gold. Also gold has problems that crypto doesn't have, for example, gold is often counterfeited while Bitcoin is impossible to counterfeit, also moving significant quantities of gold across borders can be complex/impossible while moving Bitcoin across borders is as easy as sending an email.


Let me tell you that I actually see Bitcoin as an asset more than a currency, and I think current real world usage backs that statement.

The "get rich quick scheme" is only a side effect of the price discovery phase of a new, deflationary asset that works as a store of value.

Check this link:
There are only over 650k bitcoin addresses with over 1BTC balance.
That would mean, there are a maximum of 650k people in the world with 1BTC or more. 
HOWEVER, it is known many people own more than 1 address (a lot of early adopters own dozens of address each, with tens or hundreds of BTC in them)
So the actual number of people who own 1BTC or more is probably 100k or less (my speculation).
Imagine that: if all millionaires in the world (13.6M people, estimated in 2015) suddenly wanted to get 1BTC, they wouldn't be able to get it. Simple as that, they WOULDN'T BE ABLE to get just 1 whole BTC each.
This is just to illustrate the current upside potential of this new asset class. To be fair, there's also risk of a catastrophic event or series of events that bring the asset down and I'm not here to recommend anybody to invest their life savings on it, just to make you know the kind of risk/reward profile the asset has.
@_date: 2017-11-17 07:39:13
Not saying it will, but if it can go $300k, why not $1M?

@_date: 2017-11-06 17:35:19
One thing I don't understand is why it is so difficult for people to comprehend there can be new assets, different from everything we, as humanity, have seen so far.
It has happened before. If you study the history of money you'll see every time a new kind of asset was introduced, there's resistance from people who thinks it cannot be possible for the new asset to exist, and here we are in a world where there are dozens of financial instruments of all kinds that are perfectly valid.
This is just that: a new kind of asset of the digital age that is, once more, changing paradigms.

For a store of value, the most important thing is the network of consensus that recognizes, uses and promotes the asset as a store of value.
Bitcoin network is MILES AHEAD of the nearest competitor in that regard.
@_date: 2017-11-06 22:01:52
Well, yeah. Much more comparable to this than to tulips, which is the common comparison among people that doesn't actually understand crypto.

But tulips didn't have nearly any of the features that Bitcoin has and viceversa, Bitcoin doesn't have almost any of the disadvantages tulips had.
If you want to make historical comparisons, Bitcoin is MUCH MORE comparable to gold, not to tulips. (I think the gold bubble has survived pretty well the last 5k years at least)
I recommend you to open your mind and learn about crypto currency, I'm sure you'll be surprised if you do. And if you have any doubts, feel free to make questions here.

Why? This is a new asset class that works as a store of value. It is having an S-graph type of adoption growth. As a consequence, early adopters are making it big, and late adopters will gradually make smaller gains, or even barely any gains (but probably keep the value they store above another hedge mechanisms).

Is the US dollar your country's currency? For many other jurisdictions, BTC is as good as it gets for a store of value for the small guy. (Even with the volatility... at least one expects it to go up and down, instead of only down like many many country currencies)
@_date: 2017-04-28 18:45:05
Bitcoin is not a get rich quick scheme but has been the only crypto asset to work well as a long term store of value for several years now. Other alt-coins may have greater price increases in the near future but they're all less mature and it is basically a gamble at this point.
If you want to risk the less possible downside on your capital, you may want to chose the more mature asset that is bitcoin.
Having said this, it is important to note the upside potential of bictoin is still enormous as it is still only a niche asset that can grow several orders of magnitude.

Segwit and LN are very different.
Segwit is a protocol upgrade that directly affects the protocol (as in, the adoption has directly impacted the protocol capabilities).
LN on the other hand is a second layer. It can be adopted by 2 people or by 2M people and -if implemented correctly- it will bring benefits to those who adopt it. As in, if you and me want to pay each other instantly with barely any fees, we can hop on the LN once it is in production and we wouldn't care if we are the only two people using it, it will work for us two.
(I realize the topic is more complex than this but it's an oversimplification to illustrate the big differences between Segwit and LN in terms of technology and economics)

No crypto currency will replace fiat for common transactions (like buying a coffe) in many years, maybe decades. Not Bitcoin and much much less ETH, XMR or any other super complicated and hyped sh*t.
I see Bitcoin as a supra-national store of value. For now, it is enough for many people to be able to do a few transactions a year.
If need be, I'm confident the community will gradually find solutions without sacrificing decentralization and independence so early.

Short answer: It's the first thing in the history of the world that works like gold but in a digital, easily transportable way, that has amazing properties like censorship resistance and a built in, fixed monetary policy among others.

It can even benefit Bitcoin.
It has been made clear that big cryptos are not securities, but many ICOs are acting like securities and cryptos at the same time. Putting a stop on the massive proliferation of ICO tokens that fool newbies through social networks with the promise of almost instant riches would probably stop the dilution of the market and bring back the attention to the main cryptos.
In my opinion this would be beneficial for Bitcoin and major alts not only from the financial point of view.

Of course nobody can tell you if this is going to 19k again or not, but it is a matter of believing in Bitcoin long term success or not.

I don't follow Litecoin that close but I'm fairly certain LN is still mostly a concept looking for a solid, stable implementation and Bitcoin's multiple implementations are as close to reach that status as anything else publicly available in any other chain. 
So I believe you may have confused LN to Segwit, which was activated on Litecoin first and then BTC.

If 1 in 10 people worldwide uses and/or accumulates Bitcoin, total market cap would be way, way, WAY MORE than 1.8 T
It is just the nature of how market cap works.
It is not linear growth based on direct demand. Direct demand for the asset usually translates exponentially or even super exponentially to the market cap.
That is exactly what has allowed Bitcoin to be valued at nearly $20k with the relatively small user base it currently has.

A huge crash is probable just because of that you just said, however, we're so far away from mass adoption that I think it's more probable that will happen like from $50k to sub $10k or something like that.
As the numbers stand today, and barring a black swan event, it still makes a lot of sense for newbz to treat it purely like an investment stock.
@_date: 2018-02-02 19:46:52


Well, when you've had the same pattern occur over and over again, it starts to be obvious. 
I don't trade a lot but I'm starting to hit my head on the wall for not selling at 19k when it was so obvious for me I could get back in much, much cheaper and increase my stack substantially. I think it was pure laziness because the writing was on the wall for anyone to see it.

The main feature of crypto coins is that they are a medium of exchange/store of value based on consensus and not on the use of force. Fiat money is IMPOSED to the people while crypto is based on the consensus of the people, simple as that.
As much as Mr. Gates looks great with all his philanthropic labor, it is actually impossible for him at this point in his life to understand why that is important given that he is and has been the richest man on earth for the past decade and a half.

The thing is there's a reason why they don't want to implement a block size increase now (in my opinion, and I'm a technical guy, it is a very good one).
Do you think if they get "fired" from the project in the way S2X is intending to do, the core devs will gladly continue contributing their time and skill for free to a corporate controlled project? (I don't speak for them but I personally wouldn't)
The most probable outcome is they either leave the crypto space or they get behind another project (which would then be super pumped by core supporters and in turn dilute S2X value inevitably)
Do you want to tarnish and dilute Bitcoin brand? Because that is exactly how you achieve it.

You have something very wrong here: blocks/coins don't magically have monetary value.
The (currently very high) monetary value that PAYS MINERS comes from the users of the system that are willing to exchange money/product/services for those coins.
So if you think the most important component of Bitcoin or any other digital currency are the miners you're seriously misguided. 
Also, that is the reason why if the majority of the users follow a POW algo change, current miners would lose A LOT of money.

BTC, in my opinion, is not and will not be a currency in the short-medium term. It is a fluctuant store of value with unique properties (fixed supply, international, easily transferable, censorship resistant, economic cycle independent, etc.). That alone, will make it live and probably increase in value over time.


BTC at 1k, 2k, 3k, 5k is equally useful for me and many other people, and that fact will probably get it over 10k again soon enough. But however, that is not the point of my post.

What did it for me is that, when the news first came to light about DK/CSW involvement in Bitcoin, someone posted a link to a Bitcoin news article from 2014 where DK's father put a Facebook-timestamped comment asking the author of the article, if he knew anything about his son's involvement in creating Bitcoin.
I think having that little piece of evidence, of an apparently ignorant member of DK's family asking for any info about DK's involvement in creating Bitcoin, way before CSW came to public light, is an important pice of the puzzle that convinced me DK and (unfortunately) CSW had something important to do with the very very early Bitcoin network.

Code doesn't define what is Bitcoin.
People defines what is Bitcoin and currently the consensus is the protocol that follows the rules of the reference client at github/bitcoin.
If you want to change those rules and still call it Bitcoin, you'd have to convince the majority of the people to recognize your new rules as Bitcoin. If you don't it won't matter if you have a lot of mining farms turned on, people won't recognize it as Bitcoin, that is the beauty of the system and what many people doesn't seem to understand.
@_date: 2017-10-06 05:26:56
Yeah, they are setting the tune.
It will be very risky for other exchanges now to unilaterally change the Bitcoin moniker to another chain if the original chain continues existing (which almost certainly it will).
I'm almost sure this is the first of a cascade of announcements that will make S2X event similar to BCH.

Eric, thank you for your response.
Ok, I've always thought you're a pretty reasonable person, so let me ask you these two questions:
1.- How do you justify supporting a technical stance that is being promoted by mainly business people and a few technical people with very known technical blunders in the recent past when it is against the recommendation of some of the most authoritative technical people on the planet, some of who pioneered the very technical concepts that let Bitcoin exist? (Before some commenter yells "appeal to authority", who would you trust on black holes most, Stephen Hawking or Kim Kardashian? - Not pun intended)
2.- I don't want to sound too "ad hominem-y" but, S2X would basically remove some people from the control of the protocol and put some new people in charge. How do you justify this power grab when some of the people that would be in control of the new version of the protocol have very well known history of shady/unethical conduct?
I think if I receive a very concise, reasonable and fact based response to these two questions, I may do a 180 turn on my view of the S2X project, and I think some people might be like me on this matter.
I hope you can take the time to explain your logic.
@_date: 2017-10-06 05:21:22


According to who?
In Bitcoin there are no God given rules or even previously tested legal theories. The supposed beauty of the system is that every player does what is in their best interest and the system will sort itself out and find the "equilibrium".
If a major exchange like Finex says that they'll list as BTC only the coins of the chain that follows the rules of the reference client (github/bitcoin), what are you going to do about it? (You can stop using them, but that's basically it)
With only one major player/exchange that does this it becomes a really difficult situation for the "dissidents" because the status quo always has inertia.

Hey, I agree with you, it's only that at this point there is not an incontrovertible measure for user support.
Some say it is hashing (we all know that is controlled by a dozen pool owners), some say is nodes (but someone with deep pockets can start 100 nodes instantly), so there is no easy way yet.
Money flow to biz/services is a very good measure but it tends to be a lagging indicator as in the case you describe.

Bitcoin has showed to be an asset class that in this early, illiquid, volatile stage has it's peaks every 2-4 years on average.
If after at least 4 peaks in it's recent history, you buy exactly at that 2-4 week peak window, when the price has gone so parabolic that the graph seems to be going backwards, erhm... maybe investing in any non-fixed income asset is not really for you.

It's extreme but it is an option if a few men in suits think they can impose decisions over the majority of users.

First: the comment doesn't sound well coming from this guy in particular. He's not even a "neutral" Nobel prize winner economist, he's simply the guy most affected by this new competition...
Second: guys like this are completely out of touch with people's realities. They basically live in the bubble of the elites, so, how could they understand social movements like this?
Third: in his remarks, he compared bitcoin to "alchimists" like Isaac Newton trying to create gold, which is a completely wrong comparison because Bitcoin doesn't try to be anything else, Bitcoin is it's own kind of new money/asset. (Also, alchimists couldn't create gold because their technology was primitive, I wouldn't be surprised at all if technology in the near future allows to create gold from other substances)
Fourth (and a more personal remark): He says central banks have "trust" and among other almost unquantifiable number of events where central banks have messed up big time, affecting mainly the common people, how on earth are we supposed to trust the words from a guy that doesn't even have the willpower to control his calorie intake? Amazing really that this guys have the guts to talk BS like this in public...

Exactly, this guys are totally hype-driven.
They hear any marketing about "the next big thing", "the future of crypto", etc. they see more "modern" logos and names and think Bitcoin will be easily replaced.
What has been clear here is that crypto adoption is not as easy as opening a FB account. In case you really created the best crypto ever, the best way to distribute your coins to ensure at least as wide a user base as Bitcoin has today would actually be an airdrop to Bitcoin users (in which case Bitcoin owners would be equally benefited).
If you didn't do this, you'd end with an even much more concentrated distribution of coins than Bitcoin has, which would totally be counterproductive for your intention of replacing Bitcoin as the leader.
@_date: 2018-07-02 17:33:25


Debatable, but ok, that's your opinion.


There's absolutely no evidence of this. On the contrary, there's plenty of evidence that this is NOT true.


Or maybe, only possibly, you're being downvoted for presenting your personal opinion as fact.
@_date: 2017-10-24 18:26:39
Depending on what's your point of view.
You can argue Eth is much more vulnerable to censorship/takeovers/etc if a small group of people can be bought/influenced/coerced to change the protocol.
I, as a crypto user, prefer 100 times a slow, expensive but uncensorable and decentralized alternative currency/store of value, than a centralized, censorable medium of payment. (There are hundreds of efficient digital mediums of payment already, that's not what Bitcoin came to disrupt in my opinion)
@_date: 2017-10-06 18:42:02
I actually don't think it is an attack on Bitcoin (as in they want to see it fail), I think it is an attack on the current team of developers (as in they want to own and control Bitcoin).

Hmm ok...
But then again, Ethereum is really the first popular platform of it's type. If what Ethereum does can be done in a "provably safe" way, what platform do you think will be chosen by corporations?

Fiat is "frictionless" as compared to Bitcoin? I suppose this "Nobel winning economist" has never had to send a remittance to the other side of the world.
Central banks "occasionally abused their privilege of creating fiat money"? Occasionally? Well, the joke tells itself.
What the hell? Either this kind of guys are stupid or are so in bed with the establishment that their minds cannot possibly see much further than their own nose.
EDIT: After reading some of the comments on the actual piece... man, oh man... how terribly misinformed most of the people is. This makes me incredibly bullish about crypto, as it shows the level of penetration in the general public is still minimal. There's so many people still waiting for their "A-ha" moment...
Also, not a single comment about Krugman's assertion that fiat has value because "people with guns says so" (like that's a good thing...)

Bad news: yes, it's early stages software with plenty of errors still.
Good news: turns out we don't really need it working urgently. With segwit and batching (and a little less SPAM and bubbly hype) we have some time to have it working properly without a bloated mempool.
Best news: no other coin has a working, proven and flawless scaling solution, and it would be extremely hard for any of them to get it right at the first try, so no matter what your favorite altcoiners tell you, Bitcoin is still a state-of-the-art protocol for what it does.

Rare as it may sound, psychology influences poor and rich people equally.

It is actually much worse than that. Electronics usually cost MORE in less developed countries because of weak currencies and shipping/import fees.
If there were already 1,000,000 nodes running today I wouldn't care if 30%-50% went down because of costs, heck, even 80%, but there are still only a few thousand full nodes running (many of which are companies and miners) so a drop in home nodes from the current status quo certainly would imply centralization of the protocol.

I will keep some (if not all) of Bitcoin (China version) tokens just in case. But at this point I think it is the healthier thing to do long-term.

After segwit is implemented, if we don't see clear improvement in confirmation times, fees, 2nd layer solutions, etc. There will be a clear and UNIFIED community push for bigger blocks.
However, I don't see the contrary to be true, because big blocks would probably give an instant improvement of confirmation times and lower fees, but probably sacrificing more and more decentralization as time passes.
That is why I support segwit first and I will be a staunch supporter of bigger blocks later if need be, but not before segwit gets implemented.

What about big greedy miners growing so big that they centralize mining (similar to what is happening today but worse).

What about a government (or a few) offering to buy/invest that "centralized" miner to control Bitcoin (lets not even talk about coercion).
What about a big greedy miner causing problems on the network to manipulate the market (shorting for example).
These are only a few examples of ways greedy miners can (and probably do) act in ways that benefit them but not the Bitcoin network.
What makes bitcoin secure is not greed of miners but "market selfishness", which combines a lot of participants, some acting out of greed and some acting out of principle.
All this in a worldwide decentralized network across different jurisdictions.

You have two options now:

2) Continue delusional thinking that Ethereum at this point in time and development, somehow justify a 20x growth in 3 months with no real corrections.
It has been tempting for any crypto investor to enter Eth since it grew to $100 (it was clear there were noobs literally trowing millions to ICO's that won't deliver) but it is all a house of cards. Mainstream Eth adoption and recognition is NIL. There is no way this doesn't end in tears eventually, maybe you have the guts to "invest" now and take a few more sucker's money but the bubble will eventually burst and the bigger it grows (and outgrows Ethereum current actual capabilities and technology) the bigger the fall will be.

With all due respect, it seems to me you don't know much about startups.
Tech startups, specially with the "futuristic" value propositions (lacking a better word) as the ones being funded by ICO's, are usually years away from being profitable.
That means, they will "burn" through their initial funds/capital (it's actually called burn rate in startup jargon) which mean, they will actually have to cash out their Ethers in order to survive and (supposedly) deliver their value proposition to the market.
@_date: 2017-06-21 16:38:11
So you're proud "your coin" can be used to fund $100M dollar SCAMS daily.
(And yes, they're scams as: 1) Many of them don't really need a token for anything, 2) Their lack of fundraising cap says they are all in just for the money, why else would a startup with just an idea be confortable with raising $100M+ from unqualified investors?)

It certainly has more features (all of which can be perfectly done in Bitcoin's second layers). The problem is why would we need decentralized execution of code in a blockchain in the first place and how can it scale.


How? Price wise? If so, sure. Congrats on your gains, I hope they last once the ICO house of cards fall.

Bitcoin is worth 3 times what it was when all this started. Number of transactions breaking records. Hash power increasing steadily.
As much as I'm as desperate as you about the stalemate, this Eth and alt bubble has little (if anything) to do with the scaling issues.
In my opinion it is 99% about a new form of gambling: ICOs.

Segwit2x has Jihan at the driver's seat.
Enough said.

One thing is being against over regulation.
Another very different is seeing some rampant scams going on without control and saying "let them do it because dumb people deserve it".
Some laws are in place so that dumb/disadvantaged people are not scammed out of their money legally.
One thing is to be pro-freedoms and another is wanting to live in the wild west.

Wow, this needs more visibility.

This is why we can't have nice things.

However, the number of burned investors was vastly superior to the number of investors with positive results.
@_date: 2017-06-12 16:33:45
Totally agree. But let's not confuse it with fundamentals.
Fellow bitcoiners: maybe we should ramp up the shilling squads in other subs. It seems to be working for others. /s

If left unattended, THEIR bad investments can (and will) affect yours, his and mine when this blows off.

Or at least this is the most prevalent use after 8 years.
Not many people have been interested in the "buying coffees with BTC" so far. If that was the main selling point, it would have disappeared by now.

I said pressure from the community (miners, businesses, users), not from the core devs. Time has shown it is much harder to get additional hashing power than it is to get new code.


Well, the guys who actually have developed the code that runs it for the last few years think otherwise. So there's that.


I would support that if done simultaneously. I don't trust this guys to do the right thing after they got their way. After much time and analysis I think there are enough arguments to not trust them on this.

Keep the delusion into Eth sub please.
After 7 years, I have very technical friends barely learning and asking questions about Btc. Do you think they'll go directly to Ethereum? Be serious.
I don't care if Eth is $1000 USD tomorrow. Until Ethereum proves it is capable of doing at least 10% of what every pumper thinks it's going to do (and not only a platform for scam crowdfunding) I'm not going to put a dime on it.
I congratulate the ones who can profit hugely from the misinformed/greedy but it is a house of cards and time will show it (unfortunately for most, maybe even for us bitcoiners as the whole crypto space will probably be affected).

The question here is why on earth is he trying to do this under the circumstances you're pointing out when there is code ready by people who has been actually involved for the last 2 years.
@_date: 2017-06-22 01:56:04
If you're constantly here, you get tired of constant sub brigading by eth fanboys.
Also, there are some very valid arguments against eth and specially against ICOs that should be said so that noobs know both sides of the story.

After long research, consideration and immersing myself in discussions in both r/bitcoin and r/btc, I don't see it that way at all, but I respect your opinion.
That is why we probably need to divorce in order to continue ahead.

It doesn't matter how you put it or sugar coat it (with or without malice). 
The mere existence of ASIC-boost is a long term danger to Bitcoin and must be fixed ASAP.
