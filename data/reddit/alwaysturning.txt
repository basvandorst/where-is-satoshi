A while. I dont have a cc only a debit which apparently they dont take. Either way ill get e ball rolling soon. Thanks to for the tip, i can see it pending in my circle app so at least i know it's working.

If i keep money in bitcoins and some shit goes down with the dollar will my coincs still retain value....or gain value? Or is the relationship between currencies different than im understanding?

What's recommended to deal work US policies? The whole point is to our independence from government and banks as much as possible i dont want anything thrown at me for not using the dollar.

If I'm just buying bitcoins to save and then transferring back to dollars when i want to purchase something will i be alright? That's not really business.

Im trying, i just want to see something show up in There, ha... Does it take time for all transactions...buying, selling and even the tip things? I was thinkin i could purchase much faster.

Im sorry, one more question....is circle secure? Do i need to worry about securing my bitcoins or if i leave em in circle are they protected?

I just don't understand how it even derives or holds any specific value. Or I guess I understand it, it's just hard to accept. But then again I think the same thigs about any other popular currency. Is it all mass imagination?

thank you. maybe I just have some problems wrapping my head around it but everything I read just kind of confuses me more, haha.
