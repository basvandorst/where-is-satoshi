It's weird, who would like to pay/receive an amount of bitcoin that won't have the same value in 3 or 4 weeks. That's a very risky way to handle a business.

Bank are usefull but just don't forget they are commercant and want to make monney.
At this point the bitcoin protocol doesn't provide any post payment security wich is why imo It's far from mature enough to be accepted as an everyday currency. 
In the future banks will probably be the entry point of cryptos imo (like exchanges)
@_date: 2018-05-27 07:29:25
Very ignorant post.
@_date: 2018-05-23 20:09:58
Bank has the advantages to be backed up by the governement, even tho they are diabolised they will still give this illusion of security to the lambda citizen.
My guess is that a semi centralized version of the blockchain might be used as a crypto currency by the population when the banks (or the banks hidden behind another entity) will implements and diffuse it.

The computing ressources dedicated to transactions are minimals.
The majority is used the by the part that manages the investissement of the banks. You might consider it as a waste but it's not for the bank since it's how they make monney.
If he just wanted to vent about the energy wasted by keeping some devices on I'm totally agree with that but it's not bank related.
@_date: 2018-10-23 07:36:08
While the technology and functional problems aren't fixed (scalabilty, key lose, steal of btc, death of btc owner etc..) saying that block chain can  be used to support a currency on the same scale that the major Fiat (EUR, USD etc..) is like when people say we would have an overboard in 2015.
Also I don't see why the next generation will have more knowledge than the current to use a currency this much vulnerable to market valuation. 
Expecting this has as much value of a D&amp;D dice throw.
@_date: 2018-10-22 15:20:46


I don't know what a IOU is. 


I don't know what your theory is but the one I answered to was based on hypotetical fact, "if the bank buys bitcoin", " if x does y" while mine is based on what is the current state of the block chain and what I can notice in the market.


Quite pretentious and irelevant.
@_date: 2018-10-22 10:21:02
Yes but only in the context of the message I'm answering to. 
It's a bit like a proof by the absurd, you start by aknowledging the statement and then you demonstrate that you get an inconsistant result if you aknowledge that.
It's quite common.

Yeah, now it's just anniying stressfull no
@_date: 2018-10-17 07:01:46
Isn't that the other way around ? Mining consume a lot more computing power than  validations by a trusted party.
And I think I don't understand your logic, why would the increase of the market cap would duplicate the machine for the banks and not for the blockchain ? I mean, an increase of the market cap would probably mean more people would inject their Monney, more monney -&gt; more transaction -&gt; more miner -&gt; more computing power used.
 It would be the same for the banks but as far as I know their validation protocol is still far more performant. 
And by that I mean that if the traditional validation was used to validate the actual number of bitcoin transaction , it would cost a lot less.

@_date: 2018-10-22 09:18:04
Why would it be stable ? For centuries ?  This statements comes a bit from nowhere.
"But lets say people really trust bitcoin and we are at the point that everyone use it as main way to do commerce it will be very stable." 
Still a massive challenge but yes sure, but my theory is based on what I believe is the actual state of mind of most people in the crypto market.... They don't give a fuck. They want to be rich, if you remove that (stability of the coin price) a lot of cash will go out, like a lot.
And for now there is still so many things that make the bitcoin not usable as a currency, steal, death, lose of private key etc...
I don't see how we could manage that without regulation but if we reach this, it will only be bank 2.0
@_date: 2018-10-22 11:41:33
Why would this be FUD ? I just bring a counter argument 
@_date: 2018-10-29 08:15:43
If bitcoin became the global currency do you think this kind of thing won't be in place ? Even with this kind of system people get scammed every day.
If bitcoin became a global currency without regulation the average dude will lose 70% of his asset because he don't know or won't take the time to learn how to use it.
And you say long live btc just for this ? Go fuck yourself retard.
@_date: 2018-10-23 07:04:07
From what I can see, the bitcoin doesn't bring the plus value needed to justify its adoption in a developped economy.
The best use I found so far is one dude telling me he couldn't extract cash in LasVegas (bank restriction in this area) so he transfered his bitcoin to a bitcoin machine on which he could trade cash.
Very usefull on shorts time period very risky if you stay exposed to the market too long.
@_date: 2018-10-22 12:09:12


And they can also bring it down. The difference is that Amazon is a company, the investor invest their monney so it can be used to make the company grow and eventually make gains in the future.
On the other hand, the bitcoin investor's monney has no direct impact about the progress of the block chain. 
Investment banks already trade financial instrument based on bitcoin. But all that is vastly speculative and does not proves that it will adopted soon or in the future.
The rest of your message is very hypothetical so I can't really deny it or agree with it.
@_date: 2018-10-22 09:26:20
The gains people can eventually make trading/investing in crypto.
@_date: 2018-10-23 19:34:56
You're salty as fuck and I'm the one crying lol.
Keep fighting with yourself, at least I bring argument ,you just come to trash talk.
And yes you sounded pretentious and was in fact irelevant i didn't take anything out of context, the tears seems to be yours.
@_date: 2018-10-22 06:34:00
Once it's stable you will see everyone leaving the boat because 70% of the people in for the "technology" are hypocrite only here for the gains. Then it will fall down and people will buy again and then it will pump etc..
EDIT : for the people having trouble understanding my point ---&gt; bitcoin won't be stable.
@_date: 2018-10-23 17:33:14
Who pays for the lawyer ? You starts getting another third involved in one of the aspect of your portfolio ? 
I know it's not the transaction itself but the measure you suggested tends to go in the exact opposite direction of why the block chain has been made.
As I said in another message, I don't see how any of these problem (except the scalability) can be solved without involving regulatuon of a trusted authority (which totally againsr what the block chain stands for i repeat it)
@_date: 2018-10-22 15:10:17


I disagree, if a company starts to sell its stock the initial cash it will receive from the sells will indeed be the capitals that the company will directly use to increase his business. 
Maybe you were refering to the trading that come after, once the company finished the sell ?
Well even in this case a favorable stock price is critical for a company seeking equity finance and it's not the only exemple. 
On the other hand, the bitcoin speculation has no direct impact on his development, this same development  that will more likely determine if it will be adopted or not.
So no, you can't say that amazon was or is like bitcoin.

Kraken must have promissed them a quality of service over the common user, otherwise I don't see how they could do it.

really sad, the coin are getting crazy these day and bittrex seems to be a good exchanges, it seems we have a new bug... probably because they can't assume the increasing number of user

@_date: 2017-11-08 16:56:31
If only the problem was only the gateway, when I try to connect to my account from trade.kraken.com, I may also have the 504 http error. Even if the GUI change it's still the same database sever that I'm trying to reach and it fails quite often, I'm also quite sure I will have the same problem on every other API since when I could reach my account I also had error like "Cant load the data now, try later".

One week ago i've created an account on bittrex but the basic veriufication failed. I tried the enhanced verification but it also failed due to "Name mismatch" (but there is no missmatch).
I send a message to the support team I had an automatic answer and nothing new since 9 days.
They also advice to retry the enhanced verification but the problem is I fucking can't, there is no button to retry it. I just have this (see the picture) on the enhanced verification panel.
@_date: 2017-11-21 15:51:57
But i've read that it wasn't necessary to do it

@_date: 2019-01-07 23:09:55
I get what you mean, and I bet you assumed I'm anti crypto but I'm not at all.
Cherry picking is irrelevant here. You can't use "best asset" to describe one that lost 90% of it's value whatever the period you take.
The blockchain industry is developping fast and that's a good news but it's still not ready for crypto mass adoption in term of technoloy or use.

Well intermediate will be needed for the transition from Fiat to crypto. But coinbase will be useless if mass adoption eventually happens.
But anyway if bitcoin isn't regulated by legal entity , it is not propeely designed to work in our society.
