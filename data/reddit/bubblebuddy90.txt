I wish you the best!

I was worried that you wouldn't be able to actually "own" the coins and be able to withdraw them. But this is great news and I can see this causing a tremendous surge in the price of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-16 06:08:39
i think you ARE the community...
@_date: 2018-01-20 07:04:59
Ha! but is BTC backed by the "full faith and credit of the US Gov't" like my lovely USD is?? oh.. err..wait a minute....

According to the Robinhood FAQ:
"Can I withdraw my coins?
Yes. To get started with this process, you’ll need to send additional verification to customer support for security purposes. We’ll need a copy of:
    Your bank statements
    Two government issued IDs (front and back)
    A selfie with your ID
Keep in mind, transfers and withdrawals can take up to one week. Any fees incurred in this process, such as network and mining fees, will be passed along to you."

Honestly these really are incredible times, nevermind how bitcoin has gone parabolic, how about how technology has gone parabolic?? Can't wait to see what the next 10 years will bring.

Hey noobie here, would it really be so bad if the fee structure was fixed at 1Sat/Byte? Nobody could pay more than that, and transactions would just confirm in the order they occured.
The average wait time shouldnt change, and fees could remain stable and low. 
Currently, it kinda seems like wealthy individuals will have preferential treatment in confirming their transactions as is.

I really wish I had some money to place a buy order RN, this price is crazy.

Yeah the whole energy consumption argument is very flimsy. Sure it's costing the planet more energy now, but once crypto replaces banking infrastructure it will likely be saving us energy.
Perhaps the biggest thing holding BTC back is its scalability, but more effort and more support is being put into solving this issue than ever before right? 
@_date: 2017-12-15 06:40:50
It cometh indeed.
I really liked that part where Andreas touched upon how transitioning to a world dominated by crypto could actually be better for the planet's environmental health.
@_date: 2017-12-19 09:06:49
I feel the same way... Only thing that's stopping me is just in case I get a flat tire or get in a car accident or something along those lines, having that money readily available could make all the difference..
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:51:26
Yeah I was wondering if somebody knowledgeable could explain the same thing. I've somewhat garnered a lil bit about bcash from various posts, but I would really appreciate some actual reasoning as to what makes one coin better than the other. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 08:57:04
Perhaps consider sprinkling about 5% into icos or newer coins? Electroneum is relaunching this week and has some potential to be a winner. Some diversity couldn't hurt.
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:36:46
haha yeah

I may be mistaken, but I thought I read that Coinbase's USD-wallet is insured.
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:23:49
Good man!

Man that orange chicken looks good

I'm 28 and I've noticed this so much in just my lifetime alone. Fast food, movie tickets, groceries. Everything has gone up much faster than my income. I have to buy less each year and I think many of us dont realize what's happening because it's a slow process of getting less each year, but when you stop and look back a few years you can really notice it.
Lately I've been trying to put 20ish % of my income into real assets to fight this inflation-demon. Stocks, real estate, and even crypto are probably where you should aim to put your spare cash these days.
@_date: 2017-11-22 07:42:17
Yeah, that's what I was thinking, if anything it might turn a few more heads, which is always good!
@_date: 2017-11-30 10:36:38
Not too late at all.
@_date: 2017-11-30 10:06:59
So Steve Keen's major argument on this was that Bitcoin is simply growing at an unsustainable rate and in no way can be maintained in the long run, correct? 
But does this not seem like expected growth for what it is supposed to do? and by that I mean to replace fiat. In order for something to go from pennies to replacing fiat (which should happen around what, 1-5 million per coin?) in only 10-30 years time, wouldn't you HAVE to have some astounding growth?
I think Keen sees crypto as something along the lines of oil, or lumber or such, which is probably the only way he can wrap his head around it and which limits his perspective.

This is actually a great comment. You want to teach somebody about Bitcoin? At first, simply don't. Teach them about how our current monetary system works, let them ask questions about it and draw their own conclusions. This gives them a baseline so they can better understand the improvements crypto-currencies provide. After informing them of how things currently work with our fiat system, ask them if they think it is flawed, and if so, in what way.
