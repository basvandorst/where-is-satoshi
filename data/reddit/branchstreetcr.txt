UPDATE: I've got the new android device, and I've downloaded the Mycelium wallet. It is asking for the seed, and I can't find a way to give it only the public address. Anyone have any insight here to configure it to be a receive only wallet?

This is an interesting approach. Would it work if I had an android Mycelium device with the pub/pri keys for all currency, then use individual Electrum based mobile wallets for the xpubs?
I see a HUGE market for the dev team that opens up an integrated service for merchants. A two-app approach. The "POS" app has multi-coin wallets, receive or watch only. The owner "backend" app has the keys to move, convert, send, etc.  This is honestly what would help adaptation in the long run.
I'm a pretty tech savvy person, but trying to use many different wallet apps on one device is hard to train a staff to do properly.

Unfortunately we are addicted to Apple products, so  seems to be out. I'll look into integrating the 1-3 on our iPad and try getting that quick/simple to use.

Update: Looks like I'm shopping for a new Android tablet. This tablet will live to only process crypto payments, and the old iOS device will continue to do the rest of the work. 
Bummer that it has to be complex, but this seems to be the most user-friendly option out there currently. Will update when I get up and running with it!

This is awesome, thanks for compiling that. I'm going to drill into it now. Cheers!
