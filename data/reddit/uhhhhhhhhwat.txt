Ok if you're not down with the big bad bank rhetoric, how about quantum computers that will probably crack most bank encryption within 10 years? Who is going to update all those systems? There isn't enough well trained personnel to even lock down current systems. Some banks still don't even have case sensitive passwords. Bitcoin already has proposed mechanisms to deal with quantum computers. Oh and by the way the Chinese are beating the US in the quantum race by huge milestones.

No. Not true at all. Everyone who is aware of how money works is starting to consider bitcoin as a serious new asset class. Any half decent investor knows how to diversify and knows buying at least *some* bitcoin is a good idea.

I think its a good comparison IMO especially considering that javascript wasn't really meant to do all the things that it does today. First use cases were very rudimentary then some very smart and creative people just took it and ran and over time it grew into all these crazy things that make the web much better. :) I don't think anyone in '95 ever really thought something like Node.js would be a success. If you go back in time they would scoff at the idea.
