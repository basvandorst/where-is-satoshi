Investors invest money to make money.  Not to make Bitcoiners money.  These guys are going to be some of the most shrewd investors in the world surely.

That's a good point.

Right.  If they had the initial investment for buying, though, racking up on buys would be the safest bet.  Regardless, this whole situation hasn't fully played out yet.  Prices will drop a bit more before it's all over.

It will look a lot more like this

Did the exact same thing, on the exact same comment.

This is pretty fallacious.  Just because bitcoin is new does not mean that it is the future.  The bitcoin protocol would have to be modeled more after the current payment processors protocol for a processor to be interested.  Bitcoins protocol is rather weak for consumers/volume, especially for a scenario like going to the mall (multiple purchases within an hour).

I think it's a pretty terrible idea to allow the transaction ID to be malleable.  To be sure, when someone calls something an identity, it's confusing to explain to them that really is not the identity because somebody else came in and changed it.
Gox should have been on top of knowing that, but I am pretty sure that they have been scammed for a big chunk of coins.

In response to your point 1:
The capital lost from China will not incentivize more people in other countries to buy ~more~ because prices are lower.  People are generally buying in at a rate determined by their budget in their country's primary currency.
Also, seeing the price moving down won't inspire someone who isn't currently invested to buy in.  It may entice a current holder to buy a little more.
Bitcoin basically just lost 1.35 billion potential customers.  More than 1/6 of the world's total population.

The huge problem with this idea is that these coins were sold for less than half of the price on other markets.  It would have been much more smart to wait for withdrawals to be enabled, then sell them on another market.  An insider wouldn't be that stupid.

A known bug shouldn't exist for 3 years.
I also think that you are misunderstanding the issue with the TXID.  It's not that it isn't unique, it's that 3rd parties can change it to something else after it's been signed.

2 * 20 + 950 = 990

Since UTF encoding has a possible 1,112,064 characters, this isn't equatable for most people who think of characters as maybe A-Z0-9 or some special characters.  Basically each character is something like the equivalent 600 alphanumeric character combinations. 
This is misleading, because it's the equivalent of asking someone to brute force a 2500 character long passcode of random characters.
edit: and pointed out that my math was wrong by a huge margin.  Using good maths, a 4 character unicode password is the same brute force difficulty as about a 12-13 ascii password.

Yet [bitcoin days destroyed]( is nearly flat.  This is a sell off.

This article has a certain smell to it, that I can't place my finger on given how little I know about macroeconomics.
Can anyone ELI5: If the Chinese are attempting to devalue the dollar, won't that hurt their economy more than help?  Wouldn't this cause Chinese products to be come less appealing to American consumers, as their effective price would raise?  Aren't Americans the largest importer of Chinese goods?
@_date: 2013-11-22 16:20:47
Which means nothing if the dollar is collapsed.

Awesome! Thanks.  I never thought I would hear back on this question. =)
@_date: 2013-04-11 22:00:28
I just posted a lot of [similar questions](  I hope someone can answer. =)

This is like saying China is pro-Wow money.
@_date: 2013-12-23 16:33:56
Don't.
