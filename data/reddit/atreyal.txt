He won't believe anything I bring to him. It is on par with trying convince a someone their religion is wrong. Especially since he has "seen" gains to his account. Unrealized but it won't matter because that is what they are telling him he has. 
@_date: 2016-11-01 17:21:21
He is anyways. This whole thing is making me more worried for him since he is getting older and these scams are getting more elaborate. He need to put money away to retire not these scams. 
@_date: 2016-11-01 15:58:31
I am gathering it is fishy. 
@_date: 2016-11-01 22:05:42
yeah what I am hoping for he couldnt find any sources either.
@_date: 2016-11-01 17:22:48
It's is a lot to me. I imagine a decent chunk for him. Prob won't make him homeless but I don't want to see him invest more to the point where it is. He is talking about making this his full time business so the more I think about it the less I can "stay out of it"
@_date: 2016-11-01 22:05:09
He is a victim I hope. I dont think he is selling it as much as just buying for himself. He has never been good at these MLM schemes he gets into. Least as far as I know. I always hear about how great they are and then a few months later how much money he lost. Few grand here and there.
I appreciate the offer to contact him but it will do no good. First you are the enemy as you know and he just wont listen. You are a person who is scared of the new kid on the block and you dont want people to get involved in oneCoin because that will cost you money. All these people are against us succeeding and well you know the rest. Least that was how these conversations go and it went earlier. 
I told him you are willing to talk to him but i wouldnt hold my breath. Better he reaches out then someone he doesnt know send him messages that challenge his beliefs.
@_date: 2016-11-01 19:50:24
I did. No response back in that. Onecoin seems to be using a lot of their discussions on crypto currencies as endorsements. 
@_date: 2016-11-02 15:11:46
I might. For now I think I got to him a little bit to maybe not sink more into it. He wants me to drop it and not talk about it because he cannot counter any if my arguments. And anything he does counter with is direct propaganda from the company. 
I told him I had a unicorn in my basement, I said it so it must be true. He didn't care for it much but he quit giving me counter arguments from onecoin. But since he didn't have anything else he just wanted to drop it. I was told I wasn't ready for this type of investment and he shouldn't of got me involved. 
@_date: 2016-11-01 17:59:36
I do. I'll look in to it. Maybe I'll be surprised and get the money back. 
@_date: 2016-11-02 15:07:52
It is elaborate. Still I was told it was a two year long investment. I think in two years it will pay off for the scam artist running it. Wonder if they're not arrested by then how they will spin it to keep people invested. 
@_date: 2016-11-01 16:48:46
It wasn't my money it was his money. He just set up the account. I would never give him access to my accounts. 
@_date: 2016-11-01 16:24:56
I am just hoping he doesn't recruit people under me. Since he made an account under me there is no tell what is allowed. Really tired of him getting involved in all these scams tho. He isn't getting any younger. 
@_date: 2016-11-02 18:49:31
No idea. 
@_date: 2016-11-01 17:58:31
I don't know how he did it. Outside of using simething out if country. 
@_date: 2016-11-01 22:10:39
I would but I doubt he will watch it being in Finnish. I will so thank you. Maybe I can use something in it.
@_date: 2016-11-02 00:21:11
No. He is screwed if he can't get any if his money out. Ill send him that list if banks you gave me and see what happens. Doubt I can change his mind but maybe a miracle will happen. 
@_date: 2016-11-01 18:48:10
Well prob shouldnt have but I did copy and send what you wrote and a few others. Maybe some tough words will wake him up. Thanks. 
@_date: 2016-11-02 15:05:57
Yeah I watched it. He won't. Was interesting and pretty well done. Just confirmed what I thought anyways. 
@_date: 2016-11-02 16:59:14
Eh just got into a big argument with him. He is pissed. But he won't watch anything he has to read so it is moot. 
@_date: 2016-11-01 23:07:26
Wouldnt be the first time. Just hope it isnt more then he already has invested.
@_date: 2016-11-01 16:35:12
3 doesn't work. I lost count of how many of these Ponzi schemes he has fallen for. I doubt 2 will work since I read in one if those articles you can't invest from the US. I remember afterward him telling me he had to send money in some weird way. 
I am just gonna let it sit there. Doesn't seem like it is there anymore anyways. Just really frustrated and hope this isn't the scam where he allows himself to be wiped out. 
@_date: 2016-11-01 16:23:07
I was just gonna leave it in there. It is pointless to argue with my dad as he is the most stubborn ass I know. This isn't my first rodeo with an MLM/Ponzi that he has gotten involved in. 
@_date: 2016-11-01 22:25:55
He keeps saying I have to look at the people who are running this. Is there anything shady on Ruja I could give him? If she has a history like McMurrain it might make him think twice.
@_date: 2016-11-01 15:58:13
I just don't want to get caught up in something that will get me in trouble. If I can just sit on them and not have issues with my dad I'll do that. More worried about legal action being taken to people owning them since he set up an account in my name. Little pissed at that but nothing I can do with it now. 
@_date: 2016-11-01 19:52:11
Eh I am actually surprised at how well he is taking it. I actually got a lets see how it plays out. I am just trying to make sure he doesn't get suckered out if more money. 
@_date: 2016-11-02 00:19:55
It would fall a deaf ears. I called him and it was pretty much I shouldn't involve you and let's just agree not to talk about it. 
@_date: 2016-11-01 22:18:57
Probably the only market is other oneCoin members. Still not gonna touch it I think. Whole thing is just screaming bad mojo. He didnt use any money to vest my account so it can rot.
@_date: 2016-11-01 16:15:25
More I am reading from some of the articles you posted the more I want to grab my dad and scream at him. I think he invested 40k into them if not more. 
I have no idea how I could convince him to get out though. He is gonna lose his shirt. 
@_date: 2016-11-01 16:47:33
I have done it many times. It doesn't go the way you think. He knows better then me. I would have a better chance of a brick wall doing it then him. It would just create a lot of animosity. I really don't feel like getting into a fight with him about it.
And I did verify the email like a dumbass. I wanted to see what it was about and should if done my research ahead. He hasn't ever done it this way before but he has "doubled" his money this month and it has increased his faith in their system. 
@_date: 2016-11-01 17:08:54
He is just an impossible person. Hence why he is unable to stayed married. I can only take him in small doses but appreciate the suggestions. I'll look into maybe seeing him see reason. Doubt it will work but it might. Just been trying to avoid seeming ungrateful as he gave me this "gift" for my birthday. 
@_date: 2016-11-01 17:11:58
He tends to think he is smarter then he is on things he really knows little about. However this onecoin sounds like the worst one he could of gotten involved in. 
Wish I could just copy what you said but he gets too offended over stuff. 
@_date: 2016-11-01 16:30:42
He asked me for my email address and opened an account for me with 2500 of his own money I am guessing. He was telling me about it but all he said was crypto currency and to look at their website, not the reviews on Google. I slacked off since it was my birthday and Halloween and started looking into it today since he did it at like midnight last night. But no he doesn't have access to my finances. 
@_date: 2016-11-01 22:09:01
I dont have any coins just the tokens. I honestly dont even have a clue how it works other then it seemed fishy as hell at the start and got worse as I dug deeper. I suppose I could try but considering I found out that it is essentially illegal in the US I am kinda reluctant to try. As I have a sort of security clearance for my job the ramifications would not be worth it. Especially considering he funded the account from "profits" from his account.
@_date: 2016-11-02 02:40:34
Well I can't say the people running this are not smart. 
@_date: 2016-11-01 23:15:31
Well that and I can already see the argument being that they are just trying to buy the oneCoin at a discount to make even more money and scam people out. 
I actually called him and it went to the well i just wont talk about it method. So I guess that is done. Did find out Ruja resigned as CEO on Oct 1st as well. He mentioned they have a new executive but couldnt give me any names. Just that he was somebody latino from avon and maybe groupon. 
So i didnt watch the video you posted above but am I right in assuming that they are just closing people account for different reasons? So they "lose" everything based off of ToS violations or hacks? Prob watch it in a bit but just got done watching the Finnish Doc and need a break.
@_date: 2016-11-01 19:57:47
I think my dad is just dumb about stuff. This isn't the first scam he has fallen for. Usually he doesnt go quite this overboard with it though. 
Sad part is he runs a very successful business. I think he is tired of it and sees these as a way to actually have the financial freedom he always dreamed of. Unfortunately if it is too good to be true it usually is. Doesn't help that I am pretty sure as he gets older his mind is going. My grandfather died from Alzheimer. 
So it isn't always cut and dry. I don't think he is a horrible person. He is just very easily impressed by bad people. 
@_date: 2016-11-02 15:13:59
Hmm that might make him a bit more wary. See if that rocks him a bit. Might need a link if I can't find one tho. 
@_date: 2016-11-01 16:58:42
I don't think I can. He was never much of one to listen to reason. 
@_date: 2016-11-02 15:12:45
Thanks but not really interested in crypto at the moment. This is just another fiasco I didn't need in my life at the time. 
@_date: 2016-11-02 15:16:22
I think he was in his mind helping me. It's hard to explain but I don't think it was malicious. 
@_date: 2016-11-01 21:52:03
It worth a shot. And i did ask him for sources on them being involved since i could not find anything other then what you pointed out. The sad part is it looks like them endorsing crytpo currencies is being used by onecoin in their propaganda. I did just get an apology from him. I still thinks he believes in it but he was sorry for getting me involved. Some of that might be from me throwing a fit at him and challenging him on it. I usually dont because it is too much hassle and usually he does what he wants anyways.
No one knows how onecoin works though. They love throwing around the word blockchain on their site and in news articles they propagate. And all the info on their site says everything is done in house. So you just send them money and they mine for you. 
@_date: 2016-11-01 17:09:23
I don't even think he saw it as that way. It was his idea of a birthday gift.
