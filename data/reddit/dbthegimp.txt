On Oct 4th BTC touched 275 and rallied immediately with a surge of demand up to 300, whereupon someone dumped a 30k BTC Ask Order on Bitstamp which was then eaten by the market in five hours. This was an unprecedented show of demand and along with large increasing in volume since Oct 3rd to date, 275 being the top of the previous all time high, these indicators were enough for me to make the call that 275 was indeed the bottom of our 11 month bear market and we are in for some months of stability/gradual gains before we take off again. We are back over 400 and support is strong.
Any purchase under $400 with a stop loss at 275 (+/- $5) seems like a safe bet to me.

You are always cheaper than Coinbase with their fee included if that was unclear in my previous post.
That being said, I've never purchased at lower than Coinbase's base price without the fee, and I've been purchasing almost once a week (in the time that I haven't had an issue with my account). So perhaps you are not charging a "fee" but the price is usually "premium".

my friends know i've been successful and want to be involved and this method gives them a noncommittal way to own some.

Holy shit. I hope this inspires people to get in contact with their local government and start communication about what bitcoin is and why it is important for citizens and government.
I got phone interviewed by a panel of 6 from the Wisconsin Dept of Financial Institutions, in order to give them an idea of what at least one person is doing in our space, after contacting George Althoff, Communications Director regarding the legality of my bitcoin business which at this point Wisconsin has no stance on. The WDFI's purpose, and all state money transmitter regulators' purposes, are to protect the consumer.  These agencies need help understanding how consumers need to be protected.
By being transparent and opening the lines of communication between the people and the government we can only foster relations in our favor.

Make sure you backup your 2fa qr codes and encrypt them.
@_date: 2016-03-22 04:35:02
Best to get in the habit of not keeping your money on centralized services who can censor your funds such as Coinbase and Circle. Use them to purchase and then store in Mycelium.
Remember, Mycelium will create a new address each transactino but you can always reuse old addresses from that wallet, and the seed will restore everything. DONT LOSE THAT SEED!!!! Store it in multiple places.
@_date: 2016-03-23 13:30:01
What i do is build connections in the places i am moving money and find localbitcoins.com buyers to offload to at 3-5%. Then you look for cheap suppliers (exchanges, localbitcoins.com sellers, miners) and make money remitting your own money. You will need bank accounts or friends in both locations.

1) running the bitcoin core app on your computer 24/7 with port 8333 open on your router
2) a. you validate your own transactions instead of relying on someone else, like electrum or mycelium or airbitz. this means taking full advantage of bitcoins trustlessness.
b. you support the network by being a part of it. bitcoin is a peer to peer digital currency, and by running a node you are a peer.
3) because you have to have 100gb of free space to download the blockchain, and you have to use a little bit of bandwidth to run it (this can be managed)
4) a. download and install bitcoin core 
b. run 24/7 or as much as possible, and open port 8333 on your router.

Basically if you are doin it as a business you need to report to the fed and likely get a money transmitter or msb license. 
If you are selling your personal bitcoin you are just a user by fed definition and dont need to.
What it really comes down to is how much sales you are doing and how much money your making/moving through your bank. As soon as it becomes worth it, you'll have regulators on your ass.

No. If I was I wouldn't post something that could be considered negative would I?
As you can see though, I am demonstrating that it is NOT cheaper to buy in India, and Unocoin's spread is huge.
I promote honestly. Unocoin is useful because they are the only service in India that has Coinbase-like functionality (vending) in decent volume.

US Citizen living in India can confirm this is not the case. I also today agreed to be a promoter for Unocoin. I've never once seen a competitive spread or spot price from Unocoin vs the USA. Unocoin is the best service for buying bitcoin in India other than localbitcoins, and scams are a plenty in India. I think many of the Indian sellers on localbitcoins pump their profiles with fake data.
As of a few minutes ago, 
Buy Price
Coinbase including fee: $260.90
Unocoin including fee: INR 16735 ($262.96 per Google)
Sell Price
Coinbase including fee: $255.73

I disagree. Fuck the man, fuck the game, fuck the system. Time is the only truly limited resource humans have. Wasting time trying to play the game is philosophically wrong. Sometimes radical change requires radical moves. Sometimes an opportunity is too good of an out to pass up and not go all in.
Yeah you might lose a job and be up shit creek, but hey - nobody can take that btc. You might end up on the street or couch surfing or at home but you will live. And in 5 years if you put $1000 in you might actually have  enough to buy a house.

OK So after further research, if you gift someone bitcoin you don't pay tax if it is under $14k. The receipient has to pay capital gains tax - they inherit the time and cost basis of the bitcoin that the original owner had purchased them at.

Building a dream house in paradise with my wife. Off grid bamboo. Gonna grow food and catch water. Gonna have kids in a year or so. I surf almost every day. DJ on the weekends.
It wasn't easy or without risk or challenge or fear of failure. I decided BTC was my generations best hope of freeing ourselves from the slavery that is the USD. I ran the first BTM in my city during the bear market of 2014 and converted all profits to btc. I got contacted by the IRS and had to shut that down cuz getting Money Transmitter license was too costly. I quit working/graduated college in 2015 with a psych degree, moved oversees, started building a btc network there, and took the plunge to become a dedicated trader. I rode the bull market up for 2 years only going long. I've been shorting since January. Absolutely crushing it. I now work intermittently as opportunity presents itself. 
@_date: 2015-04-23 17:41:22

follow the links through FINcen's website on registering as an MT. It's not that user friendly but through a few hours of research you can figure it out.

I'm going to put this in the edit. I also used this service for remitance when I left my debit card in an ATM when I first got here. 
I wouldn't use this service again in light of my Credit Union Visa. Currently here is what you would pay to get 10,000 Baht:
Visa ATM 180 Baht + 1% international card usage from my credit union = 280 Baht fee = 2.8% fee to use Visa on a 10,000 baht withdrawawl. This percentage would be 1.9% if I used the maxed the transaction at 20,000.
Current coins.co.th price 7166
Current Coinbase price 225.31 + 1% fee
Current THB to USD exchange rate 7166=219.86 = 2.5% spread. This fluctuates slightly but expect to pay 3.5% + 30 Baht to remit from your USA bank account to a Thai ATM. With my Visa I can get 1% + 180 Baht. 
This situation applies only to those who do not have low fee banking services.

You could put an order in on bitquick.in with his bank info. There is a small fee with a small maximum cap to that fee, but I tried it (for around 1200 rs) to see if it worked and it worked great.
What happens is you don't need to register, then they connect you with a buyer who transfers to your bank account, then you verify payment by emailing them, and they release payment.

The easiest way is going to be a bitcoin atm or a local seller. coinatmradar.com and localbitcoins.com can help you find something in you area.
ATM process: Cash goes in, bitcoin comes out to your smartphone wallet (you need a QR code)
Localbitcoin cash meetup: Similar process. Meet public place with internet, you hand them cash, they transfer to your wallet.
For both processes you will pay a fee. Cheapest is Coinbase.com for linking your bank account.

Coinbase is probably your most secure option. Otherwise Bitfinex has a lot of good options.

Went through this with Joaquin. He guided me through the steps necessary to become compliant. I am now a registered MSB with a fleshed out AML KYC policy, and the Fed's bitch should they require it. But hey, a jobs a job right? Fortunately my state does not require licensing yet.
EDIT: He

If u r in the bottom 2 tax brackets long term cap gains is 0%. U can cash out like 35k of ur income as cap gains untaxed a year. $75k with a spouse.

Great points guys. Most people only see dollar signs.

You shouldn't be handlng that much money if you don't know what you are doing.

Yes yes yes. I love buying new lossless audio. A social platform like soundcloud+openbazaar would blow my mind.

Again proving, when it comes to Coinbase, blow it up on reddit.
