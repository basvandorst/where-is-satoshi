Grandval (Paymium guy) is also saying that bitcoin is not a currency, it's an electronic payment network.
@_date: 2014-06-15 16:31:42
Nah we need Theymos, I heard he's good at fundraising money

Telling someone who's black (who are most likely underrepresented in the bitcoin community) "oh, you don't look like someone who would understand Bitcoin"

@_date: 2014-05-27 22:57:07
Pseudoscience? No thanks.

If you have $50k on your credit card account, I don't think getting a card that works worldwide is a problem.
@_date: 2014-04-04 22:54:46
But Karpelès is French. 
so -&gt; 
@_date: 2014-01-24 17:54:36
Oh yeah, sure.
You know what, try to use that sentence on black persons, tell me if it sounds like a "conversation starter".
@_date: 2014-06-06 22:35:42
They have debit card, and can buy things on the internet.
OP is full of shit anyway
@_date: 2014-07-07 18:07:04
There's no law allowing you to eat cheese on Monday, so that's not legal too? 
@_date: 2014-06-03 18:47:57
À la lune !
@_date: 2014-03-23 14:14:52
@_date: 2014-01-25 00:26:17
I'm talking about the sentence : "Wow, you don't look like someone who would understand ****!"

 &gt; (Droit) Permis par la loi, conforme à la loi.
Tout ce qui n'est pas interdit par la loi est permis par la loi, cf ddhc de 89 qui a valeur constitutionnelle. 
Ton point de vue il te ferait un bon 0 en TD de droit surtout. 
@_date: 2013-03-19 22:33:48
I know, it was a joke because you used the word "point".
@_date: 2013-04-21 17:26:52
I think that's the joke.
@_date: 2013-12-29 16:06:06
So if I put my wallet.dat in an IBM mainframe, will it back my bitcoin?

Most people don't really know what to say when you tell them you bought at less than $10 and it's worth 150+ know. 
@_date: 2013-06-20 16:07:51
All in the game yo, all in the game. 
@_date: 2013-06-06 17:58:25
Chouette !
@_date: 2013-12-19 23:52:00

@_date: 2013-12-12 21:12:03
What? 
@_date: 2013-10-31 16:01:21
I am sure CEO Nwabudike Morgan will like bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-11-18 04:17:05
Yeah, you won't be the only one :p
@_date: 2013-03-19 21:50:16
In France, we use a comma.
@_date: 2013-12-07 07:55:21
There's a lady who's sure all that SHA256 is Bitcoin
And she's buying a stairway to the moon

Probably al-Qā'ida, or the Stasi.
@_date: 2013-12-27 02:52:27
I'm sure OP meant COBOL
(yes, that's a language that's very often used by banks) 
@_date: 2013-12-13 20:56:26
Same things, and others, could be said for every cultures. 
@_date: 2013-07-22 18:08:41
How is that a bad thing ?

A lot of occidental "democratic communist" ended up supporting Staline because they thought like you. 
I'd rather not make the same mistake. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 17:11:06


Avogadro disagrees

I'm pretty sure everyone is at least used to "millimeter".

Well, the difference is that military and banks are not a decentralized protocol.

I thought we were supposed to go to the moon? That's pretty hard to do in train.

Tell us, why can't an iOs app be [open-source](
@_date: 2013-04-07 15:56:56
That's not a good answer. 
Volontary "prison" are needed for bitcoin to go mainstream.
Are you running windows with UAC desactivated and no antivirus, or linux logged as root all the time?
@_date: 2013-10-27 16:35:00
"Irreversible transaction" is not the same thing as "fraud immunity".
