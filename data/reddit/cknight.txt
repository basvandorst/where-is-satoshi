NFC tags are generally passive and do not hold a charge. They are powered by the RF field generated by the reader (your NFC enabled phone for instance).

On Android, NFC has a few benefits:
 
The first is that because NFC is actively monitored by the OS (unlike the camera), you can launch an accompanying app with necessary information simply by scanning the chip. My anecdotal experience is that this is a little more streamlined than launching and app and then scanning a QR code (basically 1 step compared to 3 [launch -&gt; click scan menu item -&gt; scan]). 
The second benefit is that by using Android Application Records (AAR), which is what allows a specific app to be launched, Android will automatically load the play store page for one click install of the accompanying app if it's not already installed. This is arguably a better user experience especially for non-technical users as you can replace a series of instructions with a simple "Scan the card with your phone."

My question is more about specific, "tangible" applications that go beyond what money-in-hand can do.
For example, there's the overarching feature of being able to send money to anyone, anywhere, anytime. A simple application of that concept is our very own Bitcointip. You can therefore imagine a "killer app" being an Internet-wide tip system.
