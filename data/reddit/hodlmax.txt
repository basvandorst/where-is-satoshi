How a 'Better Bitcoin' was made:
1. You replace the reverse-polish native language of Bitcoin, by the most appropriate language for critical software security operation. This is of course: 'javascript'.
2. You remove the blocksize limit. You give the big blockers a win here.
3. You replace any concept that can help people to understand how the thing operates by buzzwords (smart copntract...).
4. You replace the UTXO model.
5. You have a team in charge that can add anything they like to the code.
After a few years, a full node of this thing can't run on a normal computer, but your answer:
1. The buzzword 'plasma' will fix the design failure. And nobody runs the software, so who cares...
2. Is this possible to bet on something so stupid?

ETH is a shitcoin, and it checks all the cases. On the economic side: the supply can be easily increased. Indeed, ETH is owned by a small team who control everything. On the software side, the coin is premined...
Faster: commit per hours is meaningless as a metric. You are just confusing marketing with reality.
Lightning is fast: This is reality.
Smartcontract: is just a buzzword for javascript.
Here is the transformation of Bitcoin into Ethereum, and how stupid this is: [

HODL 10 years and more...

The 'time' has already spoken. After 10 years, we have only one cryptocurrency that reaches the **'protocol'** level. With monetary properties that can"t be changed by anyone. With genuine antifragile qualities, resisting a takeover by Bitmain. Bitcoin faced successfully the China ban. Definitively, a protocol with a software security model protecting from state level attack.
On the other hand, we have companies (Alts). A simple phone call, can shut them down. They are fragile, and useless as money.

Ethereum is a \~30,000 BTC marketing campaign. You can't undermine the power of marketing with simple facts!

* There is more than enough materiel to explain why Ethereum is not censorship resistant.
* Ethereum is not scarce as a commodity (PlanB work).
* Ethereum can be traded. This is the only thing Ethereum is good for.

Saifedean Ammous: *"Under hard money, governments fought till they ran out of their own money. Under easy money, governments can fight until they completely consume the value of all the money held by their people. This is why the century of central banking was the century of total war."*
We are still in an Easy Money world.

Most people fail to understand Bitcoin. Bitcoin is not a magic software. A magic software that will be superseded with a magic 2.0 software. And take over with a magic 3.0 software, and so on...

We must remember that gold was confiscated:  Executive Order 6102 by Franklin D. Roosevelt. Governments can't target the Bitcoin network itself (e.g. China). But we may expect that some Government, likely the ones that are trying to control everything (e.g. Europe), will try to take some control using regulation beyond KYC/AML.

I've read somewhere: *steel is more useful than gold, so steel must have a higher valuation than gold*.
If you can't understand what Gold was in the old world, you are a perfect target for scammers in the digital age!
