I know there are a lot of creative banking products out there, especially for business. But eventually smart contracts will be layered onto bitcoin, and compete head to head with most of that.
We're going to have decentralized lending at some point. We already have blockchain lending, but it's centralized. Banks will wail loudly about how risky and dangerous it is. They will have a serious issue on their hands.
Bitshares proved you can successfully interface crypto with real world objects whilst eliminating the trust required. So crypto and specifically bitcoin is capable of jumping out of it's digital box and dealing with paper and hard issues and metrics like credit score or anything else you can imagine.

The cost of energy is going to zero. The # of hashes one can do with 1 watt of energy keeps going up too, regardless of the price / watt.
As technology marches on, the cost of clearing a bitcoin transaction in terms of electric cost is approaching zero.
The utility of sending money globally instantly for virtually free is the long term value of bitcoin, along with anonymity etc. You're looking at a side effect of the situation now and using that to define the whole phenomenon. Satoshi didn't design the mining algorithm to give bitcoin price value; he designed it to eliminate trust. Those two things are not the same thing.

He's like Clif High in the sense, nobody really knows or understands what he's talking about. But a few people pretend they do.
Nevertheless, he singularly manages to capture a large income from seminars and online sales. I would wager his income from 2017 was more than 90% from this and less than 10% actual trading. He is very careful not to call trades in advance, rather he calls them after the fact (e.g., "this is where you would have sold")

The catch 22 is, they won't adopt it until it has already been adopted.
Because, they won't adopt it until they can use it to do all their shopping. If they can shop at 99 out of 100 stores with bitcoin, they won't use it b/c that 1 store requires fiat so why bother.
Thankfully, it's not up to the average consumer to become a bitcoin believer. If the back-end of the payment system gets transformed in a  transparent way, they won't have to know or care which protocol is hauling their transactions around.

Yep. The Venezuelan government is doing this to haul in dumb money. Investing in infrastructure would be counter-productive to that goal. They are just going to go through an NEM "do your own ICO" wizard. 
They will have a web site with a hard coded bolivar / petro exchange rate and discount rate, no actual exchange. And any mining farm they have will be just for a photo op.

Not exactly. I'm saying they will do just the bare minimum they need to do, to do an exit scam ASAP after the public gets to put real money into that ICO. They will not build any infrastructure  necessary for it to be an ongoing operation. It's a one time trick, not a new system.

I'll speculate that the govt of Venezuela won't actually ever build an exchange like GDAX b/c that's hard work. There are other already-built exchanges that will list it so dummies (not governments) can throw their money away on it. Free money for maduro.
The scenario you describe would involve 2 transactions. Brazil pays for Petros in Reals. Brazil sells Petros for oil. The US govt is going to be a problem; they will see right through that and treat it just as if they spent Reals directly on the sanctioned oil. Additionally, the NEM blockchain would show that transaction. Until now all sanction cheating has been off the books. Doing it in a transparent way would give the US the evidence it needed to justify any action against any country selling petros for oil delivery. Even though maybe this allows bypassing the international monetary clearing house infrastructure, I would be surprised if any nation was brazen enough to buy sanctioned goods in broad daylight this way, thereby saying "hey US yeah we did this. What are you going to do about it?". Far easier to just carry a briefcase of Reals to Maduro's palace and have the oil trucks come to Brazil in the cover of darkness.
