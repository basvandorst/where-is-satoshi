Good to know. It'll be interesting to follow the development of this.
@_date: 2014-01-16 14:13:37
If I've misunderstood anything please let me know!

Actually, Chrome and Opera doesn't even try to resolve .bit domains when put in the address bar. They redirect to a google search instead.

And therein lies my misunderstanding! I didn't expect everyone to use them for every transaction.
However, in the way the current system works it'll be problematic for thin clients as stated below in the comments thus suggesting that not everyone will use them.
@_date: 2014-01-16 15:39:33
It wasn't meant to explain the details, just what it means in practice.
The value is included in the transaction. But only Bob knows who the transaction belongs to. Which is Bob himself.
@_date: 2014-12-23 08:22:48
Yes, don't use this in its current form.
One comment from the RNG library page:




The other comments do contain some different suggestions about libraries to use, but I don't know about them.
@_date: 2014-01-16 16:36:17
Of course, hence the "might reveal" in the image. But the same can be applied to ordinary addresses, right?
@_date: 2014-08-29 09:39:45


Not the private keys themselves but the random value used for signing, *k* here:  . This made it possible to derive the private key from the signatures if more than one transaction were made from the same address (and with the same random number).


@_date: 2014-01-17 11:27:12
Thank you for working on it. It's a very interesting idea.
@_date: 2014-01-16 16:55:51
Good, some of the responses and most of the discussion I've seen about it seems to indicate otherwise, which is unfortunate.
@_date: 2014-04-05 23:40:00
Armory can't import compressed keys, so make sure to generate one that isn't compressed.
@_date: 2014-01-16 15:46:35
I completely agree.
@_date: 2014-01-16 15:14:21
Then I have to ask what happens in the following case:
    1. Alice pays Bob 1 XBT
    2. Dave pays Bob 1 XBT
    3. Bob wants to pay a fourth party 2 XBT.
    4. Bob now _have_ to associate the previous transactions with each other.
This won't change using stealth addresses, right? As the transaction chain can't be broken you can always trace the money and thus gain information about who owns what by simply looking at combined spends like above.
As I see it, using stealth addresses is equivalent to using one address per transaction but without the payee having to generate each address. 
Still, feel free to correct me if I've missed something here.
@_date: 2014-01-16 16:34:19
But then the attack I described in the picture still works. Stealth addresses are linked just like standard addresses by the inputs and outputs of transactions. So my point still stands:


@_date: 2014-01-16 23:35:34
But it does! I suggest that you read some more about it and how it works. In particular how it breaks the chain of transactions and makes it impossible to trace the origin of the coins.
Also, they seem to have ideas to rework their previous attempts at it. See Matt Green's talk [here]( In particular, this might be relevant:

What? New Zealand is on the map.
@_date: 2014-01-16 16:38:45
Isn't it the same for normal addresses? I might have really misunderstood this but I see no difference (concerning privacy) in using stealth addresses or one-address-per-transaction addresses.
@_date: 2013-03-06 12:39:10
This. linjaaho would have to give us some more info to be able to target his addresses and "hack" them in 24 hours.

Do we really want people laughing at bitcoin? Do we really want people's first introduction to come from _Wolowitz_?
My answer is *no*.
@_date: 2013-04-10 11:10:44
After doing some quick reading, it seems that you are indeed correct. The ECDSA private key is just an integer.

You can post the password here. If someone wants to take credit they just have to sign the message with the address that received the 1 BTC, i.e. 1LxJMmxwTKDhSwckaw8LzRGtqTH7vSJACm. Then we can verify that he/she indeed solved it first :)
Like this "Signed message!" (without quotes) signed with address 1BSzXSJZzdGU85k8kQRd12cYYdnTseKa5o.

@_date: 2013-03-09 21:37:55
Looks like someone found one! What was it?
@_date: 2013-03-29 08:20:40
It's simple.
* Write a message
* Choose an address
* Click sign
To verify:
* Copy the message
* Copy the signature
* Copy the address
* Click verify
Here's an example, this text is signed using **1HP72WPaz6uyqGmpVKH4ivrUoGByym5qVi**


Signature: **H3WJl7V6hdstqNAV8mD0GL6PIYX+QZn192s+e/3srh82W6ic6YfTkJcdxBmjSThKD6ICwd+x9WIRyDvwi/J8dQc=**
You should see a green message saying **Message Verified**

Here's a small script that does all of this: 
Remember that you must remember how many rounds you use!
@_date: 2013-04-10 10:39:57
This feels wrong. You still have to generate the ECDSA private key, right?
What am I missing?

Lol, "Twittsdaq dollar (T$)". From the first in that list 
@_date: 2013-04-09 11:10:19
Anything _greater_ than 1BTC is small? Or were you trying to write &lt;1BTC?
If you're worried about hacks then a local wallet is the best choice (with the proper security precautions). After that I'd say the hybrid wallet that blockchain uses. The place _not_ to keep bitcoins in is the exchange.
@_date: 2013-07-14 21:46:19
Actually, the same applies to hash functions. Take SHA-2 as an example (which in its 256 bit form is used in bitcoin). SHA-2 with an reduced number of rounds is broken, in theory. Some cryptoanalyst might have an 'eureka' moment and break SHA-2 in much the same way that someone might solve the problem of protein folding. It is unlikely, but it can happen. You make a good point, but to say that SHA-2 is provably hard is a bit of a stretch.

Yes, of course. This was simply a response to OP's erroneous calculation.

It's still too hard to guess your specific passwords.
You need to be more specific in your hints. We have no idea what kind of phrases you'd use. (In particular the Finnish ones) 
Still a nice experiment though!

Then they start appearing when you describe the situation to others.
+5 millibit verify
@_date: 2013-07-12 06:59:04
I might have misunderstood this but it has a clock rate at 152MHz and it requires 2*66 cycles to complete a double SHA-256.
So, wouldn't the hashrate be 152 MHz / (2 * 66) cycles = 1.15 Mh/s?
@_date: 2013-03-10 10:34:07
So, what was the second one? 
EDIT: And the third?
@_date: 2013-04-17 16:47:02
Because the ordinary way to do transactions is not the only way.
One could for example require two keys to sign the transaction, require one out of two keys or just make the coins available to the first one who spends them.
Here's an example of spending coins not associated with an address:

If the wallet or the entire drive is encrypted you have to be logged in. Otherwise one could just boot with a USB-stick and grab the file off the hard drive.
That's one of the reasons that you should encrypt the wallet!

So what's stopping me from generating a new vote, then another and another...
As previously stated, a blockchain might not be the right tool here. There is however a lot of room for improvement regarding voting.
