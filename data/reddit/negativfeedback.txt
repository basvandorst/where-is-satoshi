My cash is depreciating in value every day. What's the point of adding 4k to my savings so it can depreciate alongside it?

You're confused. You can mock the propaganda that fiat will be abandoned or will implode and become useless, but you can't ignore the real fact that all money is susceptible to inflation on a daily basis.

I gave off the wrong impression. I don't need the 8k for day-to-day living, I just need it for my investment budget. I had a plan to pay off my 300k+ student loans within 5 years, but that's definitely not happening if I'm giving up every time I take a $4k loss.

My overall investment is down $4k. The fact that I made a profit in November is irrelevant since I never cashed out. The entire portfolio tanked in the past three weeks.

I've been buying in pieces since September. But my losses weren't only in BTC. I had a lot invested in NXT and that crashed hard in December. I don't need the money right now, but I definitely will need it this year, and if I put everything back into BTC, the only way I make my $4k back is if BTC hits 20k. So while everyone else is celebrating doubling or tripling their investments, I'm just breaking even.

Sure, but there's a non-zero chance I make the 4k back if I hold.

No, I just moved a majority of my BTC to NXT which tanked something like 700%. In theory, I'm receiving IGNIS tokens in exchange for the drop, but I had my NXT on Bittrex and I still haven't gotten anything.

Between September and December, but yes, my last investment was $500 last month.

I can't take the loss.

Last year I invested $8k in BTC and other crypto, and it's now all worth $4k. My fiancee is gonna kill me.

They did get caught tho

I bought 40 NXT coins for shits and giggles at 0.0003 BTC, now it's at 0.0009 BTC so I regret not buying more. Just bought 400 NXT, so let's see how it goes.

It's a dip, hardly a crash. It's already at 10700 and going up.

What exactly do you envision 1 billion for that can't be done with 100 million? She doesn't have to cash it all out, and it really doesn't matter if the pile goes down in value eventually so long as she's cashed out enough to live a full and luxurious life.

You don't need to sell it all at once. Why would you? BTC keeps going up. She just needs to catch out as much as she needs and keep the rest as savings.
