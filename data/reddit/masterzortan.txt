I wasn’t joking.  So a guy made a typo 6 years ago and people continue to make the same typo in tribute or something?  That’s dumb.

They spelled “holder” wrong.

I’m at 0.  No way in Hell I’m throwing good money after something that won’t exist in 10 years.
@_date: 2019-10-27 16:14:09
Why didn’t they call it SkyNet?

Most likely bitcoin won’t exist much longer than 5 more years.  It’s not sustainable at all.
@_date: 2019-12-08 22:05:20
I agree with Buffett and how many idiots holding it doesn’t mean jack when it ceases to exist.
@_date: 2019-12-04 00:48:09
No it’s the right place to inform all you wackos that you’re wasting time and money on a fakery, buddy.
@_date: 2019-12-06 01:49:03
Definitely the truck.  A real asset over some fake crap.
@_date: 2019-12-17 00:06:26
Haha.  Whatever moron.  I’d also bet I’m 10 times smarter than you.
@_date: 2019-12-17 00:21:38
Well I am and I did.  Now run along little boy.  I’m done with you.
@_date: 2019-12-06 03:47:22
Bitcoin won’t exist in a couple of decades.
@_date: 2019-12-16 20:38:54
Oh I can tell you how computers work.  That has nothing to do with this site or this app however.  Nice try at a smart ass comment that fell flat.
@_date: 2019-12-16 20:15:15
I didn’t know I was subscribed to it.  I never subscribed.  I’ll look into that.  Thanks.
@_date: 2019-12-06 03:32:21
Absolutely not.  I’d put it in something safer, like penny stocks.
@_date: 2019-12-03 08:12:35
SomeONE programmed it and someONE else could change that programming.  Ever heard of hacking?  Not everyONE is ethical and follows the established rules.  Anything that’s just a bunch of computer code can be changed and I wouldn’t want to base a currency on that.  It won’t be around much longer.
@_date: 2019-12-16 23:33:12
Kid?  Haha.  I’d bet I’m older than you, snowflake.
@_date: 2019-12-03 02:27:56
 Bitcoin is a fake currency floating around in a digital cloud.  Why would it be limited?  Someone could change that anytime.  It will never be viable and will probably be nonexistent in 10 years.
@_date: 2019-12-16 20:01:28
Because this garbage keeps showing up on my feed and you acolytes keep pushing this crap.
@_date: 2019-12-09 00:34:42
Bitcoin itself is a scam.
@_date: 2019-09-02 14:30:57
But it is most certainly not a fact.  It’s an opinion and a bad one at that.
@_date: 2019-09-02 14:27:39
Then why did you post such an inflammatory thing?  Maybe you should have kept that to yourself if you didn’t want to argue it.
@_date: 2019-09-02 14:34:34
I thought you didn’t want to argue it.  Haha.  You’re way past the point where any evidence I send would do you any good.  I am really done with this discussion so you have a nice day.
