Even the last thing you said is only true if you have enough to turn any real profits or want to invest, some people just want to make a quick buck. I also had a lot of bitcoin around that time, I don't dabble anymore but like you said the things that really matter in life make no difference depending on your wealth, if anything it makes it more complicated to be wealthy, obviously you need an adequate wage but that's it, how you choose to live your life is happiness.
I have had a bad few years myself gambling heavily, upswings in fortune to the point where I was making more money most months than friends in high paying jobs got in a year ust by playing online slots...then the greed takes over and your wasting thousands a day for a few months never cashing out.
Now I'm back on a good path, taken up an extra job so I can earn a decent wage, have a lovely partner who I'm going to move countries for when I have saved enough, I'm happy for the first time in ages. Recently had a holiday with her, didn't get to do anything fancy, travelling around Italy, she's a PhD student and I was just poor but I know I was having a better time and better memories than the rich people I passed eating in a restaurant where they paid 200 euros for a plate of food whilst looking at each other with contempt. One month when gambling I was up over £100,000...that's a fuck lot of money for gambling, didn't make me happy though or get any use.
You can always regret things in life but ultimately live one day at a time, one moment at a time. You need to accept hardships sometimes, and you can always move forwards if you don't look back, who knows what awaits you. One of the truly happiest men I know is a fairly religious guy (Muslim) who only owns a bicycle and lives in a small house but he is only ever positive and encouraging of everyone around him. My ex fiancee was from a really wealthy family, no real love there and I woke up one day at her parents house to find the remnants of her brothers suicide attempt, a broken belt from the stairs, blood all over the walls. Money certainly buys security, not happiness.

Its been happening SEVERAL times a month now for the past 3-4 months,  I dont know why everyone acts surprised when it happens, get up around about the $4,000 make then drops, has a few hiccups, drops again, rises, drops rises blah blah blah.
@_date: 2019-02-09 01:43:44
Do people not realise its been much higher several times in the past few months since that big drop, and fell each time it went back up.

No there really isnt, apart from illegal stuff, any other use for bitcoin is just a pain in the ass big time, to the point where you cant buy what you want or it takes days to jump through hoops.
I remember how annoying it was buying BTC in like 2011, a serious struggle in the UK....its barely changed.
@_date: 2019-01-28 05:02:23
The positive news on here is just cringe, bitcoins been in a downward spiral for the best part of a year and no new technology is changing it.
@_date: 2019-01-28 06:13:03
For a month now?
@_date: 2019-01-10 23:02:15
Bitcoins worse, it's make believe money
@_date: 2019-01-26 12:24:03
stop living in a fantasy
@_date: 2019-01-14 00:40:34
Its been at that recently for a month and gone back up, who knows what happens.
@_date: 2019-01-10 08:53:42
The same things happened about 20 times + the last 3 weeks?
@_date: 2019-01-25 08:11:52
Dont talk about shit you dont understand, oh look I read an article on bitcoin, GOLD IS FOR SCHMUCKS AND DOLLARS ARE FAKE MONEY.

I use cex.io, I can withdraw to my card next day and it was fairly simple to setup....not promoting them or anything its just one of the few I found for UK guys that didnt have restrictions or issues (most do in UK).
@_date: 2019-01-23 23:47:09
Lol why the fuck would you expect that?
@_date: 2019-01-28 06:12:32
Yeah of course you do
@_date: 2018-12-25 01:00:24
Back to what it was 2 days ago lol, not a huge issue.
@_date: 2018-12-28 15:49:53
I think so, its now back to what its been roughly at for the past week ish so that would make sense....hopefully it rises a bit more though to get some encouragement back for backers.

It literally happened 2 days ago, I live in Jakarta so I sleep when the Americans play but I went to sleep on Saturday it was at 3800 dollars after dropping from about 4000, then when I woke up it was back at like 4100, it will rise again the next few hours.
@_date: 2018-12-19 01:42:29
yay...back to what it was 10 days ago ha, was about to buy some more to a few days ago, not that I have much but every little helps!
@_date: 2018-12-25 01:00:39
It was lower than this 2 days ago, its fine.
@_date: 2018-12-26 02:20:56
Well...back in like 2011/2012 when it was really cheap I tried to buy stuff on silkroad and a few other places but just couldnt get any BTC, it was a pain in ass in the UK to get it to work alot of the time without doing bank transfers and waiting 5 days etc etc and with uncertainty. Nowadays I can just deposit and withdraw with my debit card and ive seen some shops all over the world accepting bitcoin..its NO WAY near mainstream but its made massive improvements in the past 5 years.

I sold most of what I had the other day when they were at about $4000, to much volatility for me at the moment and I really dont see an upwards trend happening, the only signs are stability/downwards spiral, I will happily lose a potential 20-30% profit over what I took than lose an actual 20-30% of what I have.
