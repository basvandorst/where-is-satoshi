If I may ask, did he specifically tell you that that is not a taxable event? I was under the impression that cashing out is taxable, and so is spending. If spending is not taxed, then I will never sell and just use for purchases.

Unless you went through localbitcoins.com, you have to put your information out there to get the Bitcoins. At an ATM  you need your ID, phone number, etc to receive. For Coinbase, you need your ID, etc. They can follow where those coins go.
@_date: 2017-12-03 03:21:24


How is Bitcoin Cash fully centralized? (I say Bitcoin Cash just because I'm still learning and I don't want to take sides so I'm respecting both names of which they want to be called).
Do you mean because the less nodes there are the less people who make decisions on things like hard forks? Also am I right here, Is that true?
But to that point, according to Moore's law the amount of memory available increases exponentially so I don't see how that would be a problem.
@_date: 2017-12-02 16:42:04
Since it is a fork, and people disagree on it, what is the procedure for knowing which one should be called Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-17 17:41:51
Minus short-term gain taxes that's more of a 50% gain than a 100%. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 18:53:51
I wouldn't beat myself up over which (which actually it seems like you're not doing), if you are like the vast majority of people you would have sold a significant amount after it reached certain all time highs.
@_date: 2017-12-02 16:33:34
Can someone explain the vitriol for Bitcoin Cash here? As it seems the difference it Bitcoin Cash let's blocks get bigger which takes more space on a computer to run a full node.
However, we all don't need to be running full nodes, and according to Moore's law it should be fine because memory doubles every two years. 
Bitcoin cash fees are very cheap, while Bitcoin fees are very expensive.
Am I missing something here?
@_date: 2017-12-18 04:47:27
So short term gains on trading are different than short term gains on selling to fiat? I was told they are treated the same.
Also income tax in the US can be close to 50% depending on your income.

Guys, I think this should be pinned at the top of this communities posts.
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:34:04
Did he comment on that since the bankruptcy?
@_date: 2017-12-03 03:52:24
Thanks. The very last comment is the most important one I think, so if you read anything please read that.


Your comment shows how polarizing and political this issue has got lol. I'm not a programmer etc. I am going off of information that I have read/been told. If it's wrong I'm willing to change my mind. 


Why wouldn't they want it given the cheaper price, and (seemingly) facts that running a fuller node is not an issue according to Moore's law?
(As for the running less nodes.)
I still don't understand how they would be running less nodes to a degree that would make any difference if according to Moore's law memory will exponentially grow (as it has been).
Is it possible that a company or country could run so many full nodes that they soft/hard fork and change everyones coincs?


Also once Bitcoin gets to a certain degree of popularity the number of transactions won't increase anymore.
Personally, I don't see how spending 8 dollars per transaction is worth that.


As far as I know you can use Bitcoin without running a full node, correct?


Very good point. But considering the fees for Bitcoin as it is now with Segwit, won't they have to hard fork again in order to lower the fees?

@_date: 2017-12-03 05:31:30
OK so seems we are stuck on the numbers then. You are saying that while because of Moore's law, the memory for running a full node wouldn't be an issue. However that because internet speeds only go up 50% each year (which because Moore's law states every 2 years memory space goes up 100%, it's the exact same)


Here is what you said in relation to my above post.
Now that Nielson's law and Moore's law are the same. Every 2 years it doubles. But only High End Users can do that. 
If Fiber becomes a thing and it's not limited to High End Users, then would you be on board? (Also, almost no one is running a full node on Bitcoin now as it is anyway. Probably only the High End Users who are so into computers they have the means to do so because they're on top of computer stuff)
Are you saying if everyone starts running Segwit that the fees would be as low as Bitcoin Cash because of Lightning Network as well?
@_date: 2017-12-03 03:05:15


But it can handle the vast majority right? 


Couldn't they increase the size exponentially? Like if the use goes up couldn't they hard fork it from 8mb to 24mb, etc until it plateaus?
@_date: 2017-12-02 17:19:59
I haven't heard of companies making money nefariously from bch. Do you have any example of this, I'm interested. 
I don't see how Segwit helps much with scaling. It reduces block size which makes it easier to run a full node. But running a full node is not necessary for most people, and memory for companies goes up exponentially so as it looks to me the bigger blocks aren't much of an issue. 
Thanks for commenting btw (I'm not one way or the other, just want to know the truth)
@_date: 2018-09-03 03:48:42
What does that mean in laymen terms, that bitcoin will drop? thanks!
@_date: 2017-12-03 04:51:44


I thought I did. Even if internet speeds only go up 50%, does that really make much of a difference? Especially with Fiber coming up that doesn't seem like an issue.
I still don't understand how these things are worth the $10 fees, etc. 


But I'd rather not run a full node and pay less money. I don't see why the juice is worth the squeeze I guess.


So once everyone uses Segwit, the fees will be the same as Bitcoin Cash?

Sorry can you say the last paragraph more simply. Is your point paying taxes on individual purchases at all is just dumb and we shoildnt do it because its too cumbersome?
@_date: 2017-12-02 16:39:46
I think they should call it Bitcoin Segwit and Bitcoin Cash. May I ask why do you support Bitcoin Segwit over Bitcoin Cash given the fee differences? I understand the nodes are smaller but how is that a good trade off?
@_date: 2017-12-03 02:46:39
Correct me if I'm wrong but Bitcoin Cash allows for the blocks to get as big as they need to be allowing for everyone to have their transaction completed.
@_date: 2017-12-05 04:51:35
If i were you i would diversify into other coins with 30 percent, and cash out about 35 percent amd rest leave it. The chances that either alt coins or btc will take off is very low imo
@_date: 2017-12-02 16:36:00
Why do you think Bitcoin is better, I'm sincerely curious. I know there is a lot of political-like feelings going either way. But Bitcoin Segwit has smaller blocks, while Bitcoin Cash has bigger blocks. However not everyone has to run a full node to use Bitcoin and memory doubles every 2 years so it shouldn't be a problem. It seems like the smaller blocks don't make up for the fees for Bitcoin Segwit.
@_date: 2017-12-18 12:32:18
@_date: 2017-12-02 16:45:43
Why do you think Segwit's version of Bitcoin should be called just Bitcoin when there was a fork which split them into two?
@_date: 2017-12-23 11:21:22
And pay 32 dollars in fees :x
@_date: 2018-08-25 17:12:56
I wonder what that's based on though. As the Canadian guy here said you have wait sometimes 6 months for simple things like an MRI, etc. or a while for even a broken ankle. 
@_date: 2018-08-25 15:46:53
I've always wondered, is that actually true? I mean, I've heard waiting for treatment can be bad and people come to the US for better health care but I wonder about it. Also is it worth the burdens that people are put through in the US? And the lack of preventative care people wait because of lack of funds/insurance?
@_date: 2018-05-20 00:26:40
A string of words say to follow chronologically, so this could be there is some relation to the numbers next to the word. And when I saw z equals a lot I thought it could be a Z score. The higher the Z score the lower the Y value so that could mean the order is backwards.
@_date: 2018-08-25 16:05:56
Here, afaik, everyone can be looked after. There are programs like Medicare/Medicaid. And worst case, if it's an emergency or you break an ankle for example you can go to the ER and they always have to take you by law. The only thing is the bill is expensive. But when it comes to not paying it back, they can't put a lean on your house if it's the only one, etc. Just it can affect your credit score.
For me personally, when I had to go to the ER I just never payed. It was too rediculous. So it's not like they let people die in the streets or anything like that afaik.

you have to track all purchases, and match the sales against the appropriate purchase / purchases (FIFO or LIFO, but once you pick a system, you can't change it.)

Oh my gosh.
Excuse my ignorance. But are you saying, some people write that 12 letter phrase word on a piece of paper, and delete their wallet. Then they want to send someone bitcoin so they download a new wallet and send it, then delete that wallet expecting the rest of that bitcoin to go back into the same 12 letter phrase wallet they have that's on the paper?
So every time you send BTC it sends the whole thing but just send the remaining amount back to yourself in a new address?
Thanks a lot

But if the losing side has say 10BTC, you can still each get 5BTC? Is it because something like it affects the odds so it makes it so that all the BTC gets taken?
OK, let's say, there Jim and Tim bets .01 for the Bulls to win, and Paul bets 10BTC for the Nets to win. 
Now does this mean Jim and Tim can take down 5BTC each if they win, and Paul can only take down .01 if he wins?
I have been betting like .01 BTC where "in bank" says .003 a lot of the time... that's going to mean I will lose a lot?

Isn't that true any time any type of currency is on an exchange? I guess in particular Bitcoin because there's no going back.
Are you saying that if the SEC approved it as currency that so many people would get into it not knowing how it really works and blindly trust exchanges and put their Bitcoin on servers which are risky?
Or are you saying something else? Thank you!

What programming language was used to create things like wallet or blockchains?

How can you put info into a block chain? And how can people see it in the block chain. There's also so many blocks wouldn't that info get buried not to mention people wouldn't know how to access it.
@_date: 2017-03-25 09:36:46
Why? honest question
@_date: 2017-03-25 14:26:17
The more people that use Bitcoin the higher the conversion rate to fiat will be. This will naturally invite speculation.
People speculate on fiat as well. They can put their money in yen and hope the yen rises and then change back to the dollar etc. Fiat can fluctuate a lot.

When is the ETF announcement?
@_date: 2017-03-29 13:32:35
Hi thanks for your detailed post. "putting Bitcoin into an ETF doesn't change the properties of Bitcoin - it's the same Bitcoin" here you said this and that's what I thought. But I think Andreas was saying the opposite, that the ETF could change the rules and people could lose millions of Bitcoin. (Maybe I misinterpreted that which is very likely)
But if that is what he was saying, how would that be possible? By the ETF having so many Bitcoins they have a larger say in what happens to them?
Thank you!

I am watching the Bitcoin lessons from Coursera. They explain SHA-256 and show script, so I guess that would mean that is all in C++? And that the C++ script he is referring to is embedded in alt-coin/Bitcoin wallets?
Lightning version means fast version?
I am spending a lot of time trying to understand this, and I'm accumulating information little by little as I go but so much goes over my head that I feel there must be a more efficient way. Like I am not understanding a lot of the terms he's using about programming. I'm wondering if I should start there?
Thank you so much!!!!!

Thank you for your explanation!

Nothing is bullet proof, all anyone is saying is that the thing that bitcoin offers is a revolutionary secure and fast way to transfer value. 
Whether it becomes huge or not this fact remains.

@_date: 2017-03-10 13:02:16
Right, I guess like what are the chances that a person can successfully double spend before the last confirmation?

Thanks. Actually since you mention it I have another question. I keep hearing people talk about tickets (about decred coin) and tokens (about other coins), are these the same thing just used by miners to vote on something?

Oh so it doesn't have to be the same wallet? So writing down the seed on paper and hiding it is the best bet? But keeping it on a wallet offline is the 2nd best?

I've thought about this. I think there's 2 possibilities.
1. Whales and big holders fluctuate the market in a way that make novice investors like us think it's a good time to buy when it's not.
2. We remember the times it goes down more than the times we buy and it goes up.
I'm more inclined to believe 2.

@_date: 2017-11-10 15:47:23
What is substantial? Have you considered diversifying into other coins to make sure you don't lose your hat? Everybody believes blockchain will be successful but Bitcoin is going through a lot of scaling issues and it's not a sure thing it will be the big winner.

The reason is because bitcoin paper wallets have a private number on them so anybody in the chain of giving and receiving the note can have access to the money and then the note would be worthless or at least it would not be worth any bitcoin like the note promises

Right, I'm sure people will report it but Bitcoin seems easy to be able to false report and not get caught.

I am beside myself with irritation at myself. I feel so retarded. I tried to research the easiest fool-proof way to have a wallet so I don't lose more coins than I already did. I lost 40 dollars worth of Ripple on Gatehub, something like 20 dollars on I think it's like Nano wallet or something. 
Anyway, thank you for your help, and sorry I'm just letting off steam right now.

"Absolute zero temperatures" Are you saying that something about running a computer at absolute zero temperature (which up until now has been impossible because there is always some heat etc) somehow allows for extremely fast (able to break sha256 cryptography) computing power?
Or did you mean absolute zero as another meaning?
As nube as my question is your explanation helps a lot, thank you.

@_date: 2018-02-11 07:40:39
That’s because they can regulate currency. People actually get their money taken for having too much. If you have heard of civil forfiture, the police confiscate the money and charge the money itself with a crime and not the actual person. It’s pretty fucked up.
@_date: 2017-10-22 14:39:51
It's hard to remember but I would say it took about 3-5 days to get the card and then another 3-5 days for the confirmation to change. Wish I could remember exact days for ya..
@_date: 2017-09-15 12:44:58
Hey, thanks.
When you got the Post in the mail, how long until it verified? As far as I can tell just receiving it and signing for it should activate it. No?
Edit: If you can't end up getting your Bank account verified can you still withdrawal BTC? Thanks
@_date: 2017-09-15 13:05:17
Hey, I'm trying it out. Do you use it?
@_date: 2017-09-15 12:58:07
Ya I agree. I live in Kansai and they recently took the last ATM out of my area, bastards. 
Glad to hear that though because I already have coins on there now and was worried I may not get them back.
Thanks a lot!
@_date: 2017-09-17 23:52:15
Ya getting money on there can either be done by..
1. Setting up your credit or debit card on the site (which seems difficult for foreigners because of issues with address or name)
2. Bank furikomi (I did this, it takes about a day and withdrawal of bitcoin takes longer)
3. Quick deposit (I also did this, I recommend it. It's by Konbini. If you can't figure out how to do it by Konbini when I get home I can look, I can't remember the exact names of everything without looking at my computer)
However for me, I'm still waiting on confirmation of my postal mail which i received but it still hasn't verified yet. How long did it take yours to verify?

I read that comment as they were praising them not being skeptical. Maybe I misunderstood something along the way??

Dam u just killed my dreams of becoming a millionaire.

How would devaluing the dollar make it easier to pay? Wouldnt that mean you have to pay more? Also why would China hate it if its easier for them to be paid? Sorry for my nube question.

From my interpretation of mens rea, it sounds contradictory to what i have heard forever that, "ignorance is not an excuse for breaking the law".
Is it that the onus is on you to prove you didnt know? But then how would that work?
@_date: 2017-09-15 13:16:06
Processing. Thank you!

Hey, thanks.
When you got the Post in the mail, how long until it verified? As far as I can tell just receiving it and signing for it should activate it. No?
Edit: If you can't end up getting your Bank account verified can you still withdrawal BTC? Thanks

Doesn't skyhook cost like 1k and even I think its like genesis or oen of them costs like 3k and it is a nice one.

What happens on the 30th?

This is true, same for browsers I believe, when I accidentaly typed in the wrong MEW address it came up with a warning that it's blcoked.

Ya I agree. I live in Kansai and they recently took the last ATM out of my area, bastards. 
Glad to hear that though because I already have coins on there now and was worried I may not get them back.
Thanks a lot!

I live in Japan. Really? Does Ebay have a good reputation for making sure the funds go to agreed upon address? 
Also what mark-up do you charge?, Thanks!
@_date: 2017-09-15 13:19:04
Nice moves, hehe. Thanks again!

There is some serious lockness monster action going on right now on the coinmarket charts
@_date: 2017-09-15 13:04:55
Thanks is this the website? 
Is there a lot of time before you can buy or set up your bank account? 
@_date: 2017-10-26 10:19:08
I remember thinking I must have to, because how would they know. But there was no identification number on mine, and I am almost 100% sure I didn't.
@_date: 2017-05-13 10:21:17
How would they know to patch them and where to get a patch? You mean like Norton anti virus or something? 
@_date: 2017-05-27 06:24:47
Ahem.. this was incorrect but I applaud your optimism. To the stars!

I used to have a lot of Doge and lost some money on it. i liked donating to the bobsled team etc, and the donation culture it had but I don't really see much promise in it these days. Am I wrong?
@_date: 2017-05-13 16:38:37
Unfortunately, no lol 
@_date: 2017-07-17 13:03:40
When is the split?
@_date: 2017-07-17 05:38:47
That's good for you. For me, I sold all my Bitcoin. And by sold I mean didn't sell.
@_date: 2017-07-16 16:14:47
What makes you think it will go that low?
@_date: 2017-07-16 16:14:33
What makes you think it won't go any lower?
@_date: 2017-06-20 12:01:47
Do you have transfer addresses and dates and tx ID's? 
@_date: 2017-06-12 14:23:21
haha.. you've come to the end of your rope. Hopefully the market can withstand you dumping your BTC load onto it.
@_date: 2018-12-05 09:05:43
Personally because we’re in the early stages I’m more afraid of malicious attacks than something like that. The chances mistyping any amount of letters would end in a valid address is astronomically low. Your tx would just be rejected.

Do you mean a default ruleset in JTR can crack anyone's password 24% of the time? Or only when they have a good idea of what the password might be like in OP's case?
@_date: 2017-06-20 10:55:11
Does this mean like an agreement of a bunch of transactions that all are put into one and put on the blockchain for one 2-3 dollar cost and this split amongst all the payers?
@_date: 2017-06-08 09:45:05
This hurts to look at, but it makes me feel much better about my much smaller purchases.
