Ah I’m pretty sure I setup with Segwit because I have the option to send Segwit transactions. Thanks!
@_date: 2018-01-23 07:19:56
Are Ledger Nano S wallets segwit addresses?

Sounds like you've been watching too much Andreas Antonopolous :3

Weak hands. Weak hands everywhere. Good for the hodlers because we can accumulate more Bitcoin :)
@_date: 2018-02-02 07:07:56
Same here. Bought from 22k all the way down to 10k AUD. Deposited another $2k into BTCMarkets but theyre taking their sweet ass time with BPAY.

Apparently he had the discipline to use Tor in every online interaction. This guy is a pro.

First google search says the address which mined the Genesis block holds 980,000 Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-02-01 23:58:32
Because I believe that Bitcoin has a bright future ahead. Because I am against the idea of central reserve banking whereby inflation is a hidden tax on citizens. Because I watch too much Andreas Antonopolous.

Greedy they are.

It has natural deflationary properties. Bitcoin is awesome lol.

I've always wondered how withdrawing fiat from a Bitcoin atm works. Do you transfer to some address then wait for confirmation?
I'd imagine if that's the case:
- Best case: 0-10 minute wait
- Otherwise: 10+ minute wait
