He defnintely did! Apparently, he did invest in some crypto but pulled out when he realised he needed to do more research. I'm not disrespecting him! Telling stupid people no is how he made his riches :)

I agree. Hindsight is 20/20. That's why I thought this was so funny. I'm not shitting on him though, it was a valuable lesson for me :) I just wanted to show how ridiculous these conversations sounded for what Bitcoin is now.

Well, pretty much all of it. He's delegated bills to me now but they all pretty much equal what I make. It's fine because I don't really have impulses to buy stuff and whenever I need to go meet a client or take a client out to dinner he "loans" me the money. He never takes the loans back :p
He's paying for my college so I see this as a great deal

I'm gonna go ahead and remove this post now. I feel like I couldn't convey what I actually wanted and it came across the wrong way :) thanks everyone for making me realise that what I was saying sounded different and light hearted in my mind but in reality it sounded bratty.

Yep! I believe that too now. When he told me to get a job I was really upset. After a year of hard work that money was really valuabke to me. I just wished he had let me keep it and do my thing with it. I did say that I work in my post , it's just that he wanted his fair share. His fair share was all of it and rightly so.
