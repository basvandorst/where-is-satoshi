Is that the one here in Washington?

You must be new here....

 also accepts BTC and often has very good prices (although not always).
The way they do it is kind of backwards though, you send the BTC and it shows up as store credit then you make your purchase using store credit.  I used it to pickup BF4 Premium and the whole process took a little over an hour.  Most of the time was waiting for the BTC transaction to clear and the credit to show up on my account.
The site has been around a long time, long before they started accepting BTC, and is legit.

Nice to see another Netlimiter user.  I've been using it since 1.3 and love it

I'm not even sure I can give you 3 a day unless "I guess I didn't die" can count every day....even though I'm not always sure its a positive thing.

Those are awesome

That's really cool and being I'm just outside Seattle I would love to give this thing a try but I am just not comfortable with the whole "palm print" thing
@_date: 2016-03-26 18:45:42
But...why?  You could use a CMYK spot color and achieve nearly the same look with only 4 or 5 screens.  I guess if you're using the same setup as in last years pictures that would probably be the reasoning.
If you're still using that homemade setup I'd strongly recommend getting an actual press from M&amp;R or similar.   You could also [build one]( to save on costs.
Edit: I read through more of the thread and saw the new posters update pictures.  It looks great, registration is on lock but man you're spending so much extra time that is just unnecessary.

Thats fair enough, I just had a hard time imagining doing that much work for so few prints but I can see it from your point of view.
 Thanks for the reply

I would argue the long term people here know how it goes and know that it's nothing to get crazy excited about yet.

Nice rhyme

I feel like I hear this every year
@_date: 2015-03-23 01:06:56
I meant if you're trying to use this as a way to get more people involved with bitcoin having them ready to go would help

I would personally prefer they have a paper wallet they can just hand me.  I dunno about your store but mine gets busy nearly every day and I want to get back to the store (to get another delivery) asap.

And not even a black edition.  So lame

I really wanna try that fucking burger.  I hear its the best in town
