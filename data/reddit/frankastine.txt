how do you differentiate between retail investors and institutional investors? 
@_date: 2018-05-26 16:40:43

@_date: 2018-05-26 10:13:34

Advice is good, Bitcoin is going to be more useful soon, US gov has hearing on 18th july to understand the use of cryptocurrencies in gov and in the form of money... so i recommend buy BTC,
But not sure about you should buy Litecoin or not.

Zebpay also sends the similar email
RBI has recently issued communication about discontinuation of services by RBI regulated entities (banks/payment gateways) for purchase and sale of Bitcoin and other virtual currencies. 
We remain committed to keeping customer funds and assets secure, and are exploring various options. However, sudden disruption in banking services could affect our ability to service deposits and withdrawals, until banking services are restored. 
Please keep this risk factor in mind while making your investment decisions.
