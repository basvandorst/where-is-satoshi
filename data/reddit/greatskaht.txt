Ignoring the trust associated with random number generators, don't begin to trust Javascript wallets that you can't check and contrast results against other wallet key generator software. I used the libbitcoin bitcoin-explorer (bx)  command line interface as a the gold standard to contrast results from different Javascript wallets before I started assigning any degree of loose trust to any Javascript HD, or BIP 38 wallet implementations. I did run into a few buggy or Trojan Javascript paper wallet generators during my investigations, even for a an early Ethereum Javascript wallet.

Stealth addresses are still around and are being supported, but not directly by all of the ~half dozen Bitcoin frameworks (e.g., ** *bitcoin* | *libbitcoin* | *btcsuite* | *bitpay* | *bitcoinj* | *spesmilo*] written in various programming languages.  Stealth transactions protect the privacy of transaction recipients while mixing protects the privacy of transaction senders. It is worth noting that a Bitcoin stealth payment effectively requires 2 transactions on "the Blockchain" to complete a handshake so the recipient can later spend the stealth transaction funds sent.  This requires the recipient's wallet to *scan* the Blockchain which is computationally time consuming. See [Stealth Address]( to quickly learn more.  
Speaking unofficially on the behalf of the libbitcoin effort, framework support for stealth addresses is still alive in v3.0. It is however, a whole different matter for wallets to utilize frameworks that support stealth transactions. 
On the client side, the bitcoin-explorer (**bx**) command line interface is production ready (but not not for stealth address multisig support) see the image at  for framework support. 
The libbitcoin server v3.0 ( is being refactored by Eric V. has taken shape, and is approaching completion for an official release. This new server indexes **all** spends, addresses and stealth payments in a in an operating system's memory-mapped file system - is definitely cutting edge work.

You are correct. No protocol change to the wallet, but note that stealth addresses are never posted on a blockchain, see

The morale of this story for others reading is to always perform roundtrip testing of BIP 38 implementations. Different BIP 38 implementations provide different answers. 
Here is something quick (4 steps) that can be tried using [**bitcoin-explorer**]( albeit 5 steps are provided below for completeness.  A few years ago the bx command was extended the BIP 38 standard to accommodate altcoins besides just Bitcoin, altcoins have prefixes other than 6P.
**1. Convert a base58check encoded Wallet Input Format (**WIF**) private secp256k1 key to a hexadecimal formatted private key.**
% bx base58check-decode 5Ka1Bv4RpKayZygPhZbBcREejqeYwq2iSRzWPKsg49SPgVRTnpW
    checksum 3879764322
    payload e6f634276585c1b25e90fc396ef9793e1ac311dbb4f823c93f94f71d53442dc3
    version 128
**2. Convert the hexadecimal elliptic curve private key to an BIP 38 encrypted key.**  The version is set to 0 for Bitcoin.
% bx ec-to-ek -v 0 "testingOneTwo" e6f634276585c1b25e90fc396ef9793e1ac311dbb4f823c93f94f71d53442dc3
**3.  Decode the BIP 38 encrypted private key.**
% bx ek-to-ec "testingOneTwo" 
**4. Convert the Bitcoin hexadecimal encoded private key to WIF.**
 
% bx base58check-encode -v 128 e6f634276585c1b25e90fc396ef9793e1ac311dbb4f823c93f94f71d53442dc3
**5. Compute associated public address from private hexadecimal key.**
% echo e6f634276585c1b25e90fc396ef9793e1ac311dbb4f823c93f94f71d53442dc3 | bx ec-to-public -u | bx ec-to-address -v 0
Look at the results below from the [**BitcoinPaperWallet**]( implementation that I have from a few years back. This implementation supports roundtrip testing for arbitrary WIF-encoded private keys. However, extreme care has to be exercised to ensure the interface is being used properly.
Notice that the BIP 38 encryption results appear to be different, but look at the results when **bx** is used to decrypt the BIP 38 BitcoinPaperWallet. This is the same private key!!!
% bx ek-to-ec "testingOneTwo" 6PRLKpRdHRsMJcjuMYoE4wpKYUZEX11oB9LejdU8JuDLxynpDZFZWMNkDv
 
% bx ek-to-ec "testingOneTwo" 6PYMN8WT4CW7xLYczLvYfXZCtQWND7XEesk32QbXujMgKhf2v5A2ZQANpL
The passphrase is incorrect.
This indicates something is messed up with the **Bippy** with the BIP 38 encryption code, and/or base58 encoding,  and/or the display of the encryption code results.

Four days after the Lunar Landing during 1969 the $10K, $5K, $1K, and $500 bills were starting to be de-circulated by US banks. Substantial infation has occured since then, ~8x. Rogoff's misguided central banker beliefs will surely rhyme with Argentina's fiat currency experience that will further enslave the citizens of the US, and hopefully a peaceful counter rebellion will usher in a tidal wave of demand for cryptocurrency outside existing corrupted centralized banking systems. True prosperity results from the removal of friction associated with today's financial systems.  It is not about the black market transactions fear mongering.  It is about the open source financial Renaissance that is occurring at this point in history.  Making politicians accountable in any given country requires its citizens to control the purse that special interests lobbyist have currently monopolized/rigged.  Switching to an event-driven Austrian Economics Model will afford an order of magnitude greater market efficiencies than the failed centralized cyclic executive Keynesian Economic Model used by most all of today's nation states. The 21st Century will be about the death of Keynesian Economics, essentially a rehash of John Law's failed economic experiments. Few truly understand the "transition phase shift" we are undergoing that is aligned with approximately a 250 year super-cycle, other than recognizing the old system is broken and unsustainable. More government and taxes is not the answer, it is societal insanity. There is no putting cryptocurrencies back into the genie's bottle without a major infringement on human rights. A modern day Patrick Henry will have surely said "Give me privacy-oriented cryptocurrency, or give me death!"

Other salient points, most not discussed in detail:
1. When fiat crashes after trade wars have run their course, can international B2B supply chains be sustained as efficiently with gold? (Remember the impact of WW II German U-boats or today's TSA or Customs to intercept bulk cash movements over $10K?)
2. Is gold forced to be assayed (checked for purity, e.g. tungsten has about the same density of gold) for each transaction as cryptocurrrency is for every on-chain transaction?
3. Metcalf's network effort with specie is almost non-existent when compared to crypto that is going viral.
4. **Backing** always requires trust in specific 3rd parties, versus the consensus of networks.
5. Currencies always need competition. This especially includes fiat, and doesn't exclude specie, and include crypto.  Free markets should determine what is the best.
6. Demographically speaking, Millennial's (Generation Y) will be biased towards crypto, while Baby Boomers will be biased towards specie.  Neither will ultimately like specie.  Only a matter of time before specie is traded by Baby Boomers for Crypto owned by Millennial's. Generation X will be the straddlers.
7. **Can we all just get along?** Markets will exist between crypto and specie for some time. Both specie and crypto are required to end fiat.

Had enough of the **disinformation/BS** about needing a trusted 3rd party to support a **will** when holding cryptocurrency. Look at the example [here]( for a keep it simple stupid (KISS) technique of applying Shamir's Shared Secret to recover the funds associated with a crypto estate. This approach is very extensible and will work with hardware wallets such as Trezor, Ledger, or KeepKey. Hence, it can support multiple cryptocurrencies, not just Bitcoin. **Absolutely No Lawyers Needed**

When using paper wallets for cold storage, make sure they are using the [BIP 38]( AES encryption standard. This ensures if unauthorized people get access to each of your paper wallets they will not get access to your funds unless they also know the private AES password to your private key. Cell phone wallets such a Mycelium and Jaxx support the importation of BIP 38 encrypted paper wallets.  Additionally, BIP 38 wallets can be printed on untrusted/compromised  printers that try to "dial home" like ET without your knowing.

For commercial grade authentication/encryption services to protect USG sensitive information on the Internet requires compliance with [ and **FIPS 140-2**  (utilized the **secp256r1** for elliptic curves).  Such compliance is required by all USG agencies for authentication purposes, and adequately protecting its data-at-rest or data-in-transit.

If **U2F** could support  the **secp256k1** and **ed25519/curve25519** curves that would be cool for those with no shortage of paranoia to provide alternatives...

Use a "cold storage" wallet for long-term storage of large amount of Bitcoin.  Be sure the cold wallets utilize [BIP 38]( encryption so if someone obtains a copy of your BIP 38 paper wallet they can't sweep/import the paper wallet into their Bitcoin wallet without using your password to decrypt the private keys.  BIP 38 paper wallet keys can be copied and placed in multiple geographic location for disaster recovery recovery purposes.  BIP 38 wallets are also safe to print on untrusted printers that might try to dial home like ET.
The security Trezor uses BIPs [32]( [39]( and [44]( standards should be considered a "warm storage" wallet.  Safer than a hot storage wallet, but not as good as cold storage wallet that generates and outputs private keys using trusted software, processes and people.
I'm not going to recommend any one of numerous Javascript BIP 38 paper wallet generators that are to be used on dedicated offline computers. Only recommend using paper wallets where you can enter a private key of your choosing to check the consistency of BIP 38 keys and associated public Bitcoin addresses. Trojan Javascript key generator programs exist, so perform your "own due" diligence and exercise your own "due care" to not put your funds at risk.
If you are a system administration type or software developer see [libbitcoin wiki pages]( for command line details for applying BIPs 32, 38, 39, 44 to Bitcoin and numerous altcoins.  I used genetically independent key generators written in different programming languages to check the veracity of results of Javascript key generators.
