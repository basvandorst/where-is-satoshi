I guess I don’t think of it as a currency for small transactions but rather as a way to control and store securely larger amounts. I guess it’s not solving the problem of sending $40 across the globe so in that sense it does fall short.

Interesting. I just sent a small transaction at 112 sat/B and will report back on the timing.
@_date: 2018-01-10 02:17:49
Perhaps that’s why it was fast. On a percentage basis it’s not terrible but yeah it’s not nothing.

Do you have your seed phrase? Perhaps try restoring.

Question is phrased to elicit a discussion. See last sentence.

Money corrupts everyone including the nerds.

No one in particular. It’s just something to think about really. Where does the price stop? What validates it? Most will say it’s supply and demand. We’ll supply is limited and demand is based on how bad people want it. Let’s say it will replace fiat. Ok so then what’s the value of 1 BTC in that case? Even at $10k I have people sitting 2 doors from me that made a billion dollars. Just want to try and play out this scenario with a real economic lens.

You already have them. It’s called Silicon Valley. They’re all the same once you make them rich.

“Dips” - lol

Not really I am just saying that given the distribution of the bitcoin, you are creating dynastic wealth. It’s just interesting to think about what drives the price now and over the long term. And then what are the implications of that. The market capitalization is value being created out of nothing. It’s net new. That’s not in and of itself a bad thing but it has economic consequences. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 01:19:03
Not sure I said anything about ending capitalism. I’m looking to discuss a scenario playing out when the value keeps going up. Just a thought experiment. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 01:19:43
Yes that’s an interesting way of looking at it. But you will be swapping one super elite class for another. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 01:53:25
The same was said about Silicon Valley and the idealism of the nerd class. Go to San Fran and tell me how that worked out.

For anyone feeling down about missing out or selling too early or whatever, read this thread.

See above. I was referring the separation of the underlying technology from the implementation. Bitcoin is an implementation of the blockchain ledger concept. The thing with the price on it.
@_date: 2016-01-16 18:06:33
Thats pretty F'd up. In early 2014 it was my primary exchange for trading. I withdrew everything in May 2014. Not even sure why.
@_date: 2016-01-20 15:34:55
Sorry my point was that the innovative technology endured why the original implementation of that technology did not.
@_date: 2016-01-20 14:53:07
Thanks burstup. But with these "me-too" blockchains, will that not serve to simply reduce the future market for Bitcoin? I don't see how it would be a tracking stock. It seems more akin to something like Peer to Peer. At first Napster came out and had a lot of value, but it was lawyered out of existence. The technology continued on but Napster itself did not.
So while the concept of a cryptographic transaction ledger is novel and will likely serve as the underlying technology for these new state and bank run currencies, I don't see why they would ever touch the Bitcoin blockchain itself. Bitcoin itself, the coin, the value store, would not really see any benefit here. 
So I guess I am really trying to understand where Bitcoin itself will exist in this new world, as opposed to the blockchain idea.

How does it make stripe irrelevant? Is Bitcoin going to provide a beautiful and fluent API for me to build great payment experiences for my customers? Because that's what Stripe does. Will it provide a perfect admin panel and ecosystem for managing my online business? Doubtful. Saying Bitcoin makes Stripe irrelevant is the same as saying "I have no clue what Bitcoin is"

Sold 20 Bitcoins in 2015. A few more in 2016. Super happy about the $9k. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 19:15:23
Ok that was my thinking. So no chance of someone remotely accessing the unit. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 19:32:03
Sorry about that. All good I will follow that sub instead. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 12:35:43
Be strong!
@_date: 2015-11-05 19:47:02
So this is interesting. The transaction went through at blockchain but now its seems to be stuck in Limbo. Is there some way to cancel? Will it cancel itself eventually? And yeah I just changed the payout threshold to be 0.1 BTC.
@_date: 2015-11-05 20:18:45
Yup. Strange that blockchain just let me do that deal. I guess we shall wait and see :|

Can you elaborate on spacing out the payments. This particular address gets daily tiny payments from a banner ad on one of my websites. How would I space then out?
@_date: 2013-11-30 20:13:53
Thanks Mike. That is helpful.

Sorry for the need to be thorough but I just want to make sure I am clear here because I now have 7 entries in my GA app on iPhone.
* If I lose my iphone I can never log into any of those services again unless I had backed up the original QR code that I scanned to add the service to the app
* If I do back up those QR codes, I should keep them secure because someone else could theoretically install them on their phone and if they have my password for that particular service, they can then get in.
So it seems to me that I should keep backups of these codes. Thus in order to do so, I would have to log into each service, turn off GA auth, and then re-add it. Is this correct?
Thanks in advance!
