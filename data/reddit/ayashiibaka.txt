Ah, sorry to hear that, but perhaps it'll be more useful than it seems. What are you studying?

Why are you assuming that money or material things are "everything I've ever wanted?" Money is just a necessity to live. And I live to enjoy my hobbies. Having money would just mean I don't have to waste my life working on things I don't want to do.

I wouldn't know, but I don't see why that'd be so. If someone does find it that dreadful, they can always find or create work for themselves anyway. Personally, I do just fine being unemployed and spending time on my hobbies.

Spend time on hobbies and improving yourself

That's a pity. I naturally got interested in things like writing and drawing by seeing what others had created and wanting to create something interesting myself. I guess by casually enjoying content like that, and knowing that you can do it yourself with some practice and willpower, you might find the desire to be creative yourself.
I don't know if you can force yourself into a hobby, but if you try a bunch of stuff that looks even a little bit interesting to you, I'd be surprised if you didn't get into something.

You too, good luck mate.

I think so, but it's quite possible I could find a job I really enjoy, if it's in a field I'm interested in (like AI). In that case, I wouldn't quit just because I could live without it. But I'd make sure to always make time for my hobbies too.
You can look at it like, if work is your hobby, then that's fine too. I'm sure a lot of people who spend all their time working might consider it their "hobby", even if they complain about being busy or stressed. It's just that I have quite a few hobbies so I'm very rarely without something to do, so I can't emphasize at all with the idea that being jobless = having no meaning in life.

Oh yeah, I had the exact same experience studying CompSci at uni. And the degree hasn't helped me get a job yet (it can even be detrimental; I had an employer ignore my actual skills, because they just saw me as an inexperienced graduate).
I don't regret getting the degree though, since in general, I think you get taken a lot more seriously with a degree.
Business is actually something I considered getting into as well, but I can understand the feeling of facing a wall you have to scale to even begin to get anywhere.
So I can't exactly offer any advice. But the way I look at it is that money isn't important as long as you have something to enjoy. If you do have to work doing something you're not very interested in, focus on any skills it's giving you, and how the income will allow you to work towards what you really care about.
i.e. I put money into bitcoin for the first time just before the recent dip, but I value the knowledge I'm gaining about cryptocurrency over the fact that I'm losing money. It's fun and good experience.
And either way (and most importantly), I make sure that I have other things I can enjoy and turn to even if the rest of my life falls apart. Things that require no money or anything. I think it's really helpful to have that to turn to. For me, one of those things is just watching anime. I'd totally recommend actively seeking out something like that if pessimism about your future work prospects really does leave you with nothing else to feel good about.

You'd be insane not to, unless you have a very expensive dream.
Most people just want enough money to just live a chill life without ever worrying about money. 20 mill would achieve that. Maybe you could've gotten 200 mill down the line, but more money doesn't make you happier when you're already free. Best to take the sure win.
