Bitcoins value kapatid should NOT  be because mother fuckers are investing money and buying shares of this specific Cryptocurrency in the hopes of "Not being left out" of the chance to be rich. 
Bitcoin's and Cryptocurrency's in general, value should be in it's USEFULNESS in everyday life. 
And as of now, it's not useful to me and the millions living in this country. It maybe useful to Argentina and some other countries who's Fiat is fucked up. 
But to %99.99 of the Fiat using population, it's still not useful. It's useless.

The 1st vehicle ever used a horses "Ropey thingy" as it's steering wheel (Yeah I watched Andrea's videos). I say buy it NOW whilst it's still in it's infancy stages while you can. 
And, I saw an illiterate (in English anyways) 60 yr old Arab Woman with low self awareness (a customer at my store where I work) GLIDE through a Samsung Smart phone (I don't even know how to operate one. Iphone fo lyf yo!) as she was showing me pictures what type of Food Processor she wanted to buy. 
I bet ya it took her sometime to let go of her "Dinosaur" of a Nokia keypad phone before she tried to accept that Smartphone is what she's gonna be using from here on out.
Same goes with Facebook. My auntie is using it and all it's services like cra man. 
Bitcoin is the motherfucking future and it's inevitable. 
So stop SPECULATING the fuck out of it and just sit back, relax, HODL and wait for it to reach $1,00,000 per (Conservative estimation) in the near future.

Yes. Because if and when "WE" do learn to integrate Cryptocurrency as our main platform to send remittances ($1billon a year easy) you best look at the graphs that you stare at every damn day of your life.

I used to think that Bitcoin Reditors are smart folks. 
I just realized that they just bunch of greedy and naive people who thinks that Bitcoin is going to increase in value like it did from 2011-2017 again and don't want to be left out. 
You REALLY have no plans of integrating it in your daily life the way you've integrated Fiat your whole life. You just plan on cashing it all out once it's value becomes higher than you purchased it. 
If this trend continues, then it'll take decades for Cryptocurrency to replace Fiat if that is even possible.
Shame on you. 
SHAME ON YOU.

I'm an OFW (Overseas Filipino Worker) in the UAE (Dubai) and I CANNOT BUY BITCOIN HERE (Coinbase, Bitfinex, etc).
So... how is Bitcoin "Practical" again? I'm still using money couriers like Western Union (High Fees) and Bank to Bank (2-3 Business days) to send money to my wife in the Philippines like it's the 2000's!
So... why is Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency in general being called the "INTERNET OF MONEY" when, I who wants to use it CANNOT EVEN FUCKING HAVE ACCESS TO IT?!
To me, this is just like PAYPAL. 
Good but, only for Caucasian who resides in North America (And maybe Europeans). Yeah... Paypal is still IMPRACTICAL for us to use because of it's huge fees. 
And why make it sooooooo complicated!!
It's like using the old timey computers back in the "DOS" days before Microsoft and it's software where implemented. So fucking confusing! 
Like, just imagine using Bitcoin to buy something at McDonalds:
Me- "One Cheeseburger with medium fries and a Diet Coke please"
Employees- "That will be .00000000000145 Satoshis sir".
Like, how do I fucking know for sure if they're going to be charging me the right amount at each transaction?! Can't they just put a "Buy Button" or something?!
Until this thing is modified that even my grandmother can be able to have a transaction without having a fucking Computer programer by her side to guide her through a buying transaction, it'll just be another glorified Paypal.
Ps. I've invested. Hey! The steering wheel for the 1st ever vehicle was damn "Horse Harness"!

Ang bobo mo tlga dodong/inday. Pag TUMAAS ang Bitcoin, ano ba sa palagay mo ang gagawin mo?!  Na ka pa nood ka lang ng a few youtube video about Bitcoin eh, kala mo alam mo na ang lahat.
You're still going to cash out and use your so called "Worthless Fiat" to buy from Puregold and SM department stores not to mention sa Sari-Sari stores nila Mang Dommeng ��

"That is a ridiculous hyperbole that would never ever happen in the real world. They just tell you the dollar value and you pay in satoshis. How is that a hard concept?"
Say this verbatim to the 1st mofo you see. And find out what he or she is going to reply.

Is that what people told you when you tried to explained Bitcoin to them? ��

That vid just means that, Cashless is SO POSSIBLE! And also a hell of a lot more convenient.
It just need to be implemented in other countries EFFECTIVELY.
