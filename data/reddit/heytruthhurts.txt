A lot of posters here have ulterior motives for one reason or another. (They dislike them because of politics or they want to advertise some other product)  
You always see random negative coinbase posts show up every time coinbase is mentioned in a positive light. Sometimes it happens for other popular services like blockchain and bitpay. It's easy to cut through the bullshit now that it happens right on cue.
Coinbase main product is bitcoin. They only focus on bitcoin. They have done a lot like bitpay and blockchain to get bitcoin accepted and grow the bitcoin ecosystem. They are not moving away from bitcoin or focusing on altshitcoins.

 See. This right here is a perfect example of someone (user/6to23 ) who has no clue what they are talking about, but felt the need to share their opinion. 
 Maker orders have no fees on coinbase.  via
 It's perfect for day trading.

Yes because it's much smarter and safer to trade and hold hundreds or thousands of bitcoins on a unregulated and unlicensed exchange. Right? 
@_date: 2016-04-29 12:42:33
same here. no problems. If you set a limit order on the exchange and it gets filled there is no fee.

Oh the drama filled post title 
Posts like these always seem to show up when coinbase adds a new feature or is in the news.

Don't be stupid nobody is using "divide and conquer" propaganda to ruin bitcoin. i'll you what I think some are doing though, they are using propaganda to move the price of bitcoin in their favor.  Pay close attention to how certain bitcoin players react here and else where when bitcoin reaches highs and lows. There is always a influx of overly negative or positive news during these times before price moves in a different direction and most of the time it's old news or same FUD.
It may look like "divide and conquer" propaganda to you but in reality it's propaganda for selfish reasons like monetary gain that i think is taking place.

price manipulation. These heated debates only pop up when bitcoin reaches a high when it reaches a low silence.
@_date: 2017-03-18 19:03:48
it will disappear once they get their bids filled. they want people to pay attention to price and panic. Then this sub will frown on all negative price talk and only positive price moon talk will be allowed.

 It is usually the same people pulling the strings and making it a issue within the community at certain price targets. They use these "heated debates" the same as the "china banned bitcoin" meme. 
pay close attention to those who bring these "heated debates" front and center.
@_date: 2017-03-18 19:14:51
Same shit as always. These exchanges always happen to go down at tops and bottoms.

Boring.  isn't this the crowdsale posted on bitcointalk that gave huge bonuses to early buyers? And now you see threads (probably from bagholders) talking about it and posting it in r/bitcoin.

No they should leave it as "Blockchain". Bitcoin owns the word blockchain Fuck those other alt coins and private blockchain fucks they can call their ledger SHITCOINCHAIN.
a company called blockchain leads people to a bitcoin wallet that is all that matters.

 Use your brain man. bittorent doesn't have fiat to bitcoin exchanges that operate as banks.If they wanted to they could shut down all the mainstream operating bitcoin sites. EVEN sites like local bitcoins like they do with sites that list torrents. Where would that leave bitcoins future? sure it still might be worth a few dollars in the end but it's user base would shrink considerably and its future growth outlook grim. Not to mention a lot of countries base their laws around US laws. If US bans bitcoin it would have a ripple effect.

Oh so you're saying MSNBC is trying to upset the bitcoin community? LOL get over yourself. Most people outside the bitcoin community don't know who that guy is so why would they care and I doubt MSNBC gives two shits what bitcoin users think.

plenty more clips on youtube.

That's why i said it still might be worth a few dollars because it cannot be stopped fully. But big investors and all the big bitcoin companies would go away.
@_date: 2016-11-17 12:04:16
A lot of that hype came from the bitcoin community and went away when they stopped focusing on bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-05-06 12:14:25
The trolls are awfully quiet. It's not only in debit card discussions they do this.They attack the poster in a totally over the top aggressive manner for using any bitcoin service and almost never get called out.

Please explain to me how depositing or withdrawing to the wrong address is coinbase's problem then? Coinbase does not accept ETC. If anything coinbase has legal ground for fraud against the user trying to send ETC instead of ETH.

How do regulated U.S. exchanges that are insured work?

If they deposit to a ETC address instead of ETH address that is there fucking problem not coinbase's problem.

r/bitcoin is like a premium domain name. maybe one day reddit will make it so there can be multiple r/bitcoin's like  r/xyz/bitcoin or r/bitcoin/xyz/
