Believe what you want, I have clearly done more research than you ever have, I am not going to bother trying to explain it to you. Enjoy your life as a wage slave to this system you uphold ad defend. The simple fact that not enough states even approved the 16th amendment to be ratified makes taxation illegal, but they just amended it anyway without full consensus. 
And I've learned from a number of sources, including documents from the FED and the IRS statutes themselves. And so what if I learn things on YouTube as well? Does the information somehow lose its validity because it is in video form? You're an idiot.

Keep in mind Bitcoin doesn't exist to service fiat currency, it exists to replace it entirely.
Eventually folks will get paid in BTC, and then spend BTC at shops, shops spend BTC to their suppliers, who in turn pay their employees with BTC, and the cycle goes on. This is primarily the problem at the moment in that the Bitcoin economy is not yet circular or even that big  yet. 
Bitcoin is best viewed currently as an asset like gold or a stock and not a currency. In that you are right, buying BTC as an investment will be difficult for those who don't have much "extra" money. But, I don't make much and just buy $10 at a time. 
As far as the 2 Billion unbanked, there is definitely a long way to go there in just getting the basic infrastrucure. But the good part is that many of those people do have Internet connected smartphones these days. Even in a place without running water, a smartphone with a solar charger and Bitcoin wallet app work just as good as anything else. Definitely easier than getting any normal bank to set up shop in the backwater. There are some projects already that focus on this in African countries and other poorer unbanked nations. There are already some projects out there in African countries and others working toward this.

The concept of backing a currency with Gold already failed anyway. I don't understand why people keep saying we should again. It doesn't work. 
Nixon in one fell swoop ended the Dollar's gold backing. What is the point of backing a currency with gold if it can just be removed at will? We should just use the gold. 
But gold is difficult to use on a global scale today. That is where Bitcoin comes in.

It is the wrong way to look at it.
Bitcoin is an autonomous transaction business and a protocol, not simple fiat paper scam notes that represent value instead of *being* value. 
What makes Bitcoin valuable is its network and the service it provides. The same way a Google stock represents the value of their goods and services. Bitcoin =/= fiat currency
Plus, obviously backing a currency with gold is a catastrophic failure, isn't it? One man decided in the 1970s to simply remove the gold back from Dollars, making them and every currency pegged to them effectively worthless. Bitcoin's network is self enforcing, and no one person can just change the protocol like that, ever.

It isnt like slavery, it is slavery. 
Most don't realize your taxes mostly do not pay for things like the military and government programs.
**Your taxes pay down the interest on the government's debt to the Federal Reserve** Yes, some of the tax revenue does go to government programs, but mostly this interest payment is what your taxes are actually for.
The IRS and US Treasury were put in place at the same time as the Federal Reserve (a private bank!), and that isn't a happy accident. 
Oh, and there is literally no law written anywhere that says you are required to pay your taxes, they are totally voluntary. But fighting that in a court is something else because the criminals in charge of our government and court system don't give a shit and will happily sell you to the for-profit prison system we have for not paying into their ponzi scam. 
Nice country isnt it?

I think the fewer police part will come from simply creating an economy where we are all equals, and making money not the primary reason to live like the greedy bastards at the top of the current shitheap Keynesian nightmare. If everyone was getting what they needed, do you think people would still steal or shoot people for reasons of getting money?

This is why Coinbase and others like it have to get into your personal details at times. To interface with fiat they have to play by SEC and FinCEN rules. That is why Mercury can't do fiat.
But there might come a time where there isn't a fiat to worry about anymore. In that case, fully decentralized exchange is all that is needed between cryptocoins.

The truly only great boom was Feathercoin after Litecoin, and then the 100s of shitcoins started to appear, mostly Litecoin clones. I dropped the hammer on my FTC and made out like a bandit before it sank beneath the other alts after the 51% attack. 
But now, it is clear that there is only one Bitcoin, and is the only thing really worth investing in seriously. Though I do dabble in some Litecoin just because it is a decently large network itself, and running on alternate hardware unique to it. It isn't a bad thing to have something else backstopping Bitcoin should something go wrong.

Banks won't have a choice if we abandon their currency.
US Dollars are the invention of the Federal Reserve, a private bank. Our money was not issued debt free by the state like it should have been (Both Lincoln and Kennedy tried to do that, and got iced for it).
There is in fact no fundamental problem with banks other than that they are allowed currency to mint state currency in a bastard union of private interests and state powers. Banks exist primarily to lend money to people for a percentage.
A real Bitcoin bank's transactions would be public record. A Bitcoin bank can only lend what it actually has in its coffers, instead of literally just creating more money (debt) at will. The problem is banks currently have powers they should not have, done by a greedy cabal of bankers and industrialists in 1913 with the Federal Reserve Act, voted into being in stealth.
Plus blockchains and these payment systems can drastically reduce costs and manpower requirements for banks.
This is actually why I think Bitcoin will be dominant in the coming years: it is just cheaper in time and money for everyone involved from business to individual to bank.

There is a certain normacy bias that is difficult to overcome.
When people think about money, the envision physical cash, and the number on the ATM represents this physical cash. Dollars are already mostly digital but most do not see it as a digital money.
Bitcoin is intrinsically paperless. Without something to associate with it physically it feels somehow "fake" or less "real" than paper money. 
The reality is that Dollars and Bitcoin actually do have some things in common, but it is a matter of what people are used to that is the tough bit to get past.

It is still not 100% safe. Do NOT use Coinbase like a bank. Keep a little in there if you wish if you plan to probably spend some soon. I don't care how many multi-sig features and vaults and whatever they have, they are still a centralized business. 
That said, I am a Coinbase user, so don't get me wrong here. I've had good service so far, but I don't keep the bulk of my coin on there. 
The only thing that is anything close to 100% safe is having physical offline private keys that only you control. 
@_date: 2015-03-17 17:01:35
Yup, having 150 separate currencies to deal with in the world that were never meant for the Internet is so fucking efficient. Not annoying at all to play centralized banker games when you are just trying to do business with someone.

Bitcoin is a DAO, Distributed Autonomous Organization, or unmanned business. I am not the first to call it that. Most blockchains could be considered as such. It just replaces a bureaucracy of policies and managers into an elegant code base.

All games with in-game currency should create blockchains for them.
Imagine if EVE Online issued a real cryptocurrency version of ISK with a secure exchange to real dollars. Playing EVE could be an actual job. And why shouldn't it? People work really hard and are really content producers. EVE could be a real virtual economy instead of a simulated one. 
Blockchains could be useful in creating distributed games as well. Imagine virtual game worlds where individuals can host their own pocket of space by running the app.

Essentially what you are printing is a physical copy of your private key(s).
You can think of your private key like a combination, and the Bitcoin blockchain as the "safe". Your Bitcoin always lives on the blockchain (public address), but you can have only one physical copy of your private key. If you lose your private key, that Bitcoin can be considered inaccessible and therefor destroyed. 
Wallet applications, or services like Coinbase, contain your private keys. This is considered ultimately unsafe. Cold wallets give you the same kind of security as any other physical asset. Someone has to come physically take the keys from you to steal your coin. 
@_date: 2015-03-20 15:32:10
The US is faking it better than others, but is not doing any better on real terms.
The markets and reality have completely diverged. And you are pretty much correct in the money supply grew but didn't because of central bank wizardry shuffling interest rates and bonds and whatever else around. 
Ultimately fiat money is the biggest scam on Earth that siphons wealth from the many to the few. Their system doesn't serve us.
With Bitcoin we can change that finally. 
The part they really have wrong that continuous growth is simply a fucking myth. What we need is a *sustainable* economy, not one that grows continuously as we have hit the peak of our production needs. The current system requires infinite credit growth to function, and we are now hitting the limits before the world debt sails off into infinity. 
@_date: 2015-03-19 06:08:54
Well, I don't disagree with most of that honestly.
**If you do not hold the private keys to your Bitcoin, you don't own it, they do**
Do not use services like Coinbase, and especially anonymous drug websites that continuously vanish without a trace or get busted or hacked for their piss poor opsec, like a bank.
Learn about cold wallets and multi-sig to maximize your security.
This is one hitch about Bitcoin many don't seem to understand: no one is more responsible for your security but YOU. There is no bank insurance, no chargebacks, no office to go bitch to, and like this, no way back if they just up and run with your shit. 
I'm not saying this should exonorate any entity that has problems because they were sloppy because it doesn't. You can't do anything against them, you can only protect yourself from them. 
The software itself is getting better and more aware too with time. Many of these security features like multi-sig will hopefully just be ingrained and transparent eventually. Bitcoin is still growing.
