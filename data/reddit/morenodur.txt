Which wallet is the customer using?

Bought my ledger and on the way to secure realize the seed belongs to other wallet

Man I know it sounds shit, but it is the real truth! I still have to find the Ether! It is at the same time because I am trying to put all my coins in ledger and I am finding out all this together

Now I think you are right...i feel and idiot..it is not same manner as before, before was my friend and he was hacked 1 btc, now I am not hacked, just totally sure I had the seed and it belongs to other wallet! Mobile lost...unfourtunately this time is much more amount and I still can see the funds and even send btc to wallet..just withdrawall is blocked! Crazy for me too...believe I am just broke and just looking for help!

Thanks for the really sorry people. I had version 3.3.7 on tablet and 3.3.8 on pc. I thought with the electrum wallet no one could access my funds as my seed is safe. Somehow they were waiting for me to conect inside my wallet to be able to transfer the funds...I am reading the usefull answers and I will try my best to dig deep on the mattee! If anyone have another suggestion will be very welcome!
@_date: 2019-09-05 10:35:30
Do anyone knows if there is any way to get the funds back?
