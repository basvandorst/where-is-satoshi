What we should do instead is explain why Mt.

Technically, Tor also has the exact same kind of point-to-point hidden services as I2P. However, people mainly use Tor as a decentralized internet proxy, which requires less than trustworthy exit nodes.
I2P avoids that security flaw by *not supporting exit nodes*, so it obligates users to stay in the encrypted onion network and away from the man in the middle.
Otherwise, Tor Hidden Services and I2P use the same technology and are about the same.

If federal, state, or military missions overlap, the organizations will compete with each other in almost antagonistic ways. (e.g. US Marines vs Navy SEALs in the Bin Laden raid)

In the end, money, no matter whether commonly accepted like US Dollar, ephemeral like bank accounts or PayPal, universally regarded to be "valuable" like gold, is not wealth.
Money is only a unit of measurement and medium of exchange for wealth. So then, what is wealth and where does it come from?
Once, people bartered their products, but not everyone wanted a chicken every day, and how many chickens would expensive linen be worth? Instead, desirable but not nonessential items, such as gold or jewelry, became used as a measurement and a medium of exchange; like moles in chemistry.
Wealth comes from the Earth itself, based on basic natural resources. Thus, wealth is the physical commodities and product that are essential to or improve our life. Wealth can also the physical and mental labor, infrastructure, and machinery used to extract those resources and put them to use.
Thus, a good money system efficiently facilitates wealth conversion, essential to the specialized workers in the modern economy. A bad money system constantly gets bogged down by inflation, slow transactions, counterfeiting, or speculation. That's all that money is good for.

Unfortunately, it no longer matters how much Google tries to protect your privacy. It's all the same in the end.
The NSA has been proven to be extorting Google and any other tech companies for their data, threatening their engineers with jail time for any sign of non-compliance, or even telling anyone about such threats.
Sure, Google fights it, unlike the others that just bend over. But when they lose, what's the difference? 
This is why Google is untrustworthy. Not because they are evil; because they failed to protect us.

On a related security topic, I make [Libreboot]( [ThinkPads]( , where no proprietary software of any kind is utilized, not even on the BIOS. Run Armory or Electrum on it, or just print paper wallets from it (using an old HP laser printer with HPLIP from the junk heap, of course).
More powerful, useful, extensible, and maybe even cheaper than Trezor. And with Trezor you need to use a laptop anyway. I made a massive stockpile of prebuilt units, since I work at a corporate surplus store.

No need to change the world. Just have your close friends and Skypers switch.
And *it's not the end of the world if Tox doesn't totally eradicate Skype*. Tox is not going to die out. You can use both Skype and Tox concurrently, like any typical government agency. Unclassified info on public wires, top-secret info on secure encrypted wires.

True. Whether Google was willing or not is irrelevant; the NSA extorted them to collaborate with NDAs, so we cannot trust them.
However, Google Authenticator and Authy are based on Open two factor authentication standards (TOTP), and Google Auth keys are never reported to central servers.
We could probably make an open version of Google Auth with TOTP to be extra cautious.
Though seeing as 2FA is generated on central servers, and the NSA has access to nearly all SSL root signing keys, they could just look up the page where you got the 2FA seed key. Bottom line is that if it's on the internet, it's accessible to the NSA.
However, it would be pretty obvious when the NSA abuses their powers and goes beyond observation, so I imagine that any such attack will definitely be a last resort; the "nuclear option" of cyberwarfare.

@_date: 2014-11-20 18:05:57
Do you even haxx? Just look at how the OP's attacker did it.
1. Make a list of valuable addresses from the blockchain.
2. **Look up one of these addresses on Google.** It's bound to be posted as a comment, which links that address to an email they use.
3. Since most people end up using the same password for at least two accounts, **try existing leaked account/password hash combos** *on every major website you know* (from the Gawker or Gmail leak, for example). Gmail might lock you out, but other sites won't. You're bound to find a breach.
  * The OP's attacker may have set up a **JavaScript cookie stealer on an advertisement** that no one reads, which until a user with email and Bitcoin account cookies shows up. This is why we have NoScript and AdBlock.
4. Log into to those accounts, and try logging into the email using those passwords.
  * Obviously, if 2FA was enabled on the email, you would have to try a different account. (Un)Luckily, most people don't have 2FA. And even then, **this attacker managed to work around 2FA.**
5. **Download the Blockchain.info wallet backup** (that they always send to your email, decrypt it with one of the passwords used *(as the attacker above did)* and sweep it.
The attacker has the freedom to try multiple times at his leisure until he succeeds, and a lot of ways to cover his tracks. 
The defender has to know all attack vectors, and protect against every single one indefinitely; even zero-day attacks. 
It's no longer a question of how, but of when. Security is a tower defense game with no extra lives, invisible attack vectors, endless waves from all over the world, and multiple entry points.
@_date: 2014-11-23 03:13:34


But on that note, it's not a one or the other deal.  You can use both Skype and Tox in different contexts, like any major government agency. Unclassified info on public wires, top-secret info on secure encrypted wires. 
Most of all, unlike Google+, Tox has a reason to exist, a killer point-to-point encryption system. It's not going to disappear just because it didn't monopolize the market. 
Your friends might not feel like using Tox all the time, but when they are looking to share classified trade secrets or financial deals, they will look for something with greater security.

If the replies simply tell us how to defend from the attack; that's great, the whole community can learn from their mistake.
But if the commenters get on a high horse and call the defender "stupid" for a mistake or an oversight, that's unacceptable.
Network security is **a tower defense game on extra hard mode with unlimited foes, no extra lives, and new attack vectors added ad infiniteum.** You have to outsmart the attacker tenfold just to survive; which takes incredible skill and experience.
If you're an **attacker**, you only need to try _one or two attack methods_ to win the prize.
* There are a limitless amount of victims, varying from easy to trick and hard to get.
* These exploits could originate in anywhere in the [Dagwood sandwich of computer and network abstraction layers.](
* You can get away with a few mistakes or two, thanks to the magic of internet anonymity.
If you're a **defender**, there is no winning condition, no silver bullet, just "survive for dear life".
* You need to _defend from all 50,000 possible exploits_ at the same time (including _zero-day exploits_).
* You have to defend from virtually any number of attackers anywhere on the internet. The attackers choose the time of battle, not you.
* And if just one exploit succeeds, **you lose everything in that wallet.**

While "the government" did create, and still funds Tor, it is a certain military branch, the US Navy, that did so; which does not share ideals, developers, or goals with the NSA. (Yes, our government is this dysfunctional.)
This is why the NSA is so adamant on trying to break into a system the "US" made for itself. It did not create Tor and would not have allowed it to be created under it's jurisdiction.
However, the only serious design flaw with Tor is that it is used as an anonymized internet proxy. It does this through exit nodes, which have to be given unencrypted or HTTPS information so a normal web server can read it. 
Exit nodes are extremely hazardous to run; you can guess who is the only group able to keep them going. And obviously, if any traffic it receives can be connected to you, (email, Facebook, anything with JavaScript), you are toast. 
But even though the NSA can peer through all traffic, even it's power cannot fully break Tor (as stated in the article), just like it is still unable to break AES. 
However, the NSA probably has clever shortcuts, such as Windows backdoors.
The core ideas and source code of onion routing, when used in a self contained network with no outlet to the full internet (Hidden Services), is perfectly sound, no matter who created it. 
A good example is Tor's competitor, I2P, which does not have exit nodes where attackers could receive unencrypted data. 
This way, all data passed around can only be read by sender and recipient; not by a man in the middle. The onion is never peeled by someone else.
*So how come hidden services have been broken into by irregular Anonymous (attack on FreedomHosting to crush Pedobears)?*
It is because humans are imperfect. They inadvertently leave clues that a sleuth could trace back through triangulation. Their browser is imperfect, it keeps leaking out data through JavaScript. 
If the hidden service website is accessible to the public, one look at this data can pinpoint the creator. On the other hand, if only a tiny group knows about the website, nobody else will be able to see it (except backdoors). A secret is only secret when two people share it.
Even the NSA can only rely on the Sherlock Holmes method when it comes to hidden services; though they have the entire internet's traffic and Windows backdoors to help with the puzzle.

You were wondering why the attacker picked him out of all people. The reason is because his account represents money. 
If you check the blockchain, **you will know how much money is in any random address.** Since there was a large amount in this address, the attacker chose to put time and effort to crack it. Perhaps he failed before, but this time he broke in.

You are right, corrections will happen whenever insane growth appears.
However, corrections are often triggered by certain traumatic events. Mt Gox, as the top exchange, has been a major contributing cause of many traumatic events when most other exchanges were running smoothly. Their instability is giving Bitcoin an undeserved bad reputation, a major contributing factor in a price drop.
Sure, there are other contributing issues that won't be fixed by ditching Mt. Gox, such as inexperience of new buyers, slow withdrawal rates, and mass hysteria, but the fact remains that Mt. Gox is the spark plug for instability and will continue to do so if we stick with them.

The irony here is that Bitcoin is being held back by the very issues it is trying to solve: bank transfers and fiat currency.
These two forms of currency require security, trusted third parties, and thus, exchanges to transfer. And unless you are a full time Bitcoin miner, the vast majority of your wealth is stored in fiat currency, and most businesses sell wealth in fiat, so exchanges are a necessary evil.
Thus, the issues of fiat currency, from long transfer times, money laundering laws, untrustworthy third parties, and threats of theft are what cause the tremendous issues with Bitcoin exchanges. 
These issues will never be solved until Bitcoin and related cryptocurrencies become the primary medium of exchange for wealth, and thus marginalize fiat currency and it's flaws. That will take a while.

@_date: 2015-08-16 20:15:36
Let me clarify. If you remember the Digg Revolt, which we are still studying, their community faced a similar mess of poor management (at the time, it was related to prioritization of promoted content and power users). At one point the vast majority of users just packed up and left for Reddit. Digg as a community was effectively dead, even though it lived as a zombie for years.
Thus, we mean the near death experience of the Reddit community _as we know it today._ This was sparked by [the firing of Victoria Taylor]( *not* by the banning of subreddits, which was a smaller grievance.
It is likely that after all major subreddits went private, that a large segment users would have permanently moved to Voat.co. Unfortunately, that site was unable to handle this uptick and traffic, and crashed itself. Thus, the majority of Reddit users had no alternative and had to grudgingly stick around, and the revolt died down.
This is why internet history has to be recorded. You, and many other users only have bits and pieces of it as a result.

I can rightfully assume that the US government's actions are a result of impulse realpolitik, improvization, schizophrenic political squabbling fueled by constant party change, and incompetence. 
It's agencies often compete, obstruct, and squabble against each other (as known from experience), so I seriously doubt any kind of conspiracy shit that requires an ungodly amount of cooperation and deals between departments that each want the funding and glory to themselves. 
(See the precarious capture of Osama by the Navy Seals, where they recklessly went Leeroy Jenkins into a carefully planned Marine operation)
Even our government's biggest secret, the NSA mass surveillance campaign, was known to exist in some form 3 years prior to the Snowden leaks, from constant insider leaks to Wired and other journalists, and the construction of the hulking Utah datacenter.
It was a juicy story, just not as much of a headliner until Snowden's daring escape. Only it's implementation was unknown, and that was revealed by Snowden.

SRS has this soft power like /pol/, since it's ideals have been taken up far and wide on Tumblr and Facebook , and at least it builds the straw man that many on the Internet fear. It is more of a ripple effect, not always a direct intervention.
And I meant the revolt sparked by [the firing of Victoria Taylor]( *not* the previous ones about the banning of subreddits, which was a smaller grievance.

Now that just blows my mind. It's pretty eye-opening to be able to witness the other end of the political spectrum, so another win for open-mindedness.
I get the feeling that SRS, like other "master troll" communities in internet history (4chan's /b/, 4chan's /pol/), has engineered their reputation to such a degree [that actual extremists find themselves in good company]( But again, I wouldn't be so ashamed that SRS leaves a legacy and vocabulary (SJW, privilege, shitlord) that truly does influence the reactionary judgements and action of the English-language online world. What's your take on that?
That's usually the point where the satire goes rancid, though [4chan's /v/ has gone from]( no video game discussion (good times) to a major force in the gaming community, and back again. What were SRS's ups and downs?
A few months ago, in no hyperbole, Reddit was about to collapse for good. (It was only saved by the fact that Voat.co couldn't handle the traffic). We were lucky enough [to generate a 250GB backup of all comments and threads on the site up to May 2015, just in case.](
So, _hypothetically_, let's say that Reddit is about to die off. Or that SRS has to close for some reason. What threads and moments would you like to take with you, as much as possible? What do you want future generations to remember about this subreddit's legacy, in the viewpoint of the people who were really there?
As a historian, I strive to rescue the past, to make sense of old questions, to rescue treasures, and to see our future. Remember, humans come and go, yet communities still live on, and can resurrect themselves through records.

Moore's Law refers only to the computing power of transistors. It does not refer to vacuum tubes of the past, or the qubits of the future. So it is not the same as a law of accelerating returns of computing, which researchers still aim for.

I would say that it would be more logical to have Mt. Gox be the MySpace, and Bitcoin be the World Wide Web or the TCP/IP protocol.
The World Wide Web as a protocol has stayed rock solid even through economic Armageddon, because it wasn't the technology that failed; the businesses around it did.
When Web 2.0 came up, nobody even considered getting rid of TCP/IP or the Web.

Yes, i know that the little router can run it with a lot of effort. But I'm lazy. And time is money.
I guess if you only have OpenWRT routers, you could save a buck by cross compiling BFGMiner. But I'm probably going to make enough from the miner that I can easily recoup $35 for the RPi.
For new users, it is much easier, practical, and more reliable to use plain Jane Linux using the Raspberry Pi, where BFL tests and updates BFGMiner  packages for you (on Debian, anyway). That's why the RPi is better suited for this task.
The two just don't compare. One's a real computer with massive community support, and the other's just a rare embedded system. Leave the router to do what it does best.

What we need to do is make a fundamental change in what people perceive Bitcoin to be.
Bitcoin isn't just another fiat currency or a digital payment medium; **[Bitcoin is Gold on steroids.]( A hard currency for the digital world, with all it's benefits and drawbacks.
Just like Gold, Bitcoins will have it's bubbles and panics when the economy goes to shit. Yet no matter what, both Gold and Bitcoins have never been fully abandoned because they are perfect for economic transactions.
Why has Gold have value? Until recent times, Gold had no practical use; and anything it could do could be done cheaper by another metal. Why not trade in copper, or shells or something? Gold has several properties that come together to create the perfect bullion: rarity, durability, divisibility, [fungibility]( difficulty of counterfeiting, and decentralized payment, all coming together to create a universal intrinsic value accepted by all mankind for millenia.
But most of those benefits have long since faded as the world changed. **It is high time for a replacement for Gold**, it's difficult to transfer due to it's density, it's too rare to support a global economy, and it's too valuable for modern transactions; let alone the internet. Paper money has gone fiat, only given value by central authorities with the rule of law. The flaws with debit cards and bank accounts are self-evident from the article above.
What we should tell people is not that Bitcoin is some decentralized internet currency. **We should tell people that Bitcoin is a newly discovered bullion.** When we talk about decentralization and anonymous transfer, it immediately evokes thoughts of crime, scams, and money laundering, even though gold is used the exact same way. When we call Bitcoin a hard currency just like Gold, then everyone will instantly understand it's benefits and tradeoffs, whether they're investors or gangsters.
Bitcoin has all of the benefits of gold (with the exception of universal acceptance), and solves many of it's drawbacks. You can effortlessly hold millions on your smartphone, or just pennies. The mining chains continously verifies each transfer, making an attack, let alone counterfeiting prohibitively expensive. 
Bitcoin is also a perfect hard currency, ideal for reserves. A big reason that the gold standard was abandoned and is no longer considered was because it limits money supply, constricting economic growth. Gold is also unequally distributed, giving too much economic power to the countries controlling the mines. **Bitcoins could make hard currency viable again**, because every person in the world is able to mine them, and the money supply increases in a predictable manner to fit the economy that demands it.
If you tell people about mining Bitcoins, don't call it "making money". No wonder people think it's a scheme; it sounds like you make cash for no work. Like a Gold Rush, only the discoverers made substantial gains. Call it "getting paid to verify transactions".

Are traders melting down their gold coins every five years for use in semiconductors or gold foil, or even jewelry? No.
It is a bit exaggerated, but the point is that gold is not a major industrial metal, has a primary purpose of being a reserve, and much of it's few uses were just recently discovered and are barely significant to the gold market.

Using old Android phones would be a good idea, as long as we take care of one significant issue:
The biggest hardware security hole is the baseband, which communicates with the cellular network. It is not open source, it potentially has access to all data on the phone without even Android's knowledge, and it's probably backdoored.
We are going to need to enable airplane mode, or better yet, flash a baseband that breaks cell phone service to prevent it from transmitting your data. 
Of course, tablets and other devices without a baseband are free from this issue.
After that, most of the security holes can be avoided with firewalls, CM Privacy Guard/PDroid, and Adfree.

I believe that Bitcoin will eventually find an important place in the world just like the internet is today, so I'm supporting it in ways that don't involve hoarding and speculating, taking the route of mining at most.
I do not believe that Bitcoin can work as a speculation tool for everyone to get rich. The world doesn't have enough material or markets for steady artificial growth, whether it's the stock market, the internet, or Bitcoin. 
Investors thought that the Internet would just keep printing money. While this was true for a few people at a time, that cashflow didn't last. The technology, unchanged by economic disaster, did.

Don't use your primary smartphone as a wallet next time. It's to easy to lose and too open to attack.
Grab your old smartphone, install DroidWall to prevent any unauthorized apps from accessing the internet, and maybe even install PDroid to prevent apps from accessing certain permissions. This way you can still stay rooted, but have even more security than before. 
Then keep the phone turned off or without WiFi until you need it.

With Google Authenticator, you can easily back up and put the database on multiple devices, but **you must be rooted**. (The guide will say that you can access without root through adb, but that is no longer allowed on current Android versions)
If you don't want to root your phone, the next time you set up 2FA, take a picture of the QR Code so you can reimport it again, or use QR Droid Private, scan the QR Code, and save the embedded secret key (in the format `otpauth://google?secretauthkey=&lt;secret-key-here&gt;`, or something like that).
However, one caveat is that while time-based 2FA can be run concurrently on multiple devices, Counter based 2FA, such as the one that Eclipse uses, can only be used on one device at a time. That killed my EclipseMC account, but good thing I had automatic payout for every 0.02 BTC.

Unfortunately, clean electricity still piggybacks on dirty coal-fired steam. Computers run off the backs for our dysfunctional national electricity network, and the Internet on top of that. New tech always relies on the systems of the old.

We saw the same for the Internet. It's been through much, much worse economic bubbles, with it's failure in the Dot-com boom sending the US into recession. From that logic, the Internet should have been abandoned years ago.

While you are right, this is not because of some crippling software backdoor in Tor or these services (though many exit nodes are run by government agencies, that does not thwart anonymity, unless you leak signature data that can be traced to you), it's because the entire internet is rigged from top to bottom, from ISP all the way down to every major website and ad tracker, as we've seen with PRIZM.

Every major technology has had to depend on the systems of the past. Our electricity is still dependent on coal, then telephones piggybacked on electricity. Computers were nothing without nationwide power networks. The internet had to utilize the phone system to connect computers together.
Likewise, we will have to be dependent upon banks because we have to use fiat and bank accounts to buy Bitcoins through exchanges, (mining isn't for everyone) and it will take a while to wean off such dependence.

Thankfully, it does actually seem that the Bitcoin economy is growing to fit the market, with Bitpay becoming larger than Silk Road, and the sudden increase in implementations of the payment system.
We have already have had 7 major price crashes up to this point, many of which involved severe cases of theft, or infrastructure issues. Bitcoin has steamrolled over them and then some. Even during the most vulnerable times in 2011 where Bitcoin suffered near permanent collapse to $1 from $30, it has still gone strong. 
Even if something like the dot com boom occurred, a disaster that destroyed nearly every tech company of the era, the internet has become integral to the world today.
The value of a monetary unit comes from it's convenience and prowess in transactions. As long as Bitcoin does it's job to maintain it's strength in numbers, (which has not yet been broken) it will survive, and even thrive through disaster.

I think we don't need to "dumb down" Bitcoin, but we need to explain it differently and elegantly.
When I explained Bitcoins to "Dummies", you get vastly different reactions depending on how you explain it. However, if you explain it the right way, people will fully understand how it works, and will generally respect Bitcoin, if not adopt it.
* If you call Bitcoin a new internet payment system with no fees due to decentralization, people will see that it's better than PayPal on that front; but others will pick on the unstable inflation and deflation of the price.
* If you focus on Bitcoin as a fully anonymous and decentralized currency, people will instantly connect it to money laundering, drug trafficking, and crime and be suspicious; even though Gold, which is also anonymous and decentralized, is used the same way by mobsters.
* If you focus on Bitcoin as the "Gold on Steroids" for a new digital world, with all of it's benefits and none of the flaws, then people start to connect it to bullion and understand why Bitcoin has value; simply because, like Gold, it is durable, fungible, difficult to counterfeit, divisible, and decentralized. So both investors and gangsters will understand how it's useful to them.
* Combine the "gold" analogy with an explanation of how a Bitcoin is made. Call a Bitcoin a "math problem", miners "finding a solution to the problem, and then verifying each solution", and a newly minted Bitcoin "The solution to the problem, which is spendable by the first discoverer".
* Then people will understand that they won't need to trust anyone in the community for the Bitcoin; all they need to trust is human greed, which humanity can always depend on.
