It always amazes me how fucking smart he (/they) is. Also that no one knows who he is, it cannot affect the price.

Whales do their homework, they know what a bitcoin is. Only harmful thing is some scammer trying to scam people and we have to tell the truth. "If you repeat a lie often enough, it becomes the truth."

Maybe your account has been used in "eth giveaway"? Meaning someone has access to your account.

There has been Asic for Vtc but they forked. And who would want to buy expensive equipment if they know it will be useless in x time?
@_date: 2018-05-13 14:02:43
Fuck dem asics. Vtc all the way.

It doesnt make bitcoin look like a scam but bcash yes.

This made my day, thanks for sharing.

Vtc is about anti asic and is community coin. Why would normies want to have asics mining when they have gpus? So in the end there would be Vertcoin Cash.

Bcash would fail if it has as many transactions as bitcoin.

Btc = Cash
Bch = Pennies (Those which you want to get rid of)

Ver is starting to fight a losing war. Again, and again Bitcoin fights and survives.

She looked like a man littlebit tbh. 
Great video tho. Im not taking a risk by selling at 10k. Will just buy more if it dips. Also finally an interviewer who doesnt talk about ponzies and tulips like a broken record.
@_date: 2017-11-26 21:59:36
Well, go for it then. I will give you some luck for bitcoins if needed. :D

Where do you live?

Give normies "Easy" money and they will do nice things with it :)
@_date: 2018-04-25 06:23:05
How much you get paid for writing that nonsense? 
@_date: 2018-04-29 19:13:57
Cannot comment on youtube? Wow, they don't want to let people know the truth.
@_date: 2018-04-24 14:48:39
No man. Theres no core, only Bitcoin and its useless forks.
@_date: 2018-04-25 12:26:54
I would count it as scamming. Not the worst scam like bitconnect but misleading new users..
