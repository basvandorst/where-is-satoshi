OK thanks that's what the bitcoin ceo said too. I'll try it �� 
@_date: 2018-01-28 13:20:02
You're missing the whole point
@_date: 2018-01-30 03:13:13
Can you make a web version? I also made a crypto portfolio app in JS and it's cross-platform because it's basically a responsive website. Link:

I don't understand the rainbow �� charts. The scales seem very stretched so it makes me worry it's not reflecting real data? Am I off? 
@_date: 2018-01-28 05:24:18
Depends on which country you choose to live in

For trades to be able to happen no matter what annoying governments have to say about it ��

One word: MaidSafe. 
You're right, except that crypto  will underpin the *entire* internet, not just the financial sector of it. 
Everything you are describing is the MaidSafe network.
@_date: 2019-07-28 20:33:43
Great! Then your expertise must allow you to know how the current intent is such a horrible, unsecure, corporate-owned mess of server farms. And you would be very interested to learn how MaidSafe decentralizes all internet data away from servers and onto all devices, desktops, laptops, phones, IoT and other easily accessible internet connected household objects, and flips the current evil paradigm inside out permanently.

Thanks for the help guys! Looks like the best advice was to leave it shut down and turn it back on for trading after a few years. Seems to have worked for other people so I'll be doing that ��

Nobody can criticize anything before learning / reading / knowing anything at all about it
@_date: 2018-05-26 01:32:52
Yeah it's like he's just totally proving your point ✌

Jesus Christ how can people here in r/Bitcoin be so openly hostile to people trying to creatively expand the bitcoin user base? Why even sub here if you want to see crypto fail so badly? 
@_date: 2019-03-23 14:32:10
OK I'm beginning to see that side of things. Not everyone even really tips in the first place though, everyone has different levels of money. So in my mind it was just better than nothing, but I see your point. I just hope we always encourage everyone who puts effort in trying to creatively expand crypto. Grassroots efforts are all we have. There's no government behind this, pushing for it. Only the people
@_date: 2019-03-23 15:36:39
Crypto will eventually have that. But not understanding that crypto can do many things your bank can't, in terms of freedom, control and many magnitudes more quickly settlements of international transactions would be a mistake on anyone's part. Even in its current form it's a major advancement and revolution
@_date: 2019-03-23 12:56:19
You, and everyone who upvotes you doesn't understand bitcoin. You don't need to do any of that. You can use open wallet tech to just transfer it into a new wallet and hodl, like a long term savings account or investment that most waiters probably wouldn't even have without it. 
@_date: 2019-03-23 13:41:29
He can keep the pkey in case it never gets used in a certain amount of time. But at least he tried
@_date: 2019-03-22 21:40:44
Yeah that definitely made the difference. Need a recount
@_date: 2019-03-23 01:51:53
Don't listen to these guys. You are exactly right. Maybe just be extra clear by writing "this is $10 real dollars worth of Bitcoin in this code" or something so they understand there's real actual money value in it
@_date: 2019-03-23 16:44:44
Big fat phonyyy

Great choice. So much demand, lots of high positions ready in many countries. I've seen this myself. Start with Ethereum solidity and keep an eye on new platforms as they arise: EOS, MaidSafe, and anything else, but totally focus on Ethereum solidity as it is the king of devs (90%+ current share) and will give you the best current possible training for what's to come in this space
@_date: 2018-06-03 01:29:01
He should be facing the other way too
@_date: 2019-04-14 02:10:18
Or embedded into something smaller / more personal
@_date: 2019-04-15 03:07:41
Well, better than I thought �� Good job
@_date: 2019-04-15 01:46:28
Lol you might have your Koreas mixed up. (found the middle-America trump supporter ��)
@_date: 2019-04-15 21:53:17
They just wanna ask him who satoshi is �� that's what all this is about
@_date: 2018-03-01 15:14:00
He said people. You said households. You are both right.

Was this hearing postponed until the 14th or not????? 
@_date: 2018-02-01 09:58:44
This guy's rich
@_date: 2018-02-02 06:59:08
With u m8
@_date: 2018-02-02 07:12:20
Yeah if it goes to $1k it can also go to -$5k and also -$500k is possible as well
@_date: 2018-02-01 09:55:26
What's with all the typos and grammar errors
@_date: 2018-02-14 08:37:05
Yeah who's gonna do anything about it? Try to fight the US Army lol
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:36:50
This can still be offered. But blanket rules mandated by a central group is horrible for everyone and an unsafe / unsustainable system
@_date: 2018-02-24 15:01:06
Wow nobody in this whole thread mentioned tether
@_date: 2018-04-23 06:44:18
 they show interest, tell them to accept crypto through Bitpay. Will take out the risk for them and make it very easy
@_date: 2018-04-25 02:13:49
Don't worry about him lol
