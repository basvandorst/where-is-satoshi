It's already parabolic

I’ll pay now if I can be exempt from taxes for the rest of my life.

When Ido the calculation and realize that all in state federal, ss, fica, etc that I keep less than half of what I EARN..... I don’t feel like it’s benefiting me.

Recently subscribed to this sub.  I invested during the internet bubble.  The posts here remind me of the message boards back then.   This is a speculative space.  Cryptocurrency will go through corrections as it figures out what it's role is going to be. I'm anticipating a 40% dip soon.  It's run too far too fast. Buying then for the long term.  Encouraging people to hold investments that have increased 400% is misguided or disingenuous.

No doubt.   I'm a poker player.  And a stock market investor.   I also have a good understanding of trends because I've been doing this for a long time and making money at it for a long time.  Parabolic moves come to an end.    The overall tend of bitcoin will very likely be up, and I intend to add an amount that won't hurt me if I lose it all.

Think it will test $3000 again?
@_date: 2017-09-11 14:05:26
No.   Did quite well.

Thanks for the info.  Looks like a good entry point. 
@_date: 2017-09-11 01:26:58
No doubt.   
@_date: 2017-09-15 21:37:49
Why, in the short term, will it rise?

This isn't investing right now.  It's more like gambling.  Much like the internet stock boom.   Nobody knows which cryptocurrency will be a winner or a loser.   There will be a winner or two and a lot of losers.  Remember, there were a ton of search engines before google ultimately won that fight.  There are So many parallels.  Right now we are seeing inexperienced investors buying in who will dump their "investment" when we see a large (25% or more) drop.  That's when to buy after this parabolic move.  We will see $2000 before $6000.

Good one :)

Of course it isn't, but even things like precious metals and currencies behave in somewhat predictable ways.  This very well might be a new paradigm, but there have been a lot of new paradigms throughout investing history.  The rules of supply and demand still apply, and investors act in predictable ways.

What are the other applications?   It's an alternative currency.  Has an inherent value based on supply and demand.   Commodity seems to fit.   What am I missing?  I realize that it has the potential to change transactions going forward.  But is it ultimately something other than being a way to buy something. 
@_date: 2017-10-24 01:14:46
I would actually classify it as a commodity currency.   
@_date: 2017-09-13 23:14:25
Will do.  Thank you. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 21:38:21
Precisely. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 22:19:05
You know he's talking about stocks here.   Not a commodity like cryptocurrency.
