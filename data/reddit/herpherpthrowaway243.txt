So many normies here. Despite its flaws, bitcoin has the largest network and is the most battle-tested crypto (security-wise). Therein lies its value. And if you don't understand benefits of blockchain tech such as complete trustlessless/lack of counterparty risk then you have some reading to do.

You're wrong because you've completely misinterpreted the statistic in question. The 51% statistic which is mentioned in your sources is not associated with the number of people who can afford homes in their lifetime. The statistic has nothing to do with affordability.
"At an individual level, just over half, or 51.7 per cent, of Australians aged 18-plus own a home"
Case in point they mention individuals who can afford to buy but chose to rent instead. Or dependents who live under the one household. You do realize that not every adult needs to own a property right? In fact there are a lot more adults than dwellings.
"Professor Wilkins said there was no reason the wealth of older households should grow faster than younger households. You expect them to be richer, but there's no structural reason why they should be experiencing greater wealth growth than the other age groups."
This is the stupidest shit I've ever read. Obviously with a larger capital base you're going to get higher returns.
The sob stories are just cringeworthy. Boohoo a jobless single-mother with 3 kids can't afford to get on the property ladder. Give me a break.
That last article was comical.
"Their mortgage repayments are $280 a week, but they pay an extra $100 a week to pay off the loan quicker."
$380 a week for a dual-income household is peanuts. You could afford that on a single minimum-wage if you're not a complete retard. Why they'd even use that example in an article that proclaims that home ownership is unattainable for millennials is baffling.

51% is not a fact. I can't believe you'd even fall for such ridiculous FUD. As per the 2016 census rates of home ownership are in excess of 60% for all states except for NT. In fact it's one of the highest rates of home ownership in the world. You're an absolute loon.

The 2016 AHAR estimates it at roughly 550 thousand, with only 176K living without shelter. And of these only 1 in 5 have experienced chronic homelessness. Stats indicate that homelessness has been declining significantly.

In other words, you're full of shit and you've pulled 22 million out of thin air. And hey, since Iran is so great maybe we should ship over all of America's homeless over there and see how that goes. Being poor in a country with as many opportunities as America is and has always been a choice.

"An October survey found 27 percent of millennials would prefer to invest in $1,000 of bitcoin versus the same amount of stocks. Harris Poll conducted the online survey of more than 2,000 U.S. adults on behalf of cryptocurrency venture capital firm Blockchain Capital."
Online polls are not exactly accurate, and they'd probably skew towards people that are somewhat more tech-saavy. Regardless, preferring one form of investment over another doesn't mean that they'll actually go through with it. Boomers also have a lot more capital to play with than millennials.

Not that I even have that much capital - there are people with billions out there. But if your mindset is that $100 is a significant sum, I got bad news for you you're destined to be poor.
And no why should I give any of my capital away, that's not how capitalism works.

Yeah, because America is the only first world country. Go look up the minimum wage in a country like Australia.

I don't even think OP knows how fees work. Good luck with your $1 fee transaction being stuck for weeks and then punted off the mempool mate.
New technology? It's been around for like 8 years now with some of the brightest and extremely well funded minds working on it. It's not just a "handful of developers" like you falsely state. It is not in its infant stage.
Algorithm for settings fees? It's based on supply and demand of blockspace. Wallets don't push each other higher and higher what does that even mean. Wallets aren't the problem, the problem is the 1MB block limit and the massive number of unconfirmed transactions in the mempool which drives up fees. LN will supposedly reduce fees but that's still far away and it's got issues.

Where is your source that most people don't have the ability to stay with their parents? Most young people that I know live with their parents rent-free until they finish university, and some even up to their late 20s which allows them to save a lot of money.
Personally I moved out in my early 20s after my schooling. I didn't need a car back then but could have bought one outright with savings. Phone bill was like $20-30 a month. Renting one room in a sharehouse was like $200 a week. Even on a low graduate salary I didn't struggle at all and could usually save 1K or 2K a month by being careful about my spending.

If you're poor, it's probably because you're:
A. Terrible with money.
B. Have a shit minimum wage job.
Both can be solved through education. Put that $300 a month into your education and do what it takes to improve your ability to get employed. Whether it be books, formal education, paying someone to redact your resume etc. It's a lot easier to make money when you're playing with a $120K a year income compared to $30k a year. Poor people are always too focused on saving money, whilst rich people focus on earning more money first and foremost. There's only so much you can save, what you can earn however is unlimited.

This sub is so cringe worthy, it's like a bunch of 10 year olds who are putting their negligible lawn mowing piggy bank into crypto.
$100 is like 4 hours of work for the average American, and it takes fuck all to be average. I don't consider a couple of hours of average work worth of capital to be an investment. Not to mention by the time the exchange takes their cut and you transfer it to a wallet under your control you'll probably take a 50% haircut on such an insignificant amount.

Um, it's really not that inconceivable for a student to save 50K and I know plenty who have.
Where I live the minimum age of employment is 14yo. Assuming that you have a part time job and are supported by your parents whilst in high school it's not hard to save 50K. And if you're a bit more entrepreneurial or make some decent investments you could accumulate much more before even getting to college.

Did you really say "lower intellectual individuals". The irony is palpable. The amount of misunderstandings and complete lies you spew is simply astounding. I won't waste too much time refuting them, but quickly.


You don't understanding proof of work and why it keeps the network secure. It's not a waste of electricity as you claim, it is vital to securing the network. Security has value. Security has a price. You pay for locks on your doors, and you pay for banks (via account &amp; transaction fees) for them to secure your fiat.


No, it cannot currently sustain such transaction volumes, and you clearly don't understand what makes it completely different from those.


Bitcoin is not anonymous so it's actually not as useful as say, monero, for anonymous transactions. You're wrong again.


Slow? That's funny where I live transferring fiat from one account to another often takes days and banks are closed on sundays.


That's a big advantage you absolute dunce. Do you know how much money merchants lose out on from chargeback fraud? Do you realize that their losses are passed on to consumers which means that you pay more for products? Non-reversible transactions solve this problem. Fraud protection can be built on top.

Alts aren't all useless, to claim that they are would be to claim that there is a single use case for blockchain technology which is false.
At the same time you need to be cognizant of the power of first-mover advantage and of having the largest network securing BTC. A quick look throughout history tells you that the best tech doesn't always take first the spot, often it's the first to market that does. However there is room for competitors.

Like others have said, take the time to consider moving somewhere that has no capital gains. There are also plenty of amazing countries where $4+ million dollars will give you a much better lifestyle than what you can have in the USA. In many countries you can live like an absolute king with that kind of money, think big house, maids/housekeepers, multiple girlfriends etc.
Or you could cash it out slowly using things like local bitcoins, or even on the darknet there are trusted vendors that will mail you cash for bitcoins which is even more untraceable. Don't believe the FUD about money laundering and the government taking it all etc. If you're not stupid about it it's very easy to get away with and you'll never be on their radar, plus unless you explicitly tell them you can easily hide how much crypto you actually have so they will never know.

Then you're probably not in the right circles. Jim Rohn famously said that we are the average of the five people we spend the most time with.
A teacher may not reach 6 figures via just regular teaching at a school, but think outside the box for a minute at some side hustles they could have with their skillset or areas into which they could transition.
* corporate trainer
* running seminars/external classes
* personal tutoring
* writing books
* creating online courses, videos, teaching resources, notes and monetizing them
* getting to more senior/leadership roles (i.e. head teachers/principals)
* various other entrepreneurial endeavors
Just a few examples of how they could invest in themselves, particularly early on:
* leadership training
* sales training
* web development courses/books
* entrepreneur courses, public speaking etc
Being a teacher doesn't preclude you from improving yourself and developing new revenue streams. I can think of many people with teaching backgrounds who have innovated or come up with ingenious ways of making serious $$$.
Examples: 
@_date: 2018-06-26 14:44:55
Education doesn't necessarily have to be expensive as there are plenty of free resources out there.
If I only had $200 (and let's be honest, even on a low income if you're determined you could do better than that), I'd think about options such as:
* Doing a certification exam relevant to the industry that you work on. In IT for instance, some certification tracks can legit double the income that you can commend in the market. That's right, that $200 investment on yourself could result in you making 20-40K or more a year. Is that a better result than investing it and making an extra $20 at the end of the year? I'd say so.
* Buying a new suit or improving your appearance. May seem superficial but first impressions count. Believe me if you look sharp employers will notice and it'll give you a leg up. A well fitted suit and a good haircut go a long way. It's an easy fix that makes you standout straight away from the scrubs. You need to dress and present yourself like someone who deserves and can demand 6 figures.
* Spend it on a resume writing/review service. Getting a professional to improve your resume can measurably improve your ability to get interviews.
* Spend it on books or training courses that teach you new skills that you can monetize.
@_date: 2018-06-26 12:43:24
Well you don't even need to invest or risk any of your own money to see how volatile the markets are. Just look at the charts or play with a paper portfolio first. I guess if you want to just get your feet wet and get a taste of the process then sure you can throw in a low amount and if you lose it just chalk it up as a learning experience.
If you want to dollar cost average and keep the emotion out of it then buying a weekly amount could be worthwhile although the disadvantage is transaction costs as mentioned. But I've been in this space a long time and I'll tell you right now that you absolutely have to go into it with the prospect that this is money which you may ultimately lose. There are a lot of risks and uncertainty, from hacks, to making mistakes/typos with addresses, to exit scams, to market manipulation decimating the value of coins. Look at the recent cycle where many altcoins have lost 90%+ of their worth.
@_date: 2018-06-26 12:20:56

Not in your situation. You mention falling behind on bills.
This tells me that:
1. You're probably on low income.
2. You have poor money management habits.
3. You probably don't have any sort of emergency fund.
Furthermore based on your questions it's pretty clear that you have no real understanding of investing and risk management. Asking if any altcoin could be more profitable is asking for pure speculation because no one can see the future, and even if they had some insider knowledge/asymmetric info they definitely wouldn't share it with you.
Let me give you a piece of advice, if you're on low income (and presumably young):
1. Build up an emergency fund that you keep locked away in a bank, this is to cover emergencies and give you a safety buffer.
2. Any spare income should fund your personal development and further education so that you can reach a higher income bracket.
This may not be popular, but my advice is that you should only start thinking about investing once you reach minimum 6 figures income. More income will mean much more disposable cash to invest (granted you don't blow it on lifestyle upgrades) and you'll grow your nest egg much faster than you would investing a pittance on a low income.

I'm not living in a fantasy world, I've been on 6 figures since my mid 20s and I know plenty of people who are vastly more successful than me. It's really not that difficult and I'm not remarkable.
Where did I say appearance alone will get you a good job? I said it makes you stand out from the competition and thus gives you a competitive advantage. Given two individuals with the same requisite experience and background, if one is able to present himself in a more professional manner he will get the job. Thus this is a small investment that can yield significant returns. And like I said, a well written resume will get you a lot more opportunities, regardless of what stage of your career you are at.
I'm not sure what you're getting at with regards to talent but it seems to me like you're using that as some sort of excuse, as though every successful person was born with some innate talent that sets them apart from everyone. Bullshit.
6 figure salaries are found in plenty of specialized IT fields so I'm not sure what you're getting at by mentioning your family?
I'm really not sure why you're so skeptical as I'm not even selling anything. I'm speaking from experience.
Here's an experiment, ask your 3 poorest friends how much they have spent on improving their career prospects in the past year and how many books they have read. Now ask the same question to your 3 most successful friends. The contrast should be obvious.

Guys you can't be serious. $20 is not an investment it's a takeaway meal. You're wasting your time with such low amounts. The transaction costs alone will completely eat into your profit margin. Not to mention why even waste your time like that? You make 10% that's $2 gain (less after fees), surely your time is more valuable than that.
@_date: 2018-06-26 13:55:03
The ROI investing very limited amounts of capital when on a low income is generally not worth it compared to recycling that capital back into self-education and personal development to quickly reach a substantially higher income bracket.
@_date: 2018-06-26 14:23:58
If he earns 10K and is happy with that why is investing even a question? That makes no sense.
No such thing as quickly reaching a higher income bracket? Wrong, people do it all the time. Personally I went from 30-40K/yr to a 6 figure income within about 3 years, and I'm not extraordinary at all, people have done it much faster. And believe me once you're on the higher income you can afford to invest a lot more and it snowballs very fast.
Having a kid doesn't preclude you from self-improvement. Plenty of parents have improved their situation, not sure how that's an obstacle at all.
What I'm trying to say is that if you only have $200 spare money at the end of the month, investing that $200 into yourself will yield better results than your traditional investment vehicles where you'd be lucky to make $20 over a year from such a low amount of capital.

First of all the only acceptable scenario where you'd be working a minimum-wage part-time job is if you're still in high school. And chances are if you're in high school you're living with your parents and have minimal expenses so that $1K a month is mostly disposable income. Your example is stupid.
Now for your situation. You're a double income household with a young child. Your incomes are significantly above minimum wage. And you're telling me that you're living in poverty? Let me guess you took out a 60K loan for a wedding? You spend 10K on holidays every year? A gambling habit perhaps? I refuse to believe that someone with reasonable spending habits on your household income is only able to save $200 a month. That's utterly ridiculous. If you want to prove me wrong, list out your combined incomes and an outline of your monthly expenditure.
You have a child and only $1k in savings? That's just terrible honestly. You don't have life issues, you have spending and money management issues. Your cash flow is probably very badly managed.
I literally cannot understand how that is possible. There are plenty of 15 year olds with more savings than that. Think about that. I had saved more than that working as a paper boy at like 13 years old.
Even early in my career, when I was on like 32K a year living with a housemate I was still able to save over 1K a month and whilst I was living modestly I was no pauper.
I'm 30 now, and on a reasonable wage. I live comfortably and spend quite liberally but I'm still easily able to save between 3 to 8K AUD per month depending on the month. My GF also works and saves more than that. Not saying that to brag or anything it's not even really that impressive. But it just boggles my mind that someone can be older than 18 and have just 1K in savings.
@_date: 2017-09-03 03:40:20

No doubt it will be an issue, but you gotta remember that people aren't going to go 100% in crypto anytime soon. Most people won't have significant funds in crypto. And heaps of them will unfortunately just leave it on the exchanges.

Could also be nearing the end of the bubble. When normies on facebook are asking how to get in on it because they want to be rich because they read about some kid who bought $100 of BTC a few years ago and became a millionaire you know there's a problem. What's changed since 4 months ago? Segwit has been activated but has barely made a difference, BTC still has high fees and stuck transactions, the split is now competing with BTC, I don't see any real growth in terms of adoption. Every post is about FOMO and how everyone's going to have lambos. When it eventually drops a bit, there's going to be panic and a huge selloff IMO, like usual.

Cost of living in the USA (baring a few cities) are comparatively much less than the costs of living in Australia.
The median personal income of a person age 25+ employed full-time with a bachelor's degree or higher in the USA is 71K USD. For a high school graduate it's 38K USD.
These are median figures and if all you aspire for is to be at the median then you don't have much ambition. So the opportunities are certainly there.

You forgot scalability as a disadvantage (a major one). At this stage, and for the foreseeable future it cannot scale anywhere near the likes of Visa. In other words scalability constraints means that BTC cannot process enough transactions to compete with the big boys, so it's not just speed but volume of transactions.
You also forgot lack of real anonymity. And I'd say for the moment, volatility is also a big disadvantage. And as for being abstract, I think this really applies to all generations and it's naive to assume it's mostly old folks who don't understand it. The average millennial probably couldn't really explain it to you.
What about lack of regulation? It's great for innovation but look at all the exchanges that have been owned, look at the market manipulation, look at all the scams etc. It's still the wild west.

Buying the cheapest car you can afford means it'll probably be unsafe, uncomfortable, breakdown all the time, and end up actually costing you more time and money. Not to mention the impact on your ego and the way that people look at you (let's not pretend like this does not matter at all, it does to an extent). Basically it's like only buying cheap shit clothes, or skimping out on food to save a few bucks.
I also used to subscribe the the frugal millionaire next door mentality, but if you have the funds it's pretty ridiculous. A nice car costs you what, maybe 10k a year in running costs &amp; depreciation? If you spend a lot of time in your car, have a decent asset base and you're on a good income, then 10K a year is really not that significant.

I'm in IT too and went from starting at 30K to 6 figures in 2-3 years. The key is aggressively pursuing opportunities, not being afraid to negotiate, using leverage if you have any, being ready to jump ship if advancement opportunities are not there, mastering the job searching/application process, and using dumps for certification exams (knowing your stuff helps too). Depending on your track, the couple of grand that you might spend on certification exams could double or triple your salary in a very short period of time.

If they don't have a lot of disposable income, then that money would be better invested in themselves &amp; their education so that they can actually generate more income which they can then put towards investing. A $50 investment? Come on that's like an hour or two of work for your average job. Kids get more pocket money than that.
Not to mention the ridiculous percentage that will be eaten up in exchange fees &amp; fees when transferring to your wallet. Makes no sense at all.

I have a 13th word in my seed which is omitted from my paper backup. So in the event of a theft (which is extremely unlikely given that this is an extremely secure facility), I would hopefully have enough time to recover my coins and move them to a new wallet before they manage to bruteforce the 13th seed word (which tbh they wouldn't even know exists).

He was reaching the whole time. Probably because he doesn't actually have any facts and this is nothing but a lame hit piece. He hasn't even looked at the actual material.
Just envious and jealous that he doesn't have the marketing skills or advertising capital to compete?
If bitcoin crashes you lose everything? No I'm pretty sure you'd still be rich as fuck with 10,000+ BTC, what a load of shit.
Tai Lopez never pretends to be a bitcoin expert. However he is an expert at networking and at bringing the best in the industry to teach and deliver his courses.
Is Doug a dirty commie or what? He has a go at someone making money by providing a product? Maybe this hypocrite should demonetize his YouTube channel then. It's a tired model, be a contrarian and attack others with ad hominems. It's lame.

Come on, no disrespect but those are baby amounts. I'm not advising people to invest all their money in bitcoin, quite the opposite you should always be diversified. What I'm saying is that if you're playing around with such low amounts of capital then you should probably invest that money into expending your capacity to earn income because ultimately that will determine how much you are able to invest.

Get out of your r/bitcoin groupthink for a little while. Not all ERC-20 tokens are complete horseshit, there's plenty of innovation. Take it from someone who only held BTC from 2013-late 2017. I missed out on unbelievable gains in the altcoin markets because of that kind of thinking.

I don't know where you live, but in Australia the average wage is 78K or about 1.5K a week. Divide that by 38 hours and that's nearly 40 AUD an hour or about 31 USD.
If you're educated and have skills that are actually in demand, then 25-50 an hour is nothing, and who the hell wants to be average. Maybe move to a country were you actually get paid a liveable wage and have better opportunities?

You're a dunce if you don't think that banks have a legitimate right to recoup costs on overdrawn transaction accounts and credit cards that are paid late. Don't like the fees that are imposed on you? Take your business elsewhere.
Also LOL if you really think that a significant portion of the bank's earnings comes from fees. That's simply not true.

What can you buy with Bitcoin? Plenty of good &amp; services, you can pay your bills ( This will increase at an exponential rate as LN is rolled out, or as better tech establishes itself (i.e. completely feeless cryptos that scale better). The writing is on the wall, merchant adoption will continue to increase and there are plenty of crypto projects working on making it more seamless for both buyers and sellers.
Volatility (as a risk for merchants) can easily be addressed by stable coins, and will reduce as the market matures.
If you work in the tech sector and can't wrap your head around the breakthrough that is blockchain-based tech and the the technological revolution that it will usher then you're probably in the wrong industry.
Securities, real-estate etc will all be tokenized. Massive efficiencies and cost savings will be realized.
Now go back to your pleb job and continue to indulge in your little Dunning-Kruger bubble at your own peril.
I'll leave you with this - look at some of the talent that is working day and night on crypto projects. Do you really think that you know better than all these comp sci and economic PHDs who realize the disruptive power of this tech.

Thanks for the reply I appreciate that you took the time to list that out. I apologize if my previous post was harsh.
We've confirmed that you had some poor financial role models early on and made some poor decisions and also had some unexpected issues that cost you quite a bit. At least it seems like you're slowly turning things around and the fact that you have a clear picture of your monthly income and expenditures is a good sign. There's no denying that American healthcare is fucked. In Australia I pay about $120 a month for private health insurance (which isn't compulsory) and that seems expensive, $650 USD is crazy.
There's definitely a few expenses which you can cut down on, but really if I were you I'd really focus more on increasing you and your partner's earning capacity because there's no denying that 40K is not much to stretch between a family of 3. Once the debt and emergency funds are in place, I'd take that surplus and invest all of it into yourself (or your partner) to increase the amount of money you make. Whether it be self-education, formal education, a new suit etc. Really that should be the primary focus of someone on that household income IMO.
The measly returns you'd make on investing 200 into bitcoins or shares or w/e are nothing compared to the long-term returns made from say education which doubles your income.

Well I can't comment on Europe specifically but in for example Australia, even with a student visa, you must demonstrate that you have sufficient funds at your disposal to support yourself during your stay. If you watch those border patrol/customs show you see them interviewing people about this all the time and many are sent right back if they don't have funds.

I wouldn't trust reported crypto trading volume numbers. Unregulated markets means that wash trading is common place on a lot of exchanges. A large portion of the volume is completely fictitious.

There's nothing false about it. If you actually follow him it's clear that he's extremely wealthy and that he knows a lot of people. When's the last time you had dinner with Steve Balmer?
A couple of years ago he realized the rise in popularity of personal branding and he absolutely dominated that game. It's easy to hate on people based on first impressions, but he's easily more successful than 99.9% of people who are talking shit here.
Go pirate his 67 step program and tell me if you don't get any value from it. I went from thinking that he was a sleezy marketer to realizing that he actually provides serious value.

Illegal and heavily controlled? Shit that must mean that it definitely doesn't happen. Importing large amounts of illicit drugs is illegal and controlled, guess that means it doesn't happen. Doping in the Olympics is heavily controlled, guess that means it doesn't happen.
Do you even realize how difficult it is to police insider trading and market manipulation in the stock market? Do you really think the government has the resources or ability to keep up? Do you realize that it's 1000 times more difficult to police in the crypto space? Not to mention it's largely unregulated anyways and since it's global the manipulator could be operating in any jurisdiction.
And I'm not talking about someone who lucked out on crypto in the last few years with minimal upfront capital, I'm talking about people trading significant amounts in 2018.

So? Past returns are not indicative of future returns. BTC's history is like 8-9 years, not exactly very long. And even some asset classes with 70+ year histories have dropped in the past and never recovered. Let's not act like there aren't serious risks. And I say this as someone who's been holding since first buying in at $100 per BTC in early 2013. It's important to keep some perspective.
