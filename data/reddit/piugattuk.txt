Well...guess that's, that, the 'peer to peer' has been taken out and the middle men are back to take their cut, the concept was good but the problem is that bitcoiners want their bit coins to be worth thousands so they push for it and the magic genie makes it so, only he wants his cut.

I chased the dollar all my life, I worked more then 330 days average every year for 20 years, finally coming down sick in hospital, during my down time I was stressing over not working, my disability lasted long enough for me to realize I forgot how to actually live, to just sit and enjoy the simple things, now I've got no choice, my health only allows me to work part time, but I actually enjoy my extra time to do as I please.

I know that is a vague reference that many won't understand, if you have so much wealth but horde it, and buy all the material things it can buy, enjoy everything you can eat and drink, in the end when you've had your fill and then some there is a point that the returns on enjoyment are not there, everything is mundane, but to the point;
When you actually put the monies to work by building things, giving, and investing in people, by learning things, this is the point, you actually know your making a difference in the world, in the lives of others, the happiness you get back is worth so much more, but most people don't get it, they stay in that zone of negativity, of sarcasm, despair.

Money, bitcoin, gold, silver, etc, it is not how much you have but how you use it, true wealth is health, when you don't have it most anyone would trade all their trinkets (electronic or otherwise),  just to feel better, a person with a few dollars in his pocket can be happier then a multi millionaire who worries day and night about his monies, don't waste your life by measuring it by how much "money" you may have.

See, what most of you who feel "secure" that's great but you must understand get it through your nerd heads the general public is not savvy about how to securely keep most of anything online especially against criminal hackers out there, if Coinbase got attacked / MTgox got fucked up what chance do you think the average person has.

But OP understanding for those misinformed and ignorant because many people just don't have the ability that you do, on the other hand you may not be able to comprehend things that are elementary to them, instead of driving them away help them with a pre-written Q &amp; A text doc that you can copy and paste as you see what works and what doesn't sink in refine it and put a "tip" QR code so maybe you might profit from being informed. You don't beat them down driving them away from bitcoins cause you want people who depend on services you can charge for...never ever drive profit away, if bitcoins does not get adopted more widely then it will eventually die no matter how good WE think it is, you don't think big companies aren't seeing this as a way to promote maybe their own "bitcoins" growth or die that is the law of survival.

It actually has me stroking my chin say, why would someone sell gold for bit coins rather then gold for dollars? I mean why dump valuable metal for crypto currency, never do these people do things like this without a reason, if for one it isn't physical gold but rather a piece of paper saying that you have it held for you in "deposits" at the place you're buying from well if the feds say no to crypto currencies for gold all of a sudden why do these guy have to honor returning your BC stating some crazy shit and keep the BC cause how can it be tracked afterwards... just shocks me that they are exchanging gold for crypto currencies when they can have dollars, on the other hand if dollars collapsed hummm, BC value could go through the roof...I don't know crazy theory?

Hi Adam hate to party poop but Coinbase needs to continue improving itself, I had a Coinbase account, verification amounts went through but when it came to purchase no dice, the problem was unclear but I think it was a glitch in the system, things I would say are too chaotic with purchasing bitcoins for the public at large I'm sure many disagree but I will just continue buying in face to face meetings, if you really want it more widely adapted then ATM style machines that we can buy from would be something that your company should be trying to get out there cause more availability means more wallets to spend.

I'm hoping bitcoin will survive this period the real ones taking bitcoin down is hackers, bad providers, slow infrastructure, bitcoin would go down faster now if the general public got in it now because the amount of theft would get the US government involved trying to shut down what they and the public perceive as a haven for scam artists.

As a software engineer you have an opportunity to really make a change for the whole darn country, as I'm sure you have heard sometime ago they wanted to introduce the AMERO it failed for many reasons however with the climate the way it is a relook at reintroducing a crypto currency made for N. American continent might be something they might bite for this time but just as bitcoins seem to be here to stay the need is very much there, remember AMERICAN TRAVELER CHECKS was the way to go long ago, then came plastic replacing the checks, now digital currencies is the future, keep your money safe in the cloud and download as needed now with NAFTA drivers from other countries coming here but have to carry cash or other form of payment but the convenience of a N. American currency would solve this including people able to travel to/through Mexico without a shakedown as cash is not carried there is so much need for the billions in trade that go on helping the government establish a crypto currency would leave its creator very well off hell Iceland has introduced the Aurora why not a currency for N.

Bitcoin was DOA, IT will be replaced by something with more ability to be used by common everyday folk, bitcoin was made to "anonymous" not mainstream, it will be a novelty at some point but nothing more, so many thefts of bitcoins, so many scams.
I love bitcoin when it first came out, thought it was revolutionary (it is), but it has way too many risks for mere mortals to secure it properly and that is it's greatest flaw, something the bitcoin community doesn't seem to grasp, bitcoin may be one of those things ahead of it's time.

Money is worthless, it's just that we use it as a medium of exchange for a transaction, same as bitcoin, to me gold is worthless as well, bitcoin can be used as a medium but it is in the hands of the few, those that have the "wealth" right now have no reason to push bitcoin as a medium also given the fact that the blockchain isn't good enough to support many transactions fast enough, and for the average non-techy person it is cumbersome to use, and average people have no stake in it's adaptation, chances are at some point those who own the banks will move to crush bitcoin.

@_date: 2017-09-27 20:35:40
Well the problem I have is that it (bitcoin), is the same as fiat money, its only a faith based belief in value, and then the value is only based upon what fiat money will buy you, unless we move back to gold and other valuable metals as a currency then it is only faith, kinda the same when gains in gold only reflect inflation, which is no gain at all because inflation increase ate the value of the gain.
It not to say there isn't a place for bitcoin but only that if value is reliant on the value of fiat money, well you get my drift.

You see I'm not attacking bitcoin at all, many bitcoiners take anything not hyping it up as an affront to their religion and for me that's a problem, I want to just try and be as objective as possible but also want to keep in mind human behaviors and it's effect on everything.
I may not understand fully how to maintain a bitcoin wallet but I do understand it's function, fomo is not one of my problems, if it was I would have bought when bitcoin was just tens of dollars, or even hundreds, fomo is not one of my issues, I have followed bitcoin almost from the get go and even had a bitcoin wallet, it wasn't fomo I assure you but it is also knowing that when things are hyped up and trying to speak to other who seem to be more fanatical comparable to a religion and any questions are met with a wall of what seems blind following, yeah that gives me pause.
I like bitcoin's concept, I don't like something that is in the mists of hype, will I miss out, already have, could have bought when it was near nothing, do I wish I had some bitcoin's put away, sure, do I fear about it now, no, take for instance people saying they will buy a house for one bitcoin some day, if this is so then $1000 worth of bitcoin would be $300,000 on that day, 300X the average house price, so no, the train hasn't departed yet wouldn't you agree based upon the potential you believe and many others do, I haven't missed out, I just don't run into the hype train just because the whistle blows.

I may not be into bitcoins and may not think it's user friendly, but i'm not blind or dumb, bitcoin has interesting possibilities and to just down right attack it shows either jealously that they didn't hop on the train when it was cheap or ignorance, and downvoiting is just their way of trolling because it's easy pickings when people love and believe in something so the best way to rattle them is to attack it, I wouldn't be bothered.

I would not take out a loan for any investment no matter how good it sounds, if you can't afford to lose anything you are investing then don't invest.
Risk can payout rewards, but risk when you already have risk by having debt is foolish and this is called gambling, an activity I rarely indulge in, for myself I am bit more conservative about risk, seen too many people go down in flames over foolhardy behavior looking for shortcuts, they rarely work and I'm definitely not the exception.

Not much to give, just as stated it's just too new to be viable at this time for the masses, contrary to some that believe people who don't "get" bitcoin are somehow slow this I assure you is not always the case, I have researched bitcoin pretty well and over 2 years ago I wanted to get bitcoin along with litecoins (we saw what happen there), but I could not get people to face to face meetings to "exchange" fiat for bitcoin or litecoin, I signed up to buy online...at mt-gox, but somehow I could not buy it (months before it crashed), I tried another exchange and was having better luck, before I bought some the bitcoin wallet was reported here on reddit that it was compromised and that coins in the wallet had been hacked and stolen, I was so disappointed, seemed like everywhere I turned I was dodging getting ripped off by shear luck.
I started to research what can be done, then learned to be absolutely safe I would have to "offline" them, I looked at the process and said ok, seems easy enough, but further in was what we all experience, if you lose your keys you lose your coin forever, if "something" went wrong...between my military training and being skeptical, including I live by "what can go wrong will go wrong"
So I searched more, ok, keep them in the cloud somewhere but where, seems like everyday you hear about hacks and comprising of seemingly impossible places.
The bottom line, I've decided that it is more trouble then it is worth when I have my card, my fiat at my convince, my card has protection provided by proven institutions and my money is only vulnerable to those who can get my wallet from me, and at least there it comes with a face, until there is more widespread safeguards and convenient ways to use it, I can use my NFC on my smartphone at retailers to pay just like (similar), to bitcoin, and the thing I can tell you is bitcoin has not gone unnoticed by others who want a piece of the action namely big institutions who see this as a way to keep customers coming to them, believe that.

"because people lack critical thinking skills" and we have president trump...that is exactly my worry for bitcoin lately too many fomo's rushing in where they don't belong causing issues, but that is good for bitcoin for short term profits but long term it will cause a lot of unnecessary government oversight with unknown outcomes.

As one who has felt negatively about bitcoin let me say, I stand by my statements that for the common person its just a novelty because it has too many holes in the way it's always getting hacked and stolen and untraceable and also too technical, the risks far outweigh any benefit even though the alternative is fiat at this time it still is safer in most countries then bitcoin in all countries, I don't hate bitcoin just the structure built around it.

The reason I'm asking is because just recently a bitcoin machine was put in my area where I shop, since I now have access to a machine without traveling so far I am going to buy $1000 worth of bitcoin as a sort of investment because I do believe it will gain in value over time, regardless losing a $1000 is not going to hurt me if it doesn't work out not because I'm rich only because I have done well at keeping debts low and am on the verge of being debt free and will have more money free to invest in ventures, to diversify, to hedge, my savings is growing so saving isn't an issue either...but I believe in fully vetting something and never blindly do something especially while it's in a fever, if it's as good as people are hyping it, it will be there long term, bitcoin for all it's ups and downs has survived and thrived, fair enough, I will buy a piece of the action.

I think people are missing the point, millions of people are vaping, a few have gotten ill or died, the government is stepping up to quickly regulate and outright ban vaping, the problem with government is it's overreach in matters that become sensationalized, people going broke, and losing everything at some point maybe even commit suicide, believe me government is going to take an interest and probably won't have positive outcomes.

Good read, it's as I've been posting all along, and to add I think bitcoin will fail if something with a more secure ability and accountability comes along,  maybe Googlebit.

I'm gonna open an bit exchange then steal all the coins, seems like that's all they do anyway and many people continue to deposit, and the law can't do nothing.
@_date: 2015-03-14 01:46:18
Yup, bitcoin exchanges are phaser inc...it's only a matter of time till they run off or oops and bitcoins go poof!

Why does it seem that some Russian dude is always involved in some nefarious activity involving large amounts of cash (lack of better word), often involving computers.
@_date: 2017-07-26 15:25:52
Probably right, I should have worded it better nefarious in the eyes of the establishment, but Russians are still some kinds of characters.
@_date: 2017-07-26 15:28:46
And Russians blame the west, the west blames the east, generation Y blames millennials, and the circle jerk continues....on and on, this way nobody takes responsibility.

Well, since you sound like a risk taker but also found out how debt can keep you down, you got lucky, I say take another risk, upgrading a home is great but let your home do most of the work in equity.
Buy stuff that keeps you independent, a solar system, atmospheric condenser, 25 year emergency food, learn to can, maybe even aquiponics, never look back.
Timing was everything, I missed the boat, if I had what you had I'd spend little of it to be more independent from mainstream.

I wonder why they're are so many sociopathic people around the world always trying to get over on others sadly instead of using their brains to improve their life without scamming.

Here's why it absolutely does need to have mainstream adoption,
1. Without it there's not no need for better, bigger infrastructure.
2. With no need for growth there is no investment, without investment most things tend not to grow and eventually die out, the law of adapt or die (evolution), applies to bitcoin.
3. As the "coin" is out now you can be assured there are big box companies looking at how they can "profit"  too as proof I present air miles, ever heard of trucker bucks, dogicoin, and so on, everybody wants a cut and bitcoin better move it's ass before something else becomes something mainstream.
4. Value is something that people can trust, most people cannot trust bitcoin because it has been scammed, robbed, lost, destroyed, and just no way to recover once it's gone (the perception).
5. I had great interest in bitcoin and still do, here's why I don't use it, it's inconvenient, it's not as easy as using fiat, or cards and checks, understanding, it's parts, it's ease of use, it's security, a coin, a satoshi what the hell is it (most people dont understand this), how it breaks down the mathematics behind it (see overpaying), as people get scammed sending too much.
The point is without mainstream adaptation it's value will be only a small fraction that it could be, and it will be someday a novelty, something that will be a passing curiosity in a webpage as something that surpasses bitcoin because people understand a less techno currency (as is plastic cards are), and is easier to use, bitcoin is on borrowed time, on loan from the community that has hopes for it.

We need a new game like the star trek tongo, but instead of Latinum we can use bars of silver, or other metals like copper, etc, people love shiny metals.

Time for Germany to bail them out...oh wait, Germany is also having problems with Deutsche Bank.

Bitcoin to me is not what it is to people who already seem to worship it, for bitcoin to be more than a novelty it must grow, in order for growth it must become regulated, problem is that mainstreaming it robs the original spirit of why the inception came to be.
While I have no problem with digital currency as bitcoin continues to mutate into a source just like money the more interest will bring it to a point of corruption just like money, to be exploited (in a bad way), and those that have it will be robbed by those that want it (governments and regulatory bodies), in the short term there is gain to be made but if you believe that those in charge will allow bitcoiners to be a 1%er you are still holding on to a fantasy.
@_date: 2016-07-17 05:05:36
Well, let's hope things change because we don't need more instability in the world, the world must change but nobody is willing to take the painful steps necessary.
@_date: 2015-02-26 14:57:14
That's exactly my point, that's what i'm trying to impress upon the bitcoin community, they envision buying a home with one bitcoin, how it will rule, but that will never happen the longer the issue with mainstream adaptation is something that doesn't get solved and as far as I've (think of me as the customer), seen it doesn't do anything for me except being something of a novelty, hopefully it will pave the way for something.

Just patent the term bytecoin, or how'bout gigacoin, megacoin, binarycoin, netcoin, quadcoin, fastcoin, globecoin, versecoin, dotcoin, dashcoin.
