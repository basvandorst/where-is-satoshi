So I got paid yesterday, and I'm at the office atm. I don't carry my passwords with me so I can't buy any bitcoin at the moment. If the price bounces back to 13k before I get home, I'll do a Mcafee and bite one of my balls off.

This argument works only with tech advancement already proven useful by hindsight. 
Every single advancement in technology had detractors before it became mainstream and useful, but that doesn't mean that every technological advancement that has detractors will eventually become mainstream or useful.
I'm not criticising BTC, but rather the argument, because honestly, this just makes the regular BTC enthusiast seem as someone naive and gullible.
@_date: 2019-07-22 18:22:20
No one cares but I wanted to share my story. 
I started purchasing BTC a couple of months ago having a blast and all that, but a couple weeks ago I've been having some economic difficulties that have render me unable to purchase any additional btc (I haven't sold yet nor I plan on doing it).
The thing is that the price has been fairly stable since my money problems started, which has helped me ride this whole situation a lot better since, if the price skyrocketed I would get massive fomo, and if the price took a dive, I would get sad for not being able to purchase btc.
I just wanted to share my relief with someone since my friends always hate it when a say anything BTC related, and my gf, although is always supportive, would feel bad that I have money problems since she doesn't have a job and can't help me at the moment.
So yeah, I know most of you are waiting on some major movement. But for some of us, this quietness is just what we need, at least while we get back on our feet.
Always hodling never not hodling.

Not to be that guy, but hasn't media constantly stated that BTC is dead?
@_date: 2019-07-08 14:06:39
One of the supporting arguments for the "to the moon" thesis that I've heard is that there's 17'000.000 BTC but there's only 40'000.000 millionaires in the world, hence after the inevitable failure of fiat when they decide to adopt crypto, the prices will skyrocket due to supply and demand.
I would like to know where does people get that number of millionaires from and how wealthy is the 40'000.000th millionaire.
Also, I'm not only new to crypto, but I also know nothing about economy so I want to know if maybe the ever increasing scarcity of BTC would discourage mass adoption instead of help it, since BTC's core value is its convenience and freedom as a currency, but if its price does skyrocket, it would be the equivalent of trading with diamonds.

Here I am hoping this to cause a juicy dip
@_date: 2019-07-03 11:37:19
That's not a stupid question, thid was a stupid infographic. It explains nothing at all...
@_date: 2019-07-22 18:59:07
Yeah I can manage things so far without selling. The way I see it, once I put money into btc it's gone for good.
@_date: 2019-07-16 22:03:06
Shit man, I'm too newb at bitcoin to be able to wait for a 7k dip. How long do you think it would take for btc to dive that low?
@_date: 2019-07-22 21:56:09
I'm not whining, all the contrary, I'm expressing relief.
@_date: 2019-07-27 16:12:24
I'm here patiently waiting the IRS letters to cause a massive dip for another bitcoin summer sale.
@_date: 2019-07-22 21:58:35
Oh yeah I'm cool with the losses. Actually I fear more the price skyrocketing and me not having enough Sats than it dropping to 0.
@_date: 2019-07-14 16:06:07
Or you can buy peer to peer in Localbitcoins
@_date: 2019-07-07 14:33:19
I once saw a graph showing the average amount of BTC per wallet. It was used to support the idea that most of the wallets in existence had around 100 usd worth of BTC on them.
1. Does anyone saw that graph and can link me to it.
2. Was that graph even real, I mean how can that information be gathered? Is there a way for someone to know that or was it based on surveys?
@_date: 2019-07-13 21:02:39
Why not use Localbitcoins? It's peer to peer as all things should be, it has its risks of course but you can get a better price for your bitcoin
@_date: 2019-07-10 23:39:04
Ok, so, what I'm getting out of this is that this forks are like parallel alt coins? So why is say there is over 100 mil BTC? Again, I'm new to all this, I'm just trying to figure it out.
@_date: 2019-07-13 13:25:41
Newbie here. If you hace your private keys never touching the web, how will it sync with the block chain? I mean, to my understanding it is supposed to be connected to the Internet to sync with everyone else's wallets? I think the more i dig into bitcoin the less I understand.
@_date: 2019-07-08 16:27:02
So what do you think will replace fiat?
@_date: 2019-07-24 02:11:45
Nice point, too bad years of videogames have ruined my imagination.
@_date: 2019-08-23 15:58:51
That's awesome, thanks for the insight on cars! I love it when people is that passionate about something.
Now regarding pizza. Yes indeed, but what if pizza's intrinsic value was in its usefulness as a currency, since everyone will accept pizza wherever you go and in whatever size you present it.
Wouldn't scarcity (at some elevated point) affect the demand for said pizza? If I pizza can only be used to purchase things and I as a manufacturer will always be getting less and less pizza in exchange for my products (due to deflation) wouldn't that discourage me from accepting pizza as payment?
Now listen, I'm not Peter Schiffting right now. I'm just trying to wrap my head around the concept od deflation because it is honestly a very alien concept for me.
@_date: 2019-08-23 13:31:46
Because is a publicly owned pizza, you have 1/10th of pizza and so do I. I hide my slice and then die. There's now no way for anyone to retrieve my slice. Now we have less slices.
I didn't know that about lambo. That makes my scenario more worrisome. Remember what happened the last time that Germany's economy crashed?
@_date: 2019-08-15 16:07:34
So today is payday but I can't buy BTC until I'm home (I don't carry my passwords with me) first time my paycheck matches a dip!
@_date: 2019-08-15 20:12:47
That really unFOMOed me.
@_date: 2019-08-24 12:45:58
Wow I get it now. Thanks for the explanation!!
@_date: 2019-08-23 12:36:30
You're explaining basic math, which I understand. What I don't understand is basic economics.
The thing is if you use pizza as a currency splitimg it into x amount of slices won't affect your purchasing power. So if a lambo costs 1/10th of a pizza and pizza slices start to dissappear less people will be able to afford lambos.
If less people can afford lambos Lamborghini will run out of business thus ruining Italian economy.
Now change lambos for bread or beef. Again I'm trying to understand basic economics and that's what makes sense to me.
@_date: 2019-08-23 03:06:02
Makes sense, actually I feel my question is now too dumb.
@_date: 2019-08-14 02:07:59
Is it normal that I don't do that anymore after like a month?
@_date: 2019-08-15 17:18:35
How do we know that?
@_date: 2019-06-20 02:38:14
So it's like another wallet?
@_date: 2019-06-03 20:09:17
Shit man, that's impressive!

Nice! Good luck ti you too
@_date: 2019-06-29 14:02:01
Well I use Localbitcoins the fee is less than a dollar
@_date: 2019-06-27 21:28:31
So, I've noticed that btc is cheaper on some exchanges than others. Why is that? Sadly, I can only use one exchange due to region restrictions and that's precisely the cheapest one I've seen. But in theory, I could buy BTC cheap in one exchange and sell at regular price in another exchange and profit, couldn't I? Am I missing something?
@_date: 2019-06-27 20:44:10
Yeah, my first purchase was actually at 8k, I'm still in the green, but yesterday... Jesus I wasn't ready for yesterday.
@_date: 2019-06-03 03:39:26
Seriously man this is so helpful for me right now. Things are starting to make sense.  
I sincerely appreciate you taking the time to explain this. I hope I'll be able to help someone like this in the future!
@_date: 2019-06-05 04:32:08
Hoping for the same here. We get a bonus next 15th it would be nice to have a major dip
@_date: 2019-06-26 18:20:50
MAKE IT STAHP! I got in at 8k but didn't commit to it now I'm here stuck with less than a tenth of btc fomoing until my next paycheck.
@_date: 2019-06-13 11:34:57
How long until BTC stabilises? 
So we all talk about how btc is going to be worth millions in te future. But realistically, btc was thought as a currency, but using btc as a currency  right now is pretty inconvenient due to its volatility.
I believe in BTC but if it cannot be used for what it was meant for its future is very dire.
So again, instead of the usual discussion of btc is going to be worth x millions in y years, does anyone has an estimated on how long this volatility period will last?
@_date: 2019-06-24 15:09:48
Please stay at 10.000 until the next paycheck pleaseeee!
@_date: 2019-06-13 16:37:25
Awesome response, thanks for sharing your thoughts!
@_date: 2019-06-28 00:00:23

@_date: 2019-06-26 22:59:57
@_date: 2019-06-26 14:52:28
I'm not scared to buy. All the opposite. Hell if I'm not buying on next paycheck, I just wish I had started buying earlier. My goal is having 0.1 at least, but with current prices it's gonna take even longer. More so considering the currency I get paid in is waaaay weaker than the usd.
So, yeah. I boarded the moon train, I'm just afraid when they come asking for the tickets my ticket wont get me that far...
@_date: 2019-06-27 19:45:45
Actually, I panic bought yesterday and now I feel dumb.
@_date: 2019-06-22 14:50:23
As someone with less than a quarter of btc. PLEASE STAAAAHP
@_date: 2019-06-28 04:33:40
Well I hope I'll feel dumb some years from now for feeling dumb for buying at 13k
@_date: 2019-06-02 14:19:56
Awesome! Thanks a lot!
@_date: 2019-06-27 19:45:00
I'm a newbie and I was more bothered by the sudden increase. I need it to go lower so I can buy more!
@_date: 2019-06-18 13:27:50
I used bitcoin.org to get links to official wallet websites. I really thought it wa official. Do you think my information might be compromised?
@_date: 2019-06-13 18:50:08
What do they mean with regulate further?
@_date: 2019-06-22 12:55:56
That wouldn't make btc supply infinite? That would be like creating more basically wouldn't it?
@_date: 2019-06-19 12:13:23
Maybe it is because this image gives hope to all of us who invest faith in BTC due to the fact that we're in dead end jobs and hope to find sudden success regardless of the poor decisions we made in life. Most of us are millennials so we're also reaching 30 years of age, so yeah. But hey! Moonbound... don't bury me on down votes please.
@_date: 2019-06-27 23:23:46
My exchange is p2p so I usually buy for a rate lower than what Google shows, is that normal, what does Google uses to tell the price of btc
@_date: 2019-06-27 22:54:30
What is the spread? I am very new to crypto so I'm sorry if my questions are way too dumb
@_date: 2019-06-19 17:16:44
So if I do my own hardware wallet using a USB is it going to be the same? How easy is it to mess that up? And if I lose my hardware wallet do I lose all my btc? Or does it has a seed like software wallets?
@_date: 2019-06-04 22:16:17
I wish I had hoped in to bitcoin earlier, not for the profit, but to be able to understand the memes.
@_date: 2019-06-19 15:53:44
Hi, I keep hearing about hardware wallets, what's the difference between software and hardware wallets. And what's the difference between a hardware wallet and the usb flash alternative you mention?
@_date: 2019-06-12 18:11:32
Only?? I have a fraction of that!
@_date: 2019-06-13 16:12:24
Haha well you can't have a discussion online without some downvotes nothing to worry about.
I understand that the value will be freezed during the transaction period, but let's go one step further.
What if you were to set a wage in BTC. We have to consider that most of the wealth is generated by working (or at least for the average joe). And we can't use a currency to purchase goods if we don't have the currency to begin with.
Mankind revolves around simplicity and getting payed in dollars to buy btc to later buy goods is a concept that although not impossible, I think ot will be harder for the everyday man to grasp.
Now don't get me wrong. I do believe BTC is the future, everything about it is good and is what we need (hell, I even own a tiny small amount of it). But reality is often not about what we need but about what works (or what works for the banks).
So to rephrase my initial question. Do you think we're going to reach that point? Do you have an estimate of it?
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:06:55
IDK about that. Back at 7k I was waiting for another 3k dip and ended up buying at 8k. Maybe if I wait for another dip the mofo ends up going straight to 50k.
@_date: 2019-06-26 15:35:08

@_date: 2019-06-18 18:57:24
Ok just one question. If fb coin fails, wouldn't it affect the trust of the mainstream on other crypto currencies Like BTC? I mean, I can imaginenthe average fb thot/Karen saying things like "if libra failed and it was backed by a reliable company like fb, I ain't using BTC since its backed by no one"
@_date: 2019-06-02 21:15:17
Thanks a lot for taking the time to type all that! That was very useful, people keep recommending no to leave my BTC on exchanges, just one quick question, the exchange websites will charge me for sending the BTC I acquire to my personal Wallet?  
I currently can't afford a hardware wallet, which software one would you say is the safest?
Thanks a lot!
@_date: 2019-06-26 18:37:52

Ok, so Bitcoin has been "dead" for at least a million times, but also this has been the millionth "last" chance to buy BTC cheap. Can we all agree that there's no way of predicting this thing's price and that both sides of the spectrum are retarded.
