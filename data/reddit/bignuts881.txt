Is bitcoin lending worth it? How do I do it? And what are the trusted less risky places to do it?

Nope, bitcoin will reach 25,346 at exactly 18:32 on the 9th of December

It’s hard to answer, the stockmarket hasn’t really tanked since crypto has been so massive. My guess is they would just pull money out if they weren’t already investing some into crypto before it tanked.

I agree but I don’t consider these cheap, badly researched and clickbaity articles to be worth even a second of anyone’s time.

Mercatox are holding all XRB’s hostage... your arent allowed to withdraw due to “maintainance” so the only option is to sell for BTC then transfer to bitgrail to rebuy

This is the end

Bitcoin morphs into a physical being called Bitman at 18:36
@_date: 2017-12-19 13:15:08
I need to transfer my XRB out of Mercatox 
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:37:15
Buying now is maybe a bad idea... very high chance it will drop... but I said maybe because I have no idea and nobody else does either 
@_date: 2017-12-19 13:13:35
How long was the transfer time
@_date: 2017-12-10 09:50:46
we need noobies to make bitcoin work

Maybe he’s waiting for the right moment to sell them and buy XRB

If this is real I’ll eat my left ball 
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:50:09
What if he only invests because it makes him feel cool an unique

Have you ever considered blowing your own head off?
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:53:47
It’s seems obvious now but nobody could have been sure it would come this far. If you invested in every start-up you’d be broke.

If I took career/financial advice from you I'd be giving my son spending money in DogeCoin
